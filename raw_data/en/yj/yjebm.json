They are guilty of fraud and manslaughter. The so-called \"AIDS test\" is unreliable, invalid, and completely misleading; it inaccurately and undependably tests for immunity to an innocent virus. On the basis of a meaningless test, individuals are subjected to the killer drug AZT. All of the studies on AZT are fraudulent and misleading, including the first study which resulted in the licensing of this drug. The Food and Drug Administration of the United States, which licensed AZT, is aware of this fact and has not recalled it; they are guilty of criminal negligence and genocide.

Our mothers and fathers said there was a Santa Claus, an Easter bunny, and a tooth fairy. Of course, we all believed it. After all, it was mom and dad who said they existed. And besides, we were only children. The evidence seemed so convincing: there were presents under the tree, colorful eggs hidden in strange places, and money under the pillow. It took maturity and facing the facts of life to make us cognizant of the truth. Most of us painfully gave up the myth. Now as adults ... For ten years we have been told by our scientists, our government and the media that there is a contagious epidemic called AIDS, and of course we all believe it. After all, it is the \"authorities\" that say so. Besides, now we are adults and we know better, it must be the truth \u2014 the evidence is so convincing; there are millions with the disease, they found the virus, and they even have a test for it! Due What if it is a myth? What if AIDS is 25 old diseases which are given a new name? What if the facts are against the viral theory and there is no proof the virus causes anything? What if the numbers are only predictions that have proven to be 91% wrong during the first ten years? What if the test is completely unreliable? What if the causes of acquired immune deficiency have been known for over sixty years? What if those causes are more prevalent now than ever before? What if the drug used to treat AIDS causes AIDS? What if the evidence is overwhelming that sex has nothing to do with AIDS? What if giving up this myth may save your life? ; = THOS QVOTToa Las _. aew espe tT hits e writin Pi ' is | ie wu f ij ) j 'y i sia ' hee ' , j ae | Be: Te a4 : Ss ! iT \" i ie 7 ' \\ ig : i t , : aeshry f : HER OGRE. abe x! ~ - \u00a2 tf i { : c a) rt 3 IN isga : ' vt 1euha \" viled Ses r) y tan! i O16 De \" 4 ' ' ai ! c \"i } ul . by if) 4 \"5 ( + 4 (te is 3 he { ,*% : 7} iJ ie. > Been\" a i ivr? tar , ' \u00ae b ushaae 4 aA \\ } if av 'Test i\u00a2 '7 eh) ee PAu ele hed 2 ag Veod gugc uniretotion amin DE poe FOR 3 VYusoy Ale RAG Ve \" f af 1 Ws \u00b0 . re - Corstod vaunted OOF ie | Ph: ae ot ( ae np: Oy aematebifo lod rises \" : > eu eae iv iP SF | = Te i Ras ean ea f i Wy th o- ae reat fi in on a yb X V ; CONTENTS ... ioessiessvescevaesssevecteatestedeeeecsbevueusteevessees XXXIII Chapter 1 THE HISTORY OF THE AIDS EPIDEMIC EE CHESEO AID 68 Ned asiss c+ on tee ETICSTEA SEIS 11 cpa eta Seg ene ere Ne, ete ate athaeett 6 Beeeeeould They Get AWay WII It7......,.c.cosssoonrcceserccesessssonpnaee 7 Chapter 2 THE SUPPOSED EVIDENCE Supporting the Hypothesis that HIV Causes AIDS..................4. 11 Chapter 3 THE EVIDENCE Disproving HIV Causes AIDS ........:...:0:s+50-s:avespeassesshegeanan 23 ETHOIOSY Vicsservsesectasvoseceysussosus\u00a5oteccerdacssacersesassseisyeey<aray elit 24 Chapter 4 EPIDEMIOLOGY AIDS is Not Contagious, (It Does Not Spread)...............sseeee oy Annual.

IT IS NOT BASED ON FACT, IT IS FACT. IT IS NOT BASED ON HYPOTHESES, IT IS FACT. If after reading this book you are not convinced by the factual and incontrovertible evidence presented, then the title of this book was well chosen. You have been victimized by the \"DEADLY DECEPTION\". The words you are reading now were written after the first draft of the manuscript was completed. I gave the manuscript to many individuals from all walks of life to determine what was left unan- swered or where doubt still remained. The effort was well worth the investment in time and money. Their comments and questions were a revelation. It is imperative that you know the truth and that every question you could possibly ask is answered completely. The remaining doubts of some of the many who reviewed the manuscript per- suaded me to return to my computer and stress the salient and vital facts which escaped the reader. The basic, fundamental, cardinal, quintessential and vital ques- tions will be answered here in the preface and throughout the book. Forgive the repetition, but the web of lies has created a deception so thick and for so long, that it takes a chain saw to cut through the truth. In spite of 30 years' experience in medicine, I realized that it took me four years before I suspected there was something wrong with the AIDS hypothesis. It took another five years for me to sort out the truth. Let logic and truth replace the monumental lies. In order for each section to be completely coherent without the reader having to search back through the pages to recollect an important fact, I repeated the information for purposes of clarity and emphasis. The deception is about the AIDS \"epidemic\". It is not, how- ever, a singular deception. It is an intricate maze of lies, lies based on other lies, guesses, and distorted circumstantial evidence. It is \"science\" based on a misinformed consensus of honest physicians and researchers who trustingly accepted the hypotheses as verified fact. For ten years the American people and the world have been victims of an astounding fraud. It is comparable to, but far more effective than, Hitler's big lie in deceiving humanity. The majority of mankind was not even born when a short black-haired megalo- maniac with a little black mustache convinced 60 million people, one of the most scientifically-advanced nations of the world that they were the blond-haired, blue-eyed aryan master race. It is inconceivable that a people more intelligent than most could have been led into the most destructive war mankind has ever known. Yet, today, lies potentially more dangerous then Hitler's are being disseminated by unsuspecting governments, the World Health Organization, and a media power that couldn't even be imagined in Hitler's time. DEADLY DECEPTION (The Most Important Lies) LIE I. AIDS is Caused by the HIV Virus. LIE II. AIDS is Contagious. LIE III. A Positive HIV Test Means Death by AIDS. LIE IV. AZT is a Treatment for AIDS. LIE V. AIDS Has No Cure. THE FACTS (The Real Truth) I. AIDS is caused by drugs and malnutrition (starvation) and the virus has nothing to do with it. II. The test for HIV is completely inaccurate, predicts nothing, and can cause severe illness through intense fear. Il. AZT, the main drug used in treatment, causes AIDS. The brainwashing has been so incredibly effective that your first impulse will be to think that this book is the product of one of those ridiculous tabloids. However, everything in this book is factually documented. Many of the best and brightest scientists now condemn the AIDS deception and it originators. The perpetrators of the AIDS fraud are named. They dare not sue their accusers and go to court because their crime would be exposed and their growing tens of millions of dollars in profit would dry up. They have cleverly involved thousands of individu- als and corporations, most of whom are decently motivated, in their despicable scheme. Worse, they have millions of scientists and physicians who, relatively ignorant in their arcane science, trust- ingly accept the deluge of fabricated, sophisticated, and wildly pseudo-scientific speculations as scientific fact. Then, with an army of duped and believing scientist followers, they back up their atrocious scam with the idiotic proposition that the proof of the AIDS hypothesis lies in the fact that so many believe in it. Although 60 thousand papers have been written with money obtained from AIDS grants, not one of those papers proves scien- tifically that the virus causes AIDS. The original papers UPON which the AIDS hypothesis was based are a sorry pretense of scientific investigation, based on the worst kind of circumstantial evidence and then presented to the scientific community and the world as proven facts. The major perpetrator of the scam, Dr. Robert Gallo, has been found guilty of \"scientific misconduct,\" an interesting euphemism for scheming, lying thievery. When finally brought to trial for his real crime, his defense will undoubtedly be that the AIDS hypoth- esis has never been anything but an hypothesis, and thus he will try to escape responsibility. The facts of this sordid affair, if justice prevails, should convict him of criminal negligence, fraud and manslaughter. The monies that have been wasted in misdirected research, criminally negligent double-blind studies, fraudulent deadly therapy, invalid testing, and illegitimate profiteering, could eradicate the real AIDS from our planet. After reading this book, some of you will, because of a ten-year media blitz of misinformation, still ask the question, \"Then why are so many people dying of a disease we never heard of before?\" The answer: I. AIDS is simply a new name for 25 diseases that have always existed. Il. The causes of acquired immune deficiency have been listed in medical texts for over 70 years. They are, in order of impor- tance: malnutrition (starvation), drugs, radiation, and che- motherapy. Ill. It appeared to be an epidemic at first, because the drug- addicted segment of the gay population began to suffer the effects from years of drug use. They became an identifiable group when they came out of the closet just prior to the \"epidemic\". IV. AIDS in Africa is what it has always been \u2014 slow starvation and malnutrition \u2014 and it hasn't changed at all, except for the name. Simply compare any AIDS patient with the appearance of a crack cocaine baby or the horrible television pictures of starving Somalians, or prisoners in the concentration camps of XXII Bosnia-Herzgovena and Nazi Germany. The epidemic in Africa simply does not exist. It has been an invention based on completely false information provided by indigent families seeking funds from charitable agencies and also by AIDS workers seeking to protect lucrative jobs. The statistics re- leased are all unverified estimates that have proven to be 91% wrong. . Hemophiliacs get AIDS in small numbers because of additives and contaminants in their frequent blood transfusions. This book gives you proof it is not HIV. . AZT, a drug so toxic that it was discarded as a treatment for cancer, and which causes AIDS, is being given to individuals because they tested positive for antibodies to an innocent virus. They will die of an acquired immune deficiency caused by AZT \u2014 and many of them are perfectly healthy!

The deadly decep- tion of AIDS warns us of an even more serious threat to our lives, our freedoms and our economy: \"The Medical-Pharmaceutical Complex\" This alliance fiercely resists and destroys all opposition to their false and restrictive concepts of disease and its cause. This con- Spiracy of arrogance, ignorance and greed is costing hundreds of thousands of lives and wasting more than 200 billion dollars yearly. The AIDS fraud is just one example of this catastrophe. We will lose the war against AIDS, just as we have lost the war against cancer; we will never win the war against either, unless we understand that the cause of all disease is an acquired immune system deficiency or direct damage to cells, whether it be via the contamination of our world, ourselves, or, in a rare instance, ge- netically acquired. We do not \"catch\" any disease; we simply succumb to our maladaptation to the environment, pollution of ourselves or pollu- tion of the environment. If this were not true, then the first \"epi- demic\" on earth would have been our last. The epidemics and plagues of history killed millions, but more lived than died \u2014 why? The survivors have always been those whose immune systems and defenses were intact. A healthy individual is one who has adapted to all of the conditions and everything that occupies our planet. This includes not only bacteria and viruses, but the air, the water, the plants and all inhabitants, including our fellow human beings. We have altered our environment more in the past century than nature has over many millions of years. If we alter or destroy the ecosystem without the time or ability to adapt, disease and death will surely follow. There are better ways. They have been known for thousands of years. THE CHALLENGE TO HIV, ARC and AIDS There are three important components of the AIDS hypotheses which are being challenged as completely fraudulent, and are at the core of a criminal conspiracy and negligence which are unequalled in history. They are: THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV), is a virus that was initially discovered in the blood of several AIDS patients. It was hypothesized that the virus caused AIDS simply because it was there. However, there is no scientific evidence that indicates this virus is pathogenic (capable of causing disease in humans) and causes AIDS or any other disease. THE AIDS RELATED COMPLEX (ARC) has also been re- ferred to as \"pre-AIDS\". It makes reference to the complex of symptoms developed prior to the onset of one of the diseases of AIDS. In medicine the symptoms are often called \"non-specific\" and include such things as fever, glandular swelling, weight loss, diarrhea, etc. THE ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) is a syndrome and not a disease, just as its name implies. It is a collection of an ever-growing number of diseases which have been placed in one pot. It is like a vegetable soup containing many vegetables; except that in this soup, all the vegetables are supposed to come from only one seed. Now, if that is confusing, they will provide you with 41 different explanations or hypotheses, as to how this might be possible. These explanations are all figments of constipated thought and there is no laboratory evidence confirming them. id sinnly PEE NYE TARE ru ORO cy? > - + = 7 ' ape ' fey id y RAT de RDINE 4) 2 ; 7 ' ry i * , ara : ryt yt el ' 1 : ' . i F ' \"Ma 4 4 \" . | \u00e9 ; s) > ' Ne - f tart - ny 4 f ' 4 pF Us AWiseaeds YX Pat!

FACT Probably most, if not all, of the causes of AIDS are already known (for over 70 years) and HIV does not qualify as one of them. FACT HIV was decreed as the cause of AIDS by a politician and a virologist who has been found guilty of \"'scientific misconduct\". FACT Condoms cannot stop a disease that is caused by starvation and drugs. FACT As long as the deaths due to starvation are blamed on the \"AIDS virus', the responsibility of ineffectual and corrupt governments for the real cause will remain unchallenged, hun- dreds of billions of dollars will be wasted, and ineffectual and deadly treatments will be employed.

STATEMENT Be prepared to read what may seem to be unbelievable. But, be assured that everything presented has been fully documented and is factual. This is not some wild, unfounded theory about CIA agents testing a potential biological weapon on unsuspecting gays in the United States or on Blacks in Africa; nor is it an equally ridiculous story of green monkeys, or a concocted preposterous theory about a contaminated vaccine (although our government has sadly admitted to similar crimes). It is a true account of perfidy for profit and power. Many incredible crimes against humanity have been perpe- trated by tyrants, and often even in the name of \"God\". This is the true story of a small group of scientists, government officials and pharmaceutical executives who have turned their backs on science and humanity for personal gain. We are witnessing what may become the greatest genocide in the history of mankind caused by fraudulent diagnosis and treatment and misdirected research. There is what appears to be an epidemic of acquired immune deficiency diseases. However the well-known causes of these con- ditions have been treacherously and maliciously misrepresented and replaced by a retro-virus, which cannot possibly be respon- sible. The human immunodeficiency virus is a myth. It is not at all what it is claimed to be. This document will present the hard facts in contradistinction to the purely hypothetical conjecture and dis- tortion of what is now referred to as AIDS. The motives are money and power. Recently, more than 500 of the world's most prominent scientists banded together and formed the \"Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis\". The founder of this group is Dr. Charles A. Thomas, a Harvard biologist. The impetus for this action began in 1987 when the world's most knowledgeable and honored retrovirologist, Dr. Peter Duesberg XXXI of the University of California at Berkeley, challenged the HIV- AIDS hypothesis in the journal, CANCER RESEARCH. The purpose of this book is to explain in language that can be understood by all, what I believe, is the most despicable, shocking and malignant deception. It has the potential to exceed the Holo- caust in its toll on human life. It will be this deadly deception, and not aids, that will be responsible for this genocide. I do not wish to be diplomatic or mince words, because there is no time for diplomacy. Mass manslaughter is being committed by a few scientists who have knowingly and purposely misled thousands of their trusting colleagues in a carnage that could be unparalleled in history. They cannot claim ignorance, for they have answered serious scientific challenges with slander instead of proof. They have used unsuspecting, well- meaning physicians to deliver their victims into the arms of death. This horrendous murder and profiteering must be stopped now! Robert E. Willner, M.D., Ph.D. IN DEDICATION TO: A continuing fulfillment of The Oath of Hippocrates. A passion for the pursuit of truth, the enlightenment of hun- dreds of thousands of sincere, conscientious and devoted physi- cians and public servants; and to the education and salvation of millions of human beings, throughout the world, who are at risk of being murdered by a hoax so incredible that it almost defies belief. Dr. Peter Deusberg, who unselfishly has risked his life's work, his many honors and his fortune by his courageous expose of the unconscionable deadly deception known as the AIDS epi- demic; and to the many renowned scientists who are daily swelling the ranks of men and women throughout the world that are de- manding an investigation and an end to this incredible, scandalous deceit. An unyielding determination to establish truth and obtain the indictment of a group of conspirators in medical research, the pharmaceutical industry and in government agencies who have perpetrated history's greatest and most deadly deceit on mankind for monstrous immoral, economic and political purposes. A moral obligation to the few thousand physicians who cou- rageously march to the beat of a different drummer. At the great personal risk of their right to earn a living in research and practic- ing medicine, they reject the near-sighted, corrupt and destructive approaches of establishment medicine. They truly follow the Hippocratic tradition and, with an open mind, draw upon thousands of years of medical experience to help and to heal. These are the physicians who still obey the edict: \"above all, do no harm\". My children and yours, above all, who deserve a better life where fear and lies do not deprive them of the right to choose their way of living it and preserving it. Robert E.

In 1980, Dr. Robert Gallo, a retrovirologist with the National Cancer Institute, discovered the first human retrovirus (HTLV-1). A retrovirus is distinguished from an ordinary virus by virtue of the fact that their RNA is converted to DNA by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. Its replication and survival is totally de- pendent on the viability of the host cell. If the host cell dies, the virus is finished. Dr. Gallo knew this basic fact; however, he would soon purposely ignore this fact in order to serve his own needs by claiming that the virus was very \"mysterious\". Somehow it would mysteriously survive while mysteriously slaughtering T-cells by the millions (this has never been observed). He had contended in the past, but failed to prove, that the very same retrovirus (HTLV-1) caused a specific type of leukemia which was occurring in Japan. The power of position, that of being a top government official and scientist, has allowed the erroneous label DEADL Y DECEPTION of \"leukemia virus\" to remain intact even though it was rejected by the scientific community. In 1981, it was proposed that an acquired immune deficiency was the basis for a new syndrome of diseases (AIDS) that appeared to be surfacing amongst promiscuous male homosexuals and intra- venous drug users. Dr. David Durack, of Duke University, a rec- ognized expert on infectious diseases and the immune system, though admitting the prevalence of drug use (particularly \"pop- pers\" or amy] nitrite) and repeated multiple infections, ignored these well known causes of immune deficiency and announced that this \"truly new syndrome\" must be due to \"some new factor\". Continuously this group of scientists has resorted to theory, not fact, as to how the AIDS virus supposedly accomplishes its dirty deeds. The words, \"it is thought\", are constantly used in casual conversations or.in the non-scientific articles and popular maga- zines and books. In the scientific journals or at lectures the theory is presented as established fact although there are no facts in- volved. It is portrayed as an established truth and therefore is accepted as such by most scientists, including physicians. The so- called HIV virus is still referred to as a \"new\" virus in spite indisputable evidence to the contrary. Incorrectly, the virus has been characterized as \"attacking\" or \"infiltrating\" the immune system, when in reality this is impossible because it is not alive and does not invade. Retroviruses are engulfed by the cells and incor- porated into the cell's life processes. In 1983, Dr. Gallo embarked on a mission to convince his fellow scientists, in the absence of any scientific experimental proof whatsoever, that another virus he had discovered caused AIDS . At a widely publicized press conference held in Washing- ton, D.C. on April 23, 1984, Dr. Gallo announced that he had discovered the cause of AIDS. He claimed the unearthing of a new retrovirus which he had named HTLV-III, thus inferring that it was a member of the family of retroviruses he had previously discov- ered. His claim was bolstered by Margaret Heckler, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, who was under great pressure to come up with some answer to the looming \"epi- demic\". Heckler acclaimed, \"Today we add another miracle to the long honor roll of American medicine and science.\" She also promised that we would have a vaccine within two years, undoubt- edly as a result of Dr. Gallo's grandiose urgings. That very day, Dr. 2 Gallo filed a U.S. patent for an HIV test kit which was destined to make him very wealthy. Dr. Gallo, unquestionably very knowl- edgeable in retrovirology, chose to set aside the facts and became the quintessential, intellectual whore. The benefits to Dr. Gallo are money and power; but the costs to humanity are suffering and countless unnecessary deaths. In contrast, street prostitutes are honest \u2014 you know what you're getting and you know the risks \u2014 and, by the way, AIDS is not one of them. Margaret Heckler very quickly awarded the lucrative contract for AZT to Burroughs-Wellcome Pharmaceutical Company before the first scientific paper ever appeared in any U.S. journal. AZT was a drug in search of a disease. It had been sitting on the shelves of the National Institutes of Health since the 1960's. It was an experimental drug that had failed as a cancer remedy and had been declared too toxic to use. Retrovirology had gained impor- tance because of Nixon's \"war on cancer\" and the belief that a retrovirus might be the cause of cancer in humans. This approach seemed logical at the time, because retroviruses typically prompted cells to multiply \u2014 a characteristic of the cancer process. This is directly opposite to the cell destruction that normally occurs in viral infections. Not only did that war fail, AZT failed, and retrovirologists came up empty-handed after twenty years of in- tense and arduous research. Alas, a whole group of scientists without a raison d'etre! As you would expect, in 1986, The Inter- national Committee of Retrovirologists named HIV the cause of AIDS. By giving credence to the hypothesis in the absence of proof, they became party to the conspiracy. It is just what one would expect when frustrated unsuccessful foxes are left to guard the hen house. | Adding to Dr. Gallo's blatant disregard for all established scientific requirements for validation of his claims, it was eventu- ally discovered that HLTV-III was a retrovirus that had been sent to Dr. Gallo more than a year before by Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris. On several occasions, Montagnier had sent samples of the virus he had isolated in the blood of some AIDS patients for Gallo's evaluation. A scandal erupted and a battle ensued over the credit for the discovery and the rights to the patents. It took the intervention of the French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and U.S. President Ronald Reagan in order to reach an agreement that resulted in the sharing of the proceeds and the 3 DEADL Y DECEPTION credit for the discovery (recently challenged again by the French after Gallo admitted he may have made a mistake). It is truly characteristic of scoundrels to quarrel over the spoils of fraud. It is important to point out from the beginning that the acronym AIDS represents the official and scientific designation of the \"disease\", ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYN- DROME, which is discussed, examined and critiqued in this book. The inevitable conclusions which a growing number of many prominent scientists have reached, and, which I am sure, you will also, is that AIDS fits neither the definition of a disease, nor of a syndrome. It is merely the lumping together of an ever- increasing number of diseases and symptoms, 25 at the last count (depending on the source), in order to fraudulently cre- ate the impression that an epidemic exists. Keep in mind that Gallo and his cohorts have been getting away with the most elementary unscientific ploy one could imagine. They have avoided performing scientific controlled studies that would be universally accepted as proof. Such studies would un- mask their fraud. They have instead relied on fear, intimidation, sensationalism, greed, ambition, envy and the need for recognition. In this way they have coerced and stupefied an army of followers into believing what, in the past, would have been laughed at, or dismissed as coincidence and/or \"anecdotal\". HIV has been made the scapegoat for incompetence, and a gateway to the lifestyle of the rich, famous and powerful, for unscrupulous, immoral and incompetent scoundrels. The blitzkrieg of misinformation has oblit- erated from consideration even the most elementary knowledge, logic and evidence in research and disease. We have known for more than half a century that we co-exist with many bacteria and viruses. We are well aware that potentially deadly organisms reside within us at all times, waiting only for the balance of health to be tipped in favor of \"disease\". Streptococcus, tuberculosis and Pneumocystis carnii, the most common \"compo- nents\" of AIDS, are but a fraction of the infectious organisms that the majority of us live with constantly. Pneumocystis carnii are present in the lungs of virtually every individual on the surface of our planet. Yet, precious few of us ever get the disease they cause: pneumocystis pneumonia. This is just one of the most obvious 4 examples of the basic and pervasive flaws in the guiding premises of \"modern\" medicine. Consider, for the moment, the following question: When the great flu of 1919 took the lives of millions of people in the United States, Why didn't the entire population succumb? When the great bubonic plague destroyed one-third of the population of Europe, why didn't the other two-thirds die also? Why didn't everyone die? The answer: When an epidemic destroys its susceptible population, it ceases to exist. In other words, it is the inability of the individual's immune system that determines the degree to which an individual \"falls ill\" or whether or not he becomes ill at all. As Pasteur is purported to have exclaimed on his deathbed, \"It is not the organ- ism, It is the terrain!\" If this were not true, then everyone, in the examples cited above, would have gotten the plague or the flu and all would have died. In fact, the first disease on earth would have been the last! The deceivers of infamy have succeeded in creating a chain of events that have destroyed logic and common sense, and in their place, established the following \"Commandments\" for Science, government, the press and the public: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF FRAUD Coincidence is proof of cause and effect. Circumstantial evidence is direct evidence. One example proves the rule. One guess supported by another guess creates a fact. Saying it is so, makes it so. Don't confuse the issue with facts. Proof is unnecessary and should be avoided. . Lie, lie, lie and they'll believe it. Silence, ignore and suppress the truth. Replace reason with dogma, fraud and blindfolded fear. XRSSS<288\" The repeated use of these commandments by the conspirators prompted T. C. Fry to comment in his book, THE GREAT AIDS 5 DEADL Y DECEPTION HOAX; ''...the presence of what they call HIV in the disease (AIDS) is no more proof of cause than the presence of flies in garbage proves that the flies are the cause of garbage.\" There could be an exception however, if you consider that the \"AIDS Gang\": Robert Gallo, Anthony Fauci, William Bolognesi, ret Fischler, Margaret Heckler et al., are the flies; then indeed, the garbage was created by them! 2 8 2 2 2 8 2 OK OR RR oR OK OK BR OK OB OK OB OB OB BOR BOR KK RK A GLIMMER OF LIGHT \"Character assassination in response to challenge, is tacit evi- dence of an indefensible position\" \u2014 REW In 1987, the light of truth had begun to pierce their facade. For these conspirators, it was the harbinger of their downfall (if justice prevails). It began when Dr. Peter Duesberg, an international au- thority on retroviruses, published an article in Cancer Research which shook the very foundation of the HIV-AIDS theory. Many scientists were stunned by his position, but impressed by its truth. Others were relieved that someone had the courage to finally speak up. The powerbrokers and vested interests counter-attacked, not with scientific argument and fact, but with name-calling, character assassination, vitriolic insinuations, denigration, and political and economic reprisal. Their actions and their words only verified their guilt. Then, in February 1989, Dr. Duesberg submitted a masterful comprehensive analysis to The Proceedings of the National Acad- emy of Sciences. This prestigious group has ignored this document and taken no action. In the political and scientific worlds, this is usually the safest way of covering your assets. If you are eventually found out, you can always claim that there wasn't convincing evidence. Meanwhile, millions have died! During the past four years, the classical AIDS combination of characteristic features has been reported in individuals who tested negative for HIV, and the number is growing steadily. Of course, the charlatans were quick to \"hypothesize\" that there must be another \"virus\" causing it, lest their gambit be discovered. Still another attempt to divert attention from the most important and obvious, scientifically established causes \u2014 DRUGS. 6 They concede now that the virus can't do it alone; that the \"'co- factors\" are necessary. However, we have known that the \"co- factors\" have caused immunodeficiencies for many decades, by themselves, long before HIV was discovered. It is HIV that is not necessary for AIDS. HOW COULD THEY GET AWAY WITH THIS INCREDIBLE FRAUD? How could this happen? Surely, it's not possible that a fraud of this magnitude could ever escape the scrutiny of the thousands of scientists throughout the world who have been researching the many avenues of investigation into this \"modern day plague\". It all began with the retrovirologists whose area of expertise is so arcane that most scientists in other fields are quite unfamiliar with it. I, myself, read with complete acceptance the early articles in the medical journals, newspapers and popular magazines. Who could doubt the declarations of the powerful and influential governmen- tal departments, agencies and scientific enclaves? Although the many claims made for the virus did not sit easily with me, it was several years before I, almost instinctively, began to doubt what I was reading. I guess it was because of two and a half decades of practicing medicine, that the gradual exposure to the failures and inconsistencies of establishment medicine and its resistance to deviation from the mandated dogmatic approach to disease, I learned to question the pablum I had been trained to digest. At first it was the insane, irrational and contradictory therapy that I could not accept. But then, when I attended a dinner at which Dr. Margaret Fischl described her infamous \"double-blind\" study on AZT, the first drug presented for the treatment of AIDS, I knew something foul was going on. Finally, when I traveled to a meeting in Los Angeles during February 1989, dealing with alternative approaches to AIDS, at which I heard Dr. Peter Duesberg speak, I ultimately questioned the validity of the disease itself. I had finally become educated about retroviruses by the most knowledgeable man in the field. Until that time I had been presented theory as fact. Like the rest of my colleagues, I assumed that what I had been taught was proven and therefore believed it to be true. The truth became apparent: AIDS was all supposition, theory, pseudo-scien- tific, and a scam. Because it was all based on less-than-scientific 4 DEADL Y DECEPTION papers, the most fragile type of circumstantial evidence and self- serving hypotheses, HIV had been indicted, convicted and \"sen- tenced\" falsely of a \"crime\" it could not possibly have committed. What about the retrovirologists themselves? How could they have been fooled? In an article written for the magazine The Truth Seeker (September/October, 1989), Dr. Duesberg explained the reasons. \"After a frustrating 20-year-long search for a human cancer virus, the club (the retrovirologists) was craving for some clinical relevance for the retrovirus and hence, happily adopted HIV \u2014 the AIDS virus \u2014 as the cause of AIDS.\" He went on to explain the impact of the powerful promotion that made the AIDS hypothesis \"instant national dogma\". The billions of dollars in funding, the economic interests of the bio-technology and pharmaceutical com- panies and the tremendous notoriety from the press which was too much to resist. In wondering why only a handful of scientists questioned the AIDS hypothesis, he cited \"...the conformist pres- sures on scientists, particularly young, untenured scientists, in the age of bio-technology. Their conceptual obedience to the establish- ment maintained by controlled access to grants, journals, and po- Sitions, and rewarded by meeting engagements, personal prizes, consultantships, stocks and co-ownership in companies.\" The National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer In- stitute, the Center for Disease Control, the National Academy of Sciences and the Food and Drug Administration, have all seriously jeopardized their credibility and motives by their active participation or silence in the face of such an obvious fraud. In view of the fact that it is hard to believe that individuals at that level are that stupid (although anything is possible), one must assume that incredible government pressure was brought to bear. The most obvious and usual pressures are funding, perks and the fear of dismissal. Take your choice; incompetence or corruption. Duesberg is a good example of what can happen to one of the most respected scientists in his field. He is world-renowned, an elected member of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, and recipient of the distinguished NIH \"Outstanding Investigator Grant\" (only 23 in the country). He also discovered the genes which cause cancer (oncogenes), and was recommended for a Nobel Prize. He is an international authority on retroviruses, and a Professor of Molecular Biology at the University of California, 8 Berkeley, CA. It is rumored that his $350,000 research grant was to be terminated last year, and his appeal is to be judged by a committee that includes Gallo's mistress, Dr. Flossie Wong Staal; and Dr. Dani Bolognesi, now a wealthy patent holder on HIV tests. These individuals have the ability to rob us of great talent. Intimidation has been unrelenting and vicious. Duesberg wrote that he had been \"...labeled a bigot for considering (the) daily administration of psychoactive and immunosuppressive chemicals more likely to be the cause of AIDS than achronically dormant and almost chemically undetectable retrovirus. The nation's leading AIDS researcher accused me of being an advocate of promiscuity (to paraphrase it politely) for questioning the viral etiology of AIDS.\" Could it be that our scientists were more interested in fostering Puritan values than in presenting scientific truth? The facts will speak for themselves. Instead of answering the sea of questions that shook the very foundations of the AIDS hypothesis, the vested establishment in- sulted their opponents, barred debate, and even cancelled a White House meeting, refusing to participate in order to demonstrate the \"insanity\" of even questioning HIV and AIDS. Their criminal arrogance is an affront to all of humanity. Initially, Gallo and his co-conspirators could have possibly been exonerated on the basis of ignorance and stupidity. However, to block open scientific dis- cussion, to use political and economic power to silence opposing points of view, and to suppress or ignore basic scientific fact and logic, is irrefutable evidence of their criminal intent. 2B OB OB OK 2K 2 8 OB OR OK OK OK 2K RR OK OK OK OK RB OB OK OK KK KR \"To be pious while blaspheming another is merely a reflection of one's own character.\" \u2014 REW 26 2 2 2 2 OR 2 oR OK OK Rg OK OR BR OR OB OB OK BR BK OR OB OK OK BK Although an impressive cadre of well-known scientists has formed the \"Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis\", which was started by Dr. Charles A.

Chapter 2 The Supposed Evidence SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT HIV CAUSES AIDS \"I feel that for scientists to remain silent in the face of all this doubt is tantamount to criminal negligence.\" Dr. Charles A. Thomas, Jr., Harvard Molecular Biologist Definition of terms: Fact: that which is proven and known to be true. Hypothesis: a proposition, mere assumption or guess. NOTE: Comments are made with each hypothesis, but are more fully developed in other sections of this book. * FACT: The only evidence used to establish the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) as the cause of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is based on finding the virus in a small number of AIDS patients. Comment: The AIDS hypothesis was based on the fact that only 40% of the AIDS cases were confirmed by the Center for Disease Control to have antibodies 11 DEADL Y DECEPTION * Hypothesis: Comment: to HIV. This is not proof of anything other than the fact that we have been exposed to a virus and are immune to it. Remember, the presence of flies in garbage does not prove the flies cause the gar- bage. HIV is the first organism, in the past 100 years, to be named as the cause of a disease with- out meeting the accepted scientific standards of proof (Koch's Postulates), but more of this later. We have anti-bodies to many microorganisms which we know to exist in 70% to 90% of the AIDS patients. Epstein-Barr virus and Pneumo- cystis carnii are just two of them. In fact, the Pneumocystis carnii organisms are present in the lungs of all human beings, including AIDS vic- tims; yet no claim is made that they cause AIDS. It is possible, but relatively rare for these diseases to become reactivated. This usually occurs only when an individual becomes debilitated or immunocompromised, and it has never required the assistance of HIV before. Not one shred of scientific proof of cause and effect exists in the world's research and medical literature with reference to HIV. There are currently well over 40 theories (more hypotheses!) to explain the HYPOTHESIS of AIDS, but not one single proven fact. AIDS is a new disease. AIDS is not a new disease. It is 25 very old diseases that have been lumped together under a new name. AIDS is described as an immune defi- ciency which has as its main feature a marked loss of T-cells, a special type of lymphocytes (white blood cells). It is claimed that HIV is responsible for the destruction of the T-cells. This has never actually been observed. When this supposedly occurs, it is believed that the virus somehow works as a \"co-factor\" with other risk factors to cause these diseases, and they are then referred to as 12 * Hypothesis: Comment: * Hypothesis: AIDS diseases. The naming of the disease, its cause, and the requirements to qualify as a disease of AIDS, has been by arbitrary definition; not by the scientific proof which is the standard require- ment in medicine. Unbelievably, it includes three distinctly different classes of diseases which actu- ally represent totally different phenomena. We are asked to believe that the virus causes degenerative disease (dementia), cellulytic disease, which kills cells (infections); and neoplastic disease, which causes cells to multiply faster (tumors). Nothing like this occurs anywhere else in medicine, and the three processes are actually unrelated. Not only do these diseases represent opposing pro- cesses, they all differ widely from each other, and most have their own recognized and established causes. There is no evidence that qualifies as sci- entific proof of cause and effect between the HIV virus and what is referred to as AIDS. The only evidence that has been presented has historically been referred to as \"anecdotal\" (coincidental, sus- picious, or one or more similar cases) until it is proven otherwise by scientific proof.

If it does multiply to the point where it blows up the cell, then it should be easy to find all these cells that are just packed with viruses!

P-24 Antigen is produced at a higher level in AIDS than in HIV disease [asymptomatic carriers]. 14 Comment: * Hypothesis: Comment: * Hypothesis: Comment: Absolutely untrue. Every study has shown that AIDS cases occur without P-24 antigen and P- 24 antigen occurs where there is no AIDS. ee ee ea HIV disease (asymptomatic) will become AIDS (symptomatic) in from 2 to 30 years (this is called the latent period). It has been \"corrected\" con- stantly upward, and a latent period of 45 years has recently been proposed. When they extend it to 75 years (human life expectancy), then it could be said the entire earth's population is dying of AIDS! There is not one shred of proof for this claim. It is pure speculation and it would take as many as 30 years to find out. By that time the perpetrators of this fraud will be long gone. Actually, the annual conversion rate of 1.5% corresponds to a latent period of 67 years. This is not only preposterous and without precedent, but totally meaningless until there is scientific evidence that the virus is the cause. Who worries about a disease that might kill you in 67 years? 2B OK 2K OK OB 2B OK OK OB OB OK OK OR ROKK HIV is deadly, it causes AIDS by killing millions of T-cells (cytocidal) and eventually kills its vic- tims by destroying their immune defenses. This is absolutely contrary to the one special char- acteristic learned about retroviruses during the past 20 years of intensive research: Retroviruses do not kill the host cell. 15 DEADL Y DECEPTION The contradictions are several: Li HIV is rarely found in T-cells (1 virus per 10,000 to 1,000,000 cells) and when found it is dormant, sleeping, and not even replicating. Retroviruses, unlike almost all other viruses, do not kill the cells they infect. In fact, they do just the opposite: they cause cells to mul- tiply at a faster rate. It would be suicide for a retrovirus to kill the very cell it relies on to survive. Therefore the hypothesis which states that the virus disintegrates the cell is in direct contradiction to the facts. Actually, certain lines of T-cells continue to propagate while infected and if antibody is not added to the culture they will produce millions of viruses. This obviously cannot occur in AIDS patients, because they have HIV antibodies. They are therefore already immune and the HIV is neutralized.

In the case of latent viruses such as herpes, when the virus is reactivated by other infections or a debilitated state, the virus is found in sufficient numbers to be called infection.

This technique makes it possible for a scientist to find virus particles that could not be detected before, and literally makes it impossible for viruses to hide. In spite of this, they still can only rarely find this mysterious , unknowable, inexplicable, very slow, incredibly strange, all powerful and singular retrovirus that is going to destroy mankind \u2014 HIV!

This does occur with viruses like herpes, infec- tious mononucleosis, the cytomegalovirus and a few others. When they are activated, they are eas- ily recovered in large numbers. However, this is not true when AIDS occurs, because the virus is almost impossible to find. If HIV is supposed to be destroying T-cells, that is where it should be found \u2014 but it is not there, it is nowhere. In every infectious disease known, the causative organism is always found in significant numbers to account for the disease, especially in the areas where the disease is occurring. This is the first disease in which a virus, \u2014 completely outnumbered by T-cells, totally inadequate in number, almost nonexistent, inactive, non-replicating, non-cell killing, and which induces immunity, \u2014 is sup- posed to be annihilating the victim. 2B EK AB OB OK 8 6 OK OK 8 OK OK OB OK OK ROK 18 * Hypothesis: Comment: * Hypothesis: Comment: HIV is referred to as a \"slow\" or \"lente\" virus because it takes an average of eight years for the disease to appear after the individual became in- fected. Actually, the latent period is now claimed to be as long as 40 or even 65 years. \"Slow\" or \"lente\" viruses do not exist! It is a another hypothetical invention designed to explain what is obviously nonsense. It has no basis in fact, no precedent in science, and is contradictory to 20 years of research findings. Retroviruses can only be replicated by the host cell, and are dependent on the life-cycle of that cell. Therefore, the virus must replicate within hours or days in order to survive. For over 20 years, an exhaustive investi- gation of retroviruses reveals that there is no such thing as a \"slow virus\". There is nothing bio- chemically or genetically different about HIV that could account for this. As Dr. Duesberg puts it, \"There are no slow viruses, only slow virolo- gists.\" Once again, another \"hypothesis\" appears in order to explain yet another inconsistency. It is always speculation in place of proof. It is univer- sally recognized that certain risk behaviors in- crease the likelihood of certain diseases to appear: Smoking with lung diseases, diet with cancer, chemicals and radiation with cancer, and now, drugs with AIDS!

There is absolutely no evidence to support that statement. Studies indicate that it would take 500 to 1000 unprotected sexual encounters to transmit the virus. However, remember that being HIV- positive means that you are immune to an inno- cent virus just like dozens of other viruses that humans carry. A study of 80 HIV carriers and their mates revealed that after hundreds of sexual relationships, only 12 of the mates became HIV- positive. None of them have developed AIDS. The incidence of AIDS correlates very convinc- ingly (95%) with the use of drugs, not with sexual behavior or contacts. The incidence of AIDS indicates that it is very difficult to acquire. It occurs in very select groups, which is why it gained notice in the first place. It came to promi- nence primarily amongst gay males, who became highly \"visible\" when they \"came out of the closet\" around 1980. Subsequently, we became aware of the syndrome in drug users and hemophiliacs. A careful examination of the statistics reveal that the 10% of the gay population that got AIDS, were almost exclusively drug users (>95%) and you must include AZT. The most common denomi- nator in AIDS is drugs.

We know for a fact that prolonged use of, or exposure to, any immune suppressive drug, chemical or radiation will cause susceptibility to many diseases. HIV isn't even necessary.

Yet, not one single reference paper exists in the peer review literature or in any literature proving that HIV causes AIDS. In other words, no experimental proof whatsoever has been offered to establish that the retrovirus, which cannot even be found in more than 50% of the individuals with AIDS, has anything at all to do with the phenomenon that came to our attention in 1980. All that has been offered is far-less-than- coincidental evidence. The only scientific evidence that exists with reference to HIV causing disease, is that it induces a mononucleosis-like disease within 2 to 8 weeks after infection, induces immunity and then does nothing else even in immune suppressed indi- viduals. With incredibly sensitive techniques that have been recently developed, a very minute amount of viral activity can be detected biochemically (which is a million times less than what is necessary to cause disease). Still the virus cannot be detected in more than 50% of the AIDS cases. To propose that so few viruses could be responsible for disease, let alone death, is an absurdity not even worthy of an idiot! It is the ridicu- lous equivalent of saying; \"The presence of flies in garbage proves (that) flies cause the garbage!\" This is the caliber of scientists supported by our tax dollars! Let's demand a refund! 7B AR 2B 2 8 OK 2K OK OK OK 8 OK BOB OK OK OK HIV (the AIDS virus) does not meet Koch's Postu- lates which, for over 100 years, has been the standard \"acid test\" of the kind of evidence required to establish the etiologic (cause and effect) relationship of a given microorganism to a given disease. The conditions in- cluded are: (1) the microorganism must be observed in every case of the disease; 24 (2) it must be isolated and grown in pure culture; (3) the pure culture must, when inoculated into a susceptible animal, reproduce the disease; (4) the microorganism must be observed in and recovered from, the experimentally diseased animal.\" (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictio- nary) The first postulate above originally included \"...and in the time-course of the disease.\" (Duesberg), referring to finding the microorganism in the body's secretions and parts that were indicated by the signs and symp- toms during the progress of the disease. This appears to have been shortened by simple usage rather than any official proclamation. It is still standard procedure to look, for example, in the lungs for the microorganism(s), when the patient presents with cough, shortness of breath, sputum production, etc. In the case of AIDS: 1. HIV is not found in every case of the disease, and it is not found in the time-course of the disease. When it is found, it is in such small numbers it cannot be considered to be clinically significant or relevant. Until Dr. Gallo came along with his scam, it would have been regarded as an artifact or con- taminant. 2. HIV can be cultured in the laboratory in human lymphocytes, the very cells that HIV is supposed to \"explode\". However, it is accomplished with great difficulty by reactivation of dormant proviruses that can be found in only one out of a million lymphocytes. This will occur only in cultures to which at least ten million cells are added, and which are free of the antibody that would other- 25 DEADLY DECEPTION wise neutralize it and stop the culture (as happens naturally in humans). This can be done with only 40 to 50% of the AIDS cases because in the re- mainder you can't even locate one virus. Doesn't sound like a deadly organism to me. . AIDS cannot be reproduced even by injecting large concentrations (millions of times more than is usually needed to cause infection) of pure virus into any laboratory animal, including the chimpanzee which becomes HIV-positive like its human cousins, thus indicating it had been infected by the virus and developed antibodies but no disease. Not one single case of AIDS has occurred. In essence, the third postulate is ful- filled, because the animal gets a mild disease which mostly goes unnoticed; but it is not AIDS BE- CAUSE MONKEYS DON'T TAKE DRUGS! This, of course, is exactly what happens in the human, unless you want to believe in Gallo's fairy tales. After all, A virus that causes nothing, trans- mits nothing.

In Zaire and most of Africa, AIDS has three symptoms, i.e. fever, wasting and diarrhea. This is impossible, if they are supposed to be caused by one or two similar viruses. All other known viral diseases (measles, mumps, chicken pox etc.) are the same in all countries. Every physician knows that there are two rampant problems that exist in Zaire which are characterized by those three symp- toms, i.e. starvation and parasitic disease. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, a co- hort and supporter of Gallo, published a paper in 1985, in which he stated that the world's number one cause of T-cell depletion was malnutrition.

However, they have probably had very little effect on sexual be- havior except for encouraging and increasing the use of condoms. The use of condoms amongst those whose life-style includes mul- tiple sexual contacts, has been beneficial in curtailing the sexually transmitted diseases such as \"nonspecific urethritis, trichomoniasis, chlamydial infections, gonorrhea, edi- tion, 1987). However, it will not have any effect on the \"'spread\"' of AIDS. This will become obvious from the evidence presented. The claims made with reference to AIDS being contagious and spreading are not valid, inconsistent with the facts, without 45 DEADLY DECEPTION proof, prejudicial and intentionally distorted. Therefore, this subject will be discussed, reviewed and analyzed from several aspects in order to arrive at a rational, verifiable and truthful conclusion. The factual evidence supporting the sexual transmis- sion of AIDS is non-existent. What evidence there is in the litera- ture, would normally lead any knowledgeable, unbiased scientific investigator to the inevitable conclusion that: HIV is extremely difficult to transmit sexually, and under those conditions, an epidemic would be impossible! But it doesn't make any difference because: HIV does not cause AIDS Therefore, AIDS does not spread! OK OK 2 OK 8 KOK OK OR 8 OK OK OK RK OK WHERE'S THE VIRUS? * FACT: A study by Dr. Robert Gallo himself, the usurper of the AIDS virus from France, and retrovirologist with the National Cancer Institute, claimed he found HIV in the semen of just two AIDS patients, but neglected to state how many patients' semen he had to search through in order to find those two. He didn't even document how many viruses he found per million sperm. This lack of information doesn't meet the standards of a scientific paper, and in fact, bespeaks of a rank amateur or a fraud. It is incredible that this kind of garbage was given any attention at all. In fact, a review of the literature is remarkable for the absence of supporting pertinent data, which is usually mandated in most sci- entific research articles. If Dr. Gallo had found any other organism in the sperm of an AIDS sufferer, would he have pronounced it the cause of the disease? Not on your life! Those tests are either unpatentable or already owned by someone else.

This is hardly convincing evidence that there is anything other than the possibility that it may be a \"marker\" rather than the cause. In other words, the presence of the virus, which they call HIV, could indi- cate that someone who is already immune deficient could be vulnerable to it and therefore succumb to infection. However, because HIV is so harmless, even someone with immune deficiency can form antibodies to defeat it. 28 OB OK 2 8 8 OK OK 2 OR OK OK OR OE OK OK Other studies have shown the presence of the virus in the semen to be as little as 8% and as high as 30%.

In the study which indicated the inci- dence of 30%, there was only one virus per million sperm, which is absolutely not sufficient to spread an infection (Extracted from an interview by Celia Farber with Dr. Robert Root-Bernstein, Professor of Physiol- ogy, Michigan State University, and presented in her outstanding article \"Fatal Distraction\", SPIN maga- zine, June 1992). 28K 8 KK OR OK OB OB OK OB OK OB OB OK RK 'The NIH lied, when they claimed that in one study, reported in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes in 1992, that HIV was found in the semen in all of the 28 subjects studied.

The average number of specimens taken was 2.4 per patient. This could indicate that as little as one, or as many as 3, 4 or more could have come from each patient. This kind of re- porting is sloppy, misleading, and not atypical of the entire AIDS fraud and the caliber of research relied upon. In addition, while there were 3 specimens from 3 patients with AIDS, only 1 out of the 3 (33%) was HIV positive. It is interesting that the incident presence of HIV was the same in both asymptomatic and AIDS patients. Statistically this renders the study as totally meaningless in support of the AIDS hypothesis. This report actually indicates that HIV is a coincidental worthless finding. This is unheard of in the history of disease! Certainly, one would expect that the active disease would demand an increase in the presence of greater numbers of the virus.

CAUSES, CO-FACTORS OR CONFUSION? * FACT: * FACT: A research team led by Dr. Gerald Friedland of the Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, re- ported that individuals dying from AIDS were mostly homosexuals who were I.V. drug users (New En- gland Journal of Medicine, February 6, 1986). Is it homosexual sex, the drug abuse or both? This is the key question! The answer is obvious and would be known if honesty was the policy of the medical estab- lishment, the Centers for Disease Control and the rest of the governmental agencies involved in this scam. AIDS by all reports can almost exclusively be found in a subset of the homosexual population \u2014 the drug users. The statistics clearly point to drugs, rather than sex, as the cause. After all, the incidence of AIDS in non-homosexual drug users is notoriously high. Health problems caused by abuse cannot be transmitted sexu- ally. Besides, when was the last time you heard of alcoholism and the liver and brain damage it causes, being transmitted by sex?

The immune properties of sperm logi- cally protects the sperm from antagonistic reactions, and plays a role in protecting the union of the sperm with an ovum. Research during the past four decades indicates that between 10 and 15% of the heterosexual population in the U.S. engages in anal intercourse (Masters and Johnson). If sperm in the rectum is a \"co- factor\" in AIDS, where is the epidemic in that group? Any conjecture about female resistance is pure specu- lation with no scientific evidence. ee Celia Farber, noted writer and investigator on AIDS, in her classic article \"Fatal Distraction\" (SPIN, June 1992) wrote that the media uses singular examples of un- proven heterosexual transmission, instances designed to \"...favor the dramatic, terror ridden, Russian rou- lette model\" using cases \"in which people swear they' ve gotten AIDS from a single sexual act\" (this is typical of the idiotic \"scientific\" supporting evidential non- sense that is quoted). She then points to the episode of Alison Gertz, who claimed that she got AIDS from a man she slept with on one occasion. (Alison made the statement and without proof or evidence it is accepted as true \u2014 she must have felt the virus enter her va- gina.) \"Suddenly, the media were making a tremen- dous deal out of what is in reality a very rare example, while insisting that cases like it were the wave of the 53 DEADLY DECEPTION future.\" A vitally important fact to remember, is that when you hear or read of one case (out of the millions who are supposedly HIV-positive) who claimed they had gotten AIDS from a man they slept with once, that is less than circumstantial evidence of transmission. It is illogical, arbitrary, deceptive and irresponsible on the part of the press to sensationalize the one unproven exception, when there are thousands of cases which do not support that example. Why? Because: 1. The person could be a drug-user and obviously not wish to confess it. 2. The individual could have developed any one of the 25 diseases under the AIDS umbrella just as other millions have for centuries before. 3. Immune deficiencies can occur from hundreds of causes (Merck Manual, the physician's \"bible\"; the long list includes radiation, chemotherapy, steroids, antibiotics, genetic problems, drugs, and many other medications, transfusions, etc.). 4. Hasty conclusions, based on one case or one hun- dred cases of what could be coincidental or due to so many other causes, in the absence of scientific proof, does not prove anything. We only have to look at recent medical-political history to realize the cost in human life and money when we are panicked into leaping before we look. The Salk vaccine which caused many deaths and was quickly withdrawn (Salk is still looked upon as a hero!), and the \"swine flu\" fiasco, are but just two ex- amples. 5.

Between \"poppers\" and AZT, neither of which were even mentioned. You have two proven causes of immune deficiency. They certainly could account for the 24% reported as diagnosed \"with- out etiology\". QUIZ: Considering the percentages, which of the above, would a rational person say, is the most likely cause of AIDS? A, B,C, D; EorF ? What I'm getting at here is that there are many causes of AIDS and that the virus would be the least likely candidate, even as a co- factor. John Lauritsen and Hank Wilson in their well-researched book Poppers and AIDS (Pagan Press, 1986), convincingly build a strong case incriminating nitrites as a cause of AIDS. But they also muddied the waters by passing on the same old hysterical, mislead- ing information by inserting the unfounded \"safe sex\" recommen- dation without presenting the same excellent scientific basis for their admonition that they presented on behalf of nitrites as cause of AIDS. This is their misleading suggestion: 55 DEADLY DECEPTION \"In light of what is known now, gay men should continue to follow 'safe sex' guidelines. In conservative terms, this would mean either practicing celibacy or limiting sex to simple body contact and mutual masturbation. The simple rule for safe sex is: > 99 'On me, not in me'.\" \u2014 Give me a break! What was known then, and what is known nov, is that sex is not only the least likely way that someone can get AIDS. It is not even possible! What is being reported is the DEADLY DE- CEPTION. Certainly, safe sex should be practiced to prevent venereal diseases (and pregnancy in women), but it won't prevent AIDS. So much for the absurdity about contagion and sex as the cause or transmission of AIDS. Let's look further: WHY PICK ON SEX? \"Sex, the procreator of life and unequalled joy, is perennially the tyrant's ultimate weapon to subdue, coerce, threaten, instill fear and control.\" \u2014 REW The answer to a question is often best understood when you exam- ine the event and the results it achieves. Let us examine the effects of the \"AIDS epidemic\". A. Most, if not all of the retrovirologists involved are now multi-millionaires. B. Gallo, who is now wealthy, has also become famous and powerful. He has finally gained the recognition he had tried so hard to attain, but which he had failed to achieve for so many years through other bogus scientific claims that were rejected in the past. C. The Government got \"off the hook\" and pressure was re- lieved when the announcement was made that the cause of AIDS had been discovered. 56 D. The departments of government involved with AIDS gained more money and power. E. Pharmaceutical companies (particularly Burroughs-Wel- come, the manufacturer of AZT), research laboratories, medical supply companies, condom and rubber (or plastic) glove manufacturers and countless more, have profited immensely from this megabillion dollar fraud. John Q. Public is paying for it all, on a disease whose cause is misrepresented, and in pursuit of a vaccine and drug therapy to treat a virus that hasn't done anything! F. Over 16,000 AIDS organizations have been established. Though I am sure most have good intentions, vested inter- ests are formed, jobs are created and a power base is formed. \"When AIDS was taken on by the media and by AIDS organizations, it was endowed instantly with a set of politi- cal, social, and moral implications, and an extraordinary righteousness set in, a fervor so sure of itself that it refused to tolerate any questions\" (Farber). G. It has placed a \"pall of fear' on pre-marital sex and on variety in sexual expression. H. It has given the fundamentalists in religion the opportunity to use it as an example of God's wrath and punishment on fornicators and sodomists (primarily male homosexuals). They fail to explain the almost complete absence of AIDS in lesbians. I guess God either approves of female homo- sexuality or selectively forgives women and not men. Les- bians don't seem to be effected by AIDS \u2014 unless they use drugs, of course. I. It started an upsurge in gay-bashing and took steam out of the gay rights movement. J. Haitian and African immigration was curtailed and even political refugees have been turned away. With this plethora of individuals, corporations, and govern- mental agencies that have such incredible economic and political 57 DEADLY DECEPTION power at stake, is it no wonder that the truth has been silenced and ignored. Many courageous scientists and physicians who have dared to speak up have lost jobs, grants and licences, while the perpetrators have prospered. However, the greatest crime of all is that research is going in the wrong direction. We are ignoring over 20 years of expensive time and effort that proved that retroviruses were harmless to humans, and are leaving hundreds of thousands of suffering and dying human beings at the mercy of a \"killer drug\" (AZT), with no hope of salvation. Now, if you wanted to sell anything to the public, even a fraud, what subject would gain the most attention, interest and notoriety? SEX, of course! How diabolically cruel, calloused and insensitive it is for the medical profession and the government to perpetuate unfounded lies that attempt to: 1. Impress homosexuals that their sexual preference and behavior is the reason that they become victims of a deadly disease and therefore homosexuality is wrong and unnatural; 2. Frighten the public into believing that \"traditional family values', particularly marital sex, are the only defense against AIDS; 3. Divert attention away from one of the most obvious causes \u2014 illegal immune suppressive drugs \u2014 and thus deprive the \"war on drugs\" of its most powerful weapon, i.e. in- forming the world that it is not the needles, it is the drugs that cause AIDS! 4. Hide from the world the fact that many medicines (par- ticularly AZT), chemotherapy, radiation, our usual diet, and the chemical and biological pollution of our food, air and water, are the true causes of almost all immune deficiencies, chronic illnesses and cancer. 58 Chapter 6 Then, What Causes AIDS? \"\\.J tried to show that HTLV-1 was not involved in AIDS, all the journals refused to publish it.\" Dr. Joseph Sonnabend, Founder, AIDS Medical Foundation In this section we will explore the known causes of the major diseases of AIDS, especially those that make obvious the reasons why they have occurred mainly in the male homosexual, drug user and hemophiliac subgroups of world. FACT: There is no scientific evidence that HIV (the so-called AIDS virus) causes AIDS. There are a large number of reference papers which already have established the many causes of immune deficiency and specifically many of the individual diseases that have been lumped under the AIDS label. In fact, all diseases occur almost exclusively in individuals who are immuno-compromised to one degree or another. If this were not true, any deadly epidemic would have put an end to the human race long ago! It is ironic that \"the blind sheep\" of the medical profession, in the matter of AIDS have accepted the presence of immunity as the cause of a disease. It is more than ironic, it is frightening. 59 DEADLY DECEPTION So far, the perpetrators of this fraud ask us to believe that HIV: * Causes 25 diseases in the United States and Europe. * Causes only 3 symptoms in Africa. * Prefers men over women 9 to 1 in the United States and Europe. * Prefers men and women equally in Africa. * Prefers gay men in the United States. * Prefers heterosexuals in Africa. * Targets the young adult population. * Ignores the old, handicapped and infirmed. * Is less virulent in the poorest unsanitary nations. * Only causes disease when undetectable, not present at all or in insufficient numbers. * Never appears in clinically significant amounts. * Is such a slow virus that it will take 25,000 years to kill the victims currently infected in Zaire. * Destroys its only means of replication and survival. * Conquers by committing suicide. * (This \"deadly virus\") actually prolongs the life of hemo- philiacs who receive transfusions that contain it (More died in one year after receiving non-infected transfusions than those who received infected blood). * Is different from all other retroviruses though there is no genetic evidence of said differences. 60 IN ADDITION: The perpetrators of this fraud also insist that we change defi- nitions, rules and scientific requirements, such as: * Tt is not necessary to meet the accepted rules of proof, Koch's Postulates, which have stood the test of 100 years of verification. * Theory backed by theory is equal to fact. * The presence of flies on garbage proves the flies caused the garbage. 2 2 26 26 2 2K 2K 2 2K OK OK OB OB OK OK RK One might accept HIV as the cause of AIDS if there was at least a semblance of proof that it was true. However, in this instance, we are asked to believe in pure fantasy. In truth, this is the most outrageous and deadly example of Hitler's big lie! In response to the brilliant arguments and facts presented by Dr. Peter Deusberg (of whom Dr. Gallo himself referred to as knowing \"more about retroviruses than any man alive'), Gallo responded that Deusberg's claims were \"too ridiculous to waste time answering!\" This is an example of the kind of quality, respon- sibility and intelligence of the rebuttal from the man in charge of the largest AIDS research laboratory in the world, to a brilliant, world-renowned colleague. This has been the standard pattern that Gallo has used to avoid exposure of his gigantic fraud. Gallo, in the powerful position of controlling most of the research is literally the \"fox guarding the hen-house\"'. When in the history of modern scientific research have we ever accepted hypotheses (assumptions) as fact? When have the many discrepancies of the hypothetical been explained by more hypoth- eses, whose discrepancies in turn are explained by more hypoth- eses resulting in a never ending chain of insanity? None of these hypotheses have ever been proven by laboratory or even anec- dotal evidence! AIDS represents placing many different diseases under one heading, and steadily adding to that list to make it appear as though 61 DEADLY DECEPTION the \"epidemic\" is spreading (even with this tactic the predicted \"epidemic\" is lagging more than 90%). In Africa, where it is estimated that 40 million people are HIV-positive, AIDS is de- fined as diarrhea, fever and wasting. These are the symptoms of malnutrition, starvation, toxic pollution and parasitic disease, which are rampant in the populations cited. Yet, there are no studies to indicate that the presence of antibodies to HIV poses a greater risk to the patient. (The curing of AIDS by diet is being reported in Africa \u2014 it has already been reported in the U.S.A., Australia and elsewhere). Respected eyewitness reports and various top African government health officials revealed in 1993 that there isno AIDS epidemic in Africa! KNOWN CAUSES OF AIDS \"T ask you, what kind of scientist continues to support a hypothesis that fails to explain and fails to predict?\" Harvey Bialy, Editor, Bio/Technology THE AMYL NITRITE (\"POPPERS\") CONNECTION * FACT: Many documented studies have demonstrated that be- tween 96% to 100% of AIDS cases were users of \"poppers\" (amyl nitrite, a medication for cardiacs, that was popular with male homosexuals to enhance the sexual climax). Compare this with the fact that only 40% of the AIDS cases showed evidence of having HIV. Which is more likely the cause? It is important to pause here and dwell on the overwhelming evidence of the amy] nitrite-AIDS connection. The proof of cause and effect is undeniable, and yet, it has been largely ignored and suppressed in dissemination to the profession and the media. The documentation reference to amy] nitrite that I will present is but a fraction of the evidence available. It is representative of the evi- dence available for the indictment of the many causes of AIDS that has been in the medical literature for decades. Considering that it was by decree and not scientific evidence that HIV is called the cause of AIDS, you will be appalled, shocked and angered at the magnitude of the deception. Many of the investigators involved in 62 the articles cited, linked viral infection to the use of \"poppers\" as the \"postulated\" cause of the AIDS diseases. This linking is with- out foundation in the absence of proper controls. It is the shoddiest of \"scientific\" conclusion or postulation. The use of \"poppers\" by the drug-using subgroup of the gay population explains why Kaposi's sarcoma is almost exclusively occurring in that cluster. 2K 2K 2K 2K 8 28 OK OK 2 OK ok OK OR OK OK OK * Annals of internal medicine, August 1983 In an epidemiological study involving the first 50 AIDS pa- tients, Harold W.

Sadly, the controls in this study, did not exclude drug-users and individuals who had typical immune deficient abnormalities and some of these individuals subsequently developed AIDS. I believe that this would further illustrate that the types of drugs or combination of drugs determine the type of disease that develops. * Tancet, May 12, 1984 A 30-month study by Usha Mathur-Wagh et al, followed 42 men (bisexual and homosexual) with persistent lymphadenopathy (swollen glands). All of the subjects had inhaled nitrites and many had used recreational drugs (none had used drugs intravenously). Eight subjects developed AIDS during the course of the study. All eight had used nitrite inhalants heavily. The authors reported a follow-up study after 4 1/2 years in the New England Journal of Medicine on December 12, 1985. They reported that 12 subjects had by that time developed AIDS \u2014 all of whom were nitrite users.

Durack, in the lead editorial, discusses why AIDS is apparently new and sees \"recreational drugs\" as one possibility. He points out that \"'...the only patients in the series reported in this issue who were not homosexual were drug users ... Perhaps one or more of these recreational drugs is an immunosuppressive agent. The leading candidates are the nitrites, which are now commonly inhaled to intensify orgasm...\" Unfortunately, Durack compro- mised his integrity by adding the next sentence which introduces two co-factors without any basis in fact: \"Let us postulate that the combined effects of persistent viral infection plus an adjuvant drug cause immuno-suppression in some genetically predisposed men\" (emphasis mine). Durack, in inferring that three things may be necessary for AIDS, ignores what has been factually known about most drugs for decades. He makes them secondary and then throws in genetics, which is truly immaterial. Obviously, genetic disease can well stand on its own and is relatively rare. Can you imagine a genetic epidemic? He therefore places the virus infection as primary, even when active infection has never been demonstrated. It must have come to him in a vision, because he certainly grabbed it out of the thin \u2014 the very thin \u2014 hot air! I suspect that if he didn't report in this manner, he wouldn't receive any more grants! I would prefer the company and honesty of street prosti- tutes over Durack, at least they admit what they are, and they certainly don't mislead their colleagues or their clients. Perhaps Dr. Durack and the rest of the non-thinking members of the scientific community can explain the existence of the follow- ing documented realities presented in major journals and at major seminars in 1992: 64 A growing number of AIDS cases are being reported in which: I. The presence of HIV, or even the antibodies to HIV, has not been demonstrated. If. Individuals, particularly children, have no known \"risk factors\", i.e., Drug use, injections, transfusions, born of parents with AIDS, sexually active or promiscuous, or \"gay\". Il. 5% of the population of the U.S.A., or approximately 12,500,000 Americans are purported to be HIV-positive and yet, the number of aids cases is proportionately dropping. IV. All estimates, by the major health organizations of the world, indicate that the overwhelming majority of HIV infected people are not developing AIDS. (Of course, we may have to wait 45 to 65 years to find out). V. There are the extremely important and crucial studies analyzing and correlating the number of individuals who died from the AIDS diseases in the many decades prior to this \"new epidemic\" \u2014 there is no epidemic! In the Journal of Toxicology-Clinical Toxicology, 1983, Rich- ard F. Jacobs, et al., commit the same serious commission of unwarranted, unfounded and misleading statements when in their article they wrote, \"Functional deficits in lymphocyte interaction following occasional or chronic exposure to inhaled nitrites may be a potential contributing but not the [primary] factor in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [emphasis article, \"Cellular Immunotoxicity of Amy] Nitrite\", described \"some effect on all cellular functions was demonstrated\" in as little as 5 minutes exposure to amyl nitrite vapors. The effects noted were significant, extensive and numerous, prompting them to com- ment, \"These effects may be a potential factor in the alterations of phenotypic markers on T-lymphocyte populations, as well as, a 65 DEADLY DECEPTION potential contributing factor in the functional deficit of mono- nuclear cells in patients with AIDS.\" I have no problem with the frequent use of the word \"potential\" because it is good cautious terminology. However, the definitive statement, that it is not the primary cause of AIDS, is irresponsible and not supported by any evidence. Oh well, he's probably gotten his next grant! 2B OK 2 2K 2 2K 2 OK OOK OR OB OK OB OK ROR Michael Marmor et al, in the Lancet, May 15, 1982, published the kind of objective research article that is rare when it comes to AIDS. He and his co-workers. were candid and straightforward, with one exception (highlighted) in their hypothesis; \"Use of amyl nitrite may have caused Kaposi's by directly causing immunosuppression, thereby allowing expres- sion of a sexually transmitted oncogenic virus; or by allowing an unknown carcinogenic agent, otherwise controlled by the immune system, to operate; or by acting as a direct or metabolically acti- vated carcinogen.\" I would suspect that Marmor relied on the integrity of his colleagues and went with the flow, rather than look for evidence of sexual transmission himself or even conducting a search for at least one reference paper incriminating a virus. But again, throwing in \"little men from outer space', enables scientists to get their papers financed and published. You can do honest research, but unless you link it to HIV and AIDS with the equivalent of a \"perhaps\", it's no dice \u2014 uh, no money that is! REVERSAL OF THE T-CELL RATIO, a signature charac- teristic of the immune defect in AIDS, has been cited by many respected researchers as a common, if not a constant, finding in individuals who use nitrite inhalants. This has been reported in some of the most renowned medical journals, such as the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. Many studies on cells in the laboratory (in vitro), in mice and in humans, (Lynch, Gerblich, Ortiz, Maickel, Newell, Goedert, Moss and others) 66 have clearly demonstrated this in the absence of genetic or viral co-factors. It has been likewise demonstrated in humans in the absence of any other co-factors. There are no such comparable studies available with reference to the so-called HIV. Not one! HIV has never been demonstrated to cause AIDS or any of the pathological changes seen in AIDS. It is all unsubstantiated fan- tasy, but stated as though it were fact. BK 2B OB OK ROK OK OB OK OB OB OK OK OK KK THE EVIDENCE 1. The toxicity of the inhalant nitrites is so well documented, that many states have outlawed them. 2. The nitrite-immune defect relationship of cause and effect is undeniable. 3. The 96-100% nitrite-AIDS connection is astonishing di- rect evidence. The laboratory and clinical evidence is over- whelming. CONCLUSION Nitrites (particularly inhalant) should be listed as the number one cause of AIDS in the gay population, especially those with Kaposi's sarcoma. It has already been proven. It is not a co-factor, and it doesn't need one. It is fitting to ask why powerful government agencies did not and have not taken note of the obvious nitrite-Kaposi's sarcoma- AIDS connection. The common corrupt tactic of these agencies is to focus on a single misleading article (usually conducted by a government, government sponsored or self-serving industrial re- search group) that is contrary to the wealth of articles by indepen- dent researchers which clearly implicate nitrites as extremely deadly. In this instance, the Centers for Disease Control newsletter in the September 9, 1983 issue, cited a CDC/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Study as indicating that there was no evidence of immunotoxic reactions from amyl nitrite. In- credibly, the study evaluated very low levels of nitrite vapors approximating those found in a factory manufacturing \"poppers\". 67 DEADLY DECEPTION This is in sharp contradistinction to direct inhalation from an ampule or bottle which is significantly higher in concentration. In spite of the fact that the researchers themselves wrote, \"...this study did not attempt to model the recreational use of these drugs...Exposures were selected to mimic an occupational ex- posure in order to fill this gap in the existing literature, rather than to conduct brief acute high-level exposures to imitate expo- sure by nitrite abusers.\"', the CDC purposely misled the scientific community. Worse, the CDC became criminally negligent by not warning the public of the mortal danger inherent in inhal- ing \"poppers\". Incredible! Naturally, the industry used this ar- ticle to indicate that \"poppers\" had been exonerated of deadly accusations. | The shameful lack of action on the part of James W. Curran, M.D., Chief of the AIDS Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, Center for Infectious Diseases, is easily understood when one realizes that as long as the myth of the AIDS virus is kept viable, Curran remains very powerful. He receives tremendous attention from the media, who unsuspectingly repeat his lies and distortions. One can only guess what incredible benefits are derived. Is this ignorance, incompetence, criminal negligence or criminal con- Spiracy to commit genocide? Is this obscene corruption? If so, it must not go unpunished! ee DRUG USE * FACT: 95% of AIDS victims (excluding hemophiliacs) are drug users. It must be recognized, however, that many individuals are reluctant to admit they are on drugs. It is socially and legally unacceptable and holds poten- tially severe condemnation. It is very common to ex- clude \"poppers\" and AZT from the definition of drugs. In view of the fact that only 40%-50% of AIDS victims test positive for having had an HIV infection, it would seem far more logical that drugs cause AIDS.

The public and even the average physician have been denied. the truth. The heinous history of immorality, criminal attitudes and be- havior of the Center for Disease Control continues today. Their abounding ignorance, stifling bureaucracy and cold disregard for the human cost of their actions and, in many cases inaction, can be exemplified historically by the infamous Tuskeegee experiment. Four hundred black men were deliberately left untreated for syphi- lis for a period of forty years (1932 to 1972) to determine the ultimate effects, longevity and complications of the disease. In spite of the fact that this information was already known, the CDC defended the experiment as a \"clinical matter where the decision may not have been correct\" (emphasis mine). 78 7K 2 8 2K 2 8 2K OK 8 2K OK OB OK OK OB OK 70 The world's #1 retrovirologist blows the whistle! DR. PETER DUESBERG ON AIDS \"Truth is not verified by popular vote, it avoids no question and answers without emotion.\" \u2014 REW The conclusion to Dr. Peter Deusberg's brilliant paper pre- sented for publication to the Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences USA, vol. 80, pp. 755-764, February 1989, serves to answer the question of causation better than any I have seen. All emphasis is mine. \"What are the causes of AIDS? I propose that AIDS is not a contagious disease caused by one conventional virus or mi- crobe, because no such virus or microbe would average 8 years to cause a primary disease, or would selectively effect only those who habitually practice risk behavior, or would be able to cause the diverse collection of over 20 degenerative and neo- plastic diseases. Neither could a conventional virus or microbe Survive if it were as inefficiently transmitted as AIDS, and killed its host in the process. Conventional viruses either are highly pathogenic and easy to transmit or are non-pathogenic and latent and hence very difficult to transmit. Conventional viruses or microbes also exist that cause secondary or even primary diseases long after infection, but only when they are activated from dormancy by rare acquired deficiencies of the immune system. Such opportunistic infections are the conse- quence rather than the cause of immunodeficiency. \"Since AIDS is defined by new combinations of conven- tional diseases, it may be caused by new combinations of conventional factors. The habitual administration of factor VIII or blood transfusions or of drugs, chronic promiscu- ous male homosexual activity that is associated with drugs, numerous acute parasitic infections, and chronic malnutri- tion \u2014 each for an average of 8 years \u2014 are factors that appear to provide biochemically more tangible and plau- sible bases for AIDS than an idle retrovirus. Indeed, the correlation between AIDS and such factors is 95%. Among these factors, EBV, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and 71 DEADLY DECEPTION administration of blood components and factor VIII have all been identified as causes of immunodeficiency not only in HIV-positive, but also HIV-negative, hemophiliacs. In fact, the dose of factor VIII received was found to be directly pro- portional to subsequent immunodeficiencies. The habitual admission of narcotic toxins appears to play a major role in the U.S. and Europe. Moreover, that the Kaposi's sarcoma cases decreased exactly with the use of nitrites, rather than lagging behind it by 8 years as would be expected from the presumed 8 year latent period of HIV, argues directly against a role of HIV in Kaposi's sarcoma. About 30% of the American AIDS patients are confirmed users of injected drugs. Because of the difficulties in assessing drug data, it is probable that the per- centage who use injected and/or non-injected drugs is even higher. For example, nine different drugs were used in combi- nation by a cohort of antibody-positive homosexuals in San Francisco. Again there are quantitative drug-AIDS correla- tions. For example, the decreased use of nitrite inhalants was shown to correlate with the decreased incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in homosexuals. 'Further, it has been documented that protein malnu- trition, parasitic infections and (exposure to toxins) are the most common causes of T-cell immunodeficiency world- wide, particularly in developing countries. Unlike HIV, the specifics of these risk factors provide a plausible explanation for the risk specificity of AIDS diseases. The long and unpre- dictable intervals between the appearance of antibody to HIV and the onset of AIDS would the reflect the thresholds for these factors to cause AIDS diseases, rather than an unlikely mecha- nism of HIV pathogenesis. \"In response to this view it is often pointed out that AIDS risks have existed for a long time, whereas AIDS is said to be a new syndrome. However, this argument fails to consider that the major risk groups \u2014 male homosexuals and intravenous drug users \u2014 have only become visible and acceptable in the U.S. and in Europe during the last 10 to 15 years, about the same time that AIDS became visible. Acceptability facilitated and probably enhanced risk behavior, and thus the incidence of the many diseases now called AIDS. Increased consumption of drugs was reported to have increased the number of drug- 72 related deaths, although unconfirmed HIV infections were the preferred interpretation. Moreover, the particular permissive- ness toward these risk groups in metropolitan centers encour- aged the clustering of cases that was necessary to detect AIDS. Further, it has been pointed out that slim disease, fever and diarrhea in Africa are not a new epidemic, but old diseases under a new name, caused by previously known infectious agents and malnutrition. \"This analysis offers several benefits. It ends the fear of infection by HIV, and particularly of immunity to HIV, be- cause it proves that HIV alone is not sufficient to cause AIDS. To determine whether HIV is necessary for AIDS, controlled, randomized analyses either of risk takers who differ only by the presence of antibody to HIV or of antibody-positive individuals who differ only in taking AIDS risks must be carried out. Moreover, assessment of a pathogenic potential of HIV would depend on evidence that the life-span of antibody- positive risk takers is shorter than that of antibody- free controls. In addition, it should be determined whether, prior to 1981, AIDS risk takers ever developed what are now called AIDS diseases. This analysis also suggests studies on how the nature, frequency, and duration of AIDS risks generate risk specific diseases. Such studies should include persons treated with AZT before and after AIDS symptoms to assess the AIDS risks of AZT. To this end, diseases should be reported by their original names, rather than AIDS because of their association with antibody to HIV. Finally, this analysis suggests that AIDS prevention _ efforts be concentrated on AIDS risks rather than on trans- mission of HIV.\" I took the liberty of highlighting several key sentences, as well as separating the last paragraph because of its singular importance. The studies that Dr. Duesberg suggests are so basic and elemen- tary, that any individual or agency that would make scientific claims without them is inexcusable. When Margaret Heckler adopted HIV as the cause of AIDS, basically all institutions which rely on HHS for funding, grants etc., had to go along and cooperate, or face extinction. HHS is the paymaster for all health departments and agencies. This includes the National Institutes of Health. Bureaucracy suppresses freedom 73 DEADLY DECEPTION of thought and expression, so if you want to keep your job, you keep quiet and go along with the flow. Politics not only enters science through this route, but it controls it. There is obviously no conflict of interest rulings involved, so profit and power supersedes truth, and therefore integrity is compromised. In scientific circles and in law it is considered blatant fraud and the perpetrators should be criminally prosecuted for that fraud, as well as for all of its consequences. Risk groups represent 95% of the AIDS cases in the United States. Rather than waste incredible sums on absurd unscientific hypotheses, we should be asking what it is that they are doing that the rest of us are not? Then, if we include all individuals who have the same 25 diseases, but who are HIV-negative, the answer will be very clear! Just as clear as it was when it was first printed in the Merck Manual over 40 years ago and which is even more self- evident today. 74 INTERMISSION A TIME TO REFLECT \u2014 AGAIN As I promised at the beginning, now is the time for you to pause and to ask the first set of questions. The brainwashing for years by the press leave most people with an element of confusion and doubt. It would not be unusual for you to wonder and ask: THEN WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE DYING OF AIDS? If one person dies of any disease, it is too many. I have prefaced my answer with that honest statement so that you will not think that my answer is a casual one. Firstly, that many people are not dying of AIDS. It represents a very small percentage of deaths except in third world countries where starvation is rampant. The predictions for the future are exaggerated to the extreme and have fallen short by significant amounts. The \"epidemic\" had failed to grow for several years, until they added more diseases. You might read that AIDS is the \"lead- ing cause of death\" in a particular age group, which may make it sound as if it is far more widespread than it actually is. It would be expected for AIDS to be the number one killer in the age groups (20's to early 30's) that are heaviest into drugs \u2014 and it is! Infec- tions have never been prevalent in that age group. 1 DEADLY DECEPTION THEN WHY ARE BABIES AND SEXUAL PARTNERS GETTING AIDS? The baby born of an addicted mother will be immune deficient and have all the symptoms of drug addiction, which are identical with ARC (AIDS Related Complex) patients. When you look at a crack cocaine baby, it is identical to the babies of Somalia and the AIDS babies of America. What about Arthur Ashe? This famous tennis star received blood transfusions with sur- gery. The claim was that the virus was transmitted through the blood. This might be true, but the virus has never been shown to cause any disease in humans. Therefore, the most likely causes would be those which have been proven, i.e. the immune suppressives in the blood or even more likely, the use of AZT. Will \"Magic\" Johnson (the basketball superstar) die of AIDS? If he is on drugs (including AZT) - YES! If he is not - NO! How did he become HIV-positive? I, of course, don't know for sure. It could have been from measles or a \"flu\" - but who cares? It doesn't mean a thing! It could be a marker for immune suppression. Without a good medical history, physical examination and laboratory workup, I would only be guessing. What about the cases I read about in the newspapers, in which somebody got it from a dentist or from having sex with an infected person one time? It wouldn't make any difference if you did IT a thousand times. You cannot get AIDS from anyone. Either drugs were involved or the AZT killed them and fulfilled the prophecy. 3K 2K 2 2K 2K oR 2K OK 2 OK OK og OK OK OK KR 76 28 OB OK 2B 8 2K OK OK OR OK OK OR OK OK OK ORK A FRIENDLY REMINDER Immunodeficiency disease is caused by: Malnutrition, environmental toxins, radiation, chemotherapy, transfusions (usually multiple) which contain immunosuppressives, excessive emotional and physical stress, recreational drugs and a great variety and number of prescription drugs!

A large segment of the medical industry will also denounce, oppose, twist and distort the facts in order to protect their pet goose and keep the production of \"golden eggs\" as bountiful as ever. The billions of dollars harvested by government agencies, administrators and pro- moters of funds for the 16,000 AIDS organizations, pharmaceutical companies, technological instrument companies, laboratories, phy- Sicians, and the thousands of health care workers and researchers, will be desperately missed. Is it no wonder that this fraud persists? However, the current research will be as fruitful as fishing for sharks in the dessert.

The drugs which are used to treat AIDS are estab- lished causes of immunodeficiency; antibiotics, ste- roids, and in particular, the only chemotherapy infa- mously approved by the FDA; azidothymidine (AZT), \u2014 which actually causes AIDS (see package insert). \"AZT Is A Random Killer Of Infected And Non- Infected Cells. AZT cannot discriminate among them. It kills T-cells; B-cells; red cells (that carry oxygen) \u2014 it kills all cells. AZT is a chain terminator of DNA synthesis of all cells \u2014 no exceptions. It wipes out everything. In the long run it can only lead to the death of the organism \u2014 and the cemetery. AZT is a certain killer! Who will be held responsible for the death of patients (some 180,000 now being treated with AZT) that results from AZT therapy-pharmacological homicide?\" (quoted from Peter Duesberg's article in the Truth Seeker, Sept./Oct. 1989) Insanity! This in fact, makes up a major part of your deadly epidemic! Can you fully comprehend the hor- rendous meaning of the AZT treatment? Individuals who test HIV-positive, which indicates they have im- munity to a harmless virus, are then given a drug which will cause them to develop the very disease they did not have and then die from it. AZT cannot cure drug addiction or starvation except by killing the patient; and, of course, death cures everything. AZT was sitting on the shelves of the National Insti- tutes of Health in Washington, D.C., after it failed as a cancer drug, because it was too toxic. AZT, was the subject of a double-blind study con- ducted by Margaret Fischl at the Jackson Memorial Hospital, University of Miami Medical Center. A double-blind study is one in which neither the patient nor the doctor knows whether the patient is getting the experimental drug or the placebo (fake). In this way it 80 is impossible for the doctor to influence the outcome of the experiment and the psychological effect of receiv- ing medicine is nullified or equal for both. The placebo is usually an inert powder that has absolutely no dis- cernible effect on the patient. The study by Dr. Fischler was prematurely discontinued after 16 weeks for \"ethi- cal reasons\" because of the greater death rate in the control group. This study, which resulted in AZT being released for use in treating AIDS, was heavily flawed and fraudulent because: 1. AZT is highly toxic and rapidly produces 56 side- effects. It is virtually impossible to do a double- blind study under those circumstances. 2. The participants were all from the homosexual population in Miami, which is very clannish and highly communicative amongst themselves. This is supported by the fact that the placebo patients had an unprecedented 31 side effects. This incred- ible statistic could only occur with close communi- cation and comparison by the participants; and there- fore is tacit evidence that the double-blind code was broken and the study useless. Further on, I prove the code was broken. 3. All AIDS patients at the AIDS clinic were told they were going to die and that AZT was the only treat- ment available (although experimental). Under those conditions, any patient suspecting that they were on the placebo, would become devastated, lose all hope and die more quickly (a phenomena not unfa- miliar in medicine). It also explains why the \"pla- cebo\" group had 31 side effects from a substance that shouldn't produce any. Psychologically these patients would develop similar symptoms to their cohorts because emotionally they could not face the fact that they were facing certain death without even a chance to survive. There is proof the drug was shared. 81 DEADLY DECEPTION 4. The dishonesty of those in charge of the study becomes obvious when it is known, that when the researchers applied to the FDA to be able to test a larger number of individuals, they failed to reveal that after 48 weeks the death rate in both the drug and placebo groups were equal. BUT... Now comes the kicker! After the study was completed \u2014 long after the drug was approved by the FDA \u2014 the report submitted revealed the following facts: A. The participants in the study were aware who was on the placebo and who was on AZT. B. Some participants on AZT shared their drug with those who were on the placebo. (This means the study was completely invalid and the \"double-blind\" did not exist). C. The individuals on AZT required 3 to 8 times more transfusions than the placebo group. This is extremely revealing and alarming! It reveals why it appeared that the AZT group did so much better than the placebo group. Transfusions temporarily provide increased strength, sense of well-being and protection against infection. It is alarming because it indicates that AZT destroys the immune system and requires frequent extraordinary steps for survival. Subsequent studies, not funded by Burroughs-Wellcome indi- cate that AZT hastens death, and that the other studies with their remarkable results were obviously fraudulent.

Their articles are not printed in mainstream journals. Many have lost their licenses to practice medicine because they refuse to use orthodox methods such as killing their patients with AZT. In a \"disease\" that has no successful therapy, the suppression of innovative and creative thought is rampant and the lethal process goes on. This is one reason why the \"epidemic\" persists and we continue to 84 __add to the loss of lives, the loss of honest scientists and the loss of progress. The treatment of the 25 different diseases, when they do occur, should involve the ap- propriate antibiotics and antifungals if truly neces- sary (ozone and herbs are better) along with abstinence from drugs, change in diet and the addition of supple- ments and the safe therapies available (see the section on treatment). However, chemotherapy is absolutely contraindicated; and immune supportive therapy, which is available throughout the world should be tried, espe- cially in the immuno-compromised individual. 3K KK 2 2 2K 2K 2 2K 2 OK 2 ok OK OK OK OK WILL A VACCINE BE DEVELOPED AND DO WE REALLY WANT ONE? \"I ask you, what kind of scientist continues to support an hypoth- esis that fails to explain and fails to predict?\" Harvey Bialy, Editor, Bio/Technology It is with great trepidation that I contemplate the appearance of an AIDS vaccine. This pronouncement must shock you, so let me explain. First of all, vaccines are used to produce antibodies to fight a disease. However, the test for AIDS is a test indicating you have antibodies and therefore are immune to the disease. Why then do we want to produce what we already have and for a virus that is harmless? There is, however, another important objection. Though it is not generally known to the public, vaccination has been a controversial issue amongst scientific researchers for many de- cades. The true facts about vaccination have been effectively con- cealed or at least only partially presented, even to the medical profession. William F. Koch, a world renowned scientist in the field of virus and cancer research, wrote in his text, An Introduction To Free Radical Therapy (1961), \"The protein capsule (of the virus) has specific antigenic powers that yield specific immunological responses, and serological reactions. This is the part that is convert- 85 DEADLY DECEPTION ible into a vaccine used to excite immunological reactions in the patient. There is no immunological response to the nucleoprotein part though this is the part that causes the pathology.\" He then restates, \"...vaccines for a specific virus do not immunize against the nucleoprotein that is the actual pathogen, especially after it has penetrated and integrated with the host cell, so talk about curing...is a waste of time. Even the prevention of viral infection by vaccine is meeting the strongest statistical opposition since the large scale smallpox and Salk vaccinations have been recorded. In line with what is known about vaccine structure, statistics appear logical when they show that paralytic 'polio' is increased both in inci- dence and fatality by use of the vaccine.\" He then presents the number of cases of \"polio\" reported in major diverse areas of the U.S. and Canada before and after the use of the Salk vaccine. Let's take a look: EFFECTS OF POLIO VACCINE AREA No. of cases in yr. No. of cases in yr. REPORTED before the vaccine after the vaccine MONTREAL less than 100 cases 521 cases, 27 deaths OTTAWA 64 cases, 7 deaths 455 cases, 41 deaths (In all of Canada, there were 7 times more paralytic cases with a greater death rate, after the vaccine was used.) DETROIT 226 cases 697 cases UNITED STATES 5,987 cases 8,531 cases 3,090 paralyzed 5,661 paralyzed (In North Carolina and Tennessee, where vaccination was compulsory, there was a 400% increase) Koch then comments on his experience with hog cholera and rabies in Cuba and South America. \"It should be stated that every epidemic of viral disease treated...followed vaccination within a few months, when protection should have been had instead of an epidemic.\" 86 SMALLPOX About smallpox, Koch cites the Philippines where the U.S. Army forced the vaccination of 3,285,376 natives in 1918, \"when no epidemic was brewing\" and only mild sporadic cases were occurring. After being vaccinated, 47,369 came down with small- pox and 16,477 died. In 1919, they vaccinated 7,670,252 people, which resulted in 65,180 cases of smallpox and 44,408 deaths. The obvious question arises then as to why there has been a decrease in the diseases for which we vaccinate. This is precisely where the controversy lies. The opponents argue that most viral epidemics were already on the decrease when the vaccinations were employed and the major reason for this was the vast improve- ment in sanitation and hygiene. These are factual and strong argu- ments in view of our extensive knowledge about epidemiology and transmission. Proving it absolutely is very difficult. However, the figures speak for themselves. Almost all disease is more rampant where sanitation, hygiene and nutrition is poor. It is further argued that statistical dirty tricks are often employed by the Government, as is being done currently in the so-called AIDS epidemic. In \"polio\", for example, several diseases were renamed and placed under one banner. When the vaccine was introduced, the Centers for Disease Control issued \"...new diagnostic guidelines that rel- egated what would have been polio diagnoses back to the menin- gitis of pre-polio days.\" (T.C. Fry) BB OB BOB OR KR RRR * FACT: In 1984, Gallo bragged that a vaccine would be avail- able by 1986. Have you seen it? Perhaps we are better off! He is, because he's still getting grants in support of his quest for a vaccine. Gallo can't lose! He can get grants ad infinitum. If he does develop one, it won't cure AIDS and it could make him the wealthiest \"con man\" that ever lived.

Besides, with the shoddy epidemiological knowledge that we have, it would be impossible to arrive at any conclusion. New cases would continue to appear; and because HIV is not the cause, it would be assumed that the vaccine wasn't effective or that a new strain had appeared. Nothing would change and the farcical search would continue. 2 26 2k 9 2 OK OK 2K OK OK 2B OB OK OK OK OK OR The purpose of a vaccine is to stimulate the production of protective antibodies in order to prevent a disease. But we already have antibodies, which is why we don't get any disease from HIV and why you can't culture HIV if antibodies are present. However, we are told that the antibodies that humans have already produced do not protect us from getting AIDS. They happen to be right in this instance. How could they protect us if HIV doesn't cause AIDS? The testing of a vaccine will be a total farce and bring in billions more to the charlatans for a vaccine that will do nothing, except possibly kill or maim the recipients because of allergic reactions or contamination, like other vaccines have done. A vaccine for an epidemic that never ex- isted will undoubtedly be successful because it has nothing to accomplish! As long as people use drugs or have the need for many transfusions, there will be the same percentage of deaths from the same 25 diseases. They will simply reinstitute the old names and stop calling them AIDS.

The treatments are logical and are based upon \"state of the art\" knowledge, some of it dating back to the time of Hippocrates (400 B.C.) All of it is safe and is designed to improve health and therefore boost the immune system. Although antibiot- ics, antifungals and antiparasitics have been used in critical situations, natural products are preferred. The establishment refers to this therapeutic approach, even though successful, as \"anecdotal\" (a short narrative of interest, out of experience only), but lacking in scien- tific proof. How anxious establishment medicine is to forget and conceal that a study by the Office for Tech- nological Assessment, an agency of the U.S. Congress, in 1977, determined that 80% of medical therapies in use have never been scientifically proven, and there- fore 80% of what Medicine does is \"anecdotal\". ee ee All of the following therapies have been reported ef- fective in the treatment and/or the prevention of AIDS: 91 DEADLY DECEPTION DIET(S) A LOW FAT, LOW PROTEIN AND HIGH COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATE DIET. A mostly vegetarian diet, raw preferably, that includes a wide variety of nuts, legumes and fruits, would be preferred. A small amount of fish, chicken or meat (3 ounces), several times a week can be tolerated, and for many even necessary to insure an adequate essential amino acid intake. For those who will seek the advice in nutrition from a qualified nutritionist or alternative (Hippocratic) physician, a modified vegetarian diet can be monitored. Some advocate that protein be mainly ob- tained from lamb, venison, turkey, tempe and eggs. They can also recommend the appropriate nutritional supplements. Even the ultra-conservative American Cancer Society said a few years ago, that we could prevent 35% of all cancers with diet alone. If it can prevent cancer, why couldn't it be used as a treatment in cancer and AIDS? (Shhhh! Don't tell them \u2014 it's already been done!) ee ee A few extra tips: Go easy on peas, especially canned - too much selenium. Wash foods thoroughly with soap and water. Peel most fruits and vegetables because of insecticides (organically grown is best). Eat more rye and less wheat (avoid refined carbohydrates). Nuts should be eaten raw when possible (hold down peanuts). Chew food well and eat small amounts frequently. Drink lots of water, but not at mealtimes. Avoid milk and artificial drinks. Keep your bowels moving, an occasional enema is helpful when the bowels get sluggish or even as a routine, but use more frequently for gas and fullness. AVOID FRIED OR PROCESSED FOODS, CHEMICAL AD- DITIVES AND REFINED CARBOHYDRATES. Remember the old adage, \"If you can't pronounce it, don't eat it! 92 In using oils, linseed (flaxseed), olive, almond and safflower are fine if cold-pressed and unprocessed, but be on the lookout for and avoid hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Avoid foods baked with fat. Peppers and garlic are natural antibiotics. FRESH, RAW OR LIGHTLY COOKED FOODS ARE BEST. DRINK SEVERAL QUARTS OF PURE WATER EACH DAY. AVOID CAFFEINE, SALT AND SUGAR. oR oR 2 2K OK OR OK 2 OK OK OK OK oR OK OR OK OR THE BUDWIG DIET I am borrowing the following from my book, \"The Cancer Solution\" because it is one of the best immune supportive diets available. The diet is presented in two parts. The first section, I. PREVENTING AIDS, is for individuals who do not have AIDS, but who understand that their lifestyle (drug-use, self-abuse, etc.) is obvious risk behavior and therefore places them at great risk of developing AIDS. This diet is designed to correct much of the damage which has undoubtedly occurred. The second section, IT. IF YOU HAVE AIDS, is for individuals diagnosed with AIDS and are in need of a more aggressive approach. FOLLOW IT TO THE LETTER! I. PREVENTING AIDS PURE VIRGIN COLD-PRESSED UNPROCESSED LINSEED OIL (FLAXSEED OIL) - - - - - 1 TABLESPOON LOW FAT COTTAGE CHEESE - - - - - - 1/2 TO 1 CUP This basic combination of fatty acids and sulfur rich protein can be taken alone or in combination as a mixture. However, there are many ways that it can be varied by adding flavoring or other food ingredients to suit your own taste. (see below) 93 DEADLY DECEPTION THE RECOMMENDED DIET The diet which is slowly being recognized by all medical authorities as cancer preventive and immune-boosting stresses the intake of: Fresh Fruits - - - - - - - - 3 to 4 medium size portions daily Fresh Vegetables ------------------- 4 to 6 cups (Several tablespoons of linseeds and/or 1 to 2 tablespoons of the oil can be used in the salad dressing or on the vegetables) Be sure to include cabbage, broccoli, and maitake mushrooms Unprocessed whole grain breads and cereals - ------------- 3 to 4 cups or portions Fresh Fish (Preferably cold water variety) ------------- 4 to 8 oz. An excellent source of the omega-3 fatty acids is rainbow trout. Fresh Meat - Bred without hormones, fat producing diets or feed that has been grown with pesticides or antibiotics ~---------------- 31/2 oz. - 1 to 2 times a week. Liquids - Bottled water. If possible it should be purified by reverse osmosis, distillation and ozonation. There are many individuals who have difficulty with drinking the eight glasses a day that are recommended. Suggestion: place one glass of your favorite juice in a liter or quart bottle and fill the remainder with water. It is refreshing. Herbal teas Fresh fruit juices - (citrus fruits should not be taken within several hours of the linseed oil-cottage cheese portions) Caution: Remember that eating any processed oils will coun- teract everything you are trying to do. They are poison, as are all fried foods. Eliminate as much sugar as possible from the 94 diet. Remember that honey (not royal jelly) is primarily sugar. Prepared foods must be devoid of all artificial preservatives or chemical additives. Artificial sweeteners are absolutely forbid- den! If god didn't make it or you can't pronounce it - Don't eat it! Helpful Hints: The first time I tried linseed oil on a salad, I was pleasantly surprised. I had expected it to taste strange or unusual. It didn't \u2014 it tasted great! The mixture with the low-fat cottage cheese was even more exciting than I anticipated. I actually looked forward to eating a slice of the multi-grain bread covered with a thick layer of the mixture. I do realize that you cannot argue taste, and that taste varies tremendously. With that in mind, I am provid- ing a whole list of ingredients and suggestions for making the Budwig \"formula\" a delight for your palate. For Breakfast: Fruit Juice Cereal - ground linseeds, whole grains and nuts, raisins, chopped fresh fruits, linseed oil and low-fat cottage cheese, '/3 to '/2 cup low-fat milk, and honey mixed well in a blender. Eggs - blend 2 eggs with 1 teaspoon of linseed oil and 1 table- spoon low-fat cottage cheese; add chopped tomato, onions and green pepper, herbs and spices; slowly bake or broil. \"Coffee\" - made from roasted cereals For Lunch or Dinner: Salad - any desired mixture of greens, vegetables or fruits. Dressings: low-fat cottage cheese and linseed oil mixture, then add for: Honey Mustard: 1 tsp. honey and 1/2 tsp. of Dijon mustard Creamy Italian: vinegar, herbs (Italian), then for taste varia- tion, add any combination of spices, mustard, raw egg, garlic, onion powder, crushed anchovies 95 DEADLY DECEPTION Green Goddess: minced spinach, cucumber parsley, lemon and dill. Mexican: minced chile, red peppers, tomato onion, herbs and Spices. Fruit: honey, crushed nuts, poppy seeds and linseeds - touch of cinnamon, lemon and/or mustard if desired. Soups: Gazpacho Soup: dilute basic mixture with low-fat milk and add: tomatoes, garlic, cucumber, onions, herbs and spices; blend well and chill. Bean Soups: prepare your favorite soup in the usual way and add the Budwig mix to it. Other Soups: tomato and onion soups can be made as usual and the Budwig mix added. Cooked Vegetables: steam cook and coat with oil and spices. Honey and oil is great for corn and sweet potato. Baked potato goes well with mix, oil alone or with onions, parsley cle: Dessert: The basic mixture plus cut up peaches, berries, flavor- ing, nuts, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, honey and your per- sonal creativeness. Il. IF YOU HAVE AIDS: It is imperative that you follow the diet exactly \u2014 no cheating is allowed! Dr. Budwig placed great stress on following the diet exactly. Her many years of experience have convinced her that failures do not occur except when the patient is lax with her treatment. Use the linseed oil more frequently during and for in- between meal snacks. 96 Wrapping the body in linseed oil-soaked cloths, the part that is effected by the AIDS, is very helpful. For example, if you have a liver involvement, wrap the waist. If it is the lungs, wrap the chest. If it is the brain, wrap the head and neck, and so on. This is best accomplished during the night and whenever the opportunity al- lows. The oil can be mixed with rose water to add an esthetic touch. Cold pressed and unprocessed walnut, pumpkin and soybean oil can be used in addition to linseed oil for variety. I strongly recom- mend, in addition to the vitamins and minerals already suggested, that particular emphasis be placed on making sure you take the recommended doses of vitamins C, E, selenium and Beta-carotene.

One is from the sea and the other comes from freshwater lakes and brackish water. Ap- proximately fifteen years ago, Spirulina became popular as an 98 agent to losing weight, when included in a diet. In 1982 I did the world's first double-blind study on the use of Spirulina in a diet program. It proved to be effective. In the course of preparing for this study, I reviewed a large volume of literature that had been printed about spirulina. Most notable, was a World Health Organi- zation report which outlined the composition of this algae and stated that it was the world's richest source of plant protein. Its very unusual amino acid composition is exceptional, not only amongst plants, but animal tissue also. It has been recommended by WHO as the most likely solution, as a source of protein, for the world's hungry. Wide varieties exist and are often divided by their color, i.e. blue algae, blue-green algae, and brown algae. They uniformly are rich sources of beta-carotene, which is noted for its anti-oxidant activity, and, therefore, provides for their ability to inhibit cancer growth. CHLORELLA Chlorella has been investigated more than any other algae. F. Konishi, S. Matsueda, N. A. Firsova and Y. Miyazawa have all written scientific papers on the anti-tumor activity of chlorella, particularly in breast cancer and leukemia. J. Schwartz and G. Shklar utilized Spirulina and Dunaliella in their experiments on hamsters and demonstrated truly remarkable anti-cancer activity. BUGULA Bugula neretina, an ocean invertebrate, is a plant-like species, which grows under water. It contains bryostatins which have been shown to stimulate immunity. Leukemia in mice and in humans has been effectively inhibited by this chemical (R. Eckert, Exp Clin Endocrinol, 1990, N. Lilley, Cancer Research, 1990, and R. J. Jones, Blood, 1990). GARLIC Eat lots of fresh garlic and take supplemental capsules. It is an incredible antibiotic and anti-cancer food. Try to get the equivalent of 12,000 mgm of garlic daily (Allin - 20,000 mcg, Allicin Yield - 3,000 mcg, Sulphur - 16,000 mcg). 99 DEADLY DECEPTION BEE POLLEN It has been demonstrated that bee pollen is a complete source of nutrition for humans. One of the reasons you have not heard much about it, is because it cannot be synthesized and, therefore, does not get the usual publicity that is given to food substances, supplements and drugs that can be manufactured. Investigators have indicated that there is a special property to pollen that is collected by bees rather than pollen that is collected mechanically from plants. N. V. Tsitsin, of Russia, in studying the life habits of individu- als of the Caucasus region that lived 125 years or more, found that they ate pure bee pollen from the bee hives, as one of their food staples. The effect on longevity was confirmed by N. P. Yoirich of the Soviet Academy. Other scientists in the former Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and France support these findings. If you decide to add bee pollen to your diet, make sure that you are using bee pollen or royal jelly and not flower pollen. W. Robinson reported that bee pollen contained an anti-carcinogenic substance which slowed the growth of breast tumors (Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 1948). P. Hernuss of the University of Indiana, advocated the use of bee pollen during radiation therapy for cancer, as it decreased many of the severe side effects. The source of bee pollen is very impor- tant for the pollen to be fully enzymatically active. There are very few places in the world where the flowers are free of fertilizers and insecticides. It is also important that the pollen has not been pro- \u00bb cessed or treated with dangerous chemicals. Excessive heating destroys many of the active ingredients. BIOFLAVONOIDS Bioflavonoids are a complex of substances such as hesperidin and rutin. The primary source is in the white pulp of citrus fruits and is also found in apricots, plums, grapes, blackberries, etc. In medicine it has been recognized for many decades that bioflavonoids are responsible for maintaining the integrity of small blood vessels. When an individual develops black and blue marks easily, the use of bioflavonoids quickly remedies the problem. Toxic copper is also removed from the body by bioflavonoids. 100 Quercetin, which is another bioflavonoid, was shown by M. Yoshida et al. to inhibit the growth of human cancer cells. CABBAGE (INDOLES) Since ancient times, cabbage has been eaten for its therapeutic effects. There is no question that this vegetable, along with others of the cruciferous species, i.e. Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and broccoli, contain indoles. Indoles have been shown experimentally to be effective in the prevention of breast, stomach and colon cancer. It is also protective against radiation (P. N. Albert, J. Ethnopharmacol. 1983; G.S. Stoewsand, 1988; contain another substance, sulphoraphane, which ex- hibits very strong anti-cancer effects. U. Zhang, et al., and H. J. Prochaska, presented this information to the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.A.) 1992. Expert opinion is overwhelming toward inclusion in the family diet. DHEA (DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE) DHEA is classified as a hormone and is the second most abundant steroid produced in the body. Cholesterol is the most abundant. It is secreted by the adrenal glands and very little is known about its function. The production of DHEA declines mark- edly with age to a level of 5% in the very old when compared to the young. In 1981, A. G. Schwartz in an article in Nutrition and Cancer explained in detail the complicated role DHEA played in inhibiting the development of cancer. He noted that cancer causing sub- stances (carcinogens) required metabolic activation by oxidative enzymes to cause cancer. DHEA inhibits this process by lowering the levels of these oxidases. The decline in DHEA production parallels a rise in the incidence of cancer, obesity and heart disease. FATTY ACIDS FROM FISH OILS Many studies have established that the high intake of fish oil is related to a low incidence of cancers of the breast, colon and pancreas. The Omega-3 group of fatty acids are the main com- 101 DEADLY DECEPTION pounds of fish oil. Their role as a treatment in arthritis and heart disease is becoming more widely accepted. Obtainable at health food stores and pharmacies everywhere. FATTY ACIDS FROM VEGETABLE SOURCES There are vegetable sources of the Omega-3 fatty acids and they include the herb purslane. The importance of the role of the essential fatty acids began 150 years ago, with the work of Profes- sor B. J. van Liebig. Many scientists have published literally thou- sands of papers on this subject and in 1920, the Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine was won by Dr. Otto Meyerhof, who demonstrated the role of linoleic acid and sulphur proteins in the oxygenation of tissue. In the eleven years that followed, two more Nobel prizes were won by Albert Szent-Gyorgy and Dr. Otto Warburg in 1931. Both related to the role of fatty acids, oxygen- ation of tissue and the development of cancer. Butter and cream contain trace amounts of fatty acids. Linseed oil and cottage cheese, however, contain far greater amounts and are certainly a more beneficial way of securing these important food substances. EVENING PRIMROSE OIL Evening Primrose oil is an excellent source of gammalinolenic acid (GLA). Elsewhere in this book the roll of this fatty acid is discussed at length in relation to linseed oil, another excellent source of fatty acids. Evidence exists that GLA can normalize malignant cells and even reverse their growth. The work of David F. Horrobin (Medical Hypotheses, 1980) is supported by research- ers, C van der Merwe, F. Fujiwara, N. Dippenaar, Y. Haiashi, M. E. Begin, S. [kushima, W. P. Leary, J. H. Botha, J. Booyens, L. Koenig, U. N. Das, N. S. Gardener, J. R. Duncan and C. S. Cunnane. The papers produced by these various investigators show that GLA is effective against bladder cancer, melanomas, breast, lung, prostate and nerve tissue cancers. FIBER In the 1960's Denis Burkitt studied the effect of the fiber-rich diet of Africans on the very low incidence of colon cancer. In 1978, 102 he published a landmark article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition which indicated the important roll of fiber in the preven- tion of colon cancer. With the increase of commercially produced low fiber foods, the incidence of colon cancer has increased from rare to common. The advice given by physicians, who advocated dietary measures in the prevention and treatment of disease, was, for many years, looked upon as quackery. Dr. Burkitt, who was extremely famous, could not be ignored. Fiber works through the following pathways: 1. Absorption and elimination of carcinogenic substances (S. A. Bingham, Proc Nutr Soc., 1990). 2. Facilitation and elimination of excess estrogen (D. J. Pusateri, American Journal of Clinical Nutri- tion, 1990). 3. Conversion of bile acids that can damage DNA (P. Y. Cheha and H. Burnstein, Nutr. Cancer, 1990). Different sources of fiber have different effects. Rice bran was found to stimulate the immune system and, in mice, was effective against carcinomas (E. Ito, 1985). ADDITIONAL HERBS (for Monilia, Thrush, Candida) Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) as a tea or capsules. OTHER SUPPLEMENTS Dimethylglycine - enhances cellular and humoral mediated immune responses. 50 mgm 3 times a day. Caprylic Acid - useful in the treatment of Monilia infections (Candida, Thrush) - 1 gm with meals. 103 DEADLY DECEPTION Lactobacillus acidophilus - effective in Candida. Pau D'Arco Tea - for all infections. There were several other supplements I would usually recom- mend; however, the FDA found out that they were effective in treating disease, so they took them off the market (amino acids and vitamins are next!). Now you will have to pay a doctor in order to get a prescription for them. The problem is that most doctors are not even aware of them, and in spite of their ignorance, their arrogance will take over and they will proclaim anything other than their dangerous drugs as useless. Find a \"holistic\" or \"alternative\" physician! The American College of Advanced Medicine has a listing of hundreds of well- informed doctors. They include in their practices therapies that are an effective alternative to the dangerous and often ineffective techniques and drugs of the establishment. They are very knowl- edgeable and use many standard therapies that are truly safe and effective. Their enlightenment provides them with an armamen- tartum far more extensive, varied and effective than that provided by the clones of the establishment. A VERY IMPORTANT WORD ABOUT OZONE In the very next section, under medical therapies, I discuss ozone therapy. I make mention of it here because the FDA is currently using their gestapo tactics to remove ozone equipment from doctor's offices. This is in direct violation to the mandates of the U.S. Congress and the \"grandfather\" clause. Therefore, I.V. ozone can only be obtained from a few physicians whose dedica- tion and bravery are exemplary. However, this exceptionally safe therapy can be accomplished with a little ingenuity and a little help from a friend. After you have read the next section, return and re- read the paragraphs that follow. HOME OZONE ADMINISTRATION If you obtain a quality ozone water purification unit (see resources) that is capable of putting out 30-50 mcg of ozone per 104 milliliter (70 gm productive capacity) you can obtain an excellent therapeutic effect (see resource section at the end of this book). PRACTICAL TECHNIQUES Vaginal or rectal insufflation Ozone concentration of 30-50 mcg/ml instilled by continuous flow through a bubble bottle (to moisturize the ozone) for 4-5 minutes using a soft plastic disposable urinary catheter. Next to I.V. administration this is the most efficient way of getting ozone into the body. Whirlpool bath and shower Ozone can be piped into a filter shower head or a portable whirlpool unit that fits over the edge of the bathtub. The oxygen content of the blood can be elevated 300% in 15 minutes. Drinking water Bubbling ozone into your reverse osmosis water for 10 sec- onds, just prior to drinking it, is one other way of boosting the body's ability to achieve optimal health.

CHELATION THERAPY What is chelation? Chelation therapy is probably the most significant medical discovery of this century. The benefits derived exceed that of any other single modality and extend to almost every disease known to medicine. The word chelate (pronounced key-late) is derived from the Greek \"chele\" meaning \"claw\". Crabs and lobsters are chelates. In biochemistry, a chelating agent is one that grasps metals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, deadly mercury and lead, and carries them out of the body without entering the body chemistry. 107 DEADLY DECEPTION The chemical ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) was first synthesized in Germany in the late 1930's for use in industry and reported in 1952 as a treatment for lead poisoning. It remains the treatment of choice for heavy metal poisoning throughout the world. Chelation is one of the most important natural processes in nature. It makes possible the utilization of inorganic minerals by plants and animals (that includes humans). Everyone is familiar with at least two chelating agents, chlorophyll and hemoglobin, but they were probably never identified as such when you learned about them in school. 3K 2K 3 2K 2K 6 OK 2B OK OK OR KOR OK OK KK HOW DOES CHELATION WORK? Chelation promotes health by correcting the underlying cause of arterial blockage. Oxygen-free radicals are increased by the presence of metallic elements in the body. They are damaging to tissue because they act as a chronic irritant to blood vessel walls and cell membranes. EDTA removes those metallic irritants, al- lowing leaking and damaged cell walls to heal. This markedly improves oxygen delivery to the cell and the elimination of the waste products of metabolism from the cell. The plaques lining the walls of the arteries shrink and smooth over, thus allowing more blood to circulate. The blood vessel walls regain their elasticity and respond to changes in pressure more readily. Thousands of studies bear witness to the ability of EDTA to increase blood flow signifi- cantly. Thus chelation is of great benefit in several ways: 1. Improves circulation, which; 2. Delivers oxygen to the cells, which; 3. Removes poisonous compounds, which; 4. Improves cell membrane transfer of nutrients and waste, which; 5. Allows for better mobilization and implementation of all defensive protective mechanisms, offensive weapons against 108 disease and reparative processes necessary for healing to take place. WHAT IS CHELATION USED FOR? The most important use of chelation has been in the treatment of atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis. By chelating out the cal- occlude arterial walls, EDTA, ad- ministered intravenously, markedly improves circulation to every part of the body including the heart and the brain. We have all been exposed to metallic poison most of our lives. Mercury, lead and cadmium are the most deadly. All metals can be toxic if present in excessive amounts, or if they have been deposited where they don't belong. Compounds are formed that interfere with normal metabo- lism and promote the formation of destructive tissue changes. It immediately becomes apparent that chelation has to be beneficial in any disease in which improved circulation and the elimination of toxic substances aid in the body's ability to heal itself. Virtually every disease is in that category, without exception. Chelation has improved heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, arthritis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Studies indicate a 50% reduction in the occurrence of cancer in individuals who have received EDTA. Chelation has been reported to improve asthma, emphysema, brain function, muscular coordination, multiple sclerosis and impotence, It also slows down the aging process by preventing free radical damage and... IMPROVES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONSE ARK AB BK EB OB OK BOK BR KE HAS CHELATION BEEN FULLY TESTED AND IS IT SAFE? More than 500,000 patients have received chelation therapy in the United States alone. It has been primarily used in coronary artery disease and peripheral occlusive vascular disease. The abil- ity of chelation to safely improve serious heart and circulatory problems has consistently been reported in the 90% range. The 109 DEADLY DECEPTION safety record for its use has been exceptional. More than 30 million treatments have been administered without a single serious compli- cation, except in rare instances when the standard rules of proce- dure are not followed and the patient is not properly evaluated. Not one single death has been directly caused by chelation therapy when administered by a properly trained physician. Compare that with the 5%-6% death rate from bypass surgery, which does not even extend life expectancy. Today there are over 1000 scientific papers that support the many biochemical actions of EDTA, and over two dozen clinical papers, including double-blind studies, which support the incredible medical benefits to patients in a wide variety of conditions. There have been only two papers which have criticized the use of EDTA. These papers are based on opinion or apply to techniques which have been obsolete for decades. They come from physicians who have a vested interest in catheterization and surgery. ee IS CHELATION JUST EDTA? In addition to EDTA, the intravenous infusions contain from five to twenty other ingredients designed to replace the good min- erals which may be removed with the bad. Substantial amounts of vitamin C and other vitamins are included as well as blood thinners and other substances which safely enhance EDTA. Any intelligent therapy involves change in life-style and diet. Chelation is no exception! EDTA can be used in combination with almost any other therapy. It is always important for the physician to know everything the patient is taking. Chelation often eliminates the need or reduces the dosage of the medicines a patient may be taking. 2B KB ROK OK 8 OK OK 2 OK OK OR OK OK ORK CAN ANYBODY TAKE CHELATION? The only major contraindication to chelation therapy is kidney failure. Even then it may be possible to use it, if administered in reduced dosage, with careful monitoring. 7B BR 8 OB OK OR OK OK 2 2K OK 2 OB OK OK OK 110 HOW DO I KNOW IF I NEED CHELATION? If you are from this planet you probably need it! However, chelation is most likely imperative if you are short of breath, have chest pain, leg pain while walking, transient or progressive loss of vision or memory, paralysis, poor circulation, gangrene, diabetes, or any disease for that matter. For all of these symptoms or condi- tions, and even if you have had by-pass surgery and would like to avoid one, two, or three more death-defying leaps into the operat- ing room, see a physician that does not chelation immediately! It is legal in many states in the U.S. for use in cardiovascular disease and even cancer. Although chelation therapy is recognized world-wide for mercury and lead poisoning, its use in cancer and other degenerative diseases places the administering physician under great risk of harassment and loss of license. IS CHELATION USEFUL IN CANCER? Many clinics in Europe, Mexico and South America, use che- lation in the treatment of cancer. Simple logic dictates that any therapy that improves the general circulation is likely to be useful in the treatment of any disease, particularly in cancer. This is not to imply that it has a direct effect on cancer cells. Walter Blumer, M.D. and Elmer M. Cranton, M.D., in the Journal of Advancement In Medicine, Volume 2, 1989 presented an 18-year follow-up study on 59 patients that had been treated with calcium-EDTA (chela- tion). The study evaluated the incidence of mortality from cancer. They reported that only one of the 59 patients died of cancer during this period. This represented only 1.7%. A control group of 172 individuals from the same area was evaluated and the incidence of cancer was 17.6% (30 out of 172 persons died of cancer). This is a 90% reduction in cancer mortality for the chelation-treated group. A careful statistical analysis failed to reveal any other factors which were different between the two groups \u2014 chelation was the only difference! I think it is safe to say that anything that prevents, is likely to help improvement. Remember that the incidence of the cancers that occur in immune deficiencies can actually be predicted on the basis of 111 DEADLY DECEPTION the type of drugs used or the exposure to other chemicals, radiation and malnutrition. ORR RRR AGK WHAT IS THE COST? Chelation usually costs $2,000 to $6,000 for 20 to 40 treat- ments. Every cell and every artery in the body is safely benefited, while in by-pass surgery less than one inch of an artery is removed at mortal risk. By-pass surgery is usually more than $40,000, does nothing for the rest of your body and does not extend your life. I think we are all worth the price of a used car! 2B 2K 2 28 2K 8 OK OK 26 OK 2 OK OK OR OK OK oR CHELATION PROTOCOL The first protocol outlined is the basic protocol recommended by The American College of Advanced Medicine. 1.

This chapter presents information about its history and how it is being used by thousands of practitioners throughout the world. It is presented for informa- tional purposes only. ABOUT OZONE The discovery and naming of ozone is attributed to Christian Friedrich Schonbein in 1840. Its value in medicine was debated for 114 many decades and references to its use were sporadic. Dr. Albert Wolf, a German physician wrote in 1915, \"As regards the medical usability of ozone, the viewpoint of experimental science may be considered as being in direct opposition to the practical experi- ences gained by industry.\" He used ozone successfully in the treatment of decubitus ulcers. During the First World War (1915) ozone gas was used to help the healing of serious wounds. Ozone has been used to purify the drinking water of major cities since 1901. The first was Vienna and the most recent is Los Angeles. It does not give water the disagreeable taste that chlorine does. Al- though many authorities refer to it as poisonous and a hazard to life, like anything else on this planet, if used properly it is beneficial \u2014 in fact, life would become extinct without ozone in our atmosphere. The breathing of inappropriate concentrations is indeed harmful to the lungs, but in proper concentrations it purifies the air we breathe. Home and industrial ozonators are used to purify the air throughout the world (including the United States), and yet, comments are being made publicly by authoritative figures that ozone is poison- ous and a hazard to life. This is indeed true if, as in the case of any substance on this earth, it is used in unsafe amounts. Statements of this nature are unjustified and fraudulent when they are intended to misinform or alarm the public in a way that would indicate that ozone is unsafe under any circumstances. Ozone is created by the action of ultraviolet light or a strong electrical field on oxygen atoms. The result is the forcing together of 3 atoms into unstable groups (O;) that rather quickly break down into the usual oxygen molecule (O,). Ozone is lethal to almost all viruses, bacteria, fungus and cancer cells. The scientific literature is replete with articles proving these facts. Ozone is formed in our atmosphere naturally by the effect of lightning on oxygen. It is that wonderful sweet smell that you can detect after a summer storm. It is nature's method of cleansing our atmosphere of contamination. The poisonous ozone levels reported effecting our cities differ dramatically in that they represent the combining of the extensive, overwhelming pollution with ozone insufficient to do the job. If you wonder why cancer rates have tripled in the last 20 years, consider this startling fact: Oxygen represented 36% of the air we breathed 200 years ago. Today it is only 19%! 115 DEADLY DECEPTION In 1931, Dr. Otto Warburg was awarded the Nobel Prize in biochemistry. Dr. Warburg demonstrated that the metabolism of a cancer cell was like that of a plant cell, which thrives on carbon dioxide and gives off oxygen as its waste product. It actually represents the process of fermentation. We are composed of animal cells, and oxygen is essential for our assimilation of nutrients and the detoxification and elimination of waste products. When ozone is introduced into the bloodstream, it is converted into oxygen, hydroxyperoxides and other beneficial free-radical scavengers which actually seek out and destroy diseased cells. Nearly 50 years later, the prestigious journal Science, Vol. 209, _ 22 August 1980, published a paper entitled: \"Ozone Selectively Inhibits Growth of Human Cancer Cells\". This paper dealt with the exposure of human lung, breast and uterine cancer tissue to ozone at concentrations of 0.3 to 0.8 parts per million, well within the non-toxic limits (OSHA standards). More than 1,000 parts per million can be tolerated safely during the average ten-minute pe- riod that medically-administered ozone takes; and concentrations far less than those are used. During the experience, normal human cells were not effected at these levels. The modern development of ozone application in medicine began in the 1950's in Europe, and its use gradually spread throughout Europe to Australia, Israel and Brazil. Intra-venous ozone gas is extremely safe and effective against all infections. The earliest evidence that I could locate of its recom- mendation as therapy in the United States, appeared in an 1885 issue of the Journal of the Dade County Medical Association. In spite of this and many other references prior to 1920, the FDA has illegally raided and confiscated ozone generators from the offices of advanced (alternative) physicians. Ozone is classified as a toxic gas if inhaled in large quantities. However, it is not toxic when injected into the body by intra- arterial injections, I. V., intramuscularly, subcutaneously or by vagi- nal or rectal insufflation. Ozone has no side effects when administered, using these methods, in the proper quantities and concentrations. It does not adversely effect healthy cells of any type under those conditions. It is obvious why it is lethal to cancer cells. The cancer (plant) cell is being given its toxic waste product, while our normal cells are being given their essential for life. Individuals receiving ozone 116 for the first time are usually apprehensive. It is scary to have \"air\" injected into their veins. They have images of dying from an air embolus. Almost everyone seems to recollect a murder mystery in which the villain killed his victim that way in the hopes of commit- ting the perfect crime. It will never happen in real life because: 1. Nitrogen would have to be present in order to cause a toxic reaction; and therapeutically only pure medical grade oxy- gen is used. 2. It would take at least 50 cc of gas given within 2 to 3 seconds. That could only be accomplished with a very large bore 18 gauge needle. The procedure is done with a tiny 25 gauge needle. Death could only occur intentionally, never accidentally. Specific therapeutic applications of ozone include the treat- ment of circulatory problems, decubitus ulcers, some forms of cancer (still under investigation as to how many), AIDS, viral diseases, wounds, scars, burns, gangrene, and liver disease includ- ing hepatitis. Ozone is the only substance known which acts as a virucide, bactericide, fungicide, protozoacide and cancericidal. Over 1000 medical papers exist in the world medical literature attesting to its efficacy in the treatment of disease in many tens of thousands of patients. Typically it has been ignored in America because it can't be patented. Therefore it is not profitable for the pharmaceutical industry to spend the millions of dollars necessary to prove its effectiveness by FDA standards. It would reap scorn and outrage of incredible proportions if the truth were known. The pharmaceutical industry and the FDA confuse and distort the role of ozone in our ecosystem and suppress its use therapeutically (even though, under law, it should be \"grandfathered in\"). In addition to the many articles on the use of ozone in medicine, there are medical texts such as The Use of Ozone in Medicine by Prof. Siegfried Rilling, M.D. and Renate Viebahn, Ph.D., and medical organizations in the major industrial nations of the world dedicated to the education and instruction of its use. A World of Ozone Conference has been held frequently since the early 1970's. The most recent held in San Francisco (1993), was attended by hundreds of doctors from many countries. Russia 117 DEADLY DECEPTION sent seven scientists to present papers on the applications of ozone. In no other science does it take as long as it does in medicine for discovery to be accepted. The use of deep freezing techniques took over 80 years and television over 30 years, but in medicine, where human life is at stake, it can take 150 years, and maybe never, if there is no profit to be made. Fortunately for mankind, there are still countries where investigation into non-drug, non-patentable, non-toxic and inexpensive therapies are still being carried out. The Proceedings of the World Ozone Conferences have docu- mented and published the techniques and dosages of ozone for its beneficial use in the following conditions: Cancer (Carcinoma) Spastic Colon \u2014 Proctitis Osteomyelitis Acne Varicosities Bladder Fistula Wounds, Ulcers Chronic Cystitis Phlebitises Infections Ulcerative Colitis Mucous Colitis Hemorrhoids Thrombosis Intrarectal insufflation is excellent for diarrhea and candidiasis (in women intravaginal insufflation is also effective), and it is applied in this manner when intravenous administration is imprac- tical or unavailable. As long as the lobbyists and influence peddlers for the pharma- ceutical industry and the AMA are able to convince our represen- tatives that anything outside of the mainstream of medicine is either useless, fraudulent or dangerous, many safe, non-toxic and effective therapies will be denied to the public. Our representatives must be made aware that although safety is not usually the prob- lem; proof of efficacy by the double-blind standard is economically prohibitive. In those instances where such proof has been offered, fraudulent tactics by the opposition have resulted in blocking the use of some incredible therapies (see the chapters on amygdalin and chelation). If you want to know what benefits ozone bestows in disease, ask the doctors and patients who have used it \u2014 but, of course, that's anecdotal! 118 THE IMPORTANCE OF OXYGEN Virtually every patient's room in a modern hospital is equipped for the administration of oxygen. Certainly, an emergency room cannot be without one because it is required by law. Deep breathing exercises are prescribed for patients with lung problems and for individuals recovering from surgery. The narrow use of these techniques are indeed unfortunate. They should be routine for all patients. The local gymnasiums and health spas routinely employ the proper use of deep breathing exercises. The average person takes their respiration for granted. There are large religious cults who incorporate consciousness of breathing as an important ritual of their beliefs. Indians refer to \"Prana\" as a wonderful substance that God has provided for a healthy life. Certainly, Prana is oxygen, or possibly even ozone. Both aptly fit their description. Obviously, deep breathing exercises carry greater importance today, because of the lowered concentration in our atmosphere, than ever before. The effect of gradual oxygen deprivation on metabolism is devas- tating and leads to an inadequate processing of the toxic wastes that our bodies are constantly producing. One of the consequences of lowered oxygen concentration is the elevation of uric acid in the body. This one compound alone, is implicated in a wide variety of metabolic problems. The most common disease associated with a uric acid disorder is gout and it is primarily due to an inability to process meat protein. However, the far reaching effects on almost every system of the body gives us an indication of the widespread effect that a low-grade increase can have. The formation of stones in the kid- neys and gallbladder, the blocking of circulation and the destruc- tion of joints by the formation of crystals are just a few of the problems that arise. There are literally hundreds of known bio- chemical reactions in the body that utilize oxygen. There are prob- ably many thousands more waiting to be discovered. Acute deprivation of oxygen leads to a rapid death; we are simply getting there more slowly. The importance of oxidative processes is dis- cussed more fully elsewhere, but the relationship with the develop- ment and progress of cancer is no longer in doubt. The use of ozone appears to go beyond the benefit of oxygen in the treatment of 119 DEADLY DECEPTION disease. The production of electromagnetic energy at the molecular level, as the ozone molecule disassociates into oxygen, undoubt- edly plays a role in its usefulness in therapy. I will list just a few of the proven effects of ozone. OZONE ACTIONS 1. Ozone activates the enzymes involved in peroxide or oxy- gen \"free radical\" destruction, i.e. Glutathione, catalase, S.0.D. glycolysis (breakdown of glycogen) in RBCs resulting in: a. Increasing the release of O, from the hemoglobin in the blood to the tissues. b. Enhancing formation of acetyl coenzyme a which is vital in metabolic detoxification. c. Influencing the mitochondrial transport system which enhances the metabolism of all cells and safeguards against mutagenic changes. d. Increasing red blood cell pliability, blood fluidity and arterial pO, (oxygen content) and a decrease in Rouleaux formation (clumping) which interferes with the normal functioning of red blood cell metabolism. 3. Increases leukocytosis (production of white blood cells) and phagocytosis (the manner in which certain white blood cells destroy foreign matter). Both processes are part of the immune defense system. 4. Stimulates the reticulo - endothelial system, the rebuilding of tissue. 5. Strong germicide \u2014 inactivates enteroviruses' coliform bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromona hydrophilia. 6. Disrupts the cell envelope of many pathogenic organisms which are composed of phospholipids, peptidoglycans and polysaccharides. 120 7. Opens the circular plasmid DNA which lessens bacterial proliferation. 8. Fungicidal, inhibits candida cell growth. 9. Low doses stimulate the immune system 10. High doses inhibit the immune system 11. Limit dose to 3000 ug. References: The information for this chapter is culled from the hundreds of papers presented at the World Conferences on Ozone. The scarcity of information available in the major medical journals is testimony to the power of the pharmaceutical industry. With good reason, they have established a wall of silence and the dissemi- nation of falsehoods around the use of ozone. They have an entire market of antibiotics at stake. There is no evidence that anyone has died from ozone therapy, and my conversations with practitioners in several countries, including the United States, confirms the remarkable results that I observed first-hand in my own practice. 2B OK 28 2K OB OB 2 ROK OR KOK OE OK BOK OK DINITROCHLOROBENZENE (DNCB) This photochemical has been used for HIV disease for 8 years.

They have been systematically ignored because they shake the foundations of the current allopathic approach of modern medicine and would render the stranglehold of the pharmaceutical industry impotent.

A physician or herbalist knowledgeable in this area should be consulted. HERBS Note: The use of herbs is not recognized by the FDA or the medical establishment. Many herbs are used by herbalists, naturopaths, and other practitioners in many states. However, they are generally not allowed to make any claims in reference to their use. The informa- tion provided in this chapter is for the enlightenment of the reader and is not to be considered as advice or recommendations of a medical nature. It is my personal medical opinion! The use of herbs and herbal mixtures date back thousands of years. Their use is well documented in the hundreds of books published in the last century alone. If a medical claim is made for them by a company, the FDA usually steps in and confiscates the product. The First Amendment (free speech) allows a book or a 122 periodical to write about their use, but a company cannot provide the same information on the label or in literature in any way associated with the company. This also applies to vitamins, miner- als and other supplements. As I write, most herbs are still available in many herbal shops and health food stores. Physicians of medicine, with a few exceptions, know nothing of the use of herbs in the prevention and treatment of disease. Many aren't even aware that digitalis is an herb. Its use in modern medicine exists only because of the curiosity and diligence of a young physician centuries ago. Pharmaceutical companies pro- duced it and then extracted its \"active\" ingredients in order to obtain a patent. The reason given, of course, is that they wanted to provide a more potent product and one in which the dosage could be more accurately controlled. This is true only in part. The power and toxicity of digitoxin, digoxin, etc., are well known to every physician. Past physicians, dead or no longer in practice, felt more comfortable in the safety of the original digitalis leaf. Younger physicians coming into practice in the 50's had no means for comparison, and were being taught pharmacology with emphasis on the newer preparations in medical school. In practice, the influ- ence of pharmaceutical detail persons (salespersons) from most companies have a significant impact on the busy physician who often foolishly believes that they are truly knowledgeable enough to provide a quick educational summary on the product. This is rarely true. These representatives are frequently misinformed by their companies and instructed to stress the \"good\" points and leave out the bad. The record of pharmaceutical companies on drug recalls and claim revisions is witness to the dishonesty of the industry and to the flaws and ill-placed dependency on what is obviously and incorrectly referred to as the \"scientific\" method of proof. A basic error in the current scientific approach to therapeutics is the belief that the individual parts of biological phenomenon can explain the whole phenomena itself. This might indeed be true if we actually: had all the parts; understood their inter-relationship completely, comprehended the synergism involved in the complex inter-reac- tions and their ultimate effects on the whole; and realized fully the changes occurring constantly because of the effects of time, inten- sity, thought, emotions and the infinite kinds of variations in the internal and external environment of that whole. Put simply, sci- 123 DEADLY DECEPTION ence today arrogantly and ignorantly formulates an indelible, im- movable position which it calls scientific fact and proof, and then is forced to explain failure on the basis of \"side-effects, \"compli- cations\" or the \"patient failed to respond\". An incredible example of this tragic folly is the unfolding of the current AIDS scam. In this instance, the AIDS hypothesis has named an innocuous virus, that is present everywhere and has been around for centuries (we have become aware of its presence be- cause of new instruments and techniques), the AIDS virus without a single shred of scientific evidence that it causes AIDS or trans- mits any of the diseases attributed to it. The causes of AIDS, as it is now Called, have been known for at least sixty years. So, while modern drugs, which have contributed little good and much harm to patients, are widely used and touted as \"wonders\", herbs, which have stood the test of time, are largely ignored. It is not my intention to write another book on herbs. This chapter will deal only with herbal formulas that are currently considered useful in cancer and immune deficiency diseases. Keep in mind, if you decide to investigate herbs further for this purpose, that herbs which \"detoxify\" or boost the body's defenses are the ones most likely to be applicable. There is a concern that imported herbs are exposed to irradia- tion and gassing by government agencies of some countries which can alter their properties and even render them potentially harmful. The effects of irradiation or gassing on any food has not been fully investigated and is being challenged by professionals and citizen groups. I have been told that the most reliable sources are local reputable growers. I have chosen to mention herb formulas that have interesting, but sometimes sparsely documented, histories of use. The information has been gathered from books and individu- als, some of whom market the products, and from people who are using them. Because most patients I have talked to have been on therapeutic programs of one form or another, it is impossible to be able to attribute their successes to a specific remedy. I have heard many stories from apparently sincere individuals, who \"know people\" who have taken one treatment or another, and whose cancers have disappeared and were confirmed by medical exami- nation and tests. It is in this framework that I am presenting a few of the most popular herbal preparations. 124 Herbs, which are simply plants, have been used throughout recorded history and evidence exists, long before that, for the treatment of disease. Herbal medicine has been practised in every major world civilization. Approximately half of all modern phar- maceuticals are derived from herbs. Animals naturally seek out certain herbs in the self-treatment of disease. This would indicate that man learned from animals and places the beginnings of herbal medicine to a time many millions of years ago. Simple observation of primitive, inexpensive herbal treatments, as compared to the expensive and toxic pharmaceutical derivations, reveals that we would be far better off to go back in time and avoid the disaster of the modern pharmaceutical industry. It is a classic example of \"paying through the nose\" in order to get \"shafted\". 28 2K 8 2K 2K 26 OK 2 OK OK ok OK OK OK KK ALOE The aloe plant has become the source of an incredible number of commercial preparations in the form of creams, lotions, gels and shampoos. The juice of the aloe is being used for cleansing of the colon and intestinal problems. Toxicity and side effects are relatively rare and not usually severe. Almost every conceivable benefit has been claimed for aloe over the centuries. Because it is a plant, chemical analysis has revealed a host of substances, one of which has been shown in mice to have anti- leukemic activity (S. N. Kupchan, 1976). Its anti-cancer activity has been shown to indicate its action is through stimulation of scavenging white blood cells of the immune system (L. Ralamboranto, Archives of the Pasteur Institute, 1982). The many studies done by Russian scientists, have done more to establish a respectable place in modern medicine than any other group of investigators. N.V. Gribel and V. G. Pashinskii, in Vopr Onkol. 1986, showed that aloe juice reduced tumor mass and the frequency of metastases in rats. R. Berkow in the Merck Manual, wrote of aloe's ability to protect individuals with weakened immune systems against infection. 125 DEADLY DECEPTION S. Solar, publishing in the Archives of the Pasteur Institute in 1980, showed that aloe could prevent infection in mice, if used several days before exposure. J. Y. Brossat and his group, in the same journal the following year, demonstrated that aloe was effective in preventing serious infections from bacteria, parasites and even fungus. These studies give great credence to those individuals who drink aloe on a daily basis, as a protective against disease. Y. Sato wrote of aloe's protective effect on the skin against X- rays and K. Saki demonstrated its protection of the liver, particu- larly against alcohol. All of this evidence makes aloe a logical choice in health maintenance and, in particular, a cancer preventa- tive because of its obvious protection and benefits to the immune system. ASTRAGALUS Astragalus was known in the Wild, Wild West of America, as the \"locoweed\". There is no question that astragalus is an extraor- dinary booster of the immune system and is so recognized by science. In spite of this, if you ask your doctor about it, he would probably think you were talking about asparagus. | D. T. Chu in the Journal of Clinical Laboratory Immunology, 1988, demonstrated its use in cancer; and in 1986, J. Jaing showed that astragalus protected the liver of animals against the toxic effects of the common cleaning fluid, carbon tetrachloride. It has also been used to protect the liver in patients receiving chemo- therapy (Z. L. Zhang, Journal of Ethnopharmacology, 1990). Naturally, as one might expect, chemicals derived from this inexpensive weed, have been tested successfully in preventing the spread of metastases, of melanoma to the lungs in mice. M. J. Humphries reported the effect of this chemical \"swainsonine\" in Cancer Research in 1988 and J. W. Dennis confirmed its action in Cancer Research in 1990. S.A. Newton, et al., reported on the protective effects of swainsonine on the bone marrow during chemotherapy. My sug- gestion is to get \"locoweed\" and use it until scientists prove that they can do a safer and better job than nature. That means, you will see it when \"hell freezes over\". 126 MISTLETOE A commercial preparation of fermented mistletoe, known as Iscador, is widely marketed in Europe and its use has extended to some degree throughout the world. Most research has been con- ducted in Germany. Mistletoe is a folk remedy that has been advocated since the 1920's, as a therapy for cancer. It has been rejected by the American Cancer Society \u2014 of course! It is believed that a lectin labelled ML-1, which is a plant protein, stimulates the immune system by increasing white blood cells, particularly the macrophages and natural killer cells. It also increases thymus activity, thus resulting in an increased immune response (T. Hojto, et al., Cancer Research, 1989; and R. Rentea, Lab Investigations, 1981). Iscador has been found effective against lymphoma in mice and in a large study involving more than 160 patients with advanced lung cancer. These studies not only showed that Iscador stimu- lated the immune system, it directly destroyed cancer cells and prolonged survival time (G. Salzer, Oncology, 1986). Ovarian cancer responded three times better to Iscador than to standard chemotherapy involving Cytobal (W. Hassauer, et al., Onkologie, 1979). No wonder the American Cancer Society con- demned it! Other studies indicate that Iscador is not effective in kidney cancer and carcinosarcoma. It is important to note that viscumalbum, the European mistletoe, and Phoradendrom flavescens, the are both potentially poisonous; therefore, commer- cially prepared compounds are strongly advised over home made concoctions. 26 2K OK OK 8 2K OK 8 OK OB OR OK OR OK OK GLANDULAR AND NERVE TONIC: Improves ability to detoxify.

Majid Ali, M.D., is also to be noted. Various letters and articles appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 1991, which were obviously printed because of the impressive content. When the editors finally woke up to its great popularity and pos- sible impact on their monopoly of allopathic medicine, they tried to detract from the historical intelligence of these writings by attacking it as a \"marketing scheme\", and even denounced it as a hoax. So much for the integrity and purpose of American medicine's \"banner journal\". 129 DEADLY DECEPTION Ayurvedic medicine has many principles and techniques in common with Chinese medicine and with almost all schools of natural thought and practice. The articles in JAMA involved a discussion of two herbal compounds, M4 and M5 which were found to effectively reduce the incidence of breast cancer that was chemically induced in laboratory animals. These compounds were also effective in treating breast cancer. Studies done on lung cancer, metastases with M4, were also successful; and a common brain tumor, neuroblastoma, was normalized by M5. These herbal compounds contained antioxidants which explains their anti-carci- nogenic activity. CHAPARRAL This common shrub of the American South West, is usually prepared in the form of a tea. As expected, the pharmaceutical industry is again trying to out-do nature, by exploring the anti- cancer properties of what they refer to, as the active ingredient, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA). Chaparral is commonly referred to as the creosote bush. NDGA was shown by S. Birkenfeld to reduce the occurrence of colon cancer in rats, that were fed a chemical that induced that cancer. D. K. Shalini demonstrated NDGA's ability to protect genes against carcinogens and published this experiment in Molecular Cell Biochemistry, 1990. The breast cancer preventive effect of NDGA was demon- strated by D. L. McCormick and A. M. Spicer (Cancer Lett. 1987). Leukemia cell cultures were inhibited by NDGA (A. M. Miller, Journal of Laboratory Clinical Medicine, 1989) and human brain cancer cell growth were likewise inhibited by NDGA (D. E. Wil- son, Journal of Neurosurgery, 1989). Cancer cell inhibition was intensively explored in the doctoral thesis of J. Zemora (Auburn University, 1984). Regression of the deadly melanoma and treatment of choriocarcinoma and lymphosarcoma have been sited by C. R. Smart in Cancer Chemotherapy Reports, 1969, and American Can- cer Society, 1971. D. Vanden Berghe demonstrated the anti-cancer and anti-viral activity of other chaparral extracts, and P. Train wrote of its use as an anti-bacterial. 130 Naturally, NDGA is toxic to the kidney and can be deadly when combined with some biologicals (D. R. Shasky, Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 1986; and J. D. Gardner, Kidney International, 1987). Because of a rare case in which signs of liver damage showed up after several months of taking chaparral leaf, M. Katz, in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology, 1990, warned that \"the pub- lic and the medical profession must be wary of all 'harmless' non- prescription medications, whether purchased in pharmacies or elsewhere\". M. Katz, of course, did not site all the horrendous problems with the synthetic NDGA, of which, I am sure, he ap- proves. 2B OK 26 OK 2B OK 2B OK OB OK OK OK OK OB OK RK ECHINACEA The most popularized herb recommended for infections and for weakened immune systems.

CHINESE HERBAL MEDICINE Chinese medicine is based upon intensive and patient observa- tion that has been carried out through more than 4,000 years. From these observations, came philosophical concepts that have stood the test of time and are constantly verified by modern scientific discovery. The Western physician, unaware of the depth of mean- ing in the Chinese traditional philosophy, looks with disdain at their therapies and perceives them as primitive. The World Health Organization has called for a re-examination of ancient medical traditions and their assimilation into the health systems of each country. This has occurred mostly in Asian countries and in Mexico and Africa. The Chinese traditional physicians use a root called Actinidia. Its use in inhibiting liver cancer growth and other tumors, was discussed in Planta Med., 1989, by G. Franz. Chemotherapy has been combined with Rabdosia rubescens and has proven to be excellent (R. L. Wang, 1986). 131 DEADLY DECEPTION DNA synthesis is inhibited by Baohuside-1, a natural plant extract, and was, therefore, tested against various cancers by S. Y. Li, Cancer Lett., 1990. The Chinese have investigated synthetic compounds, similar to extracts from the dried body of the Chinese Blister Beetle (Mylabris). These compounds were demonstrated to be effective against liver cancer (G. S. Wang, Journal of Ethno-pharmacology, 1989). The Chinese have been noted for their traditional teas that are used as tonics. Golden Book Tea and Six Flavor Tea have proved useful in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation against lung cancer (X. Y. Liu and N. Q. Ang, 1990). Y. B. Ji tested the use of Bu Zhong Qi Wan, a pill used to stimulate body energy, along with cyclophosphamide, a chemo- therapeutic agent, and found that it decreased toxicity and en- hanced its anti-cancer activity.

Note: The above therapies are safe and supported by considerable \"anecdotal\" evidence (experience). They will not be accepted by establishment medicine until expensive double-blind studies are performed. This is the law, in spite of the fact, that the OTA. (The Office of Technological Assessment) stated in 1978 that more than 80% of the procedures and therapies currently used by the estab- lishment, have never been double-blinded! The use of any therapy that is destructive to the immune system is illogical and criminal even if the law allows it! } If you expect that any physician is going to cure you, it will be your biggest mistake. The physician can just help. Only you can do the \"curing\" by taking all of the measures listed above. Half measures will not work. Give your body the chance to do its natural job and do nothing to hinder it. Any antiviral therapy that is immune- suppressive and aimed at treating HIV is unnecessary, dangerous, unethical and bad medicine \u2014 you are already immune to HIV! WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO? The future benefits to humanity that can be derived from this horrendous experience, if the powerful forces of government do not obstruct justice, orchestrate a cover-up or perpetuate the \"big lie\", can be greater and more rewarding than any single epic in the history of humankind. The profits gained can reach far beyond the realm of science and serve all human endeavor. Freedom of thought and expression without suppression by any authority must be pro- tected. We must always be suspect and seriously question those who proclaim special powers, knowledge and cures, while discred- iting and silencing without proof all opposition with baseless accu- sation and prejudice. Establishment medicine has promised cures for seven decades; and in spite of 95% failures and an admission of defeat, it continues its false promises and claims of superiority over all other healing arts and therapies. Because of its arrogance and ignorance, it has followed a path that defied the rules of nature and, except for crises situations, it offers temporary relief at great 134 sacrifice to the maintenance of health. In AIDS, because of the Same arrogance and ignorance, it has become an accomplice to murder. Of my colleagues, I ask that we become thinkers once again, with open minds and an eagerness to learn from our rich inherit- ance. We have abandoned the path that leads to a balance with nature in favor of artificiality and harmful remedies. Let us earn and recapture the admiration of the world. Let us regain the self- respect and pride which, by virtue of the humanitarian goals that motivate most of us, we can truly deserve. This will only be possible if we raise our voices in indignation and horror at this atrocious fraud that has been perpetrated against all science and humanity. Five minutes of your time, which is all it takes to write a note to your senators and representatives in congress, will save millions of lives. Many millions more will be freed from a life of anxiety. Billions of your tax dollars will no longer be wasted. They can be used constructively to relieve suffering and truthfully educate the public in the prevention and treatment of the real \u2014 Acquired Immunedeficiency Diseases.

The level of incompetence and fraud rises at an astounding pace. Like they say, \"You ain't heard nothin' yet!\" Better still, in scientific circles they say, \"What some scientists won't do for a grant!\" And as you now know, one doesn't get a grant unless you agree with the AIDS hypothesis. The next expos\u00e9 illustrates this point very well. It comes in a close second to Gallo's original papers. A medical article was published in Nature, vol. 362, March 11, 1993. The article was entitled, \"Does Drug Use Cause AIDS?\" by M. S. Ascher, H. W. Sheppart, et al. In this article, Asher, et al., directly attack Peter Duesberg's contention that the use of drugs alone or in association with malnutrition, and the treatments that are usually given are sufficient and, in fact, necessary to cause the diseases of AIDS to occur. They, (Ascher, et al.) \"decided to assess this hypothesis\". In a graph illustration included in their article, they included a line which indicated \"HIV-positive, no drug use\" individuals. That line showed a serious decline in CD4 (T-cell) count. This indicated that being HIV-positive alone, and not drug use, was all that was necessary for AIDS to occur. There is only one problem, and I am sure that Ascher, et al., do not consider this important, but, there were no individuals included in the study that were in that category at all! It was pure fabrication. 137 DEADLY DECEPTION Peter Duesberg challenged this article in a letter to Nature, which Dr. Maxine Clarke, the Executive Editor refused to print. Duesberg stated that the study by Ascher, et al., was \"worthless for a scientific appraisal of the drug-AIDS hypothesis\". Duesberg pointed out the serious deficiencies in the article including the \"fabrication\" of results. Can you believe that scientists would fail to even mention or report whether or not AZT had been taken by the participants in a study such as this? But, of course, as we all know, if the rewards are so great, we see what we wish to see. What about the effect of AZT on those individuals who have been treated just because they were HIV-positive? Perhaps Dr. Ascher, you might ask one of your co-authors, Winklestein, about the damaging effects from the ex- tensive use of AZT in the very same area in which you did your study \u2014 he reported it! And Dr. Winklestein, how could you allow it? Oh yes, Dr. Ascher, I am sure that you are aware that AZT is toxic to the bone marrow where T-cells are formed. Are you hiding murder? Do you really wish to be an accomplice by non-disclosure of the truth? Or, is it possible that you are just not sufficiently competent for the job? Worse, is it conceivable that you would perform the study without HIV-positive drug free controls? After all, isn't that the main argument of your group, that being HIV-positive will cause AIDS without drugs? Well, Dr. Ascher, where are these HIV- positive drug free AIDS victims? Before you answer that, remem- ber that AZT is also a drug! Ascher doesn't mind insisting that drugs have nothing to do with AIDS in spite of the fact that his own data shows that 72.9% of the HIV-positive group were heavy drug users and 50.9% were light drug users. Duesberg points out that since most of the sexual contacts of this sub-group of homosexuals are drug related, the government statistics indicate a very significant set of facts. If it takes approximately 1,000 of these sexual contacts to transmit the virus, then these individuals are, therefore, likely to have consumed 1,000 doses of drugs. Hardly an insignificant amount. Even a non- scientist would conclude that drug toxicity, which has long been recognized as a cause of immune deficiency (> 60 years), is the more likely cause of AIDS. 138 Ascher's study only considered the drug consumption for a 24- month period, prior to entry into the study, but not during the 96- month follow-up. This is highly irregular and certainly unreliable as an indication of the behavior that followed. It would appear that either Ascher was determined to avoid a good epidemiological study for fear that it might not confirm a predetermined desired outcome. This, unfortunately, is typical of the AIDS scientific literature. The lack of information about the total drug intake also raises serious questions as to the time period involved in the study. Everyone knows that if you do a study on the effects of smoking on the incidence of lung cancer or of alcohol on the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver, a 24-month tabulation of use would fall far short of the incidence of these diseases. The dosage and the length of time it is used is crucial in obtaining an accurate determination of possible cause and effect. Is it possible that dedicated, learned and independent scientists could submit such fraudulent trash as this? What possibly could be the motive for damning a colleague and his important challenge to more than 40 indefensible hypotheses? Could it be the untold fortunes in royalties and the plethora of grant monies available to scientists willing to compromise ethics and morals? Dr. Peter Duesberg has recently produced a brilliant 75-page document en- titled, \"AIDS ACQUIRED BY DRUG CONSUMPTION AND OTHER NON-CONTAGIOUS RISK FACTORS\". This paper, which was printed in Pharmacology Therapeutics, Vol. 55 (1992), contains over 700 references and is worth distributing to all your friends. This courageous and dedicated scientist has placed truth before his career and all personal gain. I strongly urge that you order a copy of this reprint along with his reply to Ascher, et al.

These are not necessarily examples of fraud, they represent the fruits of arrogance, ignorance and greed: Thalidomide, which caused birth deformities, and an ever grow- ing number of drugs including AZT, which are responsible for an uncountable number of diseases and deaths; Mercurial and arseni- cal compounds \u2014 which often caused what they were supposed to cure; Legionnaire's Disease \u2014 caused by a toxin and is not conta- gious; Alzheimer's and a host of other conditions, thought to be caused by viruses, but now recognized as the result of environmen- tal toxins. The War on Cancer \u2014 the 20 billion dollar, 20-year search for a cancer virus that yielded nothing. Now we are being told that HIV can cause over thirty diseases; may cause no disease at all; can be gotten from someone without the disease; will kill you because you are immune to it; can anni- hilate humanity; take from one year to a lifetime to cause disease after infection; needs a \"co-factor\" to cause a specific disease (such as a carcinogenic to cause cancer); can be transmitted by 1 to 2,000 sexual acts; and can kill even when it is nowhere to be found. Aren't we supposed to stop believing in fairy tales at the age of ten? THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT A growing number of AIDS cases are being reported in which: I. The presence of HIV, or even the antibodies to HIV, has not been demonstrated. Il. Individuals, particularly children, have no known \"risk factors\", i.e., drug use, injections, transfusions, born of parents with AIDS, sexually active or promiscuous or 66 99 gay . Il. 5% of the population of the U.S.A., or approximately 12,500,000 Americans are purported to be HIV-positive and yet, the number of AIDS cases is proportionately dropping. 140 IV. All estimates, by the major health organizations of the world, indicate that the overwhelmingly majority of HIV-infected people are not developing AIDS. V. There are the extremely important and crucial studies analyzing and correlating the number of individuals who died from the AIDS diseases in the many decades prior to this \"new epidemic\" \u2014 there is no epidemic! 26 2K 26 2 2 6 2K 2 OK OK KOK OR OK OK OK OK NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE TREACHERY! As an interesting addition to the ongoing expos\u00e9 of the great AIDS-AZT fraud, documents of the National Cancer Institute in 1991 revealed that Maitake mushrooms were as effective in in- hibiting the growth of the so-called HIV virus, as well as the toxic killer drug, AZT. Incredibly, the National Cancer Institute con- verted the natural Maitaki extract into a sulphate and thus rendered it toxic. AZT continues to make billions for the Burroughs-Wellcome Company, while committing mass murder. Other mushroom prod- ucts have been obstructed by the FDA in spite of the fact that they have proved effective against cancer in other parts of the world. PSK, widely used throughout the world, has been blocked by the FDA. (Ralph W. Moss, Ph.D., Cancer Therapy, page 248, Equinox Press, 1992.

BK 8 2K OK 8 OK OB OB OK BOK OK BOK BR Summary of a two page spread which appeared in the Sunday Times in the United Kingdom on 3 October 1993, entitled: \"THE PLAGUE THAT NEVER WAS\" by Neville Hodgekinson In 1989 Philippe and Evelyne Krynen traveled to Tanzania on mission dedicated to helping third world orphans. They joined 141 DEADLY DECEPTION Partage, a French charity organization, and focused on their efforts in the area considered the epicentre of the AIDS epidemic. They soon headed the organization in Tanzania which now employs 230 full-time workers and many field workers. Their reports soon provoked the interest of the entire world in the AIDS catastrophe in Africa. Their information was carried by newspapers and maga- zines. They had been given the standard \"textbook\" information about AIDS and believed it was sexually transmitted, spreading rapidly, took one to two years to develop after exposure and the transmission from mother to child was 50%. Now four years later, after intensive work, investigative research and testing, their hands- on experience has revealed a totally different story. In Kagera, the area in which they concentrated, \"people were indeed dying alot, because of poverty and an upsurge in malaria.\" They decided to test everyone for AIDS and at least attempt to save the purported 50% who were not infected. Instead of finding a 50% incidence of HIV- positives, only 13.7% showed up positive, and some of those were falsely positive because of parasites and other infections. They also discovered that repeated tests turned up negative and that there was no relationship between HIV-positivity and risk of illness. \"If simply fed and treated for the real illness they had, they recovered. In all the children we have lost there was a very well designated reason, an illness we could not cope with because we hadn't the means to do it: heart failure, TB treated too late, cerebral malaria, acute hepatitis \u2014 probably caused by a drug taken for the wrong reasons. You have no right to call any of these deaths AIDS. I can't tell you of a single child I have followed who has died of a so- called AIDS-related illness.\" The occurrence of HIV-positives \"could be because being more in contact with doctors and hospi- tals, and taking more drugs, or just giving birth, causes you to accumulate reactivity to the test. It may not have anything to do with the virus.\" The World Health Organization claims that at least 8 million Africans are infected. However, in the first 10 years of the \"epi- demic\" only 200,000 have died in all of Africa, and that figure has been disputed. Medical workers in Africa state that the figures are exaggerated. The head of pathology and microbiology at the uni- versity teaching hospital at Lusaka, Dr. Nkandu Luo, insists that the disease has been over-reported. The Krynens stated, because 142 funds are available for orphans of AIDS victims, most children who have been left with their grandparents while the parents are elsewhere trying to earn a living, are presented as orphans. In addition, when a parent has died of accidents or other causes, the families will say it was AIDS, again, because funds will then be provided. \"It has always been like this here; they may need help, but it has nothing to do with AIDS. It has become a racket, both AIDS workers and false \"victims\" are making a handsome profit. Krynen points out that the \"epidemic\" started in drug dealers and \"...whatever killed them was not sexually transmitted, because (it has) not killed their partners. \"We have fewer casualties, propor- tionately, in those who test positive than in those who test nega- tive.\" The literature they now hand out states, \"It is not known whether HIV causes AIDS. It is time to return to science and abandon magic thinking.\" Thousands have not even been tested for AIDS and research articles are continuing to show that thousands of documented cases of AIDS are completely negative for the virus or its antibodies. The London Times reports that Dr. Timothy Stamps, Minister of Health and Child Welfare in Zimbabwe, states, \"\"The HIV industry, which is multi-million-dollar nationwide, is now in my view one of the biggest threats to health.\" The Krynens are fighting against telling the people that they are going to die and have noted that many individuals are getting better when they have been told there is no link between the virus and AIDS. \"It is good to know that this epidemic which was going to wipe out Africa is just a big bubble of soap...It is terrible to consider you have done so many things you thought worthwhile, when in fact you were misled. It is diffi- cult to adjust afterwards...As time passes it gets bigger and bigger...We came here to help orphans of AIDS. Now we are facing a situation where there are no orphans and no AIDS.\" \"My medical studies led me to believe that AIDS was devastating and the people who showed me the situation here reinforced this belief. I...made others believe it. And now I know it was not true. Nothing was true.\" Te 2 eo a ROR oR oR oR oR RRR RK 143 DEADLY DECEPTION AXIOMS THAT A LIFETIME OF MEDICINE TEACHES To describe a disease as having a specific cause, is as erroneous as characterizing the glorious voice of a great singer as simply a matter of vibrating vocal chords. Not even health can master incurable remedies. When justice vacates, tyranny takes up residence. The processes of life are an extreme complexity of interaction between an organism and its environment; evolving through a slow, prolonged course of adaptation and; exists only because the sum is greater than its parts, whether it be the organism itself or the substances upon which it depends for survival. What we call \"nature\" is all that is or should be. Anything else is unnatural or alien and will assuredly destroy or alter the whole. When Humans believe they can improve on nature, think more than twice; the cost is eventually immeasurable. Repair of abnormalities, that which cannot function effectively in the natural milieus, can only be effectively and fully repaired by utilizing natural medicines. Maintaining the natural relationships of life to the environment is both the prevention and the cure. That which is alien to nature cannot possibly correct what it un- doubtedly caused. Replacing but a part, can never reconstruct the whole, which is assuredly more than the sum of its parts. The only physician that has ever fully accomplished this, is a woman. We call her \"Mother Nature\". What blasphemy! The Government asks that a drug be \"safe and effective\", when in truth, only natural medicines can meet that 144 requirement, and they are removed from the shelves while poisons of one degree or another remain. Ozone, when not contaminated by humankind, is nature's way of purifying the atmosphere. In proper concentrations it kills bacteria, fungi, viruses and cancer cells. Yet, many governments say its efficacy has never been proven, and will not \"grandfather in' its use, even though it precedes government by hundreds of millions of years. Even if the whole world believed a lie, it could not make it the truth. It does however speak to the cunning of the liar and the innocence of the believer. Truth is not verified by popular vote, it avoids no question and answers without emotion. The FDA (in the U.S.A.) is the supreme authority on healing. God is still waiting for his remedies to receive approval. The problem? They have never been subject to a double-blind study, no one else in research has been able to duplicate them, and the Bible is not considered a peer-reviewed journal! (GOD offered the FDA an incentive in the form of a good job in Heaven, but withdrew the offer when he realized they were all destined to go to Hell!) If we alter or destroy the ecosystem without the time or ability to adapt, disease and death will surely follow. Character assassination in response to another scientist's chal- lenge, is tacit evidence of an indefensible position. To be pious while blaspheming another is merely a reflection of one's own character. The prime requisite of a scientist is an open mind. (The igno- rance of physicians could be forgivable, most really do not know and better.) However, to be intolerant of other schools of thought is inexcusable. Perhaps we should be reminded that eighty percent of what is done in medicine has never been double-blinded. 145 DEADLY DECEPTION Therefore... Is it Science to be cavalier about the thousands of drugs and therapies we have discarded in the past century, and perhaps as recent as yesterday, that we confidently prescribed the day before; and then, in the next breath, condemn centuries old therapies which members of the establishment have never used, though they have stood the test of time? ee ee I wrote the following article on AIDS.

Willner, M.D., Ph.D. The history of medicine contains a plethora of instances in which physicians have acted tragically under \"consensus of opin- ion\" rather than relying on substantial scientific evidence. This practice has its origins in the long-held concept that medicine is an \"art\" rather than a science. In recent decades, the major advances in technology have allowed us to emerge from the \"dark ages\" of diagnostic and therapeutic doctrines that were often based on per- sonal prejudice and \"medical politics\". Unfortunately, we have also fallen victim to fraudulent scientific papers because of the inherent trust we place in our colleagues engaged in arcane areas of medical research. In the early 1980's, physicians became aware of what appeared to be an emerging epidemic which is now known throughout the world as AIDS. Along with all of my colleagues, I eagerly followed the releases from the \"authorities\" about the progress of the disease and the involved explanations related to the behavior of the new retrovirus which was given the designation HIV. In spite of my relative ignorance about retroviruses, I became Suspicious that something was awry when retrovirologists, who had spent twenty years and in excess of twenty billion dollars in research on viruses, became involved in extensive apologetics with reference to HIV. They began to use terms such as \"mysterious\" and \"intelligent\" in the ever growing number of additional hypo- thetical explanations needed in the attempt to clear up the contra- dictions arising with reference to the original virus \u2014 AIDS HYPOTHESIS. I underscore the word hypothesis to remind my colleagues that the so-called AIDS virus has never been proven scientifically to cause any disease, let alone AIDS. Every scientific pronouncement is without laboratory proof and is mere supposi- tion. Allow me to be presumptive enough to speak on behalf of some of our most respected colleagues in the area of research on AIDS; Dr. Peter Duesberg, Professor of Molecular Biology, University of California at Berkeley, the world's foremost retrovirologist; Dr. Charles A. Thomas, Professor of Microbiology, Harvard; Dr. Kary Mullis, six-time Nobel Candidate, Nobel Laureate, 1993 and dis- coverer of the Polymer Chain Reaction. These are just a few of the hundreds of prominent scientists who have banded together to form \"The Group For The Reevaluation Of The AIDS Hypothesis\". I have spent five years in researching as many scientific papers and lay periodicals as possible in order to try to fully understand the enigma of the phenomena called AIDS. Everything I have read and verified has confirmed the suspicions which grew out of the obvi- ous contradictions of the \"hypothesis\" and the practical experience from treating AIDS victims. AIDS is not an enigma, our medical texts have clearly defined the causes of acquired immune deficien- cies for over fifty years. What appeared to be an emerging epi- demic amongst homosexuals, occurred as a result of three coincidental phenomena; the advent of the \"drug culture\" of the sixties, the use of amyl nitrite (\"poppers\") and the visibility of the \"gays\" as a group when they \"came out of the closet\". If we add two other obvious factors, starvation in Africa (long recognized as the major cause of immune deficiency) and the use of AZT, the enigma of AIDS becomes crystal clear. The \"mysterious\" and \"intelligent\" virus suddenly becomes the uneventful, ordinary, in- animate piece of dead tissue that it is. I present to you just a fraction of the facts that cry out for an immediate investigation and re-evaluation of what I now know to be the \"Deadly Deception\" \u2014 The Viral-AIDS Hypothesis. WHY HIV CANNOT CAUSE AIDS None of the proposed explanations, of which there are more than forty, as to the modus operandi of HIV, nor the virus-AIDS hypoth- esis itself, are based on scientifically acceptable evidence or proof. The available laboratory evidence speaks against the hypothesis. The remainder of the evidence is epidemiological, and even that, when scrutinized and truthfully presented without first being selec- tively screened, proves that HIV is innocent of any involvement in AIDS. EPIDEMIOLOGY We are asked to believe that a single virus is the cause of both cell-destructive diseases, i.e. Pneumocystis pneumonia, and cell- proliferative diseases, i.e. Kaposi's sarcoma! Worse, we are asked to believe that a single virus can cause two distinctly different disease complexes, and do so on the basis of geographical distribution, sexual preferences and gender. | In Africa, AIDS is virtually 100% fever, diarrhea and wasting. In the United States and Europe, AIDS is 25 to 35 distinct diseases, depending on how they are classified. There are no uniform or significant genetic differences between the isolated HIV or any of its mutants found in the U.S.A., Europe or Africa to account for the wide discrepancies in disease occur- rences. The incidence of HIV in Africa differs from one country to another and correlates only with malnutrition and starvation. Else- where it correlates with drugs, the male gender, sexual preference and crosses all national boundaries. In Europe and the United States, 86% to 90% of AIDS cases are males. In Africa, AIDS occurs evenly between the sexes. The predicted epidemic has not occurred. In the past 10 years (since 1984), 204,000 individuals in the U.S.A. have developed AIDS. 602,000 were predicted. In Africa, 129,000 have developed AIDS. 3,063,000 were predicted. If these figures were corrected for the normal incidence of all of the acquired immune deficiency diseases, as well as starvation and drugs (AZT included), none would be left to blame on HIV. The predicted AIDS epidemic in Thailand produced only 123 AIDS cases in 8 years. Laboratory rats treated with antibiotics and cortisone, both immunosuppressive, developed Pneumocystis pneumonia which is the most common disease of AIDS. In Europe and America approximately '/3 of the AIDS cases are diseases which are not truly immune deficient, i.e. Kaposi's sar- coma, lymphoma, wasting disease and dementia. 83% of American AIDS babies are \"crack babies\" (born to drug addicted mothers) or hemophiliac (congenital). In Africa, the virus has little or no affinity for sexual or behav- ioral risk groups. In spite of the ubiquitous presence of Pneumocystis and Can- dida, these diseases do not occur in AIDS in Africa. 50% of American AIDS patients are presumptively diag- nosed-without a positive test. AIDS occurs mostly in the 20 to 45 year-olds, our healthiest and armed forces-recruitable years. The virus prefers males (90%), but the diseases it supposedly causes are not male specific. THE VIRUS CALLED HIV HIV has never been present in AIDS cases in amounts large enough to cause disease, and yet it supposedly kills the victim. Only 1 virus per 100,000 lymphocytes can be found in only 20% of AIDS cases, even when death is imminent. The presence of the virus is often 40 times greater in healthy HIV-positive individuals than in fatal AIDS cases, where many times it can't be found at all. The virus cannot be found in the lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma. The virus cannot be found in the brain in dementia. In order to isolate the virus from the blood of an AIDS victim, you have to culture at least 5 million leucocytes and it may take 15 separate attempts to do so. The incidence of AIDS is '/3 lower in health care workers, caring for AIDS patients, than in the general population. AIDS hypothesis supporters claim incredulously, without any proof, that the failure of the unproven HIV to meet Koch's Postu- lates, invalidates that 100 year-old standard for etiological proof! The HIV test is for the presence of antibodies, not the virus. AIDS is the first disease in the history of medicine in which immunity indicates the patient will die of the disease! Of course, there are latent viruses which, under opportune situations of debili- tation, replicate in sufficient numbers to cause clinical infection and even death. This has never occurred with HIV, and has only been postulated and proclaimed a fact without any proof whatso- ever. The Centers For Disease Control in the U.S.A. never report the incidence of HIV in its HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report. To do so would expose the fraud. HIV correlates only 50% with AIDS. Cytomegalovirus corre- lates 100% with AIDS, as do drugs and the Epstien-Barr virus. There are also significantly higher correlations with Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, HSV, the number of blood transfusions, malnutri- tion and starvation. DISCREPANCIES ABOUND Since HIV came onto the scene the median age of hemophiliacs has increased by 5 years! The risk of AIDS in HIV-positive non-hemophiliacs is twice that of HIV-positive hemophiliacs. The incidence of AIDS in the wives of HIV-positive hemo- philiacs is 1/5 of the number predicted by the AIDS hypothesis. The incidence of AIDS hemophiliac children tripled two years after the virus was filtered out of blood transfusions. According to official statistics AIDS had not spread for 7 years \u2014 until they added 5 more diseases (1985-1992). We are constantly being warned of the coming catastrophic epidemic. Yet, there is undeniable evidence that HIV has existed for at least 50 years and probably millions of years. HIV in non-drug using prostitutes is virtually non-existent. Venereal disease and unwanted pregnancies have increased in the past 8-10 years, but not HIV. Only 1 provirus (not the virus) was found out of 1 million cells in only 1 out of 25 HIV-positive males. Statistics indicate that if you want to \"get AIDS\" from an HIV- positive male you have to be on drugs for a long time. In the U.S.A. and Africa the evidence is conclusive that there is no difference in the incidence of AIDS diseases between HIV- positive and HIV-negative babies. - If AIDS was sexually transmitted, the perinatal transmission would make it a pediatric disease \u2014 the incubation period is supposedly two years. It is not a pediatric disease. A report released by the U.S. Job Corps and the U.S. Army, which was based on millions of tests, indicated that HIV was evenly distributed between males and females in the age group from 17 to 24. However, the Center for Disease Control in the U.S.A. reports that 85% of the AIDS cases in the same age group are males. A proportionality exists between HIV and AIDS only if starva- tion, transfusions and drugs, including AZT, are involved. Other- wise, being HIV-positive is meaningless. 10% of male and female heterosexuals prefer anal intercourse. The incidence of HIV and AIDS in those women is the same as compared to women who prefer vaginal intercourse. Yet, the inci- dence of AIDS is 90% male. The AIDS virus has been demonstrated in blood samples from 50 years ago, at the same time that Masters and Johnson confirmed a high incidence of anal intercourse amongst heterosexuals. Statistics show that in Africa it has to take an average of 10,000 acts of intercourse to transmit AIDS as compared to the U.S.A. and Europe's 1,000. That's 20 times a week! HIV in vivo, when present, is rare and neutralized by antibod- ies (HIV-positive) and therefore non-infectious. In vitro (in the laboratory) they are infectious because there are no antibodies present. AIDS amongst laboratory workers is the same as the general population even though their exposure is many millions of times greater. More than a dozen co-factors have been proposed as necessary to cause AIDS along with HIV. HIV is usually not even present (80% of the time) and it is always dormant. AIDS diseases are claimed to be the result of the immune deficiency or autoimmunity caused by HIV. However four of the major diseases, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, dementia and wast- ing disease are not caused by immune deficiency. Hoffman in 1990, in defense of his theory involving auto- immunity, wrote that all of \"Duesberg's paradoxes\" could be un- derstood in the light of his (Hoffman's) \"model\" (Now there's a brilliant scientist; let's make Duesberg responsible rather than the Virus-AIDS hypothesis). The autoimmune theory of Hoffman fails to explain: Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, dementia and wasting disease; the specific diseases related to specific behavior (i.e. \"poppers\" and Kaposi's Sarcoma); the incredible differences in the types of diseases be- tween the HIV-infected groups; the bias for males; and the 80% (U.S.A.) to 98% (Africa) HIV-positives who haven't developed AIDS since 1984. One really bright group of scientists, Shaw et al., argued for the concept (never demonstrated) of the formation of antibodies against the HIV antibodies. If we accept their theory, then all viruses should cause AIDS. Gallo, whose memory lapse about having stolen Montaigner's virus, for which he was declared guilty of \"scientific misconduct\" by his peers, claims to have observed HIV killing primary T-cells. Montaigner, his \"co-discoverer\"', published a paper declaring the exact opposite the same year, 1984. Gallo without any scientific evidence and in direct contradic- tion to the 20 years of knowledge gained from the intensive and conclusive 20 billion dollar study of retroviruses during Nixon's \"war on cancer', claims that HIV retrovirus kills its host cell which it absolutely needs in order to reproduce. The conversion of RNA to DNA requires the mitosis of the host cell, not its death! The very reason that retroviruses were investigated as a prob- able cause of cancer, was their noncytocidal replication. Gallo patented a technique of indefinitely reproducing T-cells in culture and hypothesizes that the T-cell line has developed a resistance to being killed by HIV. However, this has always been basically true of every T-cell line. It is claimed that 50% of HIV infected individuals are supposed to die over a ten-year period. In Africa only 0.3% die each year which means we will have to wait 150 years for 50% to die! In the first 10 years of AIDS, the prediction for the United States and Europe was overestimated 300%. After four years of on-site intensive study, investigators in Tanzania (Phillipe and Evelyne Krynen, Directors of the Partage mission and reported by Neville Hodgekinson for the Sunday Times in the United Kingdom on 3 October 1993), state that there is no AIDS epidemic. The Annual Conversion Rate from HIV-positive to AIDS is published each year by the World Health Organization. The figures indicate that if you are HIV-positive, you chances for survival are up to 300 times better if you live in Zaire rather than in Europe or the United States of America! All claims for pathogenicity of HIV by virtue of mutation have never been observed or demonstrated and are contrary to all estab- lished facts. HIV is claimed to have unique genes and toxins that destroy nerve tissue. Again, none of these claims are substantiated or demonstrated. The RNA information, structure and function of HIV do not distinguish it from other retroviruses. The Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) which is claimed to cause \"AIDS-like\" diseases in macaques is being cited to argue support for the Virus-AIDS Hypothesis. However, SIV is only 40% similar to HIV; causes disease 15 times more effectively in 1/19 the time; does not stimulate antiviral antibodies; does not deplete T-cells; produces an entirely different spectrum of dis- eases; and only does so in laboratory macaques, and not naturally in the wild species. So much for a supposed analogy. THE REAL CAUSES OF AIDS The first edition (1952) of the Merck Manual listed the causes of acquired immune deficiencies in the order of occurrence: malnu- trition, drugs, radiation... The incidence of AIDS in Africa, which is completely different from the 25-odd diseases in Europe and the United States of America and is characterized as diarrhea, fever and wasting, correlates virtually 100% with malnutrition, starvation and para- sitic disease. The incidence of drug use, i.e. street drugs (used orally or intra- venously) of all types, amyl nitrite (poppers) and other suppressive medical drugs, particularly AZT, correlate virtu- ally 100% with the development of AIDS in Europe and the United States! These factors have been proven sufficient to cause the diseases of AIDS. HIV is a sometimes present, inno- cent bystander that has yet to be proven necessary for anything that is occurring. Research by a respected group of Australian scientists have de- clared the test for HIV as scientifically invalid. They have found that malnutrition, multiple infections, malaria, multiple sclero- sis, tuberculosis, the \"'flu'' and measles can result in a positive test. In Russia, screening with the Elisa test resulted in 30,000 positive tests. Yet, only 66 could be confirmed with the Western Blot. Imagine the medical carnage being caused when individuals, because they once had measles or the '\"'flu'', are falsely diag- nosed as having a virus which has never been proven to cause any disease, are given a drug which will kill them! The incidence of AIDS in hemophiliacs drops dramatically when the protein contaminants in the added Factor VIII is refined three times. Rare anecdotal cases of AIDS that were supposedly outside the risk groups, have been sensationalized in the press throughout the world. The cause of death was cited as AIDS due to HIV infection, but a closer look tells a different story: An 18-year-old hemophiliac, Ryan White, died of internal bleed- ing and had been treated extensively with AZT which causes AIDS (see package insert). Paul Gann, a 77-year-old blood transfusion recipient died in 1989. Although the transfusion which was given in 1982 was not demonstrated to have HIV, it was blamed for his death. Gann had a 5-vessel bypass surgery in 1982, bypass surgery again in 1983 and in 1989 was hospitalized for a fractured hip, developed pneumonia and died. How many times has this happened in virtually every doctor's practice before AIDS? Yet, his death was blamed on AIDS. Kimberly Bergalis, who supposedly contracted AIDS from her dentist during a tooth extraction (the mode of transmission was never established) was tested for HIV after the dentist disclosed he was homosexual. Kimberly was given AZT. The incidence of HIV-positives amongst the dentist's patients was 0.4%, the same as it is for all Americans! The increase in the annual death rate of American males be- tween the ages of 25 to 44 rose by 10,000 during the 1980's. They were assumed to be due to AIDS. During the same period, how- ever, the deaths from intravenous drug use rose 400%. Male homosexuals comprise 60% of American AIDS patients. One study involving 170 of them produced the following break- down of drug use, usually in multiple - 25% heroin - 10% prescription drugs - 50% Many other studies involving thousands confirm these figures. AIDS victims had twice the lifetime drug dose than HIV car- riers! When amy] nitrite (\"poppers\") was outlawed in the State of Massachusetts, the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma dropped 7-fold (700% difference). Wherever its use has been charted, the inci- dence of the disease parallels the use of the drug. This is also true of all other AIDS diseases. The incidence of multiple diseases, which usually results in the frequent use of antibiotics was as follows: gonorrhea - 80% Hepatitis B - 15% __ parasitic diarrhea - 30% AZT, A CAUSE OF AIDS AZT is toxic to all cells; it is a DNA chain terminator. An independent laboratory found AZT to be 1,000 times more toxic than shown in the studies performed by the National Institutes of Health and the manufacturer (Burroughs-Wellcome). 180,000 HIV carriers worldwide are currently taking AZT. The drug insert clearly states that AZT causes acquired immune deficiency. Studies indicate that AZT does not effect the down- ward progression of CD-4+ cells Human and animal tests indicate that AZT causes severe de- pression (potentially fatal) in the production of red and white blood cells, muscle atrophy, polymyositis, lymphomas, hepatitis, dementia, mania, ataxia, encephalopathy, seizures and impotence. It is carci- nogenic in mice. Although it is well known that disease from drug use is dose related, this fact has been largely ignored in epidemiological re- search. The only controlled study on AZT (Fischl, et al., 1987) was discontinued after 4 months, supposedly because the beneficial effects were obvious. This study is a prime example of medical corruption: The AZT group received transfusions 6 to 1 over the Con- trol group. The two groups were not matched or staged. Other \"concomitant medications\" were used. Drug sharing occurred between the AZT and placebo groups. ) The AZT group had 56 side effects and the placebo group had 31 side effects. This could only occur if the code had been broken, thus making the study useless. The code was broken the first week. The ultimate outcome of the study and others performed since, indicate that AZT actually triples disease risk. The administration of AZT adds new serious and fatal disease risks. These include serious anemias requiring life-saving transfusions, leukopenia and death (20% in 9 months on AZT). Studies clearly indicate that AZT accelerates progression to death, increases the incidence of lymphoma 3,000 % and does not prolong life. Several studies have revealed recovery of cellular immunity and general improvement when AZT was discontinued. IN SPITE OF THESE FACTS, THE FDA HAS NOT RECALLED AZT The AIDS virus has been called mysterious, intelligent, strange, not ordinary, unpredictable and inconsistent. Compared to the unpredictability of the Virus-AIDS hypothesis, the Drug-AIDS hypothesis accurately predicts drug-specific diseases distinctly to the type of drug. AIDS diseases occur in HIV-free individuals, but are simply reported under their old names instead of being called AIDS. Physicians have been victimized by less-than-scientific, self- serving researchers and politicians who mouth hypotheses as though they were truth and present half-truths which convey misleading conclusions. As a result, other scientists continue their expensive and fruitless search for \"sharks in the desert\". Meanwhile, hun- dreds of thousands, and eventually millions, will continue to die from lack of knowledge as to the true causes of AIDS and iatrogenic death from AZT. It is time for physicians to remove the \"art of medicine\" mask of protection from criticism and boldly show their faces as true scientists. We must demand an immediate re-evaluation of the Virus-AIDS hypothesis in the interest of our patients and our sacred obligation to \"above all do no harm'. Robert E.

Geea by ; a: x ot on Chapter 10 The Beginning of the End (The Needle Stick) In mid-July of 1993, I was invited to stay at a friend's home in Costa Teguise on the enchanting island of Lanzarote in the Canar- ies. Located just sixty miles off the coast of Morocco, Lanzarote is caressed continuously by gentle refreshing winds that cool the ever present tropical sun. It seemed almost destined that this volcanic paradise would provide, not only the perfect motivational setting for completing several books I had been writing, but the blending of wonderful, sincere and talented people, who together, would initiate the beginning of the end of the AIDS scam. Through an unusual circumstance, I met an brilliant woman, whose ethics, organizational talents and analytical abilities, led to a chain of events that shook all of Spain. Marisa Caceres read the nearly completed manuscript of this book and arranged for me to meet Andres Pallares, the editor of LANCELOT, the weekly newsmagazine of Lanzarote. Andres was reluctant to talk with a doctor who said that AIDS didn't exist. But, when Marisa chal- lenged him with, \"Are you at least willing to be convinced?\" he agreed. We had lunch at Playa de Famara, a magnificent beach nestled below soaring majestic cliffs. In two hours, I convinced Andres and found a special friend and an advocate of humanity. On September 25, 1993, the first of four articles appeared in LANCELOT. Marisa suggested a conference for the public, which she agreed to make possible by doing a simultaneous translation (at 163 DEADLY DECEPTION which she is truly excellent). She also spoke to an HIV-positive hemophiliac, Pedro Tocino, whom she had seen on a Spanish television program. Pedro, who had been fighting the government health establishment, because of their laxity in allowing contami- nated blood to be used in transfusions, and who had been on AZT for two years, decided to come to Arrecife, the capital of Lanzarote for the lecture. Pedro arrived on Sunday, October 10, with a manuscript of a book he had written, government papers and his medical records. The dedicated, unassuming gentle man, seemed to study me with his eyes incredulously. He found it difficult to believe after years of fighting a hard and lonely battle, there was a doctor on his side. Except for the fact that he had the mild form of hemophilia, a meaningless positive test for HIV and had been slowly poisoned by AZT, there was nothing wrong with him. On the morning of October 13, 1993, while pondering how I could effectively create a doubt in the minds of an audience that had been brain-washed by lies for ten years, I recalled a remark made by Peter Duesberg, the world renowned microbiologist. At a lecture he gave in 1989, he mentioned that he would take an injection of the HIV virus, if he could trust that it didn't contain some other ingredient. I conferred with Pedro and obtained his consent to help me with a dramatic act of truth. That evening, at the end of the lecture, in front of cameras, I stuck a hyperdermic needle into Pedro's finger, coated it thor- oughly with his blood and then stuck it deeply into mine. The pictures and the story appeared in every major newspaper in Spain. It prompted condemnation by government officials and threats of legal action. I knew that the government could not risk exposure in a court of law, but I did have concern for my life from two other sources: the pharmaceutical industry and the \"Drug Lords\". If the fraudulent studies of the Burroughs-Wellcome Com- pany came to light, the company could be bankrupted by lawsuits and its officials could be subjected to criminal charges. If addicts and potential drug users knew that it was drugs that caused AIDS, it could cost the illegal drug trade billions of dollars also. Several television stations called with requests for me to ap- pear. Marisa wisely counseled me to refuse the government-run stations, as they were controlled and would not be unbiased. We accepted the request from the independently-run Antena-3 to ap- 164 pear on the most popular morning television show in Spain, which is hosted by Pepe Navarro. Marisa agreed to go with me to Madrid in order to translate so that nothing I said would be misquoted. My appearance was negotiated by Marisa. We asked only for expenses, that the segments be live and that I could review the questions before the show. They asked that I be willing to stick my finger again with Pedro's blood on camera. We met with Pedro Navarro on October 21, the evening before the show. He was at first skeptical, but after asking extremely intelligent questions for over two hours, his interest and attitude changed to one of great concern over the facts I presented. We called Peter Duesberg at the University of California so Pepe could speak to him directly. Pepe asked him if he could send a fax giving his support to my position on the AIDS scam. The following morning, I was told that the station no longer required me to repeat the \"finger stick\" on camera. Peter Duesberg's fax and the copy of the Sunday Times of October 3, 1993, which I had brought with me was displayed on television. The front page headline \"African AIDS plague a 'myth'\", and the two page headline on pages 10 and 11, \"THE PLAGUE THAT NEVER WAS\", was viewed by mil- lions throughout Spain. The viewers telephone calls were 4 to 1 in favor of my position on the AIDS scam. While in Madrid, I was interviewed by Pronto, the most popu- lar weekly magazine, with 4,000,000 readers in Spain. The three- page article entitled, \"Robert Willner: The Virus HIV Does Not Cause AIDS\" was very favorable and honest. It contained color pictures of the now famous \"fingerstick\" and the Sunday Times headline. Offers of publication of this book have been made by companies in several countries. Conferences which will include Peter Duesberg and others are being negotiated. The story went out through \"F', the world's fourth largest news service. I am hoping this is the beginning of the end of the wholesale slaughter of thousands of unsuspecting victims of fraud and the \"The Plague That Never Was\". If necessary, I will stick my finger with HIV contaminated blood a thousand times, until this deadly scam and its perpetrators are stopped. I will continue until I com- pletely expose the \"Deadly Deception\". OE OK 2K 2 26 2 OK ROK KOK OB OK OK OK OK 165 DEADLY DECEPTION THE STAKES All of us are familiar with the parable, \"The Emperor's New Clothes\". It teaches us about honesty, especially of being truthful unto ourselves, to recognize our own intelligence, judgements and instincts. It warns us of the folly of \"going along with the crowd\" and of being dissuaded from our good senses by charlatans. It was the innocence and honesty of a young child, that couldn't be deceived by the delusion that had embraced an entire population and that finally exposed the fraud of the king's dishonest tailors. The scenario of the AIDS \"Watergate\" is similar, but far more complex. It is not a lack of honesty that allowed the deceit to pass undetected by most practising physicians. It was probably an un- discriminating trust of our research colleagues engaged in the arcane study of retroviruses, about which most of us have only a rudimentary knowledge. Our gullibility and vulnerability was in- creased by our desire to benefit our patients, as well as our profes- sional and national pride. As for our colleagues in the field of retrovirology, some could have conceivably lacked the necessary knowledge and simply relied upon what they read in their journals. But, as you will learn, many went along out of fear, personal gain, or both. Admittedly, in real life, deception is sometimes more easily accomplished, but much more difficult to expose when perpetrated by individuals possessing highly specialized knowl- edge and a position of authority. This is especially true when it deals with the difficult subject of proving cause and effect in a highly specialized field in science. It is even difficult for other Scientists in allied fields to be aware that a scam is being commit- ted. The king's dishonest tailors of the story have, in real life, been replaced by a small group composed of a few research retrovirologists, pharmaceutical entrepreneurs, physicians, and high government officials. The spoils remain the same: dishonestly earned profit, power, and fame. The cost to the victims is not the embarrassment and shame experienced by the populace in the story. In real life the unimag- inable and incalculable price has been, and remains, unwarranted fear, human debilitation, degradation and genocide. The victims of 166 the deceit include those suffering from the real causes of AIDS, i.e. malnutrition, starvation and drug abuse, as well as hemophiliac children and the sufferers of at least twenty-five other diseases (and that number is growing yearly). In all of these instances, a benign virus has been falsely implicated even though not one shred of scientific evidence exists to prove it. Also affected are entire sub- groups of our population based on ethnic origin, color, sexual orientation and even social or \"anti-social\" life-styles. Tragically, this hoax deprives all individuals who are found to be HIV-positive of the true benign nature of its meaning with reference to the virus itself. Therefore, they are denied proper treatment and subjected to iatrogenic (medically caused) illness and death. The psychological impact is so incredibly profound that many victims of this fraud have committed suicide or given up hope, and thus succumbed to a disease they may have otherwise rather easily conquered. The protagonist is no longer the innocent child that awakened the minds of the people and their king. He has been replaced by the world's most respected and knowledgeable retrovirologist. Armed with reason, irrefutable facts and an unswerving selfless dedication to truth and humanity, Dr. Peter Deusberg has exposed this mon- strous fraud. The price to the scientific community is loss of credibility, loss of countless billions of dollars in misdirected and fruitless research, and undeserved honors and profits to despicable scoundrels and murderers. We have tolerated, by our lack of scrutiny and diligent application of our scientific criteria, the suppression of indepen- dent scientific thought and investigation. We have permitted the persecution and humiliation of some of our best and bravest col- leagues. Like the king's subjects in the story, we have allowed our minds to be enslaved. For us it is a much greater fault. Because of our professional responsibility and training, it is our obligation to be constantly questioning and asking for verification of all con- cepts and claims. In this we have failed. We are forced to bear some of the guilt for the deception of the public, and our religious and political leaders. The cost to the people is the deprivation of their constitutional rights of \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\". 167 DEADLY DECEPTION LOSS OF LIFE Death is occurring from misdirected research and the conse- quent application of incorrect treatment and the delay in applying appropriate treatment. LOSS OF LIBERTY The fear engendered by this imaginary, artificially constructed \"epidemic\" and its supposed cause, has fostered prejudice and panic. This has wrought a reaction of violence and has isolated entire segments of our population. Fear, as it usually does, prompts us to relinquish our rights. There are already attempts by govern- ment to impose mandatory testing and the consequent restrictions that would be, and in some cases, already have been, imposed on individuals with HIV and AIDS. THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS This is perhaps the most tragic aspect of this fraud. The diag- nosis of being HIV positive, or, of having AIDS, implies that it is incurable, was transmitted sexually, or contracted through needles and by transfusion. It places the individual in a \"prison\" of the mind. The victim lives constantly in the shadow of death, the despair of hopelessness and the pain of isolation. It is the ultimate paralyzer and impediment to the pursuit of happiness. Indeed, as in any tragedy, one can always find some redeeming benefits, not from the perpetrators of the crime, but from the community at large and from the lessons to be learned. It has brought out the humanity in many of us, in that over sixteen thousand organizations have been formed to help our fellow hu- mans. Most of these people are honest and altruistically motivated. It has served to educate us and open a dialogue on issues of morals, health, religious compassion, sexual orientation and the role that government should or should not play in all of this. Perhaps it has also made us aware of our prejudices and our impulsive willingness to cast blame and the first stone at the innocent. It has also exposed the intolerance of those depraved individuals who, masquerading under the guise of \"Godliness\", denigrate the love and compassion 168 of God by attributing the horrors of AIDS to his vengeance. We hopefully will learn to be more vigilant, so that we never again fall victim to ignorance, prejudice, perverted political and religious agendas and unscientific scams. 28 2K 2K OK 8 2K 2K 2K KOK OK OK OK OK OK RK 169 SW .compegcey ett of AIS wichita dus Fa itty Sori ame iyi > r 4st . abe ap AT aR bags Nelle f i tlt Fier ; . re 1% - ?

OE 8 OK OK 2 OK KOK OR OR OK OK OK OR OR KK In Europe and the United States, 86% to 90% of AIDS cases are males (The virus is chauvinistic). Studies in Africa and England indicate that prostitutes don' t get AIDS (The virus has high moral standards). In Africa, AIDS occurs evenly between the sexes (The virus believes in equal rights for women). AIDS occurs mostly in the 20 to 45-year-olds, the healthiest and recruitable years for the armed services (I think the virus is trying for a Nobel Peace Prize). In Europe and America approximately '/3 of the AIDS cases are diseases which are not immune deficient i.e. Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, wasting disease and dementia (The virus is diversify- ing in case immunity goes out of style). In Africa, AIDS is almost 100% fever, diarrhea and wasting, but in the rest of the world it is approximately 25 different diseases (The virus does not believe in equal opportunity). 171 DEADLY DECEPTION The presence of the virus is often 40 times greater in healthy HIV- positive individuals than in fatal AIDS cases (Deserting sinking ships? - The dirty rat! But, perhaps it prefers long term friend- ships). 83% of American AIDS babies are either hemophiliac bleeders] or \"crack babies\" [born to drug addicted mothers] (The virus is an addicted vampire)! In Africa, the virus has little or no affinity for sexual or behavioral risk groups (The virus must be puritanical. Perhaps apartheid is responsible). The predicted AIDS epidemic in Thailand produced only 123 AIDS cases in 8 years (They gave an epidemic and nobody showed up; or perhaps the virus was Thai-erred). 50% of American AIDS patients are presumptively diagnosed without a positive test (Medicine is producing a new film called Presumed Guilty). The virus prefers males [90%], but the diseases it supposedly causes are not male specific (Maybe they are unisex). The virus has never been present in AIDS cases in amounts great enough to cause disease and yet it supposedly kills people (Per- haps it's Sylvester Stallone or maybe Arnold Schwarzenegger). Most of the time, the virus can't be found in patients with AIDS (It's invisible). The virus cannot be found in the lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (It never heard the song \"I've Got You Under My Skin'). The virus cannot be found in the brain in dementia (It works by mental telepathy). In order to isolate the virus you have to culture at least 5 million leucocytes and it may take 15 tries (It ain't a cultured virus \u2014 it ain't even common). 172 The incidence of AIDS is '/3 lower in health care workers caring for AIDS patients than in the general population (The answer to AIDS \u2014 go to medical school)! Laboratory rats treated with antibiotics and cortisone, both immu- nosuppressive, developed pneumocystis pneumonia which is the most common disease of AIDS (Imposters! How dare they! Gallo will sue for misrepresentation). AIDS hypothesis supporters say that the failure of the unproven HIV to meet Koch's Postulates, invalidates that 100-year-old stan- dard for proof of causation (Huh? \u2014 yes, guesses are right and proof is wrong; black is white and...). The HIV test is for antibodies \u2014 that means the immune system is working (Great! Let's pack our bags and go home! Sorry, Dr. Gallo, I forgot your bank account isn't full yet). The Centers For Disease Control in the U.S.A. never report the incidence of HIV in its HIV/AIDS Surveillance Reports (Hmmm! Maybe the virus or somebody else paid them off!). The correlations between HIV and AIDS deals mainly with anti- bodies and not the virus, and is detected by a worthless test (Whoops! Let's just flip a coin). HIV correlates 50% with AIDS. Cytomegalovirus correlates 100% with AIDS, as do drugs and the Epstien-Barr Virus. There are also significantly higher correlations with Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, HSV, the Number of blood transfusions, malnutrition and starvation (Aha! I know, the BUTLER did it!). Since HIV came onto the scene the median age of hemophiliacs has increased by 5 years (Hemophilia is a cure for AIDS?). The risk of AIDS in HIV-positive non-hemophiliacs is twice that of HIV-positive hemophiliacs (Let's find a way to give every- body hemophilia). The incidence of AIDS in the wives of HIV-positive hemophiliacs is '/5 of the number predicted by the AIDS hypothesis (marrying a hemophiliac gives 80% protection from AIDS (Perhaps we should consider breeding hemophiliacs). 173 DEADLY DECEPTION According to official statistics AIDS has not spread for 7 years (Will somebody let it know there is supposed to be an epidemic?). We are constantly being warned of the coming catastrophe. Yet there is evidence that HIV has existed for millions of years (Don't worry, it's coming, it's coming, it's...). HIV in non-drug using prostitutes is almost non-existent (Now there's an interesting alternative to condoms!). Venereal disease and unwanted pregnancies have increased in the past 8-10 years, but not HIV (Get with it, HIV, or you will ruin your reputation). , Only 1 provirus (not the virus) was found out of 1 million cells in only 1 out of 25 HIV-positive males (WOW! Call out the army, we're being invaded by \"'The Lone Bunny Rabbit'). Statistics indicate that if you want to get AIDS from an HIV- positive male, you have to be on drugs for a long time (Start immediately girls, there's no time to waste). In the U.S.A. and Africa the evidence is conclusive that there is no difference in the incidence of AIDS diseases between HIV-positive and HIV-negative babies (What do babies know anyway?). If AIDS were sexually transmitted, the perinatal (related to preg- nancy) transmission would make it a pediatric disease. It is not (Children these days simply won't listen). A report released by the U.S. Job Corps and the U.S. Army, which was based on millions of tests, indicated that HIV was evenly distributed between males and females in the age group from 17 to 24. The Center for Disease Control reports that 85% of the AIDS cases in the same age group are males (Maybe it has something to do with hormones. Sex change operation anyone?). A proportionality exists between HIV and AIDS only if starvation, transfusions and drugs (including AZT), are involved. Otherwise HIV is meaningless (There I go again, confusing the issue with facts). 174 10% of male and female heterosexuals prefer anal intercourse. The incidence of HIV and AIDS in those women is the same as compared to women who prefer vaginal intercourse. Yet, the inci- dence of AIDS is 90% male (Maybe HIV doesn't know which end is up, or perhaps it's the virus that's gay). The incidence of HIV in Africa differs from one country to another and correlates with malnutrition and starvation, not gender or sexual preference (Now there's food for thought). Statistics show that in Africa it has to take an average of 10,000 acts of intercourse to transmit AIDS as compared to the U.S.A. and Europe's 1,000. That's an average of 22 times a week! Some must be doing it at least a hundred times a week (Maybe it's all propaganda). HIV in vivo (in humans), when present, are rare, neutralized by antibodies (HIV-positive) and therefore non-infectious. In vitro (in the laboratory) they are infectious because there are no antibodies present. AIDS amongst laboratory workers is the same as the general population even though their exposure is a million times greater (They must wear condoms in the laboratory. Now that's what I call respect for science). More than a dozen co-factors have been proposed as necessary to cause AIDS along with HIV which is either not there or sleeping (Typical of a government agent even if it is a virus). AIDS diseases are claimed to be the result of the immune defi- ciency or autoimmunity caused by HIV. However four of the major diseases, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, dementia and wasting dis- ease are not caused by immune deficiency. (Well, if Koch's pos- tulates are old-fashioned, maybe the rest of our science should be scrapped too! After all, there's big money to be made from AIDS). Hoffman, in 1990, in defense of his theory involving autoimmu- nity, wrote that all of \"Duesberg's paradoxes\" could be understood in the light of his (Hoffman's) \"model\" (Now there's a brilliant scientist, make Duesberg responsible rather than the para- doxes of AIDS-Virus hypothesis). 175 DEADLY DECEPTION The autoimmune theory of Hoffman fails to explain: the four diseases above, the specific diseases related to specific behavior (i.e. \"poppers\" and Kaposi's sarcoma), the incredible differences between the HIV-infected groups, the bias for males, the 80% (U.S.A.) to 98% (Africa) HIV-positives who haven't developed AIDS since 1984 (Technicalities, always technicalities). One really \"bright\" or \"bought\" group of scientists, Shaw et al., argued (theory) for the formation of antibodies against the HIV antibodies. If we accept their theory, then all viruses should cause AIDS (Would somebody please check what they've been smoking?). Gallo, whose memory lapse about having stolen Montaigner's virus, was declared guilty of \"scientific misconduct\" by his peers, claims to having observed HIV killing primary T-cells. Montaigner his \"co-discoverer\" wrote a paper declaring the exact opposite the same year, 1984 (Quiz: Who do you think is lying?). Gallo, without any evidence and in direct contradiction to the 20 years of knowledge gained from the intensive and conclusive study of retroviruses by many scientists, claims that HIV kills its host cell \u2014 upon which it depends for reproduction (Hark, ye husbands of childless women, there is yet hope. Kill thy mate and offspring shall abound). The AIDS virus has been called mysterious, intelligent, strange, not ordinary, unpredictable and inconsistent (How about fraud?). 3K OK 28 2K 2K 2K OK 2 2K OK OK 2 OK OK OK OK 176 Chapter 11 A Helping Hand PROFESSIONAL RESOURCES The following is a list of comprehensive practitioners of complementary and alternative therapies and chelation.

Many of the world's most prominent researchers have raised serious questions as to its cause, treatment and research difficulties. It appears that the epidemic may have nothing to do with a virus, but is, in reality, an expression of excessive drug use, both medically and illegally in the \"street\". Please read the enclosed paper which documents the major discrepancies and distortions upon which the hypothesis is based. Drs. Peter Duesberg (U. of Cal., Berkeley) and Charles A. Thomas, Jr. (Harvard) head a group of over five hundred scientists who are demanding a re-evaluation. Officials in government agen- cies, who have a substantial financial interest in AIDS testing, have used the most disgraceful tactics to prevent an investigation into this matter. If the suspicions are true, and the evidence is over- whelming, many billions of dollars are being wasted and many individuals will die from inappropriate treatment.

Evi- dence has been presented by leading scientists that: AIDS is not caused by a virus, but by malnutrition and drugs; the drug, AZT, was fraudulently released for use and is hastening death; the AIDS test is completely invalid. The serious implications demand a thor- ough investigation. Sincerely, 2B OK OB 2K OK OB 8 OK KOK OR OK OK OR OK OR The following pages contain a letter to my colleagues in the practice of medicine.

There are letters to President Clinton and to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who headed the health reform task force.

SUITE 1503 BOCA RATON, FL 33431 1994 Dear Colleague, It is my firm belief that most physicians, like myself, entered the field of medicine because of an intense desire to spend our lives in a meaningful and gratifying endeavor. I perceived medicine as a profession of science, compassion, and dignity, which would bring the honestly earned rewards of respect, honor and a relatively comfortable life. I believed that it was a profession that fostered independent thought, creativeness and innovation, deeply rooted in integrity. I naively trusted that medicine rose above avarice, poli- tics, fraud and vindictiveness. During the thirty-five years that I practised medicine, I have been privileged to work with many dedicated physicians and was honored by the opportunity to serve the profession as lecturer, president of medical associations, soci- eties, boards and hospital staffs. I made the decision to leave practice, so I could write, do research, actively fight for informed freedom of choice for patients, I wished also to help achieve for physicians, the freedom to include in the practice of medicine, homeopathics, herbs, vitamins and supplements in the prevention and treatment of disease. The politi- cal forces or organized medicine are disgracing our profession by dishonorable and unethical tactics aimed at the thousands of phy- Sicians who are repulsed by the many dangerous and ineffective drugs fostered on us by an unholy alliance with the pharmaceutical industry. More patient visits were made to practitioners of alterna- tive therapies last year, than to medical family physicians. The reason: the public is disillusioned and disappointed in our ability to treat them. Their thought processes are not hindered by the intense beliefs brought about by our allopathic indoctrination. Many of us believe that ours is the only way, that we are at the cutting edge of science. Have we lost the ability to think with an open mind as a Scientist should? Have we become so arrogant that we denounce even those things about which we have little or no knowledge? TEL: (407) 750-0428 / FAX: (407) 394-2336 I, like many of you, have seen incredible advances in technol- ogy. The medical profession excels in it genius in dealing with emergency and surgical problems. It may astound you to know, that when dealing with the remaining ninety percent of medical problems, we are largely ineffective. In claiming sole rights to so- called state-of-the-art science, we conveniently ignore the fact that more than eighty percent of our therapies have never been double- blinded. Yet we deny to our colleagues the right to practise treat- ments that were used by Hippocrates and the physicians of the East, which have persisted for thousands of years. We have been denied access and exposure to these therapies because \"they have not been proven\". Because of this hypocrisy and self-imposed imprisonment of the mind, our patients suffer and we are denied the gratification of providing successful care. For many of us, this was the main reason we became doctors! Unfortunately, we have seen the growth of stifling bureaucracy and control, often from within our own ranks or imposed by government. The inevitable consequences of such circumstances are the loss of freedom of thought and creativity, the suppression of innovation or the tyranny of a few whose beliefs seek to hold us hostage. This, in turn, reaps even greater evils; the opportunity by the establishment to perpetrate fraud with impunity, resist inspec- tion, defy challenge and reverse progress. A travesty of science and medicine has occurred in the past decade, of such dimension and incredulity, that your first impulse will be to dismiss any and all criticism. This indeed, was the belief of its perpetrators and thus far, they have succeeded. Because of the inherent trust that we place in our fellow scientists, we were easily led down a deceptive path because it was decorated with the primrose flowers of arcane scientific jargon with which many of us may not have been adequately familiar. Such is the case with AIDS \u2014 the so-called \"Epidemic of the Century\". Please read Deadly Deception (Why Sex And The Virus Absolutely Do Not Cause AIDS). It is fully referenced, factual and will astonish you. I implore you, do not dismiss this as something that will not be changed by your input. The names of the individuals, who seri- ously question the HIV-AIDS theories, read like a \"Who's Who\" in science. They include: Dr. Peter H. Duesberg, Professor of Molecular Biology, Uni- versity of California, Berkeley, CA; international authority on retroviruses; member of the National Academy of Sciences and recipient of its highest honor; Dr. Charles A. Thomas, Jr., Harvard Biologist, founder of The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypoth- esis; Dr. Kary Mullis, Biochemist; 1993 Nobel Laureate, inventor of PCR, the Polymerase Chain Reaction, which is the most accu- rate measure of the presence of viruses; Dr. Robert Root-Bernstein, Professor of Physiology, Michigan State University, leading authority on AIDS; Dr. Gordon Steward, Emeritus Professor of Public Health, University of Glasgow, World Health Organization consultant on communicable diseases, Dr. Joseph Sonnabend, pioneer AIDS researcher, founder of the AIDS Medical Foundation \u2014 and many more! At this writing, the number of prominent scientists exceed five hundred. The reputation of American medicine has been placed in great jeopardy by dishonest and greedy scientists who wield aston- ishing power because they have linked very influential government agencies into their fraud. We in medicine have been deprived of an unbiased forum because the detractors have been denied access to medical meetings. It is now up to physicians and their patients to demand a complete and open investigation by the Congress of the United States, so that the opposition can be heard. This action will serve to exonerate medicine from complicity in this contemptible affair. Your respectful colleague, Robert E. Willner, M.D., Ph.D. ROBERT E. WILLNER, M.D., Ph.D. The Editor The TIMES 1 Pennington Street London El 9XN United Kingdom 20 August 1993 Dear Sir, On August 10, an interview with Dr. Michael Merson, Execu- tive Director of the World Health Organization's program on AIDS, made many statements attributed to him which are misleading and false. Without repeating all of Dr. Merson's comments, my re- marks of fact will make obvious the issues which I am contradict- ing. 1. 2 Si In spite of the 60,000 papers that have been written about the 25 diseases which have been lumped under the AIDS umbrella, not one is a \"reference paper\" (one which proves the hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS). The major causes of Acquired Immune Deficiencies (Syn- drome) have been listed in principal medical texts for over 60 years. They are: Starvation and malnutrition (Africa); Drugs \u2014 both illicit and medical i.e. cocaine, heroin, marijuana, AZT, amyl nitrite (\"poppers\"), chemo- therapy etc. (mostly in Europe, USA and other indus- trialized nations). Radiation \u2014 medical, industrial and environmental. These causes correspond 100% with the differences and etiological circumstances present in each country on the globe. HIV (the virus that supposedly causes AIDS) is found in only 20% of the cases of AIDS, and never, even in patients on the brink of death, in amounts sufficient to cause disease. 231 DEADLY DECEPTION wy The epidemic had failed to materialize, and did not increase until 5 more diseases were added. Still, it has never met the predictions that have been made. With world-wide reces- sion, the numbers will likely expand due to increases mal- nutrition and starvation in Africa and drug use everywhere else as a response to despair, and the medical administra- tion of AZT (which causes AIDS - see drug insert). In view of the fact that it takes an average of 1,000 acts of intercourse to transmit the virus (if one still insists in be- lieving an unproven hypothesis), it is etiologically impos- sible to have an epidemic with those statistics. Dr. Merson states that the debate about whether HIV causes AIDS was pointless and unhelpful and then is quoted as saying \"There is no question that people with AIDS are people who are infected with HIV\". Not only are his facts a blatant lie, but he is ignoring the truth that some of the most prominent scientists in the world, including Dr. Peter Duesberg, the world's #1 virologist, who not only question that HIV causes AIDS, but emphatically state that it cannot! Dr. Merson continues, \"Continuing to doubt that HIV is the cause of AIDS or that it spreads through sexual intercourse, homosexual and heterosexual, feeds the denial and compla- cency that have hampered our global efforts.\" I would suggest and emphasize that the worst scientists are those who; a. b. Accept an hypothesis that has not been proven and practice science by popular vote. Refuse to re-evaluate their position in the light of the hun- dreds of contradictions evidenced by fact and the discrep- ancies that constantly arise with reference to an hypothesis originally put forth by virologist, Robert Gallo, whose pa- pers on the hypothesis have been declared fraudulent and who has admitted to taking the credit away from another scientist. That dispute had to be settled quietly by the Presidents of the USA and France. But, as Dr. Duesberg puts it, it was merely an argument as to \"who stole the fake diamonds\". 232 c. Continue to spend billions in searching for a vaccine that is unnecessary. The purpose of a vaccine is to stimulate the production of antibodies and the \"AIDS test\" is based on the fact that antibodies are present, thus we are seeking to produce what we already have! In other words, AIDS is the first disease in the history of medicine in which immunity means you are going to die from it! d. Malign and hurl epithets at those respected, brilliant and trustworthy scientists who, at great risk and without any possible gain for themselves seek only adherence to sound and time-tested scientific demands of proof and logic. I would like to remind Dr. Merson, that a true scientist would welcome the opportunity to resolve intelligently, with the incred- ible scientific techniques and tools available, the serious plethora of evidence raised by scientists of great standing and reputation. Drs. Peter Duesberg (Berkeley), Charles A. Thomas (Harvard), Kary Mullis (Nobel Prize contender), Gordon Stewart (British epidemiologist, World Health Organization) Joseph Sonnabend (founder, Aids Medical Foundation) and Harvey Bialy (Editor, Bio/Technology), are just a few of the hundreds to whom I refer. Might I also suggest to the honorable Dr. Merson that, if he reviews the scientific literature, he will find that the evidence implicating HIV as the culprit in AIDS is circumstantial and extremely poor at best. It could not be convicted in a court of law and certainly not in a court of science. In the interests of science and humanity, why does he insist on name-calling instead of a fair trial? The incredible truth is that the Gallo's and the Merson's of science, either by intent or ignorance, are now responsible for the greatest crime of all time: Millions are dying and will die because attention is drawn away from the real causes, i.e. drugs, starvation and AZT! I respectfully ask that The Times review the many articles that have been printed over the past five years. You will find that the advocates of the AIDS hypothesis offer mostly opinions in the form of \"we believe\", \"we suspect\", \"it appears\" and \"we think\". Those that disagree present the facts which demonstrate the absurd and untenable proposition of the AIDS hypothesis. It is my plea that you take a courageous journalistic lead in demanding a public 233 DEADLY DECEPTION forum in the interests of humankind, whom you strive to serve. Let the TIMES print an ongoing dialog of fact, not opinion, between the adversaries. Ask Dr. Duesberg on the one hand, and Drs. Gallo or Merson on the other, to represent the opposing groups. When the facts have been brought to light and the incredibly wild specula- tions have been exposed and disposed of, it is my profound belief the public will be a better jury in determining the truth than scien- tists who have a vested interest in perpetuating this outrageous criminal scandal. It is my bet that Gallo and Merson will refuse. They will avoid the risk of exposure with the usual excuse of the guilty. They are public servants and the public must demand their compliance! Respectfully, Robert E. Willner, M.D., Ph.D. Be ee ee ee ROBERT E. WILLNER, M.D., Ph.D. The Editor The TIMES 1 Pennington Street London El 9XN United Kingdom 7 August 1993 Dear Sir, It was with great admiration for your long tradition of honest, courageous and comprehensive reporting that I read your banner headline of 1 August 1993; \"New doubts over AIDS infection as HIV test declared invalid\". It is fitting that The Times be one of the few newspapers in the world to report the unfolding of the worst scientific scam in medical history. The so-called AIDS epidemic has never materialized because it is nothing more than what was Originally twenty diseases that has now been expanded to twenty- five diseases. If it is intended to continue to dupe the public they will soon include all known diseases and it can then be said that everyone is dying of AIDS. 234 In fact, for the past six decades the causes of Acquired Immune Deficiency Diseases has appeared in most authoritative medical texts. If I may paraphrase the ubiquitous and respected Merck Manual (1952 edition), the causes cited are: Malnutrition, drugs (medical and illicit), radiation, chemotherapy and toxic chemi- cals. This clearly explains why AIDS is so many diseases in Europe and the USA and only three symptoms in the third world countries of Africa, Haiti, etc. The primary cause of AIDS is the abuse of illicit drugs in affluent countries and malnutrition in those that are poor. This is the only logical and sane explanation for the apparent contradiction of the statistics confirmed by every authoritative agency in the world, including the UK, USA and the World Health Organization. I refer to the \"annual conversion rate\", which tallies the risk of developing AIDS if one is HIV positive. According to the figures, an individual who is HIV positive and lives in the USA or Europe, stands a ten times better chance of survival if they move to Haiti and a twenty-times better chance of survival if they move to Zaire! The reason for this, is, of course, that people in Haiti and Zaire cannot afford drugs. Malnutrition takes a longer time to destroy the immune system than do drugs. A reference paper, that which establishes an hypothesis as proven, does not exist for the AIDS hypothesis. I will gladly pay $1,000.00 to anyone who can produce just one. I have spent more than a year in diligent research in writing Deadly Deception which is completely backed by scientific articles. Of the more than sixty thousand AIDS-related papers that have been produced in the past eight years (there is a lot of grant money available), not one establishes HIV as the cause of AIDS! The original hypotheses is so untenable, that at least forty more have been formulated in an attempt to explain all its discrepancies and contradictions. One brilliant comment by Dr. Robert Gallo, the man who admittedly usurped credit for the discovery of HIV and whose original papers on which the hypothesis is based, and have been declared fraudulent, was to claim that HIV was \"an intelligent and mysterious virus\". It would have to be, how else could it know whether you were white or black, living at home in Zaire or working in the United States with a permit? It is virtually impossible to have an epidemic from sexual transmission of a disease, when it takes from between five hundred 235 DEADLY DECEPTION to a thousand acts of intercourse to supposedly pass it on. This could be considered an extremely remote possibility if you first proved that the virus caused anything at all. I could go on with scores of contradictions and fantasies on which the AIDS hypoth- esis is based, but you would have to reprint my manuscript which will be published shortly. Meanwhile, your excellent journalism will help focus attention on the real causes of AIDS, and thus save millions of lives by alerting the world of the true causes and the obvious solutions for the AIDS problem.

WILLNER, M.D., Ph.D. President Bill Clinton The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear Mr. President, Date More than one hundred of the world's most prominent scien- tists headed by Dr. Charles A. Thomas, Professor of Microbiology at Harvard University, have formed The Group for the Re-evalua- tion of the AIDS Hypothesis. This group of respected scientists have been denied access to advertising in the press and some of its members, highly honored in the field of research, have not had their grants renewed. Evidence is mounting that the so-called AIDS virus has nothing at all to do with AIDS. There is strong evidence that Dr. Robert Gallo of the NIH, who falsely claimed credit for discovery of the virus and who was responsible for it being named as the AIDS virus, has done so without one iota of scientific proof. The cost of what may be the greatest medical scandal in history, is not only countless billions of dollars lost in misdirected research, 236 it diverts attention away from the known causes of acquired im- mune deficiencies (see the Merck Manual \u2014 the doctor's \"bible''): Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is caused by many known proven factors: in particular, recreational drugs, medical drugs, polluting toxins, radiation, diet and cigarettes \u2014 either alone or in combination. By diverting attention away from the established causes of AIDS, the objectives that you and V.P. Al Gore have targeted, will be deeply undermined. Enclosed is the manuscript of a book which I have submitted for publication. It is a completely documented expose of what is, without question, criminal fraud. The corruption in the scientific and medical private sectors and branches of government is a major factor in our national debt. I extend my most profound wishes for success in your gallant endeavors on behalf of our country. I would be honored to help and serve in any way I can. Respectfully, Robert E.

Dear Madam Chairperson, Date There are extremely important and necessary steps to reduce the exorbitant costs, ineffectiveness and inefficiency of our health care system which is the single greatest contributing factor to our economic problems and the rising budget deficit. Very little benefit is derived from the incredible amount spent as compared to most countries in the world and the quality is appreciably lower. I wish to bring to your attention factors which are being ignored because of the influence of the medical establishment. 237 DEADLY DECEPTION The following are key steps that must be taken: 1. Stress preventive \"medicine\", in particular the natural means of preventing disease (minimal cost). 2. Eliminate the establishment medical monopoly which by its arrogance, ignorance and political influence, holds a stranglehold on scientific thought, theory and practice. Homeopathics, herbs, vitamins and supplements are being unfairly removed from public use by the unprincipled ac- tion of the FDA, which clearly favors the largest pharma- ceutical companies. The requirements of the FDA and allopathic doctrine are so absurd that they cannot be finan- cially met by most companies of lesser size and certainly not by the individual practitioner. 3. Put an end to the harassment of medical physicians and others who advocate non-drug therapies and have long educated their patients in wellness. As a medical doctor who over a thirty-year-period made a gradual transition in favor of alternative (natural or Hippocratic) therapies, I can attest to their effectiveness, safety and cost effectiveness. These techniques, for example, are solely responsible for the only successful reported AIDS \"cures\". Many physi- cians who refuse to adhere to the \"accepted\" use of danger- ous drugs such as AZT, which actually causes AIDS (see package insert), and use instead safe, natural and effective methods, have been subjected to administrative hearings resulting in a suspension of their licenses to practice. The establishment uses smear tactics, labels and the use of administrative hearings, controlled by them, to silence dis- senting voices. This results in the suppression of effective alternative therapies in the management of disease. The FDA requires \"double blind\" proof of centuries old natural therapies while eighty percent of allopathic medical prac- tices have never been double-blinded and are allowed. 4. Eliminate the hundreds of common, expensive and ineffec- tive procedures frequently utilized because they are \"the only thing available\" according to \"orthodox medicine\". 238 Any commission appointed to review efficacy must not be self-serving, and therefore should include physicians who have challenged the \"sacred cows\" of the establishment in the past. Many have fine reputations and have been mem- bers of respected institutions. . Put an end to the corruption in the FDA which consistently removes from public access all effective natural therapies. This increases medical costs by forcing the use of danger- ous drugs which can only be obtained by prescription and results in greater hospital use. This despicable situation is best exemplified by the removal of the essential amino acid, Tryptophan, from store shelves because of a contaminated batch imported from Japan. The FDA has not returned the uncontaminated product to the shelves. Tryptophan is a natural required amino acid of the body which is obtained from many foods, notably milk and tuna fish. It has long been known to promote healthy natural sleep. Tens of thousands of individuals who used this natural, non-addic- tive product are now forced to spend money at a physicians office in order to spend even more for an addictive drug in order to get a good nights' sleep. Compare the action of the FDA when a batch of Tylenol was contaminated: only the contaminated batch was removed from the shelves. The ineptness and corruption is obvious. Surely the FDA was aware that Tryptophan itself (an essential amino acid) can- not be toxic to the body. After millions of bottles have been sold over many years, the sudden appearance of a toxic reaction could only have been caused by contamination of a specific batch. . Grant an equal voice and public access to different alterna- tive therapies. If freedom of informed choice in health care is made a right, as it should be, then costs will decline and quality will rise. More visits were made to alterna- tive physicians than to establishment (allopathic) family practitioners during 1992. These visits are not reim- bursed by insurance, private or government, yet they result in far less costs and hospitalization. 239 DEADLY DECEPTION I urge you to call a Conference on Alternatives to Allopathic Medicine for the purpose of establishing official government rec- Ognition. Representatives of all the varied disciplines of the natu- ral or holistic schools, as well as complementary physicians (M.D.'s and D.O.'s who combine establishment and alternative therapies) already having their own societies and organizations should be invited to send delegates. While representatives of the allopathic school of thought should invited, the meeting should be chaired by an individual acceptable to all groups, possibly a jurist. I believe that an agreement of all parties, though desirable, is not necessary. The biases are actually a virtue, because they indicate that the experts have gathered sufficient information to form an opinion with some bias. I doubt if a totally unbiased group could ever come to any effective decision, if decision is what is desired. A conference of strongly opposing biases would ensure the prepa- ration of minority reports on both sides as needed. Otherwise one would expect some form of one-sided whitewash as has indeed occurred in the past. In any case, the health and welfare of the people will benefit because the purveyors of health care will be wiser and more competitive in providing the best there is. Permitting informed freedom of choice in health care could result in annual savings in the order of 100 to 200 billion dollars. By eliminating unnecessary procedures, fraud and over- utilization, in addition to instituting competitive alternatives to the current allopathic system, makes the estimated savings realistic. This can be best accomplished when the government and insurance companies accept patients claims for alternative thera- pies on an equal basis with allopathic medicine. I do hope you will give an ear to the beat of a different drummer and take advantage of my sincerity, knowledge and experience. I am currently involved in writing and research, however, I am anxious to assist you in any way possible at my expense. I have enclosed my curriculum vitae for your consideration.

I wrote in my comments (in bold type and bracketed) and sent it back. 2B 2K OK OB OK OB OB OB OR OK OK OK OK OK KK 31st October 1993 HALLOWEEN! Dearest Daddy, Thank you so much for the fascinating translation of Dr. Willner's claims. There seems to be a lot of uncertainty over the past ten years of research within the holistic doctors and the ortho- dox - forever battling against each other. \"The Scam' is something I've been aware of for a year or so, and have spent many a time discussing it with Dr. Robert Jacobs (my herb Doctor). He, unfor- tunately, is not in London at the moment, so I have been unable to ask his thoughts on Dr. Willner's theories, but through our discus- sions, I know that he has very similar views, and I believe that Iam a prime example. However, he does, contrary to my Acupuncturist, believe that things like \"pentamodine\" (the anti-pneumonia inhala- tion I take each month) is beneficial. Where as my Acupuncturist disagrees and claims that the side effects will be far more difficult to handle that the pneumonia itself! My Acupuncturist \u2014 Dr. Ira Staebler \u2014 says he has heard of Dr. Willner, that he has been injecting himself quite a lot and that his theories are valid. He believes that Dr. Willner is right in saying HIV does not lead to AIDS, but that AIDS comes about to those with a certain life style. Malnutrition, drug users and the decadent lifestyle of countless anonymous lovers, 10 ejaculations per night, etc., etc... Basically those that abuse our bodies' defenses, purpose- fully or not, as in the case of 3rd World countries. 258 There are a few questions that, if you have a chance to slip into the conversation, would help clarify my head. If HIV does not necessarily lead to AIDS, then what does it do? (nothing!) AIDS taken for what it means - \"Acute [acquired] Immune Deficiency Syndrome\" - Surely if HIV infects the T4 cells [our fighter cells] then we will be bound to contract a disease soon enough? [It doesn't \"'attack\" and it causes nothing] How HIV? [Who cares? It's drugs and malnu- trition that causes AIDS] If, HIV does not lead to AIDS, then can the Immune system be boosted even with the HIV virus? [absolutely] If so, how? What foods? What supplements? Actually, I prob- ably know this. [You probably do \u2014 eat right, (organic foods) enjoy life and stop drugs.] What is Quilation? [Chelation - detoxifies, enhances circula- tion and improves the body's function including the immune response down to the individual cell] Are the T4 counts a true reading of one's immune strength? I have known that the virus HIV attack these cells. Therefore, the less you have, the less they have to attack \u2014 and when they've attacked them all \u2014 what then? [wrong again \u2014 get un-brain- washed \u2014 T4 counts are general in meaning; concentrate on getting healthier and stop taking tests!] Is it possible that I may not have HIV? That, because of a bout of mental disorder, malnutrition, Giardia and Intravenous Salmo- nella, my immune system had dropped so low that HIV seemed the only answer? I was originally also told I had AIDS; yet I stand now, fitter, stronger and healthier than ever \u2014 on a T4 count of 170 \u2014 ?! [You may not have HIV, but who cares? The test is notori- ously invalid and it doesn't make a difference in any case.] Is it worth having a test for Factor VIII as this seems to be the cause of AIDS? [NO! It's the impurities in Factor VIII that are the problem, and if you are not a hemophiliac, and not receiv- ing transfusions, forget it!] Should one be re-diagnosed? [WHAT FOR?] If HIV need not lead to AIDS, then what does it do? [NOTH- ING! Well, maybe a mild flu you didn't notice.] 259 DEADLY DECEPTION Does this discovery then bring about a decision between HIV and Factor VIII? [No!] Could this be connected to Ira's theory on lifestyle? [Now you're getting it!] I can't think of anymore questions and I've heard many differ- ent answers to the ones above, but would be interested to hear what he thinks. This is very exciting and also very complicated for my very un-scientific head!! [That's what fraud is all about. If doctors have been duped, don't feel too bad that you've been confused. Just get angry and shout it to the media!] But, I think what he is claiming, is very similar to what is being mumbled in the underground of HIV and AIDS medicines. The decision between HIV and factor VIII is I think a very important one, which \"the powers\" have chosen to ignore for fear of \"egg on their faces\"! [There is no such decision, and \"'the powers that be\" deserve prison] The whole thing is a very expensive scarry mess. [Don't forget deadly!] I believe the only way is find what you feel best with in the way of medicines and cures - and in my case, its a little bit here and a little from there, to try to find a balance - (Whatever you do, don't take AZT!) Its very exciting that Drs. such as Dr. Willner, are standing up and talking out loud. He HAS to be heard, not only for those contaminated but to lift the stigma that has been unjustly placed on those infected. [How right you are!] I tend to believe both Dr. Willner and Ira, that AIDS is brought about by a lifestyle and probably with factor VIII \u2014 but that leaves me unclear as to what and how HIV works? (But now you know: Nothing. It sleeps!) Exciting things are happening. I am not going to even think of contracting AIDS but concentrate on building up my body's immu- nity in a Holistic way, without as much as possible, using any of the drugs prescribed by \"the Scam\"'. Its cold, cold here in London and there always seems a million and one things to do. I have to write a huge, long essay now on my thoughts of the 20th Century American Art Exhibition which was fantastic, by the way. Yet even with that, there is a huge amount of back stabbing controversy. \"Who's to say that what was shown is American Art?\" Who are the manipulators? The world powers who want us 260 to believe only what they would like us to believe? The ones with the money? Help, its all so scarry!! Anyway, I wish you a happy day and send you lots and lots of love. I look forward to hearing about your conversation with Dr. Willner. Huge kiss, Nancy Thank you for the information once again. It came at a time when I was beginning to doubt my survival! All my sties, coldsores and toothache disappeared within two days of speaking to you \u2014 extraordinary how the mind plays. Just don't give in and believe the best. Hope is a fantastic cure!! NOW YOU'VE GOT IT \u2014 GOD BLESS! OE 6 2K 2K 2K 2 2 KK OK OK OK OK OR OR KK This young lady had been on drugs.

'*KAREN PARKER (International Educational Develop- ment) said that children in the United States suffered the most governmental disregard of any in the developed world. The United States had a relatively high percentage of children born to HIV-positive mothers. Studies showed that between two thirds to 87% of those infants would seroconvert to HIV- negative within 18 months without any therapeutic interven- tions. Unfortunately, many infants were treated with AZT, a drug whose extreme toxicity had been bringing it under scrutiny. According to many researchers, there was no rational reason to give HIV-positive babies that drug - the drug itself would surely kill them. The international community, and especially developing countries where AIDS was a crisis situation, needed to have all appropriate mechanisms such as adequate drug monitoring in order to ensure compliance with the most basic right - the right to life.''

Ariel Francais, Deputy Director, European Bureau, United Nations Development Programme. \"... promoters of this false hypothesis state that the 'proper monitoring of your T-cells' will assure that you will know at what stage to begin AZT treatment. The current primary measure for early intervention with AZT is when your T-cells (specifically CD4+ helper cells) 'fall to 500 or below on two 263 DEADLY DECEPTION consecutive blood tests.\" The CDC states (without benefit of scientific reference) that the 'normal' range for CD4+ helper cells in HIV-negative 'healthy' persons is 600 to 1200. However, based on PAI's research, given the published information in accredited medical journals! the normal range of CD4+ helper cells for healthy HIV-neg. adults is 237 to 1,817. Further, in tests completed on US Olympic athletes in 1984, the average range of CD4+ helper cells was between 400 and 600. Certainly, the US athletes were not considered to be unhealthy: yet these are the markers used to instill fear and manipulate HIV-positive persons into taking a toxic chemoth- erapy when they are otherwise healthy. Based on Dr. (Robert C.) Gallo's unproven hypothesis that HIV is the sole and direct cause of AIDS, the US Public Health \u2014 Service? has embarked on a campaign of implied terror and misinformation that has continued to state that \"HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.'' can be controlled by... early intervention... with Zivovudine... AZT (which) is cytotoxic, in that it kills all cells indiscriminately, not just those cells infected by HIV. Project AIDS International charges that this dogmatic hypothesis based on the findings of a person and the perpetration of this information by the United States Government who continues employing Dr. Gallo is either directly or indirectly responsible for the premature deaths of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. When PROJECT AIDS INTERNATIONAL (PAD) asked the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for scientific verification that HIV, was, in fact, the cause of AIDS, they were told \"it was just known\" that HIV causes AIDS. No scientific references were cited. Weeks later they received an information packet citing Dr. Gallo's paper from the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes 1:521-535/1988. Note that this article was published 4 years after Gallo announced his scam. Gallo's paper is the poorest excuse for a scientific document and certainly is not proof that HIV causes any disease. 26 He He ae oe 26 2s Hs Hs He He as 3s 2s 2s Hs He He 3s 3s He He He PAI in AN URGENT APPEAL FOR ACTION recognized \"*that the scientific and medical practices of the United States are accepted without question as an authority in most developing countries, with the same faith that U.S. citizens placed in Dr. Gallo. If we have been deceived? it has surely cost hundreds of thousands of lives and will ultimately result in the needless loss of millions of lives worldwide. In what 264 appears to be a conspiracy of profit over life, we wish to call attention to the propaganda of various AIDS educational publications; especially those documents published by the CDC in conjunction with the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associa- tion* (which is also endorsed by the US FDA) and includes the sharing of letterhead with the Pharmaceutical Advertising Council5. This appears to indicate an implication of impropriety based on the fact that the US FDA is an enforcement agency charged with the regulation of all legal drugs and, therefore, should maintain a professional distance from private pharma- ceutical interests so as to remain an impartial, unbiased Oversight agency. This has resulted in a monopoly of manipulation based on an unproven HIV hypothesis which is being marketed by both private and governmental sectors for the sake of financial gain at the expense of human life.''

In the United States'... two thirds of infants born to HIV-positive mothers also seroconverted to HIV-negative within eighteen months: again, without therapeu- tic intervention. From this, one could conclude that the practice of treating HIV-positive infants with AZT - based on 1) tests with questionable accuracy such as the ELISA and/or Western Blot and/or 2) presumptive diagnosis when no clinical illness is present - is murder! Murder as used here means 'the introduction of a known toxic substance that ultimately results in the infant's premature death.' The fact that prescribing AZT is considered a 'majority practice' is no defense for the violation for the basic human right to life.'' 6 Ok 9 2 2 2 6 9 2K OK GB OK KK OK KK HK A HK A KE PAI notes that although numerous studies substantiate Wellcome Ltd. claims that AZT ''prolongs life'' and ''enhances its quality'' these studies were made possible, directly or indirectly, by grants from the Burroughs-Wellcome Foundation. In their pamphlet ''Positive Benefits'', Wellcome states \"there are no life threatening side effects associated with zivovudine.'' PAI then lists all the ''side-effects'' asking if these prolong life or enhance its qualities - cancer, bone marrow depletion, anemia 265 DEADLY DECEPTION requiring blood transfusions, loss of mental acuity, etc. PAI ALSO POINTS OUT THAT THE ORIGINAL TOXICITY PROFILE ON AZT WAS FRAUDULENTLY REPORTED8, AND THAT IT IS ACTUALLY 1000 TIMES MORE TOXIC TO HUMAN CELLS THAN WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY CLAIMED'. PAI concludes with the following statement: \"'If action is not taken immediately against those who are directly or indirectly responsible for these crimes against humanity through the practice of profit over life, the drug- induced AIDS deaths will, most certainly, reach proportions unparalleled by any natural catastrophe in human history. Even none case of deprivation of this most basic human right - the right to life - should be the concern of all mankind. PAI PRESS STATEMENT: The patient is not dying of the unproven destruction of human cells by HIV, but by the proven effect of AZT. Therefore, we state that the use of AZT is both (a) cruel treatment and (b) fulfills the fact of clean torture. We state ''cruel treatment'' because the patient has been given a death sentence based on the unproven hypothesis of HIV=AIDS =DEATH and the patient cannot escape the physicians authority (also known as a \"'fear trap'') that the patient must take AZT. We state ''clean torture'' because the death caused by AZT will be said that it was the prognosed death caused by HIV infection. The result is a ''self-fulfilling prophecy.'' The cause of death will be called HIV infection rather than the treatment prescribed through the physicians. While the patient is dead, the physician is left clean. 1.
