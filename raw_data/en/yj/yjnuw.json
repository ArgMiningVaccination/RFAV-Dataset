As mRNA is a non -infectious, non-integrating platform, there is no potential risk of infection or insertional mutagenesis. Addition ally, mRNA is degraded by normal cellular processes. Efficient in vivo delivery can be achieved by formulating mRNA into carrier molecules, allowing rapid uptake and expression in the cytoplasm. mRNA is the minimal genetic vector; therefore, anti- vector im munity is avoided, and mRNA vaccines can be administered repeatedly. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) -formulated mRNA vaccine technology allows the delivery of precise genetic information together with an adjuvant effect to antigen -presenting cells. It is molecularly well defined, free of materials of animal origin, and synthesized by an efficient, cell- free in vitro transcription process from DNA templates. The technology associated with this vaccine is also capable of bypassing time -consuming standardization proc esses, thus speeding up its commercial production. Two mRNA vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization, the BNT162b2 vaccine by BioNTech and Pfizer, and the COVID -19 vaccine (mRNA -1273) by Moderna. Characteristics expressing the prefusi on-stabilized sp ike glycoprotein, and was developed by Moderna and the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of A llergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Vaccine composition and storage The vaccine contains a synthetic mRNA - single -stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA -encoding the pre-fusion stabilized spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS -CoV-2 virus. The vaccine also tate, and sucrose. The Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine is provided as a frozen suspension [stored between - 25\u00ba to - 15\u00baC ( -13\u00ba to 5\u00baF)] multi -dose vial containing 10 doses. The vaccine is a white to off -white, sterile, preservative -free frozen suspension for intr amuscular injection. The vaccine must be thawed prior to administration. After thawing, a maximum of 10 doses (0.5 mL each) can be withdrawn from each vial. Vials can be stored refrigerated between 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for up to 30 days prior to first u se. Unopened vials may be stored between 8\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (46\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) for up to 12 hours. After the first dose has been withdrawn, the vial should be held between 2\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) and discarded after 6 Moderna -19 Vacci ne, mRNA -1273 (100g) is administered intramuscularly as a series of two doses (0.5 mL each), given 28 days apart. DRAFT prepared by the SAGE Working Group on COVID -19 vaccines 19 January 2021 Background document for the Extraordinary meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) - 21 January 2021 4 Efficacy of the Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine Trial population The Phase 3 pivotal registration trial of the vaccine was conducted at sites in 99 centres across the United States and involved in total about 30,000 participants aged 18 years or older with no known history of SARS -CoV-2 infection but whose locations or circumstances put them at appreciable risk of acquiring COVID -19 (1). Participants were healthy or had stable pre -existing med ical conditions . In total, 25% (7512/30351) were aged 65 years or over (mean age: 70.6 years; range: 40- 95 years) and 16.7% ( 5065/30351) participants were under 65 years and at risk of severe Covid -19 illness (mean age: 49.0 years; range: 18 -79 years). The vaccine was administered in 2 doses separated by 28 days. The median age at vaccination was 51 years. Participants were randomised equally between vaccine and placebo groups. Women who were pregnant or breast -feeding were excluded. 2.2% of participants had serological or virological evidence of a past SARS -CoV-2 infection at entry to the trial. Most were white (79%) and similar numbers of males and females were included. The median body mass index was 28.1. The primary analysis of the trial results was con ducted when participants had been followed for a median of 64 days after the second vaccine dose and 61% had more than 56 days of follow -up. Efficacy against Covid -19 The primary endpoint was specified as efficacy against symptomatic Covid -19 at least 14 d ays after the second dose among participants who were seronegative at trial entry. There were 196 cases who met this definition, with 11 cases in the vaccinated group and 185 in the placebo group with the estimate of vaccine efficacy (VE) being 94.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 89.3% - 96.8%). Analyses were also conducted including all cases from the time of the first dose. There was evidence of protection both between the first (14 days after receipt of dose 1) and receipt of the second doses (VE=84.8%, 95% CI 66.1% - 94.2% - 7 cases in vaccine group, 46 cases in placebo group) and between the second dose and 14 days after the second dose (VE=100%, 95% CI 78.6% - 100% - 0 cases in vaccine group, 19 cases in placebo group). More detailed analyses indicate d that there was no evidence of efficacy until approx. 12 days after the first dose. In the period 14 or more days after the second vaccine dose, no significant variations in the estimates of vaccine efficacy were apparent when the primary analyses were stratified according to sex, age, race and ethnic group, or into those at high risk of severe Covid -9. In particular, among those aged 65 years or older there were 4 cases in the vaccinated group and 29 cases in the placebo group (VE 86.4%, 95% CI 61.4% - 95.2%). Efficacy against severe Covid -19 A total of 30 cases of severe Covid -19 occurred in trial participants 14 or more days after the second dose, all were in the placebo group (VE=100%, 95% CI 86.9% - 100%). Summary The vaccine was highl y efficacious against laboratory -confirmed Covid -19 from 14 days after the second vaccine dose until the end of the follow -up period, which was, on average, about 2 months DRAFT prepared by the SAGE Working Group on COVID -19 vaccines 19 January 2021 Background document for the Extraordinary meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) - 21 January 2021 5 after the second dose. Evidence of efficacy emerged from about 12 days after the first vaccine dose. No evidence of variations in efficacy were found in the various subgroups that were analysed and, importantly, in subgroups of participants likely to be at higher risk of severe Covid -19, including those over 65 years, the estimates of eff icacy were very high. Efficacy against severe Covid -19 was also very high, with all 30 cases occurring 14 or more days after the second dose being in the placebo group. Safety of the Moderna mRNA- 1273 COVID -19 vaccine In the Phase 3 trial, s afety data was collected from 30,351 participants 1 8 years of age , randomized 1:1 to vaccine or placebo, who received at least one dose of the vaccine (n=15,185) or placebo (n=15,166) . 87.9% of study participants had at least 28 days of follow -up after Dose 2, and t he median follow -up time for all participants was 9 weeks (>2 months) after Dose 2 (1). The safety data supported a favorable safety profile . Reactogenicity symptoms, defined as solicited local injection site or systemic reactions during the 7 days after vaccination, were frequent and mostly mild to moderate and short -lived after dosing for both adult age groups . Reactogenicity and adverse events (AEs) were generally milder and less frequent in participants in the older group (6 5 years of age) compared with the younger gro up (18 to <65 years of age) and tended to increase after the second dose. The vaccine's AE profile did not suggest any specific safety concerns. Severe adverse reactions occurred in 0.2% to 9.7% of participants, were more frequent after dose 2 than after dose 1, and were generally less frequent in older adults ( 65 years of age) as compared to younger adults. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and discontinuations due to AEs were low and comparable for both the vaccine and placebo grou ps. There were no specific safety concerns identified in subgroup analyses by age, sex, race, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, or prior SARS - CoV-2 infection at enrollment . Adverse Events Adverse events, that occurred within 28 days following each vaccin ation, were reported by 23.9% (n=3,632) of participants who received the v accine and 21.6% (n=3,277) of participants who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions in participants 18 years of age and older were pain at the injection site (92.0%), fatigue site (14.7%), and erythema at the injection site (10.0%). The median durations for pain were 2 -3 days . The highest rates of pain were in participants 18 to <64 years after dose 2, with 90.1% reporting any pain and 4.6% reporting Grade 3 pain. The median duration for fatigue in vaccine recipients was 2 days after any do se. The highest rates of fatigue were reported by participants 18 to 64 years after the second dose, with 67.6% reporting any fatigue, 10.6% reporting Grade 3, and 1 participant reporting Grade 4 (after Dose 1). Delayed localized injection site reaction w ith onset after 7 days was more frequent in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group and mostly seen after the first dose. DRAFT prepared by the SAGE Working Group on COVID -19 vaccines 19 January 2021 Background document for the Extraordinary meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) - 21 January 2021 6 Adverse Events of Special Interest (that would potentially require longer follow up) Lymphadenopathy related events Lymphadenopathy -related events were reported by 173 ( 1.1 %) of vaccine recipients and 95 (0.63 %) of placebo recipients. These events included lymphadenopathy (axillary swelling and tenderness of the vaccination arm) , lymphadenitis, lymph node pain, vaccin ation site lymphadenopathy, and axillary mass . These were plausibly related to vaccination. The median duration of lymphadenopathy following any dose was 1 to 2 days, and <1% reported Grade 3 axillary swelling/tenderness. L ymphadenopathy was more frequently observed in participants 18 to 64 years of age after dose 2, with 16.0% reporting any severity lymphadenopathy and 0.4% reporting Grade 3 lymphadenopathy. Bell's Palsy There were three reports of Bell's palsy in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group. In the vaccine recipients, the events occurred 22, 28, and 32 days after dose 2 vaccination . One event was a serious adverse event (reported as resolving), one case has resolved and one is ongoing. In the placebo recipients , the event occurred 17 days after dose 1. Causality assessment is confounded by predisposing factors in all the participants. The usual incidence of Bell`s palsy is 15 -30/100,000/year. The observed frequency of reported Bell's palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population and an association between COVID -19 and Bell's palsy has been reported. Currently available information on Bell's palsy is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. Surveillance for cases of Bell's palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations is a requirement and Bell`s palsy has been addressed in the risk management plan. Hypersensitivity -related events 233 events (1.5%) occurred in the vaccine arm and 166 events (1.1%) in the placebo arm. The hypersensitivity related events included injection site rash, injection site urticaria and maculo - papular rash. T here is a plausible relationship to vaccination of these events . No anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reactions with close temporal relation to the vaccine were reported during the trial. Serious Adverse Events The frequency of serious adverse events was low (1.0% in the vaccine arm and 1.0% in the placebo arm), without meaningful imbalances between study arms. As of December 3, 2020, there were 13 deaths in total with 6 in the vaccine and 7 in the placebo group. No causal relationship was determined. The SAE's thought to be related to the vaccine (as per the FDA ) include intractable nausea and vomiting in a 65 year old 1 day post the second dose . Two subjects , who were 46 and 51 years old , DRAFT prepared by the SAGE Working Group on COVID -19 vaccines 19 January 2021 Background document for the Extraordinary meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) - 21 January 2021 7 reported facial swelling one and two days post the second dose, respectively. Both subjects had prior dermal fillers. Special populations Pregnancies Women were screened for pregnancy prior to each vaccination and were excluded or discontinued from vaccination if there was a positive test. As of December 2, 2020, 13 pregnancies (6 in the vaccine and 7 in the placebo group) have been reported. The pregnancy outcomes in the placebo group include spontaneous abortion and an elective abortion. The other outcomes are not known to date and the pr egnant women are being followed. A combined developmental and perinatal/postnatal reproductive toxicity study of the vaccine in rats concluded that the vaccine at a dose of 100 g, given prior to mating and during gestation periods, did not have any adver se effects (including on female reproduction, fetal/embryonal development, or postnatal developmental). Summary The safety data supported a favorable safety profile. Reactogenicity was mostly mild to moderate, less frequent and severe in adults 65 years than in younger adults and generally more frequent after the second dose in age groups . There were no safety concerns identified in subgroup analyses by age, sex, race, ethnicity, comorbidities and health risks for severe COVID -19, and prior SARS -CoV- 2 infection Delayed localized injection site reaction with onset after 7 days was more frequent in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group and mostly seen after the first dose. Lymphadenopathy events were more frequent in the vaccine group compared w ith placebo and are plausibility related. Hypersensitivity -related events were more frequent in the vaccine group compared with placebo. No anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reactions with temporal relation to vaccination were reported during the tri al. Three cases of Bell's palsy were reported in vaccine recipients, and one in placebo recipients. Although there is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time, further surveillance for Bell's palsy is required as part of the risk References 1.

Population: Adults (18- 64 years) Intervention: Two doses of Outcome: COVID -19 (PCR -confirmed) Background: On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan City, Hubei Province , China. The cause was found to be a novel coronavirus, SARS- CoV -2. The disease caused by this novel virus has been named COVID -19. The outbreak of COVID -19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern in January 2020 . The disease has since spread, with an enormous impact on the health and well- being of individuals and populations worldwide. It has further caused major disruptions to various sectors of society and the economy across the globe. CRITERIA JUDGEMENTS RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROBLEM Is the problem a public health priority? No Un- certain Yes Varie s by settin g The cumulative number of COVID -19 cases globally has surpassed 88 828 387 with more than 1 926 635 deaths. Cases have been found in 190 different countries or territories throughout the world (status 11 January 2021 ). There has been collateral damage to other public health program mes. The COVID -19 situation is evolving rapidly; the most recent epidemiological situation can be found on the following website: https://covid19.who.int/table BENEFITS & HARMS OF THE OPTIONS Benefits of the intervention Are the desirable anticipated effects large?

No Un- certain Yes Varie s Considerable resources will be needed to ensure the implementation of a COVID -19 vaccination programme , especially given : (i) that COVID -19 vaccination is likely to be prioritized for populations (e.g. health care workers, older adults) without pre -existing robust immunization program mes in many settings, and (ii) the urgency of vaccination roll -out worldwide , which may necessita te additional surge resources to accelerate implementation with adequate infection prevention and control procedures in the context of COVID -19. Resources required include, but are not restricted to , human resources, vaccine costs, logistics, cold -chain ca pacity, planning and coordination, training, social mobilization and communications, and immunization safety surveillance . An estimated US$15.9 billion is needed for the vaccines pillar (COVAX) of the Access to COVID -19 Tools Accelerator (ACT -A) for 2020 - 21, in order to deliver 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. This does not include all delivery costs in all countries participating in COVAX, bilateral procurement deals, or research and development investments outside of COVAX (6). The World Bank has approved a financing window of up to US$12 billion to support low - and middle - income countries in purchasing and distributing vaccine (7) . Cost - effectiveness No Un- certain Yes Varie s Formal global cost -effectiveness analyses have not been conducted, but the emerging evidence indicates that the benefits, including the impact on recovery of the global economy , are likely to outweigh the cost of COVID -19 vaccination in general . Cost -effectiveness analyses should be conducted at country level; cost- effectiveness of COVID -19 vaccination may vary by country depending on COVID -19 burden, comparator interventions assessed, analysis perspective, and local cost- effectiveness thresholds used. The global economy is estimated to be losing US$375 billion per month due to the coronavirus pandemic. G20 countries have invested approximately US$10 trillion in domestic economic stimulus to mitigate the economic consequences of reduced business activity and unemployment due to the pandemic. Initial estimates suggest that COVID - 19 vaccination will provide substantial economic value in terms of averted morbidity and mortality costs and averted GDP losses (6;8 - 13). E Q UI Increa - sed Un- certain Reduced Varie s Equity and ethical considerations are critical. SAGE has produced a Values Framework (14) , Vaccine nationalism is seen as a threat to reducing health inequity, in [Type here] 19 What would be the impact on health inequities? which offers guidance on the fair allocation of COVID -19 vaccines based on six core ethical principles that should guide distribution. If distributed fairly , COVID -19 vaccines may have considerable impact on reducing health inequities. Storage and distribution of mRNA -1273 vaccines lies at -20\u00b0C. Once thawed, it can be kept in a refrigerator for up to 30 days. This r equirement is not shared by many other vaccine platforms. This cold chain capacity is not currently available in many low - and middle- income -countries, and in some regions of high -income countries, particularly in hard -to-reach or otherwise already disa dvantaged communities. If other vaccines with less demanding storage requirements are not made available, or if vaccines that are feasible and available to deliver are less efficacious or less safe, health inequities will result and existing health inequit ies may be exacerbated. particular as high -income countries have arranged bilateral contracts with manufacturers. This has led to the establishment of the Access to COVID -19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and within this, the COVAX facility, which aims to ensure equitable access to vac cines for its participating member states most of whom do not have bilateral contracts (15) . ACCEPTABILITY Which option is acceptable to key stakeholders (e.g. ministries of health, immunization managers)? Inter - venti on Com pari son Both Neit her Un- clear No scientific evidence is available. As vaccination is an eagerly awaited tool to combat the COVID -19 pandemic , it is assumed that key stakeholders, in particular ministries of h ealth and immunization managers , are strong ly in favo ur of it. The fact that 190 economies are participating in COVA X suggest s a very high acceptability of COVID -19 vaccination in gener al, though not necessarily of this vaccine in particular. Which option is acceptable to target group? Inter - venti on Com pari son Both Neit her Un- clear Vaccine acceptability varies between (sub -) population groups and may be correlated with the perceived risk posed by the disease. In a global survey (19 countries) o f acceptance rates in the general population of any COVID -19 vaccine WHO has worked with an external expert group to develop tools to understand public intentions to get a COVID -19 vaccine. The survey and interview guides are targeted [Type here] 20 product , 71.5% of participants reported that they would be very or somewhat likely to take a COVID -19 vaccine. Acceptance rates ranged from almost 55 % to 87% (16) . Acceptability of C OVID - 19 vaccination is currently being assessed by international polls (www.yougov.co.uk and www.ipsos.com ). towards populations prioritized for COVID -19 vaccines: adults and health workers. Gatherin g and using quality data on the behavioural and social drivers of vaccination will enable programmes to design, target and evaluate interventions to achieve greater impact with more efficiency, and to examine trends over time. The tools measure four domain s that influence vaccine uptake: what people think and feel about vaccines; social processes that drive or inhibit vaccination; individual motivations (or hesitancy) to seek vaccination; and practical factors involved in seeking and receiving vaccination. Assessing all domains will enable more comprehensive planning and evaluation. Publication is expected imminently. FEASIBILITY Is the intervention feasible to implement? No Pro ba bly No Un- cer tai n Pro ba bly Yes Yes Varie s Cold chain requirements and logistics may not be available in all settings , in particular in low - and middle -income -countries, and is expensive and time -consuming to establish. The combination of the product's logistic features and its reactogenicity makes mass workplace vaccination, which will be intended for this vaccine in many settings, more difficult. In particular, if many health workers are vaccinated at the same time, sev eral may be unable to work the next day because of mild post-vaccination immune responses. Balance of consequences Undesirable consequences clearly outweigh desirable consequences in most settings Undesirable consequences probably outweigh desirable consequences in most settings The balance between desirable and undesirable consequences is closely balanced or uncertain Desirable consequences probably outweigh undesirable consequences in most settings Desirable consequences clearly outweigh undesirable consequences in most settings [Type here] 21 Type of recommendation We recommend the intervention We suggest considering recommendation of the intervention We recommend the comparison We recommend against the intervention and the comparison Only in the context of rigorous research Only with targeted monitoring and evaluation Only in specific contexts or specific (sub)populations Recommendation (text) Vaccination with mRNA -1273 is recommended in persons aged 1 8 and above. The recommended schedule is two doses ( 100 \u00b5g, 0. 5 ml each) given intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle. An interval of 28 days between the doses is recommended. If the second d ose is inadvertently administered less than 2 8 days after the fir st, the dose does not need to be repeated. If administration of the second dose is inadvertently delayed it should be given as soon as possible thereafter, according to the manufacturer's instructions. It is currently recommended that individuals receive n o more than two doses in total. Implementation considerations Before implementation, countries should consider whether they have adequate logistic and cold -chain capacity in place to ensure vaccine distribution and administration under the mentioned requirements. In countries where various immunization stakeholders have a crucial role in vaccine distribution, information and open discussion will be required before the vaccine is deployed. Monitoring and evaluation WHO recommends the following post -authorization monitoring activities: vaccine effectiveness over time; ongoing collection of safety data in vaccine recipients; surveillance for COVID -19 among vaccinated individuals, looking for vaccine -induced enhanced disease (possibly as vaccine- induced antibody levels decline); safety data from inadvertently vaccinated pregnant women during trials and post -authorization; safet y data from pregnant women who receive vaccine because they are members of prioritized groups, e.g. health workers; prospective studies on the safety of mRNA -1273 in pregnant women; impact on infants of vaccination of breastfeeding mothers; safety data on vaccination in immunocompromised persons, including persons living with HIV and persons with autoimmune disease; [Type here] 22 impact of delayed second dose as currently implemented by certain countries. Research priorities WHO recommends the following research activities: immunogenicity and safety studies of co- administration with other vaccines, including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, to adults and older persons; studies to demonstrate whether this vaccine reduces SARS- CoV -2 transmission and viral shedding; clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of vaccination of children below the age of 1 8 years; stability of vaccine under alternative cold -chain distribution and storage conditions; effectiveness of the proposed strategies for the prevention and management of anaphylactic reactions; interchangeability and \"mix and match\" studies within and across COVID -19 vaccine platforms; global surveillance of virus evolution and the impact of virus mutants on vaccine effectiveness to support possible update of vaccines if needed; head -to-head studies with other vaccines on extent and duration of immunity using standardized neutralization assays and mucosal immunity assays. older adults Question: Should mRNA -1273 vaccine be administered to older adults to prevent COVID -19? Population: Older adults (65 years) Intervention: Two doses of m RNA -1273 Outcome: COVID -19 (PCR -confirmed) Background: On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan City, Hubei Province , China.

No Un- certain Yes Varie s Considerable resources will be needed to ensure the implementation of a COVID -19 vaccination programme , especially given : (i) that COVID -19 vaccination is likely to be prioritized for populations (e.g. health care workers, older adults) without pre -existin g robust immunization program mes in many settings, and (ii) the urgency of vaccination roll -out worldwide , which may necessitate additional surge resources to accelerate implementation with adequate infection prevention and control procedures in the contex t of COVID -19. Resources required include, but are not restricted to : human resources, vaccine costs, logistics, cold -chain capacity, planning and coordination, training, social mobilization and communications, and immunization safety surveillance . An esti mated US$15.9 billion is needed for the vaccines pillar (COVAX) of the Access to COVID -19 Tools Accelerator (ACT -A) for 2020 - 21, in order to deliver 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021. This does not include all delivery costs in all countries participating in COVAX, bilateral procurement deals, or research and development investments outside of COVAX (6). The World Bank has approved a financing window of up to US$12 billion to support low - and middle - income countries in purchasing and distributing vaccine (7). Cost - effectiveness No Un- certain Yes Varie s Formal global cost -effectiveness analyses have not been conducted, but the emerging evidence indicates that the benefits, including the impact on recovery of the global economy , are likely to outweigh the cost of COVID -19 vaccination in general . Cost -effectiveness analyses should be conducted at country level; cost -effectiveness of COVID -19 vaccination may vary by country depending on COVID -19 burden, comparator interventions assessed, analysis perspective, and local cost- effectiveness thresholds used. The global economy is estimated to be losing US$375 billion per month due to the coronavirus pandemic. G20 cou ntries have invested approximately US$10 trillion in domestic economic stimulus to mitigate the economic consequences of reduced business activity and unemployment due to the pandemic. Initial estimates suggest that COVID - 19 vaccination will provide substa ntial economic value in terms of averted morbidity and mortality costs and averted GDP losses (6;8 -13) [Type here] 36 EQUITY What would be the impact on health inequities? Increa - sed Un- certain Reduced Varie s Equity and ethical considerations are critical. SAGE has produced a Values Framework (14) , which offers guidance on the fair allocation of COVID -19 vaccines based on six core ethical principles that should guide distribution. If distributed fairly, COVID -19 vaccines may have considerable impact on reducing health inequities. Storage and distribution of mRNA -1273 vaccines lies at -20\u00b0C. This requirement is not shared by many other vaccine platforms. Once tha wed, it can be kept in a refrigerator for up to 30 days. This cold chain capacity is not currently available in many low - and middle- income -countries, and in some regions of high -income countries, particularly in hard -to-reach or otherwise already disadv antaged communities. If other vaccines with less demanding storage requirements are not made available, or if vaccines that are feasible and available to deliver are less efficacious or less safe, health inequities will result and existing health inequitie s may be exacerbated. Vaccine nationalism is seen as a threat to reducing health inequity, in particular as high- income countries have arranged bilateral contracts with manufacturers. This has led to the establishment of the Access to COVID -19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and, within this, the COVAX facility, which aims to ensure equitable access to vaccines for its participating member states most of whom do not have bilateral contracts (15) . ACCEPTABILIT Y Which option is acceptable to key stakeholders (e.g. ministries of Inter - venti on Com pari son Both Neit her Un- clear No scientific evidence is available. As v accination is an eagerly awaited tool to combat the COVID -19 pandemic , it is assumed that key stakeholders, in particular ministries of h ealth and immunization managers are strong ly in favo ur of COVID -19 vaccination. But they may need to convince other par tners or stakeholders to support COVID -19 immunization. The fact that 190 economies are participating in COVA X suggest s a very high acceptability of COVID -19 vaccination in general, though not necessarily of this vaccine in particular. [Type here] 37 health, immunization managers)? Which option is acceptable to target group? Inter - venti on Com pari son Both Neit her Un- clear Vaccine acceptability varies between (sub -) population groups, and may be correlated with the perceived risk posed by the disease. In a global survey (19 countries) on acceptance rates in the general population of any COVID -19 vaccine product, 71.5% of par ticipants reported that they would be very or somewhat likely to take a COVID -19 vaccine. Acceptance rates ranged from almost 55 % to 87% (16) . Acceptability of COVID - 19 vaccination is currently being assessed by international polls (www.yougov.co.uk and www.ipsos.com ). WHO has worked with an external expert group to develop tools to understand public intentions to get a COVID -19 vaccine. The survey and interview guides are targeted towards populations prioritized for COVID -19 vaccines: adults and health workers. Gathering and using quality data on the behavioural and social drivers of vaccination will enable programmes to design, target and evaluate interventions to achieve greater impact with more efficiency, and to examine trends over time. The tools measure four domains that influence vaccine uptake: what people think and feel about vaccines; social processes that drive or inhibit vaccination; individual motivations (or hesitancy) to seek vaccination; and practical factors involved in seeking and receiving vaccination. Assessing all domains will enable more comprehensive planning and evaluation. Publication is expected imminently. FEASIBILITY Is the intervention feasible to implement? No Pro ba bly No Un- cer tai n Pro ba bly Yes Yes Varie s Cold chain requirements and logistics may not be available in all settings , in particular in low - and middle -income -countries, and is expensive and time -consuming to establish.

Phase 2/3 clinical trials have demonstrated that the vaccine has similar safety and efficacy profiles in persons with various underlying medical conditions, including those that place them at increased risk for severe COVID -19. The comor bidities studied in phase 2/3 clinical trials include hypertension; diabetes; asthma; and pulmonary, liver and kidney disease; as well as chronic (stable and controlled) infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatit is B virus (HBV). Vaccination is recommended for persons with comorbidities that have been identified as increasing the risk of severe COVID -19. Immun ocompromised persons Immunocompromised persons are at higher risk of severe COVID -19. Available data are currently insufficient to assess vaccine efficacy or vaccine - associated risks in severely immunocompromised persons. It is possible that the immune response to the vaccine may be reduced , which may alter its effectiveness. In the interim, given that the v accine is not a live virus, immunocompromised persons who are part of a group recommended [Type here] 39 for vaccination may be vaccinated. Information and, where possible, counselling about vaccine safety and efficacy profiles in immunocompromised persons should be prov ided to inform individual benefit -risk assessment. Pregnant women Pregnant women are at higher risk of severe COVID -19 compared to women of child- bearing age who are not pregnant, and COVID19 has been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. T he available data on m RNA -1273 vaccination of pregnant women are insufficient to assess vaccine efficacy or vaccine -associated risks in pregnancy. However, it should be noted that the m RNA -1273 vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell and is degraded quickly. Developmental and reproductive toxicology (DART) studies in animals have not shown harmful effects in pregnancy. Further studies are planned in pregnant women in the coming months. As data from thes e studies become available, recommendati ons on vaccination will be updated accordingly. In the interim, WHO recommends not to use m RNA -1273 in pregnancy, unless the benefit of vaccinating a pregnant woman outweighs the potential vaccine risks, such as in health workers at high r isk of exposure and pregnant women with comorbidities placing them in a high- risk group for severe COVID -19. Information and, if possible, counselling on the lack of safety and efficacy data for pregnant women should be provided. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. Lactating women Breastfeeding offers substantial health benefits to lactating women and their breastfed children. Vaccine efficacy is expecte d to be similar in lactating women as in other adults. However, there are no data on the saf ety of COVID -19 vaccines in lactating women or on the effects of mRNA vaccines on breastfed children. As the m RNA -1273 vaccine is not a live virus vaccine and the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell and is degraded quickly, it is biologically and c linically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. On the basis of these considerations, a lactating woman who is part of a group recommended for vaccination, e.g. health workers, should be offered vaccination on an equivalent basis. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding after vaccination. Persons living with HIV Persons living with HIV may be at higher risk of severe COVID -19. Among the phase 2/3 clinical trial participants with well controlled HIV, there were no reported differences in safety signals. HIV -positive persons who are well controlled on highly active antiretroviral therapy and are part of a group recommended for vaccination can be vaccinated. Available data on administration of the vaccine are currently insuffi cient to allow assessment of vaccine efficacy or safety for persons living with HIV who are not well controlled on therapy. It is possible t hat the immune response to the vaccine may be reduced, which may alter its effectiveness. In the interim, given that the vaccine is not a live virus, persons living with HIV who are part of a group recommended for vaccination may be vaccinated. Information and, where possible, counselling about vac cine safety and efficacy profiles in immunocompromised persons should be provided to inform individual benefit -risk assessment. It is not necessary to test for HIV infection prior to vaccine administration. Persons with autoimmune conditions No data are currently available on the safety and efficacy of m RNA -1273 in persons with autoimmune conditions, although these persons were eligible for enrolment in the clinical trials. Persons with autoimmune conditions who have no contraindications to va ccination may be vaccinated. [Type here] 40 Implementation considerations Before implementation, countries should consider whether they have adequate logistic and cold -chain capacity in place to ensure vaccine distribution and administration under the mentioned require ments. In the countries where various immunization stakeholders have a crucial role in the vaccine distribution, information and open discussion will be required before the vaccine is deployed. Monitoring and evaluation WHO recommends the following post -authorization monitoring activities: vaccine effectiveness over time; ongoing collection of safety data in vaccine recipients; surveillance for COVID -19 among vaccinated individuals, looking for vaccine -induced enhanced disease (possibly as vaccine - induced antibody levels decline); safety data from inadvertently vaccinated pregnant women during trials and post -authorization; safety data from pregnant women who receive vaccine because they are members of prioritized groups, e.g. health workers; prospective studies on the safety of mRNA -1273 in pregnant women; impact on infants of vaccination of breastfeeding mothers; safety data on vaccination in immunocompromised persons, including persons living with HIV and persons with autoimmune disease; impact of delayed second dose as currently implemented by certain countries . Research priorities WHO recommends the following research activities: immunogenicity and safety studies of co- administration with other vaccines, including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, to adults and older persons; studies to demonstrate whether this vaccine reduces SARS -CoV -2 transmission and viral shedding; clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of vaccination of children below the age of 18 year s; stability of vaccine under alternative cold -chain distribution and storage conditions; effectiveness of the proposed strategies for the prevention and management of anaphylactic reactions; interchangeability and \"mix and match\" studies within and across COVID -19 vaccine platforms; global surveillance of virus evolution and the impact of virus mutants on vaccine effectiveness to support possible update of vaccines if needed; head -to-head studies with other vaccines on extent and duration of immunity using standardized neutralization assays and mucosal immunity assays.
