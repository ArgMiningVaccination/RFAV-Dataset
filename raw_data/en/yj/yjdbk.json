Results of the trial, published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine , were significantly better than those seen with other therapies available to heavily relapsed and treatment-resistant myeloma patients who had already received the three main classes of treatment. Nearly three-quarters of the patients had at least a partial response to the therapy. About a third achieved a complete remission. Median time without the disease worsening was 8.8 months with this new treatment, but Dr. Larry Anderson, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and co-first author of the article, pointed out that patients who received the trial's maximum dose of engineered T-cells experienced longer remissions, bringing the average to more than 12 months. Previously, similar patients treated with currently available therapies following multiple relapses had an average of three to four months of remission. \"We have patients that are over two years out from their single infusion of CAR T -cells and still in remission despite having no other treatment options when they were enrolled in this trial,\" said Dr. Anderson, a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center who cares exclusively for patients with plasma cell disorders, mostly myeloma patients. \"The results mark a true break - through with unprecedented depth and du ration of remissions from what we hope will be the first cellular therapy New CAR T-cell therapy extends remission in heavily relapsed multiple myeloma patients Please see THERAPY on page 4 Dr. Larry AndersonFrom Staff Reports Vaccinating health care workers resulted in an immediate and notable reduction of positive COVID-19 cases among employees, reducing the number of required isolations and quarantines by more than 90 percent, according to UT S outhwestern data published in the New England Journal of Medicine . Health care workers were among the first groups to be eligible for vaccination. \"In light of this real-world experience clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of immunization, further understanding of the reticence of some individuals to take advantage of vaccination bears even greater importance,\" said first author Dr. William Daniel, Vice President and Chief Quality Officer. During the first 31 days of vacci - nations becoming available, UTSW pr ovided a first dose to 59 percent of roughly 23,000 employees, while 30 percent were able to be fully vaccinated in that time frame. Among the findings: 1.5 percent became infected. Infection rates were highest - 2.6 percent - among nonvaccinated employees. Infection rates were lowest - 0.05percent - among those fully vaccinated.

By Carol Marie Cropper A childhood health scare set in motion Dr. Natasha Houshmand's career path to becoming a physician. At age 7, with intense abdominal pain, she was taken to an emergency room. A doctor quickly put her and her frightened parents at ease with a diagnosis of appendi - citis and a plan to correct it - surgery. Th at experience of compassionate, effective patient care left an indelible mark that inspired her to enter medical school and then become a surgeon herself. Dr. Houshmand's dedication and skill in patient care have led to her selection as winner of the Ho Din Award, UT Sou thwestern Medical School's most prestigious honor, given each year by Southwestern Medical Foundation to recognize a doctor with attri - butes inherent in great physicians. It was established in 1 943 and comes with a medal, certificate, and $10,000 scholarship. \"Natasha is a born leader who inspires others with her commitment to excellence and absolute dedica - tion to serve,\" said Dr. Angela Mihalic, Dean of Med ical Students, Associate Dean of Student Affairs, and Professor of Pediatrics. \"I have no doubt that she will remain a role model throughout her career, will positively impact countless patients, and will make UT S outhwestern very proud to have played a role in her education.\" In the years following her recovery from appendi - citis, Dr. Houshmand's interest in medicine grew. As a 15 -year-old high school senior (she skipped grades 6 and 7 in school), she persuaded a Dallas surgeon - the father of a schoolmate at her private school -to let her tag along one Saturday while he visitedpatients during rounds.

Many will participate in the May event along with the 23 graduates from this year's smaller COVID-19 year class. In 2020, for the first time in its history, the Medical School held a virtual commencement for its graduates rather than gathering in person during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Graduate School post - poned its commencement entirely. Th e rollout of several COVID-19 vaccines and a drop in hospitaliza - tions for the virus in North Texas al lowed for the return to in-person commencements, said Dr. W. P. Andrew Lee, Executive Vice Presi - dent for Academic Affairs, Provost, an d Dean of the Medical School. \"This year's graduating Medical School Class has endured a great many chal - lenges due to the pandemic, including being pulled of f clerkships, having a completely virtual residency interview season, and having to celebrate Match Day virtually,\" said Dr. Angela Mihalic, Dean of Medical Students, Associate Dean of Student Affairs, and Professor of Pediatrics. \"We are delighted that we will be able to honor this momentous occasion on the campus and in the presence of their loved ones who have sacrificed so much to support them in accom - plishing their dream of becoming a physician.\" Th is year's group of Medical School gradu -Reunited and triumphant Medical School, Graduate School to celebrate with in-person commencement exercises after a year of pandemic challengesCOMMENCEMENT CELEBRATION Please see COMMENCEMENT on page 4By Carol Marie Cropper UT Southwestern's Medical School and Graduate Sc hool of Biomedical Sciences will bring graduating students and their families to campus this month for commencement ceremonies celebrating the joy and pride of graduation - made even more poignant due to the past year's COVID-19 challenges. Th e outdoor ceremony for 210 graduates of the Medical School is scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday, May 8, on Eugene McDermott Plaza and will move into the Tom and Lula Gooch Auditorium if needed due to weather. The Graduate School commencement is scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday, May 20, also on McDermott Plaza. Graduates at both commence - ments will be limited to two guests, and vi sitors attending will be required to wear masks and remain socially distanced from other guests. Both events will be livestreamed and recorded for later viewing. \"We are elated to be able to have our 2021 commencement in person, thanks to the hard work and the diligence of countless members of the UT Sou thwestern community to ensure that our campus is a safe environment,\" said Dr. Andrew Zinn, Dean of the Graduate School and an alumnus of both UTSW's Graduate and Medical Schools. \"It is heartwarming to be able to also invite our 2019-2020 graduates, whose commencement was postponed, to participate in this ceremony.\"Page 2 May 2021 Center Times is published by the Office of Communications, Marketing, and Public Affairs at UT Southwestern Med ical Center . UT Southwestern is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity Employer. Women, minorities, veterans, and individuals with disabilities are encouraged to apply.President: Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky Executive Vice President for Institutional Advancement: Dr. Marc NivetInterim Assistant Vice President, Communications and Public Affairs: Diane had previously identi - fied the structures of some members of t he Cys-loop superfamily in a signifi - cant step toward creating drugs that f it onto these ion channels to block or enhance their function. However, said study leaders Dr. Colleen M. Noviello, a Senior Research Scien - tist, and Dr. Ryan Hibbs, Asso - ciate Professor of Neuroscience and B iophysics, the shape, or conforma - tion, of these channels is not fixed. C ys-loop receptors cycle through three major states during their gating cycle that correspond to when they're closed and waiting to respond to a ligand, or activating molecule (resting state); when they've responded to the ligand and opened for ion flow (open state); or when they are still holding the ligand but have closed again (desensitized state). After trying for years to characterize the structure of the nicotinic acetylcho - line receptor 7 , success finally came UT Southwestern's acquisi - tion of cryogenic electron microscopy e quipment that allows scientists to take photos at atomic level resolution. With these new tools, the researchers imaged 7 in its different conforma - tions. Because 7 's structure is dynamic, allowing it to shift and wiggle, the researchers added different ligands to stabilize it so the cryo-EM images wouldn't be blurry from motion. The team said that these newly identified structures for 7 could eventually be used as a template for pharmaceutical companies to develop new medicines that target this and related nicotinic acetylcho - line receptors. They plan to continue s tudying 7 in various cell types and how it interacts with other molecules and proteins. \"The more we know about this important receptor found on so many diverse cell types, the closer we'll get to understanding how it functions in physiology and disease,\" said Dr. Hibbs, a member of the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute. Dr. Hibbs is an Effie Marie Cain Scholar in Medical Research. UTSW scientists have characterized three different conformations of 7, a key cell-surface protein. Credit: Leah Baxter Dr. Ryan HibbsStudy reveals structure of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Identification of three shapes of a cell-surface protein could pave the way for new disease treatments More online : Read the full story in the newsroom at UTSouthwestern. edu/newsroom.By Christen Brownlee UT Southwestern researchers h ave identified the structure of a key member of a family of proteins called nicotinic acetylcholine recep - tors in three different shapes it takes w hile performing its job. The work, published in Cell, could eventually lead to new pharmaceutical treatments for a large range of diseases or infections, including schizophrenia, lung cancer, and even COVID-19. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are members of a broader superfamily of proteins called Cys-loop recep - tors that function as ion channels o n cell surfaces and are found in the membranes of many cell types. When the right molecule settles on these receptors, it acts as a key and opens the gated channels, letting ions flood from the outside to the inside of cells to trigger other cellular processes. Nico - tinic acetylcholine receptors respond t o acetylcholine, a molecule that nerve cells use to communicate with each other. However, they also respond to other molecules found outside the body, such as nicotine, the essential nutrient choline, and a toxin found on the skin of poison dart frogs called epibatidine. These receptors, which have been identified in nerve, lung, and immune cells, are connected to conditions such as mental illness, neurodegen - erative diseases, lung cancers, and e ven the destructive immune reac - tions characteristic of COVID-19 and other infections.By Christen Brownlee Researchers at UT Southwestern a nd Indiana University have repro - grammed scar-forming cells in mouse s pinal cords to create new nerve cells, spurring recovery after spinal cord injury. The findings, published in Cell Stem Cell , could offer hope for the hundreds of thousands of people worldwide who suffer a spinal cord injury each year. Cells in some body tissues prolif - erate after injury, replacing dead or d amaged cells as part of healing. However, explained study leader Dr. Chun-Li Zhang, Professor of Molecular Biology, the spinal cord typically does not generate new neurons after injury - a key roadblock to recovery. Because the spinal cord acts as a signal relay between the brain and the rest of the body, its inability to self-repair perma - nently halts communication between t hese two areas, leading to paralysis, loss of sensation, and sometimes life-threat - ening consequences such as an inability t o control breathing or heart rate. Dr. Zhang said the brain has some limited capacity to produce new nerve cells, relying on progenitor cells to turn on distinct regenerative path - ways. Using this knowledge as inspira - tion, he and his colleagues looked for c ells that might have similar potential for regeneration in the spinal cord. Working with a mouse model of spinal cord injury, the researchers investigated a marker normally found in immature neurons. The scientists found this marker present in the spinal cord after injury and tracked down the cells that produce it: non-neuronal NG2 glia cells. NG2 glia serve as progenitors for cells called oligodendrocytes, which produce the insulating fat layer that surrounds neurons. They are also known to form glial scars following injury. Dr. Zhang's team showed that when the spinal cord was injured, these glia temporarily adopted molec - ular and morphological markers of i mmature neurons.To determine what caused NG2 glia to change, the researchers focused on SOX2, a stem cell protein induced by injury. They genetically manipu - lated these cells to inactivate the g ene that makes this protein. In mice with the altered cells, researchers saw fewer immature neurons in the days following injury, suggesting that SOX2 plays a key role in helping NG2 glia make these cells. Dr. Zhang and his colleagues then genetically manipulated NG2 glia to overproduce SOX2. In the weeks after spinal cord injury, mice with this manipulation produced tens of thou - sands of new mature neurons. Further i nvestigation showed that these neurons integrated into the injured area, making the new connections with existing neurons that are necessary to relay signals between the brain and body. Even more promising, said Dr. Zhang, is that this genetic engineering led to functional improvements after spinal cord injury. Animals engi - neered to overproduce SOX2 in their N G2 glia performed markedly better on motor skills weeks after spinal cord injury compared with those that made normal SOX2 amounts. Not only did these animals have new neurons that appeared to take over for those damaged during injury, Dr. Zhang explained, but they also had far less scar tissue at the injury site that could hinder recovery. Eventually, Dr. Zhang said, researchers may be able to discover safe and effective ways to overproduce SOX2 in human spinal cord injury patients, helping repair their injuries with new neurons while reducing scar tissue formation. \"The field of spinal cord injury has extensively researched trying to heal the damage with stem cells that produce new neurons, but what we're proposing here is that we may not need to transplant cells from the outside,\" said Dr. Zhang, an alumnus of the UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. \"By encouraging NG2 glia to make more SOX2, the body can make its own new neurons, rebuilding from within.\" Dr. Zhang is a W.W.

Ethan Halm was drawn to internal medicine by the intellectual challenge of diagnosing and treating a broad range of conditions. He ulti - mately chose to become a general i nternist because the specialty focuses on \"all of you,\" he said. \"There is a lot of satisfaction in being able to manage a large number of clinical conditions, develop long-term relationships with patients, and help them live healthier lives by managing their existing medical conditions, as well as counseling them on ways to prevent future prob - lems,\" said Dr. Halm, Chief of the W illiam T. and Gay F. Solomon Divi - sion of General Internal Medicine a nd Professor of Internal Medicine and Population and Data Sciences. In recognition of his efforts, Dr. Halm has been appointed the inau - gural holder of the Raminder Kumar, M .D. Distinguished Professorship in General Internal Medicine. The endowment was recently established by the family of Dr. Kumar in celebra - tion of her birthday and as a tribute t o honor her previous service as a UT Southwestern faculty member for almost 20 years. \"I am very honored and humbled,\" Dr. Halm said. \"Dr. Kumar made long-standing contributions to UT Southwestern as the founding Chief of General Internal Medicine at the Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where she recruited 11 faculty members, including several who are now academic leaders at UTSW and beyond.\" D r. Vinay Kumar, also a former UTSW faculty member and now a Pathology Professor at the Univer - sity of Chicago's Biologic Sciences D ivision and Pritzker Medical School as well as Dr. Raminder Kumar's husband, said his family established deep academic and personal relation - ships with UT Southwestern.\" Our affections and respect for UTSW did not abate after we left Dallas. So, when it came time for our family to give something back, we decided to establish this distinguished professorship,\" Dr. Vinay Kumar said. \"We are delighted that Dr. Halm will be the inaugural holder. Although my wife was trained as a hematologist, she chose to work as a general inter - nist for the very same reasons that Dr H alm did. So it is a wonderful match.\" The endowment will help support new research and educational activi - ties in General Internal Medicine at U TSW and the VA Medical Center, he added. A general internist, Dr. Halm provides preventive care and manages adult patients with multiple chronic conditions. His research focuses on improving cancer screening and early detection among underserved patients in Dallas County. His team also specializes in using electronic health record data to predict and reduce the risk of hospital read - missions as well as undiagnosed d iabetes or prediabetes, among other adverse events. \"All of these efforts have a strong focus on reducing the large disparities in health that have most recently been laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic,\" he said. Dr. Halm received his medical degree from Yale School of Medicine, an M.P.H. from Harvard University, and an MBA from the University of Tennessee. Following residency at the University of California, San Francisco, he completed a general internal medicine and health services research fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was recruited to UTSW as General Internal Medicine Division Chief in 2008. Dr. Halm said he is especially gratified that some of his team's most effective interventions to reduce hospital readmissions and improve colon cancer screening that started as research grants have been sustained as part of health system practice. \"So much health care, including how we screen for and manage cancer and chronic diseases, has been severely disrupted by COVID-19,\" he said, \"so future work will need to figure out better ways to deliver care using a variety of virtual modalities like telehealth, mailings, and online health education.\" Dr. Halm also holds the Walter Family Distinguished Chair in Internal Medicine in Honor of Albert D. Roberts, M.D. Williamson named to ASAHP Board Dr. Jon Williamson, Dean of the UT Southwestern School of Health Professions, was recently elected to the Board of Directors for the Association of Schools Advancing Health Profes - sions (ASAHP), the national organiza - tion for schools of allied health. A SAHP's primary mission is to advance health through profes - sional collaboration. It also focuses o n improving the quality and quantity of the health professions workforce. Serving three-year terms, board members are tasked with overseeing the activities and affairs of the association. \"It is an honor to be recognized in this way by peers from across the nation,\" said Dr. Williamson. \"The ASAHP is well-positioned as a national organization to help address the needs of all allied health professions.\" As an ASAHP member for more than a decade, Dr. Williamson has served the organization by helping to facilitate increased research activity in the health professions. He is on the editorial board for the association's Journal of Allied Health and was elected as an ASAHP Fellow in 2018. Dr. Williamson holds the Arnold N. and Carol S. Ablon Professorship in Biomedical Science. Dr. Ethan Halm Dr. Jon WilliamsonNEWS MAKERSBy Carol Marie Cropper While UT Southwestern's health care teams a nd staff bravely faced challenges from a pandemic this past year, they also came up with innovative ways to improve patient care. Health system faculty and employees submitted more than 100 proposals for this year's Health System Celebration of Excellence poster competition - everything from a way to cut medication costs to a strategy to reduce the number of babies transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for low blood sugar. These were among the eight projects honored at the March 26 event, held virtually this year due to COVID-19. A finalist and a winner were chosen in each of four categories - quality, service, people, and financial stewardship - from posters that described an idea for improvement. In other awards, four employees were recognized for efforts to improve patient safety. \"We have a lot to celebrate,\" Dr. William Daniel, Vice President and Chief Quality Officer, told the more than 1,150 people listening in during the third annual Celebration of Excel - lence, noting the UTSW staff's accomplishments d uring these trying times. \"In fact, our ability to achieve these kinds of results in the midst of a pandemic - no matter how exhausting - may be our finest hour,\" added Dr. Daniel, a UTSW Medical School alumnus. Achieving clinical excellence is not about buildings and facilities, added Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky, UT Southwestern President - \"It is asking every day, 'In what way can we make our care better, safer, more patient-centered?'\" The theme for this year's event was team - work, with an address from keynote speaker Dr. E duardo Salas, Chair of Rice University's Depart - ment of Psychological Sciences. D r. Salas spent 15 years as a research psychol - ogist and headed training technology develop - ment at the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command ( NAVAIR-Orlando) in Florida before joining academia. He co-authored the book, Teams That Work: The Seven Drivers of Team Effectiveness , and received the 2016 Lifetime Achievement Award for Contributions to Psychology from the American Psychological Association. \"We now know that teamwork in health care really does matter - that teamwork leads to saving lives, improvements in patient safety, and improvements in quality of care,\" Dr. Salas told the audience. An analysis of research showed health care systems that use team training reduced medical errors 18 percent and improved patient mortality rates 6 percent, he said. To have good teamwork, an organization needs capable employees who have a shared understanding and a willingness to cooperate and coordinate, Dr. Salas said. Communication and good coaching from leaders are also impor - tant, he said, but the critical element is having t he tools in place to support the effort, he added. Academia is \"terrible\" when it comes to recruiting the type of employees who are more interested in working as part of a team than going their own way as lone wolves, Dr. Salas said. And health care systems have a history of keeping toxic employees if they happen to bring in a lot of revenue, he added. \"Don't hire and don't tolerate toxic people,\" Dr. Salas advised. Health care systems are now more willing to remove revenue generators who are toxic, he said.During a panel discussion following Dr. Salas' talk, Dr. John Warner, Executive Vice President for Health System Affairs, said some employees might feel they have less freedom to speak up than others. One way to deal with this, Dr. Salas said, would be to have the doctor in charge kick off rounds by telling subordinates, \"I like to be chal - lenged.\" Or a department could put up posters t hat say, \"I'm not perfect,\" he suggested. Dr. Salas complimented UT Southwestern for addressing the issue, saying it is one of the few institutions with the courage to do so. Employees here have shared goals - a key to success, he said. \"You as a culture, as an organi - zation, care about what you do,\" Dr. Salas said. D r. Warner said UT Southwestern's commit - ment to teamwork is what brought him here, and i t is \"teamwork that has kept me here.\" He listed some of the institution's recent accomplishments: more than 2,000 COVID-19 outpatients were treated through March 15, in addition to almost as many inpatients. By the end of March, employees had administered more than 225,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses. Meanwhile, UT S outhwestern ranked eighth among the nation's academic medical centers in the Vizient Quality and Accountability Rank - ings for patient mortality rates in 2020 and in t he top 97th percentile for patient satisfaction by Press Ganey Associates, a company that performs patient surveys. UT Southwestern completed the third tower of William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital on time in the middle of a pandemic and is now constructing new facilities across the street to add needed space for cancer patient care and brain research, he said. Future plans call for extending UT Southwestern's reach by building facilities at seven to nine locations throughout North Texas. \"We want to be the preferred broad-scale specialty provider in North Texas,\" Dr. Warner said. A video featuring the parents of quadru - plets born at UTSW last summer provided an e xample of how effective teamwork can posi - tively impact patients. F aced with a couple expecting four babies, doctors came up with a plan, said Dr. Becky Ennis, Associate Professor of Pediatrics and a UTSW Medical School alumna. When the big day arrived, there were three health care providers ready to focus on each new life, she said. \"I have beautiful, healthy baby boys, and I don't know if that would have been possible if it weren't for UT S outhwestern,\" their mom, Katie Sturm, said in the video. Dr. Daniel holds the William T. Solomon Professorship in Clinical Quality Improvement at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Dr. Podolsky holds the Philip O'Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Presiden - tial Chair in Academic Administration, and the D oris and Bryan Wildenthal Distinguished Chair in Medical Science.

Page 4 May 2021 ally, we realized that just having student diver - sity is not enough; we needed an additional Dean to e nhance our efforts to foster an inclusive envi - ronment for basic science trainees and faculty at UT S outhwestern.\" Dr. D\u00edaz V\u00e1zquez, who came to UT S outh- western from the University of Pennsylvania wh ere he held a comparable role, said community outreach and mentoring are key to recruiting more students and postdoctoral fellows from underrepresented populations. While UTSW has seen significant growth in URM graduate students over the past two decades, leaders strive to do better. \"If we invest in our community and in mentoring, I think we can make a huge differ - ence,\" Dr. D\u00edaz V\u00e1zquez said. \"The talent is th ere, but it's about creating opportunities and awareness as well as providing resources to help students and trainees pursue the careers they want.\" Dr. D\u00edaz V\u00e1zquez said he intends to lean on his many relationships with historically Black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions to attract recruits. Other long-term recruitment strategies might include developing outreach initiatives for students in grades K-12 and providing graduate students and fellows a platform to share their educational experiences with the community. A native of Puerto Rico, Dr. D\u00edaz V\u00e1zquez earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry at Texas A&M University and completed his postdoctoral training at the University of Pennsylvania. Initially interested in becoming a physician, he discovered research as a college junior. Following postdoctoral training, he shifted his focus to mentoring because that was often a missing piece in his own development. \"The way we think about mentoring and outreach has to adjust moving forward. While we will eventually attend conferences in person again, we also need to utilize virtual visits for those who might not have the means to go to a conference and to reach out to schools we have not engaged with before,\" he said. Creating diverse learning environments to help students and trainees find the professional paths that suit them is the overall goal, Dr. D\u00edaz V\u00e1zquez said. \"There is more that we can do to promote a diverse and inclusive environment for basic science research at UT S outhwestern,\" Dr. Zinn said. \"Advocacy by graduate students and post - doctoral fellows in the wake of the racial injus - tices that came to the fore during the pandemic pr ompted us to redouble our efforts. Adding a new Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion was one of the key recommendations by graduate students and postdocs.\" The appointment of Dr. D\u00edaz V\u00e1zquez reflects UT S outhwestern's commitment to d iversity and inclusion. Late last year, Dr. Quinn Capers IV, a nationally recognized leader on diversity and inclusion in academic medicine, joined UT S outhwestern as Associate Dean for Faculty Diversity. Dr. Capers holds the Rody P. Cox, M.D. Professorship in Internal Medicine. Dr. Zinn holds the Rolf Haberecht and Ute Schwarz Haberecht Deanship of the UT S outh- western Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.New Assistant Dean to lead diversity, inclusion efforts in Graduate School Dr. Arnaldo D\u00edaz V\u00e1zquez More online : Read the full story on Center Times Plus at utsouthwestern.edu/ctplus .By Nyshicka Jordan Dr. Arnaldo D\u00edaz V\u00e1zquez joined UT South - western earlier this year as the inaugural Assis - tant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion in the Gr aduate School of Biomedical Sciences, part of broader efforts to expand racial and ethnic diver - sity among students, trainees, and faculty across th e institution's three schools. In this role, Dr. D\u00edaz V\u00e1zquez is tasked with strengthening the school's focus on recruit - ment, retention, and mentorship, partnering wi th Associate Dean Dr. Nancy Street, a UTSW Graduate School alumna who has spearheaded existing diversity and inclusion efforts. Dr. D\u00edaz V\u00e1zquez joined the executive leadership of the Graduate School's diversity initiatives, including the Provost's Initiative for Diverse Emerging Scholars Program (PROVIDES), launched last year to mentor postdoctoral fellows from under - represented minority (URM) groups and support th eir advancement to faculty positions. Dr. D\u00edaz V\u00e1zquez also is working to fill a gap in the Grad - uate School's diversity pipeline programs - the lac k of a postbaccalaureate fellowship program that would enable students who missed out on research experience in college to gain such expe - rience in preparation for graduate school. \"W hile the Graduate School student popula - tion is very diverse overall, we recognized that ce rtain populations continue to be underrepre - sented, and we wanted an Assistant Dean to be ab le to extend our current recruitment efforts to these populations,\" said Dr. Andrew Zinn, Dean and alumnus of the Graduate School. \"Addition - option to become available for myeloma patients. Even though we d on't yet know if some of these patients may be cured, and many relapse within one to two years, it can at least buy many patients time until other treatment options become available. Most patients also have good quality of life with relatively low risk of severe CAR T -cell-related side effects.\" Multiple myeloma, the second most common blood cancer, is a cancer of plasma cells, a white blood cell important in the immune system. The disease's attack on bone marrow puts patients at risk of life-threatening infections. It is diagnosed in more than 32,000 people a year, and African Americans are twice as likely as the general population to be diagnosed with this disease. Three main treatments are available: drugs called proteasome inhibitors, drugs to modulate the immune system, and antibody treatments. Among more than a dozen new therapies for myeloma approved by the Food and Drug Administration over the past decade, most offer only a few months of remission for patients with multiple relapses. Until now, most treatments induced responses in only a third of patients, and complete remissions were rare. The phase 2 trial involved 128 patients, ages 18 and older, who previously had been given regimens from the three main classes of treatment. The clinical trial included nine sites in the U.S., one in Canada, and 10 sites in five European countries. Several patients traveled from as far away as Michigan and Minnesota to UT S outh- western's Dallas campus to be part of the trial. St udy participants had their T-cells engineered to target a molecule called B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, which is only found in plasma cells and myeloma cells. This new T-cell therapy for myeloma patients is called idecabtagene vicleucel, or ide-cel. It is also known as bb2121. The infusions of the engineered cells started a two-week hospitaliza - tion period during which doctors wa tched for possible side effects such as anemia; neutropenia, a drop in a type of white blood cells; and thrombocytopenia, a drop in blood platelets. Although low blood counts were common, they were manageable, and other severe side effects were uncommon. \"One of the nice things we saw in this study was that the rates of severe CAR T -cell-related toxicities - called neurotoxicity and cytokinerelease syndrome - were very low in multiple myeloma comparedto what we have seen with lymphoma CAR T -cell infusions,\" Dr. Anderson said. \"The majority of people had some side effects, butmost were low level and manageable, and I would say this therapy is often much better tolerated than a stem cell transplant, which most of these patients had already gone through.\" Pioneered in the late 1980s, CAR T -cell therapy is a prom - ising and still emerging treatment for blood cancers that involves ha rvesting a patient's own T-cells by withdrawing blood, reengi - neering the T-cells in a lab, and then gr owing millions of them to put back into the patient by infusion. Currently, CAR T- cell therapy is only approved for lymphoma and leukemia. Several different CAR T -cell treatments for myeloma are in clinical trials, but this CAR T -cell treatment is the first to complete and publish data from an FDA registration trial. Based on these results, the pharmaceutical companies Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird bio are seeking FDA approval of ide-cel as a standard therapy for relapsed myeloma. The trial was funded by bluebird bio and Celgene, a Bristol Myers Squibb company. Dr. Anderson is a consultant who serves on an advisory board for Celgene and has other consulting activities disclosed in the manuscript.

Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky, Presi - dent of UT Southwestern, will confer de grees on the Medical School gradu - ates, followed by presentation of the candidates by Dr. Lee. Delivering th e keynote address will be Dr. Helen Hobbs, Director of the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth an d Development, Professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Genetics, and a Howard Hughes Medical Insti - tute (HHMI) Investigator. Dr. Hobbs' re search focuses on the genetic basis of cholesterol metabolism. Dr. Hobbs won international recognition for her discovery that individuals with mutations in the PCSK9 gene have low cholesterol and are protected against heart disease. That discovery led to the develop - ment of a drug to lower treatment-re sistant high cholesterol and prevent heart disease. Many of her discoveries grew out of a large longitudinal study with thou - sands of ethnically diverse partici - pants that she co-founded, called the Da llas Heart Study. Dr. Hobbs has been honored with the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the Institut de France Grand Prix, the Passano Award, and the Harrington Prize for Innovation in Medicine, among others. She is a member of both the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine. At the Graduate School, students, family, and faculty are looking forward to celebrating gradu - ates of both this year and la st, including students who completed dual Ph.D. and M.D. degrees. The combined2019-2020 and 2020-2021 graduate list includes stu-dents from across the U.S. and at least eight foreign countries. Among them are a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, an Indian dance choreographer, a student who has already received several patents for his research, and a former NCAA Division 1 varsity baseball player. Last year's graduates are pursuing diverse science-related careers, including traditional postdoctoral training for academic research jobs as well as employment in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, intellectual property law, clinical research, and bio-technology investment. Dr. Lora Hooper, Chair of Immu -nology, Professor of Immunology and Mi crobiology, and in the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense, will speak at the Graduate School commencement. Her research focuses on the micro - biome living inside the mamma - lian gut and its interactions with the im mune system. She has studied how the intestinal immune system defends against the microbes that inhabit it. Her discoveries have helped explain how a host coexists with the trillions of beneficial bacteria in its intestines. Dr. Hooper's findings show that the microbiome not only affects whether pathogenic microbes in the gut cause infection, but also can deter -mine whether the host is more suscep - tible to disorders such as diabetes, he art disease, and obesity. Dr. Hooper is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an HHMI Investigator. She received the Burroughs Wellcome Career Award in Biomedical Sciences and the Genzyme Award for Thesis Research in Glycobiology. Dr. Hobbs holds the Philip O'Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Chair in Developmental Biology, the Eugene McDermott Distinguished Chair for the St udy of Human Growth and Development, and the 1995 Dallas Heart Ball Chair in Cardi- ology Research. Dr . Hooper holds the Jonathan W. Uhr, M.D. Distinguished Chair in Immunology and is a Nancy Cain and Jeffrey A. Marcus Scholar in Medical Research, in Honor of Dr. Bill S. Vowell Dr. Lee holds the Atticus James Gill, M.D. Chair in Medical Science.

Dr. Helen Hobbs Dr. Lora HooperCommencement Continued from page 1Page 5 May 2021 Dr. Priscilla Tanamal: Class of 2021 Leadership Award Dr. Priscilla Tanamal's interest in medicine and science was clear from an early age. As a kinder - gartner, she was fascinated with the human body a nd quickly leaned toward a medical career. When she shadowed physicians during a college break, her aspirations of becoming a doctor crystallized. What the Leadership Award means: \"I was very excited to take on the role of Class co-President in the beginning of the first year of medical school, but it was a daunting task. Being in leadership, it's not very obvious whether you're doing a good job because it always feels like you could be doing more. What this award means to me is that I fulfilled the duties of my job well and was able to make an impact during my time at this school, and I am so honored.\" Mentor comment: \"Whether it be serving on the LCME Student Committee for our medical school accreditation or our Six-Year Strategic Planning process, your thoughtful ideas, rationed approach, and partnership to help shape UT Southwestern Medical School into the best it can be is greatly appreciated. You have represented the student body so well on the UT System Student Advi -sory Committee, making an impact on how to a pproach issues related to the pandemic. You have also been an incredible role model to the other class leaders in how to address problems, develop trust, and come up with creative solutions. This has been an extraordinary time, and you have met the challenge with extraordinary leadership.\" - Dr. Angela Mihalic, Dean of Medical Students and Associate Dean for Student Affairs Background and family: \"I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas. My parents are both from Bandung, Indonesia, and came to the United States to get their master's degrees and ended up in El Paso, where my dad found a job.\" What led to your career path: \"There are no physi - cians in my family, but growing up surrounded b y a nurturing home and having parents working so hard for my future, I was always striving to do my best. The human body was intriguing to me since a young age, and one summer in college, I realized I wanted to practice medicine because I loved my time shadowing physicians, especially surgeons in the operating room. I came to medical school excited to see what other opportunities I would have for my career path. During my surgery rotation, my love for the field was confirmed and led me to choose general surgery.\" College: \"I earned a Bachelor of Science with High Honors in Advanced Nutritional Sciences at UT Austin. During college, I worked in the Dell Pediatric Research Institute Finnell Lab and the Freshman Research Institute Vertebrate Interac - tome Mapping Lab. I also was a member of Kappa D elta Sorority and UT Club Tennis.\" UTSW activities: \"Besides serving as Class co-Presi - dent, I also was active with the UT System Student A dvisory Council, Gold Humanism Honor Society, Student Leadership Committee, and as a PRE+OP Orientation Committee member, Colleges peer mentor, Human Structures teaching assistant, and COVID-19 student volunteer.\" Surprising fact: \"My first language is Indonesian. \" Future plans: \"I'm excited to go to residency in general surgery at Louisiana State University School of Medicine and can see myself pursuing a fellowship, but I'm not sure yet exactly what I want to specialize in. So far, I loved my experi - ences in vascular, burns, and plastic surgery.\" Dr. Thanos Rossopoulos: Iatros Award The journey to becoming a doctor took an unusual route for Dr. Thanos Rossopoulos, who had worked as an oilfield drilling engineer in India and the Middle East after earning his under - graduate degree in mechanical engineering. T he close friendships he made with co-workers stationed offshore for months along with volun - teer work at a food pantry pulled him toward a n ew career path of service - and the medical field. What this award means: \"It means a lot when my actions have been recognized by my class - mates, and I am honored and blessed that others c onsider me to exemplify the important traits of a physician.

That said, he hasn't shunned diligence and excellence in his medical/clinical education.\" \"I know few people as hardworking and dedicated as this student. On top of all of these things this student is a humble man. He serves because he genuinely cares and wants to make a difference in the community.\" Background and family: \"I am from Southern Cali - fornia. My father is Greek, and my mother is C antonese American. Their work ethics inspire me. I have a younger sister who will be studying occupational therapy next year.\" What led to your career path: \"I was most attracted to medicine because of my desire to have a career helping others in which the interpersonal rela - tionship between provider and patient is at the h eart - something that was absent from my short career as an engineer. My most cherished experiences as an oil engineer were the intimate connections I made with co-workers during my monthlong shifts offshore, and after volun - teering in a food pantry, I sought to develop a c areer in service. My love of science and service intersected perfectly with medicine.\"UTSW activities: \"I founded an expanded student- led program at Union Gospel Mission (UGM) to help individuals struggling with homelessness quit smoking, serving over 300 clients from 2018 through 2019.

She earned her M.P.H. during medical school and has received a Bronze Presidential Service Award.\" - Dr. Zaiba Jetpuri, Associate Professor of Family and Community Medicine Background and family: \"I grew up in Lubbock, Texas. I was raised by a young single mother in occupational therapy school who read anatomy textbooks to me. I'd like to think that is where my interest in medicine began. I am the second doctor of the family, following behind my cousin who is a doctor of physical therapy. Outside of medicine, I love dancing, Texas football, and my two miniature schnauzers.\" What led to your career path: \"Through college and medical school, I was exposed to the many barriers that underserved communities face. This strengthened my interest in helping patients overcome these barriers, specifically through primary care. I chose family medicine because this field supported my passions of patient-centered care, zealous advocacy, and commu - nity service in all stages of a patient's life. As an A frican American woman from West Texas, I did not know many people with a graduate degree who looked like me.\" UTSW activities: \"Post-clerkship, I served as Family Medicine Interest Group (FMIG) Vice Presi - dent, FMIG Coordinator for the Texas Academy o f Family Physicians (TAFP), a Colleges peer mentor, and a Social Determinants of Health Curriculum Reform Committee member.

What this award means: \"It's always nice to be recog - nized, but this award is especially meaningful b ecause it validates the philosophy I have lived by for the past four years - it's more important to take good care of your patients than to make yourself look good on rounds.\" Mentor comment: \"Emily was very strong during her clerkship and actively sought feedback to improve. She consistently would get glowing comments from patients and showed an ability to be empathetic, aware of a patient's social context and physical and emotional needs. She is a hard worker, team player, dependable, honest, and earnest. Her commitment to nutrition and primary care are impressive.\" - Dr. Zaiba Jetpuri, Associate Professor of Family and Community Medicine Background and family: \"I grew up in Kennesaw, Georgia, raised by my two wonderful parents. My parents taught us to work hard. I can't remember a single Saturday that I wasn't scrubbing toilets, pulling weeds, doing laundry, or mudding sheet - rock. At Brigham Young University, I met my h usband through my job teaching Spanish to missionaries. He substituted in my class one summer. We were married the next year, right before medical school, and now have two beau - tiful boys who are ages 2 and 6 months.\" W hat led to your career path: \"Throughout my child - hood, I was the kid who wanted to watch PBS s pecials and Netflix documentaries about natural disasters and public health crises. Something about them really lit my fire and gave me the desire to make a difference in the world. As a teen, I was present for the births of my two youngest brothers. My mom's midwife, Teri, was so inspirational in the way she took care of my mom and educated our whole family about pregnancy and childbirth. In the summers, Teri would travel with her family to do medical missions, which I thought was just amazing. For the longest time, I wanted to be just like her. Somehow, despite all of these early influ - ences, it still took me a long time to realize that m edicine was the right path for me.\" UTSW activities: \"One of my most meaningful experiences has been the opportunity to evaluate a new medical student elective, Culinary Medi - cine. I believe physicians are not getting enough e ducation about nutrition and lifestyle habits that are the root cause of many diseases contributing to morbidity and mortality in our country. We just recently published some of our earliest find - ings and are in the process of evaluating recently c ollected data.\" Surprising fact: \"During high school I danced with the Little General Cloggers, a group from my hometown that performed old-style clogging routines. Every summer we danced at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee.\" Future plans: \"I plan to pursue training in full- scope family medicine, including surgical obstet - rics and lifestyle medicine.\"Dr. Sara Hassan Youssef: Minnie Lancaster, M.D., Scholarship Award in Family Medicine Medicine runs in the family for Dr. Sara Hassan Youssef, whose father completed his resi - dency here at UT Southwestern and inspired h er interest in the field. Dr. Youssef's diverse cultural background played a role in her ability to connect with patients and eventually home in on the field of family medicine. What this award means: \"This award is mean - ingful to me as it emphasizes the importance o f primary care in not only managing medical conditions in the community but also in preventing complex diseases from developing in high-risk patients.\" Mentor comment: \"Sara has been very committed to community service and this has led to a passion in her serving the underserved. She volunteered with several community orga - nizations and became an advocate for those w ith minimal resources. Physicians who have worked with her commented on her work ethic and compassion for patients.\" - Dr. Zaiba Jetpuri, Associate Professor of Family and Community Medicine.Background and family: \"I was born in New York, but moved with my parents to Dallas at the age of 5 for my father's residency in physical medicine and rehabilitation right here at UTSW! My mother is from Guatemala and my father is from Egypt, and I feel so fortunate to have such a unique cultural background as it has allowed me the ability to connect with many people. I recently married my loving husband, who has been a huge part of my support system throughout medical school and who is finishing up his intern year in family medicine.\" What led to your career path: \"Witnessing the joy that my father gets from his career as a physician initially intrigued me to pursue a career in medi - cine myself. Then, as a graduate student in busi - ness school, I was able to learn about the mana - gerial side of health care as well as the shortage o f primary care physicians in our country, which helped shape my commitment to family medi - cine.\" U TSW activities: \"I have held leadership posi - tions with the Pediatric Interest Group and the D ermatology Interest Group. I have volunteered at the Agape Clinic, a medical student-run free clinic, since my first year of medical school. I helped mentor pre-med students through the Pre-Med Mentorship Program as well as the Minority Association of Pre-Medical Students.

This drive carried her forward in school as well, as she excelled in math and science, leading her to college and eventually medical school. The impor - tance of the work and the fast pace drew her to the s pecialty of emergency medicine. What this award means: \"This award is meaningful to me because when I work a shift in the Emer - gency Department, I am genuinely excited to be t here and to engage with and learn from each patient. It's an honor that the attendings and resi - dents with whom I have worked also notice and a ppreciate my effort.\" Mentor comment: \"Carolyn excelled on her emer - gency medicine rotations, impressing all by her d iagnostic acumen, procedural skills, and warm bedside manner.\" - Dr. Christine Kulstad, Asso - ciate Professor of Emergency Medicine B ackground and family: \"I was born and raised in Bettendorf, Iowa. Both of my parents grew up on farms in Iowa, and I got my first job on a horse farm. I do think this first job instilled a work ethic that continues on through my work in medical school and will continue into residency. Math and science were my favorite subjects, and I even skipped a grade in those two subjects, as well as competed on my school's math bee team. I attended Vanderbilt University for undergrad, where I became involved in medical research that propelled my interest in medicine.\" What led to your career path: \"I explored many different fields, but realized that when I was in the Emergency Department, time flew by and I would leave feeling more invigorated by the importance of the work. I loved the challenge of the undif - ferentiated patient, but also loved the connection o f emergency medicine to the community. At Vanderbilt, one of my majors was medicine, health, and society. I spent four years studying topics such as social determinants of health, racial and ethnic health disparities, health care policy, and how health is portrayed in the media. When I worked in the Emergency Department, I saw all of those topics come to life. It confirmed the importance of providing care to patients who do not other - wise have access to medical care and continues t o inspire me to improve health care both in the hospital and out in the community.\" UTSW activities: \"I served as a Reflections Workshop Leader, seniors community Pen Pal Program volun - teer, Meals on Wheels volunteer, and kept active w ith research in multiple publications.\" Surprising fact: \"Before starting medical school, I moved to France and worked as an English tutor. It was an experience that has helped me to connect with people from different cultures and certainly taught me how to explain complex subjects despite language and cultural barriers - which is certainly useful in an emergency department.\" Future plans: \"After my emergency medicine resi - dency, I hope to complete a fellowship. I am i nterested in medical education, ultrasound, and health policy. After fellowship, I plan to work in the community for at least a couple of years. Eventually, I do hope to return to an academic institution to work.\" Dr. Amber Allen Dr. Emily Magallanes Dr. Sara Hassan Youssef Dr. Carolyn Shanks About the award: The TAFP (Texas Academy of Family Physicians) Outstanding Graduate Award is given by the Dallas Chapter to one student annually.About the award: The award is presented to a medical student who demonstrates excellence in emergency medicine, with special dedica - tion to Texans who need emergency care.About the award: Named after the Chair of Family and Community Medicine at UT Southwestern from 1984 to 1993, the Ross Award includes a $1,000 scholar - ship from the Dallas Chapter of the Texas A cademy of Family Physicians Foundation.About the award: The award honors Dr. Lancaster and her husband, Dr. Edgar Lancaster, who in 1953 opened the Grapevine Clinic and Hospital, the first clinic in Grape - vine and the forerunner of Baylor Scott & W hite Medical Center at Grapevine.Page 7 May 2021 Dr. Bradley Upchurch: Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Award As if graduating from medical school wasn't hard enough, Dr. Bradley Upchurch overcame a few more challenges this past year. He married his wife in a small ceremony due to the pandemic and also dealt with contracting COVID-19 himself within a day of getting a new dog. But, given he decided to focus on emergency medi - cine as a specialty, it seems obstacles are no m atch for Dr. Upchurch. What this award means: \"To receive this award reaf - firms the superior mentorship I have received w ithin the Emergency Medicine department as well as the extensive support from friends and family that have allowed me to enter the hospital daily with renewed passion and resolve to work harder than the day before and approach each patient with compassion.\" Mentor comment: \"Brad has been involved in our Department since his preclinical years, consistently exhibiting intelligence, hard work, and determina - tion. I expect him to be a success in the field of e mergency medicine.\" - Dr. Christine Kulstad, Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine B ackground and family: \"Growing up in East Texas was filled with many weekends of team sports, hunting, hiking, golf, and long summer days with friends and family. I also had the opportunity to travel to Ecuador, Nigeria, Romania, and Malawi for humanitarian and medical mission trips with my family. The most consistent and important theme of my upbringing and background is my involvement and dedication to my local church and Christian community that has supported me every step of the way. During the beginning of the pandemic, I was also able to marry my wife, Jaclyn, in a small ceremony with family. \" What led to your career path: \"I grew up surrounded by emergency medicine since my dad and family friends are EM physicians. Though I knew very early in middle school and high school that I wanted to pursue a career in medicine, I sought out basic research positions in college to determine if I would pursue my M.D. or Ph.D. Quickly, I determined medicine to be my future and was blessed to have the chance to train at my father's alma mater - UT Southwestern (Dr. Stan Upchurch, '92). During medical school, I found the Emergency Department to be the place that I most enjoyed in the hospital due to the team emphasis, large breadth of pathology, diversity of patients, and need for timely interventions and decision-making.\" UTSW activities: \"I have been involved in starting a new medical student elective on wilderness, sports, aerospace, and military medicine for pre-clerkship students. I also have spent much of my time on EM research, focusing on new ultrasound methods in cardiac arrests as well as putting new resources together for future EM-bound medical students.\" Surprising fact: \"I completed a half-marathon, hiked the Boulder Skyline Traverse, and scored my first 'hole-in-one,' all within 96 hours in three different states.\" Dr. Naveen Kishore Balakrishnan and Dr. Calvin Geng: Dr. Richard Mays Smith Award As the son of Indian immigrants, Dr. Naveen Kishore Balakrishnan always felt drawn to diverse patient populations. During his medical educa - tion, he sought out experiences involving commu - nity health research that included working with t he homeless or those with psychiatric issues. Ultimately, his goal is to work in internal medi - cine and assist underserved populations. What this award means: \"I hope to be at the fron - tiers of internal medicine care and serve under - served populations. To receive an award from my r ole models who have previously given this award to students I've looked up to is quite possibly the second best affirmation of my efforts that I could receive right now (after making my parents proud, of course!).\" Mentor comment: \"Naveen is a well-rounded student with a strong foundation of clinical skills and an earnest communication style that makes patients feel comfortable - allowing him to deliver evidence-based, personalized care. Inducted into the Gold Humanism Honor Society, Naveen is invested in addressing social barriers to care and strives to work with disad - vantaged communities. Naveen has a bright f uture ahead of him, and we are grateful for the opportunity to continue to watch him grow in the next three years as a resident at UTSW!\" - Dr. Ahmad Anshasi, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine Background and family: \"I was born in Croydon, the United Kingdom, to two Indian immigrant parents. I have a younger sister, and we all moved to the United States when I was 7. I've lived in Rhode Island, Texas, and England.\" What led to your career path: \"As the son of a physician and due to personal medical experiences, I found myself interested in medicine. Meeting people from different walks of life, learning to recognize my privilege, and learning to process my own identities and experiences as an immigrant really helped me develop a passion for serving underserved popula - tions. I spent medical school obtaining experiences t hat might help me become a leader in bringing equity and justice to our communities, and I believe I can do that in internal medicine.\" UTSW activities: \"I helped create a hepatitis C screening program with linkage-to-care at the local homeless men's shelter. I also helped grow the student advocacy group (now Student Patient Advocates for the Rights of our Communities, or SPARC) and learned about community-based participatory research, for which I'll graduate with a distinction in community health. I also served as a Gold Humanism Honor Society co-Chair for the Humanism elective, which is open to all UTSW professions schools.\" Surprising fact: \"I used to play competitive chess nationally and was ranked in the top 100 for my age. I went on to represent my undergrad class at the pan-collegiate tournament, and I wish I had more time to dedicate to chess.\" Future plans: \"I hope to serve underserved popula - tions at an academic center in an inpatient care s etting. I hope to teach and to continue commu - nity-based participatory research.\"As a child of Chinese immigrants, Dr. Calvin Geng appreciates the educational opportuni - ties available in the U.S. He dove full force into a cademics, graduating with a degree in biology through a combined program between UT Dallas and UT Southwestern that afforded provisional acceptance to UT Southwestern Medical School. What this award means: \"I feel extremely grateful to have mentors and classmates who led by example and demonstrated the power of empathy, compassion, and intellectual curiosity.

The next fall, in 2013, she entered the University of Texas at Dallas as a biology major at age 16, and her trips increased to Tuesdays and Thursdays. Soon she began accompanying Dr. Matthew Pompeo to the surgical suite to watch when - ever she could. S he vividly remembers her first surgical observation. Dr. Pompeo, a general surgeon affiliated with Texas Health Dallas, specializes in wound care for diabetic patients, Dr. Houshmand said - which means he d oes a lot of amputations. \"It was a below-the-knee ampu - tation,\" she recalled, and she was s tanding right next to the patient. \"My reaction was probably shock at first, but it quickly turned into fascination. I just thought, 'Wow. He saw a problem and he solved it.'\" \"I could see myself doing some - thing that direct and concrete - being a ble to see a problem and, as a surgeon does, take care of that problem. Dr. Pompeo did seem a little impressed that I didn't pass out.\" Dr. Houshmand graduated magna cum laude from UTD in 2017 and was accepted to the Medical School, where her experiences with Dr. Pompeo gave her a head start in anatomy class and when treating clinic patients with diabetes. \"I knew how devastating it could be on the other end,\" she said. After graduation, Dr. Houshmand will begin a general surgery residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Balti - more. Later, she hopes to complete a s urgical critical care fellowship.Such surgeons often work in emer - gency rooms, tending to patients who n eed immediate attention for gunshot wounds, traffic accidents, falls - or acute appendicitis, she said. Because of the intellectual challenge from the wide range of injuries treated and the need to act quickly, this type of surgery appeals to her. \"Trauma surgeons have to be ready for anything that comes through the door,\" she said. Dr. Houshmand said one day she would like to work at a large academic medical center like UT Southwestern, treating patients, teaching, and conducting research. During her time at UTSW, Dr. Houshmand served as a Vice Presi - dent for the UT Southwestern Chapter o f the American Medical Women's Association. She completed additional work in order to earn a distinctionin quality improvement and patient safety along with her medical degree. \"Southwestern Medical Foundation Trustees take great pride in awarding the Ho Din Award to a student who inspires us with both demonstrated medical wisdom and a passion for the betterment of humanity,\" said Kathleen M. Gibson, President and C EO of Southwestern Medical Foun - dation. \"Natasha Houshmand is a w onderful embodiment of this combi - nation of intellectual and personal s kill, which will no doubt change the trajectory of the many lives she will touch for the better.\" Besides the Ho Din Award, Dr. Houshmand also received the Hudson-Penn Award, given by the Department of Surgery to a senior medical student whose performance in surgery and attitude toward the care of surgical patients represent the highest stan -dards of the Medical School. The prize, e stablished in 1979, was named for the Lee Hudson and Robert Penn families. \"Natasha Houshmand has all the qualities that we seek to foster in future surgeons: proclivity for tech - nical work, the restless intellect of a scholar, passion for the field, and empathy for patients,\" said Dr. Herbert Zeh, Chair of Surgery. The two awards are humbling for Dr. Houshmand. \"Receiving this recognition for doing the work that I love doing and I have enjoyed doing ... I feel very lucky and very, very humbled t o be in this position,\" she said. Dr. Zeh holds the Hall and Mary Lucile Shannon Distinguished Univer - sity Chair in Surgery.

In 2009, he received the prestigious Castroviejo Medal, one of the world's top ophthalmology prizes. Ten years later, he received the R. Townley Paton Award, the Eye Bank Association of America's highest honor for corneal physicians. He also was honored by Southwestern Medical Foundation that year with creation of a corneal disease and t ransplantation lectureship in his name. The Atlanta native said he was inspired to go into science after the 1957 launch of Sputnik, the Soviet Union's first satellite, while he was in high school. Dr. Cavanagh entered the Massachusetts Insti - tute of Technology, initially thinking he would b e a physicist, but soon gravitated to biology and medicine instead. \"I really liked the idea of going to medical school and being a scientist-clinician,\" he said. Arriving at UT Southwestern, with its depth of excellence, felt like coming home, he said. \"Through the years, I had the privilege of being around some really outstanding clinicians at Harvard, Hopkins, and here,\" he said. Working at UT Southwestern \"was a lot of fun,\" he said recently. \"We did a lot of good in the world and we trained a lot of really good people around the world.\" Dr. McCulley holds The David Bruton, Jr. Chair in Ophthalmology. Dr. H. Dwight Cavanagh: First ophthalmologist at UTSW to hold esteemed title Dr. H. Dwight Cavanagh By Lori Sundeen Soderbergh In 1978, Dr. Arthur Sagalowsky completed his residency at Indiana University Medical Center and joined the urology team at UT S outhwestern. He chose to focus on urologic oncology - cancer of the genitourinary tract - even though many developments in modern cancer care, such as techniques of molecular biology and immuno - therapy, were far in the future. F orty-two years later, Dr. Sagalowsky has retired and, effective earlier this year, was appointed Professor Emeritus of Urology. Along the way, he kept a handwritten logbook of more than 8,000 surgeries, many of them complex procedures. \"Few physicians, if any, will match the sheer scope of work done by Arthur Sagalowsky on this campus, the breadth of the disease spectrum, the academic impact, and the illustrious, long years of service to the community, Depart - ment of Urology, insti - tution, and urology a s a specialty,\" said Dr. Claus Roehrborn, Chair of Urology. \"He is the last bridge to the early days of the fledgling UT Southwestern division from the 1970s to the modern Department of Urology as it is today.\" Dr. Sagalowsky served as Chief of Urologic Oncology from 1994 to 2011, and he joined the Southwest Oncology Group Urologic Cancer Outreach Program, which opened the way for campus participation in multicenter National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported clinical trials in genitourinary cancer. Dr. Sagalowsky made contributions at both ends of the spectrum of kidney cancer. He was one of the early proponents of kidney-sparing partial nephrectomy (carving the tumor out of the kidney) for the great majority of patients with localized kidney cancers. He also created a team approach involving cardiac surgery and cardiac anesthesia for safe removal of locally advanced kidney cancers that have a tumor clot growing out the renal vein and even up into the heart. His contributions for bladder cancer patients include advancement of clinical trials for instilla - tion of medications into the bladder for patients w ith noninvading cancers, and preoperative chemotherapy for patients with muscle-invading cancers. He was one of the first urologists to create internal continent urinary diversion \"neoblad - ders,\" using part of the intestine for selected p atients who require bladder removal. Throughout his career, Dr. Sagalowsky has been heavily involved in all levels of education for medical students, residents, fellows, and colleagues. He was Master of Cary College from 2011 until his recent retirement and has trained 150 residents in urology. These days, Dr. Sagalowsky enjoys spending more time with his wife, two children, and four grandchildren. This surgeon's hands will also keep busy with other delicate tasks. \"I'm fasci - nated by classical music and fly fishing. I love m usic and started piano lessons at age 6. Now I hope to play piano, read, and fly fish more often.\" Dr. Roehrborn holds the E. E. Fogelson and Greer Garson Fogelson Distinguished Chair in Urology and the S.T.

This pattern of biological processes - known as circadian rhythms - can have a substantial impact on the health of humans and other species. For the past five years, postdoctoral researcher Dr. Filipa Rijo-Ferreira has been immersed in this intriguing line of investigation, focusing on the circa - dian clocks of the human parasites T rypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium . For her efforts, she has received the Brown-Goldstein Award for Excellence in Postdoctoral Research, the highest honor bestowed by the UT South - western Graduate School of Biomed - ical Sciences. The award honors the c ontributions of Nobel Laureates Drs. Michael Brown and UTSW Medical School alumnus Joseph Goldstein to training future scientists. Dr. Rijo-Ferreira began working in the laboratory of world-renowned circadian rhythm researcher Dr. Joseph Takahashi as a doctoral student - not at UT Southwestern, but through a unique graduate program in biology at the University of Porto in Portugal. The program provides students with a stipend to study at a laboratory anywhere in the world. Before that, she had worked as a technician in a laboratory that studies how T. brucei , the sleeping sickness parasite, infects its victims - including the role of its circadian rhythms. She reached out to Dr. Takahashi, Chair and Professor of Neuroscience at UT Southwestern, whose three- decadeslong career has focused on circadian rhythms in mammals. \"It's not just about aligning interests,\" Dr. Rijo-Ferreira said. \"Joe is a very curious person who's willing to explore other directions of research, but he's also extremely generous, providing mentorship and the space for me to explore my own interests. I really hit the bull's-eye when I joined his lab.\" Working with Dr. Takahashi and her University of Porto mentor Dr. Luisa Figueiredo, Dr. Rijo-Ferreira showed that T. brucei 's metabolism is controlled by circadian rhythms. The researchers learned that sleeping sick - ness is a circadian disorder, with the p arasite's clock impacting the host's circadian rhythm. After Dr. Rijo-Ferreira finished her doctoral program in 2016, she stayed in Dr. Takahashi's lab as a postdoc - toral fellow, turning her attention to a d ifferent fatal parasite: Plasmodium , a group of single-celled eukaryotes that cause malaria. One of malaria's key symptoms is rhythmic fevers that typically come and go in vari - ants of 24 hours, such as every day or e very two days. Drs. Rijo-Ferreira and Takahashi suspected that the para - site had its own rhythmicity, just like T . brucei .The researchers confirmed this hypothesis using mice with altered circadian rhythms. Some mouse lines bred to study circadian rhythms have cycles that are longer or shorter than 24 hours. When the researchers infected animals with a 26-hour cycle with Plasmodium , they saw that the parasites' own patterns of gene activity did not adjust right away - although they seemed to be taking cues from the host, Plasmodium had their own independent rhythm. They then infected mice with no circadian rhythms and found about 60 percent of Plasmodium 's genes continued to cycle every 24 hours, suggesting that these parasites have an inherent clock that functions independently of the host's patterns. Understanding parasites' clocks could lead to more effective treat - ments for humans, Dr. Rijo-Ferreira s aid. In fact, her research with Dr. Takahashi showed that T. brucei can be effectively killed in culture with 2.5 times less suramin - a medication frequently used to treat sleeping sick - ness - when delivered at a certain time o f day. Because treatment for sleeping sickness can be extremely toxic, being able to deliver less medicine with the same efficacy could save more lives. Dr. Rijo-Ferreira noted that although all life on Earth appears to have circa - dian cycles, these cycles can differ si gnificantly - for example, bacteria circadian clocks use different molecular mechanisms than human ones. Capital - izing on this effect could lead to drugs t hat effectively target parasites while sparing treatment side effects. \"There are so many questions that remain in this area: the molecular mechanisms behind other parasites' circadian clocks, the vectors' circadian clocks, and how interacts with humans' circadian clocks,\" Dr. Rijo-Ferreira said. \"These mysteries will continue to fuel my career far into the future.\" The Brown-Goldstein Award includes a monetary prize as well as the opportunity to present a Univer - sity Lecture. Dr. Rijo-Ferreira's virtual s eminar, \"Circadian Rhythms in Para - sitic Diseases: An Underlying Clock o f Malaria Parasites,\" was held on Thursday, April 29.In addition, award finalists Dr. Jessalyn Ubellacker and UTSW Graduate School alumnus Dr. Bryan Gibson, postdoctoral scholars in the Children's Medical Center Research Institute at UT Southwestern and the Department of Biophysics, respectively, received Dean's Discretionary Awards for their outstanding research.

Led by Dr. Megan Sorich, who had fellowship training in orthopedic geriatric trauma, RESTORE is the only program in North Texas focusing on the musculoskeletal health of older people and consoli - dates clinical efforts across UTSW departments i ncluding Geriatric Medicine, Internal Medicine, Emer - gency Medicine, Anesthesiology and Pain Manage - ment, Clinical Nutrition, a nd Physical Therapy. RESTORE launched on Feb. 1, shortly after the opening of the third tower at William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital, and provides coordinated care to improve outcomes and reduce hospital stays for UTSW patients - from initial onboarding through recovery and follow-up care. \"The Program's goal is to provide the best comprehensive collabor-ative co-managed care of the older adult with an orthopedic injury. We have teamed up to help standardize patient care, expedite patients to the OR and, ultimately, improve outcomes,\" said Dr. Sorich, an Assistant Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery who specializes in geriatric trauma as well as elbow and shoulder procedures. The costly toll of hip fractures The medical needs of geriatric patients are growing. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2030, 71 million Americans will be older than 65, accounting for 20 percent of the population. Hip fractures are the most costly of fall-related breaks in older adults, common events associated with significant morbidity and mortality. More than 300,000 people are hospitalized for hip fractures annually in the U.S., and those older than 65 years of age represent 86 percent of these cases. Most geriatric hip fracture patients are hospitalized and undergo surgery. Several studies have shown hospitalization costs to be the largest expenses associated with hip fracture care, averaging 44 to 57 percent of costs. Leading medical institutions have worked to identify opportunities to improve the quality of care while decreasing costs through collaborative co-managed models like RESTORE.In general, these new treatment models stan - dardize the approach to geriatric patients through f ive principles: surgical fracture management; priori - tized operative intervention; medical co-management w ith patient-centered evidence-based guidelines to increase workflow effi - ciencies and reduce medication errors; and proactive d ischarge planning with a focus on rehabilitation. Specialized care for specialized patients Many older fracture patients have multiple medical comorbidities such as cardiac or pulmonary disease, dementia, diabetes, and renal impairment that often are not adequately assessed in the tradi - tional care model. Postop - erative issues such as osteo - porosis challenges and c oncerns, the inability or unwillingness of patients to take on long-term phys - ical therapy, and the lack o f focus on scheduling and follow-up care can be highly debilitating while hampering recovery. In many cases, one incident leads to other medical chal - lenges that result in loss of f unctional independence and higher postoperative mortality rates. The RESTORE Program addresses these issues by identifying needs and coordinating care. Elderly patients who arrive at the emergency room at Clements University Hospital receive expedited care, including consultation from both geriatric and orthopedic teams. A pain manage - ment program that focuses on non-narcotic medi - cine may be used to reduce delirium, a common si de effect from fragility fracture treatments in older people. After treatment, nutritionists provide dietary guidance, and follow-up visits are scheduled to help prevent future falls. \"Generally, hospital sys- tems and individual ortho - pedic surgeons have not b een specifically focused on improving care of our aging population,\" Dr. Sorich said. \"Previously at UT South - western, if a patient had a hip f racture they normally arrived and were processed through Clements' ED and then got transported to Zale Lipshy Pavilion. With RESTORE, we will have operating room space at Clements University Hospital and trained geriatric/orthopedic physicians and nurses to help care for these patients.\"RESTORE Program provides special care for seniors with fractures Dr. Megan SorichDecades of health, days of need The RESTORE Program will effectively provide centralized orthopedic services to patients such as William \"Bill\" Lawson, 96, and his wife, Jane, 95, who required identical surgical procedures after falling within a week of one another last year. The Lawsons, New York state natives, have routinely been patients of Drs. Tara Duval and UTSW Medical School alumna Jessica Voit, both UTSW Assistant Profes - sors of Internal Medicine, since moving to T exas a couple of years ago. In the autumn of 2020, Mrs. Lawson fell at her assisted living facility and needed surgical help. Within four days, Mr. Lawson also was admitted to Zale Lipshy Pavilion-William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital following a tumble of his own. \"They both sustained right displaced femoral neck fractures,\" said Dr. Megan Sorich, Assistant Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery. \"Jane came in on a Monday night and had surgery Tuesday. That same week, Bill came in on Friday and had his surgery on Saturday.\" Dr. Sorich performed both cemented hip hemiarthroplasties, procedures in which half of the hip joint is replaced. Overall, cemented fixation has shown a better long-term survivorship in older patients. The couple has since been going through physical therapy, although Mr. Lawson had a setback with a subsequent fall. \"Our whole family is so grateful for the work and compassion that Dr. Sorich and her team have always delivered and shown to our parents,\" said son Bill Lawson of Garland. Bill and Jane Lawson (sitting in center) celebrate with family at a grandson's wedding in 2018. The couple had identical surgical hip procedures after falling within a week of one another last year. The Program's goal is to provide the best comprehensive collaborative co-managed care of the older adult with an ortho - pedic injury. We have teamed up t o help standardize patient care, expedite patients to the OR and, ultimately, improve outcomes - Dr. Megan Sorich\"\" \"Our ability to quickly vaccinate a majority of our workforce in the midst of what became the largest surge to date in the region made a critical difference in ensuring we were able to continue providing top-flight care while health systems were strained,\" said Dr. John Warner, Executive Vice President for Health System Affairs. Researchers even saw advantages among partially vaccinated individuals and, beginning in mid-January one month after vaccination of staff initially began, the actual number of positive tests among all UT Southwestern employees was consistently lower than the number projected. UT Southwestern is now approaching 80 percent immunization among its workforce. \"Real-world experience with SARS- CoV-2 vaccination at UT Southwestern demonstrated marked reduction in the incidence of infections among our employees, preserving the workforce when it was most needed,\" said Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky, President of UT Southwestern and an author of the article. UT Southwestern has provided educational outreach to community groups and businesses, developed exten - sive online resources including Q&As a nd blogs, and is preparing to launch a multilingual public service announce - ment campaign to help educate diverse c ommunities about vaccination and address issues of hesitancy. \"It is important to reach out across multiple platforms to effectively address people's questions so that we can continue to make progress on vaccine hesitancy,\" said Dr. Marc Nivet, Executive Vice Presi - dent for Institutional Advancement.

Because of the g enerosity of so many, that work will continue here and be forever associated with her legacy.\" The endowment will be invested by UT Southwestern, and only part of the interest earnings will be spent each year, enabling the fund to grow over time. Distributions will support the endowed chair holder's clinical research activities in radiation oncology. A passion for cancer research Mr. Roy, who is Vice President of Product Management with the E.F. Johnson Co. in Irving, confessed he had a hard time understanding the complexities of his wife's work. \"But I never underestimated her passion for cancer research and her devotion to her colleagues and UT Southwestern as a whole,\" he said. A native of Sindri, India, Ms. Sen was an avid gardener and trained singer of Indian classical music. A graduate of UT Dallas and the Univer - sity of Alabama at Birmingham, she w as a pharmacist and researcher who studied molecular biology. Her family inspired her commitment to cancer research and treatment. \"Her own mother was a breast cancer survivor, so her work hit very close to home for her,\" Mr. Roy said. Dr. Hak Choy hired Ms. Sen to direct clinical research in UT Southwestern's Department of Radiation Oncology. \"From the start, I found her to be one of the kindest, most caring, and thoughtful people you'd ever meet in our field,\" said Dr. Choy, the Depart - ment's Chairman and a Professor of R adiation Oncology. Ms. Sen, respected and beloved, had a devotion to the Department where she worked for almost four years that often extended beyond the workday. As a clinician, what impressed Dr. Choy most was Ms. Sen's ability to collect and analyze all manner of clin - ical trial data from patients. \" She brought such care and compassion to her work,\" Dr. Choy said. \"From the moment she arrived, the amount of clinical research we were able to do grew considerably.\" When asked about the impact that the Sen Chair will have on the Depart -ment, Dr. Choy was heartfelt in his r esponse: \"We are very grateful to Ms. Sen's family,\" he said. \"While grieving the loss of a loved one, they wanted to support clinical research in memory of Ms. Sen.\" Such generosity will also help UT South - western grow its research capabilities. \"Establishing an endowed chair helps us recruit and retain even more leading clinical research faculty,\" said Dr. Choy. \"It adds prestige and makes the position even more meaningful.\" Dr. Choy returns to reflecting on the gift's greater meaning to Ms. Sen's family and friends as well as her colleagues who continue the work she was so committed to at UT Southwestern. \"This endowment makes Ms. Sen's name and her institutional legacy eternal. For that alone, I hope she is looking down on us and smiling.\" Dr. Choy holds The Nancy B. and Jake L. Hamon Distinguished Chair in Therapeutic Oncology Research. Dr. Podolsky holds the Philip O'Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Presidential Chair in Academic Administration, and the Doris and Bryan Wildenthal Distin - guished Chair in Medical Science.Arindam Roy and his late wife, Sarmistha Sen, are pictured here with their children during a family vacation. Ms. Sen, a cancer researcher for the Department of Radiation Oncology, was killed last year near her home in Plano. From loss to legacy UTSW cancer researcher's tragic death inspires family to establish Chair in her honor By Andrew Marton On Aug. 1, 2020, Arindam Roy's life tragically changed forever. His wife, Sarmistha Sen, a cancer researcher in UT Southwestern's Department of Radia - tion Oncology, left for her customary e arly morning jog. She never returned. Police found her body later that morning. The 43-year-old had been attacked and killed on a trail not far from the Plano home she shared with her husband and two sons. The next morning, hours after his family's lives were shattered, Mr. Roy began the healing process. His wife's story was covered by the local media and people were starting to reach out, asking what they could do to help. Working to make sure something positive came out of this unspeakable tragedy, Mr. Roy set up an online fund - raising campaign for charities devoted to i ssues that Ms. Sen deeply cared about, including cancer awareness, cancer research, and healthy living. What began as a humble remem - brance to honor his wife of 16 years led t o an overwhelming response from colleagues, family, friends, and the general public. In total, 683 people contributed to the effort that raised $50,000 - far more than the family ever anticipated. \"This fundraising effort may have been an important first step for all of us to recover from such a terrible tragedy,\" Mr. Roy said. \"It became a truly beautiful community response.\" He was so moved that he matched the total with funds from his own savings. He donated the gifts to UT Southwestern to create the Sarmistha Sen Chair in Radia - tion Oncology. UT Southwestern also c ontributed institutional funds to the new endowment.By Patrick Wascovich In recognition of outstanding teaching, UT System's Kenneth I.
