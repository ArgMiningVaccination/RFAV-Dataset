More than 4.5 million people are bitten by dogs each year in the United States, and more than 800,000 receive medical attention for dog bites, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). At least half of those bitten are children. Here are more dog bite facts: - Almost 1 in 5 people bitten by dogs require medical attention. - Children are the most common victims of dog bites and are far more likely to be severely injured. - Most dog bites affecting young children occur during everyday activities and while interacting with familiar dogs. Any dog can bite: big or small, male or female, young or old. Even the cuddliest, fuzziest, sweetest pet can bite if provoked. Remember, [it is not a dog's breed](/resources/pet-owners/why-breed-specific-legislation-not-answer) that determines whether it will bite, but rather the dog's individual history and behavior. Most dog bites are preventable, and there are many things you can do at home and within your community to help prevent them. Why do dogs bite? Dogs bite for a variety of reasons, but most commonly as a reaction to something. If the dog finds itself in a stressful situation, it may bite to defend itself or its territory. Dogs can bite because they are scared or have been startled. They can bite because they feel threatened. They can bite to protect something that is valuable to them, like their puppies, their food or a toy. Dogs might bite because they aren't feeling well. They could be sick or sore due to injury or illness and might want to be left alone. Dogs also might nip and bite during play. Even though nipping during play might be fun for the dog, it can be dangerous for people. It's a good idea to avoid wrestling or playing tug-of-war with your dog. These types of activities can make your dog overly excited, which may lead to a nip or a bite.
