During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, that popularity grew even further\u2014so much so that [one-third of all adults](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db399.htm) over 20 said they take at least one such supplement. To meet this unprecedented demand, countless multivitamin brands have sprung up over the past decade, each claiming a better formula or method of manufacturing than the last. And, while clever branding, social media campaigns, and convoluted ingredient lists may drive sales, they also add to the decision fatigue that's all too common when trying to find the right supplements for your health needs. Luckily, the industry has begun course-correcting to match consumer demand. Honest brands (among which we like to include ourselves!) have started prioritizing clarity and simplicity in their products and marketing. To support this cause, we've exhaustively researched two of the most popular daily multivitamins on the market: KaraMD Pure Nature and Balance of Nature. While we value your business and fully believe in our products, our primary goal is always better health for everyone in our communities\u2014even if that comes at the expense of our bottom line. That's why we want to give you the tools you need to decide for yourself which product is best for your health goals. In this article, we'll break down each product's strengths, weaknesses, and points of interest, comparing one to the other in areas such as cost, vitamin diversity, and immune support. Then, we'll also give an honest assessment of how [Ens Supergreens](https://ensosuperfoods.com/products/supergreens) might be a better choice to supply your daily dose of vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients. Quick Comparison KaraMD Pure Nature Overview KaraMD is a doctor-developed supplement made by Dr. Mahmud Kara, an internal medicine specialist with over 30 years of experience. KaraMD Pure Nature includes 20 organic, whole-food products in a two-part formula: Pure Greens and Fruits & Vegetables. A serving is four capsules, which consumers take once a day with 8 ounces of water. Four pills may seem like a lot, but compared to Balance of Nature, KaraMD Pure Nature is the better choice if you want to minimize the number of multivitamins you consume. The product description on the company website provides consumers with limited information. There are general statements about fruits and vegetables providing your body with \"key nutrients\" that it needs to perform well, and it seems that the capsules were designed to help those who can't access their essential nutrients through whole foods. Pure Nature uses a secret formula and doesn't say what vitamins and minerals it contains. The nutritional label only states the ingredients in each blend and how much sugar and carbohydrates are in a serving. There are some added ingredients as well, including vegetable cellulose, maltodextrin, and silicon dioxide. It advertises the inclusion of superfoods, namely beets, carrots, and garlic, as being good for heart health, cognitive function, and immunity. While this can be true, it's impossible to determine how many of these ingredients are in the formula and whether or not there is a sufficient amount to have any positive effects. What is KaraMD Pure Nature? Dr. Kara is an internal medicine physician who founded KaraMD in 2017. The company offers a collection of supplements and products designed to support health across many domains, including gut health, mental health, hydration, energy, and muscle and joint health. The main selling point of KaraMD Pure Nature is that it's a doctor-formulated fruit and vegetable blend with a few superfoods. This can help people meet their daily dietary needs without spending more money on fresh produce. While the ambition is admirable, the lack of clarity and nutritional value makes it hard for anyone to determine whether Pure Nature would be a good product for them. |Pros||Cons| | || | Bottom Line: While the organic ingredients are a plus, KaraMD Pure Nature doesn't have enough nutrient-rich ingredients to deliver a sufficient daily dose of the essential vitamins and minerals your body needs to fill any dietary gaps or see noticeable benefits. Balance of Nature Overview Helping to better the lives of its customers since 1997, [Balance of Nature](https://www.balanceofnature.com/products?details=fruits-veggies) offers three core products: - Fruits capsules - Veggies capsules - Fiber and Spice blend The multivitamin company uses a unique dehydration method to capture as many nutrients as possible from fresh produce for use in powdered form. The Fruits and Veggies capsules are sold in a joint package with a recommendation to take 3 of each fruit and vegetable supplement daily, which would mean one of each at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Balance of Nature's fruit and veggie supplements include blends of 16 and 15 natural ingredients, respectively, to provide some of the vitamins and minerals you need in your diet. Although neither type of capsule is designed to replace meals, its formulas are broken down into three distinct blends, each with a unique focus: maintain, protect, and repair. Some of the ingredients in these blends overlap, but none of them are the nutrient-dense superfoods you need to get a major dose of vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients (except for broccoli and kale) Balance of Nature has a long history of positive reviews, and their products are third-party tested and vegan-friendly. Unfortunately, the company does not have a good manufacturing reputation. The Food and Drug Administration has reprimanded it for poor quality control, faulty production practices, and misleading ingredients. For example, FDA inspectors who reviewed their facility found that Balance of Nature marketed its Fruits & Veggies capsules as including \"yam,\" but the inspected batch actually had \"wild yam,\" which is a different ingredient. The company was also reprimanded for not labeling its products correctly since it does not provide information about the daily recommended intake of the vitamins in its supplements. Although the company claims to provide numerous benefits, such as greater immunity, its nutritional label and website don't disclose exactly how many vitamins or minerals they provide. What is Balance of Nature? [Balance of Nature](https://www.balanceofnature.com/products?details=fruits-veggies) is a long-time supplement brand that offers fruits and vegetables in capsules created with their cold-vacuum process. Dr. Douglas Howard founded the business and created the distinctive dehydration technique that it still uses today. In addition to its fruit and vegetable supplements, the company also sells a Fiber and Spice blend that contains apples, seeds, nuts, and grains. They claim that the greatest health benefits come from taking all three of their products together, which is a convenient way for them to sell more dietary supplements per customer. While they use natural products, Balance of Nature's lack of transparency makes it hard to determine just how effective their supplements are and whether these supplements would significantly contribute to a healthy diet. |Pros||Cons| | || | Bottom Line: Although they've been in business for many years, [Balance of Nature](https://www.balanceofnature.com/products?details=fruits-veggies) does not offer enough nutritional information to recommend them as a multivitamin or dietary supplement. Given the price, you could easily use the same money to purchase a much better alternative or even fresh produce to boost your dietary intake. Ens Superfoods Overview Inspired by the natural beauty and abundance of his native Brazil, Haim Nigri founded [Ens Superfoods](https://ensosuperfoods.com/products/supergreens) in 2021 to address what he saw as a growing problem in the supplement industry. Rather than focusing on the naturally-occurring nutrients of high-quality, organic produce, many supplement companies have begun filling their products with synthetic vitamins or unnecessary levels of minerals. To Haim, depending on artificial ingredients and fillers means a brand isn't confident in the quality of its own natural ingredients. So, along with other like-minded entrepreneurs, Haim created Ens Superfoods and began formulating the products we offer today. In developing these supplements, simplicity was at the forefront of every decision. Our philosophy is that as long as Ens Superfoods thoughtfully chose each ingredient, focused on the delicate balance between those ingredients, and sourced everything from quality, organic farms, we'd end up with products we could be proud of. That philosophy worked. Today, we offer three unique blends of organic superfoods, each specifically designed to enhance a different area of your life. Our most popular product, Ens Supergreens, blends 20+ high-potency superfoods like spirulina, kale, and dandelion leaf with powerful probiotics and digestive enzymes to provide a full nutrient profile. For those needing better athletic performance, a cognitive boost, or both, our Power Beets formula features antioxidant powerhouses and adaptogens like cordyceps and lion's mane to improve circulation, reduce stress, and boost brain function. Finally, Ens's Recharge powder uses time-tested spices such as organic turmeric, cardamom, and maca root to stabilize energy levels, improve sleep quality, and fight back against inflammation from [sources like stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491771/#:~:text=Heightened%20inflammation%20and%20negative%20attentional,Slavich%20and%20Irwin%2C%202014).) or poor diets. Although all three of these products provide different health benefits and uses, every product we make undergoes extensive third-party testing and quality control to ensure they contain zero contamination from pesticides, heavy metals, or other unwanted additives. Taking this one step further, Ens Superfoods sources all of its ingredients from organic farmers from around the world, and we manufacture all of our products in U.S. facilities. Because we value your trust, and we'll work hard to deserve it. What Is Ens Supergreens? Like most super greens powders, [Ens Supergreens](https://ensosuperfoods.com/products/supergreens) combines concentrated doses of whole fruits, vegetables, and greens to help you meet your daily recommended allowance of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Unlike other super greens powders, Ens Supergreens designs its formula to occupy the space where simplicity meets efficacy. That means no unnecessary mega-doses, no ingredient stuffing, and no artificial vitamins to pad our labels. Instead, each package of Ens Supergreens contains a carefully-balanced blend of 20+ of the most researched, time-tested superfoods and other ingredients. To start, we based our formula on a solid foundation of blue-green algae like spirulina and bioavailable chlorella, both of which provide complex proteins, regulate blood sugar, and provide a [host of other benefits.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576896/) From that foundation, we added complementary ingredients with specific health goals in mind. For gut health and digestion, we used a healthy dose of digestive enzymes like papain and bromelain, then added 5 billion CFU of complex probiotics. To boost liver function and your immune system, we included nettle leaf and dandelion leaf. Then, kelp powder and dulse powder both made the list to support healthier hair, nails, skin, and bones on top of several other benefits. All told the ingredients we chose and why we chose them could [fill an article](https://ensosuperfoods.com/blogs/supergreens/new-supergreens-formula) all by itself. Long story short, our super greens powder aims to provide maximum value with minimal excess. By using only the most vital ingredients in the amounts your body actually needs, we can limit waste and provide our super greens powder for only $1.33 per serving. Additionally, using only twenty ingredients instead of the hundreds you might find in other products means that you have a decreased risk of food sensitivities from our formula. For anyone who has ever experienced the frustration of reacting to a product without knowing why, this peace of mind is invaluable. |Pros||Cons| | || | Bottom Line: Due to the nature of greens powders, [Ens Supergreens](https://ensosuperfoods.com/products/supergreens) can pack far more nutrients and superfoods into every serving than either KaraMD Pure Nature or Balance of Nature. Additionally, our streamlined formula means no fillers, no unnecessarily high doses of vitamins or minerals, and no problematic additives to trigger food sensitivities or interfere with medications. While some customers may prefer capsules to powder, the ability to add our fresh, minty powder to shakes, water, or food means that your daily supplement feels less like \"medicine\" and more like an opportunity to mix up your daily meals. Karamd Pure Nature vs. Balance of Nature vs. Ens Supergreens Benefits Since KaraMD Pure Nature and [Balance of Nature](https://www.balanceofnature.com/products?details=fruits-veggies) are similar products, it's a good idea to explore how their formulas differ by looking at their health benefits. While [Ens Supergreens](https://ensosuperfoods.com/products/supergreens) is a powder, not a capsule, it still shares many of the same benefits as both products. Supports Nutrition Balance of Nature gives you vitamins and minerals from 15 vegetables and 16 fruits in separate capsules, while Pure Nature uses 20 ingredients in a single capsule. They contain similar ingredients, including kale, celery, and cauliflower. In particular, [kale offers numerous health benefits](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-many-types-and-health-benefits-of-kale), including supporting the immune system, regulating blood pressure, and reducing the risk of certain types of cancer. While they mention which part of the vegetable each ingredient comes from, there is no information about the specific vitamins in either product. With Ens Supergreens, you get full transparency about the vitamins and minerals in each scoop. And, because our greens powder uses kale, broccoli, and other superfoods like kelp and spirulina, we double down on many of the benefits offered by both Balance of Nature and Pure Nature. Boosts Immunity The idea behind Balance of Nature and Pure Nature is that by increasing your daily intake of fruits and vegetables, you can enjoy better health, improve your immune system, and avoid getting sick. In theory, this is true. People who eat nutrient-rich diets have [stronger immune systems](https://ensosuperfoods.com/blogs/supergreens/best-immune-boosting-foods) (given that they don't have any underlying health conditions). While there are healthful ingredients in each blend, the lack of information on them makes it impossible to determine whether they provide sufficient doses of any essential nutrients. Ens Supergreens, however, includes potent ingredients specifically meant to boost your immune system. Among these, moringa leaf and peppermint leaf powders carry some of the most impressive immune-boosting properties, and both have been shown to help eradicate [harmful bacteria and viruses](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13678235/) in the body. Improves Digestion KaraMD suggests it can improve digestive health but doesn't list any prebiotics, probiotics, or digestive enzymes as ingredients. Then the only way it would potentially do this is by increasing your daily fiber intake, but this is not listed on the nutritional label. Balance of Nature doesn't make any specific claims regarding digestion for its Fruits and Veggies capsules, but it states that its Fiber & Spice blend can regulate your bowel movements. Each serving of that formula contains 8 grams of dietary fiber. Conversely, each serving of Ens Supergreens includes 5 billion CFU of complex probiotics, as well as the digestive enzymes papain, bromelain, and vegetarian pepsin to facilitate better digestion. As if this weren't enough, nettle leaf and dandelion leaf both boost liver function and detoxify your body from lingering compounds left over after digestion. Karamd Pure Nature vs. Balance of Nature vs. Ens Supergreens Ingredients In this section, we compared key ingredient usage across the three products to help you in the search for a product that best suits your needs. Organic Superfoods KaraMD Pure Nature uses organic ingredients, but [Balance of Nature](https://www.balanceofnature.com/products?details=fruits-veggies) does not. There are limited superfoods in each, such as kale and broccoli. Still, these cruciferous vegetables do offer health benefits and [contain fiber, vitamins, and phytochemicals](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/10-superfoods-to-boost-a-healthy-diet-2018082914463), such as indoles, thiocyanates, and nitriles, which can prevent certain types of cancer. [Ens Supergreens](https://ensosuperfoods.com/products/supergreens) uses 100% organic ingredients and includes 20+ superfoods designed to keep you running at your best. Probiotics Neither Pure Nature nor Balance of Nature contains probiotics, but Ens Supergreens contains 5 billion CFU of probiotics in every scoop. Digestive Enzymes When it comes to further improving digestive health, neither Pure Nature nor Balance of Nature contain any digestive enzymes or proteins that help your body break down and process food faster and more effectively. Ens Supergreens contains papain from papaya, bromelain from pineapple, and vegetarian pepsin to help supercharge your digestive system. Wide Variety of Superfoods The ingredient list for KaraMD Pure Nature is higher in superfoods than Balance of Nature, which is relatively limited to the type of greens you would find in the produce section of any supermarket. Superfoods like spirulina and chlorella are not included in either formula. Ens Supergreens bases its formula on a potent dose of both spirulina and bioavailable chlorella and also includes other superfoods like ginger, barley grass, and spinach powder to provide a well-rounded nutrient profile. Local Sourcing Without a report stating they source their ingredients locally, it's likely that both Pure Nature and Balance of Nature could be sourced overseas and even be purchased in a powdered or extracted state to be mixed into a blend at their facilities. Ens Supergreens sources its ingredients from expert organic farmers worldwide. Manufactured in the U.S. All three products are made in America. NSF Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Registered Facilities KaraMD makes its products in FDA-registered facilities, but Balance of Nature is not open about the regulations and certifications of any factories they use. Neither product is NSF-Certified for good manufacturing practices. Ens Supergreens uses only GMP-compliant facilities and maintains an excellent relationship with FDA inspectors. Third-party Tested KaraMD claims to be third-party tested, but they do not provide further details about the lab evaluating their products. Balance of Nature does not offer any information about third-party testing on its website. Third-party testing is crucial to Ens's manufacturing process, and we use reputable outside labs to verify each batch of our product is free of any contaminants. Sugar-free Pure Nature, Ens Supergreens, and Balance of Nature are all sugar-free. No Stevia None of these products contains stevia. Caffeine-free Pure Nature and Balance of Nature Fruits and Veggies capsules are caffeine-free. While some greens powders include caffeinated ingredients, Ens Supergreens opts to avoid caffeine in its formula. Non-GMO Balance of Nature, Ens Supergreens, and KaraMD do not use GMOs. Nut-free None of these products contain nuts of any kind. Karamd Pure Nature vs. Balance of Nature vs. Ens Supergreens Taste How easy is it to consume the nutrients in these products? Below, we compared taste and overall experience of all three products. Overall Taste Satisfaction The capsules from Pure Nature and [Balance of Nature](https://www.balanceofnature.com/products?details=fruits-veggies) are tasteless, so you won't have to worry about an earthy taste or artificial flavors in your supplements. However, many greens powders actually taste great and leave you feeling more satisfied than taking a few capsules each day. With [Ens Supergreens](https://ensosuperfoods.com/products/supergreens), we use natural peppermint and monk fruit extract to build our subtly sweet, minty flavor, making it an excellent addition to shakes and other drinks. Texture The larger capsules of KaraMD Pure Nature might be difficult for some to swallow and have a powdery texture. Balance of Nature reports that its Fruit capsules are so good that some people chew on them as a treat. Unlike other greens powders, which may have a gritty or sandy texture, we use a superfine powder to provide the best drinking experience that mixes perfectly with most liquids. Chalky Taste Balance of Nature reports that their Fruit capsules can be chewable, but since they're made with powdered ingredients, there would likely be a chalky texture. KaraMD is not chewable, and Ens Supergreens does not have the chalky taste common among other greens powders. Karamd Pure Nature vs. Balance of Nature vs. Ens Supergreens Cost - [Balance of Nature](https://www.balanceofnature.com/products?details=fruits-veggies)is extremely expensive for its limited nutritional value; a one-time order of their Fruits and Veggies capsules costs $69.95 for 180 capsules in total. This equates to a 30-day supply that costs $2.33 per day. - KaraMD is a more affordable option, with a one-time jar of 120 capsules. That means a 30-day supply would come to $1.33 per day. - [Ens Supergreens](https://ensosuperfoods.com/products/supergreens)matches the $1.33 cost of KaraMD, at $39.99 for each 30-serving package.

Final Thoughts If you're dead set on choosing a capsule-based multivitamin to supplement your daily nutrition, we strongly suggest KaraMD Pure Nature. With more transparent practices and ingredients, a stronger nutrient profile, and better value with each order, the company exceeds Balance of Nature in almost every category.
