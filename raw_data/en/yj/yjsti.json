Learn about the safety, possible health benefits, and side effects of dry fruits for babies.", "sitename": "MomJunction", "date": "2015-01-13", "cleaned_text": "Dry fruits refer to dried fruits and nuts. While the fruits are dried and shrunk after dehydration, the nuts are naturally found inside hard shells. Both are nutrient-rich that can benefit your health. Thus, dry fruits for babies seem a healthy choice to support infant nutrition for proper growth and development. But since some dried fruits and nuts can cause allergic reactions, it is important to know if feeding dry fruits is safe for babies. So, read on as we tell you more about the right age to feed dry fruits to babies, their possible health benefits, side effects, and dry fruit recipes that are worth a try. Are Dried Fruits (Seeds and Nuts) Safe For Babies? Dried fruits can be considered safe for babies. However, you need to be careful while feeding them to a baby due to their potential choking hazard [(1)](https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/foods-and-drinks/choking-hazards.html). Thus, it is good to serve dried fruits in an age-appropriate manner. For babies under one year, you can serve it in cooked, mashed, or pureed forms. Babies older than a year can be served thinly sliced and finely chopped dried fruits. It's worth noting that according to a report by the [New York State Department of Health](https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/injury_prevention/choking_prevention_for_children.htm), choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death in children under the age of five. Food-related incidents also account for the most common cases of nonfatal choking in young children. When To Start Feeding Dried Fruits For Babies? Cooked dried fruits can be introduced to babies once they are six months old [ (2)](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/vegetarian-feeding-guide-for-babies-and-toddlers). It is the age when babies start eating solids and also have a well-developed [gag reflex](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/gagging-in-babies-newborn-causes-prevention_00640779/). But just like any new food, talk to a pediatrician before introducing dry fruits. Potential Health Benefits Of Dried Fruits For Babies Dried fruits are rich in fiber, certain vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and bioactive compounds like polyphenols [ (3)](https://www.ijmrhs.com/medical-research/dry-fruits-and-diabetes-mellitus.pdf). The vast nutritional composition makes dried fruits health-promoting. Below are some health benefits of dried fruits on regular consumption and in moderate amounts. - Nutrient-dense: Dried fruits are energy and nutrient-dense foods that help meet the overall nutritional needs of an infant. A few dried fruits that can boost your baby's nutrient intake are apricots, figs, and dates. - Optimum micronutrient supply: Dried fruits have a good composition of micronutrients. Their regular consumption in moderate amounts could supply essential micronutrients such as vitamins A, B3, E, potassium, magnesium, iron, and folate [(4)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274705564_Dried_fruits_-_brief_characteristics_of_their_nutritional_values_Author's_own_data_for_dietary_fibers_content). These micronutrients ensure support for the development of babies. - Digestive health: Dried fruits are considered rich in dietary fiber that helps in managing digestive health. [Prune juice](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/prune-juice-for-baby-constipation_00372061/#gref)in specific has been used in traditional and modern medicine to treat and manage constipation in infants [(5)](https://www.health.gov.il/English/News_and_Events/Spokespersons_Messages/Pages/02022012_1.aspx) [(6)](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Infant-Constipation.aspx). - Gut microbiota: Dried fruits [such as raisins](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/health-benefits-of-raisins-for-your-baby_0095010/)could support the development of intestinal microflora [(7)](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-019-0439-1#auth-4). This property of raisins is attributed to the presence of fermentable fiber such as inulin and phytochemicals such as phenolic acids and tartaric acid, which acts as prebiotics (food for gut bacteria). Some other dried fruits that hold similar potential are prunes, dates, and figs [(8)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537788/). - Immunity: Strengthening the immune system is vital for infants as they are vulnerable to infections until the age of two years. Dried fruits are rich in micronutrients and bioactive compounds that are known to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties [(9)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24870720). These properties help boost your infant's immunity when dried fruits are consumed regularly. - Anemia: Babies are [vulnerable to anemia](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/anemia-or-iron-deficiency-in-babies_00348827/), especially between nine and 24 months [(10)](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007618.htm). You can supplement your infant's diet with dried fruits, such as raisins, prunes, and apricot, which are good sources of dietary iron. - Bone health: Dried fruits such as prunes or dried plum have shown positive effects on maintaining bone health. The bone protective effects of prunes are attributed to the presence of micronutrients, such as vitamin K, manganese, boron, copper, and potassium [(11)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409740/) [(12)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508855/). Possible Health Risks Of Dried Fruits For Babies There are some health risks of dried fruits that must be kept in mind while you plan to feed them to your baby. - Weight-related health issues: Dried fruits are rich in natural sugars like glucose and fructose. The small size of the fruits can increase the risk of overconsumption. Excess sugar intake, in the long run, is associated with several health concerns such as obesity [(13)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthy-eating/is-eating-dried-fruit-healthy). - Candied fruits: Certain whole fruits, like apple, pineapple, strawberries, and blackcurrant, are also processed to form dried fruits. These fruits are preserved in sugar solution due to which they are also called \"candies.\" Babies should have fewer servings of candied fruits, which are often confused with regular dried fruits [(4)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274705564_Dried_fruits_-_brief_characteristics_of_their_nutritional_values_Author's_own_data_for_dietary_fibers_content). Limit the intake of candied fruit to not more than one to two servings a week. Excess intake could lead to dental issues in infants ( [3](https://www.ijmrhs.com/medical-research/dry-fruits-and-diabetes-mellitus.pdf)). Also, babies might get used to the sweet taste and refuse to eat fresh fruits. - Also, babies might get used to the sweet taste and refuse to eat fresh fruits. - Gastrointestinal disturbances: Dried fruits are rich in dietary fiber. Thus, if consumed in excess, they could lead to gastrointestinal disturbances such as stomach cramps, bloating, gas, constipation, or even diarrhea [(3)](https://www.ijmrhs.com/medical-research/dry-fruits-and-diabetes-mellitus.pdf). - Allergy: Dried fruits are often preserved with the help of sulfites. Sulfites are regulated food additives that are used to preserve the color of certain dried fruits, such as raisins. Sulfites could cause allergic reactions [(14)](https://www.wrha.mb.ca/prog/nutrition/files/allergen_sulphite.pdf). Therefore, check the label while purchasing dried fruits. Purchase dried fruits that are brown or grey in color and are preferably organic. - Toxin contamination: Improperly stored dried fruits can be susceptible to contamination from fungi such as Alternaria, Penicillium, and Aspergillus. These fungi could release mycotoxins, which are harmful and even fatal [(15)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5535147/'). Check the date of packaging on a packet of dry fruit, and also buy them from reliable sellers. [20](https://www.firststepsnutrition.org/s/Dried-Fruit-Snacks-report-for-web.pdf)).

Pistachios are low in fat and contain high amounts of vital nutrients, such as vitamin A, B1, C, K, B6, copper, and magnesium [(18)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/nutrition-attributes-and-health-effects-of-pistachio-nuts/1C2AE1F4EACF37030525FAD73ABCFFA0). You can add finely powdered pistachio to different baby foods. Alternatively, you can add pistachio paste to nut butter and use that butter as a spread on toasted bread and crackers. 2. Which dry fruits should be soaked in water? Generally, almonds, walnuts, and cashew nuts are recommended to be soaked in water to reduce their phytate content, and increase the absorption of nutrients, especially minerals. However, recent studies indicate that soaking doesn't enhance nutrient absorption [(19)](https://www.nutfruit.org/consumers/news/detail/cracking-old-nut-and-dried-fruit-myths). 3. Are dried fruits better for babies than fresh fruits? Dried fruits are high in nutrients and count towards the daily fruit recommendation. However, unlike fresh fruits, they have a higher concentration of calories and sugar.
