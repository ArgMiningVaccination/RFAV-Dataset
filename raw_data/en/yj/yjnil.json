The Acupuncture Examining Board (Board) requires every applicant for licensure to complete the New Jersey Acupuncture Safety and Jurisprudence Examination (\"Examination\") prior to issuance of a license to practice as an acupuncturist in the State of New Jersey. Once an applicant has met the requirements of N.J.A.C. 13:35-9.3, and is approved by the Board, the Board office will inform the applicant that they are eligible to take this Examination. Upon completion of this Examination, and after completing and meeting all licensure requirements, the Board will issue a license to the applicant. The material presented provides an overview of some of the laws and regulations relevant to the practice of acupuncture in New Jersey. The Examination consists of fifty (50) multiple choice questions which focus on acupuncture safety issues such as: contraindications to acupuncture treatment, needling safety, \"Universal Precautions,\" sterilization, and infection control. The remaining questions are related to the laws and regulations governing acupuncture practice in the State of New Jersey. The questions are based on specific statutes and regulations. Statutes, or laws, are designated as N.J.S.A., which stands for \"New Jersey Statutes Annotated.\" Regulations, or rules, are designated as N.J.A.C., which stands for \"New Jersey Administrative Code.\" Regulations supplement the statutes, providing clarification as to statutory requirements or covering topics that are not specifically addressed by statute.

The Board meets its responsibility by licensing professional acupuncturists, adopting regulations, determining standards of practice, investigating allegations of misconduct, and disciplining those who do not adhere to requirements - thereby assuring the public that art therapists are qualified, competent, and truthful. Board Meetings The Board has monthly meetings, which are scheduled up to a year in advance, with the dates posted on its website, Board meetings are held in two parts. One is open to the public, and includes: non-disciplinary sessions (open minutes, policy, legislation, information, public comment), and disciplinary actions (formal hearings). Closed sessions, attended by Board members only, are held when matters need to be discussed privately, such as investigatory matters, potential disciplinary actions, and matters in which the Board needs the advice of legal counsel. Licensure Acupuncture licenses are renewed every two years, on June 30 of odd-numbered years. It is very important that you notify the Board office when you change your mailing address as renewal notifications are not forwarded by the Post Office. The notification will give you information about renewing your license online, paying with a credit card, and other information about keeping your license in good standing. The notification is mailed at least 60 days before your license expires. You may renew for thirty days after your license expires and pay a \"late\" fee of $150. Thirty-one days after your license expires, it will be automatically placed in expired status without further notice to you. If you do not intend to practice in New Jersey during the upcoming licensing period, you may renew your license as \"inactive.\" A Licensed Acupuncturist Must Cooperate with the Committee's Investigative PowersInvestigative powers of the Committee, the Attorney General and the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs include: The following are examples of grounds for discipline of licensees: Licensed acupuncturists are required to report a colleague who demonstrates an impairment or activities of a colleague that pose a clear and imminent danger to public health and welfare (N.J.S.A.45:1-37). Examples of the type of misconduct, which you are required to report, are gross negligence, and actions that pose an imminent danger to the public health safety and welfare. The Complaint and Discipline Process The Board may receive complaints from sources including consumers, other governmental agencies, law enforcement agencies, court officials, and insurance fraud investigators. Each and every one is investigated. The nature of the allegations dictates the type and the depth of the investigation. In most cases, the Board will ask for the licensed acupuncturist's response to the complaint to be considered in the investigation. If you are contacted by the Board and requested to provide information to it, please provide it in a timely manner - your reply and explanation must reach the Board office within 20 days from the date you receive notification or the date specified by the Board. Failure to respond in a timely fashion may result in you being directed to appear before the Board, or sanctioned, for failure to cooperate. When the Board determines that a complaint has merit, the formal discipline process begins. New Jersey's Attorney General prosecutes formal complaints against licensees, and those found to be practicing acupuncture while unlicensed. Acupuncturists have a right to counsel at disciplinary proceedings before the Board. The Board may hear the matter, or refer it to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) who issues an initial decision that is reviewed by the Board. The Board can either adopt, reject or modify the findings of fact and conclusion of law, and the penalties recommended by the ALJ. The final decision is made by the Board. Acupuncturists have the right to appeal a final decision of the Board to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court. Additionally, the Board has the authority to take the interim measure of temporarily suspending a license if there is a palpable demonstration of imminent danger to the public. When a license is revoked or suspended, or clinical practice is barred by another state or licensing authority, and the Board finds that either the continued practice endangers or poses a risk to public health and safety, or gross or repeated negligence, fraud or professional misconduct adversely affecting public health and safety is involved, the Board is authorized to impose a suspension. Possible disciplinary sanctions and other dispositions of formal complaints may include: Under N.J.S.A.45:1-25 licensed professional and associate art therapists may be assessed monetary penalties of up to $10,000, for the first violation and up to $20,000 for the second and subsequent violations.
