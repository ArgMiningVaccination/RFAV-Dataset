ERIN - CLEANSE YOUR LIFE & THE LAW OF PERFECT HEALTH DAILY INSPIRATION: In the days when our indigenous ancestors lived completely in alignment with Mother Nature, they would do spiritual fasts and sauna ceremonies. They understood the wisdom of the body and the plants that grew upon the earth. Medical advancement has allowed us to have longer life spans and new opportunities, but we must still honor the wisdom that comes with cleansing. DAILY UNIVERSAL LAW: Today we align with The Law of Perfect Health. This Universal Law is the axiom that whatever is going on within your health is the mental equivalent of what is going on within consciousness, individually and collectively. When you get out of alignment with Mother Nature and Universal Laws we experience ill-health. Within you is a born intelligence and an innate healer, capable of restoring harmony, well-being and vibrant vitality. When the body is bogged down with toxins and negative emotions it can't function properly. From a spiritual perspective, dis-ease is Spirit (your higher self) communicating that individually and culturally we are out of harmony with life. Symptoms within the body, such as poor health and illness are the relative and inverted experience of our use of Universal Energy. From an absolute perspective, the truth is that you are an eternal immortal spiritual being. You are not your body, you have a body. From a spiritual perspective, the only true disease is amnesia. However, if we choose to experience wellness we must align with nature's way. DAILY SPIRITUAL PRACTICE: Cleanse your mind of all negative thinking. Don't focus on what you don't want. Focus on what you do want to create. DAILY CHALLENGE: Cleanse your life! Clean out your closets. Clean out the junk food in your kitchen. Clean out the friendships that no longer serve. Cleanse your body. Cleanse your thinking. LIVE YOUR TRUTH, DR.
