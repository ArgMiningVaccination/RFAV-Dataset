Done in the evening, it will wash the stress from your body and your aura. You can reclaim yourself, quiet the mind's noise and open into a profound stillness. A little at a time, with regularity and patience, it will add balance to your life.", "sitename": "Sikh Dharma International", "date": "2021-11-06", "cleaned_text": "Originally taught by Yogi Bhajan on January 31, 1996 This exercise brings energy to your immune system to fight infection. It is a very healing exercise. When you feel a tingling in your toes, thighs, and lower back it is an indication that you are doing this exercise correctly. Posture: Sit in Easy Pose with your chin in and your chest out. Breath: Stick your tongue all the way out and keep it out as you rapidly breathe in and out through your mouth. This is called Dog Breath. Time: Continue this panting diaphragmatic breath for 3-5 minutes. To end: Inhale, and hold your breath for 15 seconds and press the tongue against the upper palate. Exhale. Repeat this sequence two more times. \"The problem with you all is you all feel you are wrong and you are not right and you are not doing correct and you are not. It is called underestimating your grace. This is a common disease with all of us. Common disease that we undermine ourselves. When we undermine ourselves, we can't relax. When we can't relax, there is a tension. When there is a tension, there is sickness.\" ~Yogi Bhajan This kriya is published "}
