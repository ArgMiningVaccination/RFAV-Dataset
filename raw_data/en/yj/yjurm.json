In this initial appointment, the naturopathic doctor will go through a thorough assessment of your all health concerns that you wish to address and your health goals through a comprehensive patient history intake, including a health assessment of the your diet, environment, toxic load, stress, and other aspects of your lifestyle that may be effecting your current health situation. A standard CBC (complete blood count) and urine (random) test is included in the first apointment at no additional cost. The doctor may suggest additional testing that is required to obtain a complete health picture and to assess the root cause of your health problem or concern. This would be at an additional cost. At the end of this visit, our naturopathic doctor may also provide you with some dietary and lifestyle suggestions or supplements to address your health concerns. The primary goal at our naturopathic clinic is your OPTIMAL HEALTH and WELL BEING, as well as focusing on disease prevention and symptom resolution to help you achieve your health goals, and with that in mind, we will work together to find the best natural path to get your there. We do offer pediatric naturopathic visits as well and do see patients starting at just 4 days old. In the initial pediatric naturopathic appointment, the naturopathic doctor will go through a thorough assessment of the health concerns that you wish to address for your child, along with the health goals through a comprehensive patient history intake, including a health assessment of their diet, environment, toxic load, stress, and other aspects of their lifestyle that may be effecting their current health situation. This will be followed by a complaint oriented physical exam. Our naturopath may recommend laboratory testing if need be. She may also suggest some naturopathic treatments for your child. Following this initial pediatric consult, a follow up appointment will be recomended in a reasonable time frame depending on the health concerns. Your second naturopathic visit will include a complete physical exam and other standard diagnostic procedures to evaluate your physical health in general. This appointment will also include a Traditional Chinese Medicine Tongue and Pulse Diagnosis and Body Fat Analysis. (Our naturopath will discuss any additional testing you may require based on your physical health assessment). Following this appointment, you will be given a comprehensive treatment plan on your treatment plan visit, based on all the information and the testing, once the physical exam appointment is completed. The treatment plan will provide health suggestions to address your health concerns, as well, optimize your health and wellbeing. A follow up will be most likely be suggested within a month or two after the treatment plan visit. Diagnosis of the disease is only part of the process; once a good understanding of the patient's health and disease status is established, the naturopathic doctor and the patient work together to establish a treatment and health-promoting program.
