Do you wonder about your future? Do you wish you were happier? If so, let's talk. Hi, I'm Stephanie Bagby-Stone and I have time in my schedule to meet with all medical students interested in improving their well-being. From my past experiences, I am aware that medical students need someone that will help them create balance and conditions which promote success, identify their strengths and values, and nurture their talents and creativity. I'm so excited to be able to talk to you about these things. My approach is greatly influenced by the Science of Happiness (Positive Psychology) which seeks to create thriving, meaningful lives. The science is clear\u2014happiness and well-being have positive effects on the body and on performance. As a graduate of the MU school of medicine, I've experienced PBL first hand. I spent many years as the chief psychiatrist at the MU Student Health Center providing care for undergraduate, graduate and professional students experiencing stress, burn-out and medical conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar and ADHD. I am very familiar with campus and community resource. In addition to providing coaching, I can help you by providing referrals for diagnoses needing treatment, medication management, psychological testing or psychotherapy. Why schedule time to talk with me? - If you are experiencing distress and are in need of support or guidance. - If you want to learn ways to optimize your happiness and your success. - If you have ideas for needed wellness programs. - If you are simply curious. If any of these reasons resonate with you, email me to find a time. I am looking forward to talking with you! Faculty Liaison - Student Coaching Adjunct Associate Professor of Clinical Psychiatry HSE 100E Adjusting to Medical School Medical school requires long hours, dedication and changes in routine and study habits. First year students adapt to a curriculum unlike any ever experienced. Many students are used to performing at the top of their class. Grading in the curriculum the first year is Pass/Fail (second year grading Honors/Pass/Fail) which yield student scores closer to an \"average\" range. This may be an adjustment for some. Due to the rigorous demands of medical school often students forgo self-care to focus on academics. While this seems to be a logical decision literature suggests that tanking study breaks yields more productivity. Additionally diet can also have an impact. While life activities can take away time from academics, they are an important aspect of balancing wellness and education. Mizzou Med values student health and wellness and works to provide activities that promote overall well being of our students. Each class elects wellness representatives who serve on a committee in collaboration with the medical education office and faculty liaison to organize programs and activities promoting overall wellness and life balance. Wellness at Mizzou Med Student wellness is important to all of us at the MU school of medicine. Wellness activities and programs have been advancing over recent years and we are continuing to grow! - Our students are actively involved in creating our wellness programs and activities. Two wellness representatives are elected from each medical school class and are involved in the planning of wellness programming and activities. - Dr. Stephanie Bagby-Stone, our Faculty Liaison for Student Coaching, is available to meet with students for wellness coaching and to connect students with resources. She also meets individually with every M1 and M2 student for a wellness check-in. - We offer multiple wellness events in recognition of Show Me Compassionate Medical Education Day. The Missouri legislature passed Senate Bill 52 recognizing this day with the intention to bring awareness to medical student well-being, mental health, stress management, and student treatment. These activities have focused on helping students to connect and to raise awareness of mental health risks and resources. - Health and Wellness Block Talks are offered each block, at noon with lunch provided, with topics including medical student mental health, campus resources, fitness, nutrition, stress management and mindfulness. Other topics for discussion include burnout, coping with failure and resilience. - Other wellness activities have included health and wellness newsletters, volunteering opportunities, food fairs, and various sport/fitness related activities. - We strive to make wellness and stress management easily accessible to our medical students by providing art supplies, exercise bikes and sports equipment in the student labs. - Since 2015, all of the allopathic and osteopathic medical schools in Missouri have convened annually with a focused agenda of discussions regarding improving student mental health and wellness.
