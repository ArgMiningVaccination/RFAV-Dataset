Defendant FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SOU GHT AND JURY TRIAL DEMANDED Plaintiff Dr. Yvoune Kara Petrie, DC (\"Plaintiff\"), by her undersigned attorney, alleges as follows, upon actual knowledge with respect to herself and her own acts, and upon Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 1 of 49 PageID# 151 2 information and belief as to all other matters: NATU RE OF THE ACTION 1. Virginia chiropractors threaten the profits and lifestyle of Virginia medical doctors. From the medical doctor's perspective, chiropractors are invading their \"turf\" by treating patients' conditions and the underlying causes of their cond itions both less expensively and often more effectively. Moreover, throughout the country, chiropractors are often replacing medical doctors for patients' point of primary care. With growing calls for better patient care at lower costs, this competitive threat is a serious problem for medical doctors. Indeed, health care and its skyrocketing costs invade policy debates year -after-year. 2. The competitive threat to medical doctors from Virginia chiropractors, however, is representative of a much broader move ment that challenges our current healthcare structure of treating symptoms of disease and other problems instead of creating overall wellness through holistic and functional approaches that focus on the underlying processes (including diet and lifestyle) t hat create disease and other problems. These \"alternative\" approaches to healthcare have the potential to both revolutionize peoples' lives and save a lot of money (without resorting to a government -run health -plan). Chiropractors, including Virginia chi ropractors, are on the cutting -edge of these innovative approaches. However , like any industry threatened with \"disruptive\" models or technology, medical doctors have a strong incentive to take whatever actions are necessary to slow this new approach, how ever beneficial. And that is exactly what the Virginia Board of Medicine and its majority -controlled medical doctors have done. 3. Competition among service -providers is good for the customer because the suppliers must lower prices or improve their service to persuade consumers to select them over Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 2 of 49 PageID# 152 3 the supplier's competitor. Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court has explained that \"[t]he heart of our national economy has long been faith in the value of competition.\"1 4. Sometimes an entrenched class of providers will begin to face competition from different types of providers that compete through new or different services, better prices, more effective delivery of services, or an alternative approach. When this happens \u2014and it happens a lot\u2014it is uncomfortable. The en trenched providers may see their profits shrink, their customers might come around less, and their current operations \u2014which may have stayed the same for years or decades \u2014are no longer adequate. 5. The entrenched providers can take one of two paths when facing a new competitive threat. The first path is to compete better: the service -provider might reduce prices, improve services, or sometimes even change their entire approach to better keep and attract customers. Complacency is the enemy of this path. This first path represents the foundation of our economic system and collectively improves our lives every day. 6. The second path focuses on the competitor instead of competition: the service - provider attacks the new competitor s and finds some way to keep them f rom effectively competing for customers. From the psychological perspective of the entrenched provider, it is understandable. They are us ed to a way of life and do not want to change. Moreover, after years of following and living an approach, it is not uncommon that these entrenched providers \u2014 themselves feeling threatened \u2014might refle xively attack their competitors rather than looking in the mirror and improving their own business. 7. This second path is well traveled and is one of the reasons we have the fe deral antitrust laws, which embody \"fundamental national values of free enterprise and economic 1 National Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. United States , 435 695 (1978). Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 3 of 49 PageID# 153 4 competition.\"2 The entrenched provider that eliminat es its competitor from its market harms competition, and therefore consumers. The federal antitrust laws p rotect competition by creating a cause of action for competitors that are harmed through anticompetitive conduct \u2014often exercised on this second path. 8. The Plaintiff seeks antitrust relief because the medical doctors on the Virginia Board of Medicine (the \"B oard\" or \"Defendant\" ) joined together to keep Plaintiff, a Virginia Chiropractor and primary care provider , from competing against medical doctors in areas where their respective customers overlap. Recognizing the increasing competitive threat of chiropra ctors in Virginia and elsewhere to medical doctors, these me dical doctors travelled down the second path \u2014by exercising their m arket power to keep medical -doctor competitors , like chiropractors , from invading their \"turf.\" 9. This is a case by a solitary chiro practor against a powerful board and some of the medical doctors that domina te it. She stands alone on the caption, but brings this case \u2014not only to vindicate her own rights and compe titive injuries \u2014but to stand up for the many other chiropractors and othe r holistic and alternative -health providers that are constantly bullied by state medical boards and doctors . She brings this case for her patients and the patients of those like her \u2014health providers that see a better way of helping people live healthy than the tired method of healthcare monopolized by medical doctors. She brings this case so she and others like her have the opportunity to compete to improve and save lives. THE PARTIES 10. Plaintiff is a citizen of the United States and a resident of Fairfax Cou nty in the Commonwealth of Virginia w here, until earlier this year, she used to practice chiropractic, 2 Federal Trade Comm'n v.

Defendant , Virginia Medical Board (the \"Board\" or \"Defendant\" ), is a quasi - public and quasi -private agency established under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, charge d with regulating the practice of Medicine, Podiatry, Osteopathy and Chiropractic among other branches of the healing arts in Virginia . It has its official address at 9960 Mayland Drive, Suite 300 , Henrico, V irginia 23233. 12. Defendant, J.

Defendants Clements, Dave, Dunnavant, Harp, Piness, and Reynolds shall be referred to collectively (in both their individual competitor and official capacity as Virginia Medical Board members) as the \"Individual Defendants.\" 19. The Individual Defendants are named in their individual capacity because each of them are actual and potential competitors with each other and actual and potential competitors with Plainti ff. Thus, each of them and Plaintiff have a horizontal relationship. This horizontal relationship is separate and apart from Individual Defendants' role as members of the Virginia Board of Medicine. The Individual Defendants and the Board will be referr ed to collectively as \"Defendants.\" 4 Doctors of osteopathy, although sometimes referred to separately, are also, for purposes of this Amended Complaint, included within the definition of medical doctors.

The Board is subject to personal jurisdiction in Virginia because its official address is in Virginia, and because it conducts its business in Virginia. All individuals are subject to personal jurisdiction in Virginia because they reside in Virginia, work in Virginia, and serve the Virginia Medical Board in Virginia. SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS I. BACKGROUND 24. The concept of chiropractic as a healing art emerged with the first chiropractic adjustment in the late 1890's . The passage of the first chiropractic licensing bill (by both houses of the Minnesota legislature) in 1905 established chiropractic as a credible modality for treating human ailments and conditions . Ever since then the medical profession has mounted a consistent campaign to discredit the practice of chiropractic as mere quackery while strategically branding practitioners of that branch of the healing arts as engaged in the unlawful practice of medicine without a license. Prosecution of many chiropracto rs was instigated by state medical boards and Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 7 of 49 PageID# 157 8 their participant medical doctors \"determined to crush all challengers to their authority,\" and many chiropractors were convicted and jailed and/o r fined due to the actions of these medical boards and the contr olling medical doctors .5 Practitioners of Osteopathy , who later banded with the medical profession , also mounted various attacks on the chiropractic profession as a bastardized form of osteopathy and sought to distance themselves by seeking a separate licensure.6 25. This organized and extensive campaign to discredit the practice of chiropractic over a 60 -year period escalated to a head when , in 1963, the American Medical Association (\"AMA \") established a \"Committee on Quackery\" with the mandate of containing and eventually eliminating the chiropractic profession . The AMA in various official publications described the chiropractic profession as an \"unscientific cult\" and decreed that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate themselves with a group of \"unscientific practitioners\" (read chiropractors).7 The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) also formed in 1963. 26. In 1987 in the landmark case of Chester Wilk v. American Medical Association , 671 F.Supp. 1465 (N.D. Ill. 1987),8 the AMA was found to have violated Section 1 of the 5 At one point, an estimated 15,000 lawsuits were filed a gainst chiropractors in the early part of the 20th century. See Chiropractic History: a Primer , by Joseph C. Keating, Jr., Ph.D., et al, published by the Association for the History of Chiropractic, available at http://www.historyofchiropractic.org/books. 6 In the early development of both modalities there seemed to be some consensus that the human body was similar to a \"machine\" wh ere various parts and organs could be skillfully maneuvered through spinal manipulation and the regulation of joint dysfunctio n to institute a drugless cure and bring relief to a patient. While osteopathy identified this process as \"somatic dysfunction\" affecting the circulatory system, chiropractic described the manipulative process as \"subluxation ,\" a way of regulating the hum an nervous system. 7 Chiropractic History: a Primer , supra , at pp. 32 -35. 8 Also see the subsequent appeal at 895 F. 2d 352 (7th Cir. 1990). Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 8 of 49 PageID# 158 9 Sherman Act by engaging in an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade in its attempt to eliminate the chiropractic profession through its national boycott strategies.9 27. The medical p rofession continues to hold their chiropractic counterparts as inferiors despite this decision and the emergence in the 1980s of a chiropractic renaissance establishing the chiropractic profession as a scientifically -backed modality for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions through spinal manipu lations and other non -invasive procedures . 28. The standards and scope of chiropractic through accredited chiropractic colleges have grown far beyond that of spinal manipulation. Chiropractic emerged in the 21st century as an even greater competitive threat to the medical profession \u2014that of a primary -care provider . Chiropractors now graduate with the requisite accredited education and training to practice as primary -care providers. The medical profession , however, has aggressively fought expansions of chiropractors and others onto their \"turf.\" The AMA broadcasts this by posting articles on its web site summarizing current litigations against chiropractors relating to scope of practice issues.10 29. Doctors of Chiropractic are not only trained primary care providers, but most chiropractic doctors have also been practicing complementary and alternative medicine (CAM ) since the inception of chiropractic. According to the National Center of Alternative and Compl ementary Medicine (NCCAM) , nearly 40% of Americans \"u se health care approaches 9 The steps outlined by the AMA committee on quackery designed to contain and ultimately eliminate chiropractic included a) ensuring that Medicare did not cover chiropractic, b) ensuring that the US Office of Education did not recognize a chiropractic accrediting agency, c) encouraging the continued separation of then existing two national associations (the ACA and the UCA) and d) encouraging state medical societies to take initiatives at the state legislative level regarding the promulgation of laws that would negatively impact the chiropractic profession. 10 http://www.ama -assn.org//ama/pub/physician -resources/lega Filed 02/03/14 Page 9 of 49 PageID# 159 10 developed outside of mainstream Western, or conventional, medicine for specific conditions or overall well -being.\"11 30. CAM practitioners focus on treating the \"whole person\" and incorporate a variety of modalities such as dietary m odification, nutrition, supplements (containing botanicals, vitamins, minerals , etc.), meditation, acupuncture, massage, yoga, homeopathy and Chinese medicine. Chiropractors have stood on the forefront and continue to lead a growing body of CAM practition ers.12 They are unique in that most of them have decades of experience as CAM practitioners and can incorporate this into their primary care practice.13 Thus chiropractors pose one of the greatest competitive threats to the long -standing and entrenched me dical profession as a near ly \"one -stop-shop\" for patients (only necessitating referral of a patient to the medical profession for needed specialty care, medication management and/or surgery). 31. The medical profession continues to seek limit s on the scope of practice for chiropractors (as well as other CAM and non -medical health practi tioners). The AMA's activities have unfortunately harmed patients by worsening much needed access to care in current times of a nation -wide primary care provider shortage.14 The following are e xamples of the AMA's activ ities to limit competition with medical doctors : (a) In 2003 , the AMA formally created the Scope of Practice Partnership when the AMA House of Delegates' adopted Resolution 814.15 The AMA's stated goal was to 11 http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam 12 Examples of other CAM practitioners include acupuncturists, midwives, doctors of naturopath y, and homeopaths. 13 Across the United States there are four types of stand -alone primary care providers - doctors of chiropractic, medicine, naturopathy and osteopathy. Doctors of Naturopathy are licensed in 17 states and the District of Columbia. 14 See Chiropractic Scope of Practice Update https://www.acatoday.org/content_css.cfm?CID=5307 October 2013. 15 The SOPP was formed by a group of 10 medical executives representing five states and five Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 10 of 49 PageID# 160 11 study the qualifications, education, academic requirements, licensure, certification, independent governance, ethical standards, disciplinary processes , and peer review of non -medical health practitioners, so that the AMA can affect each non -medical practitione r's scope of practice. (b) The AMA's April 20 07 policy H -270.958 \"Need for Active Medical Board Oversight of Medical Scope -of-Practice Activities by Mid Level Practitioners \"16 sought to place doctors of medicine and/or osteopathy on state medical boar ds to be assertive in limiting the scope of non -medical practitioners that encroach on th e practice of medical and osteopathic doctors. (c) The AMA's year 2000 directive D -35.999 \" 'Non Physicians' Expanded Scope of Practice (Laboratory Tes ting and Test Interpretation) \" seeks to \"ensure that diagnostic laboratory testing should only be performed by those individuals who possess appropriate clinical education and training, under the supervision of licensed physicians (MD/DO); and... limit labor atory test ordering and interpretation of test results solely to licensed physicians (MD/DO) and licensed dentists.\"17 32. The Virginia Medical Board and the Individual Defendants are in the perfect position to limit the scope of chiropractors because there is no separate chiropractic board in Virginia .18 The Medical Board, made up primarily of Virginia medical doctors and other competitors to chiropractors , controls the extent of competition between medical doctors and chiropractors by regulating both professio ns. medical specialty societies concerned about sc ope expansion by non -medical health practitioners. -35.999.HTM 18 The Commonwealth of Virginia is one of only 3 or so states in the country without a separate Chiropractic Board. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 11 of 49 PageID# 161 12 33. Doctors of Osteopathy and Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) 19, like medical doctors, also compete with chiropractors and have similar financial incentives to limit the scope of chiropractic. The practice of medicine , podiatry and osteopathy relies on the treatment of symptoms (i.e. if a patient has high blood sugar they are put on a medication to lower it). The practice of chiropractic relies on the determining the cause of a symptom and treating the cause (i.e. if a patient has high blood sugar a ch iropractor will determine why the blood sugar is high and treat the cause. To elaborate a patient may have high blood sugar because an area of the brain involved in regulating response to stress has inappropriate activity , which a doctor of chiropractic c an help normalize and blood sugar goes down). A podiatrist would also treat a diabetic (from the symptomatic perspective) and commonly are the first doctor to diagnosis a diabetic due to complications this disease can cause in the lower extremities. Thus, doctors of chiropractic compete directly with medical doctors, podiatrists and doctors of osteopathy for patients with the same symptoms. This also creates an important distinction when there is overlap in scope, such as treating a diabetic. It is the me thod of treatment (treating symptom compared to cause) that differentiates doctors of chiropractic from medical doctors, podiatrists and doctors of osteopathy. 34. The financial incentives that individual defendants have to limit the scope of chiropractic also make them biased to have control and power over the overlap of chiropractic and medical doctors of osteopathy. That is, individual defendants have an economic conflict of interest in making determinations that affect the extent of competition between thei r own field (medicine and osteopathy) and an overlapping or adjacent field like chiropractic. 19 Doctors of Podiatric Medicine h ave the same training as an MD and DO, with a specialty in disorders of the lower extremity. DPMs are trained and fully licensed to independently perform full -body history and physical examinations in any setting for any patient. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 12 of 49 PageID# 162 13 II. THE VIRGINIA BOARD O F MEDICINE AND INDIVIDUAL DEFEN DANTS LIMIT THE SCOPE OF P LAINTIFF'S PRACT ICE 35. Plaintiff, a Doctor of Chiropractic, is licensed to practice chi ropractic in the Commonwealth of Virginia with effect from July 12, 2006 . Before the suspension of her license (#0104 -556481) , Plaintiff's license was continuously active since the date it became effective . Plaintiff is also admitted to practice chiropra ctic in the state of California effective from 2003 , and is licensed (inactive) as a chiropractor in New South Wales, Australia . She is also a fellow of the International Pediatric Chiropractic Association . 36. Plaintiff practices as a primary care provider , more specifically employing a form of chiropractic that incorporates CAM, functional neurology and functional medicine20 under the name \"Virginia Functional Medicine, Inc.,\" in Vienna, Virginia, in Fairfax County . She advertises her practice through variou s media in particular fields of the healing arts both as a chiropractic primary care provider as well as in chiropractic functional medicine and neurology . Plaintiff's practice includes addressing the underlying causes of neuropathy, autoimmune conditions , Type II diabetes , thyroid , and other health conditions in her patients. 37. By letter dated February 2, 2012 , the Department of Health Professions issued to Plaintiff a notice informing her that an Informal Conference had been scheduled for March 22, 2012 , at which a special committee of the Board and individual defendants would inquire into purported allegations that Plaintiff may have violated certain laws and regulations governing the practice of chiropractic within the Commonwealth. 20 Functional Medicine in volves the promotion of \"wellness on the fundamental underlying factors that influenced every patient's experience of health and disease .\" Functional Medicine \"helps clinicians identify and ameliorate dysfunctions in the physiology and biochemistry of the human body as a primary method of improving patient health.\" This preventative approach of addressing the underlying causes of diseases is the epitome of the licensed practice of chiropractic. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 13 of 49 PageID# 163 14 38. At the May 3, 2012 Informal Hearing (the \"Informal Hearing\"), the Board issued Plaintiff a reprimand , imposed a $2,500 fine, and required that she provide Defendant with a written statement verifying compliance with the laws regulating the practice of medicine and the other hea ling arts ( Chapter 29 of Title 54.1 of the Virginia Code) and the Regulations governing the practice of Medicine, Osteopathy, Podiatry and Chiropractic (under Health Regulations 18 VAC 85-20-10, et seq .) 39. The Board also ordered Plaintiff to stop using a ben ign laser device in her practice . Plaintiff \u2014despite her contention that use of this device is within the scope of chiropractic in Virginia , and that no Virginia law or regulation justified the Defendant's ruling \u2014 ceased using the laser device in her practi ce on counsel's advice the day after the Board's Informal Hearing in May 2012 , and promptly discontinued related advertising. 40. In accordance with Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-4020.A, Plaintiff requested a formal administrative hearing before the Defendant Board, at which point the Order from the Informal Hearing was vacated. 41. After the February 22, 2013 formal hearing (\"Formal Hearing\") before a panel comprised predominantly of medical doctors (including Individual Defendants) and not a single chiropractic doctor , the Board and Individual Defendants issued a February 28, 2013 order suspending Plaintiff's chiropractic license for a 6 -month period and impos ing a monetary penalty of $25,000.00 on Plaintiff , among other punitive measures. 42. Plaintiff duly gave notice of her int ention to appeal the Order handed down by the Board within the 30 -day period allowed under the rules and thereafter lodged a petition through her counsel for Judicial Review with the Circuit Court at Fairfax County on May 30, 2013. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 14 of 49 PageID# 164 15 43. Plaintiff requested that the Board stay enforcement of its February 28, 2013 Order , pending the outcome of the appeal , but the Board denied that request. Thus, regardless of the outcome of the appeal, Plaintiff has already suffered harm from Defendants' conduct, including the los s of her license and other actions by the Board and Individual Defendants. 44. By the terms of the February 28, 2013 Order, Plaintiff's license may only be reinstated subject to the conditions, among others, that: a) Plaintiff ceases from advertising that completion of post -doctoral training or continuing professional educational training or her provision of training or continuing education to others provides her with expertise in any subject unless such training or continuing education is received from or pro vided by the Council on Chiropractic Education ( \"CCE \"), b) Plaintiff should limit her practice of chirop ractic, which the Board arbitrarily concluded \"does not include the diagnosis, management, or treatment of thyroid disease, diabetes, metabolic disease, or interpreting medical tests or examinations\", and c) that furthermore, Plaintiff's practice shall not include or imply that her services includes \"...the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human physical or mental ailments, conditions, diseases, pain or infirmities by any means or method. \" Thus, by the terms of the Board's order, Plaintiff, a chiropractor, if she wants her license restored in the future may not even treat \"pain\" by any means or methods. 45. The Order of the Defendant Board of February 28, 2013 also held that Plaintiff \"shall not claim to prevent, diagnose, or treat the traditional ailments, conditions and diseases of medicine or surgery, obstetrics, or osteopathy in any of her promotional materials, in paper form, electronic form, or other , and Dr. Petrie shall not administer or prescribe any drugs, medicines, serums or vaccines\" [ read shall not prescribe vitamins or dietary supplements ].21 21 The Board and Individual Defendants accused Plaintiff of p racticing as a Nutritionist and/or Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 15 of 49 PageID# 165 16 A. The Composition of the Board. 46. The Commonwealth of Virginia is one of very few states without a separat e Chiropractic Board to regulate the practice of chiropractic within the state.22 All actionable disciplinary complaints involving chiropractors are managed by the Virginia Board of Medicine. 47. At the Informal Hearing of Plaintiff's case before the Board, on ly a single chiropractor (the only chiropractic member on the Virginia Board of Medicine) participated . Worse , during the Formal Hearing of Plaintiff's case, there was not a single chiropractor on the panel . The lone chiropractor on the Defendant Board, Dr. Valerie Lowe Hoffman, DC, was eliminated as \"tainted\" following her participation on the preliminary panel during the Informal Hearing. 48. The panel in question was made up of Dr. Irina Farqhuar (citizen member), Dr. Siobahn Dunnavant, MD, Dr. Wayne Reyno lds, DO, Dr. William Harp, MD, Stephen Heretick, JD (Chairperson), Dr. Jane Pinness, MD, Dr. Kamlesh Dave, MD, Dr. Randolph Clements, DPM and Jane Maddux (citizen member), all of whom ruled against the Plaintiff with the exception of one citizen member, Dr. Farqhuar. These individuals, with the exception of Dr. Farqhuar and Jane Maddux (citizen members) , are co -conspirators with the Board (in their individual capacity as competitors) in an agreement to harm competition and Plaintiff , as described throughou t this Amended Complaint. Medical doctors and doctors of osteopathy have Dietitian without the requisite training or license. Since there was no allegation that Plaintiff ever prescribed any drugs, serums, medications or vaccines to her patients and none was established at the hearing, this re striction can only imply that her prescription of vitamins and supplements were beyond the scope of her training. 22 As far back as October 13, 1999, the Department of Health Professions recommended the creation of an independent Board of Chiropractic to r egulate chiropractors in Virginia . See \"Study of the Merit of an Independent Board of Chiropractic\", Senate Document No.5 of that year pursuant to the Senate Joint Resolution SJR433 (1999) Virginia. The voting on both the floor of the Senate and the House were virtually unanimous on the creation of a separate Chiropractic Board, but as of the filing of this Complaint nothing more has been heard regarding this project. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 16 of 49 PageID# 166 17 financial incentives to limit the scope of practice of competitors like chiropractors, so they have conflicts of interest and bias in making determinations that require decisions abo ut the scope of competition among chiropractors, medical doctors, and doctors of osteopathy. 49. The Commonwealth of Virginia has not evinced an intention in any way to exclude competition in the provision of healthcare within the state in favor of a particula r branch of the healing profession. 50. The Commonwealth has also not evinced an y intent to allow competing medical doctor s, podiatrist s or osteopath s to determine the scope of practice for chiropractic arts, particularly in an area of competition between thes e professionals and chiropractors. B. Vitamins and Supplements . 51. The Board stated that Plaintiff engaged in unprofessional conduct because she prescri bed23 vitamins and dietary supplements and counsel ed clients on lifestyle modifications to support the health -related concerns of her patients and to address the underlying causes of Type II diabetes. 52. To obtain licensure in the Commonwealth of Virginia, a doctor of chiropractic must graduate from a CCE accredited school and pass the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (\"NBCE \") parts I -IV examinations . Such an aspirant must demonstrate proficiency in areas like nutrition, patient diagnosis, lab testing, urine testing, differential diagnosis and appropriate referrals.24 23 Plaintiff prescribed vitamins and supplements to her patients as a written direction fo r a therapeutic or corrective agent. These were not prescriptions filled by pharmacies in the way that they fill medical prescriptions. There are, however, many supplements that are only sold to health care practitioners, like chiropractors, with a valid license, who in turn can, in appropriate instances, provide them to their patients. 24 See National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) Written Examinations -Parts I, II and III and Physiotherapy Booklet, Spring 2013. Also see NBCE Examinee Information for the Part IV National Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 17 of 49 PageID# 167 18 53. Plaintiff's qualifications as a Doctor of Chiropractic with extensive postgraduate training in Functional Endocrinology, Functional Blood Chemistry, Autoimmunity, Functional Immunology, Functional Neurology, Diet, Nutrition and Neurochemistry make her eminently qualified to provide a program of ca re, including nutritional supplementation, lifestyle changes and dietary counseling to her patients . This program of care developed for each individual patient, relies on standardized testing through primarily Medicare approved laboratories (both within t he Commonwealth of Virginia and in other states) and incorporates blood, saliva, urine, stool, oral , nasal and other laboratory testing. 54. Plaintiff is also expressly permitted under the Health Regulations 18 VAC 85- 20-40.C to recommend and direct patients on the use of diet , food supplements , vitamins and minerals in accordance with the standards of her branch of the healing arts . These standards require use of laboratory testing for each patient's care based on their health history , symptoms and probable c ause(s) of their health conditions . Plaintiff helped to develop and t each this standard of care through CCE accredited schools to fellow chiropractors as well as other healthcare practitioners. 55. Plaintiff's assertion at the Board hearing that the effects o f Type II diabetes can and ha ve been reversed through making appropriate lifestyle changes and through the systematic administration and use of food supplements and vitamins are clearly supported and endorsed in peer-reviewed articles and scientific public ations by eminent physicians and other health practitioners , as well as by several of Plaintiff's patients over the years . Indeed, just as the medical profession has grown and evolved over the years, so too has the Chiropractic profession. Many Doctors of Chiropractic throughout the country, including plaintiff, employ research -based Practical Examination, February 2013 and the Council of Chiropractic Examiners (CCE) Accreditation Standards, Principles, Processes & Requirements for Accreditation, January 2013. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 18 of 49 PageID# 168 19 standards from peer -reviewed journals to dictate practice. This approach is currently taught in CCE accredited colleges and continuing education courses. 56. Addressing the cause (s) of diabetes and the subsequent lowering of blood sugar levels normalizes the transmission of nerve energy, which is a hallmark of chiropractic treatment ;25 a traditional chiropractic adjustment is just one of several method s of normalizing the transmiss ion of nerve energy.26 57. Even though Plaintiff never described herself as a \"nutritionist\" or \"dietician\" as required under the applicable statute to constitute a violation, Plaintiff by the quality, extent and scope of her training has garnered requisite exp ertise and qualifications far in excess of that required to practice as a dietitian or nutritionist in Virginia. 58. The Board 's ruling to the effect that Plaintiff may not practice diet and/ or nutrition is not borne out as state policy or clearly articulated by the state legislature , and is contrary to Virginia law as set forth in Virginia Code \u00a7 54.1 -2730 . 59. The state is not actively engaged in the supervision of this power grab by the medical profession (including Individual Defendants) in the Commonwealth , which has the deleterious and singular objec tive of eliminating well over 1500 Virginia chiropractors as 25 Under Va. Code \u00a7 54.1-2900, the: \" 'practice of chiropractic' means the adjustment of the 24 movable vertebrae of the spinal column, and assisting nature for the purpose of normalizing the transmission of nerve energy , but does not include the use of surgery, obstetrics, osteopathy or the administratio n or prescribing of any drugs, medicines, serums or vaccines.\" (Emphasis supplied). 26 The evolving standard of chiropractic care has far exceeded the mere adjustment of the spine, which is only one way of normalizing the transmission of nerve energy in pa tients. Regulating blood sugar (the elevation of which is a well -established cause of neuropathy) normalizes the transmission of nerve energy. Addressing the underlying cause of thyroid dysfunction will do the same, because nerves and brain tissue requir e appropriate thyroid hormone exposure to function properly. Reducing fat deposits around the waist area is a well -accepted treatment for low back pain and affects posture and nerve energy by affecting proprioceptive input from the spine into the brain. With the ever -changing landscape of the healthcare system, the current practice of chiropractic involves a very complex system of diagnostics, including labs and exams to normalize the transmission of nerve energy. Diet, exercise, nutrition, food suppleme nts, vitamins and their specific uses are just some examples of aids to assist patients in normalizing nerve energy. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 19 of 49 PageID# 169 20 competition for medical and osteopathic physicians (and particularly as primary -care providers) in this particular area of health practice. C. Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Diseases and Interpreting Medical Exams . 60. Doctors of Chiropractic , as other Primary Care Provi ders (\"PCPs\") recognized by most health insurance companies within the healing profession , must order and interpret medical tests, diagno se all conditions of the human body and perform necessary examinations to effectively practice their profession. Absent these abilities and practices, Doctors of Chiropractic cannot effectively compete with medical doctors for patients. 61. The Chiropractic C ouncil on Education mandates the performance of case - appropriate physical examinations by chiropractors that involve the evaluation of body regions and organ systems, including the spine and any subluxation/neuro -biomechanical dysfunction that would assist a chiropractic clinician in developing a proper diagnosis. 62. A chiropractor's training therefore involves conducting diagnostic studies and consultations including imaging, clinical laboratory and specialized testing procedures to collate objective clinical data; formulating diagnosis garnered from a patient's medical history, examination and diagnostic studies; generating problem lists with diagnoses after synthesizing and correlating data from patient history, physical exams, diagnostic tests and other nec essary follow -up consultations including making appropriate referral of patients to specialists . Plaintiff states that this is the essence of practice as a PCP and/or chiropractic primary care provider (\"CPCP\"). 63. Consequently, prohibiting a chiropractor fr om interpreting medical tests or performing an examination effectively eliminates chiropractors from practicing in the Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 20 of 49 PageID# 170 21 Commonwealth of Virginia , and therefore eliminates a competitor for medical doctors in the primary care provider market , and the other al leged relevant markets. 64. Even for the traditional practice of chiropractic, a chiropractor cannot adjust the vertebrae without a proper examination , case -appropriate laboratory testing, and/or imaging studies to determine which vertebrae do and do not requi re adjustment. 65. In Virginia, t here is no state policy or legislation disallowing diagnosis(es), the conduct and interpretation of medical tests and the management (of the underlying causes, which is the epitome of chiropractic) of thyroid disease, diabetes and other metabolic diseases by chiropractors . Nor is there a ny regulation in Virginia prohibiting chiropractors from practicing as CPCPs , or Chiropractic Primary Care Provider s, or PCPs . 66. Instead, legislation, Chapter 29 of Title 54.1 of the Code of Virgi nia (\u00a7 54.1 - 2900) articulates that \" 'Healing arts' means the arts and sciences dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and cure or alleviation of human physical or mental ailments, conditions, diseases, pain or infirmities.\" 67. The only limitation s on the scope of practice for chiropractors under Virginia law are that they do not practice medicine, surgery, obstetrics, and osteopathy , or administer or prescribe drugs, medicines, serums or vaccines . Plaintiff never engaged in any of these specifica lly itemized fields. 68. Beyond these specifically -itemized fields, the scope of practice for chiropractic is quite broad and overlaps other fields of the healing arts in the areas of the treatment and management of pain, disease prevention, diagnosis, testing and medical exams, diet and the development of an appropriate treatment plan for patients. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 21 of 49 PageID# 171 22 69. Indeed, an opinion emanating from the state's attorney general's office confirms that the scope of practice for chiropractic in the Commonwealth is very broad , and only limited by specifically -excluded fields.27 70. Plaintiff's post -doctoral education and expertise in teaching, training and consulting other healthcare practitioners, as comprehensively documented to the Defendant s at the Board hearing, dictates that the us e of vitamins, minerals and food supplements based on the results of blood, saliva, stool, urine and other testing are required as the standard of care for chiropractic. 71. Moreover, the CCE accredited chiropractic degree must include both the didactic and cl inical education components of the curriculum and are structured and integrated in a manner that \"enables the graduate to demonstrate attainment of all required competencies necessary to function as a primary care chiropractic provider .\"28 As published in the Journal of Chiropractic Medicine in 2002 , thirty states allow primary care practice by licensed doctors of chiropractic. This is based on each of these state 's legislation allowing chiropractors to perform all of nine practice criteria necessary to provide primar y health care (as defined by the Institute of Medicine) . 29 72. The unrestrained and pervasive tactic by the Board and Individual Defendants to scuttle the growth and sound development of chiropractic within the Commonwealth of Virginia 27 See opinion of Acting Attorney General, in a letter addressed to the House of Delegates dated June 18, 2001 which stated in part that: \" [t]his definition (i.e. Virginia Code \u00a7 54.1-2900) expressly excludes certain modalities, but otherwise permits a broad range of practice...\" in arriving at the conclusion that physical therapy was within the scope of practice of chiropractic, even though no t specifically listed among the treatment modalities available to chiropractors under the Code. 28 CCE Accreditation Standards, Principles, Processes & Requirements for Accreditation, January 2013. 29 See United States Chiropractic Practice Acts and Primar y Institutes of Medicine Defined Primary Care Practice , by Richard Duenas, DC, DABCN, Published in Journal of Chiropractic Medicine 2002:Number 4, Volume 1:155 -170. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 22 of 49 PageID# 172 23 under the gu ise of regulating the healthcare profession and without legal justification or state backing is not limited to its direct actions against Plaintiff. For example, the Board and individual defendants, as part of their overall conspiracy, has agreed and impl emented action inhibiting doctors of chiropractic from conducting fairly routine Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") Exams, even though no logical reason supports this position and this practice is federally allowed and endorsed in about 47 states. Plain tiff would like to offer DOT exams or supervise employees in offering DOT exams, but cannot do so without certain risk of injury because of the Board and Individual Defendants' anticompetitive conduct. 73. This opinion , which is not supported by applicable law , is another attempt to circumscribe the scope of chiropractic while enlarging the scope of medical practice within the Commonwealth . These arbitrary limitations imposed on chiropractors by the Board and Individual Defendants constitute an unlawful restra int of trade against chiropractors practicing in Virginia and illegally limits competition between and among healthcare professions in the state. It is further support of Defendants participation in and coordination of a conspiracy to limit competition for medical doctors. D. Class II Low -Level Laser Device s. 74. The Board and individual defendants also sanctioned Plaintiff for her and her staff's use of a Zerona Laser (a class II low -level laser device or cold laser), even though no Virginia law prohibits the us e of such lasers by chiropractors , and there was no evidence that such use constitutes surgery (or any other activity that is actually reserved to medical doctors by Virginia law) . 75. The only previous guidance from the Board available about the use of lasers in the Commonwealth is Newsletter #71 , published by the Board in November 2011 , which concludes that laser hair removal is not a medical practice or surgery under the current laws Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 23 of 49 PageID# 173 24 applicable in Virginia. The Board's contradictory position on low -level la ser device use by chiropractors like Plaintiff is , therefore , further evidence of the Board's bias, as well as anticompetitive intent and practices. 76. The Zerona Laser device merely creates a temporary vacuum (a purely biochemical action not involving an ac tual incision or creation of a physical cavity) through which excess fat is released and metabolized . The Zerona is only a class II low -level laser device and a completely safe non -invasive therapy.30 77. Use of laser devices by chiropractors of similar clas sification as the Zerona is an approved modality for therapeutic purposes and specifically stated as allowable in a number of states including Maryland, California and Colorado . Other states like Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana and Washington sim ply state that use of \"light\" is within the scope of chiropractic . The ACA has also issued guidelines on the scope of practice for the use of low - level lasers by chiropractors.31 The NBCE Specialty Exam for Physiotherapy (which Plaintiff passed prior to her licensure) requires knowledge and application of cold laser therapy in order to pass this national specialty exam.32 78. The attempt by the Board and Individual Defendants to exclude chiropractors , and Plaintiff, from the use of benign non -ablative laser dev ices on the questionable ground that such use constitutes the practice of medicine or surgery within the Commonwealth is yet another attempt to illegally appropriate this business and practice area as the exclusive preserve of the 30 An FDA letter of approval for the Zerona Laser device under classification II of Augu st 24, 2010 states that: \"A Low Level Laser System for Aesthetic Use is a device using low level laser energy for the disruption of adipocyte cells within the fat layer for the release of fats and lipids from these cells for non -invasive aesthetic use.\" See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 878.5400. 31 American Chiropractic Association Guide for Insurance Professionals, published in 2010. 32 NBCE Written Exam Booklet, at pg. 33 shows that cold laser therapy is an included modality and knowledge of, implementation and use there of is required to pass the NBCE Specialty Exam in Physiotherapy. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 24 of 49 PageID# 174 25 medical profession , when it (1) has been approved by nationwide organizations for use by chiropractors, (2) is approved for use by chiropractors by several of the relevant state licensing boards throughout the United States, and (3) no Virginia law or regulation has been passed to authorize the Board and Individual Defendants to make such decisions to exclude such competition by chiropractors from medical doctors. E. Proscription of Plaintiff's Business Advertising and Training . 79. The Board 's order also proscribes Plaintiff's ability to lawfully and truthfully advertise her business and professional training which she has assiduously acquired and unreasonably interferes with Plaintiff's ability to practice her profession and earn her livelihood. 80. The putative regulation of Plaintiff's bus iness advertising without just cause and beyond the scope of a ny proper regulation of the health profession constitutes an undue and unreasonable restraint of trade in contravention of both state and federal antitrust laws. Moreover, the Board and Individ ual Defendant s' actions harm competition by diminishing both the choices and perceived choices for consumers considering treatment in the relevant service markets. III. CHIROPRACTORS ARE A COMPETITIVE TH REAT TO MEDICAL DOCTORS 81. As at December 2012, the following chart provides an outline of pertinent doctors licensed to practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia with corresponding complaint rate and subsequent disciplinary rates (sanctions and violations) by the Defendant.33 Doctor Type # Licensed * Complaints** Sanctions ** Violations ** Chiropractic 1,593 37.5 15.5 7.1 Medicine 33,383 39.8 8.8 4.3 Osteopathy 2,250 38.7 13.8 5.2 33 Data culled from the Department of Health Professions Biennial Reports for fiscal years 2007 - 2008, 2009 -2010 and 2011 -2012. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 25 of 49 PageID# 175 26 *As of Department of Health Professions' fiscal year end June 30, 2013. ** Number of incidents per 1,000 licensees. Determined by av eraging the rates for six fiscal years from July 1, 2006- through June 20, 2012 . . 82. The data reproduced above discloses a disturbing asymmetry in the proportion of doctors of chiropractic disciplined in the Commonwealth of Virginia vis -\u00e0-vis doctors of medicine and osteopathy in Virginia who appear to be in favor with the Board . Ironically, the complaint rate against doctors of chiropractic are the lowest of the three doctor types , yet both the sanction and violation rates found by the Board are the hi ghest for doctors of chiropractic. These statistics also support the fact that the Board and Individual Defendants are biased against chiropractors, which is consistent with the financial incentive medical doctors and other competitors of chiropractors hav e to limit the scope of chiropractic. Limiting the scope of chiropractic limits the overlap of services that chiropractors and medical doctors provide to the same set of patients. 83. The cumulative impact of systematically denying chiropractors , includin g Plaintiff , the ability to prescribe vitamins and nutrition supplements, conduct medical examinations, order and interpret tests results, or to use benign low -level laser devices and practice as CPCPs (or primary care provider s) is to effectively put the chiropractors who have been licensed in Virginia , including Plaintiff , out of business , apparently with the sole objective of having medical doctors (and other competitors of chiropractors) benefit from the commercial gap in the need for primary care provi ders that would result from the Board and Individual Defendants' unlawful and illegal conduct. 84. The fact is that Virginia medical doctors view chiropractors as a competitive threat. Instead of limiting competition to the merits, the Virginia Medical Bo ard and Individual Defendants respond to its primary constituency by limiting chiropractors' (including Plaintiff) scope of practice in areas where medical doctors and chiropractic doctors would otherwise Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 26 of 49 PageID# 176 27 compete. 85. In the current climate of outrage over medical costs, chiropractors, who generally charge less than and provide a wider range of services (including CAM) than medical doctors, become an even greater competitive threat to medical doctors. 86. Indeed, the lower -cost threat to medical doctors fr om chiropractors has recently accelerated and, absent the Board and Individual Defendant 's anticompetitive conduct, will continue to accelerate to the benefit of consumers and other medical -cost payers . This competitive threat results in part from the increased nationwide acceptance of chiropractors as primary care provider s or CPCPs . Medical doctors, including the Board and its members, seek to forestall this development from occurring in Virginia by curtailing the right of chiropractors like Plaintiff f rom offering services that directly compete with primary care provider s in Virginia. 87. A pivotal seven (7) year study in Illinois has shown , however, that the ability of chiropractors to practice as CPCPs results in a marked reduction in hospital admissi ons, hospital stays, out -patient surgeries and related procedures and costs of prescription medications compared to when reliance is placed exclusively on conventional PCPs. Furthermore, and according to the referenced study, the disease profile of Alternative Medicine Integration's (AMI's) Integrative Independen t Physicians Association (IPA) in Metropolitan Chicago, as a percentage of samples with diagnosis between 2000 (n= 491) and 2005 (n=1511) was as follows:34 34 See Clinical Utilization and Cost Outcomes From An Integrativ e Medicine Independent Physician Association: An Additional 3 -Year Update by Richard L. Sarnat, MD; James Winterstein, DC and Jerrilyn A. Cambron, DC, , Published in Journal of Physiotherapy 2007;30:263 -269. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 27 of 49 PageID# 177 28 Diagnosis In 2000 (%) In 2005 (%) Wellness 28.5% 23.4% Orthopedic 1.4% Not available 1.4% Chronic fatigue syndrome Not available 1.0% Trauma Not available 1.0% [Note that t he listed health problems are some examples of areas in which chiropractic intervention has been recorded and found to be very effective] 88. The net positive impact of allowing chiropractors in the Commonwea lth of Virginia to practice as CPCPs , or primary care providers, (without fear of retaliation from the Board) will result in reduced co -pays for medications, surgery, hospital stays, length of hospital stays, and an overall improvement in the quality of life for patients. Employers w ould see a marked reduction in yearly work hours lost, and drastic reductions in disability payments and insurance costs. Insurance comp anies would see a reduction in the cost of prescription medications, a reduction in the cost of surgery (for both in and out -patient surgeries ), a reduction in hospital stays , and a reduction in the number of needed surgical procedures actually performed annually. This also entails a reduction in premium payments and deductions for both employer s and employee s within the state. Counties in the Commonwealth of Virginia with insufficient number of PCPs will have a substantial portion of their health care needs met if chiropractors Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 28 of 49 PageID# 178 29 were allowed to join the ranks (again, without fear o f retaliation from the Board and individual defendants ) of osteopathic and medical doctors currently practicing as PCPs in th ose areas. Currently , and even with an estimated 24,1 93 osteopaths and medical doctors in active practice , at least 78 out of 144 counties and independent cities in Virginia (54.2 percent) continue to experience primary care shortage both in terms of geographic spread and the availability of PCPs across the populat ion (Health Care Professions - Primary Care Physician - shortage areas ).35 2011 2011 cost % of total budget 2011 cost per person * AMI Study CPCP ** Reduce % Cost Savings per patient: Savings with 200,000 Patients Switch to CPCP *** Savings with 300,000 Patients Switch to CPCP *** Inpatient Hospital Stays $910.7 million 12.7 $917.30 Hospital Admissions 60.2 $552.22 $110.44 Million per year $165.67 Million per year Pharmacy $168.2 million 2.3 $169. 42 Pharmaceutical Costs 80.5% $136. 38 $27.28 Million per year $40.91 Million per year *992,800 people enrolled in Medicaid in 2011 ** Chiropractic Primary Care Provider ***Projection of 100 Virginia DCs Practicing as PCPs managing 2,000 or 3 ,000, respectively, patients each (calculated by percent of 992,800 recipients that switch to CPCP multiplied by cost savings per patient.) 89. From the conservative projections above, both the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Federal government combined could save between $ 137.72 and $ 206.58 million per year on Medicaid expenditures alone , which generally pays the lowest allowable amount of any healthcare coverage. This projection does not even factor in other cost savings that could accrue to Virginia as a result of the reduction in hospital stays and unnecessa ry pharmaceutical costs , which are not prescribed by chiropractic doctors . 35 Data culled on 8/11/13 from the US Department of Health and Human Resources Health Services and Resources Administration (www.hhs.gov). Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 29 of 49 PageID# 179 30 IV. THE BOARD'S ANTICOMP ETITIVE CONDUCT HARM ED INTERSTATE COMMERCE 90. Defendant s' conduct and agreements were intended to and did substantially harm and affect a substantial amount of interstate commerce. 91. Health care activity within the states, including Virginia, is inextricably intertwined. For example, health -care providers purchase products for their services from other states, and insurance companies located throughout the fif ty-states often pay for these services. Indeed, as the national debate over healthcare and Obama -care recognize s, healthcare costs and service s are a national problem, regardless of the proposed solutions. V. THE RELEVANT PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC MARKE TS AND M ARKET POWER 92. The relevant service markets for purposes of this action are (1) therapeutic and aesthetic treatments with Class II Low -Level Laser devices; (2) diagnosis, management, and treatments of Type II diabetes and its underlying causes; (3) diagno sis, management, and treatments for thyroid diseases; (4) diagnosis, management, and treatments for metabolic disease; and (5) Primary Care Provider or CPCP services (collectively, with the relevant geographic market, the \"relevant service markets\"). 93. The relevant geographic market for each of these relevant service markets is the Commonwealth of Virginia. Competing medical service providers, including chiropractors and medical doctors, must be licensed in Virginia to practice in Virginia. The vast maj ority of patients do not travel out -of-state for each of the relevant service markets , and would not trav el out-of-state in reaction to a sustained price increase. 94. Chiropractors, including Plaintiff, compete with medical doctors to perform therapeutic and aesthetic treatments with Class II Low -Level Laser devices. Plaintiff only discontinued these treatments upon the advice of her attorney, as she faced further disciplinary Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 30 of 49 PageID# 180 31 action, including suspension and fines, from the Board. Absent the Board and Individual Defendant s' anticompetitive conduct, Plaintiff would continue to perform these treatments , which are not prohibited under Virginia law . 95. Chiropractors, including Plaintiff, also compete with medical doctors to diagnose, manage, and treat Type II diabetes and its underlying causes. Plaintiff and other chiropractors do so through diet, nutrition, and lifestyle counseling. Absent the anticompetitive conduct of the Board and Individual Defendant s, Plaintiff and other chiropractors would continue to diagnose, manage, and treat the underlying causes of Type II diabetes , all of which are not prohibited under Virginia law . 96. Chiropractors, including Plaintiff, also compete with medical doctors to diagnose, manage, and treat thyroid disease. Plainti ff and other chiropractors do so, in part, by ordering medical tests and conducting examinations. Absent the anticompetitive conduct of the Board and Individual Defendants , Plaintiff and other chiropractors would continue to diagnose, manage, and treat the underlying causes of thyroid disease , all of which are not prohibited under Virginia law . 97. Chiropractors, including Plaintiff, also compete with medical doctors to diagnose, manage, and treat metabolic disease. Plaintiff and other chiropractors do so , in part, by ordering medical tests and conducting examinations. Absent the Board and Individual Defendant s' anticompetitive conduct, Plaintiff and other chiropractors would continue to diagnose, manage, and treat the underlying causes of metabolic disea se, all of which are not prohibited under Virginia law . 98. The Virginia Medical Board and Individual Defendants have and exercise the power to exclude medical doctors, chiropractors and others from competing in the relevant Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 31 of 49 PageID# 181 32 service markets. The Board and Individual Defendants have the power and perceived power to suspend chiropractic licenses, issue fines, and order chiropractors and others to take or refrain from certain conduct. Thus, the Board and Individual Defendants have the power, which they have exercised here, to exclude competition within the relevant service markets. VI. THE VIRGINIA BOARD O F MEDICINE AND INDIVIDUAL DEFEN DANTS ENGAGED IN ANTICOMPE TITIVE CONDUCT 99. The Defendant Board of Medicine and Individual Defendants are colluding to exclud e chiropractors and non -medical doctor personnel from competing with medical doctors in the relevant service markets. These actions in turn increase prices , reduce the supply of services, and reduce consumer choice in the relevant service markets without any legitimate justification, defense, or efficiencies. They also reduce the overall quality of services that customers receive from health care providers. 100. For example , Defendants conspired to forbid and deter Plaintiff and other chiropractors from usin g a Class II Low -Level Laser device in their practice for the purpose of eliminating competition in one or more relevant service markets . Indeed, Plaintiff herself was ordered by the Board and Individual Defendants to cease an d desist from using that devi ce, despite the fact that using such a device is within scope of chiropractic and not prohibited or restricted under Virginia law or the Board's own regulations . 101. Defendants prevent and deter chiroprac tors from using these low -level laser devices despi te the fact that Virginia law neither reserves the right to use these devices to medical doctors only, nor prohibits Virginia chiropractors from using them. This device does not result in an actual incision or the creation of a physical cavity ; in fact the FDA defined this laser as non -invasive, and using this device does not constitute the practice of medicine or surgery under any Virginia law . Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 32 of 49 PageID# 182 33 102. In fact, these devices are commonly used by chiropractors throughout the country, and several states even e xplicitly include them as within the scope of chiropractic. Moreover, the ACA has issued guidelines on these lasers for chiropractors, and the NBCE Specialty Exam for Phys iotherapy \u2014which Plaintiff passed prior to licensure \u2014requires knowledge and applicati on of this cold laser therapy to pass this specialty exam. 103. The result and intent of the Defendants' actions in prohibiting Plaintiff and other chiropractors from using the class II low -level laser device is to remov e and eliminate Virginia competition for medical doctors from chiropractors and others in the use of these devices and for treating the conditions that these devices treat. This conduct has restrained competition and injured consumers by limiting the supply of laser -device services, thus in creasing prices and reducing choice for consumers. Moreover, the Board and Individual Defendant s' actions in restraining competition for the use of low -level laser devices lack any legitimate efficiency or pro-competitive justifications , and such actions are not supported under Virginia law . 104. Defendants have also conspired to forbid and deter Plaintiff and other chiropractors from tre ating the underlying causes of T ype II diabetes and other conditions through diet, n utrition, and lifestyle counseli ng. Indeed, Plaintiff was ordered by Defendants on February 28, 2013 to cease these treatments. 105. The Board and Individual Defendants prevent and deter chiropractors from treating Type II diabetes and other conditions thr ough diet, nutrition, and lifestyle counseling despite the fact that Virginia law neither reserves the right to treating these conditions to medical doctors, nor prohibits chiropractors from treating these conditions. Indeed, Plaintiff is expressly permitted under the Health Regulations VAC 18 85-20-40.C to recommend and direct patients regarding the use of diet and food supplements and the use of vitamins and minerals in Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 33 of 49 PageID# 183 34 accordance with the standards of her branch of the healing arts. 106. To obtain a Virginia chiropractic license, a doct or of chiropractic must graduate from a Chiropractic Council on Education accredited school and pass the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners parts I -IV examinations. These standards, in fact, require the aspiring doctor of chiropractic to demonstrate proficiency in areas like nutrition, patient diagnosis, lab testing, urine testing, and differential diagnosis. Thus, the standards for licensure in Virginia \u2014 and therefore Virginia law \u2014entail qualifications to treat certain conditions through nutrition, testing, and diagnosis. Under Virginia law, chiropractors compete with doctors for the treatment of certain conditions, like Type II diabetes. 107. Moreover, the treatment of Type II diabetes normalizes the transmission of nerve energy \u2014a hallmark of chir opractic treatment \u2014by lowering blood sugar levels. 108. Defendant s' actions in prevent ing and deterring chiropractors from treating Type II diabetes and other health conditions through diet, nutrition, and lifestyle counseling has the intent and effect of limiting competition from chiropractors to medical doctors for the treatment of these conditions. These actions have restrained competition and injured Virginia consumers by limiting the supply of services for these conditions, thus increasing prices and reducing choice for consumers. The use of nutrition, diet, and supplements to treat various conditions is a growing and potentially profitable area of treatment by medical doctors, so the Board and Individual Defendants have a particularly strong incentiv e to limit and eliminat e direct competition from chiropractors. Moreover, Defendants' actions in restraining competition for these services lack any legitimate efficiency or pro -competitive justification , as well as any justification under Virginia law . 109. Defendants have also conspired to limit and eliminate direct competition from Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 34 of 49 PageID# 184 35 chiropractors for medical doctors by prohibiting Plaintiff and other chiropractors from ordering medical tests or conducting examinations for the treatment of thyroid disease , diabetes, and metabolic disease . Indeed, the Board \u2014made up of primarily medical doctors , including the Individual Defendants \u2014specifically held in its Order suspending Plaintiff's license that chiropractic in Virginia cannot include \"the diagnosis, managemen t, or treatment of thyroid disease, diabetes, metabolic disease, or interpreting tests or examinations.\" Nor, ordered the Board, can a chiropractic practice include the \"prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human physical or mental ailments, conditions, diseases, pain or infirmities by any means or method.\" In other words, the Board and Individual Defendants , without any legal authority, seek to reduce competition from licensed chiropractors by reserv ing the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of any of these conditions as a monopoly for themselves. These pronouncements will have the intended effect of deterring and prohibiting non-medical doctors from engaging in these activities. 110. Virginia law does not prohibit chiropractors from preventing, diagn osing, or treating thyroid disease, diabetes, metabolic disease , incorporating CAM or interpreting tests or examinations. Virginia law also does not prohibit chiropractors from preventing, diagnosing, and treating human physical and mental ailments, condi tions, diseases, pain or infirmities. Nor does Virginia law carve out to medical doctors a monopoly to prevent, diagnose, and treat these physical and mental ailments, conditions, diseases, pain or infirmities (practicing as a P rimary Care Provider, or CP CP). The legal limitations under Virginia law on the scope of practice for chiropractors are that they do not practice medicine, surgery, obstetrics, and osteopathy , or administer or prescribe drugs, medicines, serums or vaccines. See Virginia Code \u00a7 54.1 -2900. Defendants conspired to expand these limitations to other areas, previously permitted under Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 35 of 49 PageID# 185 36 Virginia law , with the purpose and effect of limiting and eliminating competition from chiropractors. 111. In fact, these activities \u2014the prevention, diagnos is, and treatment of physical and mental ailments \u2014fall within the traditional scope of chiropractic , and the Commonwealth of Virginia has specifically reserve d these activities to practi tioners of the healing arts, one of such being chiropractors. [See Chapter 29 of Title 54.1 of the Code of Virginia (\u00a7 54.1 -2900) and most specifically \u00a7 54.1 -2903 ]. Virginia legislation expressly allow ed these activities to chiropractors licensed in Virginia , until the Board's Order against Plaintiff prohibited chiropracto rs from doing so, in defiance of and unbeknownst to the Virginia legislat ure. To illustrate, the CCE actually mandates case -appropriate physical examinations by chiropractors that involve evaluating body regions and organ systems, to assist the chiropract or in developing a proper diagnosis. Moreover, a chiropractor's training involves conducting diagnostic studies and consultations (including imaging clinical laboratory and specialized testing procedures) to collate objective clinical data; formulating di agnosis from a patient's medical history, examination, and diagnostic studies; generating problem lists with diagnoses after synthesizing and correlating data from patient history, physical exams, diagnostic tests and other necessary follow -up consultation s. These are the hallmarks of practice as a PCP or CPCP primary care provider . 112. Defendants' conspiracy to harm competition is not limited to its actions against Plaintiff \u2014and the resulting direct and deterrent effects of those actions. Plaintiff is m erely one significant victim of the conspiracy. For example, on September 9, 2013, Defendants issued an Order against another chiropractor forbidding him from performing comprehensive physical examinations for commercial driver's license (\"Department of T ransportation Exams\"). Defendants did so even though federal law and other states expressly permit chiropractors to Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 36 of 49 PageID# 186 37 perform these examinations and Virginia law does not prohibit them from doing so. Defendants, once again, conspired to reserve a monopoly f or these exams in Virginia to medical doctors. 113. The Board and Individual D efendants interfered with Plaintiff's contracts, prospective contracts, and prospective business opportunities by violating Directors' Policies in posting the sanction against Plaintiff before Plaintiff's time to appeal had expired, and in failing to include notice that Plaintiff had indeed appealed the decision. This action by Defendants had the predictable, foreseeable, and intended result of prompting an avalanche of claims and investigations by former clients, third -party insurers, and the federal governme nt relating to past paid insurance claims and p ayments for legitimate services. These claims for reimbursement and refunds have and will create substantial financial, reputational, and irreparable injury to Plaintiff and her business. Defendants' communica tion harmed competition itself, not only by harming a significant competitor, but by deterring other chiropractors from competing with medical doctors and doctors of osteopathy, as the harm from defendants' improper and illegal communication predictably in jures a targeted business beyond repair. Defendants' communication also unlawfully interfered with Plaintiffs' contracts, prospective contracts, and prospective economic advantage. 114. The Board and Individual Defendants additionally interfered with Plaintiff and other chiropractors' ability to compete in the relevant markets by advising third -party clinical laboratories not to do busin ess with chiropractors in Virginia based upon the Defendants' false representations that Virginia law prohibits these chiropractors from contracting with these laboratories to run certain tests. Running these tests is necessary for chiropractors in Virgin ia to compete with doctors in the relevant markets. For example, after requesting that Fry Laboratories, LLC run certain tests for Plaintiff's client, Fry Laboratories responded to Plaintiff Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 37 of 49 PageID# 187 38 that the Virginia State Board of Medicine advised Fry Laboratori es that running these tests for Virginia chiropractors violated Virginia State law. Based upon these false representations by the Board and Individual Defendants , Fry Laboratories declined to do business with Plaintiff. Thus, by using the false color of state law to advise third -parties not to deal with chiropractors in Virginia, Defendants engaged in anticompetitive acti ons, including boycott activity, that directly harmed competition and Plaintiff. VII. ANTITRUST INJURY 115. Without effect ive relief, the exc lusionary conduct by the Board and Individual Defendants continue. As a result of the Defendant s' conduct , the availability of services for consumers in the relevant service markets has been and will be significantly diminished. Defendants' conduct will have the intended effect of deterring and prohibiting non -Medical doctors from offering services in the relevant service markets. Chiropractors, including Plaintiff, are unable to compete in these markets, despite the fact that consumers seek their servic es, and seek alternatives to medical doctors. As a result of this diminished competition, consumers will pay higher prices for services in th e relevant service markets, and have fewer provider or primary care provider choices. They will also receive lowe r-quality care. 116. Innovation in the relevant service markets will also suffer as an entire profession, chiropractic, is unable to offer its unique perspective on treating a wide -range of conditions. Indeed, as evident by the medical profession's attempt to eliminate chiropractic over the years, chiropractic professionals are \"maverick\" and \"disruptive\" competitors to medical doctors that require medical doctors to compete more efficiently and effectively to win the business of consumers. Without chiropr actic competition as primary -care provider s, medical doctors can continue to follow a predictable and complacent course of treatment with minimal competitive interruption. Thus, the quality of services provided by primary care provider s will also diminish Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 38 of 49 PageID# 188 39 and has diminished without chiropractic competition. 117. Ultimately, by foreclosing competition, Defendants ' conduct increases prices and reduces the quality and quantity of options for consumers in the relevant service markets. 118. Defendant s' exclusi onary conduct directly harmed Plaintiff by foreclosing and preclud ing Plaintiff from competing with medical doctors in the relevant service markets. Plaintiff has sustained and will continue to sustain significant economic and financial loss from Defendan ts' anticompetitive conduct. First, she is unable and will continue to be unable to treat customers within the relevant service markets. Second, the Board and Individual Defendants caused Plaintiff's chiropractic license to be suspended for at least six months (already effective) , so she is unable to treat any chiropractic patient s during that time. Third, the Board ordered Plaintiff to pay $25,000. Fourth, as a result of Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff can only practice chiropractic if she agrees not to compete with medical doctors in the relevant service markets , although there is no Virginia law to support this exclusionary position . Fifth, the Board and Individual Defendants ordered Plaintiff to harm her own reputation (and future business) by sendin g certified letters to all current patients notifying them that her license is suspended. Defendants also ordered Plaintiff to provide similar notifications to all hospitals and other medical facilities where she is granted privileges, and to all insuranc e companies that reimburse her for any of her services . Sixth, the Plaintiff sold her Zerona laser at a loss and sustained loss of income from this revenue stream as a direct conse quence of Board's orders . Seventh, the Board damaged Plaintiff's reputatio n and business by posting the February 28, 2013 Order in defiance of the Department of Health Profession Director's Policy # 76 -3.1. Seventh, insurance companies, including the federal government, are have demanded that Plaintiff return amounts previously paid by these companies as a direct result of defendants' conduct. Eighth, previous Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 39 of 49 PageID# 189 40 patients are demanding refunds from Plaintiff as a result of Defendants' conduct. Ninth, insurance companies, including the federal government, have threatened Plaintiff s' ability to obtain reimbursement in the future for legitimate insurable services to her patients. These injuries to Plaintiff result from the anticompetitive nature of Defendants ' conduct, which resulted from Plaintiff's lawful competition with medical doctors and other primary care provider s. 119. The severity of Defendants' conduct also chills possible future competition for medical doctors from chiropractors and others within the relevant service markets. Indeed, the Board and Individual D efendants i ntentionally sought to make an example of Plaintiff to deter other chiropractors and alternative care providers from competing with medical doctors, including Individual Defendants, in Virginia. Absent an order from this Court, both Plaintiff and competit ion in the relevant service markets will continue to suffer harm arising out of Defendants ' anticompetitive conduct. VIII. STATE ACTION IMMUNIT Y 120. The Defendant Virginia Board of Medicine is not a sovereign -state entity within the federal system, but instead is a quasi -public, quasi -private entity that is made up primarily of medical doctors who compet e with Plaintiff . These medical doctors are participants or potential participants in the relevant markets. 121. Defendant s may not invoke state -action immuni ty for its anticompetitive conduct because the conduct was not clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy, and is not actively supervised by the Commonwealth of Virginia. To the contrary, Defendant s' conduct contravenes Virginia law. Neither the Commonwealth of Virginia, nor its law s, contemplate that the Board, consisting primarily of medical doctors, could or would eliminate competition for these and other medical doctors from profession als like chiropractors in areas where chiropra ctors have commonly practice d, such as being recognized as primary care provider s. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 40 of 49 PageID# 190 41 Defendants ' conduct cannot be attributed to the sovereign state \u2014it was instead the independent result of the Board acting through Board members , with pecuniary interests in restricting competition from chiropractors and other non -medical doctors. The Individual Defendants are market participants that compete with Plaintiff and Virginia chiropractors and have economic incentives and interests in narrowing the scope of chirop ractic practice. CLAIM S FOR RELIEF Count 1 Violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act (All Defendants) 122. Plaintiff incorporates by reference as though fully set forth herein the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 121. 123. Defendants ' conduct violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, because The Board , along with Individual Defendants, entered an agreement to allocate the entire relevant service markets , including the number of Primary Care Providers that could operate in Virginia, to medic al doctors, and excluded and forec losed chiropractors, including Plaintiff, from competing in those market s. The agreement and conspiracy included Defendants' decision to sanction Plaintiff for competing with medical doctors in the relevant markets (inclu ding the February 28, 2013 Order) , but also included conduct distinct and separate from that decision. For example, the agreement and conspiracy also included Defendants' efforts to inappropriately publicize their sanction before the state appeal was comp leted to enhance the deterrence effects of their conduct on other chiropractors, Defendants' efforts to deter and restrain chiropractors (including Plaintiff) from offering DOT exams, and Defendants' inappropriate interference with Plaintiff and chiropract ors' ability to order appropriate tests throughout third -party testing facilities. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 41 of 49 PageID# 191 42 124. Defendant s' conduct is a per se violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act because it involves a horizontal agreement among competitors to allocate markets and exclude competitors, including Plaintiff , from the relevant service markets. 125. In the alternative, Defendant s' conduct violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act under the rule of reason, or quick -look analysis. 126. Defendant s have sufficient market and monopoly pow er over the relevant service markets to appreciably restraint free competition in these markets. 127. Defendants ' conduct and agreements harm competition in the relevant service markets by excluding chiropractors, including Plaintiff, from competing within them. Moreover, Defendant s' conduct and agreements discourage all non -medical doctors from competing within those markets. 128. Defendants also engaged in a group boycott against Plaintiff. Defendants and Plaintiff are all horizontal competitors in the relevan t markets. As part of defendants' agreement and conspiracy, defendants communicated with third parties that do business with Plaintiff or might do business with Plaintiff, and convinced them not to do business with Plaintiff. Defendants' conduct harmed Pla intiff because Plaintiff's inability to do business with third -party testing facilities and insurance companies, for example, make it impossible to compete with defendants in the relevant markets. 129. Defendant s' conduct and agreements have and will, as a result, increase prices and decrease the quality and quantity of servic es in the relevant service markets. 130. As a result of Defendant s' anticompetitive conduct, Plaintiff has been and will continue to be injured through significant economic and financial loss, the loss of current and future business, reputational damage , and the inability or difficulty to seek reimbursement Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 42 of 49 PageID# 192 43 through third -party insurers . Thus, Plaintiff has suffered antitrust injury from Defendants ' anticompetitive conduct, which has harmed both competition and Plaintiff. 131. Defendants ' conduct and agreem ents w as intended to and did substantially harm and affect a substantial amount of interstate commerce. 132. Defendants ' conduct and agreements do not qualify for state action immunity, nor are they reasonably related to any efficiencies or other benefits sufficient to justify their harmful effects on competition in the relevant service markets. The anticompetitive harm from Defendants ' conduct and agreements substantially outweigh the non -existent efficiency and competitive benefits. 133. Plaintiff is ent itled to recover treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15, and to injunctive relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26. Count 2 Violation of Intentional Interference with Existing Contracts under Virginia State Law (Individual Defendants) 134. Plaintiff incorpora tes by reference as though fully set forth herein the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 133. 135. Plaintiff has, or had, a valid contractual relationship or business expectancy with her clients, with insurance companies, with third -party testing companie s, and with government agencies or programs, such as Medicare, all with a probability of future economic benefit to Plaintiff. 136. The Individual Defendants are competitors and potential competitors of Plaintiff in the relevant markets , and knew and conti nue to know of the existence of Plaintiff's valid business relationships and expectancies. 137. The Individual Defendants intentionally interfered with Plaintiff's existing Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 43 of 49 PageID# 193 44 contracts , thereby inducing or causing a breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy. Defendants interfered in numerous ways, including anticompetitive conduct, improper communication with third -parties that contract with Plaintiff and improper publicizing of the Board decision sanctioning Plaintiff (despite the pendency of P laintiff's appeal and Virginia laws and policies that prohibit Defendants' conduct). 138. The Individual Defendants' actions against Plaintiff wer e not legal and have damage d Plain tiff and disrupted her relationship or expectancy with existing contracts . 139. The Indivi dual Defendants' actions were and are without privilege or justification and were engaged in through improper means. 140. It is reaso nably certain that, absent the Individual Defendants' intentional misconduct, Plaintiff would have continued in her contracts or realized her expectancy of future economic benefit. 141. As a result of the Individual Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff's goodwill with her client s has been diminished, and the Individual Defendants have diverted \u2014and will divert \u2014 future bu siness to the Individual Defendants and other medical doctors that would have gone to Plaintiff. 142. The foregoing conduct by the Individual Defendants constitutes intentional interference with Plaintiff's contracts, and a disruption of Plaintiff's relati onship or expectancy, under Virginia common law. 143. As a consequence of the foregoing, Plaintiff has been and continues to be damaged by the actio ns of the I ndividual Defendants , and Plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive relief against the Individual Defendants. Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 44 of 49 PageID# 194 45 Count 3 Violation of Intentional Interference with Prospective Contracts under Virginia State Law (Individual Defendants) 144. Plaintiff incorporates by reference as though fully set forth herein the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 143. 144. Plaintiff has the expectancy of prospective contracts with her existing and future clients, with insurance companies, with third -party testing companies, and with government agencies or programs, such as Medicare, all with a probability of future econom ic benefit to Plaintiff. 145. The Individual Defendants are competitors and potential competitors of Plaintiff in the relevant markets, and knew and continue to know of the existence of Plaintiff's prospective contracts. 146. The Individual Defendants inte ntionally interfered with Plaintiff's existing expectancy of prospective contracts, and have used improper, sometimes illegal, means or methods to interfere with Plaintiff's expectancy of prospective contracts. Defendants interfered in numerous ways, incl uding anticompetitive conduct, improper communication with third - parties with prospective contracts with Plaintiff and improper publicizing of the Board decision sanctioning Plaintiff (despite the pendency of Plaintiff's appeal and Virginia laws and polici es that prohibit Defendants' conduct). 147. The Individual Defendants' actions against Plaintiff were not legal and have damage d Plaintiff and disrupted her relationship or expectancy of contracts . 148. The Individual Defendants' actions were and are witho ut privilege or justification and were engaged in through improper means. 149. It is reasonably certain that, absent the Individual Defendants' intentional Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 45 of 49 PageID# 195 46 misconduct, Plaintiff would hav e realized her expectancy of future economic benefit. 150. As a resul t of the Individual Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff has been and continues to be damaged by the disruption of her contract expectancy. 151. The foregoing conduct by the Individual Defendants constitutes intentional interfe rence with Plaintiff's prospective contracts under Virginia common law. 152. As a consequence of the foregoing, Plaintiff has been and continues to be damaged by the Individual Defendants' actions, and Plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive relief against the Individual Defendants. Count 4 Violation of Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage under Virginia State Law (Individual Defendants) 153. Plaintiff incorporates by reference as though fully set forth herein the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 152. 154. Plain tiff has developed a suc cessful business that has had business relationship s or expectancies with a probability of future economic benefit to Plaintiff. 155. The Individual Defendants are competitors and potential competitors of Plaintiff in the relevant m arkets, and they had knowledge of Plaintiff's business relationships or expectancies, including her designation of a primary -care provider for an increasing number of patients. 156. The Individual Defendants intentionally interfered with Plaintiff's prosp ective business or caused the breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy. Indeed, the Individual Defendants have used improper, sometimes illegal, means or methods to interfere with Plaintiff's exp ectancy and relationships . Defendants interf ered in numerous ways, including anticompetitive conduct, improper communication with third -parties with prospective Case 1:13-cv-01486-CMH-TRJ Document 12-1 Filed 02/03/14 Page 46 of 49 PageID# 196 47 contracts with Plaintiff and improper publicizing of the Board decision sanctioning Plaintiff (despite the pendency of Plaintiff's appeal a nd Virginia laws and policies that prohibit Defendants' conduct). 157. Based upon Plaintiff's past business, there is a reasonable certainty that, absent the Individual Defendants' intentional misconduct, Plaintiff would have continued in the relationship or realized the expectancy. 158. Individual Defendants' conduct therefore constitutes intentional interference with Plaintiff's prospective business or economic advantage under Virginia common law. 159. The Individual Defendants' actions were and are witho ut privilege or justification and were engaged in through improper means. 160. As a consequence of the foregoing, Plaintiff has been and continues to be damaged by the actions of the I ndividual Defendants ,' and Plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive relief against the Individual Defendants.
