Introduction from the McLean County Community Health Council 's Executive Steering Committee The formation of the McLean County Community Health Council in April 2015 marked an important milestone for community health in McLean County. Prior to this collaborative assessment, the two hospitals in McLean County and the McLean County Health Department each conducted their own community health needs assessment which resulted in three community health plans for the County. During the same ti me, United Way of McLean County conducted a broad -based community needs assessment (CHNA) . As a result of the collaboration, the four organizations listed above developed the joint 2016 McLean County CHNA Report and joint McLean County 2017 - 2019 Communit y Health Improvement Plan. For the 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment, Chestnut Health Systems joined as a collaborative partner in place of United Way for this joint report. Chestnut Health Systems, like the hospitals, is required by f ederal guidelines to complete a community health needs assessment every three years. United Way is not required to complete a community health needs assessment ; however, United Way remained on the McLean County Community Health Council for the 2019 assessm ent. a) Philosophy and Development of Collaborative All four organizations are members of the McLean County Community Health Council, which is dedicated to improving the health of the community and strongly believe s in the philosophy of collaboration. Collaborating in a more effective manner was identified as the primary learning opportunity from the previous community health needs assessments. The involved organizations determined that the community health needs ass essment for McLean County could be conducted more efficiently and effectively by pooling resources. Collaborating was also identified as the key for a successful implementation plan that would make impactful and sustainable community health improvements in McLean County. For the above reasons, the McLean County Community Health Council was formed for the creation of a joint community health needs assessment followed by one community health implementation plan for McLean County. b) Community Health Needs Ass essment Report Approval Advocate BroMenn Medical Center and OSF St. Joseph Medical Center are utilizing this joint CHNA Report in conjunction with the McLean County Health Department and Chestnut Health Systems to meet their 201 9 Community Health Needs Assessment requirements under 501(r) added to the Internal Revenue Code by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The McLean County Health Department will also utilize this report and subsequent community health implementat ion plan to meet IPLAN requirements for local health department certification by the Illinois Department of Public Health. Chestnut Health Systems is utilizing this report to meet the Health Resources & Services Administration's compliance expectation that Federally Qualified Health Centers complete a needs 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 10 assessment at least once every three years for the purposes of informing and improving the delivery of health center services. Advocate BroMenn Medical Center , the McLean County Health Department, OSF St. Joseph Medical Center and Chestnut Health Systems are the primary organizations responsible for guiding community health improvement plans that will be developed based upon this community health needs assessment. Like the 2017 - 2019 McLean County Com munity Health Improvement Plan, the 2020 - 2022 Community Health Improvement Plan will be developed in partnership with other community social service agencies and organizations. This plan was approved by Chestnut Health Systems ' Board of Directors on July 24, 2019, Advocate BroMenn Medical Center and Advocate Eureka Hospital's Governing Council on July 23, 201 9, the McLean County Board of Health on July 10th , 2019 and OSF HealthCare System's Board of Directors on July 29, 201 9. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 11 II. Executive Summar y Advocate BroMenn Medical Center, Chestnut Health Systems , the McLean County Health Department and OSF St. Joseph Medical Center collaborated to conduct the 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment and to adopt a joint CHNA Report . In 2016, th e two hospitals and the health department also collaborated with United Way of McLean County to conduct the 2016 C ommunity Health Needs Assessment for McLean County and to adopt a joint CHNA Report . This exciting and unique opportunity is possible, according to the final Treasury regulations adopted to implement 501(r), which was added to the Internal Revenue Code by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as all four entities define their service area as McLean County. The goals of this collaborative effort are as follows: Analyze data collectively in conducting the CHNA Prioritize the significant health needs Generate the joint 2019 CHNA Report Work collaboratively to generate the joint 2020 - 2022 McLean County C ommunity Health Improvement Plan addressing each of the significant health needs or explaining why a significant health need is not being addressed. One member from each of the four organizations sits on the Executive Steering Committee which oversees the Community Health Needs Assessment and Community Health Improvement Plan. The Executive Steering Committee falls under the umbrella of the McLean County Community Health Council which consists of 52 individuals representing 39 organizations from the following sectors : County and city government Education Public health Business/economic development Social services Faith Transportation Law enforcement Housing Civic organizations/service clubs Healthcare . In the fall and winter of 2018 - 2019 , the Executive Steering Comm ittee analyze d the primary and secondary data , accumulated from a variety of sources, presented in this report. By considering the criteria below, the Executive Steering Committee identified the significant health issues to present to the McLean County Com munity Health Council for prioritization. Size of the issue Rates w orse than rates of Illinois counties or the state rate Disparities by race/ethnicity, age, gender or ZIP code Does not meet the Healthy People 2020 target . 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 12 a) Six Significant Health Needs Identified for Prioritization The six significant health needs that were presented to the McLean County Community Health Council for prioritization were: Access to Appropriate Care Behavioral Health (mental health and substance use) Healthy Eating and Active Living (exercise, nutrition, obesity and food access/insecurity) Heart Disease Oral Health Respiratory Disease . McLean County Community Health Council Prioritization Meeting s The Executive Steering Committee facilitated t hree meetings of the McLean County Community Health Council to prioritiz e the health needs derived from the data analysis: January 31, 2019 The purpose of the first meeting was to explain the collaborative nature of the 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment with Adv ocate BroMenn Medical Center, the McLean County Health Department, OSF St. Joseph Medical Center and Chestnut Health Systems , with the end goal of producing a joint community health improvement plan for McLean County. Highlights from 2017 and 2018 for the 2017 - 2019 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan were also reviewed with the council. February 14, 2019 During the second meeting, the Executive Steering Committee presented detailed data on the six significant health needs identified for prioritization. Age, gender, race/ethnic and ZIP code disparities were shared when available. A group discussion was facilitated on the health issues presented. February 28, 2019 During the final prioritization meeting, the Hanlon Method of prioritization was used to select the three significant health needs for the 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment and around which the 2020 - 2022 McLean County Co mmunity Health Improvement P lan will be developed. Health Needs Selected to be Addressed The following three significant health needs were selected by the McLean County Community Health Council to be addressed in the 2020 -2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan : Access to Appropriate Care Behavioral Health (including Mental Health and Substance Abuse) Healthy Eating/Active Living . 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 13 Health Needs Not Addressed The three health needs that were not selected were heart disease, oral health and respiratory disease. The council acknowledged the importance of all three of these issues, but the prioritization scores for the three selected issues were higher than those for the issues not sel ected. b) Priority Action Teams Assembled In April and May 2019, three priority action team meetings were held to establish a high -level goal for each health priority. Priority action teams consist of key community stakeholders with an interest or expertis e in the prioritized significant health need . Cross -sector representation was sought for each priority action team. The goals for each of the health priorities identified are listed below: 2020 - 2022 Health Priority Goals Access to Appropriate Care Ensure appropriate access to care to improve the health and well -being of our residents, neighborhoods and county by 2023. Behavioral Health Advance a systemic community approach to enhance behavioral health and well -being by 2023. Healthy Eating/Active Li ving Promote healthy eating and active living to strengthen the health and well -being of our community by 2023. In the fall of 2019, the priority action teams will meet to determine the resources, interventions and outcome metrics for each of the three health priorities . The 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan will again be a joint plan for the entire county and consist of interventions and resources for the hospitals, health department, family health center and numerous social s ervice s or other community organizations.

Summary of the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment and the 2017 - 2019 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan a) Community Definition For the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment, the McLean County Community Health Council defined the community as McLean County, the primary service area for Advocate BroMenn Medical Center , the McLean County Health Department, OSF St. Joseph Medical Center and Chestnut Family Health Center. This area includes the following cities and towns: Anchor, McLean, Merna, Normal, Saybrook, Stanford and Towanda. b) Communities with Highest SocioNeeds Index Values Social and economic factors are strong determinants of health outcomes. Six factors are utilized by Conduent Healthy Communities Institute to create Socio Needs county rankings (1 - 5) and national in dex values (1 - 100) for all the ZIP codes in McLean County. The six factors include: Poverty Education Unemployment Occupation Income Language . High values are associated with the highest socioeconomic need, which is correlated with preventable hospitalizations and premature death. For t he 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment, there were four ZIP codes with a ranking of five , which represent ed the areas with the highest socioeconomic needs in McLean County at that time : Bloomington ZIP code 61701 36,197 residents Cheno a ZIP code 61726 2,678 residents ZIP code 61728 1,486 residents Stanford ZIP code 61774 952 residents In addition to the above, Normal ha d one ZIP code, 61761, which h ad a county ranking of four and a population of 54,431.

The assessment process for the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment consisted of the following: Establish the McLea n County Community Health Council Analyze data collectively Prioritize and select the top three significant health needs for McLean County Generate a joint community health needs assessment for McLean County Work collaboratively on a joint community health implementation plan addressing each of the top three health priorities with other key community stakeholders . d) Needs Identified and Priorities Selected In February 2016, 13 health issues that the data suggested were health problems were presented to the McLean County Community Health Council. The 13 issues that rose to the top as potential health concerns for McLean County in 2016 are listed below in alphabetical order: Alzheimer's and Dementia Birth Outcomes Cancer Cesarean Section Heart Disease Ment al Health Obesity Oral Health Radon Respiratory Disease Sexually Transmitted Diseases Substance Abuse Violent Crime . During the first McLean County Community Health Council meeting in February 2016, robust data was presented on the 13 health issues which were then narrowed to six health issues to be prioritized during the next meeting. It is important to note that althou gh it was not presented as one of the 13 health concerns, access to appropriate healthcare continually came up as an important issue during group discussion. It was decided upon by the group that this would be added as one of the health issues to be voted on in addition to the 13 issues presented. Additionally, council members were informed that they could combine any issues they felt were appropriate. For example, council members could vote for mental health or they could combine mental health and substan ce abuse and vote for behavioral health. Discussion also occurred during the meeting that diabetes, cancer and heart disease could all fall under obesity if selected as one of the six priorities for voting, because reducing obesity could positively impact the incidence of each of the se diseases. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 20 After council members voted, the results of the top six issues prioritized at the next meeting were as follows: Access to Appropriate Care for the Underserved and Areas of High Socioeconomic Needs Behavioral Health (Mental Health and Substance Abuse) Birth Outcomes Obesity Oral Health Respiratory Disease . The Hanlon Method was utilized during the prioritization meeting to select the top three health priorities for McLean County. The following three health p riorities were selected by the McLean County Community Health Council for the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment : Access to Appropriate Health care for the Underserved and Areas of High Socioeconomic Need Access to appropriate care for th e underserved and areas of high socioeconomic need was selected as a health priority by the McLean County Community Health Council not only because of its high priority score (158.6) derived from the Hanlon Method , but for several other reasons. Access to appropriate care is an important issue that affects many health outcomes. Improving access in specific areas and for targeted populations can have a widespread impact on a variety of health outcomes ranging from oral health to behavioral health. Data prese nted to the council also indicated that there are significant geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in McLean County that may be related to access to care. Research and subject matter expertise suggested that there are a variety of factors that can impr ove access to appropriate care ranging from increased capacity for urgent care clinics and primary care offices, transportation , and provider and consumer e ducation . Behavioral Health (including Mental Health and Substance Abuse ) Behavioral health was selected as a health priority by the McLean County Community Health Council for several reasons. Behavioral health received the highest priority score (175.7) from the Hanlon Method, clearly indicating the need for further improvement s in this area in McLean County. In addition, there are numerous heal th disparities in Bloomington ZIP code 61701 and Normal ZIP code 61761 for both mental health and substance abuse. There was also a great deal of public support and momentum to improve mental health in McLean County as has been the case for the last few years. McLean County was well situated to collaborate on mental health due to the ongoing efforts of numerous organizations and the development of the McLean County Mental Health Action Pla n by the McLean County Board in 2015 . Mental health was also previously selected as a key health priority by both hospitals and the health department during the previous community health needs assessments, giving further momentum to the efforts of improvin g mental health for county residents. Obesity Obesity was selected as one of the three top health priorities by the McLean County Community Health Council because it ranked as number three according to its priority score of 153.8 from the Hanlon Method. Additionally, the council felt that by improving obesity, many other health outcomes such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes may also be positively impacted. It was also selected because obesity 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 21 is a widespread issue affecting many people across all soci al and economic sectors . There are also many significant community efforts underway related to obesity through the McLean County Wellness Coalition. The health department and both ho spitals are part of the McLean County Wellness Coalition , as are 28 other community organizations in McLean County. The McLean County Wellness Coalition is the primary group working on the interventions outlined in the 2017 - 2019 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan. The three significant health issues that will no t be addressed in the 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan are birth outcomes, oral health and respiratory disease. The council acknowledged the importance of all three of these issues, but the prioritization scores for the three se lected issues were higher than those for the issues that will not be addressed . e) Summary of 2017 - 2019 Community Health Improvement Plan Key Accomplishments After identification of the top three health priorities, the next step in the process included p ulling key stakeholders together to set high level goals for each health priority. A separate meeting was held for each health priority, during the month of April 2016, to discuss appropriate community goals for each initiative. The goals for each of the h ealth priorities identified and accomplishments for 2017 and/or 2018 are listed below and a chart that easily identifies each organization's particular role and actions is provided in Appendix 1.

A comprehensive list of secondary data sou rces can be found in Appendix 3. Primary Data In addition to existing secondary data sources, primary survey data were also collected. See Appendix 4 to view the survey. This section describes the research methods used to collect, code, verify and analyze primary survey data. Specifically, the resear ch design used for this study includes : survey design, data collection and data integrity as outlined below . Survey Development Initially, all publicly available health needs assessments in the U nited States were assessed to identify common themes and approaches to collecting community health needs data. By leveraging best practices from these surveys, in 2018 a pilot survey was designed for use with both the general populati on and the at -risk community. To ensure that all critical areas were being addr essed, a collaborative team was involved in survey design and approval through several fact -finding sessions. Additionally, several focus groups were used to collect the qualitative information necessary to design survey items. Eight specific sets of items were included in the community health survey : 1) Ratings of health issues in the community to assess the importance of various community health concerns. Survey items included assessments of topics such as cancer, diabetes and o besity. 2) Ratings of unhealthy behaviors in the community to assess the importance of various unhealthy behaviors. Survey items included assessments of topics such as violence, drug abuse and smoking. 3) Ratings of issues concerning well -being to assess the importance of various issues relat ed to well - being in the community. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to healthcare, safer neighborhoods and effective public transportation. 4) Accessibility to healthcare to assess t he degree to which residents could access healthcare when needed. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to medical, dental and mental healthcare , as well as access to prescription medications. 5) Healthy behaviors to assess the degree to which residents exhibit ed healthy behaviors. The survey items included assessments of topics such as exercise, healthy eating habits and cancer screenings. 6) Behavioral health to assess community issues related to areas such as anxiety and depression. 7) Food security to assess access to healthy food alternatives. 8) Social determinants of health to assess the impact that social determinants may have on the above - mentioned areas . Demographic information was collected to assess background information necessary to segment markets in terms of the eight categories discussed above. Sample Size To provide a representative profile when assessing the aggregated population for McLean County , the general population was combined with a portion of the at -risk population. To represent the at -risk population as a percentage of the aggregate population, a random -number generator was used to select at-risk cases to include in the general sample. Additionally, efforts were made to ensure that the 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 28 demography of the sample was a ligned with population demographics according to U.S. Census data. This provided a total usable sample of 695 respondents for analyzing the aggregate population. Data Collection To collect data in this study, two techniques were used. First, an online v ersion of the survey was created. Second, a paper version of the survey was distributed. To be sensitive to the needs of respondents, surveys stressed assurance of complete anonymity. Versions of both the online survey and paper survey were translated into Spanish and were collected from July 2018 - September 2018. See Appendix 4 for the survey instrument . In addition to defining the community by geographic boundaries, this study target ed the at -risk population as an area of potential opportunity to impr ove the health of the community. Note that the at-risk population was defined as those individuals who are members of medically underserved, low - income, and minority populations in McLean County. To specifically target the at -risk population, surveys were distributed at homeless shelters, food pant ries and soup kitchens. This became a stratified sample since there was no effort to specifically target other groups based on their socio -economic status. Comparisons with 201 5 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Throughout the report, the 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey is compared to the 201 5 McLean County Community Health Survey. b) Community Description The McLean County Community Health Council defined the community as McLean County, the primary service area for Advocate BroMenn Medical Center , the McLean County Health Department, OSF St. Joseph Medical Center and Chestnut Family Health Center . This area includes t he following cities and McLean, Merna, Normal, Saybrook, Stanford and Towanda. See Exhibit 2 below for a map of McLean County. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 29 Exhibit 2: McLean County Community Map Source: McLean County Regional Planning Commission, 2016 . Population McLean County consists of a total population of 172,052 (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Claritas, 2019). Bloomington has the largest population in the county with 78,368 and Normal has the second largest population with 5 4,534 (Bloomington -Normal Economic Development Council, 2018) . The population i n McLean County increased by 1.46 percent from 2010 to 201 9 (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute , Claritas, 201 9). Social Determinants of Health: SocioNeeds The SocioNeeds Index is a Conduent Healthy Communities Institute tool that is a measure of socioeconomic need, which is correlated with poor health outcomes. The index is calculated from six indicators, one each from the fo llowing topics: poverty, income, unemployment, occupation, education and language. The indicators are weighted to maximize the correlation of the index with premature death rates and preventable hospitalization rates. All ZIP codes, counties, and county equivalents in the United States are given an index value from 0 (low need) to 100 (high need). To help identify the areas of highest need within a defined geographic area, the selected ZIP codes are ranked from 1 (low need) to 5 (high need) based on their i ndex value. These values are sorted from low to high and divided into five ranks using natural breaks. These ranks are then used to color the ZIP codes with the highest SocioNeeds rankings with the darker colors. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 30 McLean County has several communities that have greater socioeconomic needs compared to other communities in the county . The SocioNeeds map for McLean County is illustrated in Exhibit 3. McLean County has one ZIP code with a ranking of 5 and eight ZIP codes with a ranking of 4, which represents the area s with the highest soci oeconomic need in McLean County.

While it is important for each county to identify its own highest scoring ZIP codes , it is also important to compare McLean County to other counties in the U nited States . For example , the ZIP codes with the highest index values in McLean County do not exce ed 4 6.5, which is half the value of many ZIP codes on the west and south sides o f Chicago. In other words, McLean County's worst scoring ZIP code is still in the top or best 0 - 50th percentile compared to all ZIP codes in the United States .

Exhibit 23: Causes of Inability to Access Medical Care for McLean County Survey Respondents , 2018 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2018 . Access to Prescriptions The top two reasons for not being able to access prescription care were due to not being able to afford the co -pay and having no insurance. See Exhibit 24 below.

Related to access to dental care, in McLean County there are 65 dentists per 100,000 population. This ratio is worse than the Illinois ratio (75 dentists/100,000 population) but better than the prior value for McLean County (64 dentists/100,000 population) and is trending favorably in a statistically significant direction (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, 2016). A national analysis of Medical Expenditure Survey Data (2000 - 2015), conducted by the American Dental Association's Health Policy Institute, noted that the majority of people in the survey had not visited a dentist in the past 12 months (American Dental A ssociation, Dental Care Utilization in the U.S. Infographic utilizing Health Policy Institute data, 2015): Children (ages 2 -18): 48.5 percent visited a general dentist; 51.5 percent did not Adults (ages 19 -64): 36 percent visited a general dentist; 64 p ercent did not Seniors (ages 65 and above): 43.7 percent visited a general dentist; 56.3 percent did not. According to the United Way of McLean County's 2014 Community Needs Assessment, 39.1 percent of McLean County residents are without dental insurance . Medicare does not cover most dental services, including dental care such as cleanings and dental procedures such as fillings, extraction of teeth, dentures, dental plates or devices. Specific dental services may be covered if hospitalized under Medicare Part A (hospital insurance). It may also pay for inpatient hospital care for complicated dental procedures, but it will not pay for the dental care itself. In general, individuals with Medicare insurance need to expect to pay for most dental care out of po cket (United States Medicare Program, 2019). In Illinois, the Medicaid program is administered by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services. For children (under age 21), Medicaid coverage for dental services is extensive, covering services such as oral exam, cleanings, fluoride treatment, sealants, fillings, root canals, gum disease treatment and extractions. For adults (over age 20), Medicaid coverage was minimal until some services were restored on July 1, 2014, through Public Act 98 -0651. Medicaid covers exams, extractions, x -rays and some restorative services for adults, but it does not cover most preventive oral health services, although some Medicaid managed care plans will cover at least one cleaning per year for adults and pregnant wo men (Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, Dental Program, Need Help Finding a Dentist?, 2019). Medicaid reimbursement continues to be low overall; therefore, a limited number of private practices accept Medicaid as payment ( American Denta l Association's Health Policy 0%20%40%60%46% 35% 15% 5%No Insurance Could Not Afford Co-Pay Doctor Refused Insurance No Way to Get to Doctor 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 49 Institute, \"Are Medicaid and Private Dental Insurance Payment Rates for Pediatric Dental Care Services Keeping up with Inflation,\" 2014). In McLean County, access to dental care for children and adults with Medicaid insuranc e has been steadily imp roving since 2014. In addition to the adult and child dental clinics at the McLean County Health Department, several corporate practices have opened in the Bloomington/Normal area that accept Medicaid . In addition, the Community Heal th Care Clinic in early 2019 began to provide dental care to its clients, wh o are not eligible for Medicaid. Access to Counseling Exhibit 26 below illustrates reasons survey respondents were not able to get counseling when needed. Like the above reasons for not being able to access care, respondents reported as the top reason that they could not afford the co -pay; however, unlike the above responses, embarrassment was reported as the second reason for not accessing counseling. Exhibit 26: Causes of Inability to Access Counseling for McLean County Survey Respondents , 2018 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2018 . Comparison to the 201 5 McLean County Community Health Survey Access to medical servi ces and access to prescription medication improved since 201 5, however, there were more survey respondents who lacked access to counseling due to their inability to afford the co - pay (31 percent in 201 5 and 36 percent in 2018) and more felt embarrassed to have counseling (16 percent in 201 5 and 22 percent in 2018). Access to dental services was similar as there were more respondents who could not afford a dental visit due to not having insurance (45 percent without insurance in 201 5 and 46 percent in 2018) . Also, an increased number of respondents couldn't afford the co -pay amount (30 percent in 201 5 and 35 percent in 2018). Healthc are Coverage Seventy -four million people were enrolled in Medicaid in 2017; this equates to 19.3 percent of the US population. In Illinois, 12.6 million people (18 percent ) use Medicaid as their primary medical coverage. Additionally, 29,639 McLean County residents are enrolled in Medicare ( Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and Illinois Department of Healthc are and Family Services, 2017 ). 0%10%20%30%40%36% 22%21% 12%9%Could Not Afford Co-Pay Embarrassment No Insurance No Way to Get to Doctor Doctor Refused Insurance 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 50 One-hundred -and-one percent of respondents of the 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey reported having either private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid , while ten percent reported not having any insurance. This percenta ge is greater than 100 percent because respondents could choose more than one answer (e.g. , private insurance and Medicare). Exhibit 27 shows the breakdown. Having Medicare tends to be used more frequently by older people and those wi th lower education and income. Medicaid tends to be used more frequently by men, younger people, Black s or African Americans, those with lower education and income and those with an unstable (e.g. , homeless) housing environment. Having Medicaid tends to be rated lower by White s. Having p rivate i nsurance is used more often by women, White s and those with higher education and income. Private insurance tends to be rated lower by Black s or African Americans and those with an unstable (e.g. , homeless) housing environment. Not having i nsurance tends to be reported more often by Black s or African Americans and those with an unstable (e.g. , homeless) housing environment (McLean County Community Health Survey , 2018 ). Exhibit 27: Types of Insurance Coverage for McLean County Survey Respondents , 2018 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2018 . Comparison to the 201 5 McLean County Community Health Survey Compared to the 201 5 McLean County Community Health Survey, 91 percent of th e respondents reported having either private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, while eight percent reported having no insurance. Key Findings : Access to Care Compared to the 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey: o There was a modest increase i n use of clinic/doctor's office and urgent ca re usage for the general population in 2018 . The at -risk population showed an increase in the urgent care usage as well as emergency room usage. Both populations decreased the amount of people who don't seek medical c are when needed. 74%11%16%10% Private Medicaid Medicare None 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 51 o There was an increase of those individuals who have a personal physician (80 percent in 2015 to 89 percent in 2018). o There has been an increase in the percent of survey respondents that have private insurance . o The percentage of survey resp ondents who needed medical, dental, counseling or prescription medication , but did not receive care , decreased or stayed the same from 2015 to 2018 . Emergency room tends to be selected as a response for \"choice of medical care\" more often by people with the following characteristics: less educated, have lower incomes and have an unstable housing environment . Access to medical care, prescription medications and dental care tends to be higher for Whites, those with higher education and income levels and those living in a stable housing environment. Access to counselling tends to be rated higher by older people and those with a higher income. e) Nutrition, Weight and Exercise Nutrition 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey The 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey data show that 55 percent of McLean County residents report no consumption or low consumption ( one to two servings per day) of fruits and vegetables (see Exhibit 28). Frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption tends to be higher b y Whites and those with higher education and income. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 52 Exhibit 28: Responses for \"On a typical day, how many servings of fruits and/or vegetables do you eat?\" for McLean County Survey Respondents , 2018 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2018 . For the 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey respondents who indicated not eating fruits or vegetables, the inability to afford fruits and vegetables and not liking them were the two most frequently cited reasons for f ailing to consume fruits and vegetables .

Comparison to the 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey data show an improvement in adult consumption of three or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day , from 40 perce nt in 2015 to 45 percent in 2018. According to the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 13.7 percent of McLean County adults consu me five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day , fewer than the national rate of 23.4 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Systems, 2007 - 2009 ). An average of nine percent of eighth, tenth and twel fth graders eat four or more fruits per day and seven percent eat four or more vegetables per day (Illinois Youth Survey, 201 8). Weight Status Adults Approximately 32 percent of McLean County residents are classified as obese. McLean County's obesity rate is higher than the state at 31.6 percent and the n ational rate at 29.9 percent. It also does not meet the Healthy People 2020 target of 30.5 percent. As shown in Exhibit 30, the obesity rate in McLean County has increased by 11.4 percent from 2004 - 2006 to 2010 - 2014 (Conduent Healthy Communities, Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2010 - 2014 ). 02468101211 9 6 22 1 0Why Don't You Eat Fruits and Vegetables -McLean County 2019 Cannot afford I don't like Not important Transportation No refridgerator/stove Cannot prepare Don't know where to buy 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 54 Exhibit 30: McLean County's Obesity Trend , 2010 - 2014 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute , Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2010 - 2014 .

This rate is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) when compared to other counties in Illinois but higher than the Illinois value of 2 1.5 percent . The McLean County percent is trending unfavorably but is not statistically significant and meets the Healthy People 2020 target of 32.6 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Inst itute, County Health Rankings, 201 5).

Exhibit 32: Adults 20+ who are Sedentary, McLean County , 2008 - 2015 McLean County 23.5 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, 201 5. According to the 2018 Illinois Youth Survey , an average of 22 percent of McLean County eighth, tenth and twelfth graders were physically active for at least 60 minutes for five days during the past seven days . In 2018, t he average percent age of McLean County eighth, tenth and twelfth graders watching less than one hour of TV on school days was 21 percent. 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey Results fro m the 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey show that 20 percent of respondents indicated that they do not exercise at all, while 80 percent exercise one to two time s per week or more .

Key findings: Nutrition, Weight and Exercise Fewer McLean County adults consume five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day than the national rate. McLean County's obesity rate is higher than the state and national rates . The percentage of McLean County adu lts (ages 20 and up) who did not participate in any leisure - time activities (physical activities other than their regular job) during the past month is 24 percent. f) Social Determinants of Health Built Environment Physical Activity According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, \"t he built environment describes physical or manmade features such as sidewalks, streetlights, traffic and parks that may promote or discourage activity. \" The built environment is important to consider when assessing physica l activity as there is strong evidence suggesting an association between access to recreational resources, bikability and walkability of neighborhoods as well as safe, esthetically pleasing environments with increased physical activity and reduced obesity rates (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Built Environment and Physical Activity, 2007). In McLean County, 83.6 percent of residents have access to exercise opportunities, meaning they live reasonably close to a park or recreational facility. McLean County falls in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) when compared to other counties in Illinois for access to exercise opportunities despite the county's rural expanse. It is lower than the Illinois value of 91.3 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, 2018). According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Env ironment Atlas, 2014, there are 0.11 recreation and fitness centers per 1,000 population in McLean County, slightly more than the national average of 0.06 per 1,000 population . Nationally, only 0.4 percent of the American population commutes to work by bi cycle (U.S. Census Bureau Survey of Communities, 2013 -2017). According to a survey conducted by the McLean County Regional Planning Commission in 2016, eight percent of respondents indicated using a bicycle as their mode of transportation for location -base d trips. Respondents noted they would ride their bicycle more often if they felt safer on the streets, there were more on -road bike lanes , shared lane markings and more off -road trails. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 58 Food Security and Access to Healthy Foods Food Environment Index The food environment index combines two measures of food access: the percentage of the population that is low -income and has low access to a grocery store, and the percentage of the population that did not have access to a reliable source of food during the past year (food insecurity). The index ranges from 0 (worst) to 10 (best) and equally weights the two measures . The food environment index for McLean County is 7.6 which is in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois . It is worse than the Illinois index of 8.7 but better than the prior value for McLean County in 2017 of 7.5. The index for McLean County is trending unfavorably but is not statistically significant. (Conduent Healthy Communities Insti tute, County Health Rankings, 2018). See Exhibit 35 below. Exhibit 35: Food Environment Index for McLean County , 2014 - 2018 McLean County 7.6 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, 2018 . Food Insecurity The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines food insecurity as limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods or uncertain ability to acquire these foods in socially acceptable ways. The percentag e of the population that experienced food insecurity in McLean County at some point during 2016 is 12.1 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Feeding America, 2016) . This rate is in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range ( yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois and higher than the Illinois rate of 11 percent. It is , however, lower than the prior value for McLean County (2015) and is trending favorably albeit not statistically significant. See Exhibit 36 below for an illustration of the data stated above. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 59 Exhibit 36: Food Insecurity Rate in McLean County , 2011 - 2016 McLean County 12.1% Source: Conduent Healthy Communities, Feeding America, 2016. The percentage of children (under 18 years of age) living in households that experienced food insecurity at some point during 201 6 is 14.1 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Feeding America, 2016). This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator ) compared to other counties in Illinois , lower than the Illinois value of 15.7 percent and lower than the 2015 value of 15.1 percent. The percent of food insecure children in households with incomes above 185 percent of the federal poverty level who are likely not income -eligible for federal nutrition assistance in McLean County is 37 percent. This is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois and higher than the state value of 32 percent. It is , howeve r, lower than the McLean County 2015 value of 39 percent and over time is trending favorably in a statistically significant direction (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Feeding America, 2016). See Exhibit 37 below for an illustration of this data.

FY 2018 Mid Central Community Action Survey According to the Mid Central Community Action's FY18 Community Needs Assessment results for McLean County residents, 16.9 percent of survey respondents (n = 1,711) responded that they could use help with getting food from food pantries of food banks. Most of the survey respondents were customers of Mid Central Community Action who went to the center to receive low-income home energy assistance (LIHEAP). Approximately 12 percent of survey respondents indica ted that they could use help with having enough food at home. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 60 Grocery Store Density McLean County falls in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois for grocery store density with 0.16 supermar kets and grocery stores per 1,000 population (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food Environment Atlas, 2014). This is lower than the 2012 value for McLean County of 0.20 stores per 1,000 population. See Exhibit 38 below. Exhibit 38: McLean County Grocery Store Density , 2012 - 2014 McLean County 0.16 Stores / 1,000 population Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, U.S. Department of Agriculture -Food Environment Atlas, 2014.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Certified Stores SNAP, previously called the Food Stamp Program, is a federal assistance program that provides low - income families with electronic benefit transfers (EBTs) that can be used to purchase food. The purpose of the program is to assist low -income households in obtaining adequate and nutritious diets. According to the program, over 45 million people from over 20 million households receive SNAP benefits (Conduent Healthy Communities, 2019). There are 0.7 stores/1,000 population in McLean County that are certified to accept SNAP benefits .

This is in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois . This is better than the Illinois value of 18.4 percent, slightly higher than the prior value for McLean County of 12.8 percent and is trending unfavorably but is not statistically significant (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Ranking s, 2011 - 2015). See Exhibit 42 below . Exhibit 42: Severe Housing Problems in McLean County , 2011 - 2015 McLean County 13.2% Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, 2010 - 2014 . Homeownership The percentage of all housing units that are occupied by homeowners in McLean County is 59.7 percent. This is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois . It is approximately equal to both the st ate and prior value for McLean County . It is trending unfavorably in a statistically significant direction (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, American Community Survey, 2013 -2017). In addition to McLean County , two of the high SocioNeeds ZIP codes are also in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) for homeownership, compared to other ZIP codes in Illinois. The indicators are illustrated in Exhibit 43 shown below . 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 64 Exhibit 43: Homeownership for McLean County and High SocioNeeds ZIP Codes , 2013 - 2017 McLean County 61761 59.7% 46.9% 51.2% Source: Conduent Institute, American Community Survey, 2013 - 2017 . Housing Affordability Spending a high percentage of household income on rent can create financial hardship, especially for lower -income renters. With a limited income, paying a high rent may not leave enough money for other expenses, such as food, transportation and medical care. Moreover, high rent reduces the proportion of income a household can allocate to savings each month (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, 2019). In McLean County, 44.4 percent of renters are spending 30 percent or more of their income on housing or rent. This is in the wor st 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois . Compared to other ZIP codes in Illinois, one high SocioNeeds ZIP code , Normal ZIP code 61761 , is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) . Two high SocioNeeds ZIP codes, Bloomin gton ZIP code 61701 and Colfax ZIP code 61728 , are in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, American Community Survey, 2013 -2017). See Exhibit 44 below for an illustration of this information. Exhibit 44: Percent of Income Spent on Rent in McLean County , 2013 - 2017 McLean County Bloomington - Survey, 2013 - 2017 . FY 2018 Mid Central Community Action Survey According to the Mid Central Community Action's FY18 Community Needs Assessment results for McLean County residents, 15.6 percent of survey respondents (n = 1,711) responded that they could use help with getting financial assistance with rent or mortgage payments. Most of the survey respondents were customers of Mid Central Community Action who went to the center to receive low-income home energy assistance (LIHEAP). Approximately 13 percent of survey respondents indicated that they could use help finding affordable housing that fits their family's needs. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 65 Housing and Living Arrangements According to the 2018 McLean County Co mmunity Health Survey, 85 percent of survey respondents reported that they have housing and are not worried about losing it.

FY 2018 Mid Central Community Action Survey According to the Mid Central Community Action's FY18 Community Needs Assessment results for McLean County residents, survey respondents (n = 1,711) responded that they could use financial assistance for the following expenses related to transportation: 16.0 percent - car repairs 13.4 percent - to buy a dependable car 10.2 percent - to buy car insurance 8.9 percent - to pay car registration or license fees 8.8 percent - to have dependable transportation to and from work . Public Safety Violent Crime Rate Violent crimes include murder and non -negligent manslaughter , rape, robbery and aggravated assault . The violent crime rate in McLean County over time has decreased. See Exhibit 46 below for an illustration of this statistically significant trend (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, Uniform Crime Reporting - FBI, 20 07 - 2016). Exhibit 46: Trend for Violent Crime Rate in McLean County , 2007 - 2016 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, Uniform Crime Reporting - FBI, 2007 - 2016.

Exhibit 49: Alcohol -Impaired Driving Deaths in McLean County , 2008 - 2016 McLean County 37.1% Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, 2012 - 2016 . Falls Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among older adults. In addition, they are also the most common cause of nonfatal injuries and hospital admissions for trauma. In the United States, more than one third of adults ages 65 and older fall each year. Twenty to thirty percent of older adults who fall suffer moderate to severe injuries. Fall -related injuries include bruises, hip fractures and head traumas. These types of injuries can increase the risk of early death and can make it difficult for older a dults to live independently (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, 2019). Each week in Illinois, there are 1,923 emergency room visits among residents ages 65 and older, resulting in 213 hospitalizations and 16 deaths due to fall injuries (Illinois Depar tment of Public Health, data released January 2017 for 2008 - 2014). Age-Adjusted Emergency Room Rate due to Unintentional Falls The age -adjusted emergency room rate due to unintentional falls in McLean County is 203.7 emergency room visits per 10,000 po pulation ages 18 years and older. This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2015 - 2017 ). Age-Adjusted Hospitalizatio n Rate due to Unintentional Falls The age -adjusted hospitalization rate due to unintentional falls in McLean County is 39 hospitalizations per 10,000 population ages 18 years and older. This is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 69 in compari son to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2015 - 2017 ). See Exhibit 50 below.

In Illinois, older adults who reported the following conditions were significantly more likely to report falls and fall -related injuries in the past 12 months: poor mental health/depression , cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , diabetes , coronary artery disease , obesity , asthma , no exercise, stroke and disability (Illinois Department of Public Health, data released January 2017 for 2008 - 2014). The Matter of Balance Program hosted locally by Community Care Systems, Inc., is a grant -funded evidence -based program designed to reduce fear of falling and increase acti vity levels in older adults who are concerned about falling. Participant satisfaction results from those completing the 8 -week program (data from all host sites) include: 96 percent feel more satisfied with life; 97 percent feel more comfortable increasin g activity and 99 percent plan to continue to exercise (Matter of Balance Program statistics, Rush University, Chicago, 2019) . School Safety /Climate Results from the 2018 Illinois Youth Survey show that an average of approximately six percent of eighth, tenth and twelfth graders in McLean County strongly disagree or disagree with the statement, \"I feel safe at my school \".

Social /Family Environment Adverse Childhood Experiences Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) is the term used to describe all types of abuse, neglect and other potentially traumatic experiences that occur to people under the age of 18. ACEs include: Physical abuse Sexual abuse Emotional abuse or neglect Physical neglect Intimate partner violence Mother treated violently Substance misuse within household 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 71 Household mental illness Parental separation or divorce Incarcerated household member . Adverse Childhood Experiences have been linked to : risky health behaviors chronic health conditions low life potential early death . As the number of ACEs increases, so does the risk for these outcomes (Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention, 2019). https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childabuseandneglect/acestudy/aboutace.html . Exhibit 53 below illustrates ACE's data for Illinois. According to the res ults, almost 60 percent of non - institutionalized adults say they had at least one ACE (Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Illinois Department of Public Health, 2013) .

Child Abuse and Neglect McLean County's substantiated child abuse rate (number of children under the age of 18 that experienced abuse or neglect) is 10.8 cases per 1,000 children (2015) . This rate is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) when compared to other counties in Illinois but is higher than the Illinois rate of 9.7 cases per 1,000 children and higher than the McLean County 2014 value of 9.4 cases per 1,000 chil dren. The rate for McLean County is trending in a favorable direction but is not statistically significant (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, 2015). See Exhibit 54 below. Exhibit 54: Substantiated Child Abuse Rate in McLean County , 2011 - 2015 McLean County 10.8 cases / 1,000 children Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, 2015 . On November 30, 2018, 205 McLean County children were in state custody under 26 HealthWorks eligible living arrangements with the Illinois Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS) . The number, which changes daily, has been decreasing after a peak of over 300 children in care was experienced in 2012. County -specific numbers are not available for the children in state custody who are in the 23 non -HealthWorks eligible living arrangements. (I llinois Department of Children and Family Serv ices, Monthly Data Reports , https://www2.illinois.gov/dcfs/aboutus/newsandreports/reports/Pages/default.aspx ). Of the 164 McLean County children in care during the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2018 (April - June 2018), 89 percent were current with their immunizations (I llinois : 88.7 percent ); 87.8 percent were current with their Early and Periodic Screening, Diagn ostic and Treatment (EPSDT) visits (I llinois : 86.2 percent ); and, 98.2 percent had a Primary Care Physician (PCP) (I llinois : 99.1 percent ). (Source: DCFS Monthly Report to HealthWorks Lead Agency, McLean County, November 2018). 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 74 Physical Environment - Air, Water, Radon, Lead and Hazardous Waste Air Poor air quality can exacerbate existing conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Outdoor Air, 2019) . The American Lung Association assigns grades A -F to counties (A=1; B=2; C=3; D=4; F=5), based on the average annual number of days that ozone levels exceeded U.S. standards during a three -year measurement period. For the measurement period of 201 4 - 2016, McLean County received a B grade for its annual ozone air quality . This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois and is an improvement from the D grade received in 2011 - 2013 (Conduent Healthy Communities I nstitute, American Lung Association, 2014 - 2016). Using the same scale, McLean County received a B rating for the average number of days particle air pollution exceeded U.S. standards for the measurement period of 2010 - 2012 . This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, American Lung Association, 2010 - 2012). See Exhibit 55 for an illustration of this data. Exhibit 55: McLean County Annual Ozone Air Quality , 2014 - 2016 and Particle Pollution , 2010 - 2012 Annual Ozone Air Quality Particle Pollution Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, American Lung Association, 2014 - 2016 and 2010 - 2012. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2017 , eight pounds of recognized carcinogens were released into the air in McLean County . This is an improvement from the prior value of 3,656 pounds in 2014 (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2016 ). The Air Quality Index , which reports air quality using a value from 0 to 500, is the national standard method for reporting air pollution levels to the pu blic. As the Air Quality Index rises, the leve l of health concern increases: Good ( 0-50), Moderate (51 -100), Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101 -150), Unhealthy (151 -200), Very Unhealthy (201 -300), and Hazardous (301 -500). In general, an Air Quality Index rating of \"Good\" or \"Moderate\" will meet or exceed the Healthy People 2020 objective to not exceed a score of 100 on any given day. The Air Quality Index is based on the federal National Ambient Air Quality Standards for the pollutants that serve as the ma in indices of air quality, including : sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter , nitrogen oxide s and volatile organic compounds (which contribute to the creation of harmful ground -level ozone) . Monitoring stations for various pollutants are locat ed throughout Illinois, including central Illinois. The statistics for the latest 2017 Air Quality Index shows the sector representing Normal, Illinois was rated as \"Good\" 78.3 percent and \"Moderate\" 21.7 percent for the year, meeting the Healthy People 2020 objective. No noticeable trend toward an Air Quality Index designation of \"Unhealthy for Sensitive 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 75 Groups\" or beyond was noted for McLean County in the five -year period 2013 - 2017 (Environmental Protection Agency, Air Data, Air Quality Monitors Data, 2018). Exhibit 56 below provides an overview of the percent of days in Normal, I llinois that air quality was \"Good\" or \"Moderate\" in comparison to Peoria and Champaign during the five-year period of 2013 - 2017. Exhibit 56: Air Quality Index Results from 2013 - 2017 Percent of Days Air Quality \"Good\" or \"Moderate\" Sources: United States Environmenta l Protection Agency, Air Data: Air Quality Data Collected at Outdoor Monitors Across the U nited States , 2018; https://www.epa.gov/outdoor -air-quality -data ; United States Environmental Protection Agency, Outdoor Air Quality Data, Interactive Map of Air Quality Monitors, accessed 2018 for data 2013 - 2017; Champaign 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 76 Water The percentage of people who get water from public water systems that have received at least one health -based violation in the FY 2013 - 2014 reporting period is 2.4 percent. This is in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois and is higher than the Illinois value of 1.8 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, FY 2013 - 2014 ). See Exhibit 57 below. Exhibit 57: McLean County Drinking Water Violations , FY2013 - 2014 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, FY 2013 - 2014 . Private water wells are to be tested for Total Coliform/E -coli as an intervention to protect health. Water well samples acquired by the McLean County Health Department are shipped to the Illinois Department of Public Health in Springfield for testing. Any results that are greater than 1 ppm/100ml are in violation and a re -sample is needed. It is possible that one well on a property may have multiple violations because samples are taken until compliance is obtained. In 2017, there were a total of 89 properti es (parcels) which had private water wells sampled. Of these, 51 (57 percent) had a violation (McLean County Health Department, Environmental Health Division, 2018). Lead in drinking water can cause serious health problems, particularly for children and pregnant women. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (http://www.epa.gov/sdwa ) requires municipalities to test for lead and other contaminants in municipal water supplies. Lead in water is tested at each municipality 's water treatment plant. The action level (concentration of a contaminant that triggers treatment or other required actions) for lead is 15 parts per billion ( ppb). Both the City of Bloomington and the Town of Normal publish annual water quality reports. The reports referencing water samples obtained in 2017 indicate that both municipal water supplies complied for lead levels in 2017 ( City of Bloomington , Illinois 2017 Annual Consumer Report on the Quality of Tap Water ; Town of Normal Illinois , Town of Normal Water Department , 2019 Annual Water Quality Report ). Fluoridation of community water supplies is another way to protect and promote health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors the fluoride level of community water supplies. To protect the dental health of all citizens, community water supplies are required to adjust the fluoride level to between 0.9 - 1.2 milligrams per liter (415 Ill. Compiled Statute, Act 40/7a). In Illinois, the percent of people served by fluoridated communi ty water systems has increased, from 95.2 percent in 1992 to 98.5 percent in 2014 (Fluoride Action Network, 2019). Of the 34 water systems in McLean County found in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database, 30 (88 percent) had fluoridated wa ter supplies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Oral Health, My Water's Fluoride, 2018). In 2018, less than one percent (800 out of 151,981 residents) of McLean County residents on a community water supply 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 77 receives water that does not meet the cu rrent standards for optimally fluoridated water (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Oral Health, My Water's Fluoride, 2018). McLean County exceeds the Healthy People 2020 goal of \"increasing the proportion of the U.S. population served by communit y water systems with optimally fluoridated water to 79.6 percent ,\" with 99 percent of its population receiving optimally fluoridated water. Radon Radon is a radioactive gas that forms as radioactive metals break down in soil, rocks and groundwater. It is the second leading cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). Approximately one home in 15 in the United States has elevated radon levels, which is a radon concentration above 4 picocuries per liter o f air (pCi/L) (United States Environmental Protection Agency, A Citizen's Guide to Radon, 2012). McLean County has been designated a Zone 1 county by the U.S. En vironmental Protection Agency; these counties have the highest potential for indoor radon screening levels greater than 4 pCi/L . Fifty -six counties out of 102 in Illinois have been designated as Zone 1 (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2018). Radon levels across McLean County are variable, ranging from a low of 0 to a high of 12.3 pCi/L. Measurements by ZIP code are available (Illinois Emergency Management Agency, Radon in Illinois, Interactive Map, 2019). In 2014, the average indoor radon level for homes in McLean County was 5.7 pCi/L, higher than state (4.9 pCi/L) and national (1.3 pCi/L) levels. Half of McLean County homes tested for radon had levels above 4pCi/L (Illinois Emergency Management Agency, 2014). Radon testing is not required to buy or sell a home in Illinois; however, both the Illinois Radon Awareness Act and the Illinois Real Property Dislosure Act requires home sellers to disclose their knowledge regarding the presence or absence of radon in the home (Illinois Emergency Management Agency, Radon Testing Guidelines for Real Estate Transactions, 2007 ). Lead -based Paint There is no safe level of lead in the human body. Exposure to lead can pose serious health risks for children, including developmental delays, behavioral issues, learning disabilities and many other harmful health impacts (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2019 ). Over half of owner -occupied and rental units in Bloomington (53 percent) were built before 1980, and therefore have the potential to present lead -based paint hazards. Roughly 33 percent of units built before 1980 in Bloomington house children. Renters in Bloomington are more likely to be exposed to lead -based paint hazards as 60 percent of rental unit s were built before 1980 compared to 49 percent of owner -occupied units (City of Bloomington Consolidated Plan, 2015 - 2019). Lead testing provides opportunities for lead surveillance and early intervention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends monitoring children with blood lead levels of five micrograms per deciliter or higher; however, until January of 2019, the state of Illinois had set the monitoring level at 10 micrograms per deciliter or higher. It is now set at the C enters for Disease Control and Prevention l evel. Illinois laboratories are mandated to report adult lead test results of greater or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter to the Adult Blood Lead Registry (ABLR). In addition, a new Illinois law requires schools built 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 78 prior to January 1, 2000, to test the building's drinking water and submit the results to the Illinois Department of Public Health (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2019). In 2016, of the children ( ages 6 months to 5 years) tested at the McLean Count y Health Department, 3.1 percent had blood lead levels of five or higher (McLean County Health Department, Lead Program, 2018) . This is a nine percent increase from 2010. See Exhibit 58 below. Exhibit 58: Percentage of Children Tested with Blood Lead Levels Outside of Normal Limits, 2009 - 2016 Source: McLean County Health Department, 2018. The Illinois Lead Program 2017 Annual Surveillance Report provides a data summary for all McLean County children tested. New confirmed l ead cases identified for the first time in 2017 (based on all children tested) noted 1.0 case at greater or equal to 5 micrograms per deciliter and 0.5 cases at greater or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2019).

Municipal solid waste landfills are not equipped to handle these products and they can threaten the local environment when n ot disposed of properly. The Ecology Action Center in Normal, I llinois , has coordinated local collection events to meet th e disposal need. In past years, the Ecology Action Center partnered with the Illinois E nvironmental Protection Agency to fund collecti on events but as state funding diminished , locally funded collections have been necessary. The last Illinois Environmental Protection Agency event in McLean County was in 2013. The first locally funded collection occurred in 2012 with subsequent collection s in 2015 and 2017 (Ecology Action Center, 2018). Efforts to properly dispose of household hazardous waste have grown in McLean County since 1998. The three locally funded collection events (2012, 2015, 2017) yielded more waste collected (404 -498 fifty- five-gallon drums per event compared to 189 -376) and often a higher percentage of households participating (3.47 percent to 4.64 percent compared to 2.38 percent to 3.91 percent) when evaluated against all previous Illinois Environmental Protection Agency sponsored events. Through the four McLean County hazardous waste collection events between 2012 - 2017, 1,709 55 -gallon drums of household hazardous waste have been received, an increase of 55 percent compared to the first four collection events occurring from 1998 - 2005 when 1,101 55 -gallon drums were received (Ecology Action Center, 2018; Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, 2018).

It is a progressive and irreversible disease that impairs memory and affects thinking and behavior, to the point of eventually interfering with daily tasks. The greatest risk facto r currently known is increasing age. After age 65, the likelihood of developing the disease doubles every five years; the risk is nearly 50 percent after age 85. Alzheimer's imposes heavy emotional and financial burden on families. While there is current ly no cure, there are treatments that can slow the progression of Alzheimer's and improve the quality of life for people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019).

This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois , is lower than the Illinois value (9.3 percent) and not stati stically different from the prior value for McLean County (7.0 percent). The rate is trending favorably but not in a statistically significant direction (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, 2014 ). See Exhibit 78 below.

Infectious Disease Food Borne Illnesses and Other Pathogens E. Coli Nationally, children ages 1-4 years had the highest incidence of Escherichia coli (E. Coli) infection of all age groups for both the 0157 and non -0157 serogroups. The largest percentage of infections for both serogroups are reported in the summer months (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Shiga toxin -producing Escherichia coli [STEC ] Annual Survey , 2015 ). In McLean County between 2011 - 2015, case counts for all E. coli serotypes range from a low of one (2011) to a high of six (2013). The 2015 case count was five. In 2015, the E. coli incidence rate in McLean County was 2.95 cases per 100,000 population; however, it includes all E. coli serotypes. The Illinois (0.39) and national (0.66) rates are for the 0157 serotyp e only, both of which meet or exceed the Healthy People 2020 goal of 0.6 cases per 100,000 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Shiga toxin -producing Escherichia coli [STEC ] Annual Survey , 2015 ; Illinois Department of Public Health, IQuery , 2015 ). 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 99 Salmonella Each year, there are an estimated 1,400,000 cases of salmonellosis in the United States and 1,500 - 2,000 cases in Illinois (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2019). Case numbers in McLean County from 2014 -2016 for all Salmonella serotypes , have been 17 (2014), 11 (2015) and 23 (2016). As of 2018, the most current Salmonella incidence rate data available from the Illinois Department of Public Health is from 2010 - 2014 . The 2014 salmonella incidence rate in McLean County is 10 cases per 100,000 population, which is lower than the state rate (13.8), national rate (15.5) and Healthy People 2020 goal of 11.4 cases per 100,000. In 2012, McLean County experienced a spike in cases with an incidence rate of 39.5 per 100,000 but has otherwise rem ained relatively unchanged since 2010 (Illinois Department of Public Health, IQuery, 2014). See Exhibit 79 below. Exhibit 79: Salmonella Incidence Rate - McLean County , 2010 - 2014 Source: Illinois Department of Public Hea lth, IQuery, 2010 - 2014 . Tuberculosis In both 2017 and 2018 , there were two cases of tuberculosis in McLean County. This is higher than the 2014 prior value of one case and is trending unfavorably, but not in a statistically significant direction. In 2017, case rates per 100,000 were 1.15 in McLean County, 2.62 for Illinois and 2.8 for the United States. The National T uberculosis Program Objectives and Performance target for 2020 is no more than 1.4 cases per 100,000, the same target used by the Illi nois Department of Public Health. In 2018, the McLean County case rate remained at 1.15, still meeting the national target, while the Illinois rate moved to 2.48 per 100,000 (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 201 7; Illinois Department of Public Health, 2018; McLean County Health Department, Bloomington I llinois , 2019). 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 100 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Chlamydia In 2016, there were 511.1 cases of Chlamydia diagnosed per 100,000 population in McLean County. This rate is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois but is lower than the Illinois value (561.4 cases per 100 ,000 population) and lower than the prior value for McLean County (536 cases per 100,000 population). The rate is trending unfavorably in a statistically significant direction (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, National Center fo r HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention , 2016).

For 2017, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported a Chlamydia case rate of 569.7 per 100,000 for McLean County, with data for the years 2010 - 2017 continuing to demonstrate that this indicator is trending unfavorably. There has been an increase of 346 percent in the Chlamydia case rate from 2010 (127.6) to 2017 (569.7). In 2017, McLean County ranked in the top 15 counties in Illinois with the highest Chlamydia case rate per 100,000 (Illinois Department of Public Health, Sexually Transmitted Disea ses in Illinois : 2017 Epidemiologic Summary and Yearly Trends Data for 2008 - 2017 ). Disparities In Illinois in 2017: Chlamydia cases in females were 65.3 percent Those ages 15-24 years made up 64.1 percent of the cases reported in 2017 The state ranked 10th out of 50 states by Chlamydia rate The Black or African American, non -Hispanic population was disproportionately affected by Chlamydia infections, comprising approximately 40 percent of the total cases reported, with White, non -Hispanic following wit h 23.9 percent (Illinois Department of Public Health, Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Illinois : 2017 Epidemiologic Summary and Yearly Trends Data for 2008 - 2017 ).

This rate is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois. It is lower than the state rate of 164.8 cases per 100,000 population and higher than the prior value for McLean County (75.3 cases per 100,000 population). It is trending favorably, but not in a statistically significant direction (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention , 2016 ).

Since 201 0, McLean County's case rate has increased 11 percent from 113.2 to 126.2. In 2017, McLean County ranked in the top 21 counties in Illinois with the highest gonorrhea case rate per 100,000 (Illinois Department of Public Health, Sexually Transmitted Disease s in Illinois : 2017 Epidemiologic Summary and Yearly Trends Data for 2008 - 2017 ). Disparities In Illinois in 2017: Gonorrhea cases in males were 58.9 percent Those ages 15-29 years made up 72.3 percent of cases, with those ages 20-24 comprising 30 perc ent of total cases The state ranked 17th out of 50 states by gonorrhea rate The Black or African American, non -Hispanic population was disproportionately affected by gonorrhea infections, comprising approximately 56 percent of the total cases reported (Ill inois Department of Public Health, Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Illinois : 2017 Epidemiologic Summary and Yearly Trends Data for 2008 - 2017 ).

Syphilis In 2016, t here were 2.3 cases of primary and secondary syphilis per 100, 000 population in McLean County, which is below the 2016 Illinois rate (9.8 cases per 100,000). The rate is higher than the prior value for McLean County (1.1 case per 100,000 population) and is trending unfavorabl y but not in a statistically significant direction (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, National Center fo r HIV/AIDS, 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 103 Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Tuberculosis Prevention , 2016). The Illinois Department of Public Health reports 2 .4 cases of primary and secondary syphilis per 100,000 and a prior rate of 1.2 per 100,000 (Illinois Department of Public Health, Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Illinois : 2017 Epidemiologic Summary and Yearly Trends Data for 2008 - 2017 ). For 2017, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported a statewide primary and secondary syphilis rate of 9.5 per 100,000 population (1,225 cases reported). The United States rate was also 9.5 per 100,000. For McLean County, the Illinois Department of Public Healt h reported a 2017 primary and secondary syphilis case rate of 0.6 per 100,000 for McLean County, with data for the 10 -year period from 2008 - 2017 demonstrating ranges in the rate from a low of 0.6 (2012; 2017) to a high of 4.1 (2011). Case numbers in McL ean County for primary and secondary syphilis from 2008 - 2017 have ranged from a low of 1 (multiple years) to a high of 7 (2011) (Illinois Department of Public Health, Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Illinois : 2017 Epidemiologic Summary and Yearly Trends Data for 2008 - 2017 ). In October of 2018, McLean County was designated as in outbreak status by the Illinois Department of Public Health when cases of early syphilis (primary, secondary and early latent stages) increased. McLean County case counts for early syphilis for all of 2018 (N=13) and 2019 from January - March (N=13), are considered preliminary data (Illinois Department of Public Health and McLean County Health Department, Communicable Disease Program, 2019).

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) In 2017, there were 16 newly diagnosed cases of HIV in McLean County and four newly diagnosed cases of AIDS. This is higher than the prior value in 2016 of eight cases (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 2017). The Illinois Department of Public Health reports 16 newly diagnosed cases of HIV in 2017 and six newly diagnose d cases of AIDS, with prior values in 2016 of eight cases of HIV and three of newly diagnosed AIDS (Illinois Department of Public Health Report to McLean County Health Department, 2018, 2019). A review of McLean County deaths (preliminary data) occurring January - October 2018 indicated no deaths due to HIV. (McLean County Health Department, Vital Records, 2018). Deaths due to HIV do not rank in the top 10 leading causes of death in McLean County but were in the top 25 for at least five years between 2000 - 2013 (IPLAN Data Set, 2000 - 2013). In 2019, the Illinois Department of Public Health, the Chicago Department of Public Health and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago introduced a new five -year plan to end the HIV epidemic in Illinois by 2030 using the Getti ng to Zero Illinois (GTZ -IL) initiative. The plan includes strategies to reduce the number of new HIV infections to assist Illinois in reaching \"functional zero ,\" the point at which the HIV epidemic cannot be sustained. Vaccine Preventable Diseases Pneumonia and Influenza Twenty -seven percent of McLean County adults have received a pneumonia vaccine at some point in their lifetime. This is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) when compared to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2010 - 2014 ). According to the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( 2010 - 2014 ), 38.5 percent of McLean County adults received an influenza vac cination in the past 12 months. McLean County does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 70 percent. When compared to other counties in Illinois , McLean County falls in the worst 50th - 75th percentile (yellow indicator) for this measure (Conduent Healt hy Communities Institute, Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2010 - 2014 ). The annual age -adjusted emergency room visit rate due to immunization -preventable pneumonia and influenza for 2015 - 2017 was 7.3 visits per 10,000 population ages 18 years or older (Conduent Health Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2015 - 2017 ). When compared to other counties in Illinois , this measure falls in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator). McLean County's age -adjust ed death rate due to influenza and pneumonia is 11.1 deaths per 100,000 population, which is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) when compared to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Centers for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention, 2015 - 2017). The rate is lower than the Illinois rate (15.3 deaths per 100,000 population), 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 105 not statistically different from the prior value for McLean County (9.6 deaths per 100,000 population) and is trending favorably in a statist ically significant direction.

Other Vaccine Preventable Diseases Immunization Status for School -Age Children The immunization status of school -age children in McLean County exceeds recommended Illinois Department of Public Health -specified levels necessary to prevent epidemics according to immunization data collected from public and non -public schools for the 2013 - 2014 school year, the most curren t data published in 2018 (Illinois State Board of Education, Data Analysis and Accountability Division, Health Requirements/Student Health Data, School Year 2013 - 2014). Over 98 percent of students were fully protected or in compliance with vaccination re quirements. The Healthy People 2020 goal for Measles - 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 106 Mumps -Rubella (MMR) vaccination is 90 percent. McLean County has exceeded the national goal as well as the Illinois rate of 94.7 percent for completion of two doses of MMR . See Exhibit 87 below.

Additional school -age data from the 2013 - 2014 school year is available for Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis), Hepatitis B and Varicella (Chickenpox); however, those protection rates vary by grade level. Measles \u2014Mumps \u2014Rubella (MMR) In the United States in 2019, measles outbreaks were occurring in seven states (New York, Michigan, New Jersey, California, Georgia, Maryland and Pennsylvania) related to unvaccinated international travelers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 20 19). Since measles was eliminated in the United States in 2000, the annual number of people reported with measles ranged from a low of 37 in 2004 to a high of 839 cases in 2019 (January 1 to May 10, 2019). The 2019 case count is the largest number of cases reported in the United States since 1994. Measles cases in 2019 have been confirmed in 23 states, including Illinois (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). As of May 1, 2019, there have been no cases of measles reported in McLean County. The last documented case in McLean County was 1989 (Illinois Department of Public Health, May 2019). In Illinois, over the past 10 years, case numbers have ranged from zero to 17. See Exhibit 88 below. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 107 Exhibit 88: Measles Case Coun ts - Illinois, 2010 - 2019* 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Number of Cases 0 3 0 5 2 17 2 0 5 7 *Current case count for 2019 as of early May 2019.

During the 2015 outbreak, 71 cases were reported, and 88 percent of cases were in persons ages 15-24 years. During the 2016 outbreak, 41 cases were reported and 95 percent of cases were in persons ages 15-24 years (McLean County Health Department , Bloomington , Illinois , 2018). Rubella was last reported in McLean County in 1990 (McLean County Health Department, Bloomington Illinois , 2019). Pertussis (Whooping Cough) Many pertussis cases are not diagnosed and therefore not reported. Between 2012 and 2016, McLean County saw an increase in the number of pertussis cases (McLean County Health Department, Bloomington , Illinois , 2018 ). Se e Exhibit 89 below.

The Healthy People 2020 objectives for pertussis focus on reducing the cases of pertussis among children under the age of one and those ages 11 to 18 years. In both 2015 and 2016, most cases identified in McLean County occurred in children between 10 to 19 years , 47 percent of cases in 2015 and 54 percent in 2016. For comparison, in 2014, there were nine cases of pertussis reported in McLean County. Nineteen percent of cases occurred in children under the age of one and 27 percent occurred in individuals 11 to 18 years of age from 2010 to 2014. During this period, pertussis cases in McLean County and Illinois declined 33 percent and 38 percent, respectively (Illinois Department of Public Health , IQuery, 2010 - 2014 ). Varicella (Chickenpox) Data on the number of varicella outbreaks that occur each year in the U nited States is lacking due to variations in reporting requirements. In the United States, the vaccine was licensed for use in March 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 108 1995. Since its introduction, the number of outbreaks ha s decreased, de monstrated through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Varicella Active Surveillance Project (VASP) that was active from 1995 - 2010 . Because of implementing the two-dose varicella vaccine, sites participating in VASP saw a 90 percent decrease in varicella cases from 1995 - 2008 . Among infants , varicella disease decreased 90 percent (1995 - 2008) and 74 percent among adults (1995 - 2005) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Varicella Active Surveillance Project). In Illino is, varicella is a reportable disease. The Healthy People 2020 goal is to reduce the cases of varicella among persons ages 17 years or under. In McLean County, there has been a 60 percent decrease in reported varicella cases from 2012 to 2016 . In 2012, the re were 25 cases, 12 (48 percent) of which were amongst children 17 years of age or under. In 2015, there were 15 cases, with eight (53 percent) amongst children 17 years of age or under (McLean County Health Department, Bloomington , Illinois , 2018). Men tal Health Mental illnesses are one of the leading causes of disability in the United States. In any given year, approximately 13 million American adults have a seriously debilitating mental illness. Furthermore, unstable mental health can lead to suicide , which accounts for the death of approximately 30,000 Americans every year ( Conduent Healthy Communities Institute , 201 9). Age-Adjusted Emergency Room Rates Mental Health (Adults) The age -adjusted emergency room rate due to mental health is 92.1 emergency room visits per 10,000 population ages 18 years and olde r for McLean County .

The crisis center answers over 90,000 calls annually through the 24 -hour, seven day a week 2 -1-1 crisis hotline . Percent of Medicare Beneficiaries Receiving Treatment for Depression The percent of Medicare beneficiaries receiving treatment for depression in McLean County is 15.8 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Center fo r Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2015). This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois , is higher than the Illinois value (15.1 percent ), higher than the prior value for McLean County (15.8 percent ) and is trending unfavorably but not in a statistically significant direction. Self-Reported Mental Health Illinois Youth Survey Teens Feeling Sad or Hopeless The average percentage of eighth, tenth and twelfth graders in McLean County who r eported they felt so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that they stopped doing some usual activities was 31 percent (Illinois Youth Survey , 2018). This is an increase from the 2016 value of 28 percent. Teens Who Considered A ttempting Suicide The average percentage of tenth and twelfth graders in McLean County who reported they seriously considered attempting suicide during the past 12 months is 16 percent (Illinois Youth Survey, 2018). This is similar to the 2016 value of 16 .5 percent. County Health Rankings Frequent Mental Distress The percentage of adults in McLean County who stated that their mental health was not good for 14 or more of the past 30 days is 10.7 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, 2016). This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile ra nge (green indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois , is higher than the Illinois value (10 percent ) and is not statistically different than the prior value for McLean County (10.1 percent ).

The following relationships wer e found using correlational analyses: Depression tends to be rated higher by older people, those with lower education and income and those with an unstable (e.g. , homeless) housing environment Anxiety tends to be rated higher by older people, those with lower education and income and those with an unstable (e.g. , homeless) housing environment Frequency of self -medication tends to be rated higher for those with an unstable (e.g. , homeless) housing environment (McLean County Community Health Survey , 2018). ICD-9 and ICD -10 Hospital Data Psychiatric visits were the second most common reason for patient visits to Advocate BroMenn Medical Center 's emergency room from 2012 to 2017 ( Advocate BroMenn Medical Center , ICD -9 and 10 Diagnosis. 2012 - 2017). Psychiatric visits were not in the top ten reasons for patient visits to OSF St. Joseph Medical Center 's emergency room. Advocate BroMenn Medical Center has the only in -patient mental health unit in McLean County. This is one reason why OSF St. Jose ph Medical Center does not see similar numbers of patients due to psychiatric visits in their emergency room ( OSF St. Joseph Medical Center , Top ICD -9 and 10, Diagnosis, 2012 - 2017). Oral Health Economic Impact of Inadequate Oral Health care The average cost of a Medicaid enrollee's inpatient hospital treatment for dental problems is nearly 10 times more expensive than the cost of preventive care delivered in a dentist's office. From 2008 - 2011, a Pew Research Center study noted that there we re approximately 77,000 dental visits to hospitals in the Chicago Metro area. When children miss school due to illness, parents may miss work as well to stay home with them. A study published in 2011 noted that children with poor oral health were more like ly to: 1) have pain; 2) miss school; and 3) demonstrate poor academic performance (The P ew Research Center on the States , A Costly Dental Destination: Hospital Care Means States Pay Dearly (2012) ; S.L. Jackson, W.F. Vann, J. Kotch, B.T. Pahel \"Impact Poor Oral Health of Children's School Attendance and Performance,\" American Journ al of Public Health 101 (2011): 1900 - 1906). Adults Who Visited a Dentist In 2007 - 2009, 79.8 percent of McLean County residents visited a dentist or dental cl inic within the past year (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2007 - 2009). This percentage is higher than the 2016 state rate (65.5 percent) and is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indi cator) when compared to other counties in Illinois . See Exhibit 98 below. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 117 Exhibit 98: McLean County Adults Who visited a Dentist or Dental Clinic within the Past Year , 2007 - 2009 McLean County 79.8% Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2007 - 2009 . Age-Adjusted Emergency Room Rate due to Dental Problems The age -adjusted emergency room rate due to dental problems for McLean County is 45.6 emergency room visits per 10,000 population (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2015 - 2017 ). This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois . The rates for the following ZIP code s, however, are all in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) compared to other ZIP codes in Illinois: Bloomington ZIP code 61701 , Chenoa ZIP code - 61726, Stanford - 61774 and Saybrook ZIP code 61770. See the disparities bullet points b elow for rates for the ZIP codes. Disparities The highest emergency room rates in McLean County due to dental problems are seen in: individuals ages 25 - 34 (128.4 emergency room visits per 10,000 population 18+ years) individuals ages 35 - 44 (75.0 emergency room visits per 10,000 population 18+ years) Blacks or African Americans (156.2 emergency room visits per 10,000 population 18+ years) those living in the following ZIP codes: o Bloomington ZIP code 61701 ( 100.2 emergency room visits per 10,000 pop ulation or 120 percent higher than the county rate) o Chenoa ZIP code 61726 (76.5 emergency room visits per 10,000 population or 68 percent higher than the county rate) o Stanford ZIP code 61774 (69.8 emergency room visits per 10,000 population or 53 percent h igher than the county rate) o Saybrook ZIP code 61770 (78.8 emergency room visits per 10,000 population or 73 percent higher than the county rate) . 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 118 School District Oral Health Data Compliance with Oral Health Exams The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) posts oral health exam compliance rates. As of late 2018, the most recent data published was for the 2013 -2014 school year. In Kindergarten, McLean County school districts report an average of 93.4 percent com pliance with oral health exams; in second grade that figure d ecreases to 83.5 percent and in sixth grade decreases again to 79.3 percent ( Illinois State Board of Education , 2013 - 2014 School Year ). District level data is available upon request or on the I llinois State Board of Education's website. Compliance with oral health exams generally trends unfavorably as children age from Kindergarten to sixth grade . Disparities The largest school districts in the county , Unit 5 and D istrict 87, have the highest rates of non - compliance with oral exams at every grade level. Percentage of Children with Untreated Dental Caries Seventeen percent of McLean County Kindergarteners, 16.5 percent of second graders and 10.5 percent of sixth graders had untreated dental caries noted on their 2013 - 2014 dental exam form (Illinois State Board of Education , 2013 -2014). See Exhibit 99 and 100 below for a comparison of this data.

For the 2013 - 2014 school year, the percent of McLean County children with untreated dental caries meets and exceeds the Healthy People 2020 targets in all three grades that currently require a dental exam (Kindergarten, second grade and sixth grade); however, the finding that 10.5 percent - 17 percent of children have a preventable health condition indicates a need for further targeted public information to encourage oral healthcare to reduce preventable dental caries. Disparities 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 120 ISBE data ( 2013 - 2014 ) indicates that Illinois children in public schools (Kindergarten, second and sixth grade) have a higher percentage of caries experience/restoration history, untreated caries and children need ing urgent treatment for an oral health issue than children in no n-public schools Healthy People 2020: In 2013 - 2014, a disparity between Black or African American children (not Hispanic or Latino) and White Only (not Hispanic or Latino) children ages 6 -9 years old was identified regarding the percentage of untreated d ental decay: o Black or African American: 24.9 percent (this is an improvement from 2011 - 2012 data: 31.8 percent ) o White: 11.5 percent Healthy People 2020: In 2013 - 2014, 25. 7 percent of adolescents (ages 13 -19) with untreated dental decay had public ins urance, while 10.3 percent of adolescents with untreated dental decay had private insurance. Access to Oral Health care In the U nited States (2009), 56 percent of Medicaid -enrolled children did not receive dental care. A Pew Research Center study noted that this could be due to many factors, including that many dentists do not accept Medicaid and that there is a shortage of dentists in some areas of the country (The Pew Research Center, Center on the States, A Costly Dental Destination: Hospital Care Mean s States Pay Dearly , 2012 ). Respiratory Disease Currently in the United States, more than 23 million people have asthma. Additionally, a pproximately 13.6 million adults have been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . Because of the cost to the healthcare system, the burden of respiratory diseases also falls on society; it is paid for with higher health insurance rates, lost productivity and tax dollars. Annual healthcare expenditures for asthma alone are estimated at $20.7 billion ( Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, 2019 ). Age-Adjusted Emergency Room and Hospitalization Rates The age -adjusted emergency room and hospitalization rates for numerous respiratory indicators are illustrated in Exhibit 101 below . A summary of McLean County rates for both emergency room visits and hospitalizations for the indicators are listed in the table . Emergency room visits due to adult asthma , asthma (all ages) and hospitalizations due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities, Illinois Hospital Association, 2015 - 2017 ). 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 121 Exhibit 101: Summary of Age -Adjusted Emergency Room Visits and Hospitalizations for Respiratory Indicators for McLean County , 2015 - 2017 Indicator rate due to: Emergency room visits/10,000 population Indicator Color (McLean County compared to Other Counties in Illinois ) Hospitalizations/10,000 population Indicator Color (McLean County compared to Other counties in Illinois ) Adult Asthma 18+ years 25.7 4.9 Asthma All ages 27.6 4.1 Pediatric Asthma <18 years 33.1 1.8 Not available COPD 18+ years 22.8 23.2 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities, Illinois Hospital Association, 2015 - 2017 .

Disparities by ZIP code are shown below (when data is available) for the nine highest SocioNeeds ZIP codes in McLean County. Out of the nine highest SocioNeeds ZIP codes in the county, only Bloomingto n - 61701 , Saybrook - 61770 and Funks Grove - 61754 had disparities data for respiratory disease indicators. The difference in the rates for Bloomington - 61701 are approximately double for the three indicators exhibit ed below. Saybrook - ZIP code 61770 ha d a disparity for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at 136 percent , or more than double the county rate (Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2015 - 2017). See Exhibit 104 below. Exhibit 104: Respiratory Disparities by ZIP Code for Age-Adjusted Emergency Room Visits for McLean County , 2015 - 2017 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities, Illinois Hospital Association, 2015 - 2017 . For respiratory disparities by ZIP code for hospitalizations, only Bloomington - 61701 showed a disparity. In comparison to the rate for McLean County (23.2 hospitalizations per 10,000 population 18+ years), the rate for Bloomington - 61701 (37.5 hospitalizations per 10,000 population 18+ years) is 62 percent higher (Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2015 - 2017).

In 2017, case rates per 100,000 were 1.15 in McLean County, 2.62 for Illinois and 2.8 for the United States. The National T uberculosis Program Objectives and Performance target for 2020 is no more than 1.4 cases per 100,000, the same target used by the Illinois Department of Public Health . In 2018, the McLean County case rate remained at 1.15, still meeting the nati onal target, while the Illinois rate moved to 2.48 per 100,000 (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2017 and 2018; McLean County Health Department, Bloomington I llinois , 2019) . 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 126 Age-Adjusted Hospitalizations due to Dehydration \u2014Adults The age -adjusted hospitalization rate in McLean County due to dehydration is 10.6 hospitalizations per 10,000 population 18 years and older (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2015 - 2017 ).

Statewide, the range is 49 percent to 54 percent for the same period (The Annie E. Casey Foundation Kids Count Data Center, Children Enrolled in Medical Assistance Programs by County, McLean, 2018) . Mothers Who Drank Alcohol Before, During or After Pregnancy In 2016, 99 percent of McLean County and Illinois women reported abstaining from drinking alcohol during pregnancy (Illinois Department of Public Health, IQuery, from Vital Statistics, 2016). The 2016 Illinois Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring (PRAMS) anonymous survey was sent to 2,307 Illinois mothers who had delivered a live infant; 1,382 responded. Of those completing the survey, 59.9 percent reported consuming alcoholic beverages during the three months before pregnancy; 40.1 percent abstained. This is an increase over the 2009 PRAMS, which reported 53 percent drank alcoholic beverages on a weekly basis during the three months prior to pregnancy; 47 percent abstained. PRAMS data indicates that Illinois has not met the Healthy People 2020 goal to increase the percent of pregnant females ages 15 to 44 years who report abstaining from alcohol in the past 30 days to 98.3 percent. The 2016 PRAMS anonymous survey does not address alcohol use dur ing or after pregnancy. The 2009 PRAMS data notes that during pregnancy, seven percent consumed alcohol during the last three months of pregnancy, 93 percent abstained. The Healthy People 2020 goal of 98.3 percent was not achieved (Illinois Department of P ublic Health PRAMS Survey, 2009 and 2016). Mothers Who Smoked During Pregnancy The percentage of births that were to mothers that smoked and/or used tobacco products during pregnancy in McLean County is 10.8 percent. Compared to other counties in Illinois , McLean County is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) for this measure; however, this percentage is higher than the Healthy People 2020 goal to \" decrease the percentage of women who gave birth and who smoked cigarettes during p regnancy to 1.4 percent\" (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 2008). Data from 2011 to 2016 indicates that the percent of babies born to McLean County mothers who report smoking during pregnancy ranges from a low of 11.4 percent (2012) to a high of 13.7 percent (2015) during the six -year period of 2011 - 2016. The rate in 2016 was 12.7 percent. The McLean County rate remained higher than the Illinois rate (a low of 7.9 percent to a high of 10.7 percent) all six yea rs (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Birth Data Files, 2011 - 2016, . Mothers Who Use Other Substances During Pregnancy Infants who are born and thought to have been exposed to illegal substances, through observation by physicians or by toxicology test results, are reported to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). These cases are investigated by DCFS to verify the infant's prenatal exposure . This information is not available at th e county level. The most recent state -level data available in 2018 is from 2013, identifying 447 substance exposed infants (0.29 percent) out of the 155,528 live births in Illinois. This is the second lowest rate in the six-year period of 2008 -2013 (Illino is Department of Children and Family Services, Abuse and Neglect Statistics, Substance Exposed Infants, November 2015). 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 142 Maternal Age Data from 2011 to 2016 indicates that the percent of mothers ages 35 and over has continued to rise since 2011 for both M cLean County and Illinois . The percent of live births to McLean County women in this age category has moved from a low of 10.6 percent (2012) with 229 live births to a high of 13.6 percent (2016) with 291 live births. The McLean County percentage has remai ned lower than the Illinois rates (16.5 percent to 18.1 percent) during the eight -year period of 2009 - 2016 (Illinois Department of Public Health, Vital Statistics, 2011 - 2016). Maternal Mortality In Illinois from 2008 to 2016, an average of 73 women d ied each year within one year of their pregnancy. During 2015, 93 Illinois women died within one year of their pregnancy, and obesity contributed to 44 percent of these pregnancy -related deaths. Death review committees in Illinois note that at least 72 percent of pregnancy -related deaths are preventable. Great disparities exist for maternal mortality. A non -Hispanic Black or African American woman is six times as likely to die from a pregnancy -related condition than a non -Hispanic White woman in Illinois. T hey also had the highest rate of severe maternal morbidity during 2016 - 2017. Common underlying causes for pregnancy -related deaths include: pulmonary embolism and cardiomyopathy (Illinois Department of Public Health, Illinois Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Report, October 2018) . Separate county -level statistics were not provided in the 2018 report. Disparities Maternal mortality in Illinois: A non -Hispanic Black or African American woman is six times more likely to die from a pregnancy -related condition than a non -Hispanic White woman in Illinois (Illinois Department of Public Health, Illinois Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Report, October 2018) Non -Hispanic Black or African American women had the highest rate of severe maternal morbidity during 2016 -2017 (Illinois Department of Public Health, Illinois Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Report, October 2018). Other Maternal Indicators A comparis on of the 2009 and 2016 Illinois Department of Public Health Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) anonymous survey results revealed gains in pre -conception health, a reduction in smoking during the last three months of pregnancy and an impro vement in the percent of postpartum women who breastfed at least once and who placed infants on their backs most of the time (Illinois Department of Public Health , Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System [PRAMS ] 2009 and 2016 ).

Breastfeeding Nationally, 83.2 percent of all infants born in the United States in 2015 started to breastfeed, with 57.6 percent still breastfeeding at six months of age and 35.9 percent breastfeeding at 12 months (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Breastfeeding Report Card, United States, 2018). In McLean County, breastfeeding rates are calculated using reports from the two delivering hosp itals, Advocate BroMenn Medical Center and OSF St. Joseph Medical Center . The percent of infants who were ever breastfed, exclusively breastfed or who received infant formula in addition to breastmilk at the time of hospital discharge was 84.96 percent, an increase over the 2014 rate of 82.9 percent, at Advocate BroMenn Medical Center; and 87.6 percent at OSF St. Joseph Medical Center , a slight decrease over the 2014 rate of 88.0 percent (Illinois Hospital Report Card, 2018, using a cohort of infants born i n 2015, 2016, and 2017). Both local rates exceed the state (80.3 percent), national (83.2 percent) and Healthy People 2020 goal (81.9 percent). In 2016, the rates for McLean County infants exclusively breastfeeding at the time of hospital discharge are 66. 19 percent at Advocate BroMenn Medical Center and 80.1 percent at OSF St. Joseph Medical Center . Exclusively formula fed infants in these two facilities were reported as 13.74 percent at Advocate BroMenn Medical Center and 10.85 percent at OSF St. Joseph M edical Center in 2016 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Breastfeeding Report Card, United States, 2018). 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 144 For the fiscal year 2019, the McLean County WIC Program had a breastfeeding initiation rate of 71 percent, with a six -month breastfeeding du ration rate of 30.5 percent. This rate has held steady from the previous fiscal year, with initiation at 70 percent and six -month duration at 31 percent. The most recent data for exclusive breastfeeding rates at 12 weeks from birth were 16.5 percent in 20 19 (17.4 percent in 2018) (McLean County Health Department, WIC Program, 2019). The McLean County Milk Bank, housed at the McLean County Health Department, has received 11,780 ounces of donated breast milk since the grand opening on February 14th, 2017. The donated milk is shipped to the Mother's Milk Bank of the Western Great Lakes where it is processed and distributed accordingly. In 2019, legislative efforts occurred to seek insurance coverage for breast milk. Live Births In 2017, there were 2,006 l ive births in McLean County. In a nine -year period (2009 - 2017), the number of live births in McLean County ranged from a low of 2,006 (2017) to a high of 2,169 (2012). There has been a decrease of 7.5 percent in the number of live births in McLean County when comparing 2012 to 2017 .

In 2015, the state of Illinois began reporting race and ethnicity (Non -Hispanic White; Non -Hispanic Black; Non -Hispanic Other; Hispanic) for live births. Prior to 2015, all women giving birth and reporting 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 145 Hispanic et hnicity were included in the White race category . In 2017, the most recent year with available data, 70.3 percent (1,412) of live births in McLean County were non -Hispanic White, 12.7 percent (254) non-Hispanic Black, 10.5 percent (211) non -Hispanic other, and 6.4 percent (129) were Hispanic (Illinois Department of Public Health, Vital Statistics \u2014Births , 2009 - 2017) .

For 2009 - 2014 , the percent for Hispanic is the percent of all live births who were of Hispanic ori gin. Beginning in 2015 , the state started categorizing \"race and ethnicity ,'' rather than listing them separately . For 2015 - 2017 , four categories were used: Non -Hispanic White, Non -Hispanic Black, Non -Hispanic Other and Hispanic . All four of these categories now add up to the total of all live births. Note: The percent of Hispanic origin live births compares across all years, 2009 through 2017, as it is, in both cases, the percent of all live births. Source: Illinois Department of Public Health, Vital Statistics, Births, 2009 - 2017 by Cesarean Section In October 2011, a collaborative effort began between Advocate BroMenn Medical Center, OSF St. Joseph Medical Center , the March of Dimes and local physicians. The March of Dimes initiative of no elective inductions prior to 39 weeks without medical necessi ty began. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 146 In an eight -year period (2009 - 2016), the rate of cesarean sections performed during labor and delivery in McLean County has been consistently higher than both the Illinois and national rates. In 2016, 35.8 percent (724) of live births resulted from cesarean sections . The annual rate ranged from a low of 33.1 percent (677) in 2009, to a high of 39.4 percent (824) in 2011. The Healthy People 2020 target is to have no more than 23.9 percent of live births by cesarean section. In 2016, McLean Count y continued to exceed both the state (31.1 percent) and national (31.9 percent) rate as well as the Healthy People 2020 goal (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, 2018; Illinois Department of Public Health, Bir th Characteristics, 2018). Births to Adolescent Mothers In McLean County, the number of births to adolescent mothers (individuals under age 20) has steadily decreased over the past eleven years, falling 60.7 percent from 2007 to 2017. For 201 7, McLean Co unty experienced a rate of 0 .0 live births per 1,000 adolescent females , lower than the Illinois rate of 18.7 and the national rate of 20.3. McLean County remains well below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 36.2 pregnancies per 1,000 adolescent females ages 15 - 17 years (Illinois Department of Public Health, Vital Statistics, 2018; County Health Rankings 2018 ).

Nationally, neonatal mortality (deaths occurring during days 0 - 27) is associated with gestational age, low birth weight and congenital malformations, or the development of other health problems be fore or after birth. Post -neonatal mortality (deaths occurring during days 28 - 364) is associated with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), unintentional injury and congenital malformations (Illinois Department of Public Health, Infant Mortality webpage, 2018). In Illinois, in 2017, the top ten leading causes of infant death were disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight; congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities; accidents affect ed by maternal complications of pregnancy; newborn affected by complications of placenta, cord and membranes; SIDS ; bacterial sepsis of the newborn; assault (homicide); influenza and pneumonia; and respiratory distress of the newborn (Illinois Department o f Public Health, Infant Mortality Statistics, 2010 - 2017) . No data was available on the Illinois Department of Public Health website regarding the leading causes of infant mortality for McLean County. The infant mortality rate for McLean County is 6.6 deaths per 1,000 live births. This is in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois , is higher than the Illinois value of 6.3 deaths per 1,000 live births but lower than the prior value from 2013 -2015 o f 7.5 deaths per 1,000 live births. The number of deaths is trending unfavorably, but not in a statistically significant direction and does not meet the Healthy People target of 6.0 deaths per 1,000 live births (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illi nois Department of Public Health, 2014 -2016) . The Illinois Department of Public Health reports McLean County infant mortality rates have ranged from a low of 5.7 deaths per 1,000 live births (2010) to a high of 10.5 (2011), with the number of deaths rang ing from 8 - 22. State rates showed far less variation, ranging from a low of 6.0 deaths per 1,000 live births (2013 , 2015) to 6.8 (2010) (Illinois Department of Public Health, Infant Mortality Statistics, 2010 - 2017) .

Low Birth Weight (<2,500 grams; less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces) In McLean County , 8.5 percent of the babies are considered to have low birth weight , which is in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois and does not meet the Healthy People 2020 target of 7.8 percent. The rate is trending unfav orably, but not in a statistically significant direction (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 2016) . See Exhibit 125 below.

Congenital Anomalies Major structural or genetic birth defe cts affect approximately three percent of the births in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018) . In Illinois, one in 23 infants born has a major birth defect (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Birth Defects Tracking i n Illinois, Illinois Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes Reporting System [APORS], 2018). Current McLean County -specific data was not found. In 2004, the IPLAN data set reported the overall congenital anomaly incidence rate for McLean County was 530.6 per 10,000 live births. The Illinois rate that year was 397.6 per 10,000 live births (Illinois Department of Public Health, IPLAN Data Set, 2004). McLean County congenital anomaly prevalence rates for 2008 - 2009 far exceed the state rates in three categories: cardio vascular system defects, major genitourinary defects and major musculoskeletal defects. McLean County has the ninth highest prevalence rate in Illinois for cardiovascular system defects at 206.5 defects per 10,000 live births, the ninth highest prevalence rate for major genitourinary defects at 74.9 defects per 10,000 live births and the third highest prevalence rate for major musculoskeletal defects at 22.8 defects per 10,000 live births . All county rates are well above the state rates of 104.4, 58.8, and 15.8 respectively (Illinois Department of Public Health , Birth Defects and Other Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Illinois, 2005 - 2009, October 2013). Key findings: Maternal and Child Health A comparison of the 2009 and 2016 Illinois Department of Public Health Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) anonymous survey results revealed gains in pre - conception health, a reduction in smoking during the last three months of pregnancy and an improvement in the percent of postpartum women who breastfe d at least once and who placed infants on their backs most of the time . The rate of cesarean sections performed during labor and delivery in McLean County has been consistently higher than both the Illinois and national rates . McLean County has a higher p ercentage of mothers who report smoking during pregnancy than the state rates . A non -Hispanic Black or African American woman is six times as likely to die from a pregnancy - related condition than a non -Hispanic White woman in Illinois . Breastfeeding initia tion at the time of hospital discharge is higher in McLean County than the state, nation and Healthy People 2020 goal . The rate of births to adolescents in McLean County is lower than the Illinois and United States rates and it meets and exceeds the Health y People 2020 goal . McLean County's infant mortality rate , although decreasing since its high level in 2011, remains higher than the Illinois rate and the Healthy People 2020 goal . It falls in the worst 50th - 75th percentile (yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois . 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 150 No new data is available for congenital anomalies. Data from 2008 - 2009 indicates McLean County rates far exceed the state rates in the areas of cardiovascular system defects, major genitourinary defects and major musculoskele tal defects. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 151 VI. Prioritization of Health -Related Issues a) Community Health Survey: Percepti ons of Health Issues, Unhealthy Behaviors and Issues Impacting Quality of Life To aid in identifying the high priority health issues in McLean County, the 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey asked respondents to report on their perceptions of the three most important health issues, unhealthy behaviors and factors that contribute to well -being in the community. Perceptions of Health Issues 2018 McLean Co unty Community Health S urvey respondents perceive their community as having two major health issues: mental health and being overweight and/or obese. The remaining health issues addressed in Exhibit 127 show a dramatic decrease in perception of health for the community. Eighty - two percent of survey respondents feel mental health is the biggest health issue, with over half of the respondents being concerned about people's extra body weight. Exhibit 127: Perception of Health Issues in McLean County, 2018 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2018 . Comparison to the 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey This perception is similar to the 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey in which mental health (60 percent), obesity/overweight (39 percent) and cancer (34 percent) were the top three health concerns Aging Issues Cancer Dental Health Heart disease Diabetes Chronic Pain Early Sexual Activity STIs 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 152 Perception of Issues Impacting Quality of Life Survey respondents were asked to select the three most important issues impacting well -being in the comm unity (See Exhibit 128). The three top issues impacting well -being are access to healthcare (59 percent), healthy food choices (43 percent) and job opportunities (40 percent). Exhibit 128: Issues Impacting Quality of Life in McLean County , 2018 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2018 . Comparison to the 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey The top three concerns from the 2015 Community Health Survey yielded similar results: job opportunities (41 percent), access to healthcare (40 percent) and healthy food choices (36 percent). Perceptions of Unhealthy Behaviors 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey respondents identified illegal drug abuse (52 percent), alcohol abuse (42 percent), legal drug abuse (3 2 percent) and smoking (22 percent) as the unhealthy behaviors affecting their community's perception of health. Poor eating habits was the second highest rating with 42 p ercent of survey respondents perceiv ing this as an unhealthy behavior.

The most significant and number of geographic disparities are evident between Bloomington ZIP code 61701 and McLean County overall. Exhibit 131 below shows that emergency room visits due to dental problems, substance use, opioid use, alcohol use, pediatric and adult asthma, pediatric and adult mental health, hypertension, heart failure, Type 2 diabetes and both adolescent and adult suicide and s elf- inflicted injury are higher for Bloomin gton ZIP code 61701 than the rates for McLean County overall. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 155 Exhibit 131: Age -Adjusted Emergency Room Visit Rates per 10,000 Population (various age categories) in McLean County vs. Bloomington ZIP Code 61701 , 2015 - 2017 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2015 - 2017 . In addition to the above disparities, the following age -adjusted emergency room rates, in comparison to the overall rate for McLean County, are: 71 percent higher in Bellfower ZIP code 61724 for mental health (18 years and older) 60 percent higher in Che noa - 61726 for suicide and intentional self -inflicted (18 years and older) 68 percent higher in Chenoa ZIP code 61726 for dental problems 53 percent higher in Stanford ZIP code 61774 for dental problems 73 percent higher in Saybrook ZIP code 61770 for dental problems 136 percent higher in Saybrook ZIP code 61770 for COPD (18 years and older) .

In addition to the above disparities, the following age -adjusted hospitalizations in comparison to the overall rate for McLean County are: 75 percent higher in Chenoa ZIP code 61726 for heart failure (18 years and older) 136 percent higher in Chenoa 61726 for diabetes (18 years and older) 285 percent higher in Chenoa 61726 for short -term complications due to diabetes (18 years and older) . Racial and Ethnic Disparities In McLean County, Blacks or African Americans visit the emergency room at higher rates than McLean County residents overall for numerous age-adjusted emergency room visit r ates available through Conduent Healthy Communities Institute . Data for Hispanics is not available for all indicators listed in Exhibit 133 below .

According to the 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey, Whites tend to report higher rates of access to prescription medication , having and seeking out a primary care provider when needed, having personal insurance and accessing dental care. When looking at all chronic conditions listed in Exhibit 133 above , Black s or African American s have higher rates of disparities than any other race in McLean County, based on emergency room visits. Similarly, Hispanics have greater disparities in Type 2 Diabetes, adult asthma and hypertension when compared to the rate for McLean County. Many facto rs contribute to health disparities such as income level, education level and stable housing environment. According to the 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey, individuals with a higher income tend to have private insurance, use a clinic or doctor's office more often and report ease of access to medical care, dental care and counseling. Individuals with lower incomes are less likely to seek medical care, report higher usage of the emergency room and experience more poor mental health days.

By determining the most important health issues, it is hoped that more significant advances can be made in a shorter amount of time. In the fall o f 2018 and early 2019 , the Executive Steering Committee met every other week to analyze the primary and secondary data presented in this report . By considering the criteria below, the Executive Steering Committee identified the significant health needs to present to the McLean County Community Hea lth Council for prioritization: Size of the issue Worse rates than Illinois counties or state rate s Disparities by race/ethnicity, age, gender or ZIP code Does not meet the Healthy People 2020 target . Six Significant Health Needs Identified for Prioritization The six significant health needs that were presented to the McLean County Community Health Council for prioritization at three meetings held on January 31, February 14 and February 28, 2019 were: Access to Appropriate Care Behavioral Health (mental health and substance use) Healthy Eating and Active Living (exercise, nutrition , obesity and food access/insecurity) Heart Disease Oral Health Respiratory Disease . McLean County Community Health Council P rioritization Meeting s January 31, 2019 The purpose of the first meeting was to explain the collaborative nature of the joint 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment with Advocate BroMenn Medical Center , the McLean County Health Department, OSF St. Joseph Medical Center and Chestnut Health Systems in addition to the end goal of producing a joint Community Health Improvement Plan for McLean County . Annual Report h ighlights from 2017 and 2018 for the 2017 - 2019 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan were also reviewed with the council. February 14, 2019 During the second meeting, the Executive Steering Committee presented detailed data on the significant health needs identified for prioritization. Age, gender, race/ethnic and ZIP code disparities were shared when available. A group discussion was facilitated on the health issues presented. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 159 February 28, 2019 During the final prioritization meeting, a prioritiz ation method was used to the select the three significant health needs for the 2019 McLea n County Community Health Needs Assessment and around which the 2020 - 2022 McLean County Co mmunity Health Improvement P lan will be developed . The Hanlon Method, developed by J.J. Hanlon, was the prioritization method utilized by the McLean County Commun ity Health Council to select three significant health needs for McLean County to address through a joint Community Health Improvement Plan . The Hanlon Method is a well -respected quantitative technique promoted by the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) . Prioritization ratings are based on the size of the health problem, seriousness of the health problem and effectiveness of available inter ventions. As shown in Exhibit 134, prioritization ratings are given on a scale of zero to 10. Exhibit 134: Hanlon Method Criteria , 2009 Rating Size of the Health Problem (% of population w/ health problem) Seriousness of the Health Problem Effectiveness of Available Interventions 9 or 10 >25% Very serious 80% - 100% effective 7 or 8 10% - 24.9% Relatively serious 60% - 80% effective 5 or 6 1% - 9.9% Serious 40% - 60% effective 3 or 4 0.1 % - 0.9% Moderately serious 20% - 40% effective 1 or 2 0.01% - 0.09% Relatively not serious 5% - 20% effective 0 <.01% Not serious <5% effective Source: National Association of City and County Health Officials, First Things First: Prioritizing Health Problems, 2009. The following guidelines helped determine the ratings for each criterion: Size of the health problem or percent of the population with the health problem : o The average size rating of numerous indicators for each health issue was calculated to arrive at an overall size rating . o The midpoint of the range for percent of population wi th a health problem was used to determine a single size rating per indicator . For example , 0.57 percent of the population 18 years and older visits the emergency room due to alcohol use . This percentage falls in the r ange of 0.1 percent to 0.9 percent for a size rating of three or four. The midpoint for this range is .5 percent . Since 0.57 percent is greater than the midpoint of 0.5 percent, it is given a size rating of four . Seriousness of the health problem; the following questions were taken into consideration when rating seriousness: o Does it require immediate attention? 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 160 o Is there public demand to address the issue? o What is the economic impact? o What is the impact on quality of life? o Is there a high hospitalization and death rate? o Are there severe di sparities associated with this issue? Is the issue more prevalent in certain populations or ZIP codes? Is the morbidity burden greater in certain populations? Are certain populations more likely to die of this condition? Effectiveness of available interven tions : are evidence -based and effective interventions available? Are they scientifically supported? Are they recommended? McLean County Community Health Council members were provided with an explanation of the Hanlon Method from the National Association o f County and C ity Health Officials ( Appendix 6) to assist with rating the seriousness and effectiveness of each health problem. The size ratings were pre -populated by the Executive S teering Committee in the Hanlon Method Table and pro vided to the council ( Appendix 7) to decrea se subjectivity . See Appendix 8 for specifics about each size rating estimation. To assist with rating the seriousness of the health problem and the effectiveness of available interventions, the Executive S teering Committee provided the McLean County Community Health Council with a summary handout o f health disparities (Appendix 9), examples of effective and evidenced -based interventions (Appendix 10) and the economic impact of the top s ix significant health needs (Appendix 11). Prior to voting for the significant health needs for the 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan , the 'PEARL' test was applied to the six significant health needs . The 'PEARL' test is used to screen out health problems based on the following feasibility factors: Propriety: Is the program for the health problem suitable? Economics: Does it make economic sense to address the problem? Are there economic consequences if a problem is not addressed? Acceptability: Will a community accept the program? Is it wanted? Resources: Is funding available or potentially available for a program? Legality: Do current laws allow program activities to be implemented? If the answer to any of the questions above is no for any of the significant health needs , then it is eliminated as a choice for prioritization . The council did not answer no to any questions for any of the six significant health needs , so all six issues were voted upon b y the council according to the Hanlon Method criteria. After voting, t he next step in the process was to calculate the priority scores for each of the health issues . Exhibit 135 below illustrates the results of the Hanlon Method scoring with behavioral h ealth, access to appropriate care and healthy eating/active living receiving the top scores. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 161 Exhibit 135: Hanlon Method Prioritization Results , 2019 Health Concern A B C D Size Seriousness Effectiveness of Interventions Priority Score (A+2B) *C Behavioral Health 5.4 9.0 6.9 162.5 Access to Appropriate Care 7.1 8.3 6.8 160.3 Healthy Eating /Active Living 7.8 7.7 6.8 158.1 Heart Disease 4.4 6.5 6.4 111.0 Oral Health 4.6 6.2 6.3 107.7 Respiratory Disease 2.8 5.6 5.8 81.1 Source: McLean County Community Health Council Meeting February 28, 2019. d) Health Needs Selected As illustrated in Exhibit 135 above , behavioral health, access to appropriate care and healthy eating/active living received the top three priority scores according to the Hanlon method calculations with scores of 162.5, 160.3 and 158.1 . There was a clear divide in the scores between the top three issues and the bottom three; heart disease, oral health and respiratory disease. Following a group discussion, the McLean County Community Health Council agreed to select the top three health needs as the ones with the highest priority scores . They are listed below . Access to Appropriate Care Access to appropriate care was selected as a significant health need to be addressed by the McLean County Community Health Council not only because of its high priority score (1 60.3 ), but for several other reasons. Access to appropriate care is an importan t issue that affects many health outcomes. Improving access in certain areas and for certain populations can have a widespread impact on a variety of health outcomes ranging from oral health to respiratory disease . Data presented to the council also indica ted that there are significant geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in McLean County that may be related to access to care . Research and subject matter expertise suggested that there are a variety of factors that can improve access to appropriate care ranging from increased hours of operation for urgent care clinics and primary care offices, transportation and education of both consumers and providers . Access to appropriate care was also selected as a health priority for the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 162 Behavioral Health (Me ntal Health and Substance Abuse) Behavioral health was selected as a significant health need to be addressed by the McLean County Community Health Council for several reasons . Behavioral health received the highest priority score (162.5 ) clearly indicating the need for further improvements in this area in McLean County. In addition, there are numerous health disparities in Bloomin gton ZIP code 61701 for both mental health and substance abuse. There has also been a great deal of public support and momentum behind mental health in McLean County for the last several years. McLean County is well situated to continue to collaborate on mental health due to the on -going efforts of numerous organizations and the McLe an County Government . Mental health was also previously selected as a key health priority for the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment giving further momentum to the efforts of improving mental health for county residents. Healthy Eating/A ctive Living Healthy eating/active living was selected as a significant health need to be addressed by the McLean County Community Health Council because it ranked as number three according to its priority score of 158.1 . Additionally, the council felt tha t by focusing on healthy eating/active living , many other health outcomes such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes may also positively be impacted. It was also selected because obesity is a widespread issue affecting so many people and it does not discri minate. Food insecurity and food access are also areas needing improvement in McLean County. Obesity was selected as a health priority for the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment. e) Health Needs Not Selected Heart Disease Heart disease will not be addressed because it was ranked f ourth according to its priority score of 111.1 and the McLean County Community Health Council did not feel that there was a compelling reason to eliminate one of the health issues that ranked in the top three. The council did discuss that improving access to appropriate care may possibly also improve health outcomes for heart disease, particularly in areas of high socioeconomic needs. Oral Health Although oral health is deemed as an extremely important issue in McLea n County, the McLean County Community Health Council agreed to address the three needs that received the highest priority scores. Oral health was ranked fifth with a score of 107.7. The council did discuss that oral hea lth is also an access issue and can fit under access to care. The opening of a new dental clinic at the Community Health Care Clinic in early 2019 for individuals without health insurance may assist in improving oral health care access . Respiratory Disea se One of the reasons respiratory disease was not selected as a health need to be addressed was that it ranked sixth according to its priority score of 81.1 and the McLean County Community Health Council did not feel that there was a compelling reason to eliminate one of the health concerns that ranked in 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 163 the top three. The council did discuss that improving access to appropriate care may possibly also improve health outcomes for respiratory disease , particularly in areas of high socioeconomic needs. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 164 VII. Overview of Imp rovement Plan Goals and Community Resources In April and May 2019, three priority action team meetings were held to establish a high -level goal for each significant health need/ priority . Priority action team s consist of key community stakeholders with an interest or expertise in the prioritized health issue . Cross -sector representation was sought for each priority action team. Each priority action team meeting consisted of an overview of the proc ess for completion of the joint community health needs assessment and the joint community health improvement plan. Key highlight s and accomplishments from the first two years of the 2017 - 2019 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan were also pres ented . The health needs identified in the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment are the same as the newly identified health needs for the 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment. A facilitator from the McLean County Executive Steering Committee then led a discussion for each p riority action team to reach consensus for the high - level goal for the 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment priorities. The goals agreed upon by each priority action team are listed below. a) 2020 - 2022 Health Priority Goals Access to Appropriate Care The Access to Appropriate Care Priority Action Team meeting was held on April 29, 201 9. The following goal was established during the meeting: Ensure appropriate access to care to improve th e health and well -being of our residents, neighborhoods and county by 2023. Behavioral Health The Behavioral Health Priority Action Team meeting was held on April 30, 201 9. The following goal was established during the meeting: Advance a systemic communi ty approach to enhance behavioral health and well -being by 2023. Healthy Eating/Active Living The Healthy Eating/Active Living Priority Action Team meeting was held on May 9 , 201 9. The following goal was established during the meeting: Promote healthy eating and active living to strengthen the health and well -being of our community by 2023. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 165 b) Community Resources for the 2020 - 2022 Community Health Improvement Plan Health Priority Goals In the fall of 2019, the priority action teams will meet to determ ine the resources, interventions and outcome metrics for each priority. The 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan will again be a joint plan for the entire county and consist of interventions and resources to be provided by the hospit als, health department, family health center and numerous social services or other community organizations. Community resources specific to the three health priorities are listed in Appendices 1 2 and 1 3. 2019 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment 166 VIII.
