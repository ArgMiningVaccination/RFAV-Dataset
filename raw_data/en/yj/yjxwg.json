In India, we have replicated these moves in an increasingly challenging environment. The healthcare system in India continues to pose a challenge to not just industry but to all stakeholders as it strives to cater to a population of 1.3 billion. As one goes further into the hinterland the problem only gets exacerbated. Low public spending on healthcare, increasing price control and regulations are putting greater pressure on the pharmaceutical industry as it looks to maintain return to shareholders. Implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) willl lead to simplification of the tax structure and a positive impact on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country. In the years to come the use of digital technology in all spheres of life will, we hope, be leveraged for the larger good of healthcare. As a company, we are acutely aware of our responsibility to provide affordable medicines and improve access to healthcare, particularly to the rural poor. I am pleased to share with you that our social business Arogya Parivar has been working relentlessly in this area. In the past six years, more than 31 million people attended over 700 000 health education meetings. During the same period over 1 800 000 people were diagnosed in health camps held in 11 states across the country. Our focus on leprosy through our Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives will help the government's efforts in eliminating this disease. It is truly saddening to know that despite the free medication that is provided globally by Novartis through the World Health Organization (WHO) people continue to delay treatment. A fully curable disease, seeing children diagnosed and ending up with deformity is disheartening. We hope that you, our shareholders, will play a role in spreading awareness of the disease so that together we can make a difference. In August 2015, Novartis signed a new Memorandum with WHO, extending the provision of multidrug therapy (MDT) free of charge to all leprosy patients worldwide until the end of 2020; the Company's collaboration with WHO began in 2000, and was renewed twice, in 2005 and 2010. The year 2016 marked 30 years of Novartis Foundation's commitment to support the leprosy-afflicted. I thank you for the confidence you continue to repose in your Company and am pleased to be able to propose a dividend of 10 per equity share of 5 each on behalf of the Board at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Sincerely,Christopher Snook Chairman NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 201704Dear Shareholder, Novartis continues with its long- term commitment to ensure access to medicines. The environment in which the pharmaceutical industry operates continues to see unprecedented change, particularly at the policy level. The National Health Policy 2017 proposes raising public health expenditure to 2.5% of the GDP in a time-bound manner while providing greater assured comprehensive primary healthcare through Health and Wellness Centers. Success of the rollout of GST in Q2 of the current financial year and its impact on industry in general will depend on its smooth implementation. Efforts of the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority to fix the ceiling prices of medicines through NLEM-2015 continues to severely impact the Company's profitability. Consequently, despite the many productivity measures taken by the Company during the year, the profit before tax margin is low at 12.6% of Total Income. The mandate to prescribe medicines by generic names may negatively impact the Company further. The Company's Total Income from continuing operations for FY 2016-17 is lower by 5.8% compared to the previous year. The profit before tax from continuing operations was ` 917.3 million as against profit of ` 1,113.7 million in the previous corresponding period. Profit was impacted as the Company has had a substantial impact on account of reduction in prices of products covered under NLEM. Total Comprehensive Income for FY 2016-17 was significantly lower at ` 577.2 million as against ` 1,985.8 million in the previous corresponding period, which included profit of ` 1,258 million from discontinued operations of OTC division and Animal Health division. The Company, however, has maintained dividend at 200% for FY 2016-17, subject to your approval, as it believes in a steady dividend policy. Novartis continues with its efforts to do social good, particularly in the battle against leprosy, where it plays a major role through its partnership with the World Health Organization. For centuries, leprosy has posed three kinds of problems to mankind: medical, where it continues to defy science - a vaccine would have made it so much easier to achieve success; public health, where it poses a challenge in the developing world and social, due to the stigma associated with the disease that serves to add to the burden of treatment. Lack of awareness of the disease has created a situation where people find it hard to believe that leprosy continues to be a public health problem. The stigma that continues to be associated with the disease means that people delay seeking medical treatment until deformity sets in. Diagnosing leprosy patients as early as possible will help prevent deformity. More than that, early diagnosis will mean early treatment and this will help interrupt the transmission of this devastating disease. The government's own figures, through the National Leprosy Eradication Program (NLEP), showed that 5 851 cases with Grade 2, or visible, deformities, were NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 2017 05detected between 2014-2016. World Health Organization's Global Leprosy Strategy 2016-2020: Accelerating towards a Leprosy-free World names three countries with large populations that report more than 10 000 new patients annually. India, along with Brazil and Indonesia, is among them. These are only the reported cases; though leprosy has been fully curable since the 1980s, if detected in the early stages, most afflicted people actively seek to hide the illness for fear of the stigma attached. Consistent efforts by leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Vinoba Bhave and, in more recent times, Baba Amte and Mother Teresa, have done little to change the mindsets against leprosy that exist even today. The Indian government's new National Health Policy document, released in March 2017, aims to achieve and maintain elimination status of leprosy by 2018. The inclusion of leprosy as a disease to be eliminated in the national budget is a sign of the importance accorded by the Union Government. The target is certainly ambitious and will require the full support of the private sector. There have been several successful public-private partnerships over the last many years but a great deal still needs to be done to meet and overcome India's health challenges. India has signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2007 ('UNCRPD'), which promotes, protects and ensures the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. It is also a member of the UN General Assembly that unanimously passed a Resolution on Leprosy. The Company's shared commitment to corporate responsibility rests with every Novartis associate. We are proud of what we have accomplished through our efforts, particularly in the area of health, and we look forward to achieving more through our partnerships. We take this opportunity to extend our heartfelt thanks to you, our shareholders, for your continued loyalty and support over the years. Sincerely,Ranjit Shahani Vice Chairman & Managing DirectorIndia has signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2007 ('UNCRPD'), which promotes, protects and ensures the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 201706When Jayashree P.K., a chartered accountant, was a young girl, she was diagnosed with a disease that has been stigmatised since Biblical times - leprosy. Although medical cure was made possible thanks to her being a recipient of the multidrug therapy (MDT) treatment, she lived with self-stigma for several years. Having a very supportive family did little to alleviate her fear - she feared she would never be able to live a normal life, the life that every young girl dreams of. Today, more than 32 years later, Jayashree is happily married, and is the Chief Executive Officer of iBAS, a financial consulting firm. Though reconstructive surgery could have brought her clawed hand back to normal, she has chosen to keep it that way, as a reminder of the work that still needs to be done - even today, delayed diagnosis of the disease due to ignorance and stigma causes several thousands of individuals to end up with disabled limbs. Jayashree has chosen to continue to work for Leprosy, especially in dispelling the myths and stigma surrounding the disease and works for spreading the message - that Leprosy is a simple disease, of no consequence and is easily curable. (Pg 14: Jayashree's story). Since time immemorial, leprosy patients have been ostracized, not only by the larger community, but even by family members. Disfigurement - claw hands, foot drop, eyes that do not close - has often made people believe that the disease is a punishment from God, a sign of heavenly wrath because of some immoral act or a result of karma. In India, eight-year-old Manjeet from Uttar Pradesh, has tears in his eyes when, in The UNwanted , a Novartis- supported film that is available online, he tells his interviewer with more despair than hope that his father will return to take him back home from the Leprosy Mission Trust medical facility near Allahabad. Uma from Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, now in her 50s, has lived with her disfigurement for 18 years; she speaks of how her husband beat her up and threw her out of the house. In the same film, in a social experiment conducted by the film-makers, seven hidden cameras record the reaction of a waiter in a high-end restaurant in Delhi. The waiter not only refuses to serve Ishrat, a visibly disfigured woman, he also insists she will spread the disease to other guests, snatches the plate away from her, declares that she will \"dirty our glasses\" and tries to force her out. In a heartening move, however, other guests at the restaurant intervene and tell the waiter that they have no problem with Ishrat being served. In a country where more than 125 000 new cases are reported each year and thousands of others go unreported, such positive responses are still rare. In many cases, leprosy patients, even when cured, are prevented from accessing social resources such as water, excluded from community gatherings and festivals, and denied education and jobs. Sometimes, even health workers, doctors and medical practitioners discriminate against them. SOME FACTS & FIGURES Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, an acid-fast, rod-shaped bacillus. The disease mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and the eyes. Untreated, leprosy can cause progressive and permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes. Globally, in 2015, almost 211 000 people were diagnosed with leprosy, equivalent to one every two minutes. 81% of new leprosy patients occur in Brazil, India and Indonesia, which are the most highly endemic countries for leprosy. It is estimated that 1.2 million people are visibly and irreversibly disabled by leprosy. 1 in 11 newly diagnosed leprosy patients are children, indicating Life after leprosy MDT has made it possible to treat patients, reduce transmission and prevent disability. Early detection and prompt treatment is currently the best approach to control the disease NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 201707continued transmission of the disease. INTERRUPTING TRANSMISSION Despite the availability of free MDT drastically reducing the number of leprosy patients over the past 30 years, the number of new patients diagnosed with leprosy has plateaued over the last decade at about 200 000-250 000 per year. In several countries across Asia and Africa, leprosy remains endemic in high-burden pockets. Now, the challenge of covering the last mile to make leprosy history is to interrupt its transmission. Although there are still uncertainties as to how leprosy is transmitted, one of the high risk factors is close and frequent contact with an infectious patient. Once infected, the average incubation period is about 5 years and it can take as long as 20 years for symptoms to appear. Disabilities are secondary complications which result from late diagnosis, when the nerve damage caused by leprosy is already present, or from acute inflammatory reactions that can occur at any stage. MDT has made it possible to treat patients, reduce transmission NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 201708Despite good control, India's high case load is still a cause of worry. Approximately 10 million people are affected in the country and there are more than 750 residential colonies where leprosy patients live NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 2017and prevent disability. Early detection and prompt treatment is currently the best approach to control the disease. Leprosy as a public health problem had been declared eliminated in December 2005 in India, indicating that at a national level there was less than one per 10 000 cases under treatment. Yet, 58.85% of new leprosy cases in the world are in India, and in 2015-2016, 127 334 new cases were detected with around 9% of these being children. Of these, 162 children had Grade 2 disability, indicating visible deformity or damage in the hands and feet and/or severe visual impairment. Despite good control, India's high case load is still a cause of worry. Approximately 10 million people are affected in the country and there are more than 750 residential colonies where leprosy patients live, segregated from society. During the 11th Plan Period (2007 - 2012), the Government of India decided to bring Disability Prevention and Medical Rehabilitation (DPMR) as a major component of the National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) of the Central Leprosy Division, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The Plan was circulated in 2006 and guidelines prepared and circulated the following year. Implementation of these guidelines along with the utilization of funds to facilitate reconstructive surgery has been a massive task. In 2016, NLEP introduced a three- pronged strategy for early detection of leprosy cases: a leprosy case detection campaign for high endemic districts, a focused leprosy campaign for hotspots of low endemic districts and case detection in difficult-to-access areas. Under the first strategy, in a span of 14 days and as a result of house-to-house screening of a population of 360 million, 550 000+ suspected cases were sent for diagnosis. Of these, 34 000 were confirmed cases of leprosy. The second and third strategies are work in progress. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, launched its first Leprosy Case Detection Campaign (LCDC) in March-April 2016, covering 50 districts of seven states Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh. As many as 65 427 suspected cases were identified during this campaign, out of which 4 120 were later confirmed. On September 5, 2016, the Ministry launched its LCDC initiative across 149 districts of 19 states / Union Territories (UTs). The fortnight-long campaign covered 1 656 blocks/urban areas of these districts and aimed at screening 320 million people for leprosy. To achieve this, 297 604 teams comprising one lady Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) worker and one male volunteer visited each home in their allotted areas, screening all family members. The states and UTs covered in this campaign were Haveli, Delhi and Lakshadweep. Included in the campaign were all districts that had a prevalence rate of more than one case per 10 000 population in any of the previous three years. The objective of the campaign was the early detection of leprosy in affected persons so that they could be saved from physical disability and deformity by providing them timely treatment and thus also halting the transmission of the disease at the community level. In continuing efforts to eliminate the disease, the Union Budget for 2017-18 lists elimination of leprosy as a goal for 2018. While experts working in the field say this appears very aspirational, it is an essential - and indeed, achievable - goal, considering that medicine and reconstructive surgery can bring patients back to normal very quickly if the disease is detected early. GOING THE LAST MILE IN LEPROSY For over 30 years, the Novartis Foundation has been working with partners around the world to make leprosy history, including working with experts to develop complementary approaches to interrupting disease transmission. These include early diagnosis and prompt treatment for index patients, screening and post-exposure prophylaxis for people who have contact with newly diagnosed patients, development of new diagnostic tools and surveillance systems that trigger swift intervention. The Novartis Foundation is demonstrating the feasibility of contact tracing around newly diagnosed patients and providing preventative treatment for contact persons. 09NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 201710This approach is being implemented in eight countries from India, Indonesia, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Myanmar to Brazil and Tanzania.Guidelines for this approach are now being considered for integration in the WHO Global Leprosy Strategy. To stop the transmission of leprosy, we will need innovative approaches and tools to accelerate diagnosis. For example, the foundation is using digital health to accelerate the diagnosis of leprosy in the Philippines. Through a public-private partnership, health workers, often in remote areas, send photos of suspected lesions/patches via mobile phone to the leprosy reference center for diagnostic support. In addition, the foundation is partnering with research institutions, such as EPFL in Switzerland and FIOCRUZ in Brazil to initiate the validation of a molecular diagnostic test for leprosy. THE LPEP PROGRAM Novartis Foundation launched the LPEP program in 2014, and it is operational in India, Indonesia, Nepal, Myanmar, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Cambodia. LPEP is designed to evaluate the feasibility of contact tracing and preventative treatment with a single dose of rifampicin (post-exposure prophylaxis or PEP) in pilot areas of these countries, and to determine its impact on leprosy case detection rates. In India, Novartis Foundation and Novartis India partner with Netherlands Leprosy Relief for LPEP. The program will run until 2018 (except in Cambodia where it will finish in 2019). The ultimate goal of LPEP is to integrate its results and lessons learned into national policy to spearhead widespread implementation. Within this program, we also collaborate with the local authorities to strengthen national leprosy surveillance systems, so that they become more action-oriented and include contact tracing and PEP. By building knowledge on the most effective and feasible approach to operationalize contact tracing and LPEP nationwide, we jointly developed practical guidelines for rolling out these activities, so that countries can ensure sustainability and long-term success. By 2020, the Novartis Foundation hopes to have demonstrated success of the interventions being tested as part of their new leprosy elimination strategy, and move them into leprosy programs worldwide. While zero transmission is an ambitious goal, it is an achievable one. WORKING WITH WHO According to Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, World Health Organization (WHO), Regional Director for South-East Asia, \"Enhanced efforts, renewed commitment, and an inclusive approach is needed to end the scourge of leprosy, which continues to afflict thousands of people every year, the majority of them in the WHO South-East Asia Region.\" According to WHO estimates, leprosy affected 212 000 more people globally NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 2017WHO is also developing a new global leprosy strategy for 2016-2020 to detect all cases before disability and achieve zero disability among children11in 2015 - one every two-and-a-half minutes - of which 60% of the cases were in India. Of the new occurrences, 8.9% were children and 6.7% presented with visible deformities. \"Despite being eliminated globally as a public health problem in 2000, leprosy continues to mar the lives of individuals, and impacts families and communities,\" Dr. Singh adds. \"Though present numbers are a fraction of what was reported a decade ago, they are unacceptable, as an effective treatment for leprosy - multidrug therapy, or MDT - has been available since the 1980s and can fully cure leprosy.\" Disabilities do not occur overnight, she explains; they happen after a prolonged period of undiagnosed disease, and early detection is key to achieve this target, alongside scaling up interventions to prevent leprosy transmission. Before the 1960s, the treatment of leprosy consisted of protracted - sometimes even lifelong - use of the drug Dapsone. Patient compliance was an issue; what was worse was that by the late 1960s, M Leprae began developing resistance to Dapsone. It was an Indian scientist - Shantaram Yawalkar - working for Novartis in Switzerland who first thought of taking an MDT approach to treat leprosy, and the search for alternative therapies to Dapsone ended NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 201712in 1981, when WHO mandated that a combination of three drugs Lamprene\u00ae (clofazimine), Rimactane\u00ae (rifampicin) and Dapsone be used as an MDT approach to the treatment of leprosy. WHO introduced MDT in the early 1980s as the main treatment protocol, making it available free of cost in all countries. More than 16 million patients from 125 countries across the globe have been treated with MDT, and this has helped reduce the prevalence of the disease to less than one case per 10 000 population at national levels. According to WHO, the 'robust protocol' of MDT has multiple benefits - an infected person ceases to be infective with just a single dose. The drugs used in WHO-MDT are a combination of rifampicin, clofazimine and Dapsone for MB leprosy patients and rifampicin and Dapsone for PB leprosy patients. After completing an MDT course, the chance of relapse of the disease is barely 0.1%, meaning that of 1 000 individuals treated, only one may get a relapse. Since the year 2000, Novartis has donated more than 56 million MDT blister packs through WHO, helping to treat more than six million leprosy patients worldwide. The current five-year commitment includes donation of treatments worth more than USD 40 million and is expected to reach an estimated 1.3 million patients. The Novartis program has been widely recognized as a successful model for its research, innovation and holistic approach, offering a humane face to the treatment of this age-old disease, and WHO recognizes both Novartis and the Novartis Foundation as 'major partners' in its fight to eliminate leprosy as a public health problem. As WHO points out, two of the drugs used in MDT, clofazimine and rifampicin, originated in the research laboratories of Novartis. Although they were developed back in the 1960s, they are still being used successfully today in the ongoing battle against leprosy, WHO says. Novartis India, which has had a commitment to the cause of leprosy elimination for close to three decades with surgical intervention and socio-economic rehabilitation of people affected with leprosy, has made the disease a focus of its Corporate Responsibility (CR) for the next three years, and longer, if necessary. TOWARD A WORLD WITHOUT LEPROSY The Novartis Foundation has been active in the fight against leprosy for 30 years. Leprosy Alert and Response Network System (LEARNS) is part of the Novartis Foundation's focus on exploring innovative interventions to bring the world closer to the eventual goal of leprosy elimination. The strategy is based on consensus reached by a group of leading leprosy and disease elimination experts, who agree that a successful program requires: Early diagnosis and prompt treatment for all patients Tracing (also known as active screening) and post-exposure prophylaxis for contact persons of newly diagnosed patients Development of new diagnostic tools Action-oriented surveillance systems. LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS In 2010, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a Resolution on the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons affected by Leprosy, accompanied by Principles and Guidelines listing out measures to improve the living conditions of such persons. Additionally, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2007, ('UNCRPD') promotes, protects and ensures the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. India has signed and ratified the UNCRPD, and is also a member of the UN General Assembly that unanimously passed the Resolution on the Elimination of Leprosy. However, for years, it did not act on the move. In April 2015, the Law Commission of India submitted its Report No. 256 on 'Eliminating Discrimination Against Persons Affected by Leprosy' (EDPAL) to the Union Minister of Law and Justice. The model draft law listed various measures against discrimination, NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 2017 Novartis is doing all that it can to make a difference, but it is time to recognize that there is life after leprosy and that patients can live with inclusion and dignity13including the right to healthcare, public transport, housing, land, employment and much more. In January 2017, on the eve of Mahatma Gandhi's death anniversary, Prime Minister Modi did refer to the urgency of the situation when he said the government was making efforts to eliminate leprosy as a tribute to the Father of the Nation. The PM recalled that Mahatma Gandhi had a tremendous concern for people afflicted with leprosy; he wanted them to be accepted into the mainstream of society. \"As a country, we have to leave no stone unturned to not just reach the last mile but also to work together to eliminate the social stigma attached with this disease,\" he added. Dr. Ann Aerts, Head of the Novartis Foundation, agrees. As she said in a recent interview, \"The final elimination of leprosy can't be solved by one person or by one organization alone. Only by working together in partnership can we make a real and lasting impact. With our shared expertise and commitment, I believe we can rid the world of this devastating disease.\" Novartis is doing all that it can to make a difference, but it is time to recognize that there is life after leprosy and that patients can live with inclusion and dignity. For close to 40 years now, leprosy has been treatable; there is no reason for the stigma to persist. NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 2017 14In 1983, when Jayashree P.K. was studying to be a chartered accountant and visiting her alma mater Kendriya Vidyalaya School in Coimbatore as a volleyball and basketball coach, she noticed a light pink patch on her right arm. She thought nothing of it until one day, she held the ball in her forearm, and experienced a dull and heavy ache. A few months later, when the patch had grown too big to ignore, her parents took her to a skin specialist. Jayashree was stunned to discover that she had been diagnosed with leprosy. At this traumatic moment for both Jayashree and her family, what made it worse was that the doctor did not offer any counselling - a fact that left her constantly looking out for a care-giver who could tell her it would be 'okay'. Jayashree was barely 21; she had her life planned out. She would settle in the United States, drive a big car, buy a large house, marry the right man. After her diagnosis, she lost all ambition; what was the point, she felt, of striving for financial success if life could turn upside-down in just a moment? She became a recluse, a social misfit, living in what she perceived as merely a make-believe world. Through the decades, she hid her illness, even from her closest friends. Fortunately for Jayashree, who was one of four siblings, she received tremendous support from her family, especially her older sister Shree, who kept a close eye on her fragile emotional state and rubbished all signs of the stigma attached to leprosy by eating from her plate. Jayashree's parents, although saddened by this situation, stood like rocks guarding her from any possible NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED annual report 2016 - 2017Jayashree's story Jayashree P.K.'s personal experience of leprosy convinced her that the stigma surrounding it is misplaced and that the disease can be easily cured.15discrimination. Their instruction to all her siblings was clear - that Jayashree had to be cared for and supported fully so that she could focus on her chartered accountancy course. None of this unfortunately stopped Jayashree from losing weight and developing several medical complications. For a whole year, she stayed in the cocoon of her home, trying to avoid answering questions from concerned friends on why she looked so different. Meeting Dr. Paul Neelamkavil, a dermatologist in Bengaluru, proved to be a turning point. Dr. Neelamkavil urged her to 'get off the suffering' and encouraged her to help others who had also been affected by leprosy. He introduced her to Sister Mary Mascarenhas of Sumanahalli Leprosy Colony, and around the late 1990s, Jayashree began to talk to others about coping with the disease. She realized that leprosy was a big deal only because people did not speak about it. She also wrote to various organizations worldwide about her experience and realised there was contradictory information about the spread of the illness; that there had been a resurgence even though the authorities claimed it had been eliminated in 2005. A failed marriage and the loss of her sister in a road accident made Jayashree realise it was time to put her past behind and take charge of her life. Her parents had done all that they could for her, and she still had much to achieve. Jayashree turned inwards, on a spiritual journey; when she emerged, she realised she had left her suffering behind. She also recognised how fortunate she had been that she contracted leprosy at the same time that MDT was invented - that Novartis (then Ciba-Geigy) had put together the drugs for her cure. \"I felt a huge sense of gratitude for Novartis and the team that put together my cure, and the cure of millions,\" Jayashree said. Jayashree, who has remarried, has immense support from her husband Jayant Gandhi. He agrees whole-heartedly with her that it is important to talk about leprosy and demystify it - particularly, as she says, because it is a simple disease of no consequence if it is treated in time, and the cure is so readily available. Having co-founded iBAS Consulting Pvt. Ltd. in 2006, Jayashree is now its Chief Executive Officer. She is a trustee, board member and on the advisory board of a few large agencies working for leprosy. She is also an advisor to the Government of India and World Health Organization, working towards favourable policies for the leprosy-affected and removal of the stigma and discrimination that they and their families face. On several occasions she has readily faced the camera for documentaries on the subject - a far cry from the days when she hid herself at home. Jayashree believes that it is important for leprosy patients to realise that they can be cured, and to follow the medication regime. She also urges those with deformities to stand up for their rights, and demand dignity, inclusion and opportunities to earn their livelihood. She feels strongly that government agencies should offer help and guidance to those affected. It is imperative according to Jayashree for care-givers to be trained in empathy. She believes that an empathetic care-giving system will go a long way in encouraging patients to be open about the disease; this will also ensure that a registry of patients is maintained and that follow-ups are done in time. Systems also need to be built for the long-term support of patients. \"I'd like my message of the real and hidden aspects of leprosy - that it's not to be feared; that it's an easily curable disease - to reach out in a bigger and more effective way,\" says Jayashree. \"It's important for the message to go across, and for ongoing research on the cure to continue. \"Let's not forget,\" she adds, \"that typically leprosy affects the poorest of poor who are also ignorant that it's a curable disease and that it's not a curse to have contracted it.\" Jayashree has now dedicated her life to the cause.

The dividend, if approved by the members at the Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\"), will result in a cash outflow of ` 338.7 million including dividend tax. Management Discussion and Analysis For the year under review, the business operations of the Company comprise of Pharmaceuticals. a. Industry structure and developments India's economic growth in terms of GDP , for Financial Year 2016-17, stood at 7.1 percent compared to 7.6 percent during the previous financial year, primarily due to the impact of demonetisation and slowdown in private investments. However, Government's continued commitment towards economic reforms and a slew of measures to support these including the GST Bill and initiatives like 'Make in India', favoured the positioning of India as the fastest growing economy in the world. India's healthcare system remains grossly inadequate to provide care to a population of 1.3 billion, especially in rural areas. With public spending on healthcare at 1.4 percent of GDP , India is among the lowest in the world. Continuing challenges surrounding drug pricing and low health insurance are factors impacting the research based pharmaceutical industry. The Indian Pharma Market (\"IPM\") is valued at ` 1,011 billion (AIOCD, MAT FEB 2017) and forecasted to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11-14 percent* over the next four years. It continues to be a highly fragmented and competitive market with a large number of players spread across therapeutic segments. b. Performance Re venue from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2017 was at ` 6,562.3 million representing a decrease of 4.9 percent over the previous year. Profit bef ore tax for the year from continuing operations was at ` 917.3 million representing a decrease of 17.6 percent over the previous year. novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 201724c. Segment-wise oper ational performance The Phar maceuticals business registered Net Revenue from Operations of ` 6,562.3 million representing a decrease of 4.9 percent over the previous year. Expansion of National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) has led to increase in the scope of drugs subject to price control. Additionally there was a 2.71 percent reduction in prices from April 2016 following a reduction in the annual Wholesale Price Index (WPI) as per the Drugs Price Control Order, 2013 (\"DPCO\"). Both these events continue to have an adverse impact on the operating profits of the Pharmaceutical business. To mitigate the DPCO impact, cost containment measures were undertaken by the Company during the year to protect its operating profit. Follo wing brands hold key positions in major therapeutic areas such as: Therapeutic Area Product Central Nervous System Tegrital\u00ae Pain & Inflammation Voveran\u00ae Transplantation/Immunology Sandimmun\u00ae Neoral\u00ae d. Concerns India is a self-pay market, which coupled with widespread low affordability poses a significant challenge to the pharmaceutical industry in general. Healthcare insurance has still not penetrated in a way so as to make a positive impact on affordability. Control of prices of certain drugs under the DPCO continues to affect the profitability of the pharmaceutical industry. Any attempt to expand the scope of the DPCO will pose additional challenges. The unpredictability of the Patent environment prevalent in the country adds to concerns of the research-oriented pharmaceutical industry. e. Outlook India's economy is well placed to grow at a robust pace over the next five years owing to strong domestic consumption and increase in government spending on infrastructure. Harmonization of the existing, complex tax regime, with proper implementation of Goods & Service Tax (GST) will simplify the supply chain and improve the operating environment and will act as an additional driver of consolidation at all levels of the pharmaceutical market. A lar ge and growing population, low health care penetration, Government's commitment to increase healthcare spend, emerging digital technologies in the healthcare sector, growing preference towards private care all present a growth opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry. Ther e are however, headwinds faced by the Indian Pharma Market (IPM) in the form of continuing price controls and the impending impact if the government makes it mandatory for doctors to prescribe medicines using their generic names. Despite the continued effort at driving productivity and various cost control measures, the Company results continue to be impacted by the severe price cuts. f. Internal control systems and their adequacy The Compan y maintains appropriate systems of internal control, including monitoring procedures, to ensure that all assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. Company policies, guidelines and procedures provide for adequate checks and balances and are meant to ensure that all transactions are authorized, recorded and reported correctly. The Head of Internal Audit together with external audit consultants review the effectiveness and efficiency of these systems and procedures to ensure that all assets are protected against loss and that the financial and operational information is accurate and complete in all respects. The Audit Committee approves and reviews audit plans for the year based 25 novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 2017on internal risk assessment. Audits are conducted on an ongoing basis and significant deviations are brought to the notice of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors following which corrective action is recommended for implementation. All these measures facilitate timely detection of any irregularities and early remedial steps. During the year , the Company conducted a detailed review of its internal control systems, evaluated the internal financial control systems with the Audit Committee and discussed relevant issues with internal and statutory auditors. Based on the recommendations of the Audit Committee, the Board has stated in its responsibility statement that proper internal financial controls were followed by the Company and that such internal financial controls are adequate and were operating effectively. g. Vigil Mechanism The Compan y has established a Vigil Mechanism that enables the Directors and employees to report genuine concerns. The Vigil Mechanism provides for (a) adequate safeguards against victimization of persons who use the Vigil Mechanism; and (b) direct access to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Board of the Company in appropriate or exceptional cases.

The CSR Policy adopted by the Board of Directors is available on the Company's website www.novartis.in. Health: India has around 60 percent of the world's leprosy case load and leprosy continues to be an area of focus for the Company's CSR work in India.

Education: The poor in India continue to be heavily impacted by lack of education with children not being sent to school so that they can contribute to the family income or dropping out of school. The mid-day meal program, when run effectively, has helped bring and keep children in school.

Around 4,450 children in and around Bengaluru are being covered under this programme. The Company has also recognized the need for increasing engagement in the learning of the underprivileged and has contributed towards this by subscribing to educational magazines. Feedback from the recipients is encouraging with there being a marked improvement in spoken and written English, grammar and vocabulary among the students. Sports: India is yet to make a significant mark in the area of sports, particularly at the Olympic level. Focus by parents continues to be on academics for their children making sports a neglected area. The Company continues to support the medical, nutritional and training needs of promising Indian athletes who will participate in future Olympics. Notable among those who fared well at the recently held Olympics supported by the program is badminton player P .V . Sindhu. Environment: The city of Mumbai is starved of open green spaces and the Company has contributed in a positive way by supporting the upkeep of two beautiful gardens close to its Mumbai office. The Company continues to commemorate Community Partnership Week (\"CPW\") each year encouraging employees to work on causes close to their heart. A pan India activity that has shown rising numbers is the blood donation drive for children suffering from thalassemia, a hereditary blood disorder where the body makes an abnormal form of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carry oxygen.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 6. A company' s internal financial controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 7. Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion 8. In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2017, based on the internal controls over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Sh AhANI Firm R egistration No. 301056E Vice Chairman & Managing Director Chartered RAMAN AThAN PartnerMembership NOBLE &Compliance OfficerWhole Time Director & Chief Financial OfficerDIN: 03086192 Mumbai, 23 rd May 2017 Mumbai, 23rd May 201777 novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 2017Corporate Information Novartis India Limited (\"the Company\") is a public limited company listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, incorporated and domiciled in India and has its registered office at Sandoz house , Dr. Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai-400018, India. It is primarily engaged in the business of trading of Drugs and Pharmaceuticals. These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on May 23, 2017. 1. Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. A. Basis of Prepar ation (i) Compliance with Ind AS These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the company has adopted Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as \"Ind AS\") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 with effect from April 1, 2016. Previous period numbers in the financial statements have been restated to Ind AS. In accordance with Ind AS 101 First-time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards, the Company has presented a reconciliation from the presentation of financial statements under Accounting Standards notified under the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006 (\"previous gAAP\") to Ind AS of shareholders' equity as at March 31, 2016 and April 1, 2015 and of the comprehensive income for the year ended March 31, 2016 (refer note 42 for information on how the Company has adopted Ind AS). (ii) historical Cost Con vention The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following: Certain financial assets and financial lia bilities measur ed at f air v alue; Share-based pa yments; and Defined benefit plans - plan assets that ar e measur ed at f air v alue. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Lev el 1 \u2014 Lev el 1 hierar chy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. Lev el 2 \u2014 Valuation techniques for whic h the lowest lev el input that is significant to the fair v alue measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Lev el 3 \u2014 Valuation techniques for whic h the lowest lev el input that is significant to the fair v alue measurement is unobservable. (iii) Curr ent and Non-Current Classification The assets and liabilities reported in the balance sheet are classified on a \"current/non- current basis\", with separate reporting of assets held for sale and corresponding liabilities. Current assets, which include cash and cash equivalents are assets that are intended to be realized, sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the Company. Based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current/non-current classification of assets and liabilities.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2017novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 201778 B. For eign Currency Translation (i) Functional and Presentation Cur rency Items included in the financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates ('the functional currency'). The financial statements are presented in 'Indian Rupees' (`), which is Company's functional and presentation currency. (ii) Tr ansactions and Balances For eign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. C. Property , Plant and Equipment Items of proper ty, plant and equipment acquired or constructed are initially recognized at historical cost net of recoverable taxes, duties, trade discounts and rebates, less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. The historical cost of property, plant and equipment comprises of its purchase price, borrowing costs and adjustment arising for exchange rate variations attributable to the assets, including any cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to their working condition for their intended use. Capital W ork-in-Progress represents property, plant and equipment that are not ready for their intended use as at the balance sheet date. Subsequent costs ar e included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the year in which they are incurred. Tr ansition to Ind AS: On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and equipment recognised as at April 1, 2015 measured as per the previous gAAP and use that car rying value as the deemed cost of the property, plant and equipment. Depr eciation: Depr eciation is calculated over its estimated useful life based on useful life of the assets on Straight Line Method (SLM) as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 except in case of following assets, wherein based on internal assessment and independent technical evaluation, a different useful life has been determined. DescriptionEstimated useful Lif e Years Property, Plant and Equipment Plant and Equipment Serv ers and Networks 3 Quality Control Equipment 5 Electrical Installations 12.5 Others 12.5 vehicles 5 Mobile handsets and Mobile De vices are fully depreciated in the year of purchase. Estimated useful liv es, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed annually, taking into account commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Leasehold Improvements are amortised over the period of lease. Losses arising from retirement and gains or losses arising from disposal of Property, Plant and Equipment are determined by comparing sale proceeds with carrying amount and are included in Statement of Profit and Loss within \"Other Income\"/\"Other Expenses\".Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 201779 novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 2017 D. Intangible Assets (i) Amortisation Method and P eriod The Compan y amortises intangible assets with a finite useful life using the straight-line method over the following period: Tr ade Marks \u2014 5 years Tr ansition to Ind AS On tr ansition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of intangible assets recognised as at April 1, 2015 measured as per the previous gAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of the intangible assets. Losses arising from retirement and gains or losses arising from disposal of Intangible assets are determined by comparing sale proceeds with carrying amount and are included in Statement of Profit and Loss within \"Other Income\" / \"Other Expenses\". E. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets Assets that ar e subject to depreciation or amortisation are tested at each balance sheet date for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's or cash generating unit's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. F. Inventories Inv entories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on moving weighted average basis. Cost of work-in-progress and finished goods includes labour and manufacturing overheads, where applicable. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. G. Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Oper ations Non-curr ent assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement. An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of de-recognition. Non-curr ent assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Non-curr ent assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. A discontin ued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. H. Tr ade Receivable Tr ade receivables are amounts due from customers for sale of goods or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2017novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 201780 I. Cash and Cash Equivalents In the cash flo w statement, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cheques on hand, demand deposits with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. J. Financial Instruments Investments and Other Financial Assets (i) Classification: The Compan y classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensi ve income, or through profit or loss), and those measur ed at amor tised cost. The c lassification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. (ii) Measurement: At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Debt Instruments Subsequent measur ement of debt instruments depends on the Company's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Company classifies its debt instruments: Amortised Cost: Assets that ar e held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at amortised cost is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. Fair value Through Other Compr ehensive Income (F vOCI) Assets that ar e held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at F vOCI. Mo vements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/ (losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. Fair value Through Profit or Loss (F vTPL) Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or F vOCI are measur ed at F vTPL. A g ain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it arises. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income. Equity In vestments The compan y subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the company's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at F vOCI are not r eported separately from other changes in fair value.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 201781 novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 2017 (iii) Impairment of Financial Assets: The Compan y assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For Trade Receivables only, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. (iv) Dereco gnition of Financial Assets: A financial asset is dereco gnised only when: the Company has transf erred the rights to recei ve cash flo ws from the financial asset or retains the contractual rights to recei ve the cash flo ws of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual ob ligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. Wher e the entity has transferred an asset, the Company evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. Where the entity has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised. Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the Company has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Company retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset. Financial Lia bilities Tr ade Payables: These amounts represents obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. These payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less otherwise they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade and payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. K. Revenue Recognition Sale of goods Re venue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed as revenue are inclusive of excise duty and net of discounts, allowances, returns, value added taxes/sales tax and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The company recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities, as described below. Provision is made for the non-sellable returns of goods from the customers estimated on the basis of historical data of such returns. Such provision for non-sellable sales returns is reduced from sales for the year. Sale of Ser vices Service income is accounted as and w hen services are rendered and is net of service tax. Interest Income Interest income is recognised on time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the rate applicable. Commission Income Commission income is recognised in respect of sales made on behalf of consignor when the significant risks and rewards of ownership in the goods are transferred to the buyer and is net of service tax.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2017novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 201782 L. Offsetting Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty. M. Income Tax The income tax e xpense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences. The cur rent income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Defer red income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax credits could be utilized. Defer red tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Defer red tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Curr ent and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. (ii) Contingent Liabilities Contingent lia bilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company. A present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle or reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made, is termed as contingent liability.

For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Standards issued b ut not yet effective In Mar ch 2017, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) (Amendments) Rules, 2017, notifying amendments to Ind AS 7, 'Statement of cash flows' and Ind AS 102, 'Share-based payment.' These amendments are in accordance with the recent amendments made by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to IAS 7, 'Statement of cash flows' and IFRS 2, 'Share-based payment', respectively. The amendments are applicable to the company from 1st April, 2017. Amendment to Ind AS 7 The amendment to Ind AS 7 requires the entities to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes, suggesting inclusion of a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the balance sheet for liabilities arising from financing activities, to meet the disclosure requirement. The compan y is evaluating the requirements of the amendment and the effect on the financial statements is being evaluated. Amendment to Ind AS 102 The amendment to Ind AS 102 provides specific guidance to measurement of cash-settled awards, modification of cash-settled awards and awards that include a net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes. It clarifies that the fair value of cash-settled awards is determined on a basis consistent with that used for equity-settled awards. Market-based performance conditions and non-vesting conditions are reflected in the 'fair values', but non-market performance conditions and service vesting conditions are reflected in the estimate of the number of awards expected to vest. Also, the amendment clarifies that if the terms and conditions of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction are modified with the result that it becomes an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, the transaction is accounted for as such from the date of the modification. Further, the amendment requires the award that includes a net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes to be treated as equity-settled in its entirety. The cash payment to the tax authority is treated as if it was part of an equity settlement. The compan y is evaluating the requirements of the amendment and the impact on the financial statements is being evaluated. 2. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements Preparing the financial statements under Ind AS requires management to take decisions and make estimates and assumptions that may impact the value of revenues, costs, assets and liabilities and the related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Re visions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The Compan y make estimates and assumptions based upon management's evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of financial statements. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is included in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the financial statements.

In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.Expected contributions to post employment benefit plans for the year ending 31 March 2018 are ` 75.8 million.

If bond yields fall, the defined benefit plan will tend to increase.Salary inflation risk \u2014 higher than expected increased in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation. Demographic risk \u2014 This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality, withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligations is not straight forward and depends upon the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important not to overstate withdrawals because in financial analysis the retirement benefit of the short career employee typically costs less per year as compared to a long service employee. Change in leave balances \u2014 This is the risk of variability if the results due to significant variations form expected accumulations from leave balance. All other aspects remaining same, higher than expected increase in leave balances will increase the defined benefit obligations. Medical inflation risk \u2014 higher than increase in premium will lead to increase in defined benefit obligations. Although the risk is mitigated by capping the benefit paid by insurance Company (limiting the premium amount for the Company). Investment return risk \u2014 Lower the expected investment return, higher will be the defined benefit obligation. 31st March 2017 31st March 2016 1st April 2015 in ` million in ` million in ` million Major category of plan assets are as followsunquoted Quoted Total in % unquoted Quoted Total in % unquoted Quoted Total in % go vernment Bonds Investment funds \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Mutual Fund \u2014 17.3 17.3 1% \u2014 10.7 10.7 1% \u2014 0.2 0.2 0% Others \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Public Sector units Bonds \u2014 395.1 \u2014 2.6 2.6 0% \u2014 3.2 3.2 0% \u2014 1.7 1.7 0% Special of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 201797 novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 201716.

The adoption of Ind AS has been carried out in accordance with Ind AS 101, First-time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards. Ind AS 101 requires that all Ind AS standards and interpretations that are issued and effective for the first Ind AS financial statements be applied retrospectively and consistently for all financial years presented. Accordingly, the Company has prepared financial statements which comply with Ind AS for year ended 31 st March 2017, together with the comparative information as at and for the year ended 31st March 2016. The Company's opening Ind AS Balance Sheet has been prepared as at 1st April 2015, the date of transition to Ind AS. In pre paring its opening Ind AS balance sheet, the Company has adjusted the amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with the accounting standards notified under Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006 (as amended) and other relevant provisions of the Act. An explanation of how the transition from previous GAAP to Ind AS has affected the Company's financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in the following tables and notes. A. Exemptions and e xceptions availed In pre paring these Ind AS financial statements, the Company has availed certain exemptions and exceptions in accordance with Ind AS 101, as explained below. The resulting difference between the carrying values of the assets and liabilities in the financial statements as at the transition date under Ind AS and previous GAAP have been recognised directly in equity. This note explains the adjustments made by the Company in restating its previous GAAP financial statements, including the Balance Sheet as at 1 st April 2015 and the financial statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2016. A.1 Ind AS optional e xemptions Set out below are the applicable Ind AS 101 optional exemptions and mandatory exceptions applied in the transition from previous GAAP to Ind AS.

This exemption can also be used for intangible assets covered by Ind AS 38 Intangible Assets. Accordingly, the Company has elected to measure all of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at their previous GAAP carrying value.novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 2017118Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2017 (b) Share based payment tr ansactions Ind AS 101 pro vides an exemption that a first-time adopter is not required to apply Ind AS 102 Share-based Payment to equity instruments that were vested on or before the date of transition to Ind AS. Accordingly, the Company has elected to apply this exemption. A.2 Ind AS mandatory e xceptions (a) estimates An entity' s estimates in accordance with Ind AS at the date of transition to Ind AS shall be consistent with estimates made for the same date in accordance with previous GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any difference in accounting policies), unless there is objective evidence that those estimates were in error.

The Compan y has made estimates for Impairment of financial assets based on expected credit loss model in accordance with Ind AS at the date of transition as these were not required under previous GAAP . (b) Classification and measurement of financial assets Ind AS 101 requires an entity to assess classification and measurement of financial assets (debt instruments) on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist at the date of transition to Ind AS. Consequently, the Company has applied the above assessment based on facts and circumstances existing at the transition date. B.

Under Ind AS, all financial assets are required to be recognised at fair value. Accordingly, the Company has fair valued these security deposits under Ind AS. Difference between the fair value and transaction value of the security deposit has been recognised as prepaid rent. Consequent to this change, the amount of security deposits decreased by ` 9.9 million as at 31 March 2016 (1 April 2015 - ` 14.6 million). The prepaid rent increased by ` 9.3 million as at 31 March 2016 (1 April 2015 - ` 14.3 million). Total equity decreased by ` 0.3 million as on 1 April 2015. The profit for the year and total equity as at 31 March 2016 decreased by ` 0.3 million due to amortisation of the prepaid rent of ` 4.9 million which is partially off-set by the notional interest income of ` 4.6 million recognised on security deposits. Note 2: Impairment of Tr ade Receivables - Expected Credit Loss As per Ind AS 109, the Company is required to apply expected credit loss model for recognising the allowance for doubtful debts. As a result, the allowance for doubtful debts increased by ` 0.2 million as at 31 March 2016 (1 April 2015 - ` 0.2 million). Consequently, the total equity as at 31 March 2016 decreased by ` 0.2 million (1 April 2015 - ` 0.2 million) and profit for the year ended 31 March 2016 decreased by Nil. Note 3: Employee Stock Option Expense Under the pre vious GAAP , the cost of equity-settled employee share-based plan were recognised using the intrinsic value method. Under Ind AS, the cost of equity settled share-based plan is recognised based on the fair value of the options as at the grant date. Consequently, the amount recognised in share option outstanding account decreased by ` 69.4 million as at 31 March 2016 (1 April 2015 - ` 72.7 million). No profit impact on the Statement of Profit and Loss. Note 4: Excise Duty Under the pre vious GAAP , revenue from sale of products was presented exclusive of excise duty. Under Ind AS, revenue from sale of goods is presented inclusive of excise duty. The excise duty paid is presented on the face of the statement of profit and loss as part of expenses. This change has resulted in an increase in total revenue and total expenses for the year ended 31 March 2016 by ` 1.3 million. There is no impact on the total equity and profit. Note 5: Remeasurements of post -employment benefit obligations Under Ind AS , remeasurements i.e. actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in the net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability are recognised in other comprehensive income instead of profit or loss. Under the previous GAAP , these remeasurements were forming part of the profit or loss for the year. As a result of this change, the profit for the year ended March 31 2016 decreased by `2.9 million. There is no impact on the total equity as at March 31, 2016. Note 6: Provision for Cash Discount Under Ind AS , cash discount is recorded net of revenue. Provision has been made for cash discount taking into consideration future estimates and based on past trends. Consequently, the total equity as at 31 March 2016 increased by ` 0.1 million (1 April 2015 - decreased by ` 0.1 million) and profit for the year ended 31 March 2016 increased by ` 0.2 million. Note 7: Assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations The Boar d of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on January 13, 2015 approved the slump sale of the Company's OTC Division to GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Private Limited (\"GSK CPL\"), a private unlisted company incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013. On the basis of the approval received from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, Government of India and the Competition Commission of India the slump sale transaction was completed on 30 th September 2015. The Boar d of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on November 7, 2014 approved the slump sale of the Company's Animal Health Division to elanco India.On the basis of the approval received from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, Government of India and the Competition Commission of India the slump sale transaction was completed on 31 st December 2015. The concept of disposal group held for sale does not exist under previous GAAP . Accordingly, assets and liabilities of disposal group have not been presented as held for sale and appropriately disclosed under respective assets & liabilities held in accordance with previous GAAP . Ind AS 105 \"Non-cur rent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\" requires disposal group to be identified as held for sale, if the carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.123 novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 2017Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2017 Based on Ind AS 105, in the opening balance sheet as on 1st April 2015 the assets and liabilities of OTC and Animal health businesses have been reported as held for sale. Consequently, the assets and liabilities of disposal group held for sale have been presented separately from the other assets and other liabilities respectively in the balance sheet. There is no impact on the total equity or profit as a result of this adjustment. Further, the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operation under Ind AS and previous GAAP in the statement of profit and loss.

Note 9: Other comprehensive income Under Ind AS, all items of income and expense recognised in a period should be included in profit or loss for the period, unless a standard requires or permits otherwise. Items of income and expense that are not recognised in profit or loss but are shown in the statement of profit and loss as 'other comprehensive income' includes remeasurements of defined benefit plans. The concept of other comprehensive income did not exist under previous GAAP .

To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard. Level 1: Lev el 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. Level 2: valuation techniques f or which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3: valuation techniques f or which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. (ii) Valuation technique used to determine f air value Specific valuation tec hniques used to value financial instruments include: For the purpose of Fair valuation of Security Deposits the Company has used general bank borrowing rate prevalent in the market. Security de posits is classified as Level 3 category item under the fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to calculate the Fair value.

The amount of Fair value of Security deposits given and accepted is considered to be insignificant in value and hence carrying value and fair value is considered as same. 44. Financial risk management The Company's activities expose it to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Company's financial risk management is an integral part of how to plan and execute its business strategies. The Company's financial risk management policy is carried out by the treasury team under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Market risk is the loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from the change of a price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables. The Company manages market risk through a treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent control over the entire process of market risk management. The activities of this department include management of cash resources & ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies. (A) Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit risk, which is the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligation resulting in a financial loss to the Company. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables. Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Companies receivables from customers. Tr ade and other receivables Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk, the Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. The Company manages credit risk through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. In further ance to above, the Company has assessed the impact of the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised in respect of Trade Receivables. Historical tr ends of impairment of trade receivables do not reflect any significant credit losses. Given that the macro economic indicators affecting customers of the Company have not undergone any substantial change, the Company expects the historical trend of minimal credit losses to continue.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2017novartis india limited annual report 2016 - 2017126 Reconciliation of loss allowance pr ovision - Trade Receivables Reconciliation of loss allowance in ` million Loss allowance on 1 April 2015 35.0 Changes in loss allowance 16.8 Loss allowance on 31 March 2016 51.8 Changes in loss allowance (3.2) Loss allowance on 31 March 2017 48.6 Credit risk on Cash and Cash equi valents is limited as we generally invest in deposits with banks with high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies. (B) Liquidity Risk Prudent liquidity risk manag ement implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding to meet obligations when due and to close out market positions. Company's treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining sufficient cash and bank balances available to meet the working capital requirements. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company's liquidity position (comprising the unused cash and bank balances along with temporary investments in fixed deposits) on the basis of expected cash flows. This is generally carried out at Company level in accordance with practice and limits set by the Company. These limits vary to take into account the liquidity of the market in which the Company operates. Maturities of financial liabilities The ta bles below analyse the Company's financial liabilities into relevant maturity based on their contractual maturities for all non-derivative financial liabilities. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the Company's functional currency (`). The risk is measured through a forecast of highly probable foreign currency cash flows. The objective of the Company is to minimise the volatility of the ` cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions. The Company actively monitors and seeks to reduce, where it deems it appropriate to do so, fluctuations in these exposures. (i) For eign Currency Risk Exposure: The Compan y has not entered into any derivative transactions during the year and there were no derivative transactions outstanding as on March 31, 2016 and 1st April 2015.
