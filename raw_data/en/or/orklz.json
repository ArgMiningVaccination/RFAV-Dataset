Dr. Cowan is the author of The Fourfold Path to Healing. The main premise of this book is that right diet can heal the physical body while beneficial medicines or therapies work on the life-force body. Adding healing movement and exercise supports the emotional body, and effective thinking activity influences on the mental body. Dr. Cowan has studied Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy, the practices of traditional people, the work of Weston A. Price, homeopathy, herbology, and many other disciplines. I has investigated how water works in the human being, what the heart actually does, and the details of why we get cancer, autoimmune diseases, allergies, and many other ailments. He will be sharing this knowledge in two talks during HMI's [conference](https://holisticmanagement.org/cc/). One talk will focus on why people suffer from heart disease and why they get heart attacks and explain why the current explanations are not only inadequate but divert our attention from the real causes of heart disease. Then he will explain why people do suffer from heart disease and what they can do to prevent or treat this disease. The Next Dietary Revolution - the Role of Vegetables in the Human Diet His other talk will focus on the recent return to a traditional diet pattern and how we can tackle the traditional approach to eating vegetables and some fun ways to bring this activity into your own kitchen and life.
