See our information sheet: [Testing for Immunity to Vaccine-Preventable Diseases.](https://www.sfcdcp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Immunity-Testing-Info-Sheet-18-August-2010-id168.pdf) AITC can check your immunity to: - Hepatitis A - Hepatitis B - Measles / Mumps / Rubella - Chickenpox - Rabies You can be infected with hepatitis B and not know it. AITC offers testing to determine your hepatitis B infection status. See our information sheet: [Testing for Hepatitis B Infection](https://www.sfcdcp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/HBV-Testing-Info-Sheet-18-August-2010-id270.pdf). Consider hepatitis B testing if you answer yes to any of the following: - Were you or your parents born in Asia, Pacific Islands, Africa, Eastern Europe, or the Amazon Basin in South America? - Have you had a sex partner with hepatitis B or lived in the same household as someone with hepatitis B? - Are you a male who has had sex with males? Results are available within 2-5 business days. You may discuss your results with an AITC nurse by phone or in person at no additional charge. There is a cost for each test, plus a small fee to draw your blood. See [prices](https://www.sfcdcp.org/aitc-regular-prices-low-cost-or-free-vaccines/). TB (tuberculosis) Testing TB testing shows whether your immune system recognizes TB or not. Here's how it works: A \"positive\" test result means that your immune system recognizes TB, because you were exposed to TB infection in the past. A positive result does not mean that you have active TB disease right now \u2014 the TB in your body could be either active or inactive. Active TB is bad for your health and contagious to other people, while inactive TB is not. And so, after a positive TB test, you will need further testing to determine whether you have active or inactive TB infection. A \"negative\" test result means that your system does not recognize TB, most likely because you have never been exposed to TB. After a negative result, further testing is usually not needed. AITC offers 2 types of tests for TB. - TB skin testing. This is the traditional (and least expensive) method. It requires 2 visits to clinic. On the first visit, a nurse will place a tiny amount of test fluid in the skin of your forearm using an ultra-thin needle. You will be required to return to the clinic in 48-72 hours to have a nurse read the test by checking the skin of your forearm. TB skin tests are regularly offered Mon, Tue, Wed, and Friday. We do not perform TB skin testing on Thursdays (and on the Friday before a long weekend), as it will not be possible to read the test within 72 hours. - TB testing using the QuantiferonTB-Gold In-Tube (QFT) blood test. This method has 2 advantages: 1) In people born outside the USA who received an anti-TB vaccine called BCG vaccine as children, the QFT test is more accurate than TB skin testing; 2) Just one clinic visit is required for the blood test, and so the QFT can be performed with clients who are unable to return for a second visit. Please note: QFT results are available 3-4 business days after your test. See [prices](https://www.sfcdcp.org/aitc-regular-prices-low-cost-or-free-vaccines/). Please note that TB skin testing is unavailable on Thursdays and on the Friday before a long weekend. Note: If you need a QFT test, please plan to arrive at least 1 hour before closing, as we need time to process your blood sample before our lab closes. Flu Vaccination AITC offers seasonal flu vaccine every year, as soon as vaccine is available (usually late August-early September). We carry many varieties of flu vaccine, and as of fall 2020 all our flu vaccines are quadrivalent (protect against 4 strains of influenza) - Regular and preservative-free flu vaccine - Flu vaccine for seniors age 65 and up (High-dose or Fluad brand) - Nasal spray flu vaccine (FluMist brand) - Egg-free flu vaccine (Flucelvax or FluBlok brand) Pneumococcal Vaccination Vaccination against pneumococcal infection is now part of routine childhood immunization before the age of 2 years. However, most adults today have never received this vaccine. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends vaccination against pneumococcal disease for adults with specific situations: - adults who smoke cigarettes or have asthma, chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes, or a weakened immune system - seniors age 65 years and up (Pneumovax23 for all seniors, plus Prevnar13 for seniors who would like the extra protection) The CDC has [additional information on pneumococcal vaccination](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pneumo/default.htm). Live Vaccines during Pregnancy If you think you need a live vaccine (see list below) for work, school, personal health, or international travel, please take precautions to avoid becoming pregnant before your vaccination, and for at least one month after your vaccination. Here's why: Pregnant women may safely be immunized with vaccines that contain inactivated (killed) viruses or bacteria. Most vaccines are of this type. For example, it is OK to receive whooping cough vaccine (Tdap), a flu shot, or the injection form of typhoid vaccine (Typhim Vi\u00ae) while pregnant. But some vaccines contain live, attenuated (weakened) viruses or bacteria. We generally avoid administering live vaccines to women who are pregnant or who might be pregnant. It is possible, in theory, that the live vaccine strain could infect the fetus. Of all the live vaccines, only the smallpox vaccine has actually been shown to cause injury to the fetus. (We do not administer smallpox vaccine at AITC.) The rest of the live vaccines actually appear to be safe during pregnancy. However, due to the small number of women in the research studies, a bit of uncertainty still remains, and so we are very cautious about administering live vaccines to women who are pregnant or who might be pregnant. Live vaccines given at AITC: - Yellow Fever Vaccine (YF-Vax) - Measles, (MMR) Vaccine - Oral Typhoid Vaccine (Vivotif) - Cholera Vaccine (Vaxchora) We will always ask if you are pregnant before administering any vaccine, but especially before giving you a live vaccine. If you are unsure whether you're pregnant, or if you have had unprotected intercourse since the start of your most recent period, and you need a live vaccine, we may recommend that you wait until your next period starts and document a negative pregnancy test, before administering live vaccine.
