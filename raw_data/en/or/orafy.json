Why hasn't the US eradicated the plague? [ ](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34398099) The Black Death caused about 50 million deaths across Africa, Asia and Europe in the 14th Century. It wiped out up to half of Europe's population. Its last terrifying outbreak in London was the Great Plague of 1665... What is Plague? Is it only a wildlife disease? [ ](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/cir1372) Learn more about plague from USGS Circular 1372. Written for both scholars and the general public, Plague presents information about the disease in a simple, straightforward manner. Sylvatic plague can decimate prairie dog colonies (90% or greater mortality rates), resulting in local extinctions and population reductions. USGS scientists are working with partners to conduct field trials of an oral sylvatic plague vaccine for prairie dogs. This management tool could be used to reduce the occurrence of plague outbreaks in wildlife.
