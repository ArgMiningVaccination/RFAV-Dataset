A bath with one of the best medicated dog shampoos can also treat skin problems from allergies and infections and provide much-needed relief from skin irritation. Medicated dog shampoo can help provide relief quickly and effectively. This type of shampoo is specially formulated with active ingredients like antibacterial agents to treat common skin conditions. Depending on the type and severity of skin problem, you can use these shampoos either alone or in addition to veterinarian-prescribed medications. As a veterinarian, I understand the complexities of skin conditions in dogs. They can be challenging to diagnose and treat, in part because the skin's reactions (redness, itching, flaking) are similar across allergies and infections. There are also many medicated dog shampoos on the market, making it daunting to sift through all the options. For this guide to the best medicated dog shampoos, we evaluated 15 products, according to our veterinarian-informed selection criteria. Even with this curated list of shampoos, you should first visit your veterinarian, who will diagnose your dog's skin condition and recommend a medicated dog shampoo if appropriate. Be aware that a prescription medicated dog shampoo may be the best choice over an over-the-counter (OTC) shampoo. Always follow your veterinarian's instructions for using any shampoo.

Best dog shampoo for skin allergies: 4-Legger Dog Shampoo - [See at Chewy](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_042519_best-medicated-shampoo-for-dogs-20&h=c7690a4dccbde08fac726f5ae9efbde43273ca67bfdcdcc74d2d7070f93d1a51&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f423fa&postSlug=guides%2Fpets%2Fbest-medicated-shampoo-for-dogs&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chewy.com%2F4-legger-organic-hypo-allergenic%2Fdp%2F141857&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) 4-Legger Dog Shampoo uses all-natural ingredients to clean, moisturize, and condition the red, itchy skin of dogs with skin allergies. Pros: Free of soap, treats multiple skin conditions, safe for puppies at least 12 weeks of age, does not remove topical flea and tick treatments Cons: Salicylic acid may dry out the skin The inevitable irritation created by skin problems can make dogs feel miserable and needs to be resolved quickly and effectively. \"A medicated shampoo is used to treat numerous skin conditions, such as bacterial and fungal infections, and allergic disease,\" says Joya Griffin, a board-certified veterinary dermatologist in Louisville, Kentucky. However, just treating the condition isn't enough. The skin also needs moisturizing to be restored to good health. Veterinary Formula Clinical Care Antiparasitic and Antiseborrheic Medicated Dog Shampoo treats multiple skin conditions, including parasitic and fungal infections, seborrhea (greasy, flaky, itchy skin), and general dermatitis (skin inflammation). It also contains oatmeal and allantoin to soothe, hydrate, and heal the skin. The shampoo's ability to treat multiple skin conditions and heal the skin, all at a reasonable price, made it our top choice. The shampoo contains salicylic acid, coal tar, and micronized sulfur, which work together to treat skin infections and reduce seborrhea's symptoms. \"Shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid can be used for seborrheic conditions,\" says Griffin. However, she adds, \"salicylic acid can cause dryness and irritation.\" Free of soap and dyes, this shampoo is safe for puppies at least 12 weeks of age and does not remove topical flea and tick treatments. Pros: Free of soap, treats multiple types of skin infections, reduces itching and flaking, soothes and heals the skin, safe for puppies at least 12 weeks of age, does not remove topical flea and tick treatments, mild scent Cons: Lather is not thick Bacterial skin infections, broadly termed \"pyoderma,\" have several potential causes. These causes include a break in the skin from injury or constant scratching, a change in the skin's normal bacterial population, and excessive moisture on the skin. Veterinary Formula Clinical Care Antiseptic and Antifungal Shampoo contains the antibacterial agent benzethonium chloride to treat bacterial skin infections, along with ketoconazole to treat fungal infections. Many medicated dog shampoos that treat skin infections contain antibacterial and antifungal agents. This shampoo was our top choice for several reasons. For example, it effectively treats both antibacterial and antifungal infections. In addition, the shampoo contains lanolin to reduce skin itching and flaking, as well as aloe vera to soothe and heal itchy and irritated skin. Also, the shampoo does not remove topical flea and tick treatments. To have these positive product characteristics, it impressed us that the shampoo costs less than $10 for 16 oz. Although the shampoo does not lather as thickly as other medicated dog shampoos we reviewed, it has a mild, non-medicinal scent and rinses out easily. It is safe for puppies at least 12 weeks of age. Pros: Contains ketoconazole to treat fungal infections, contains colloidal oatmeal and aloe vera to soothe and moisturize the skin, safe for puppies at least 12 weeks of age, helps heal minor skin injuries, light mint scent Cons: May discolor white fur Fungal skin infections, such as ringworm and yeast dermatitis, occur less commonly than bacterial skin infections in dogs. Our top choice for medicated dog shampoos for fungal infections is Pet MD Medicated Pet Shampoo. Not only does it contain the antifungal agent ketoconazole, but it also contains colloidal oatmeal and aloe vera to soothe and moisturize infected skin that has become itchy and irritated. An additional ingredient, chlorhexidine, is an antibacterial agent that can treat skin conditions like bacterial dermatitis. Chlorhexidine also has antifungal properties, giving the shampoo a slight edge in antifungal activity over [Veterinary Formula Clinical Care Antiseptic and Antifungal Shampoo](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_042519_best-medicated-shampoo-for-dogs-20&h=27dd7dd49b3be9db7995e59d91bfee7679b0f6775c0283d8117cefaff2278616&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f423fa&postSlug=guides%2Fpets%2Fbest-medicated-shampoo-for-dogs&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chewy.com%2Fveterinary-formula-clinical-care%2Fdp%2F43529&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false). In addition to these functions, chlorhexidine can help treat minor skin injuries, such as those caused by superficial cuts and insect bites. Safe for puppies at least 12 weeks of age, the shampoo has a pleasant peppermint scent that can last long after the bath. If you have a white dog, be aware that the shampoo could discolor your dog's fur. Pros: Contains permethrin to kill adult fleas and ticks, oatmeal soothes irritated skin, safe for puppies at least 12 weeks of age, lathers well Cons: May not work for as long as the product label indicates (10 days), scent may not last long Flea and tick control is a cornerstone of responsible pet ownership. Veterinarian-prescribed flea and tick preventatives are the best choice for preventing these pesky parasites, and pet owners should use them as the primary form of flea and tick prevention. Flea and tick shampoos have a role to play, though. Dr. Price, a shelter veterinarian and spay/neuter surgeon, notes that these shampoos can be very effective at killing adult fleas and ticks. Our experts concur, however, that flea and tick shampoos are not good at prevention. \"Flea and tick shampoos have very little residual activity and are not effective in preventing infestations,\" says Griffin. Keeping this in mind, we reviewed several flea and tick shampoos that could complement prescription flea and tick preventatives. Sentry Flea and Tick Shampoo with Oatmeal for Dogs and Puppies earned our top spot for this category, with its quick pest-killing activity, natural oatmeal to heal irritated and itchy skin, and a pleasant ginger scent. The shampoo contains permethrin to kill adult fleas and ticks, including deer ticks. \"Permethrin is a good ingredient to look for in flea and tick shampoos,\" says Price. Unlike pyrethrin, which also kills fleas and ticks, permethrin is safe to use in households with cats (pyrethrin is toxic to cats). This shampoo has some residual activity\u2014up to 10 days\u2014but you should not rely upon this activity as a sole source of prevention. Safe for puppies at least 12 weeks of age, the shampoo lathers well and leaves a dog's coat feeling soft after a bath. Pros: Free of synthetic ingredients, lemongrass has antimicrobial activity, does not remove topical flea and tick treatments, safe for puppies and adult dogs, USDA-certified organic, biodegradable, cruelty free, sustainably sourced Cons: More expensive than other dog shampoos for skin allergies, may feel sticky and leave a residue Skin allergies are common in dogs. Many substances in the environment, such as pollen and dust, can land on a dog's skin and trigger an allergic reaction that causes persistent itchiness. Left unmanaged, skin allergies, which occur either year round or during warm-weather months, can lead to severe skin problems that require intense veterinary care. Dog shampoos for skin allergies, also known as hypoallergenic shampoos, are free of ingredients and fragrances that could worsen or trigger the allergies. 4-Legger Organic, Hypoallergenic, Lemongrass and Aloe Dog Shampoo is our top choice for medicated dog shampoos for skin allergies. As a USDA-certified organic shampoo, it is free of synthetic ingredients. The shampoo's natural ingredients, including aloe vera and essential oils, work together to provide effective relief for itchy and irritated skin caused by allergies. The shampoo's lemongrass has natural antimicrobial activity. The shampoo is safe for puppies and adult dogs and has a light, non-medicinal scent. Although the shampoo is pricey, we believe that it is well worth the higher cost, given that it contains 100% natural ingredients, and has the added antimicrobial activity provided by the lemongrass. The other shampoos we evaluated for this category do not contain ingredients that can also treat skin infections. We asked our two veterinary experts to provide their clinical expertise on medicated dog shampoos. They gave their insight on indications for medicated dog shampoo and how the active ingredients in these shampoos work to treat various canine skin conditions. We also researched basic information about common skin conditions in dogs, including infections, allergies, and parasitic infestations, such as mites, fleas, and ticks. These are the selection criteria that we used to evaluate the shampoos and select our top choices: Skin conditions in dogs can be challenging to diagnose and treat, so it is no surprise that pet owners often have many questions about their dogs' skin issues. With the help of our experts, we came up with common questions about skin problems in dogs and medicated dog shampoos. Of the many OTC medicated dog shampoos very few contain the active ingredients available in prescription dog shampoos to treat skin infections effectively, according to Griffin. \"Without clinical studies to back up the efficacy of OTC medicated dog shampoos, these shampoos can be a 'hit or miss' regarding having the right combination of active ingredients to be effective,\" Price added. \"Most OTC anti-itch shampoos do not contain the ingredients, such as hydrocortisone and pramoxine, that most effectively combat the itch,\" says Griffin. She adds, \"these shampoos don't have much long-term residual anti-itch activity, making frequent bathing necessary.\" Our experts agreed that flea and tick dog shampoos effectively kill live fleas and ticks but are not good at flea and tick prevention. Griffin noted it is a common misconception to bathe dogs only infrequently (e.g., once a month). You can bathe dogs several times a week, or even daily, if needed. More frequent bathing can shorten the time to see therapeutic results and would not dry out the skin, if the shampoo contains high-quality ingredients. A medicated dog shampoo must stay on the skin for at least 5 to 10 minutes to be most effective. Griffin advises owners to apply the shampoo all over, paying particular attention to the problem areas. After this time frame, thoroughly rinse the shampoo with clear, lukewarm water. Medicated dog shampoos rarely work overnight and are most effective when used according to a veterinarian's instructions. \"Consistency is key in achieving therapeutic benefit,\" says Griffin. Price adds that it may be necessary to use the shampoo for one to two weeks before seeing significant improvements, such as healed skin lesions and reduced redness and itchiness. If a dog's skin condition isn't getting better or worsens, Price advises discontinuing the shampoo and contacting your veterinarian. It depends. \"In some conditions, such as seborrheic skin problems, a medicated shampoo can be used alone to provide therapeutic benefit,\" says Griffin. \"Additional medication,\" notes Price, would be needed for deep skin infections, a severe inflammatory response, and chronic skin conditions that cause persistent inflammation.\" A pet owner's ability to clearly describe a dog's skin condition helps a veterinarian diagnose the problem and develop a treatment plan. \"A pet owner may come in and say, 'My dog has a rash,' which is not very helpful in diagnosing the condition,\" says Price. Our experts suggested a few skin-related terms that are helpful for pet owners to know: Antimicrobial: an agent that kills or stops the growth microorganisms Atopy: skin allergies Chlorhexidine: antimicrobial agent Crusts: scab; can be composed of dried Seborrhea: overproduction of sebum from the skin's sebaceous glands, causing the skin to become greasy, scaly, flaky, red, and itchy Sign up for [Insider Reviews' weekly newsletter](https://www.businessinsider.com/subscription/newsletter/insider-reviews) for more buying advice and great deals.
