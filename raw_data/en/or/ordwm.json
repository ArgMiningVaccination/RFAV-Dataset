He is an affiliate professor in the Department of Bioengineering at George Mason University. Dr. Shah's interests include the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) and the integration of physical medicine techniques with promising integrative approaches to the management of myofascial pain and dysfunction. He and his co-investigators at the NIH and George Mason University have utilized novel microanalytical and ultrasound imaging techniques that have uncovered the unique biochemical milieu, viscoelastic properties and blood flow abnormalities of active (i.e., spontaneously painful) MTrPs and surrounding soft tissue. They have published many papers on these topics. In addition, he serves as an associate investigator in the NIH's Chronic Pelvic Pain protocol and Fanconi's Anemia protocol. Dr. Shah is a well-known lecturer on the evaluation and treatment of chronic myofascial and musculoskeletal pain and the application of non-pharmacologic techniques including dry needling, electrical stimulation and acupuncture. He is intrigued by the likely roles that neurogenic inflammation, sensitization, somato-visceral and viscero-somatic reflexes, limbic system dysfunction, and neuroplasticity play in the initiation, amplification and perpetuation of Myofascial Pain Syndrome. He has given many invited lectures and hands-on courses nationally and internationally for physicians, physiotherapists, dentists, chiropractors, massage therapists, and acupuncturists among other professional groups. His presentations integrate the fascinating knowledge emerging from the basic and clinical pain sciences in order to improve evaluation and management approaches to neuro-musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction. Dr. Shah was selected by the American Academy of Pain Management as the 2010 recipient of the Janet Travell Clinical Pain Management Award for excellence in clinical care and by the National Association of Myofascial Trigger Point Therapists as the 2012 recipient of the David G.
