Institutional Effectiveness Changes within Unit: In an effort to escalate and sustain Assessment and Research -related capacity in the Division of Student Life, Assessment On -Boarding is offered monthly during the fall and spring semester and in summer June and July. Progress: Completed 41 Center for Student Engagement I. Mission/Introduction Essential Function(s) of depart ment: Student Engagement exists to support opportunities that create a vibrant, safe, and engaged student experience that complements the academic mission of Georgia Tech. Applying a student -centered approach for students to develop and clarify identity, t o work collaboratively with their peers, and to promote the development of a positive campus community, Student Engagement staff are educators committed to holistic, co - curricular learning and building supportive advising relationships with student leaders and student organizations. Guided by the values of collaboration and inclusivity, Student Engagement strives to contribute to the development of globally minded leaders prepared to engage and make change in their communities. Following a reorganization of the Division of Student Life in 2015, Student Engagement (formerly Leadership and Civic Engagement) was expanded and renamed to include the following areas: Civic Engagement, Fraternity & Sorority Life, Student Media, and Student Organizations. Included i n this report are the areas of Civic Engagement, Student Organizations, and the general Center for Student Engagement. Progress: Completed I. Staffing Current Staff: Center for Student Engagement Staff : Gerome Stephens, Ph.D. serves as the Associate Dean of Students and Director for the Center for Student Engagement.

They previously served as the Administrative Professional to Student Engagement from July 5, 2016 - July 31, 2017. 43 Progress: Completed III. Policy/Procedure New or Changed Policy/Procedure: Student Organizations OrgSync & Engage Since its launch in Spring 2016, OrgSync has brought a dramatic and benevolent shift to the management and active archiving of key student organization data; this inc ludes the Annual Registration process (wherein organizations update and renew their status for the academic year to include officer and advisor details), the Charter Process (wherein student leaders complete the process to become recognized as a Registered Student Organization), and Event Management (to include risk management processes such as digital waiver collection and attendance tracking). In academic year 2018 -19 (the 3rd academic year since launch), we worked to both ameliorate and augment components of these key processes. This included: Reviewing and revising student organization categories to more closely align Student Government Association (SGA) Joint Finance Committee and Joint Campus Organizations Committee policies with organization 's stated purpose/mission Launching the Positions tool to facilitate tracking of Officer transitions in Registered Student organizations (RSOs) Assisting with development Fraternity & Sorority Life umbrella portal to construct annual registration process f or FSL groups and to increase organization compliance Advising SGA's Joint Campus Organization Committee (JCOC) on potential policy updates to better reflect both current Institutional practices related to chartering, registration, and org maintenance and to reflect best practices in the field. Institute -Wide Student Organizations Policy In addition to existing policies, the Center for Student Engagement (CSE) team continued a year -long project of creating a Institutionally -based Student Organizations Policy. With the direct support and influence from Enterprise Risk Management, Legal Affairs, and Insurance, CSE worked with other RSO stakeholders to develop the policy; those contributors include: Campus Recreation Center's Competitive Sports Office, Office of Human Resources, Student Activities Committee, Youth Programs Compliance Specialist, Vice President & Dean of Students, and advisor stakeholders in areas of anticipated heavy impact (i.e., Student Competition Center, Invention Studio). 44 In June 2019, t he policy draft was reviewed and approved by the Policy Steering Committee. As of July 2019, the policy draft will next undergo minor revisions, be published for public comment, and finally submitted to the President for review. Significant areas of the p olicy include: Definition of an Advisor Set standard expectations for all RSO advisors (e.g., advisors must have supervisor approval, must meet twice/academic year with RSO leader) Definition of a Registered Student Organization (RSO) Creation of Departme ntal designation for identified RSOs Resolved concerns regarding contract signatures Standardized organization chartering and annual registration requirements (i.e., must have advisor, must have 10 members, must maintain 2 officers, etc.) SGA's Joint Vice President (JVP) of Campus Organizations & Presidents Council Governing Board (PCGB) Over the course of 2018 -19, the SGA JVP of Campus Organizations and Executive Chair of President's Council Governing Board undertook the goal of merging the PCGB structure with SGA's JVP Campus Organizations structure. As these groups independently held similar roles and responsibilities, and as the energy and influence of these groups independently had grown increasingly stagnant over the past few years, these leaders made a strategic decision to merge the two groups. The new JVP Campus Organizations structure is outlined in the table below. PCGB has been dissolved, and their two primary committees designated under the JVP Campus Orgs. New JVP Campus Organizations Structure JVP Campus Organizations Joint Campus Org. Committee (JCOC) Campus Collaborations Organization Development 1 Chair 1 Chair Co-Chairs Civic Engagement While the Assistant Director for Civic Engagement has previously partnered with the Office of International Education (OIE) to identify and collaboratively support service - based student organizations that travel internationally, the 2017 -2018 academic year introduced a new process for tracking and registering the student organizations. The Assistant Director for Civic Engagement notifies OIE staff of known upcoming international travel by student organization and serves as a liaison between the Center for S tudent Engagement and OIE staff. This process involves connecting OIE and the 45 student organization leader(s) and informing the students of the requested paperwork for the Dean on Call (i.e. trip roster, Group Service Trip Form) as well as the OIE Travel Registry. OIE's new online international travel registry process requires each individual traveling as part of a student organization to register in the system. OIE verifies that all members of the trip have registered by verifying against the trip roster an d then OIE purchases trip insurance for the students. This new process is now electronic, streamlines the tracking process, and reduces duplication of requested material from student organizations. OIE is also able to pull a report with the information of the respective groups that are traveling at any given time. Progress: Completed IV. Significant Accomplishments Unit Description: Student Engagement exists to support opportunities that create a vibrant, safe, and engaged student experience that complements the academic mission of Georgia Tech. Significant Accomplishments: Civic Engagement A major accomplishment in 2018 was the third iteration of the EngageATL extended orientation program in collaboration with the Center for Serve -Learn -Sustain. EngageATL is a four -day, three -night community service based extended orientation program where participants are immersed in Georgia Tech and Atlanta with a specific focus on building sustainable communities through direct service with local organizations. 16 new students participated in the program along with six student leaders and two EngageATL student assistants. In addition to three direct service projects with West Atlanta Watershed Alliance and two programs under the Atlanta Community Food Bank: Tape stry Community Garden and Southwest Ecumenical Emergency Assistance Center (SWEEAC) Mobile Food Pantry. The program engaged three on -campus partners: Office of Government & Community Relations, Office of Sustainability, and our co -sponsor, the Center for S erve-Learn -Sustain. The program connected participants with service -minded peers and helped them build relationships on campus and in the community while promoting a positive and successful transition to Georgia Tech. The 2019 MLK Day of Service was plann ed and implemented under the leadership of the Tech Temp of the Civic Engagement Staff with support from Sirocus Barnes of Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC). Additionally, the Tech Temp of the Civic Engagement S taff led the planning and implementation of the MLK Sunday Supper. The Center for Serve -Learn -Sustain and the Office of Special Scholarships - specifically the Stamps President's Scholarship 46 program - each co -hosted a service project as well. 136 participa nts engaged in three different service projects: Clyde Shepherd Nature Preserve, Trees Atlanta, and West Atlanta Watershed Alliance. The 6th annual MLK Sunday Supper event once again included facilitated small group conversations over dinner and dessert. Guest facilitators moderated small group discussions among the over 40 attendees, which included students, staff, and faculty. The 2019 program was again intentionally capped at 50 attendees in order to better facilitate meaningful and focused small group discussions. Over $3000 was allocated to eight community service projects from the Class of 1981 Public Service Endowment Fund. These projects represented six student organizations: Alternative Service Breaks (ASB) - ASB Fall Break, ASB Spring Break, ASB Summer Break Junior Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) - Step Into STEM Mobilizing Opportunities for Volunteer Experience (MOVE) - Into the Streets Day of Service Physician Assistant Club (PAC) - Coffee and Donuts Networking Social Tech the Hal ls - Tech the Halls event Volunteers Around the World (VAW) - Guatemala Medical Outreach Trip Alternative Service Breaks The Alternative Service Breaks (ASB) student organization hosted 12 Alternative Break trips during the 2018 -2019 academic year, which m atches the record number of trips hosted in one year. The 12 trips included four fall break trips, one winter break trip, six spring break trips, and one summer break trip. Two trips were international trips and one trip took place outside of the domestic southeastern United States. A total of 122 student participants, 22 student leaders, 12 staff advisors, and six student advisors served across the 12 trips. (In the absence of a staff advisor on a trip, ASB Executive Board members served as student advisor s). ASB continued to benefit from its funding from the Strategic Advisory Planning Group (SPAG). In its third year (of a five year allocation process), ASB received $5,000 to support international ASB trips. This money supported the cost of the internatio nal flights for the two ASB spring break trips, which helped reduce the cost per participant. Of the 12 trips, three trips introduced a new partnership and a new location for ASB. Asheville, NC - Asheville Area Habitat for Humanity (Fall Break) Birmingh am, AL - The Central ARC of Alabama & The Exceptional Foundation (Fall Break)* Cherokee, NC - National Parks Service (Fall Break) Savannah, GA - The Humane Society of Greater Savannah (Fall Break)* Wilmington, NC - Community Collaborations, Int'l (Winter Break) Biloxi, MS - Community Collaborations, Int'l (Spring Break) Denver, CO - GRID Alternatives (Spring Break)* Jacksonville Beach, FL - Beaches Habitat for Humanity (Spring Break) Maryville, TN - Once Upon a Time (Spring Break) Medina Bank, Belize - 7 Elements (Summer Break) 47 Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic - Outreach360 (Spring Break) Kissimmee, FL - Give Kids the World (Summer Break) * New service partner Mobilizing Opportunities for Volunteer Experience (MOVE) MOVE's annual Into the Streets day of s ervice for new students engaged 50 students across four projects with four community partners: The Gateway Center, Atlanta Habitat for Humanity, Historic Oakland Foundation, and South Fork Conservancy. As in previous years, Into the Streets collaborated wi th Atlanta Habitat for Humanity to host a full-day Habitat build as one of the service project options. The other three projects occurred from 9:00am -12:00pm. MOVE's Board of Directors partnered with a Student Life Development staff member to implement the new funding proposal created by the previous executive leadership of MOVE. The new proposal requests $10,000 of the Parents Fund yearly available funds to be allocated to MOVE in order for MOVE to distribute to service -based student organizations and comm unity service programming. The approval by the Parents Advisory Board occurred in late fall, which allowed MOVE to host its pilot program during spring 2019. For the pilot, it was determined that MOVE would receive $5000 from the Parents Fund. In its first semester, MOVE allocated $3076.11, which supported four student organization's service projects: Alternative Service Breaks - ASB Dominican Republic trip o $1000 to support the Outreach360 program fee Books Not Bombs - Tutoring with International Rescue Com mittee at Clarkston High School o $750 for background checks Tech Beautification Day (TBD) - Tech Beautification Day of Service o $1000 for t -shirts Lambda Sigma - Bus Driver Appreciation Day o $426.11 for supplies, including cards and items for gift bags Throughout the year, MOVE's six committees hosted small scale service projects: Animal Welfare, Hunger and Homelessness, Medical Assistance, STEM and Education, Sustainability, and Special Projects. JumpStart Beginning in August of 2019, Jumpstart implemen ted a pilot program that introduced a new division of labor from the former Site Manager position into three new roles: a Volunteer Manager, a Quality Coach, and a Program Coordinator. Although recruitment began in August, the Quality Coach position in Atl anta was not filled until mid -October, which delayed the start of Jumpstart training. The program also experienced several 48 staff transitions during the fall semester and early spring semester. Despite these challenges facing the Jumpstart Program during th e 2018 -19 academic year, there were still accomplishments to note. After coming to work with Georgia Tech in January, Interim Volunteer Manager and Quality Coach, Elyssa Baker, formed pairs of Corps Members to serve over 50 children in three Pre -K classroo ms. As of June 4, 2019, the Jumpstart staff team recruited 8 AmeriCorps members. Six of the Jumpstart Corps Members were Federal Work Study (FWS) students, which aided the Institute in meeting its FWS service goals. This academic year, Jumpstart Corps Memb ers have completed over 1,025 hours of service to date and are expected to serve a total of 2,100 hours of service by the end of Jumpstart's fiscal year on August 31st. Student Organizations OrgSync & Engage As in 2017, the continued development and growth of OrgSync at Georgia Tech remains a key focus of the Center for Student Engagement; this work also reveals a number of significant accomplishments in 2017 -18. OrgSync at Georgia Tech launched in 2016 with three campus partners: Student Engagement (including a Civic Engagement tracking platform), Serve -Learn -Sustain, and Parent & Family Programs. Over the past academic year, we have grown Georgia Tech's commitment to and appreciation of OrgSync. This is best evidenced by the addition of yet another new campus partner to the system. As of July 2019, the structure is as follows: Student Engagement Stamps President Scholars Serve -Learn -Sustain Living Learning Communities (new 2018) Fraternity & Sorority Life ( new 2018) Center for Academic Enrichment (new 2019) In addition to day -to-day management of the OrgSync system, we also facilitated the transition of OrgSync to its successor, Campus Labs' Engage. For more than a decade, OrgSync and Campus Labs independently delivered unique and innovative technology to help colleges and universities increase student engagement. Campus Labs , the parent company of Engage , purchased OrgSync in 2015. Data transfer Facilitating group transition trainings for Umbrella holders Assisting with development Fraternity & Sorority Life umbrella portal to construct annual registration process for FSL groups and to increase organization compliance Advising SGA's JCOC on potential policy updates to better reflect both cu rrent Institutional practices related to chartering, registration, and org maintenance and to reflect best practices in the field. 49 Presidents' Summit Presidents' Summit (or P -Summit) is a leadership development and training conference that brings together the top leaders of student organizations at Georgia Tech. The day is filled with collaboration, training, information, and preparation for the upcoming school year. Modules cover topics that will be beneficial to all organizations such as navigating memb er recruitment and retention as well as the SGA budget process. For the past few years, Presidents' Summit has been largely student organized. In 2018, participants numbered around 75 students and the sessions were organized in a loose conference - style, wi th participants choosing which presentations would be most successful for their personal leadership journey. Modules included presentations such as: How to plan a successful event, OrgSync 101, Building an Organization from the Ground Up, How to Run Meetin gs, and Student Organization Finances. Student Leader Retreat Taking place at the beginning of each Spring semester for the last 15 years, the Student Leader Retreat (SLR) is a 2 day program that strives to create a space where Georgia Tech students can practice their leadership skills by collaborating with other organizations and administrators in order to develop relationships to better serve their constituents. Student Leader Retreat provides a forum for student leaders, staff, and faculty to engage i n meaningful dialogue around campus issues and initiatives. In 2019, the Student Leader Retreat worked with leadership facilitator Michael Miller to explore issues and practices for which student leaders at Tech continually request support and training. The retreat focused on personal leadership development skill building as well as strategies for taking responsibility for a student organization's long - term, sustainability and growth. Our goal is to work together to explore your own leadership path an d the way you may be more effectively engaging passionately with your student organization. The retreat will explore questions like: How can I build strategies to lead sustainable change for my student origination? How may I better manage issues of members hip engagement? How can I make my organization more open environment for new members? As a result of attending the Student Leader Retreat, 100% of participants who completed a post -event survey Agreed or Strongly Agreed that they feel more connected to th e community of student leaders at Tech; 98% of participants Agreed or Strongly Agreed that they feel more confident to \"step up\" into other leadership roles at Tech or after graduation. We are proud to share the following reflections from survey participan ts: \"As a leader, showcase your vulnerability and encourage your members to be vulnerable and honest, too.\" \"I understand that leaders are not born. Leadership skills can be learned. With the activities [at the Retreat], I came to believe that every person can become a leader, provided they invest in themselves and have instructors like Michael (retreat facilitator).\"It is important to understand the psychology of every individual on your executive board to effectively manage.\" Progress: 50 Completed V. Statistics Unit Statistics: Civic Engagement Alternative Service Breaks (ASB) expanded its trip offerings by hosting three new trips; each trip included a new location and new community partner. The new locations and partnerships included two fall break trips: Birmingham, AL (The Central ARC of Alabama and The Exceptional Foundation) and Savannah, GA (The Humane Society of Greater Savannah) as well as one spring break trip: Denver, CO (GRID Alternatives). The Denver trip was ASB's first trip to Colorado . A total of 22 student leaders, 122 student participants, 12 staff members, and six student advisors participated across the 12 trips. Listed below is specific participation data from the 12 trips. Asheville, NC - Asheville Area Habitat for Humanity (Fall Break) o 2 student leaders, 1 staff advisor, 11 student participants Birmingham, AL - The Central ARC of Alabama and The Exceptional Foundation (Fall Break)* o 2 student leaders, 2 staff advisors, 10 student participants Cherokee, NC - National Parks Service (Fall Break) o 2 student leaders, 1 staff advisor, 9 student participants Savannah, GA - The Humane Society of Greater Savannah (Fall Break) o 1 student leader, 0 staff advisor, 2 student advisors, 9 student participants Wilmington, NC - Community Collaborations, Int'l (Winter Break) o 2 student leaders, 0 staff advisors, 2 student advisors, 12 student participants Biloxi, MS - Community Collaborations, Int'l (Spring Break) o 2 student leaders, 1 staff advisor, 10 student participants Denver, CO - GRID Alternatives (Spring Break)* o 1 student leader, 1 staff advisor, 10 student participants Jacksonville Beach, FL - Beaches Habitat for Humanity (Spring Break) o 2 student leaders, 2 staff advisors, 14 student participants Maryville, TN - Once Upon a Time (Spring Break) 51 o 2 student leaders, 0 staff advisor, 1 student advisor, 11 student participants Medina Bank, Belize - 7 Elements (Spring Break) o 2 student leaders, 2 staff advisors, 12 student participants Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic - Outreach360 (Spring Break) o 2 student leaders, 2 staff advisors, 12 student participants Kissimmee, FL - Give Kids the World (Summer Break) o 2 student leaders, 0 staff advisor, 1 student advisor, 6 student participants ASB also received $5,000 in State Public Affairs Gr ant (SPAG) funding this academic year, which helped ASB reduce the cost of its international spring break trips. The 2018 - 2019 academic year marks the end of year three of a five -year funding cycle from the SPAG allocation. Student Organizations Organi zation Data As of July 2019, Georgia Tech has 577 Registered Student Organizations. Their categorization is as follows: 17-18 18-19 Category 79 98 Community Service 8 9 Competitive 41 44 Competitive Sports 48 55 Cultural 5 7 FLOs 59 58 Greek Chapters 23 22 Honor Society 10 11 Political 39 39 Production/Performance/Publication 155 172 Professional/Departmental 60 74 Recreation/Leisure 40 46 Religious/Spiritual 52 The categories of Community Service, Cultural, and Recreation/Leisure saw the largest growth in AY 2018 -19. Chartering Organizations To ensure a smooth and expedient experience, the Coordinator for Student Organizations revised the structure of the Chartering Process (the process by which a student group becomes a Registered Student Organization) by limiting the number of possible opportunities to initiate the charter process. While previously the charter process may include up to 8 trainings (the first mandatory step in the chartering process), the new structure restricts the chartering period to 4 possible windows with one training per window. Using a cohort model, the organizations which enter into each window are held to the timeline of that window. This process, overall, provides student leaders with a clearer and more tan gible timeline for their chartering experience and also alleviates confusion and administrative delays in processing chartering paperwork. Each window is limited to 15 organizations, allowing no more than 60 organizations to charter per semester. In Spring 2019, this new system was implemented. Of 4 charter trainings provided, 39 organizations proceeded to the second step of the chartering process: submitting the New Organization Charter Form. 28 RSOs completed the process in the Spring semester, with a num ber set to complete the process in Fall 2019.

The appointed person for the position will be able to use these resources to develop best practices and recommendations to the council through workshops and consistent updates. Educational Initiatives The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life provides programming to the community and individual chapters on a variety of topics, although the majority center on risk management education. Programs this year included: 62 Recruitment and Risk Management Workshops - The office conducted four recruitment and nine risk management education workshops for both IFC and CPC chapters. Sessions focused on values congruence and establishing relationships through social excellence as modern methods of recruiting and alcohol re lated event management or anti -hazing. Greek Advance is the program that serves as the launching point for engaging newly elected student leaders; this year's focus was to increase individual leadership capacity. The program began with a keynote from Tim Mousseau, a motivational speaker that presented \"Fewer Leaders, More Innovators.\" The overall program was one and a half days that took place on January 25th and 26th. Additional sessions included Organizational Student Conduct, values and ritual congrue nce, recruitment, community building, conflict resolution, and open space technology. A number of campus partners were recruited to serve as small group facilitators this year. Greek Peer Education occurred in August and January and engaged the new memb ers of the Interfraternity Council and the Collegiate Panhellenic Council with valuable knowledge about their commitment to their organization and the responsibilities that come with their membership.

That discussion was followed by campus partners in Health Initiatives and GTPD to encourage the use of their new knowledge with their on -campus resources. There is one session held in the spring to mirror the education that is given at the fall workshops. This helps to get the education to new members that join the FS community during spring recruitment or who were unable to attend any of the fall sessions. New Member Orientation for MGC and NPHC occurs at the end of both fall and spring semesters. It was implemented to help build a better community amongst the chapters, but also help incoming members in the chapter to form a relationship with the governing council.

Significant changes are made to the c urriculum each year to enhance the experience and learning outcomes for students. The training provided an introduction to the issue of sexual violence, the influences of alcohol, a brief overview of advocacy and response at Georgia Tech, and a foundation of basic information needed to assist someone in need of support. Approximately 400 students attended one of the trainings hosted this year. Greek Allies was held a total of four times throughout this year with approximately 20 fraternity & sorority mem bers in each. They were trained on creating open and inclusive spaces for their members and in the general Georgia Tech community. Additionally, a new support group for LGBTQ fraternity and sorority members, PILLAR (Greek Support Group for LGBTQ), was la unched in partnership with the LGBTQ Resource Center. The Academic Success Program was created to provide support for students in NPHC and MGC who have an overall and term GPA that falls below a 2.5 GPA. This program is in collaboration with the Center f or Academic Support. The program will provide intentional and consistent support over the course of the semester and/or until there is a significant improvement in the students overall grade point average. Since the creation of the program, over 25 student s within MGC and NPHC have participated and both councils have seen consistent improvement on an individual level and a community level. Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR) (Suicide Intervention and Awareness Training/Education) was held once each month thr oughout the spring semester on a rotating schedule among the Greek facilities. This was a student supported initiative following the events that took place on campus throughout the fall semester and a general increased awareness of mental health concerns, lack of resources among the student body. Greek and Religious Neighborhood Association (GRNA) The GRNA helps to regulate facility maintenance and upkeep of the 38 physical properties through community accountability. The GRNA seeks to provide incentives for chapters who keep their facilities up to standards, and will continue with punitive measures for those groups that do not follow agreed -upon expectations. The group fosters greater community and campus relations, and organizes facilities -related progra ms within the Greek Sector. The GRNA body is comprised of the house manager from each fraternity and sorority that owns or resides in a facility. The Co -Chairs of the G RNA are appointed by the IFC and CPC, and serve an annual term. The GRNA assumes 64 a duty and responsibility to: develop and enforce institute policies and sanctions; advise on programs for sustainability efforts in the Greek community; develop positive incentives; and plan and coordinate GRNA meetings once a month throughout the fall and sprin g semesters. House checks are performed throughout the week by the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life (OFSL) staff to check on dumpster, lawn, and trash maintenance. If any GRNA violations are found or reported by another campus department (ie. facilit ies) our staff immediately notifies the house managers in order to have the issues addressed in a timely manner. Greek Sector Delta Sigma Phi and Alpha Epsilon Pi both opened new chapter facilities in August of 2018. Our newest sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta is 80% complete with their construction as of this report and due to open August 2019. This will add 43 additional bed spaces to the community. Greek and Religious Neighborhood Association (GRNA) guideline violations (i.e. maintenance and upkeep of trash removal, dumpsters, and lawn care): o Approximately $370 was collected in fines, primarily Dumpster Violations In order to support the facilities in the Greek Sector, partnerships with Solid Waste Management and Recycling, Parking, Facilities, Real Est ate, OIT, GTPD/GT Fire Marshal, Student Center Post Office and Environmental Health and Safety were sustained. Bed Count: To date, there are 1,092 beds that can be filled throughout the Greek sector which amounts to approximately 36% of the fraternity and sorority community.

With significant growth within the community, staffing and stu dent leadership changes, and dated directives from previous GT leadership, the relationship was fractured and numerous ongoing issued around dumpsters and trash had led to the City of Atlanta to issue citations to Georgia Tech on behalf of individual chapt ers. As a result, a new Memorandum of Understanding was created and approved by all parties that redefined the relationship and 65 expectations of all parties as it relates to trash management and dumpster operations. The Memorandum of Understanding is attac hed. Order of Omega Order of Omega is a national Honor Society for juniors and seniors in the Greek community.

Institutional Effectiveness Changes within Unit: Greek Fee The 2017 Greek life Task Force issued seven immediate recommendations and an additional four considerations. In 2018, the fraternity and sorority community leadership also created a two -year strat egic plan that included seven content areas each with three to four strategies to focus on. It was quickly understood that current funding levels would prevent many of these initiatives to be accomplished. As a result, a benchmarking project began to inve stigate funding levels and sources of other fraternity and sorority communities across the country. Many institutions (LSU, Clemson, Penn, etc.) have implemented a fee for participation in fraternity and sorority life that would help fund staff, educationa l programming, and leadership development initiatives. A proposal was created alongside the four governing councils and approved by them. The proposal was later approved by the Vice President for Student Life/Dean of Students, John Stein; the Institute Pr esident, Bud Peterson; and the USG Board of Regents. The fee will begin this next fall 2019 semester. The approved proposal is attached and includes the planned programs and expenditures of the fee. Progress: Completed 72 Student Media I.

Significant Accomplishments Unit Description: As a department within the Division of Student Affairs, Student Publications and Media's mission is to develop and support student leaders in the areas of communication and the dissemination of information. This is readily achieved through the provision of quality facilities, equipment and administrative and financial support which allows those students engaging in student media, the opportunity to express themselves and grow as communicators in a variety of mediums. Significant Accomplishments: Some of the most notable accomplishments for the Office of Student Media in 2016 - 2017 include: The Technique student newspaper won (7) Georgia Collegiate Press Association's (GCPA) in their annual awards ceremony in in February 2019 in Athens, Georgia including First Place for \"Best Sports Photograph\"; The North Avenue Review, the Institute's free speech publication successfully printed 2 successful magazines for the year and celebrated a ninety percent distribution/pick up rate; 74 WREK Atlanta 91.1 FM celebrated it's 50th anniversary in March of 2018.

Progress: Completed V. Statistics Unit Statistics: Annual Technique Revenue In FY19 the Technique saw an approximate 20 percent decrease in advertising revenue from FY18. This reduction in income can be attributed to a continued drop in National advertising, a trend seen among a large per centage of college newspapers nationwide. The Advertising and Marketing Coordinator stayed in close communication with other similar peer institutions who also saw drops in advertising revenue. Continued efforts and revenue strategies will be enacted for the 2019 -2020 academic year including: possibly outsourcing advertising sales to a third party vendor, reduced pricing for bundle packages for multiple ads, increased communication with ad agencies and a larger canvasing of local businesses and industries. In addition, the Technique student newspaper will be reducing it's number of printed issues weekly (5,500 to 5,000) in order to conserve revenue. Student activity fee money for printing and operations 75 During the Fall of 2018 Spring of 2019 the student pu blications and WREK Atlanta 91.1 FM radio submitted and defended their FY20 student activity fee request before the Institute's student government association. In FY19, the student organizations received a significant decrease in funding to operate ($20,0 00.00 reduction in Technique OS&E/printing funding). A bill was submitted by the Technique in October 2019 for an additional $30,000.00 which was approved by SGA increasing that year's budget for their OS&E. The major change in funding for the coming FY2 0 fiscal year was a $10,000.00 reduction in The Technique student newspaper's printing (OS&E). The Erato literary journal, the North Avenue Review, The Tower and the T -Book all received the same funding as they had in FY18. WREK Atlanta 91.1 FM's budget wa s also kept at the FY18 allocation rate. Work force reduction Due to declining advertising revenue and the depletion of financial resources from previous revenue collection, the department's Coordinator position was eliminated in February of 2019. Optiona l forms of revenue management are being considered for 2019 -2020. Progress: Completed VI.

Institutional Effectiveness Changes within Unit: Not Applicable Progress: Completed 77 Counseling Center I. Mission/Introduction Essential Function(s) of department: Section I: Mission/Introduction The Georgia Tech Counseling Center is a unit of the Division of Student Life. The mission of the Georgia Tech Counseling Center is the dedication of its services to enhance the academic experience and success of all students by providing a variety of counseling and psychological services to students and the greater campus community. The Counseling Center accomplishes its mission by offering services to students that facilitate personal development, assist in the alleviation, remediation, and prevention of distress, and educate students in ways that develop self -awareness, self -reliance, and self-confidence. The Center's services are accredited by the International Association of Counseling Services (IACS). The internship program is accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA). The Center is a member of the Association of University and College Counseling Center Directors (AUCCCD), the Association for the Coordination of Counseling Center Clinical Services (ACCCCS), the Association of Counseling Center Training Agencies (ACCTA), the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship C enters (APPIC), the Association of Recovery in Higher Education, and the Association for University and College Counseling Center Outreach (AUCCCO). The Counseling Center also serves as a training site for graduate practicum students and doctoral interns. The practicum training program offers supervised training experiences in providing direct psychological services to students and the campus community. The doctoral internship training program is the capstone training experience for doctoral students in app lied health psychology. The internship training program offers training to those who are interested in gaining additional experience in working in a counseling center setting and attracts applicants from across the country who are matched with the Counseli ng Center through the National Matching Service. Overview of Counseling Services: Individual and Couples Counseling. The Center offers individual counseling for enrolled, degree -seeking students who present with a wide variety of psychological, vocational, and academic concerns. The most frequently assessed concerns are anxiety, depression and relationship issues. In addition, the Center provides couples counseling to students and their partners/spouses. To be eligible for couples counseling, one member of the couple must be a currently enrolled, degree -seeking student. The Counseling Center uses a short -term model of counseling to assist clients in addressing their concerns. Group Counseling. The Center typically offers about a dozen counseling groups each semester, including more general groups which support students in making positive 78 changes in their lives, as well as groups based on specific issues or student identities. Our groups program is rich and diverse, and encompasses support groups, therapy groups, and psychoeducational life skills workshops. Case Management. The Center's Case Manager coordinates community -based services and referrals in order to address longer -term care needs and persistent challenges that may be interfering with a student's abi lity for optimal functioning. A comprehensive listing of referral resources is maintained by the Counseling Center for students who are in need of extended services or whose presenting concerns are beyond the scope of service at the Center. The Case Manage r coordinates referrals as well as coordinates students' transition back to campus. Outreach and Wellness. The Counseling Center offers a number of educational programs and workshops. These workshops are open to all Georgia Tech students, faculty, and staf f. They cover topics such as stress management, anxiety management, relationships, and diversity and inclusion. The Center also provides consultation to a number of campus groups and coordinates services for a variety of campus constituencies. Emergency an d Crisis Services. The counseling staff provides crisis and emergency services during regular office hours as well as after -hours and during the weekend. A major improvement in Center services this year has been contracting for after -hours services with Pr otoCall, a national, higher -education -focused call center. ProtoCall is used by more than 400 organizations nationally and helps set the standard of practice for the management of after -hours emergent concerns. After -hours consultation and crisis service i s available through the ProtoCall system which is backed -up by the Georgia Tech Counseling Center counselor -on-duty. Emergency walk -in times are available during the week for students experiencing a personal crisis. The counseling staff is also available t o provide emergency response to campus incidents and events. Referral Services. Psychiatric referrals for medication evaluation and treatment are available through the Psychiatry Department at the Student Health Center. The Counseling Center works closely with the psychiatrists to facilitate referrals for psychiatric evaluations and follow -up as needed. Testing and Assessment. A variety of psychological, cognitive, and personality tests are available from licensed psychologists for clients. These include sc reenings for ADHD, personality assessment, and interest inventories. Mandatory screening for drug and alcohol concerns are also provided via referrals from the Office of Student Integrity. Progress: Completed II.

Policy/Procedure New or Changed Policy/Procedure: A Policy and Procedure review was conducted at the beginning of the summer (2019) and it was decided to continue substantive review next summer (2020) after the implementation of GT CARE. 84 Secondary Employment: The Counseling Center recognizes that it is a common practice in university counseling centers across the nation for some counseling center staff to elect to maintain secondary employment, particularly in the form of a private practice. The Georgia Tech Counseling Center has historically accommodated staff who wish to engage in secondary employment outside their scheduled GTCC work hours. Staff who engage in secondary employment are required to abide by the following provisions: 1. GTCC clinicians are at liberty to engage in secondary employment, particularly their own private practices, as long as they do so outside of their normally scheduled work hours. 2. All GTCC staff must annually disclose secondary employment on the appropriate Institute form. 3. USG property and resources may not be utilized for any GTCC staff private practice activities. 4. GTCC clinicians who maintain a private practice agree not to accept active Georgia Tech students into their practice as this is seen as a conflict of interest with the clinician's primary employment site. Justification: It is believed that the summer of 2020 will offer the best opportunity for articulating GT CARE's impact on Counseling Center policies and procedures. The primary impact is anticipated to concern work -flow processes around client intake and assignment. Progress: Completed IV. Significant Accomplishments Unit Description: Section IV: Significant Accomplishments and Challenges The 2018 -19 academic year began with positive growth for the Center, as a new director was on -boarded along with two new senior staff therapists (both seeking licensure as psychologists). The new director, arrived on July 2, 2018 after a 16 -year tenure at the University of Colorado at Boulder. She previously served 11 years as the Training Director for UC -Boulder's APA accredited internship and was also her department's Lead Psychologist for 5 years. She will complete a Mas ters of Engineering (Management) in the late summer of 2019. 85 The two new senior staff therapists on -boarded in the summer of 2018 began in late August, and currently coordinates graduate student services. He is also developing a coordination area in mindfu lness programming. The Coordinator of Graduate Student Services/Coordinator of Mindfullness is particularly interested in working with athletes and mindfulness. The Suicide Prevention and Crisis Response Coordinator began her tenure with the Counseling Cen ter in early September and coordinates Tech Ends Suicide Together, as well as the campus response to crises. She has specialized training in sport psychology and her other professional interests include diversity, equity, and social justice work. She compl eted her licensure requirements in March (2019) and is now a licensed psychologist. The 2018 -19 academic year continued to present considerable staffing challenges for the Counseling Center despite the new hires. We began the year with an interim Clinical Director. The August, 2018 resignation of a former CC staff left us with an open position for an Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) specialist. However, they remained with the Counseling Center as a part -time Tech Temp and continued to lead the AOD Team and admi nister mandated AOD screenings. Her tenure finished in July 2019. Across the course of the academic year, there were 3 failed searches for an AOD Psychologist. As a result, plans are underway for the next search to recruit a Master's level AOD specialist. There was also an initial failed search for an assessment specialist, but in November 2018 the Assessment and Testing Coordinator was hired at the conclusion of the second search. He completed his postdoctoral fellowship in neuropsychological assessment in the summer of 2018 and is in the process of seeking licensure as a psychologist. In December 2018 President Peterson announced the funding of 3 new master's level permanent staff positions for the Counseling Center. This offered the opportunity to expand the Center's campus presence into a Satellite program. The Satellite Counseling initiative will be piloted in the fall of 2019. In December 2018, the Center added an administrative part -time Tech Temp to assist with clerical and logistical needs within the Center as demand for counseling services continues to grow. In February 2019, one CC Staff accepted the open generalist psychologist position after completing his post -doctoral residency at the Center in December (2018). He is currently seeking licensure as a psychologist and has an interest in social media and technology. February 2019 saw the culmination of a Georgia Tech student -led effort to examine best practices in mental health with peer institutions nationally. The first ever Intercollegiate Mental Health Conference was organized by the Student Mental Health Coalition and hosted at the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center. 86 In the spring, an unfilled psychologist position was converted into a Case Manager position. This will be the second Case Ma nager for the Counseling Center. The search is underway with the plan to fill the position by the late summer of 2019. During the Fall semester, a unit leadership team comprised of members of the divisions of Student Life and of Campus Services began meeti ng to discuss the transition of the Office of Health & Well -Being from a specific department to an overall wellness climate and conversation for the campus. The divisions of Student Life and Campus Services now encompass a cross -divisional and shared repor ting structure working collaboratively to help guide the campus community toward an increasingly robust conversation about health and wellbeing at Georgia Tech. Team membership includes: the Vice President of Student Life and Dean of Students; the Associat e Vice President of Campus Services; the Director of the Georgia Tech Counseling Center; the Senior Director of Health Initiatives; the Director of Campus Recreation; the Senior Director of Stamps Health Services; and the Director of GT CARE. In the fall of 2018, an Implementation Team comprised of members of the divisions of Student Life and Campus Services began meeting to discuss how to actualize the vision of a separate service department dedicated to assessing students seeking entr\u00e9e into campus menta l health and other support services. The separate department was eventually named GT CARE (Center for Assessment, Referral and Education). Several members of the Counseling Center were on this team. Over the coming AY 2019 -20, GT CARE and the Counseling Ce nter will be working closely together to streamline processes for service access and delivery to the campus community. In May of 2019, one CC Staff completed her tenure as the Counseling Center's Office Manager. Ms. Wilson had been working in the Counselin g Center for about 18 months and was a dedicated and valued member of the Division of Student Life for many years. The Administrative Professional I accepted the position of Senior Administrative Assistant and begins her new job on July 14, 2019. Significa nt service enhancements were implemented during the year. A new wellness - oriented app called WellTrack was purchased through a grant from the Joint Allocation Committee of the Student Government and was rolled out to the campus in the fall of 2018. This ap p is provided to clients of the Center as well as any enrolled Georgia Tech student and offers immediate support for depression, anxiety and stress. The app has more than 600 users and continues to grow in popularity. Another significant enhancement to ser vice provision involved the Center contracting with a nationally - known after -hours emergency phone service called ProtoCall. This service provides immediate mental health support for students outside the regular operating hours of the Counseling Center. Th e Counseling Center staff continue to provide back -up to this system in the event that a local response is required after hours and on the weekend. Other new initiatives supported by grants from the Joint Allocations Committee of the Student Government Ass ociation include upgraded and enhanced assessment materials; biofeedback lab equipment; training in Koru mindfulness; and weighted blankets for use during acute anxiety episodes. 87 In years past, several Counseling Center programs were newly gifted or re -gifted with both endowments and liquid operating funds. These programs include the Collegiate Recovery Program, Tech Ends Suicide Together, and the Peer Coaching Program. The endowment for the Peer Coaching Program continues to grow through the generosity of the Stamps President's Scholars Class Gift and the continued generosity of the benefactor who originally funded the program. Additionally, VP/DOS Stein allocated $50,000 from the Stamps President Discretionary Endowment to several programs within the Couns eling Center: Collegiate Recovery Program; Mindfulness Program; Outreach; Peer Coaching Program; and Tech Ends Suicide Together. During the summer of 2019 the Counseling Center underwent a substantive renovation giving the Center a lovely calming and welco ming ambiance. Both students and campus partners have offered positive reviews of the updates. As AY19 -20 approaches, the Counseling Center looks forward to continuing to serve the Georgia Tech community with our innovative programming, and our dedicated a nd award -winning staff. Progress: Completed V. Statistics Unit Statistics: The Counseling Center continued to provide quality services through AY2018 -19, striving to meet the needs of students and the campus by providing a range of counseling and outreach/ consultation services. The following tables are aggregate data which offer an overview of client demographics and services rendered by the Counseling Center. Summary of Counseling Services 88 Client Demographics 89 90 91 92 93 94 Clinical Services Satellite Clinical Services . A Satellite Counseling initiative is in development at the time of this writing and will be piloted in the fall of 2019. Housing counselors in an academic department provides accessibility to services in a convenient location; additional ly, we hope to reach students who would not have typically sought out services. Two licensed mental health clinicians will be hired (Licensed Professional Counselor or Licensed Clinical Social Worker) and placed in satellite locations within the College of Engineering. The specific office spaces are located in the Mechanical Engineering building and the Biomedical Engineering Building. A third counselor, who will have an office in the College of Computing, will be hired several months after the program is p iloted. The Counseling Center will be responsible for funding these positions and providing administrative supervision. The logistics and details are still being refined and an agreement between GT Counseling Center and Engineering will be written so that each party has an understanding of privacy, roles and expectations. Biofeedback Services . The biofeedback initiative is in development and will expand services to students by offering a workshop series. Each group of 8 students will complete three modules over three successive weeks. These modules will include a teaching component about stress, activities, breathing exercises, and time on the biofeedback equipment. The purpose of this initiative is to provide students with concrete data that will show them the benefits of utilizing stress reduction techniques. New Workshop Series: Anxiety Toolbox . The Counseling Center piloted a new, three -session Anxiety Toolbox workshop as an additional service for clients of the Counseling Center who were dealing with anx iety concerns. The workshop provided information about symptoms of anxiety and focused on teaching practical anxiety - management skills. Anxiety Toolbox also included workbooks for each client to use to practice skills between sessions. One Anxiety Toolbox workshop was offered in Fall 2018, and three were offered in Spring 2018. The pilot of Anxiety Toolbox indicates that it was useful to clients and well -received by them. Overall, 19 students started with the Anxiety Toolbox program, with 14 completing the program. Of the 14 who completed the program, 86% said it was \"very true\" or \"slightly true\" that they learned what they needed to effectively address their concerns, 85% reported that it was \"very true\" or \"slightly true\" that the program helped them, 93% said it was \"very true\" or \"slightly true\" that they would recommend Anxiety Toolbox to a friend. The Counseling Center plans to continue offering Anxiety Toolbox and to pilot similar three -session workshops for clients within the coming year. Counsel ing Center Clinical Services Outcome Data . The Counseling Center engages in ongoing assessment of client experiences at the Center. Each year, the Center randomly surveys its clients during 2 weeks in the Fall and Spring semesters to assess the degree of t heir satisfaction with the Counseling Center, the degree of satisfaction with their progress during counseling, and the degree to which counseling has been helpful to them in their academic success. The survey is based on a 5 -point Likert -scale rating from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 5 (very satisfied). In sum, clients 95 indicated that they were satisfied with their overall counseling experience and that counseling was helpful in improving or maintaining their academic performance. Average Rating How satis fied are you with the services you have received at the Counseling Center? 4.26 How satisfied were you with your initial screening appointment? 4.18 How satisfied are you on your progress with the concerns that brought you to counseling? 3.84 How satisfied have you been with your counselor? 4.58 How satisfied are you that your counselor understands the nature of your concerns? 4.49 How satisfied are you with how your counselor respects your culture and identity? 4.85 How satisfied are you with the assistance of the Front Desk staff? 4.61 How helpful has counseling been to you in supporting your academic progress? 3.80 How helpful has counseling been to you in remaining at Tech? 4.03 How likely would you be to recommend our services to a friend? 4.42 Client Experience of Counseling . Clients were also asked to provide open feedback and comments about their experience at the Counseling Center. Below is a sample of client comments: \"My counselor is amazing, caring, and super supportive! She made all of my fears of therapy disappear. An amazing woman.\" \"Ever since I began utilizing the counseling center at Tech, I have seen a massive increase in productivity for myself and a positive outlook that I have not been able to maintain for the last few semesters.\" \"The counseling department seems to do an excellent job helping students find the right resources.\" \"I appreciate all the help. My counselor is an amazing therapist. Thank you!\" \"Helped tremendously over the semester, I'm very thankf ul for having this resource available.\" \"I appreciate the counseling center's services despite the recent backlash. Ya'll are doing great work.\" \"I like my counselor very much. She understands me, is empathetic to my concerns and I felt heard from her in both the way she allows me to speak and in the way she asks questions. I very much hope to stay with her throughout my 96 time here. The staff is also very friendly and kind. I very much felt welcome from day 1 and [the Counseling Center] gave me options o f alternative treatment while I waited to be matched with a counselor.\" \"My counselor is amazing. I'm so grateful to have spent my time with her this semester. She gave me a way better perspective on things and let me feel like I could really help myself get to a better place. I am so satisfied with the counseling center. Thank you so much for the help this semester.\" \"Counseling helped me so much in ways I didn't even imagine, thank you all!\" \"Staff is super friendly! I feel comfortable telling my co unselor any and everything and she's always patient and kind to me, especially when I'm super emotional and irritable. I love coming to see my counselor and my mood always improves afterwards Thank you for sticking w/ me and listening to me!!\" \"There's no way I could've completed my grad degree without counseling. I think if the resources are there, it should be mandatory for all PhD students to have at least one therapy session every 3 -6 months. I am forever grateful for the services I received here fr om my counselor. She deserves a raise. I received better therapy than from an outside provider in which I had to pay a copay for.\" \"My counselor is amazing, the best therapist I have ever had. She goes above and beyond to help me stay on track. I have be nefited so much from the counseling center.\" \"I have really appreciated your services during a difficult last year at Tech. I think that the counseling services have been unfairly criticized by the student body, at least based on my experience. Thank you for your help.\" Of note, there were a number of comments from clients about how to improve services. These comments may be instrumental in refining services as new directions for Clinical Services are explored. Constructive criticism and suggestions inclu ded: \"Literally the only thing I did not like was the surveys before each session because it would make me anxious about what I put last time or who was going to see my results.\" \"I feel as though this counseling center assumes that you have ample time outside of classes to focus on your mental health, which I know is definitely not the case. I think I would have rather received better advice on how to take care of things in the moment instead of more preventative measures for self -care. I am satisfied in some aspects but not satisfied in others.\" \"The initial wait for an appointment was long but understandable. My sessions have not only been therapeutic, but overall enjoyable.\" \"I am concerned that I will be forced out of counseling to an off -site ser vice before I am ready. It was really hard to get help and I'm making progress, but this worries me. I've put in a lot of effort with my current therapist.\" \"Definitely time limited. Could have a lot of potential with multiple semesters.\" \"I like the s ervice received here very much, but I also think the counseling resources for the GT community is still insufficient.\" \"The number of counselors is still extremely low, and it takes too long to setup an appointment. With the high stress environment of Te ch, appointments should 97 be more readily available.\" \"Long wait until I was able to start counseling, but I am very satisfied with my counseling.\" \"Already I've recommended counseling to others on campus. Great work. I would like to see slightly more in tegration between counseling and psychiatry, though. Sometimes it feels like I see two separate helpers when it would be good to all be on the same page, especially since I am not particularly good at explaining the long term goals and expectations.\" \"I am not sure you all already have a presence on gatech Reddit thread but it might help if you all could see what current and past students talk/vent about regarding the culture here at tech. Both academic and mental.\" \"My experience with my counselor has been great. The only part of the process I was dissatisfied by was the amount of time between my initial consultation and being assigned a counselor. However, all that being said, it was worth the wait and I am overly satisfied with the experience and the things I have learned.\" Group Counseling . Group counseling continued to be offered by the Counseling Center. Group counseling is offered through 2 service types: Life Skills psychoeducational workshops and psychotherapy groups. For 2018 -2019, the Center was successful in offering 11 groups in the Fall, 13 groups in the Spring, and 3 groups in the Summer semester. The groups program resulted in 1,444 client hours. Senior staff facilitated a number of groups throughout the year. Groups were also facilitated/c o- facilitated by interns and practicum students. Mindfulness Groups . Mindfulness is described as \"Awareness of the present moment, with nonjudgment,\" and is an effective treatment for a host of clinical concerns including stress, anxiety, depression, perfo rmance issues, and emotional regulation. The Counseling Center offers several different services of increasing length and intensity that help Georgia Tech students develop mindfulness skills through the introduction and practice of formal mindfulness medit ation. The \"Intro to Mindfulness Workshop\" is a one-hour workshop in which a clinician provides students with psychoeducation about mindfulness and its benefits and leads students in an introductory meditation. \"Koru Mindfulness\" is an empirically -supporte d four -session mindfulness course. A skills - oriented course, Koru teaches students a variety of meditation techniques and promotes the development of mindfulness skills through readings, psychoeducation, and discussion among group members. The \"Mindfulness for Managing Stress Group\" is the Counseling Center's most rigorous mindfulness -based treatment. The group takes place over the course of an entire semester. In addition to learning and practicing mindfulness meditation skills, students in this group have the opportunity to engage in more in -depth discussions about their personal concerns, receive feedback from group members, and actively learn how to apply mindfulness in their lives to improve their well -being. 98 Group Counseling Outcome Data . In 2018 -2019, clients were asked to provide their evaluation of their group experience. The survey is based on a 5 -point Likert -scale rating from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 5 (very satisfied). In sum, clients indicated that they were satisfied with their overall gro up counseling experience and that group counseling was helpful in improving or maintaining their academic performance. The results from each survey item are presented as follows: Average Rating How satisfied are you with the services you have received at the Counseling Center? 4.44 How satisfied were you with your initial consultation appointment? 4.32 How satisfied are you with the assistance of the Front Desk staff? 4.37 How satisfied have you been with your group counselor(s)? 4.68 How satisfied are you that your group counselor(s) understand(s) the nature of your concerns? 4.66 How satisfied are you that your group counselor(s) respects your culture and identity? 4.73 How satisfied are you on your progress with the concerns that brought you into group counseling? 4.02 From your experience in group therapy, how satisfied are you with your ability to connect with others in the group? 4.24 From your experience in group therapy, how satisfied are you with the degree of safety to explore your co ncerns in the group? 4.66 How helpful has counseling been to you in improving or maintaining your academic progress? 4.05 How helpful has counseling been to you in remaining at Tech? 4.19 How likely would you be to recommend our services to a friend? 4.63 Client Experience of Group Counseling . In addition, clients were also asked to provide open feedback and comments as to their group counseling experience at the Counseling Center. Below is a sample of the client comments: \"I thought it was best tha t I was able to voice my concerns in a safe environment. It also helped being able to hear that other people who are my peers are going through the same things that I am going through.\" \"Group counseling has been a good opportunity to open up to stranger s. I still have some difficulty relating to other people's problems. A positive is that I now realize how important it is to express my feelings and opinions.\" 99 \"Everyone from the counselors to the other students in the group helped me immensely throughou t the semester.\" \"I have had an amazing experience in group. It fosters growth and communication. Thank you!\" \"Group was very valuable to me in many aspects. However; one area that I got frustrated with was the common complaining about Tech. That helpe d for a bit and solutions were offered, but sometimes I felt we focused too much on the negatives about Tech instead of the positives.\" \"I believe group counseling and the Counseling Center are extremely valuable resource for students at Tech.\" \"I real ly appreciated the sessions in which my counselors were very direct in keeping us focused on interpersonal communication within the group. Those sessions were challenging but very useful.\" \"My group counselor has been fantastic. He truly has helped me so much through these sessions.\" Case Management Services . The Counseling Center continued to offer case management services as an integral part of the stepped -care model and an effective intervention that promotes continuity of care. Case management is a sp ecific form of service which assists students with longer -term care needs and/or persistent challenges that may be interfering with their ability for optimal functioning at Georgia Tech. During the Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 semesters, thirty -five students were internally referred for case management services. The caseload consisted primarily of clients with a higher acuity who required longer -term individual counseling. The case management process included weekly contacts with clients, assistance with obtai ning an off -campus therapist and/or psychiatrist, facilitation of phone calls and necessary client paperwork, and consultation with appropriate mental health providers. In addition, the Case Manager regularly assisted Counseling Center staff clinicians wit h identifying the appropriate referral options for clients that were not assigned specifically for case management services. Upon request, the Case Manager consulted with parents, students, and colleagues at other institutions who sought connection with me ntal health providers in the surrounding communities. The Case Manager assisted in the facilitation of voluntary and mandated assessments of clients by an Emergency Receiving Facility (ERF). During the academic year, there were eight voluntary hospitaliza tions and fifteen involuntary hospitalizations facilitated by the Counseling Center during business hours. The coordination of care included maintaining contact with the facility upon admission, requesting regular follow -ups with the treating clinician, an d assisting in discharge planning. The Case Manager facilitated the development of a Memorandum of Understanding with two Emergency Receiving Facilities in the Atlanta area. The Case Manager continued to serve as a liaison with the Psychiatry Clinic in Sta mps Health Services and worked closely with the department's Care Coordinators. The Case Manager led a weekly meeting with the Care Coordinators that encouraged continued 100 collaboration, clinical consultation, treatment recommendations, presentation of diff icult client cases, and professional development. The Case Manager is the primary contact between the Counseling Center and off - campus clinicians who serve as referral sources for therapy and psychiatric care. During the course of the year, the Case Manage r organized two Coffee Hours for community mental health providers who were interested in joining the Referral Database. The networking event was co -hosted by the Psychiatry Clinic. As a result, over forty -five (45) clinicians were added as a referral sour ce. Testing and Assessment Services . The Counseling Center continued to provide a variety of assessment services through 2018 -2019, including screenings and psychoeducational evaluations for Attention -Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Learning Disabilitie s. In addition, a range of other assessment services, including interest inventories, personality, and psychological testing are available based on students' needs. Mandatory AOD assessments are also provided via referrals from the Office of Student Integr ity. AOD Services . The Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Team provides client care, staffing, consultation and support for clinicians providing AOD services (both voluntary and mandated) through the GTCC. Facilitated by the department's AOD Specialist, th e team is multidisciplinary and comprised of psychologists, a Stamps psychiatrist, a post - doctoral resident and three psychology doctoral interns. The team offers treatment recommendations for clients who present with substance use concerns, even in cases where alcohol and/or other drug use is not perceived by the client to be a primary presenting issue. The AOD Treatment team also offers ongoing education/training related to substance use. Members of the AOD Treatment Team complete comprehensive mandated evaluations for students who are referred to the Georgia Tech Counseling Center (GTCC) from the Office of the Dean of Students or Housing for alcohol and drug -related infractions. Recommendations based on the results of these evaluations may range from sim ple education to referrals for intensive outpatient treatment or higher, depending on the client's needs. Between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019, 64 mandated evaluations were completed by 3 clinicians. 101 Collegiate Recovery Program . The Collegiate Recovery P rogram (CRP) offers a safe and welcoming community for undergraduate and graduate students in recovery from substance use disorders. Recognizing that social isolation and high levels of stress may threaten sobriety and trigger relapse into high -risk drinki ng or drug use, the Collegiate Recovery Program provides social and emotional support, recovery -focused educational seminars, and connections with other campus resources. An institutional member of the Association for Recovery in Higher Education, Georgia Tech's CRP is part of a rapidly expanding recovery advocacy movement in institutions of higher education nationwide that provides high quality programs and services for students who are working to achieve academic success while maintaining hard -earned sobr iety. The values of the Collegiate Recovery Program include: wellness through sober and healthy living, academic excellence, leadership and civic engagement, and connection through meaningful relationships. Involvement in the Collegiate Recovery Program re quires that students maintain a minimum of 90 days of continuous sobriety, demonstrate a commitment to academic progress, consistently attend the weekly educational seminar, and actively participate in a community 12 -step program. Admission is contingent u pon the completion of an application and an interview with program staff. Recognizing that social isolation and high levels of stress may threaten sobriety and trigger relapse into high -risk drinking or drug use, the Collegiate Recovery Program provides so cial and emotional support, recovery -focused educational seminars, and connections with other campus resources. In an environment where high -risk alcohol and other drug use can be prevalent, normalized and woven into the fabric of the campus culture, high quality programs and services for students who are attempting to achieve academic success while maintaining sobriety are essential. Providing students with programming such as retreats and social events normalizes their college experience and reduces the s tigma surrounding their recovery. This programming also strengthens their bonds to other students who are in the unique position to understand exactly what it feels like to be a college student in recovery. The Collegiate Recovery Program is administered t hrough the Counseling Center and by a Collegiate Recovery Program Coordinator. A total of 22 students participated in the CRP during 2018 -2019. Overview of Programs and Services During the 2018 -2019 school year, members of the CRP participated in a number of programs and offered a number of services, including the following: Offered weekly recovery focused seminars.

Two students graduated in December 2018. Five students graduated in May 2019. The Coffee Bike was featured in the Daily Digest. The CR P hosted Riley's Wish Lecture Series, which focused on how to better serve co-occurring disorders, including substance use disorders, obsessive -compulsive disorder and eating disorders, in various settings and help families support their loved ones. Recove ry Program Outcome Data A total of 22 students participated in the CRP during AY2018 -2019. For those students involved, evaluations were administered to assess their experience in the program.

All students identified dedicated space as an additional support service that would be particularly beneficial to them. All students i dentified scholarships as an additional support service that would be particularly beneficial to them. In addition, students were asked to provide open feedback and comments as to their CRP experience. Below is a sample of student comments from 2018 -2019 : \"It has been crucial to my ongoing recovery to have an active support group that is on campus that provides specific support for Tech students and this past semester I have learned how to successfully have healthy sober relationships.\" \"The most rewa rding part of my participation in the CRP has been learning the tools to build a healthy routine. The CRP has helped me build a support network and I would not have been able to succeed without that.\" 103 \"This year I learned that, with the support of the CR P, if I put in the time and the effort I can't be stopped.\" \"It's important to have people around you that understand recovery in a high achieving academic setting and the CRP is a place where I can be of service, share my wins and losses and receive hel p.\" \"The CRP was my first experience with sobriety and without this program I'm not sure where my path would have led. Finding a supportive community that is understanding of what I went through and continue to struggle with has made all the difference.\" 104 Outreach and Wellness Services Outreach and Wellness Services. Outreach and wellness services are an integral part of the Counseling Center's mission, serving students, faculty and staff through educational programming, mental health screenings, crisis support, consultation, and collaboration. Outreach and wellness services are preventive, teaching skills for the enhancement of mental wellness and the prevention of significant mental health concerns; increasing students' willingness to seek help if neede d; increasing awareness of Counseling Center services; expanding access to services; and facilitating the development of a campus environment that supports the wellbeing of Georgia Tech students. The Counseling Center's Crisis Response and Suicide Preventi on Programs, Graduate Student Services, Diversity and Inclusion, and Social Media and Technology Programming are all a part of Outreach and Wellness Services. During AY2018 -19 the Counseling Center continued to successfully provide quality outreach and wel lness services. A total of 215 outreach and wellness programs and activities were provided to the campus community, serving a total of 6055 individuals. Programs and activities included those proactively offered to the campus, and those requested by variou s members of the campus community and campus partners. Workshops Our most frequently requested workshops focused on providing general information about the Counseling Center and mental health issues, and stress management. Other popular outreach topics in cluded suicide prevention, grief, crisis response, and diversity issues. The Wellness and Stress Management workshop series was again offered in Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 semesters and was open to all members of the campus community on location. Workshop t opics for this series included the following: Stress Management 101 Manage Your Time, Manage Your Stress Boosting Your Academic Self -Confidence Mindfulness and Meditation Using Psychology to Enhance Your Academic and Test Performance Stress Man agement for International Students Assertiveness Skills for Effective Communication Creating Healthy Relationships Staying Healthy as a Graduate Student Scholar 105 These, and other workshops, were also available to be requested by members of the campus community throughout the year.

Mental Health Screening Mental health screening can increase mental health awareness and identify persons who m ight be experiencing difficulties, but who might not yet have connected with appropriate treatment. The Counseling Center hosted two Depression Screening Day events, screening 109 students in Fall 2018 and Spring 2019, with an additional number of students receiving information about depression without completing the screening. Eighty -five of the students screened were recommended for follow -up evaluations. Let's Talk After a period of contraction in the 2017 -2018 year, the Counseling Center expanded the Let's Talk walk -in consultation program to the campus community in 2018 -2019. Let's Talk is an outreach program designed to engage students by providing informal, brief, confidential walk -in consultations with Counseling Center counselors at locations across campus. Let's Talk is intended to reach students who might be unlikely to seek traditional mental health services at the Counseling Center. Let's Talk is different from counseling in that there is no clinical paperwork to complete, no formal intake proc ess, and no scheduled appointments. The service is open to all graduate and undergraduate Georgia Tech students on campus. Locations for regularly scheduled Let's Talk hours in the past year included the Communication Center in Fall 2018 and Spring 2019, t he LGBTQIA Resource Center in Fall 2018, and the Center for Engineering Education and Diversity (CEED) office in April 2019. Additional ad -hoc Let's Talk hours were provided during times of crisis on campus (e.g., Fall 2018 Open Door Day). A total of 66 wa lk-in consultation hours were offered to the campus, with 33 individuals attending Let's Talk over the course of the year, representing a 65% increase in the number of students seen in the 2016 -2017 year, when Let's Talk was last offered in both the fall a nd spring semesters. Collaboration and Campus Support The Counseling Center continued to join with a number of campus organizations and 106 departments (e.g., Residence Life; New Student & Transition Programs; Graduate Resource and Information Network; Offic e of International Education; Women's Resource Center) to provide programs to students, staff, and faculty. For example, Counseling Center staff participated in FASET and International Student Orientation. Health Initiatives and the Counseling Center colla borated to provide a program to library staff on fostering student resilience and help -seeking. The Counseling Center also provided staffing support and debriefing for a number of campus -wide programs related to mental health distress and grief, including co-coordinating the response for Open Door Day (community crisis response and support), and participating in Take Back the Night (sexual assault awareness and prevention), When the Whistle Blows, and The LGBTQIA Resource Center and Pride Alliance Scout Sch ultz Memorial (remembrance events). Initiatives/Special Projects Health Initiatives and the Counseling Center partnered for the campus' first Fresh Check Day, a mental health and suicide prevention fair. The Counseling Center has been involved in two c urriculum infusion projects. Postdoctoral Fellow Leah Misemer, Ph.D., created a first -year writing course focused on the theme of \"Graphic Medicine: Comics and Mental Health,\" and invited two members of the Counseling Center staff to evaluate and provide f eedback for the mental health content of the comics developed by students. In response to interest expressed by the Student Government Association (SGA) in including mental health information in GT 1000, and following consultation with SGA and the Center for Academic Enrichment, the Counseling Center began development of a curriculum infusion resource for GT 1000 and GT 2000, with program piloting expected for Fall 2019. The Counseling Center developed a Residence Life Work -Life Balance workshop series focused on stress management and well -being for Residence Life student staff members. Outreach and Wellness services brought their assessment processes in line with those of the Division of Student Life by piloting the use of Baseline software for evaluati on. Outreach Outcome Data Evaluations were conducted for outreach programs provided to students and the campus. Ratings are based on a 5 -point Likert scale (1=poor, 5=excellent). The past year's evaluation results indicate that the Center's outreach progra ms continue to be effective in engaging with attendees, increasing mental health awareness and teaching skills (i.e., mental health learning goals), and enhancing students' academic functioning. 107 Diversity and Inclusion . Diversity and Inclusion is an area within the Counseling Center's Outreach and Wellness Services charged with providing education and advocacy for the mental health needs of students at Georgia Tech, particularly those with marginalized social identities. This advocacy involves both intern al education, assessment, and staff development around multicultural competence, and external programming geared towards constituents including faculty, staff, and parents, but primarily towards students.

The Coordinator of Diversity and Inclusion took on responsibility for the Practicum training program in May 2019. Peer Coaching Program: The Peer Coaching Program, now at the end of its fifth academic year (and having had four training cohorts), continues to grow. To date, 38 students have been trained as peer coaches, including five graduate students (new as of fall 2017), and 11 students (both undergraduate and graduate) who completed their training this past fall (2018). In the 2018 -19 academic year, five coaches were active in the fall and nine coaches were active in the spring (providing peer coaching services to consultees and participating in group supervision). To date, 79 student consultees have received peer coaching services (since the official implementation of services in spring 2016), with 6 students receiving services for more than one semester. Most recently, in the past academic year, 36 new students utilized the program ( 14 students in the fall, and 22 students in the spring). 112 As of June 2019, of all 79 students who have received peer coaching services thus far, only 14 (18%) have needed additional/more intensive services (whether it be individual or group counseli ng, crisis intervention, or referrals) for the same presenting concerns or related issues within one year after terminating peer coaching. This percentage is even lower (only 8%) when we exclude the data from before the program's screening criteria was for malized and included in the Counseling Center's Policies and Procedures 113 Manual.

Increasing the number of coaches by recr uiting coaches and holding applications twice a year, and providing trainings twice a year (both in the fall and in the spring, instead of just in the fall). Providing each peer coach with a personal copy of the training textbook in addition to the tradi tional graduation gift (a Peer Coaching Program t -shirt) at the end of their training. Implementing the newly developed Peer Coach Self -Assessment Survey, to further monitor and ensure quality of services and coaches' knowledge and skill levels. Engagi ng in further collaboration with the Counseling Center and other departments to expand outreach and peer education efforts (including participation in Fresh Check Day, Suicide Prevention Week, Depression Screening Day, etc.) Improving the program's data collection and record -keeping to be able to analyze historic demographic trends (beyond the last academic year), as well as most common presenting concerns, and identify majors/departments to target in future marketing efforts. Expanding the program's on line presence through social media campaigns in collaboration with the Counseling Center's social media coordinator.

Further increasing access to the program by offering peer coaching services in the summer. Offering office/walk -in hours in our own, dedicated space outside of the Counseling Center. Collaborating with the Dep artment of Housing to have \"in -house\" coaches in the dorms. Exploring additional referral sources in collaboration with other departments across campus.

Institutional Effecti veness 125 Changes within Unit: Section VIII: Institute Effectiveness Our first annual goal focused on client symptom relief. Assessment results indicated that Counseling Center services remain effective in alleviating client presenting concerns, as measured by the CCAPS (Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms). Our second annual goal involved measuring the impact of GT CARE on the utilization of the Counseling Center's triage hours. Because GT CARE did not open during the 2018 - 19 year, we wer e unable to measure this goal. Our third annual goal focused on supporting the implementation of GT CARE which we were able to do through regular Counseling Center participation on the Implementation Team for GT CARE on a weekly basis beginning in January (2019). Counseling Center personnel also participated on Search Committees to hire a GT CARE Director and GT CARE Case Managers, and consulted on Titanium usage with the Director of GT CARE.

Time Frame : Beginning May 6, 2019 and ending on August 9, 2019. Individuals Affected by this policy : All individuals who work in Health Initiatives The dress code for Fridays during the aforementioned time frame in the summer may include, in addition to business casual attire, the following: Denim jeans that are neat, clean, and stain -free Collare d or polo -style shirts or golf shirts Appropriate: Denim jeans in dark -wash blue, black, white, or other traditional color Collared, polo -style shirts Inappropriate: 156 \"Jeggings\" (leggings made out of denim) Yoga or athletic pants or bottoms made out of denim Wrinkled jeans \"Distressed\" jeans with fraying, raw hems, holes, rips, or patches anywhere Bleached or faded jeans Skinny jeans that fit very tightly like a legging Jeans that fit so loosely that they hang below the natural waistline T-shirts, with the exception of Georgia Tech branded t -shirts approved for special events Off-the-shoulder tops, or shirts with cut -outs on the shoulders or sleeves (\"cold shoulder\" tops) Collared or polo -shirts with inappropriate graphics or emblems, or logos from other businesses, organizations, colleges, or universities Supervisors reserve the right to revise or revoke this policy at its discretion. Radical departures from conventional dress or personal grooming standards will not be permitted. When attending meetings or events with leadership, customers, and the public on Fridays, your attire should be business casual and consistent with a positive business image. If you are giving a presentation or meeting with parents on a Friday (e.g., FASET), you must wear business casual dress. Requests for advice and assistance in administering or interpreting this guidance should be directed to supervisors. Enforcement Managers are responsible for monitoring and enforcing this policy. The policy will be administered according the following action steps: 1. If questionable attire is worn in the office, the manager will hold a personal, private discussion with the employee to advise and counsel the employee regarding the inappropriateness of the attire. 2. If an obvious policy violation o ccurs, the department manager will hold a private discussion with the employee and assist the employee with ideas on how to come into compliance with the dress code through modification (e.g., find a sweater or jacket to cover a top). o If the employee can g o home and return within a short amount of time to change their attire immediately, this will be permitted. o If the employee cannot go home and return within a reasonable amount of time, then the employee will be sent home without pay for the remainder of the day. 3. Repeated policy violations will result in the employee's inability to use this relaxed summer policy. Justification: 157 Allow employee(s) and supervisor to establish individual schedules that meet the business needs of each area, while still offering employees the flexibility of a compressed schedule during the summer. Health Initiatives recognizes the growing popularity of casual business dress and the positive effects of a relaxed attire to boost morale, improve well -being, and create a more comfortable work environment during the summer months. Therefore, casual business attire will be permitted on Fridays during the summer. Progress: Completed IV. Significant Accomplishments Unit Description: Health Initiatives cultivates a thriving environment that enhances lifelong well -being among students and employees who live, learn, and work in the Georgia Tech community. The department influences and empowers the campus community to practice healthy lifestyle behaviors by providing inclusive a nd innovative prevention - based programs, individual and group support services, and co -curricular learning experiences through strategic collaboration. Significant Accomplishments: Health Initiatives created a department mission statement, vision statement and strategic plan in summer 2018. Health Initiatives was a key campus partner in carrying out the work of the Path Forward Together initiative the senior director was charged with the responsibility of several objectives (e.g. peer education strategies, new technologies, etc.). In February of 2019, a reimagined matrixed partnership was developed that led to Health and Wellbeing at Georgia Tech (HW@GT), a teaming structure that created a broader mission, added new resources, and recognized that campus health and well -being spanned divisions. On March 1st, Health Initiatives began to report directly to the Division of Student Life with a secondary reporting line to Campus Services, and this alignment reflected the close interdependencies of the student -focus ed educational and care mission of Health Initiatives and other Student Life units, Health Initiatives provided new opportunities for the campus community to support and promote health and well -being. o The Senior Director of Health Initiatives was invited t o be a part of the pre - convocation festivities and shared strategies for self -care and help - seeking to yield a successful first year at Tech to incoming first year students at Convocation. o Health Initiatives presented during seven graduate student orientat ion trainings, reaching approximately 800 graduate students in total. Also, 158 topic -specific presentations were provided to academic schools, and Health Initiatives participated in the graduate student picnic, served during the Graduate Expo, and volunteered during Graduate Student Appreciation Week. o Health Initiatives and the Counseling Center co -sponsored Georgia Tech's 1st annual Fresh Check Day, an uplifting mental health promotion and suicide prevention event from the Jordan Porco Foundation that include s interactive expo booths, peer -to-peer messaging and the support of multiple campus departments and student groups. o Health Initiatives, in partnership with the Counseling Center and Stamps Psychiatry, provided several trainings on how to support students' mental health and well -being to the campus community including GT1000 instructors, Housing staff, Athletics staff and Administration & Finance staff. o Health Initiatives also launched three new programs and services this year: Healthy Jacket Peer Education - The Healthy Jacket Peer Educators are student leaders who serve as healthy lifestyle role models to their peers. They are extensively trained volunteers who give presentations on a variety of health topics, design and implement health programs for stude nts and collaborate with campus partners to create a healthy community. Wellness Coaching - Students meet with professional health coach to optimize their health and well -being through goal -setting, forward -thinking, reflection, and self -discovery Transit Financial Wellness - an online course designed to provide students with the skills to understand their finances and successfully transition in and out of the college experience. Health Initiatives received an evidence -based practice grant from the National Consortium for Building Healthy Academic Communities to implement a program in the Georgia Tech community to improve sleep habits within students. A \"Sleep Week\" campaign kickoff in March that covered different topics important to improving sleep habits s uch as circadian rhythm, bedroom environment, the connection between sleep and academics, napping, and myths around sleep. Education, interactive activities, and giveaways were provided to engage Georgia Tech students. Health Initiatives published the exec utive results of the Spring 2018 mental health and wellbeing surveys. Health Initiatives partnered with the School of Psychology for a second year providing senior capstone experiences to students in Applied Experimental Psychology (PSYC 4031). The two res earch projects were: o To understand students' perceptions of resiliency and resilient behaviors on campus, and to identify factors that can promote resiliency in students at Tech 159 o To understand students' engagement in mindfulness and mindfulness behavior, an d to identify feasible ways to cultivate mindfulness on the Tech campus. The Alcohol & Other Drug Action Committee, co -chaired by Stacy Connell and Jamison Keller, assistant dean and director of Sorority & Fraternity Life, received the Division of Student Life Matter of Degree Award. This award acknowledges an individual, campus group, or organization whose efforts demonstrate the positive impact of actively reducing high -risk drinking and improve their campus community. In May 2019, President Peterson char ged a new Employee Wellbeing Council, co-chaired by a GTHR Staff and the Senior Director of Health Initiatives, to create and maintain a culture that supports and promotes the overall well -being of Georgia Tech faculty and staff. The University System of G eorgia (USG) requires that all campuses have a council focused on the health and well -being of staff and faculty. This Employee Well -being Council fulfills this expectation. The Employee Well -being Council is charged with the identification, design and implementation of activities and strategies geared to improve the health and well - being of employees and to create a healthier workplace.

Institutional Effectiveness Changes within Unit: 170 Student mental health is a priority for Georgia Tech elevated through the work of the President's Action Teams and Path Forward Together from the 2017 -2018 academic year. In spring 2018, Health Initiatives in partnership with the Division of Student Life, the Counseling Center and Campus Services, conducted four surveys to evaluate student mental health and well -being and the annual campus services satisfact ion survey. As a result of these findings plus the institutional prioritization of student mental health, it became even more important to Health Initiatives to support student mental health and well -being as much as possible in the 2018 -2019 academic yea r. Health Initiatives provided new and innovative programming, educational trainings and outreach to Georgia Tech students to promote their well -being and to demonstrate how Georgia Tech cares. These include a connection to stress management, purpose, financial wellness, mindfulness and social connectedness as well as education on help - seeking and resource navigation. Taking into account the 2014 and 2017 white papers about sexual violence at Georgia Tech coupled with our own data related to the victim -survivor advocacy, VOICE presented and successfully received funding through JAC for two new initiatives that will begin rollout in 2018 -2019: Men Stopping Violence Curriculum Implementation o A team of key campus partners have been trained to facilitate a tw o-hour program to men identified students throughout campus. The program will roll out in Fall 2019 and is designed to give men identified students the resources, confidence, and skills to effectively join into the work of ending sexual violence. Culture o f Respect Collective o Georgia Tech will apply in Fall 2019 to join NASPA's Culture of Respect Collective, an ambitious two -year cohort -based program that evaluates and reorganizes the institution's programs, response, policies, and systems related to sexual violence. As a result of the Campus Services Conversations With focus groups, the Campus Services Satisfaction Survey findings and the success that Georgia Tech had with successfully completing the Partnership for a Healthier Campus Initiative, it was prioritized to make sure that healthy food options are an integral part of the RFP for the new dining vendor. Health Initiatives led the effort by drafting Health and Wellbeing guidelines for food and nutrition. This was the first time that Georgia Tech has had formalized guidelines and expectations for the food service vendors to provide healthy, sustainable food options that can accommodate all students. Specifications include offering more produce, plant -based proteins, whole grains, in house -made, and loc ally sourced options. This is a great example of how Georgia Tech has taken a \"health in all policy\" approach to business decision -making. Progress: Completed 171 Human Resources Business Partner I.

Significant Accomplishments Significant Accomplishments: Office of Student Diversity staff advised the MLK Student Board in planning, financing and implementing the 2019 Civil Right Tour. Seventy students and thirty faculty and staff toured the Civil Rights sites in Montgomery, Selma, and Birmingham, Alabama. While visiting Selma we visited the ruins of Alabama's first state capitol at Old Cahawba Archaeological Park. There we learned about the history of slave ry and Civil War imprisonment. Students, faculty and staff were unified as we marched across the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge, the historic site of Bloody Sunday. While in Birmingham we visited the 16th street Baptist Church and the Birmingham Civil Right s Institute. The 16th street Baptist church was the site where 4 young Black girls died in a bombing while in the bathroom getting ready for Sunday School. The mood was somber, but all tour participants took away new knowledge and understanding. The Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, the Civil Right Memorial Center, the Equal Justice Initiative, the National Memorial for Peace & Justice, the Rosa Parks Museum, the Legacy Museum, and the Freedom Riders Museum were stops on the Montgomery Tour. Nothing could have prepared us for the experiential learning. For example, one of our bus drivers learned his great grandfather and great -great uncle had been lynched while visiting the National Memorial for Peace & Justice. There were no words. Every participant will foreve r be changed. Karen Yiu was nominated for the Excellence in Teaching First -Year Seminars Award for the National Rescore Center for First -Year Experience and Student in Transition. The Office of Student Diversity Programs secured $10,000 from the Joint Allocation Committee for four student life staff members to attend Intergroup Dialogue Institute at the University of Michigan. The Program on intergroup relations (IGR) at the University of Michigan is a social justice education program. IGR blends theory and experiential learning to facilitate student's learning about social group identity, social inequality, and intergroup relations. The program prepares students to live and work in a diverse world and educates them in making choices that advance equity, justice, and peace. IGR was founded in 1988 and was the first program of its kind. IGR is a partnership between Student Life and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. IGR offers seven different courses that are designed with special interests in social diversity and social justice. The courses utilize experiential pedagogy to analyze and understand social conflict, intergroup relations and issues of diversity and justice. The National Institute on Intergroup Dialogue is part of the core work of IGR and is specifically for other institutions who wish to learn \"The Michigan Model\" of Intergroup Dialogue philosophy and techniques for the purpose of creating dialogue programs on their own campuses. Our goal is to implement parts of the model on our campus by Spring 2020. 187 The Office of Student Diversity Programs supported the MLK Student Board in planning and implementing several key programs for the Martin Luther King Jr. Campus Celebration: Our signature event, the campus -wide Student Celebration was held at the Ferst Cen ter for the Arts honoring our theme, \"Bending the Arc Towards Justice.\" The event took place in the Student Center Ballroom, and was attended by 300 students, faculty, staff, and parents. Every year the student celebration aims to commemorate the continuat ion of Dr. King's dream. In addition, 50 student organization representatives lit candles to symbolize that Dr. King's dream continues, and the light must be carried forward for generations to come. The highlight for the evening was the four student speake rs who spoke to the theme of assuming leadership roles to make Dr. King's dream a reality. Each student speaker received gift basket valued at $200 from Barnes & Noble. Other events included the four workshops and events hosted in the Fall Semester to boos t the hype.

In this program, students live together in a residence hall and engage with faculty from a variety of disciplines on a frequent and casual basis. The students also take one academic class per semester together, and in groups of five to seven are ment ored by a faculty member, develop a proposal for a potential solution to a real -world problem. Students in the Grand Challenges Living Learning Community meet regularly with faculty mentors in both formal and informal settings. Leading Edge is a co -curricu lar leadership development experience for undergraduate students where participants work one -on-one with a trained leadership development coach (Georgia Tech PhD / Masters student / faculty / staff) to intentionally explore and enhance their leadership ski lls.

We have achieved between 18 -20% growth year -over-year. The Global Engineering Track continues to be our fastest growing track in the Minor developing engineers who can contribute and lead effectively in domestic and global contexts in solving global grand challenges and other societal problems, working effectively across cultures. Global Leadership Practice (Tokyo Tech) In partnership with Tokyo Institute of Technology, GT LEAD was invited to develop and instruct a Global Leadership Practice course on Working Across Cultures. This course is a two -week intensive course where students from all over the world actively participate in experiential learning activities related to self -evaluation, case studies, organization observation and analysis, speaker visit, final team presentation and individual written 209 reflection report. The goal of this course is to develop individual and team leadership skills within a multi -cultural learning en vironment. Since its inception in Summer 2018, the course impacted 26 students and 6 graduate student teaching assistants (2 - Georgia Tech students). Leading Edge | One -on-One Leadership Coaching The Leading Edge | One -on-One Leadership Coaching program participation continues to grow at a rapid rate thus enabling more students to intentionally explore and develop their leadership skills. To be exact, we have been able to help nearly 1,290 undergraduate students and 310 graduate students sharpen and enha nce their leadership skills since its inception in AY13 -14. 139 graduate students and 78 faculty/staff have developed as leadership coaches in the program. GT 1000 Leadership Sections Over the course of four fall semesters (2015 -2018), we have impacted a total of 67 faculty/staff instructors, 17 graduate student fellows, 135 student Team Leaders, and nearly 1,000 students with a leadership development experience; thus improving outcomes in student organizations, team projects, augmenting and supplementing technical degrees, preparing students for professional life and providing a way for GT1000 to continuously evolve. In April 2019, we conducted psychological safety workshops for the Team leaders to increase engagement in the classroom. In Summer 2019, we offered (4) iGniTe leadership sections.

Institutional Effectiveness Changes within Unit: Grand Challenges Living Learning Community The Grand Challenges assessment team monitors the progress of Grand Challenges by evaluating program goals through quantitative data collection, focus groups, anecdotal data, and observation. Initial findings from the quantitative data indicate GCLLC students have a more productive and enriched first -year experience than their non -GC peers at Georgia Tech. Qualitative data (e.g. focus g roups, survey free response, etc.) suggest a greater sense of pride and shared community among the GCLLC students. This sense of community appears to be correlated to increased self -confidence and feelings of academic empowerment amongst the GCLLC student s. These students further demonstrate evidence of positive student/faculty engagement through social interaction at GCLLC sponsored faculty events. Quantitative data indicates that GCLLC students earn higher first year and second year GPA than do their non -GC peers. Through the Division of Student Life, the Center for Academic Enrichment, and the College of Engineering, Grand Challenges expanded to reach 200 first -year students in the Fall 2018. The Grand Challenges Living Learning Community continues to provide like-minded students with the opportunity to tackle the world's Grand Challenges and develop the skills to become highly effective team members. Students enhance their problem solving, analytical, and critical thinking skills, and their ability to give and receive critical feedback within a diverse team environment. Grand Challenges partnered with the assessment team within the Center for Academic Enrichment to conduct a student survey at the end of Spring 2019. All living learning community partici pants were asked to complete the survey and respond to free response questions in regard to five shared living learning community outcomes. The Grand Challenges focus group conducted in March 2019 did not yield enough significant qualitative data to comple te a thorough analysis. For AY19 -20, Grand Challenges will conduct a minimum of two focus groups for our first -year participants and one focus group for our second years. Leading Edge / Leadership Development The LEAD Office monitors the progress of Leadin g Edge by evaluating program goals 215 through surveys, anecdotal data, and observation. The data collected is vital in providing insights into what changes should be made each year. Based on feedback from the prior year's training, we adjusted leadership coac hing training to further focus on more practical aspects of coaching and started building coaching skills at the onset of training. For the participants in this training, we continued to see an improvement in the quality of coaching in the field. For those that participated in the monthly meetings and took advantage of peer coaching relationship, personal leadership development growth and sharing of best practices were key benefits. Fellows clearly understand that leadership/coaching requires commitment to personal development & hard work. Igniting coaching conversations (especially when students do not have a leadership role), asking curious questions (without a solution in mind), aiding students with experiment development, and the importance of progress a nd follow -up seem to be areas of opportunity for further refinement. Since our Fellows expressed desire in the prior year to use existing tools to facilitate coaching engagement tracking (taking handwritten notes, emailing agendas, using existing calendars , Slack for messaging) in lieu of an online coaching solution, we allowed the Coaches | Coachees to implement their own strategy for their coaching engagements. Pods were launched in September 2018 (with experienced Fellows as pod leaders) to gather qual itative data from the field, foster additional support and develop community with the Coach cohort. Pod leaders captured feedback from their pod participants in order to assess | adjust quality of interactions in the field, provided real time one -on-one coaching opportunities for coach development and growth, determined training topics that would be covered in the AY18 -19 Leadership Fellows Monthly Meetings, and coordinated a social event to build community within the cohort. In order to get our Fellows up to speed more quickly, we developed a training arc for the AY18 -19 cohort. This included preliminary training prior to retreat, an intensive follow -up to retreat along with a clear trajectory of learning outcomes and training throughout the academic year. In addition, we pulled together a toolbox to help coaches when they would like to uncover more growth opportunities for their Coachees. This toolbox will be added to our new Canvas site that we are rolling out in Fall 2019. SLACKShop, online workshops that facilitate professional leadership / coaching development to meet the needs of our One -on-One Leadership Coaching Community will continue. We had great success with them last year and they encouraged further engagement with the coaches. Each facilitated w orkshop offers a rich multimedia learning experience with no scheduled meeting times. Bite -sized tasks are structured to encourage collaboration, discussion and learning. Anytime/anywhere over a one -week period. Incorporating workshops around weaknesses in coaching will be the primary focus. We will also consider opening these up to Coachees as well when we begin group coaching in the Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 semesters. 216 There continues to be a growing demand for leadership development on campus. As long as there is demand, we will continue to improve existing programs and develop new ones that fit the needs of the student body. With the growth, we have taken the initiative to empower and train more faculty/staff (GT 1000), undergraduate and graduate student s to deliver workshops within their organizations, colleges and beyond. In the Fall of 2019, we are looking to re -evaluate our assessment strategy with a graduate student who will evaluate various scales for competency development and growth trajectories. Minor in Leadership Studies Currently, the LEAD Office monitors the enrollment figures of the Minor in Leadership Studies by monitoring program/track acceptances from semester to semester. In addition, sourcing data is collected to better understand what m arketing channels are most effective. The data collected is vital in providing insights into what changes should be made each year. Data indicates that enrollment remains on a steady incline (over 20% increase in applications from the previous year). The m ajority of students are learning about the Minor through GT Staff and Students (23%), Academic Advisors (18%) and the Eastern and Central Student Abroad experience (18%). We are continuing to see a slight shift in students declaring the Minor earlier in th eir Georgia Tech careers (sophomores), however, the majority of students declare the Minor when they are in their Junior and Senior year. While we are continuing to place more targeted marketing messaging in place, we believe getting in front of students i n their first -year with the appropriate messaging will highlight the importance of pursuing the Minor earlier in their Georgia Tech careers. In this light, we are coordinating the 1st annual campus -wide Minor Fair and Showcase in October 2019. A \"2019 Summ er College Minor Roadshow\" is planned so we can get meet minor advisors from all colleges to encourage their participation and gather their ideas on how to make this an impactful event for students. Since more students have also expressed the desire to gat her in community, we are planning a 2019 Fall Semester Minor Social (Alumni, Faculty, Staff and Students) to create community and generate interest in all 3 tracks on the Minor, and a 2020 Spring Minor Graduation Dinner to recognize our graduates. In AY1 8-19 our marketing and outreach strategy focused on a more targeted approach to colleges, faculty, staff, students and advisors. Our college partners played a huge role in this. Moving forward into AY18 -19, we will increase our engagement with the Minor Fa ir & Showcase, Minor Social, GT 1000, professors (specifically one that teach classes that are included in the Minor and those that stimulate interest in leadership development), and students, enhance business course offerings, share more leadership storie s within and outside of partner colleges, and build a stronger community within the cohort. In addition, we are rolling out a new validated assessment to assess skill development gains along with a longitudinal study to assess impact of the Minor beyond Tech. Identifying the need to assess to assess our students beyond graduation, we have decided to conduct a thorough review of the learning outcomes for each of the Minor 217 classes and explore a longitudinal study. Once this has been developed and rolled out, we are hoping that the information that we uncover will not only inform improvements to this academic program, but also allow us to capture alumni testimonials that we can utilize to target current students in their specific fields of study. GT 1000 Leadership Sections The Center for Academic Enrichment in partnership with the Office of Leadership Education and Development revised the leadership program to include a one -day training for all instructors teaching a leadership -themed section of GT 1000, conducted check -ins with the instructors, and allowed instructors the choice to opt into the leadership themed sections with/without a hybrid teaching model with a trained Leadership Fellow. Two leadership instructors opted into the Leadership Fellows mode l while the rest engaged in the one -day training session to integrate the leadership concepts into their course curriculum. LEAD Staff was available to assist with the integration. In addition, we continued to support the Summer iGniTe program with four iGniTe leadership sections. Over the past few years, we have conducted a pre -and-post leadership capacity survey to explore the degree to which participants in GT 1000 report changes in leadership self-efficacy, motivation to lead and leadership skills. The Pre-and-Post Leadership Capacity Survey explores the degree to which participants in GT 1000 report changes in leadership self -efficacy, motivation to lead and leadership skills. Dr. Kari Keating, Dr. David Rosch and Lisa Burgoon from the University of Ill inois have done some great work in this area and have written an article on the development of effective leadership capacity entitled \"Developmental Readiness for Leadership: The Differential Effects of Leadership Courses on Creating, 'Ready, Willing and Able' Leaders\".* With their permission, we conducted similar pre -and-post surveys to measure the development of our student's leadership capacity within all LEAD programs. Given that the quantitative data clearly demonstrated consistent and significant gain s in readiness - confidence in engaging in leadership Behaviors (SEL), willingness - degree to which a person is drawn to leadership roles (MTL AI) and avoidance of rationally calculating cost/benefit of leadership position (MTL NC), and ability - Generalize d transformational (LBS FORM) leadership skills and the support to the notion that the leadership development treatment is continuing to have its intended effect, with the shift of integrating leadership learning outcomes into the standard GT 1000 curriculu m, the move away from the hybrid model, along with a focus on distributing materials | general guidelines for instructors we have moved away from this assessment all together. In AY19 -20, the Center for Academic Enrichment will continue to assess all theme d sections and we are seeking alternative scales/methods to support adjustments in the leadership themed sections. 218 In February 2019, Stacey Doremus had the opportunity to give a plenary address* to the First -Year Experience Conference in Las Vegas, NV in F ebruary 2019. Feedback from participants identified needs and desires to incorporate leadership development into their first -year experiences with a number of follow -ups conducted with universities around the country. *DISCOVER | Create lasting impact, p ropel learning and develop momentum towards future action. The most influential education experiences are ones that are remembered, and more importantly, propel us to take some form of action. There is a growing demand for leadership skills that embrace complex, dynamic, and chaotic contemporary contexts. One response to this demand has been arts -based methods of leadership education. Learn how one instructor shares in the intellectual and exploratory growth of her first - year students through a guided discovery learning framework that allows students the freedom to explore, collaborate more effectively, take risks and transcend limitations. Teams for Tech In Spring 2019, LEAD held its first annual Teams for Tech IDEAS Competition where undergradua te and graduate teams pitch their ideas on a product, service, project or venture concept to enhance life at Georgia Tech. Working closely with campus and external partners, we advanced 10 teams to a year -long engagement where they will work with a team le adership coach to understand and analyze their role on the team and the team itself, gain experience in leadership situations, recognizing that leadership happens up and down the organizational ladder, give back to the campus community, apply problem -solving skills to difficult team dynamics, and ultimately, implement their idea. For the upcoming academic year, we will conduct focus groups in February 2020. Global Leadership Practice | Working Across Cultures (Tokyo Tech) In partnership with Tokyo Institu te of Technology, GT LEAD was invited to develop and instruct a Global Leadership Practice course on Working Across Cultures. This course is a two -week intensive course where students from all over the world actively participate in experiential learning ac tivities related to self -evaluation, case studies, organization observation and analysis, speaker visit, final team presentation and individual written reflection report. The goal of this course is to develop individual and team leadership skills within a multi -cultural learning environment. Since its inception in Summer 2018, the course impacted 26 students and 6 graduate student teaching assistants (2 - Georgia Tech students). 219 In evaluating the qualitative data within the individual written reports we can see that students are moving away from viewing leadership as power and authority to the notion that leadership can be studied, learned and practiced by everyone. As students progressed through the course, they gained more self -awareness around their stren gths, weaknesses, values, unconscious and conscious bias and their own cultural perspectives giving them the ability to affirm their voice and align their actions to their authentic selves. In developing trust and seeking understanding from their internati onal classmates, they were able to identify similarities and differences in a variety of leadership dimensions and identified what makes multi -cultural teams effective while testing solutions real -time as common team challenges occurred. Increased vulnerab le-based trust, leadership self - efficacy, communication skills, confidence, motivation to lead, initiative and risk -taking, along with embracing challenges and failures were common themes presented throughout the reflections. The desire to grow and develop beyond the course was apparent. Direct quotes from students in the class: \"I was convinced that leaders have to be charismatic in order to be followed. However, I found that leadership could be studied, practiced and learned\" \"Diversity enriches people\" \"failures are valuable because we can use negative feedback as resources for improving ourselves\" \"The ability to learn, grow and change continuously is essential in our world where technology is improving fast. As a result, I will continue studying and pr acticing efficient global leadership practices.\" \"[Before this class] I tended to avoid chances to take initiatives and risks. However, now I know my leadership strengths and what I can do.\" \"Sharing values and knowledge is important to be free from biases .\" \"I am eager to put myself out of my comfort zone to grow and see a new world\" Tokyo Tech is currently evaluating a pre -and-post leadership capacity survey to explore the degree to which participants in this course report changes in leadership self - efficacy, motivation to lead and leadership skills. The Pre -and-Post Leadership Capacity Survey explores the degree to which participants in the Global Leadership Practice Course report changes in leadership self -efficacy, motivation to lead and leadership skills. Dr. Kari Keating, Dr. David Rosch and Lisa Burgoon from the University of Illinois have done some great work in this area and have written an article on the development of effective leadership capacity entitled \"Developmental Readiness for Leadership: The Differential Effects of Leadership Courses on Creating, 'Ready, Willing and Able' Leaders\".* 220 In addition, Tokyo Tech is in the process of assessing students' growth and development based on a pre -and-post Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ). The Multicultural Personality Questionnare (MPQ) was developed by Dr. Karen I. Van der Zee and Dr. Jan Pieter Van Oudenhoven. MPQ was planned to be utilized as a questionnaire aimed at measuring multicultural effectiveness. It is composed of seven scales. They are Cultural Empathy, Openmindness, Emotional Stability, Orientation to Action, Adventurousness/Curiosity, Flexibility, and Extraversion. Once we receive these results, we will share the results with stakeholders. As we move into Summer 2020, it i s important to note that Tokyo Tech is looking to incorporate this class into their leadership certificate program along with publishing an article around the course impact.

Significant Accomplishments Unit Description: The Office of the Arts embeds creative experiences into the lives and learning of Georgia Tech students, the broader campus community, and Greater Atlanta. Along with the goals of Activating, Enga ging and Producing, the Office is responsible for managing the Ferst Center for the Arts. Significant Accomplishments: Activate - The process of enriching the campus with the arts. Office of the Arts programming and coordination assistance reached over 200 0 Georgia Tech students this year. This number reflects activity across all areas of our programming spectrum: performances, academic involvement, special projects, art and technology collaborations, and student activities guided by our office. Additional to this participation number are the thousands of students involved in artistic pursuits individually, in student cultural and performance groups, through the School of Music and other departments, in literary and creative digital media work, and enjoying the public art on campus every day. Specific coordination by the Office of the Arts included: Another Faculty and Staff Art Exhibition was held at the Ferst Center in November 2018, featuring work by 40 artists from across campus. I Feel Safe When, an ong oing project of the Office of the Arts, prompted personal reflection and story -telling around the idea of personal safety and well - being. Distributed at summer FASET sessions, the responses were developed as a play through DramaTech in Fall 2018. Staff ha s been involved all year getting ready for the Sculpture unveiling next September 2019. Fun and free events happened outside of the Ferst Center for the Arts because of the renovation in the theatre. As a result, six fun and free events featured all over c ampus were very successful including: Out of Hand Theatre's The RATS Hunt; Dahlak Brathwaite Spiritrials; Bandaloop (as part of Parent & Family 228 Programs); Duet for Theremin and Lap Steel; Out of Hand Theatre's Zombie Outbreak, and Cardell Dance's Supper, P eople on the Move. Engage - Deepening participation in the arts by students is one of the primary goals of the Office of the Arts. This year saw tremendous progress and opportunities for Georgia Tech students in developing and participating in creative pursuits. The two -year project, Creative Curricular Initiatives (CCI), which embedded artists in classrooms across campus and supported faculty and students in developing curricular -related arts projects concluded this year. Project leaders became Arts Fel lows who received mentorship and became part of the Arts Council. The Findings Group provided 3 statistical reports over the two -year period about art and creativity on a STEM campus concluding with the recent report included in the assessment section. ACCelerate Creativity and Innovation Festival - 12 students competed for four final project spots in this festival, which celebrated the intersection of art, creativity and technology and was held at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington in April 2019. The annual student Art Crawl exhibition featured the work of 150 student artists. Produce - The Office of the Arts is committed to supporting and producing original work at the intersection of art and technology, in a program titled Arts@Tech. The Office of the Arts assisted Georgia Tech student Raianna Brown in producing her dance piece Komanse as part of the Arts@Tech season. Production assistance was provided in several areas: technical, marketing, ticketing, and engagement. Her piece reflec ted Science, Engineering, Art, and Design (SEAD) programming.

Institutional Effectiveness Changes within Unit: The combination of attrition of the staff and the renovation of the theatre made FY19 a difficult year for the Office of the Arts. There was no Assistant Director who manages financials and HR until November 2018. Just as the theatre was to reopen, the \"de luge\" water system flooded the stage. Luckily, none of the new renovated seats were affected 234 but all the audio equipment was ruined which required us to rent audio equipment until insurance and procurement replaced our systems. The Director left in Janua ry. The Marketing Manager became the Interim Director and retired at the end of May 2019. The new Assistant Director took over as Interim Director by June 4. In addition, the departure of the Marketing Specialist in October, who was in charge of the digita l effort, right before launching the Arts@Tech Season which was purely art at the intersection of technology, wasn't in place to add the digital marketing necessary to sell the dedicated technological season. That position was filled in February and the re st of the Season has been smoother. By July 15, our new Director will be in place and by August 1, the new Marketing Manager will be in place.

FIRST -YEAR COUNCIL (FC) Although First -Year Council (FC) has a long -standing history within New Student & Transition Programs, recent concerns about the health and safety of the organiza tion and its members caused the office to remove its departmental support.
