Welcome Thank you for being part of the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield (Anthem) provider network. At Anthem, we understand that the most important work you do is taking care of your patients. The administrative aspect of medicine is also vitally important, but it shouldn't impede your ability to deliver high -quality health care. That's why we've created this Companion Guide for Billing Professional, I nstitutional and Ancillary Claims , divided into three section s. You and your organization play a critical role in managing the care of our member s, so we know how important it is to have all the information you need at your fingertips. If you have any questions about billing or any other topic, you can contact your Network Relations consultant or call Provider Services at the following numbers: Hoosier Healthwise \u2014 1-866-408-6132 Healthy Indiana Plan \u2014 1-844-533-1995 Hoosier Care Connect \u2014 1-844-284-1798 Section 1 : Professional Claims Providers can depend upon efficient claims handling and faster reimbursement when they follow Anthem's professional billing requirements. These requirements include using standardized codes for most of our health services. This section is broken down into health service categories to help you find the specific billing codes you'll need for each one. You will also find information on the proper method for filling out the CMS -1500 claim form. For the most efficient claims processing, accurately filled -out claims are essential. Follow these general guidelines for claims filing: Indicate the provider's National Provider Identifier (NPI) number in Box 24J of the CMS -1500 form. Missing or invalid numbers may result in n onpayment. Mid-level practitioners should put their NPI number in Box 19 of the CMS -1500 and the supervising Provider's NPI number in Box 24J. The following types of practitioners are defined as mid-level: o Physician Assistants o Nurse Practitioners o Certified Nurse Midwives Hoosier Healthwise , Hoosier Care Connect: Use the alpha prefix YRH along with the 12 -digit Member number provided by the State Healthy Indiana Plan: Use the alpha prefix YRK along with the 9 -digit Member Anthem ID number Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) may put their billing/group NPI number in Box 24J and 33. Coding In order to process claims in an orderly and consistent manner, we use standardized codes. The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), sometimes referred to as National Codes, provides coding f or a wide variety of services. There are two principal coding levels, referred to as Level I and Level II: Level I: Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA) . These c odes are represented by 5 numeric digits . Level II: Codes that identify products, supplies and services not included in the CPT codes, such as ambulance supplies and Durable Medical Equipment (DME). These are sometimes called alphanumeric codes because the y consist of a single alphabetical letter followed by 4 numeric digits . In some cases, 2 -digit/character modifier codes should accompany the Level I or Level II coding . There are two useful reference guides for coding claims: The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) manual, published by the American Medical Association. To order, call 1-800-621-8335 . The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). To order, call 1-800-621-8335 . Anthem does not accept global billing codes. If Anthem receives a claim with global coding, it will be denied requesting a corrected claim be submitted using itemized codes. National Drug Codes Providers must include National Drug Codes (NDCs), Unit of Measurement and Quantity of Drug on all claims that include physician -administered drugs. This applies to dr ugs dispensed in both professional and institutional outpatient settings. The NDC is an 11 -digit number on the package or container from which medication is administered. The Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) require s that Anthem report the National Drug Code information to the FSSA every month. Anthem will deny professional and outpatient institutional claims containing physician -administered drugs if any of the following elements are missing or invalid: NDCs Unit of Measurement Quantity of Drug Providers should follow instructions outlined in the Claims and Billing Procedures Modules in the IHCP Provider Reference Modules . To determine which procedure codes require the inclusion of an NDC, providers may access the Codes Sets page at www.in.gov/medicaid/providers/693.htm . Select Launch Provider Code, click \"Accept\", then choose Procedure Codes That Require NDCs. Initial Health Assessments Anthem primary medical providers functi on as a member's \"medical home .\" For that reason, we strongly recommend that an initial health assessment (IHA) consisting of a complete history and physical and preventive services be conducted within the first 90 days of enrollment. When billing for init ial health assessments, use the following International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes: Z00.121 -Z00.129 for children (newborn to 20 years old) Z00.00 -Z00.01 for adults (19 years and older) The member can also complete the Health Needs Scr eening and receive an incentive online at www.anthem.com/hns or over the phone by calling 1-866-408-6131 for Hoosier Healthwise and Healthy Indiana Plan or 1-844-284-1797 for Hoosier Care Connect . Preventive Medici ne Services: New Patient Preventive medicine services for a new patient start with an initial comprehensive preventive medicine evaluation. That includes an age and gender -appropriate history, examination, counseling, risk factor interventions, and the ord ering of appropriate immunizations, laboratory and diagnostic procedures. Bill for these services using the following codes: Code Description 99381 Infant (Under 1 Year) 99382 Early Childhood (Ages 1 -4) 99383 Late Childhood (Ages 5 -11) 99384 Adolescent (Ages 12 -17) 99385 Ages 18 -39 99386 Ages 40 -64 99387 Age 65 and older Preventive Medicine Services: Established Patient Preventive medicine services for an established patient involve re -evaluation and management of existing conditions, if any. That includes an age and gender -appropriate history, examination, counseling, risk factor interventions, and the ordering of appropriate immunizations, laboratory and diagnostic procedures. Code Description 99391 Infant (Under 1 Year) 99392 Early Childhood (Ages 1 -4) 99393 Late Childhood (Ages 5 -11) 99394 Adolescent (Ages 12 -17) 99395 Ages 18 -39 99396 Ages 40 -64 99397 Ages 65 and older Self-Referable Services Members may access the following services at any time without pre -authorization or referral by their primary medical provider: Behavioral Health Services (Hoosier Healthwise, Healthy Indiana Plan and Hoosier Care Connect) o Psychiatric Services: Anthem members may self -refer to any IHCP -enrolled behavioral health services psychiatrist. o Behavioral Health Services not rendered by a psychiatrist: Anthem members may self -refer to any in -network Behavioral Health Services provider, including behavioral health, substance abuse and chemical dependency Chiropractic Services (Hoosier Healthwise, HIP Maternity, HIP Plus, HIP members with State Plan Benefits, Hoosier Care Connect) Diabetes Self -Care Training (Hoosier Healthwise, Healthy Indiana Plan, Hoosier Care Connect) Emergency Services (Hoosier Healthwis e, Healthy Indiana Plan, Hoosier Care Connect) Eye and Vision Care, except surgery (Hoosier Healthwise, HIP Plus, HIP Maternity, HIP Basic members ages 19 and 20 or pregnant, and HIP members with State Plan Benefits, Hoosier Care Connect) Family Planning (Hoosier Healthwise, Healthy Indiana Plan, Hoosier Care Connect) Podiatry (routine foot care is not covered for Hoosier Healthwise Package C) Vaccines (Hoosier Healthwise, Healthy Indiana Plan, Hoosier Care Connect) Behavioral Health Anthem has contracted with a network of hospitals, group practices and independent behavioral health providers, as well as a number of Indiana's Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) to provide behavioral health services. Providers rendering medically necessary behavioral hea lth services should bill Anthem using behavioral health CPT codes. Emergency and Related Professional Services Emergency services, as defined by state and local law, the provider contract and our Member Handbook , are reimbursed in accordance with the Anthe m provider contract. Authorizations are not required for medically necessary emergency services. Emergency: Any condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity such that a layperson possessing an average knowledge of health and medicine could reasonably expect that the absence of immediate medical care could: Place the member's health or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman and her unborn child, in serious jeopardy Cause serious impairment to bodily function s Cause serious dysfunction to any bodily organ or part Covered Emergency Services include: Hospital -based emergency department services (room and ancillary) needed to evaluate or stabilize the emergency medical or behavioral health condition Services by e mergency providers Emergency Services Copayment If a member receives treatment in a hospital emergency room for a nonemergent condition, a copayment of $8 for HIP members and $3 for Hoosier Care Connect is required. Members are not required to pay the copay if they call Anthem's 24/7 NurseLine first and are advised to go to the ER. For HIP members, POWER Account funds cannot be used by the member to pay the copayment. The copayment requirement will be w aived according to prudent layperson guidelines. If Anthem determines through the claims process that the copayment should not have been charged, and the hospital collected a copayment, you must refund the copayment to the member. Providers shall not coll ect copayments for emergency room visits resulting in an inpatient admission. Related professional services offered by providers during an emergency room visit are reimbursed according to your Anthem provider contract. Assuming the member has an available and accessible non -emergency services provider, and a determination has been made that the member does not have an emergent condition, the hospital must inform the member before providing nonemergency services of the following: The hospital may require a copayment before the service can be provided The hospital will provide the name and location of an alternate non -emergency services provider who is actually available and accessible An alternate provider can provide the services without a copayment The hos pital will provide a referral to coordinate scheduling of services All members should be referred back to their primary medical provider for follow -up care. Unless clinically required, follow -up care should never occur in a hospital emergency room. Hospita ls will be reimbursed for emergency services billed with codes: 99284 , 99285 Hospitals may only bill Revenue Code 451 if the emergency room screening determines that the visit is nonemergent. Hospital reimbursement will be reduced by 40% f or services billed with codes: 99281 99283 2021 Vaccines for Children Immunizations Covered Anthem network providers who administer vaccines to children 0 -18 years of age may enroll in the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which provides free vaccine products to providers . Anthem will only reimburse the administration fee - limited to the lesser of the billed amount or $ 15, unless otherwise identified in the provider contract - for any vaccine available through the VFC progr am. Correct billing includes: ICD-10 routine child health check code (see Z00.121, Z00.129) as the primary diagnosis code, with the applicable vaccine ICD -10 code in the secondary, tertiary or other position. Specific vaccine or combination vaccine admin istered by using the appropriate vaccine product procedure code with a billed amount of $0. Vaccine administration code with modifier SL as the first modifier. Other applicable modifiers would be appended after the SL. o 90471 SL: Immunization administration (includes percutaneous, intradermal, subcutaneous one vaccine vaccine/toxoid); VFC vaccine administration o 90472 SL: Each additional vaccine (single or combination v accine/toxoid); VFC vaccine administration o 90473 SL: Immunization administration by intranasal or oral route; one vaccine (single or combination vaccine/toxoid); VFC vaccine administration o 90474 SL: Each additional vaccine by intranasal or oral route (si ngle or combination vaccine/toxoid); VFC vaccine administration Use the CMS -1500 form: On one line of Box 24D, use the appropriate CPT code On another line of Box 24D, use the appropriate administration procedure code In Box 23, insert the primary medic al provider name Immunizations Not Covered The IHCP allows separate reimbursement for the vaccine product and administration fee for vaccines that are not part of the VFC program. Providers should report these services following the billing guidelines abov e, except: Use the appropriate ICD -10 for the encounter. Report the specific vaccine or combination vaccine administered by using the appropriate vaccine product procedure code with your usual and customary charge. Use the CMS -1500 form: On one line of Box 24D, use the appropriate CPT code On another line of Box 24D, use the appropriate administration procedure code The SL modifier is not required Additional Services during EPSDT Exams If a patient is evaluated and treated for a problem during the same visit as an EPSDT annual exam or well-child visit, the problem -oriented exam can be billed separately if accompanied by the 25 modifier. The problem must require additional moderate level evaluation to qualify as a separate service on the same date. Mater nity Services Maternity services are covered by the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) through the HIP Maternity plan. There are no copays for maternity services and once a member is verified to be pregnant, she will have no copays for any services, and no POWER A ccount contribution. Maternity services also continue to be a covered benefit for Hoosier Healthwise and Hoosier Care Connect. Please refer to the IHCP Reference Modules for detailed instructions. You can access the state's reference modules at https://www.in.gov/medicaid/providers/469.htm . Anthem requires itemization of maternity services when submitting claims for reimbursement. Please use the CMS -1500 claim form with the appropriate CPT and H CPCS codes, along with ICD diagnosis codes. This includes the applicable evaluation and management (E&M) code, along with coding for all other procedures performed. Maternity billing guidelines are as follows: Anthem reimburses only one delivery or cesarean section procedure per member in a 7 -month period. Reimbursement includes multiple births. Delivering providers who perform regional anesthesia or nerve block may not receive additional reimbursement because these charges are included i n the reimbursement for the delivery. Anthem reimburses anesthesia services and delivery at full allowance when provided by the delivering obstetrician. Anthem will reimburse antepartum care, deliveries including cesarean sections performed by physicians, and postpartum care: o Codes 59409, 59514, 59612 and 59620 : Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries o Code 59430 : Postpartum care only (if in the inpatient setting within 21 days following delivery , the claim will deny unless submitted with medical records document ing the patient received services represented by this code as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics ) o Code 59425 : Antepartum care only (2 -6 visits) o Code 59426 : Antepartum care only (7 or m ore visits) When billing Anthem, you must itemize each service individually and submit claims as the services are rendered. The filing deadline will be applied to each individual date of service submitted. Providers must bill the procedure code for the vis it in conjunction with the appropriate U1, U2, or U3 modifier to identify prenatal visits in each trimester for each specific date of service: o U1 - Trimester one - 0 through 14 weeks, 0 days o U2 - Trimester two - 14 weeks, 1 day through 28 weeks, 0 days o U3 - Trimester three - 28 weeks, 1 day through delivery Laboratory (including pregnancy test) and radiology services provided during pregnancy must be billed separately and be received by Anthem within 90 days from the date of service. Use of the appropri ate antepartum or postpartum CPT codes is necessary for appropriate reimbursement. You should indicate the estimated date of confinement (EDC) on the CMS -1500 claim form. If a member is admitted to the hospital during the course of her pregnancy, the diag nosis necessitating the admission should be the primary diagnosis on the claim. If high risk, the high -risk diagnosis must be documented on the claim form. The nature of a high -risk care visit must be identified in the diagnosis field on the CMS -1500 claim form, or the appropriate field. For professional claims only, the date of the member's last menstrual period must be included. Claims for Obstetric Deliveries Require a Modifier Deliveries performed prior to 39 weeks and zero days will be covered only wh en certain approved, medically necessary indications, including spontaneous early labor/delivery, are present and documented. One of the following modifiers will be required on the CMS -1500 claim form when billing with CPT codes are not covered. UA: Nonmedically necessary deliveries prior to 39 weeks, zero days of gestation; if the delivery does not meet the IHCP's stated guidelines for approved medically necessary deliveries (please refer to Obstetrical and Gynecological Services in the IHCP Provider References Modules for approved conditions), the claim will automatically deny. The right to appeal is retained. UB: Medically necessary deliveries prior to 39 weeks, zero days; deliveries resulting from spontaneous labor/delivery or inductions or cesarean sections w ith a documented IHCP - approved medical indication (please refer to IHCP Bulletin BT 201421 for approved indications). o Claims with the UB modifier and one of the diagnosis codes on the Medical Necessity Code List will pay (you may find this list at www.anthem.com/inmedicaiddoc > Prior Authorization & Claims > Prior Authorization > Forms and other resources ). o If a claim is submitted with the UB modifier but without a code from the Medical Necessity Code List , medical records demonstrating medical necessity for delivery must be submitted with the claim. Please verify that diagnosis codes indicating spontaneous labor prior to 39 weeks, zero days are included. Submitted medical records will be reviewed prior to payment to determine if the delivery was medically necessary and the claim will pay or deny accordingly. In the case of denial, the provider retains the right to appeal. o If a claim is submitted with the UB modifier but there is no diagnosis code on the cla im from the Medical Necessity Code List , and no records are submitted with the claim, the claim will deny. The provider will have the right to appeal and may submit medical records at that time. UC: Deliveries at 39 weeks, zero days of gestation or later , regardless of method (induction, cesarean section or spontaneous labor); these claims will automatically pay. Cesarean Sections Medicaid restricts any Cesarean section, labor induction, or any delivery following labor induction to one of the following additional criteria: Gestational age of the fetus should be determined to be at least 39 weeks or fetal lung maturity must be estab lished before delivery. When the delivery occurs prior to 39 weeks, maternal and/or fetal conditions must dictate medical necessity for the delivery. Cesarean sections, labor inductions, or any deliveries following labor induction that occur prior to 39 weeks of gestation and are not considered medically necessary will be denied. Records will be subject to retrospective review. Payments made for non -medically -indicated Cesarean section, labor induction, or any delivery following labor induction that fails to meet these criteria, (as determined by review of medical documentation) will be subject to claim recoupment. Recoupment may apply to all services related to the delivery, including additional provider and hospital fees. Newborns Submit newborn claims to Anthem for Hoosier Healthwise using the state -issued Medicaid ID number of the newborn. Do not use the temporary ID numbers (those ending with NB followed by one or more digits). Anthem rejects claims with temporary ID numbers. You will also need to submit the name, date of birth and other pertinent information about the newborn. To prevent any lapse in Anthem coverage for newborns, please ask your patients to take these important steps as soon as their babies are born: Immediately contact the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) or their social worker to request the required paperwork Fill out and return the required paperwork to the state to enroll their newborn in Medicaid Anthem requests that you notify us of all deliveries within three days of delivery . Use the Newborn Enrollment Notification Report found on our website at www.anthem.com/inmedicaiddoc under Provider Support > Helping Members > Maternal Services. Also notify An them via the Newborn Enrollment Notification Report referenced above when you receive a newborn's permanent Medicaid ID number. Hospitals may bill for newborn delivery and other newborn services separately from the claims for services they provide for the mother. Circumcision All circumcisions performed on members more than 30 days after birth will require authorization from the plan's Utilization Management department and will be subject to medical necessity. On-Call Services On-call services can be billed when the rendering physician is not the primary medical provider, b ut is covering for or has received permission from the primary medical provider to provide service that day. Insert On-Call for primary medical provider on the CMS -1500 claim form. Sterilization and Hysterectomy Sterilization and hysterectomy procedures m ust comply with federal rules and regulations noted in 42 CFR 441.250 -441.259 and 405 IAC 5 -28-8 and 405 IAC 5 -28-9. Sterilizations Sterilization renders a person unable to reproduce. Anthem reimburses for sterilizations when the consent form accompanies all claims connected with the service for men and women according to 405 IAC 5 -28-8. Providers must note partial sterilization on the face of the claim form, preferably on the line below the HCPCS procedure code. For sterilizations performed at the time of delivery, providers must bill with a 59 modifier. A sterilization form is not necessary when a provider renders a patient sterile as a result of an illness or injury. The physician must attach a certification to the claim indicating that the sterilization occurred due to an illness or injury when prior acknowledgement was not possible. The provider must also include a description of the nature of the emergency. Limitations Anthem may reimburse for the sterilization of an individual only if that individual meets the following requirements: Is 21 years old or over at the time the informed consent is given, 42 CFR 441.253 Is neither mentally incompetent nor institutionalized, 42 CFR 441.251 Has voluntarily given informed consent, 42 CFR 441.2 57 through 441.258 For claims submitted with the procedure codes and diagnosis codes shown in Table 8.182, the IHCP suspends the claims for an analyst to review the consent form or documentation of partial sterilization. Procedure Codes That Suspend for Analyst Review of Consent Form Procedure Code Description 00851 Anesthesia for intraperitoneal procedures in lower abdomen including ligation/transection 00921 procedures); vasectomy, unilateral or bilateral 55250 Vasectomy, unilateral procedure) including postoperative 58565 Hysteroscopy, surgical; with bilateral fallopian tube to occlusion by placement of permanent implants 58570 * Laparoscopy, su rgical, with total hysterectomy, for uterus 250g or less 58571 * Laparoscopy, surgical, with total hysterectomy, for uterus 250g or less; with removal of tube(s) and/or ovary(s) 58572 * Laparoscopy, surgical, with total hysterectomy, for uterus greater than 250g 58573 * Laparoscopy, surgical, with total hysterectomy, for uterus greater than 250g; with removal of ovary(s) 58600 Ligation or transection of fallopian or bilateral 58605 Ligation or transection of fallopian tube(s), abdominal or vaginal approach, postpartum, unilateral or bilateral, during same hospitalization (sep arate procedure) 58611 Ligation or transection of fallopian tube(s) when done at the time of cesarean section or intra - abdominal surgery (not a separate procedure) (List separately in addition to code for primary procedure) 58615 Occlusion of fallopi an tube(s) by device (e.g., band, Falope ring) vaginal or suprapubic approach 58661 Laparoscopy, surgical; with removal of salpingectomy) 58670 surgical; with occlusion of oviducts by band, clip, or Falope ring) A4264 Miscellaneous DME supply, accessory and/or service component of another HCPCS code *Requires an Acknowledgement of Receipt of Hysterectomy Form with the claims. Hysteroscopic sterilizations with an implant device provide a non -incision permanent sterilization option. Anthem covers this procedure for eligible female members 21 years old an d older. This procedure can be performed in the office, as an outpatient, or in an ambulatory surgical center (ASC). Providers should bill the procedure using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 58565 - Hysteroscopy, surgical; with bilateral fallopi an tube cannulation to induce occlusion by placement of permanent implants . However, CPT code 58579 - Unlisted hysteroscopy procedure, uterus is not appropriate billing for the hysteroscopic sterilization procedure with an implant device, and claims will suspend for manual review. The implant device must be billed separately on the CMS -1500 claim form using HCPCS code A 4264 - Miscellaneous DME supply, accessory and/or service component of another HCPCS code . This is the only code billable for the implant device. An outpatient hospital or ASC must adhere to the following billing instructions to receive reimbursement for the implant device in addition to the outpatient ASC rate. No additional reimbursement i s available for the implant device if performed in an inpatient setting. Table 8.183 provides billing instructions for these services. Billing Instructions for the Hysteroscopic Sterilization Procedure with Implant Device Provider Claim Type Bill for t he Procedure and the Supply Additional Billing Requirements Outpatient Hospital or ASC UB-04 58565 with appropriate revenue code Print the name of the implant device in the body of the claim form or on the accompanying invoice Submit a valid, signed Sterilization Consent Form with the claim Enter ICD Z30 .2 - Encounter for Sterilization as the primary diagnosis on the claim CMS -1500 bill for the device under the professional or durable medical equipment (DME) provider number Bill the device using A 4264 - Include a cost invoice with the claim to support the actual cost of the device Physician CMS -1500 58565 Bill the device on a separate line using A 4264 - Include a cost invoice Providers must adhere to the following procedures: Submit the manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) with the claim to support the cost of the device. The IHCP reimburses 75% of the amount listed on the manufacturer's cost invoice up to a statewide maximum of $1,700. Submit a valid, signed Sterilization Consent Form with the claim. Ensure the primary diagnosis on the claim is ICD code Z30 .2 - Encounter for S terilization . Print \"Sterilization Implant Device\" on the claim form or on the accompanying invoice. Informed Consent Providers must allow at least 30 days, but not more than 180 days, to pass between the date when the member gives the informed consent, and the date when the provider performs the sterilization procedure. The patient must give the informed consent at least 30 days before the expected date of delivery or confinement. The Indiana Health Coverage Programs (IHCP) defines premature delivery as l abor before 37 weeks' gestation. The following exceptions apply to premature delivery or emergency abdominal surgery: The member must sign the informed consent for the sterilization for family planning 72 hours before the sterilization when done at the ti me of a premature delivery. The physician must indicate the reason for the surgery being performed early and the individual's expected date of delivery. The reason for the surgery must be only because of premature delivery or emergency abdominal surgery. The person who obtains informed consent must verbally communicate all information about a sterilization procedure to the member to be sterilized, including a member who is blind, deaf or otherwise handicapped. Providers must furnish an interpreter if a la nguage barrier exists. For a full description of the informed -consent process, 42 CFR 441.257 provides additional information. Providers cannot obtain informed consent while the member to be sterilized is in one of the following situations: In labor or c hildbirth Seeking or obtaining an abortion Under the influence of alcohol or other substances that affect the member's state of awareness Retroactive Eligibility or Failure to Provide Proof of Eligibility If the provider does not obtain the required St ate sterilization consent form before the procedure because of a retroactive eligibility situation or because the patient failed to inform the provider of IHCP eligibility, the IHCP does not cover the service. Anthem or Medicaid cannot pay for sterilizatio ns performed if the member did not sign the consent form before the procedure. The provider cannot bill the member for the procedure if there was no consent signed prior to the procedure. To prevent this situation and to ensure IHCP coverage, providers may use the State consent form for sterilization notification for all Medicaid patients in their practice. Other nonsterilization procedures may be separately billable. If unrelated services are provided at the same time as sterilization for an Anthem membe r, the provider can be reimbursed for medically necessary services unrelated to the sterilization when the sterilization is noncovered due to consent not being obtained. Medically necessary services are subject to the IHCP's established policy on retroacti ve services as outlined in the Member Eligibility and Benefit s Modules in the IHCP Provider Reference Modules . Consent Forms A properly completed Consent for Sterilization form, online at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services at https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2020 -07/cons ent-for-sterilization -english - updated.pdf , must accompany all claims for voluntary sterilization. When providers properly complete the Consent for Sterilization form (HHS -687), Anthem receives all the necessary information regarding consent , interpreter's statement , statement of person obtaining consent and physician's statement . A Spanish version of the form is also available online at https://opa .hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2020 - 07/consent -for-sterilization -spanish -updated.pdf . Documentation Requirements A completed consent form must accompany all claims for sterilization and related services. This requirement extends to all providers: attending physicians and surgeons, assistant surgeons, anesthesiologists, inpatient and outpatient hospital facilities, or other providers of related services. Providers must attach a photocopy of the consent form for sterilization and related s ervices to each claim form or send it separately as an attachment to the electronic claim transaction. Anthem must receive a properly completed consent form before making payment. To ensure timely payment to related service providers, the primary service provider should forward exact copies of the properly completed consent form to the related service providers. Hysterectomy Billing The IHCP provides coverage for a medically necessary hysterectomy performed to treat an illness or injury. The IHCP does no t cover a hysterectomy performed solely to render a member permanently incapable of bearing children, whether performed as a primary or secondary procedure. Informed Consent and Acknowledgement Statement The IHCP covers hysterectomy only when medically necessary, and only when the member has given informed consent. The provider must have informed the member orally and in writing that the procedure will render the member permanently incapable of reproducing , and the member must have signed a written acknowledgement of receipt of that information. The member or member's representative must sign an informed consent or acknowledgement except when the patient is already sterile, or a life -threatening emergency exists for which the physician determines prior acknowledgement is not possible. However, the physician who performs the hysterectomy under these circumstances must complete the following requirements: Certify in writing the individual was already steril e at the time the hysterectomy was performed. State the cause of the sterility at the time of the hysterectomy. Certify in writing that the hysterectomy was performed under a life -threatening emergency in which the physician determined that prior acknowl edgement was not possible. The physician must also include a description of the nature of the emergency. Claims billed with the procedure codes for hysterectomy shown in the following table require a document that includes the information necessary to sat isfy documentation and certification requirements for hysterectomies. Providers cannot use the sterilization consent form for hysterectomy procedures under any circumstances. Please use the Acknowledgement of Receipt of Hysterectomy Form with the claims. Procedure Codes - Hysterectomy Services Refer to Obstetrical and Gynecological Services in the IHCP Provider References attach the appropriate documentation to the paper claim form or send it separately as an attachment to the electronic claim transaction. All providers of hysterectomy -related services must attach a photocopy of the appropriate acknowledgement or physician certification to the claim. The primary service provider should forward copies of the acknowledgement or physician certification statement to the related service providers to ensure timely payment. Retroactive Eligibility Retroactive eligibility rules parallel those noted above according to 42 CFR 441.255 . The IHCP pays for hysterectomies performed during an individual's retroactive eligibility if the phy sician who performed the hysterectomy certifies the following in writing: The physician informed the individual before the operation that the hysterectomy would make her permanently incapable of reproducing. The individual was already sterile before the hysterectomy. The individual required a hysterectomy because of a life -threatening emergency. The physician determined that prior acknowledgement was not possible, and the physician who performed the hysterect omy did one of the following: o Certified in writing that the individual was already sterile at the time of the hysterectomy, and stated the cause of the sterility. o Certified in writing that the hysterectomy was performed under a life -threatening emergency situation and prior acknowledgement was not possible. o Included a description of the nature of the emergency. Providers must check eligibility for the date of service to determine Medicaid coverage in the event of retroactive member eligibility.

Section 2 : Institutional Claims Billing for hospitals and other health care facilities and services can require special attention because major services have their own set of billing requirements. This section is broken down into health service categories to help you find the specific bi lling codes you'll need for each one. You will also find information on the proper method for filling out and specific coding guidelines for the standard hospital and health care facilities claim form, the CMS -1450 . Basic Billing Guide lines In general, here are the basic billing guidelines you'll need for institutional claims submitted to Anthem: Use HCPCS, CPT or Revenue Codes: Valid HCPCS, CPT or revenue codes are required for all line items billed, whether sent on paper or electronic ally. Split Year -End Claims: Services that begin before or in December and extend beyond December 31st should be billed as a split claim at calendar year end. This is typically due to a member changing plans with an effective date of January 1. Two UB-04 forms , either electronic or paper, must be used and must be submitted together. Split Dates of Service for a Provider Contract Change: When a provider contract change occurs during the course of treatment, reimbursement will default to the contract t hat is active at discharge. Itemize Services: Service itemization is required when the \"From\" and \"Through\" service dates are the same. Provide Medical Records: Medical records for certain procedures may be requested for determination of medical necessity . Use Modifiers: Use modifiers in accordance with your specific billing instructions. Use Codes for Unlisted Procedures: Some provider services or procedures are not found in CPT; therefore, specific code numbers for reporting unlisted procedures have been designated. When an unlisted procedure code is used, will need a description of the service in order to calculate the appropriate reimbursement. Medical records may be requested. Do Not Use CPT Code 99070: This code, for supplies and materials provided ov er and above those usually included with an office visit or other services, is not accepted by Anthem. Health care Providers must use HCPCS Level II Codes , which give a detailed description of the service provided. Anthem will pay for surgical trays only f or specific surgical procedures. Surgical trays billed with all other services will be considered incidental and will not be paid separately. System edits are in place for both electronic and paper claims. Claims submitted improperly cannot be easily proce ssed and could be denied. National Drug Codes See National Drug Codes on page 5. Emergency Room Visits The billing requirements for an emergency room visit apply to the initial treatment of a medical or psychiatric emergency, but only if the patient does not remain overnight. If the emergency room visit results in an admission, then all services provided in the emergency room must be billed in conformity with the guidelines and requirements for inpatient acute care. Reimbursement for emergency room servic es relates to the nature of the emergency diagnosis and can be based on urgent care rates, depending on the diagnosis. The billing requirements for emergency room treatment cover all diagnostic and therapeutic services, including, but not limited to: Equipment Facility use (including nursing care) Laboratory Pharmaceuticals Radiology Supplies Other services incidental to the emergency room visit Anthem will not reimburse providers for services rendered in an emer gency room for treatment of conditions that do not meet the prudent layperson standard as an emergency medical condition. There are three exceptions to this requirement: Anthem will reimburse the physician screening fee and facility fee, even if the condit ion is not an emergency Anthem will reimburse if the services were authorized by Anthem or if the primary medical physician referred the member for treatment Anthem will reimburse if the member called the 24/7 NurseLine and was advised to go to the emergen cy room Anthem will review Hoosier Healthwise, Healthy Indiana Plan and Hoosier Care Connect emergency services claims to determine appropriate use of the emergency room and whether an emergency medical condition existed. At a minimum, both the facility an d the physician will receive reimbursement for screening services: For physician services billed on a CMS -1500 claim: If a prudent layperson review determines that the service was not an emergency, Anthem is required to reimburse, at minimum, for CPT code 99281, the Emergency Department Visit Level 1 screening fee. For facility charges billed on a UB-04: If a prudent layperson review determines the service was not an emergency, we must reimburse for revenue code 451, EMTALA Emergency Medical Screening Servi ces. Special emergency room billing instructions and requirements: Specific coding is required for emergency room billing. Use the following guidelines, including: Bill each service date as a separate line item. Members should receive screening examination regardless of payment of copay No ER copay is necessary if the patient is admitted; the ER copay only applies to nonemergent services provided in an ER setting Use CPT codes 99284 or 99285 for emergency room billing. Use ICD principal diagnosis codes, as required, for all services provided in an emergency room setting. Use revenue codes 0450 -0452, and 0459, as required. Unless clinically required, follow -up care should never occur in the emergency department. Members should be referred back to their primary medical provider and correct billing should follow standard, nonemergency guidelines. Urgent Care Visits The billin g requirements for urgent care visits apply to all urgent care cases treated and discharged from the hospital outpatient department or emergency room. Urgent Care: Nonscheduled, nonemergency hospital services required to prevent serious deterioration of a patient's health as a result of a n unforeseen illness or injury. Urgent care billing should detail all diagnostic and therapeutic services including, but not limited to: Equipment Facility use (including nursing care) Laboratory Pharma ceuticals Radiology Supplies Other services incidental to the visit Urgent care visits do not apply to those cases that are admitted and treated for inpatient care following urgent care treatment. Special urgent care billing instruc tions: Specific coding is required for urgent care billing. Use the following guidelines, including: Bill each service date as a separate line item. Use current ICD -10 principal diagnosis codes, as required, for all services provided in an urgent care sett ing or designated facility. Use the required CPT codes: 99281 -83. 072X. Use billing code 99050 for after -hours care. If the member is admitted following urgent care, then the entire billing requiremen t shifts to acute or sub-acute care. Maternity The billing requirements for maternity care apply to all live and stillbirth deliveries. They include payment for services including, but not limited to: AINPEC -2753 -20 Marc h 2021 Room and board for mother (including nursing care) Nursery for baby (including nursing care) Delivery room/Surgical suites Equipment Laboratory Pharmaceuticals Radiology Other services incidental to admission The maternity care rate covers the entire admission , except for admissions approved for extension beyond the contracted time limit for continuous inpatient days. In such cases, the billing requirements for the entire admission shifts to those for inpatient acute care (later in this section) for each approved and medically necessary service day. Therapeutic abortions, treatment for ectopic and molar pregnancies and similar conditions are excluded from payment under this rate. For deliveries with dates of admission on or after July 1, 2014, one of the following condition codes must be included on the UB-04 claim form (when applicable), and when billing with CPT codes 59409, 81: Ce sarean sections or inductions performed at less than 39 weeks, zero days of gestation for medical necessity; o Claims with condition code 81 and one of the diagnosis codes on the Medical Necessity Code List will pay (you may find this list at www.anthem.com/inmedicaiddoc > Prior Authorization & Claims > Forms and other resources ). o Claims with condition code 81 but without one of the codes from the Medical Necessity Code List require medical records demonstra ting medical necessity for delivery are submitted with the claim. Submitted medical records will be reviewed prior to payment to determine if the delivery was medically necessary and the claim will pay/deny accordingly. In the case of denial, the right to appeal is retained. o Claims with condition code 81 but without one of the diagnosis codes from the Medical Necessity Code List , and no records submitted with the claim, will deny. The right to appeal is retained. Medical records may be submitted at the time of appeal request. 82: Cesarean sections or inductions performed at less than 39 weeks, zero days of gestation; use this condition code for deliveries prior to 39 weeks, zero days of gestation that do not meet the IHCP's stated guidelines for medically ne cessary deliveries (the exception is natural or spontaneous delivery prior to 39 weeks ). (Refer to Obstetrical and Gynecological Services in the IHCP Provide r References Modules for approved indications.) These claims will automatically deny. The right to appeal is retained. 83: Cesarean sections or inductions performed at 39 weeks, zero days of gestation or later; these claims will automatically pay . Note: An institutional claim for a delivery that was the result of spontaneous labor, regardless of route of delivery, should be submitted without a condition code. Institutional claims submitted without a condition code because the delivery was the result of spon taneous labor will automatically pay. Inpatient Acute Care The billing requirements for inpatient acute care apply to each approved and medically necessary service day in a licensed bed. They include, but are not limited to: Room and board (including nursing care) Emergency room (if connected to admission) Urgent care (if connected to admission) Equipment Laboratory Pharmaceuticals Radiology Supplies Surgery and recovery suites Other services incidental to the admission Prior authorization is required for all admissions except standard vaginal delivery and Cesarean sections. Special billing instructions and requirements: Must be an Indiana Health Coverage Programs (IHCP) facility Utilization Manageme nt approval is required for all admissions, except routine deliveries Billing observation room or outpatient charges with an inpatient stay: o The dates reported on the CMS 1450 form in the \"From\" box of Form Locator 6 (FL 6) and Form Locator 17 (FL 17) should be the same . These charges should also reflect the date the patient was admitted as an inpatient to the hospital. o Using the \"From\" box of (FL 6) and (FL 17) to reflect the date of an observation stay or outpatient charges that may have occurred pr ior to inpatient admission is incorrect and may cause processing delays. Hospital Assessment Fee FSSA implemented a Hospital Assessment Fee (HAF) in accordance with Public Law 229 -2011, SECTION 281 as enacted by the 2011 Session of the Indiana General Ass embly. The fee is used in part to increase reimbursement to eligible hospitals for services provided in fee -for-service and managed care programs, and as the State's share of disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments. The HAF increases inpatient and outpatient reimbursement for eligible hospitals so that aggregate payments reasonably approximate the Medicare upper -payment limits without exceeding those limits. The increases in reimbursement will be based on adjusting fa ctors that will be applied to the inpatient diagnosis -related group (DRG), inpatient level -of-care (LOC) per -diem rates and outpatient rates. Hospital Stays of Less Than 24 Hours When submitting claims for hospital stays of less than 24 hours, bill the cl aim as an Outpatient Hospital Services claim and follow these guidelines: Service Codes: Include the correct CPT/HCPCS codes for each service Line Items: Bill each service for each date as separate line items Revenue Codes: Bill the revenue codes with the appropriate CPT/HCPCS codes Type of Bill: Type of bill field entry must be 13X Claims denied for a stay of less than 24 hours are claims that have the same admit and discharge date, or have a discharge date of the day after admission. Patients who are tran sferred out within 24 hours of admission should be billed as outpatient claims. This does not apply to neonatal claims, which are expressly one -day stays that fall under the following diagnosis -related groups (DRGs): DRG 637 - Neonate, died within 1 day of birth, born here DRG 638 - Neonate, died within 1 day of birth, not born here DRG 639 - Neonate, transferred less than 5 days old, born here DRG 640 - Neonate, transferred less than 5 days old, not born here Inpatient claims with next day discharge are as sumed to be less than 24 hours if medical records are not provided. Claims submitted for inpatient stays with the \"through date\" of service one day later than the \"from date\" of service will be subject to post payment review. Inpatient Sub -Acute Care The b illing requirements for inpatient sub -acute care include each approved and medically necessary service day in a licensed and accredited facility at the appropriate level of care. Sub-Acute Care: Includes levels of inpatient care less intensive than those required in an inpatient acute care setting. Each inpatient sub -acute care admission is considered a separate admission from any preceding or subsequent acute care admission, and should be billed separately. Covered services include, but are not limited t o: Room and board (including nursing care) Equipment Laboratory Pharmaceuticals Radiology Supplies Other services incidental to the admission All sub -acute admissions require prior autho rization and a treatment plan. The treatment plan must accompany the admission and include: Functional, reasonable, objective and measurable goals within a predictable time frame for each skilled discipline A discharge plan and options that are individuall y customized and identified from the admission date, and that are carried forward from the admission date Weekly summaries for each discipline, and bi -weekly conference reports Outpatient Laboratory, Radiology and Diagnostic Services There are specific billing requirements for outpatient laboratory, pathology, radiology and other diagnostic tests.

Provide medical records when Anthem needs to review and determine the correct grouping for services not defined in the surgery grouping. Use billing field entry 13X. Use the appropriate CPT/HCPCS code. Use the CPT/HCPCS code, as mandated by the HIPAA, for outpatient surgery billing. Outpatient Th erapies Outpatient therapy services include physical, occupational, speech and respiratory therapies. An outpatient therapy visit means a single service date. Billing requirements for these visits include, but are not limited to: Facility use (including nursing care) Therapist/professional services Equipment Pharmaceuticals Supplies Other services incidental to the outpatient therapy visit Special outpatient therapies billing instructions: There are specific requirements for billing outpatient therapies, including: Bill each service date as a separate line item.

When using an unlisted CPT/HCPCS code, provide the name of the drug or medication in Box 43 of the CMS -1450 claim form Hospital -Acquired Conditions/Present on Admission Indicators The IHCP utilizes a hospital -acquired conditions (HA C) policy for Medicaid claims using its existing version 30 of the All Patient Diagnosis -Related Group (AP DRG) grouper. Hospitals are required to report whether each diagnosis on a Medicaid claim was present on admission. Claims submitted without the requ ired POA indicators are denied. For claims containing secondary diagnoses that are included in the list of HACs in Table 8.13 and for which the condition was not present on admission, the HAC secondary diagnosis is not used for APR DRG grouping. That is, t he claim is paid as though any secondary diagnoses included in the table below were not present on the claim. HAC Categories and Corresponding CC or MCC Codes For procedure codes, visit https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare -Fee-for-Service - Payment/HospitalAcqCond/icd10_hacs . Diagnosis Codes Foreign Object Retained After Surgery HAC 1 Air Embolism HAC 2 Blood Incompatibility HAC 3 Pressure Ulcer Stages III & IV HAC 4 Falls and Trauma: Fracture Dislocation Intracranial Injury Crushing Injury HAC 5 Diagnosis Codes Burn Other Injuries Catheter -Associated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) HAC 6 Vascular Catheter -Associated Infection HAC 7 Surgical Site Infection, Mediastinitis, Following Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) HAC 8 Manifestations of Poor Glycemic Control HAC 9 Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Following Certain Orthopedic Procedures HAC 10 Surgical Site Infection Following Bariatric Surgery for Obesity HAC 11 Surgical Site Infection Following Certain Orthopedic Procedures HAC 12 Surgical Site I nfection Following Cardiac Electronic (CIED) HAC 13 Iatrogenic Pneumothorax with Venous Catheterization HAC 14 Present on Admission Indicator POA is defined as a condition \"present\" at the time the order for inpatient admission occurs. Conditions that develop during an outpatient encounter, including emergency department, observation or outpatient surgery are considered POA. A POA indicator must be assigned to principal and secondary diagnoses (as defined in Section II of the Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting ). CMS does not require a POA indicator for an external cause of injury code unless it is being reported as an \"other diagnosis.\" Therefore, the IHCP does not require a POA indicator in the External Cause of Injury field locator 72. If a POA indicator is entered in the External Cause of Injury field, it is ignored and not used for APR DRG grouping. An exemption for HAC/POA is Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE) diagnoses following a total knee replacement or hip replacement for pediatric and obstetric patients. When all these conditions are present on the claim, the HAC/POA requirement is bypassed and none of the diagnosis codes included on the claim is suppressed. Hospital -Acquired Condition List The IHCP updated the list of hospital -acquired conditions (HACs) to comply with the federally defined list. The IHCP follows CMS' HAC determinations, including any future additions or changes to the current list of HAC conditions, as well as diagnosis codes that are exempt from HAC reporting. The list of exempt diagnosis codes can be found in the Hospital -Acquired Conditions page at https://www.CMS.gov . Provider Preventable Conditions CMS issued Change Request (CR) 6405 to instruct hospitals how to bill for erroneous surgeries. The IHC P adopted the CMS rule and does not cover surgical or other invasive procedures to treat particular medical conditions when the practitioner performs the surgery or invasive procedure erroneously, including: Incorrect surgical or other invasive procedures Surgical or other invasive procedures on the wrong body part Surgical or other invasive procedures on the wrong patient The IHCP also does not cover hospitalizations and other services related to these non -covered procedures. All services provided in the operating room when an error occurs are considered related and therefore not covered. All providers in the operating room when the error occurs, that could bill individually for their services, are not eligible for payment. All related services provided during the same hospitalization in which the error occurred are not covered. The IHCP will deny payments to providers for inpatient, inpatient crossover, inpatient crossover Medicare Replacement Plan, outpatient, outpatient crossover, outpatient crossover Medicare Replacement Plan, physician, physician crossover, and physician crossover Medicare Replacement Plan claims when provider preventable conditions (PPC) are performed on a patient.

Without such review, claims for DME will be denied. Prior to dispensing, please contact Anthem's Utilization Management (UM) department. Please note: The presence of a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code does not necessarily mean that the benefit is covered or that payment will be made. Some DME codes may be By Report (customized) and therefore require a dditional information for pre -service review and processing. Special Guidelines for Durable Medical Equipment Billing Durable medical equipment billing requires a differentiation between rentals and purchased equipment. It also requires specific codes and modifiers. Use the appropriate modifier to identify rentals versus purchases (new or used). Claims submitted without the right modifier will be reimbursed at the rental rate. Use HCPCS codes for DME or supplies. Use an unlisted or miscellaneous code (suc h as E1399) when an HCPCS code doesn't exist for a particular item of equipment. Use valid codes for DME and supplies; unlisted codes will not be accepted if valid HCPCS codes exist. Attach the manufacturer's invoice to the claim if using a miscellaneous or unlisted code. The invoice must be from the manufacturer, not the office making the purchase. Catalog pages are not acceptable as a manufacturer's invoice. DME Rentals Most DME is dispensed on a rental basis. These rentals require medical documentation from the prescribing provider. Rented items remain the property of the DME provider until the purchase price is reached. Charges for rentals exceeding the reasonable charge for a purchase are not accepted, and rental extensions may be o btaine d only on approved items. DME providers should use normal equipment collection guidelines. Anthem is not responsible for equipment not returned by members. DME Purchase DME may be reimbursed on a rent -to-own basis over a period of 10 months, unless otherw ise specified at the time of review by our Uti lization Management department. DME Wheelchairs/Wheeled Mobility Aids At Anthem, we follow Medicaid guidelines for calculating By Report (customized) wheelchair claims.
