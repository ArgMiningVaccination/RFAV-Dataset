POLICIES ON PHASE III CLERKSHIPS Any first attempt \"Fail\" grade in a Phase III course must be successfully remediated prior to initiating another Phase III course. For more information, please refer to the \"Policy on Student Promotion and Awarding the MD Degree\" in its en -promotion Committee on Student Promotions and Evaluation (CSPE) may require students to take and pa ss specifically designated Phase III Clerkships to remediate deficiencies in knowledge, skills, or behavior important to the practice of medicine. Study away from UNM SOM is considered a privilege and may be denied by CSPE if the committee deems such acti vities are not in the best interest of the student's education. To receive credit for a Phase III educational experience at another medical facility, students must follow the procedures outlined in this handbook. Failure to do so will result in \"N o Credit \" received. A student who has had academic difficulty may be prohibited from taking Phase III clerkships away from the UNM SOM campus. Students are not permitted to receive monetary compensation for courses taken to meet graduation requirements. Special circumstances permit exceptions for clerkships taken outside the Albuquerque area. In some cases, research electives or other rotations may be approved by CSPE for credit as well as monetary compensation. Any exception must be approved by the Office of Und ergraduate Medical Education and CSPE prior to taking the course. PHASE III SCHEDULING PHASE II CLERKSHIP RESCHEDULING Most Phase III clerkships have prerequisite s stating that all or specific Phase II C lerkships must be completed. Students who were approved to postpone or \"float \" one or more clerkships during Phase II will be scheduled for those Phase II courses prior to starting Phase III clerkships unless approved by the Clerkship Director(s). Students will be scheduled based on availability after the incoming Phase II students have been scheduled and in consultation with the Clerkship Director s and CSPE. The Office of Medical Student Affairs will notify students of Phase II assignments. Students requesting to take these rotations in blocks other than 1 and 2 must complete the Phase III Scheduling Exception Form, provided by OMSA. PHASE III SCHEDULING Students submit preferences for their Phase III schedules using the Phase III Scheduling Request Worksheet. Upon obtaining Match Advisor consultation and approval signatures from the Associate or Assistant Dean of Students, the form is then submitted to OMSA. Students can requests all courses except those that require specific departmental approval prior to course registration. These courses are identifie d in this catalog and require that a signed course change request (add/drop) form be submitted to OMSA after the initial auto -generated schedules are assigned to all students. Students should keep the following in mind when requesting courses: Phase II p rerequisites stated in the Clerkship Catalog must be met Dates for early and regular Match application and interviewing schedules CLNS 605: Comprehensive Ambulatory Care is offered ONLY during certain blocks \"Concurrent\" scheduling is NOT permitted. Studen ts may only be registered for and complete one course per block, regardless of the schedule/time commitments of the course. The Phase II Class Rankings that appear in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (also known as the Dean's Letter ) are based o n a census date that will fall in mid- July. Only Phase II grades that have been received by that date will be calculated into the rankings. This includes any re -takes of failed shelf exams. 6 The University of New Mexico School of Medicine 2019 -2020 Phase III Clerkship Catalog The UNM School of Medicine reserves the right to make changes to any of the policies, procedures, codes, standards, requireme nts, or services incl uded in this handbook as it deems necessary, with changes applicable to all students in attendance at the SOM Doctor of Medicine program.

PHASE III NON -CATALOG EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES Students are not restricted to the courses listed in this catalog and are encouraged to initiate educational experiences here at UNM or at other institutions. Visiting Student Learning Opportunities : The AAMC VSLO application service (commonly referred to as VSAS) enables medical students to pursue learning opportunities in locations away from their home institutions. VSLO/VSAS is used by LCME accredited medical schools as a way to receive, review, approve, and schedule away rotations. The Office of Medical Student Affairs grants access to students and helps facilitate the application process using this system. OMSA will consider away rotations scheduled in VSAS as \"pre -approved\" for credit when they meet the following criteria: It is at an LCME -accredited institution It is 4 -weeks in length The student is using it for \"Elective\" credit only It is NOT an international rotation If the rotatio n does not meet the criteria above - ex: the rotation is for less than 4 weeks or you wish to have the away rotation satisfy a Sub- Internship or ICU requirement, you must follow the instructions listed under the appropriate section below (Non -VSAS Away Rot ations, Credit for Sub- I and ICU, International Clerkships) in order to receive credit. Please note: All VSLO/VSAS rotations must be added to a student's schedule using the VSAS Add/Drop form BEFORE the rotation begins. NON -VSAS AWAY ROTATIONS All non -catalog away rotations (electives that do not use VSLO/VSAS for application processing) must have the prior approval of CSPE. Requests must be submitted to OMSA at least 45 days in advance of the start of the rotation. To request approval for a non -catalog e xperience, the student must: Complete Section I and II of the Phase III Credit Request form (available from OMSA) Obtain a written description of the course, either from a course catalog or affiliated website If applicable, complete a Sub- I/ICU Credit Request form (available from OMSA) to accompany the Phase III Credit Request Form Present the Phase III Credit Request Form, course description, and (if applicable) the Sub- I/ICU Credit Request Form to the appropriate UNM SOM Department Clerkship Director/Ch air for review and approval signature. UNM departments must approve and sign these forms to ensure that the away rotation satisfies our basic course requirements for each specialty Submit the request with departmental signature and all other documents to t he Office of Medical Student Affairs at least 45 days prior to the start of the rotation. The request is reviewed by OMSA, UME, and is forwarded to CSPE for final consideration and approval. Any student who takes a non -catalog course without the required prior approval of CSPE will not receive credit for the course, regardless of the grade given by the course instructor. Please also keep in mind that UNM SOM does not provide malpractice insurance coverage for a non-catalog course that has not been pre -appr oved by CSPE. Following CSPE's review, the student is notified via email of CSPE's decision regarding the request. The student is also responsible for providing the faculty evaluator at the host institution with the appropriate evaluation form to receive the grade or credit. Credit for a course will not be given until a completed UNM SOM evaluation form with a passing grade is received in the Office of Medical Student Affairs. In the event of a cancelled or dropped rotation, students are responsible f or meeting the requirements set forth by the host institution (ex: cancellation deadlines, fees, etc.) Students must also ensure that the course is removed from the UNM SOM schedule by contacting OMSA. 11 The University of New Mexico School of Medicine 2019 -2020 Phase III Clerkship Catalog The UNM School of Medicine reserves the right to make changes to any of the policies, procedures, codes, standards, requireme nts, or services incl uded in this handbook as it deems necessary, with changes applicable to all students in attendance at the SOM Doctor of Medicine program.

DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY Anatomic Pathology at UNMH Goals and Unique Aspects: The Medical Student Anatomic Pathology Rotation exposes student s to the two core disciplines of UNMH Anatomic Pathology: surgical pathology and cytopathology. Time spent on this rotation will be evenly distributed between these two specialties. In Surgical Pathology, training will begin in the UNMH Gross Room, where students will participate in the triage/dissection of surgical specimens, as well as observe real -time, intraoperative consultations (including frozen sections). Students will then experience the continuity of seeing these specimens via glass slides the nex t day, where they will join Pathology residents in \"preview\" sessions, formulating preliminary diagnoses prior to the final case sign -out with Pathology attending at the multi -head teaching microscope. In Cytopathology, students will follow a similar preview/sign -out cycle of cytology cases with residents/attendings. In addition, students will accompany our residents and attendings while we perform our own fine needle aspiration biopsies on patients, including a subset of cases in which we perform ultrasoun d-guided biopsies. Finally, students will attend any scheduled multi - disciplinary tumor boards and Pathology resident didactic sessions. By the end of their four weeks, students will have obtained a thorough understanding of the vital diagnostic and consu ltative role that anatomic pathologists play in our hospital system. Objectives: 1) Identify common indications for intraoperative frozen section evaluation of surgical specimens. 2) Recognize the role of the surgical pathologist in triaging surgical specimens for ancillary studies such as cytogenetics, flow cytometry, and microbial cultures. 3) Perform gross dissections of simple surgical specimens (e.g., appendices, gallbladders) with direct faculty supervision. 4) Develop differential diagnoses for surgical pathology and cytopathology cases during slide preview sessions. 5) Defin e the cytologic features of low -grade and high -grade dysplasia, as seen in the routine Pap test. 6) Explain the core cytologic features that are suggestive of malignancy. 7) Perform a successful ultrasound -guided fine needle aspiration biopsy using the Phantom training device. 8) Indicate potential sites for a primary malignancy, based on the pattern of cytokeratin 7 and 20 expression of a metastatic tumor focus. Respon sibilities: Prior to days spent in the UNMH Gross room, students will be expected to review patient histories for upcoming surgeries. Gross room time will be spent observing dissections and processing simple specimens under direct supervision. During surg ical pathology/cytopathology glass slide preview, students will be expected to preview a small subset of cases and, using histologic features and the electronic medical record, generate preliminary diagnoses and/or differential diagnoses for their cases. D uring case sign -out with the attending, students will be expected to discuss their findings and convey their diagnostic impression and reasoning. Students on the cytopathology service will also be expected to accompany Pathology resident didactic sessions.

DEPARTMENT OF UNDERGRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION Creating Medical Educators for the Future Goals and Unique Aspects: This is a course that teaches 4th year medical students how to teach. The course is designed to help 4th year medical students (course may include residents) develop the skills needed to be more effective educators, learners, and clinicians as they transition to a teaching rol e in residency and eventually as clinical faculty. All students are welcome, even if they choose not to pursue a career in academics. This course will teach students how to teach colleagues, learners, employees/staff, and patients. This course offers opportunities and develops skillsets that are not available to faculty in many circumstances. Through extensive reading, interactive sessions, and teaching practice, students will be introduced to methods of teaching in large- group, small - group, and one - on-one scenarios. This includes practice teaching one another, junior and senior medical students, resident physicians, and standardized patients. Additionally, as part of this course students will become certified in the Stanford Clinical Teaching Method which can be added to their CV for residency interviews. By the end of the rotation, students will be competent in their understanding of evidence- based methods of learning, optimal teaching, and how to design curricula for academic and non -academic settings. St udent participants in this course will have ample opportunity to practice teaching in the Phase I Clinical Reasoning Course, Doctoring, Pediatric Morning Report, Internal Medicine Afternoon Report, and during a UNM freshman course in healthcare. Objectiv es: By the end of the course, learners should be able to: Outline at least 4 principles of learning theory Describe how principles of learning theory apply to teacher- student and physician- patient interactions List at least 4 components of effective eviden ce-based teaching Describe 3 techniques for effective information sharing with colleagues and patients Demonstrate at least 2 specific teaching strategies to effectively facilitate learning in clinical situations, large and small -group learning sessions Demonstrate at least 3 best practices of public speaking Outline the basic structure of a medical curriculum Recognize the importance of medical students and residents as teachers Increase satisfaction and decrease anxiety about teaching Responsibilities: Participants are responsible for the readings (Make it Stick), teaching one another, preparing and teaching in Pediatric and Internal Medicine case conference, and teaching college freshman on UNM main campus.

Supervision of par ticipating learners will occur both in the classroom and in small -group teaching sessions where feedback will be provided by faculty and one another. Learners will practice teaching skills as co - facilitators in small -group sessions for phase I or II medic al students or with peers in class. Course faculty will supervise students during these activities or alternatively recruit additional faculty as small group session co -facilitators. Student/resident teaching will be observed during delivery of one or more large -group didactic sessions, after which faculty and class participants will provide feedback. Evaluation: Final grade is pass/fail. A passing grade is contingent on participation in all the following unless otherwise excused by coordinator: 1) Attendanc e of at least 75% of didactic sessions, 2) Participation in all assigned teaching sessions, 3) Delivery of a final didactic or other teaching sessions utilizing teaching methods learned in the course, 4) Completion of all online coursework with a passing grade. Additional Information: The development and structure of the course is based on Dr. David Kern's book Curriculum Development in Medical Education and the AAMC logic model in program evaluation provided by the AAMC's Te4Q seminar.
