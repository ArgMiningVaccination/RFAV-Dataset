(Mexican Last updated on Jul 24, 2023. Clinical Overview Use Various smilax extracts have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, as well as effects on cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome; however, evidence is based largely on animal and in vitro studies, and clinical trials are limited. Sarsaparilla has been traditionally used for treating syphilis, leprosy, and psoriasis; however, clinical evidence to support these uses is lacking. Evidence is also lacking for purported ergogenic/adaptogenic effects. Due to limited clinical study data, use of sarsaparilla cannot be recommended for any indication. Dosing Clinical trials are lacking to provide guidance on therapeutic dosages. Contraindications Contraindications have not been identified. Pregnancy/Lactation Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities have been described for extracts of at least one of the species. Interactions None well documented. Adverse Reactions Clinical studies are lacking. GI irritation and increased diuresis have been reported. Occupational asthma caused by sarsaparilla root dust has been reported. Toxicology No data. Scientific Family - Liliaceae (lily) - Smilacaceae (catbrier) Botany Many Smilax species are very similar in appearance, regardless of origin. Sarsaparilla is a woody, trailing vine that can grow to 50 m in length. The nectar-rich flowers are used in honey production, and the root is used for medicinal purposes. The root has a pleasant fragrance and spicy sweet taste and is used as a natural flavoring agent in medicines, foods, and nonalcoholic beverages; however, the sarsaparilla root should not be confused with the sassafras tree, the source of the distinctive flavoring beer.
