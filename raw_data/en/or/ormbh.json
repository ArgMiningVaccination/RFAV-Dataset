The prevalence of dementia was reported to be 10.2% in the Republic of Korea, of which approximately 74.5% were diagnosed with AD [ [2](#b2-jyms-2021-01683)]. Both reports showed that the incidence of AD increases with age and that the prevalence of AD is expected to increase until 2050. The cause of AD is not completely understood [ [3](#b3-jyms-2021-01683)], and its pathophysiology is associated with amyloid-beta (A) and tau protein accumulation, glial dysfunction, neurodegeneration (loss of neuronal connections), and activity [1](#b1-jyms-2021-01683), [4](#b4-jyms-2021-01683)- [6](#b6-jyms-2021-01683)]. [7](#b7-jyms-2021-01683)]. Glenner and Wong [ [8](#b8-jyms-2021-01683)] first suggested a correlation between cerebrovascular A protein and Down syndrome (trisomy 21), which is homologous to AD. In dominantly inherited AD, missense mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin-1/-2 genes on chromosome 21 increase A production. Nondominant AD increases A levels in the brain via the failure of A clearance. Both of these situations result in the accumulation of A42 oligomers in limbic systems. Affluent diffuse A plaques without neuritic dystrophy, microgliosis, astrocytosis, and tangle formation have been observed in people who died in their early to mid-teens because of familial AD [ [9](#b9-jyms-2021-01683)]. A42 oligomers, which have been isolated from late-onset AD brains, reduce synapse density, suppress prolonged potentiation, and reinforce prolonged synaptic depression in the rodent hippocampus [ [9](#b9-jyms-2021-01683)], and intraventricular injection of A42 oligomers in healthy mature rats [ [10](#b10-jyms-2021-01683)]. [9](#b9-jyms-2021-01683)]. A42 oligomers in patients with AD could also induce tau phosphorylation, which is associated with an increase in neurofibrillary tangles and neurotoxicity [ [9](#b9-jyms-2021-01683), [11](#b11-jyms-2021-01683)]. Since the discovery of A protein, the A hypothesis [ [12](#b12-jyms-2021-01683), [13](#b13-jyms-2021-01683)] has become the dominant model of AD pathogenesis and is guiding the development of potential therapeutic strategies. Although it is unclear how A accumulates in the central nervous system and subsequently initiates AD, the generation of A may occur in the neuronal axonal membranes after [ [14](#b14-jyms-2021-01683), forming senile plaques outside neurons [ [16](#b16-jyms-2021-01683), [17](#b17-jyms-2021-01683)]. [18](#b18-jyms-2021-01683)], including inhibitors against -secretase or -secretase, selective A42-lowering agents, and immunotherapy against A. The results of a few clinical trials with monoclonal antibodies to A have suggested a significant cognitive decline in patients with mild, but not moderate AD [ [9](#b9-jyms-2021-01683)], but most immunotherapies eventually failed in phase II (crenezumab and gantenerumab) or phase III (solanezumab, aducanumab, and bapineuzumab) clinical trials [ [19](#b19-jyms-2021-01683)]. These failures of A monoclonal antibodies imply the need for a new approach to treat patients with AD. [20](#b20-jyms-2021-01683), [21](#b21-jyms-2021-01683)] that underlies the disrupted calcium ion homeostasis and apoptosis seen in AD [ [22](#b22-jyms-2021-01683)]. Optogenetics is a neuromodulation method that uses a combination of genetic methods and optical instruments to allow light to modulate the specific molecular and cellular activities of individual neurons in living tissue [ [23](#b23-jyms-2021-01683)- [26](#b26-jyms-2021-01683)]. In this review, we will discuss the historical applications of optogenetics to investigate the mechanisms and possible therapeutic strategies involved in AD based on the A hypothesis. Optogenetic technique as a new neuromodulatory method [27](#b27-jyms-2021-01683)] speculated the concept of using light to control neuronal activity in 1979, Callaway and Katz [ [28](#b28-jyms-2021-01683)] used light to uncage glutamine in living brain slices. Zemelman et al. [ [29](#b29-jyms-2021-01683)] developed a targeting method using light to control rhodopsin-sensitized neurons. Nagel et al. [ [30](#b30-jyms-2021-01683)] first applied the optogenetic manipulation of cation-selective ion movement by expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in Xenopus laevis and mammalian cells. Boyden et al. [23](#b23-jyms-2021-01683)] activity [ [33](#b33-jyms-2021-01683), [34](#b34-jyms-2021-01683)]. [35](#b35-jyms-2021-01683), [36](#b36-jyms-2021-01683)]. Transgenic mice, including those using the Thy1 promoter, express opsins in the affected region at higher specificity than viral vectors do [ [36](#b36-jyms-2021-01683), [37](#b37-jyms-2021-01683)]. Using the Cre/lox recombinase system to create transgenic mice is a novel approach to optogenetics [ [36](#b36-jyms-2021-01683)]. Photo-activable Cre recombinase can stably modify gene expression in the mouse brain [ [38](#b38-jyms-2021-01683), [39](#b39-jyms-2021-01683)]. [40](#b40-jyms-2021-01683)]. Eventually, optogenetic techniques allow localized modulation of cell types of interest and simultaneous bidirectional control [ [41](#b41-jyms-2021-01683)]. Moreover, the amplitude of stimulation and the time course are easily controlled by the light. This stimulation was shown to be relatively reproducible [ [42](#b42-jyms-2021-01683)]. Gamma oscillation entrainment and Alzheimer disease [6](#b6-jyms-2021-01683)]. Jasper and Andrews [ [43](#b43-jyms-2021-01683)] first introduced the term \"gamma wave\" in their report on the \"normal differentiation of occipital and precentral regions in man\" to describe higher frequencies (35-48 Hz) beyond the beta range. The widely reported frequency of gamma oscillations is 25 to 140 Hz, with the 40-Hz frequency being of particular interest [ [44](#b44-jyms-2021-01683)]. In addition to light, sound, or tactile stimuli [ [44](#b44-jyms-2021-01683)], various methods to stimulate gamma waves, including temporal interference [ [45](#b45-jyms-2021-01683)], ultrasound stimulations [ [46](#b46-jyms-2021-01683)], and optogenetics [ [47](#b47-jyms-2021-01683)] have been suggested. Gamma oscillations correlate with various functions of the brain, including sensory processing and cognitive functions such as learning and memory [ [48](#b48-jyms-2021-01683)]. Inter-areal coherence and local regulation have generated interest in gamma oscillations [ [49](#b49-jyms-2021-01683), [50](#b50-jyms-2021-01683)]. Parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons are dominant in gamma oscillation generation [ [6](#b6-jyms-2021-01683), [51](#b51-jyms-2021-01683)], while the activation of pyramidal neurons increases lower frequency oscillations in vivo [ [49](#b49-jyms-2021-01683)]. [52](#b52-jyms-2021-01683)- [54](#b54-jyms-2021-01683)] or enhanced gamma band power and lagged gamma responses [ [55](#b55-jyms-2021-01683), [56](#b56-jyms-2021-01683)] have been observed in patients with AD. Disturbances of slow gamma oscillations have also been reported in rodent AD models [ [57](#b57-jyms-2021-01683)]. Interestingly, the transgenic APP-presenilin-1 mouse model of AD exhibits decreased gamma oscillation power in the lateral entorhinal cortex, which transmits various sensory inputs to the hippocampus and thus participates in memory processes analogous to those affected by human AD [ [58](#b58-jyms-2021-01683)]. Decreased hippocampal slow gamma oscillation power has also been observed in a transgenic mouse model of AD [ [57](#b57-jyms-2021-01683)]. [59](#b59-jyms-2021-01683)]. Light and sound stimulation between 8 and 15 Hz in patients with AD who are elderly improves cognitive performance, memory function, and alpha waves [ [44](#b44-jyms-2021-01683), [60](#b60-jyms-2021-01683)]. Visual stimulation by light flashes increases gamma band activity, in which patients with AD demonstrate increased frontoparietal gamma coherence and reduced occipitoparietal coherence [ [44](#b44-jyms-2021-01683), [56](#b56-jyms-2021-01683)]. [61](#b61-jyms-2021-01683)]. A close association between reduced gamma activity and functional behavioral deficits, as well as altered hippocampal gamma oscillations connected to A, was found in the olfactory network of APPswe transgenic mice [ [62](#b62-jyms-2021-01683)]. Optogenetic neuromodulation and Alzheimer disease began. [64](#b64-jyms-2021-01683)- is released synaptically by optogenetic stimulation [ [68](#b68-jyms-2021-01683)]. Bell et al. [ [68](#b68-jyms-2021-01683)] suggested that activation of 42 receptors mediates nicotinic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) lacunosum-moleculare using retroviral AAV expressing oChIEF in a Cre-dependent manner. Optogenetic activation of pyramidal neurons in the entorhinal cortex layer III improves synaptic defects between pyramidal neurons and CA1 parvalbumin-positive neurons in transgenic AD mice. It also halts the decrease in spatial learning and memory [ [69](#b69-jyms-2021-01683)]. Although AAV has been generally used as a viral vector, the incidence of sharp wave ripples is reduced by optogenetic stimulation at the target location. The medial septum cholinergic stimulation of sleeping animals decreases sharp-wave ripples and advances theta-gamma oscillations. This research highlights the significance of the timing of cholinergic input. This could explain the limited success of cholinesterase inhibitor drugs in AD [ [70](#b70-jyms-2021-01683)]. [71](#b71-jyms-2021-01683)]. Optogenetic stimulation of hippocampal memory engram cells in transgenic AD mice overexpressing APP/presenilin-1 induces memory retrieval. Optogenetic stimulation of DG engram cells improved long-term memory and spine density [ [72](#b72-jyms-2021-01683)]. Optogenetic stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2-enhanced yellow improved memory impairment. Stimulation of DG neural ensembles leads to enhancement of memory retrieval and reactivation of neural ensembles [ [73](#b73-jyms-2021-01683)], which suggests that optogenetic DG manipulation could be a target for AD treatment. [10](#b10-jyms-2021-01683)]. As antagonism of adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) mimics memory impairment prevention in AD animal models [ [74](#b74-jyms-2021-01683)- [77](#b77-jyms-2021-01683)], optogenetic monophosphate cAMP levels and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. This activation induces memory dysfunction in the hippocampus through phospho-CREB signaling [ [77](#b77-jyms-2021-01683)]. These reports suggest that multiple, targeted optogenetic approaches can be used to treat AD [ [10](#b10-jyms-2021-01683)]. Optogenetics-induced gamma oscillations and Alzheimer disease [49](#b49-jyms-2021-01683)], optogenetics-induced gamma oscillations may have therapeutic potential for AD. Studies on the applications of optogenetics to 40-Hz gamma oscillations have been ongoing since the optogenetic stimulation of fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive interneurons in gamma oscillations was first demonstrated in mice [ [78](#b78-jyms-2021-01683)]. Entrainment or synchronization of hippocampal gamma oscillations and spiking to 40 Hz via noninvasive stimuli, such as flashing lights or pulses of sound [ [79](#b79-jyms-2021-01683)], reduces the A load and activates microglia in a well-established 5XFAD mouse model of AD [ [80](#b80-jyms-2021-01683)]. [80](#b80-jyms-2021-01683)]. Co-localization of microglia and A was confirmed by histological analysis and induction of genes related to morphologic transformation of microglia was confirmed by gene expression profiling. That study suggested a neuroprotective role of gamma oscillations that affect neurons and microglia. Gamma oscillations also decrease phosphorylated tau protein levels [ [80](#b80-jyms-2021-01683)]. [47](#b47-jyms-2021-01683)]. Accumulation of A1-42 oligomers disrupts long-term potential and oscillations and activates autophagy. Photostimulated APP/presenilin-1 mice showed a significant decrease in escape latency in the Morris water maze test, indicating that optogenetic stimulation ameliorates spatial learning [ [ [82](#b82-jyms-2021-01683)]. This activation selectively increases spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents at theta and gamma frequencies and restores A-induced reductions [ [83](#b83-jyms-2021-01683)]. [84](#b84-jyms-2021-01683)]. Optogenetic stimulation of double-frequency slow waves increased the disruption of calcium homeostasis by A and induced synaptic spine loss [ [85](#b85-jyms-2021-01683)]. Subsequent human clinical trials of gamma oscillation band stimulation have shown mild cognitive improvements in patients with AD who have been exposed to light, sound, or tactile stimuli in the 40-Hz range [ [44](#b44-jyms-2021-01683)]. However, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms by which gamma oscillation band stimulation ameliorates AD pathology are unknown. Limitations and prospects of optogenetics [86](#b86-jyms-2021-01683)]. Although optogenetic technology for AD could be a new therapeutic approach, the major limitation of optogenetics is the use of viral vectors to express microbial opsins in human cells. Using viral vectors for gene therapy is considered a risky method that has not been fully tested to date, since AAV may cause activation of innate immunity and systemic inflammatory responses in humans [ [87](#b87-jyms-2021-01683), [88](#b88-jyms-2021-01683)]. Current optogenetics is mostly invasive because of the implantation of optic fibers, and overheating that induces tissue damage may be caused by the light [ [89](#b89-jyms-2021-01683)]. Optogenetic stimulation also increases neuronal DNA double-strand breaks in mice [ [90](#b90-jyms-2021-01683)]. The inappropriate use of optogenetics may paradoxically induce AD. Five months of chronic optogenetic stimulation could increase the formation of A [ [91](#b91-jyms-2021-01683)] and the release of tau protein [ [92](#b92-jyms-2021-01683)]. Moreover, it remains a challenge to target opsins to defined organelles, including the plasma membrane or mitochondria [ [93](#b93-jyms-2021-01683), [94](#b94-jyms-2021-01683)] or to specific regions including dendrites or axon terminals [ [94](#b94-jyms-2021-01683)]. [93](#b93-jyms-2021-01683), [95](#b95-jyms-2021-01683)], autism, schizophrenia, abuse, anxiety, and depression [ [34](#b34-jyms-2021-01683), [49](#b49-jyms-2021-01683), [78](#b78-jyms-2021-01683), [96](#b96-jyms-2021-01683)]. As shown in the historical timeline ( [Fig. 2](#f2-jyms-2021-01683)), this technology could modulate specific targets and neuronal activity [ [97](#b97-jyms-2021-01683)]. The technical development of light delivery sources is also required. MicroLED arrays selectively stimulate opsins and act as biological amplifiers [ [98](#b98-jyms-2021-01683)]. For in vivo modulation, the wireless form of a light source improves the application of optogenetics. Wireless control of light sources has been studied since 2011 [ [99](#b99-jyms-2021-01683)]. In vivo injectable instruments require safe injectable battery technologies. The battery-free wireless system developed by Zhang et al. [ [100](#b100-jyms-2021-01683)] could be another solution. "}
