Wave power could supply 10% of global electricity by 2050 but harnessing the power of the ocean to produce affordable energy is the toughest engineering challenge in renewable energy. Increasing expertise in the Welsh academic sector is producing more efficient photovoltaic materials and thermoelectric devices. Hydrogen as an energy source and the generation of the gas from wind, solar and bacteria represents another step forward. 1855 1856 1857 David Hughes from Bala invents the type-printing telegraph used throughout the USA. Dowlais ironworks become the first to take out a licence to make Bessemer steel.John Dillwyn Llewelyn and his daughter Thereza take some of the earliest lunar photographs from their Penllergaer observatory.17Milford Haven is one of the few natural harbours in Europe capable of accommodating super-tankers to supply the refinery industry and the receiving terminal for imported LNG (liquefied natural gas), as the cleanest of the fossil fuels. A number of valleys in Wales have been dammed for water storage and supply whilst others provide hydroelectric power. Wave power was first used in the sixth century at a tidal mill for grinding corn adjoining the Carew castle in Pembrokeshire. Marine Power Systems launched their WaveSub 1:4 scale prototype at Pembroke Docks in 2017 to capture energy using the continual orbital motion of waves. Gwynt y M\u00f4r 750MW wind farm is among the largest commercial offshore windfarms worldwide.

Lord Walter Marshall of Rhymney succeeded Brian Flowers as director of the Atomic Energy Research centre at Harwell and was later chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board. The precursor of the fuel cell, the gas battery, was developed by William Grove of Swansea. The Centre for Alternative Technology in Machynlleth has a world-wide reputation and provided expertise and working examples in the field of energy generation and usage for over thirty years. Milford Haven's import and regasification of LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) was one of the largest hydrocarbon projects of its kind. It involved the construction of a 300km pipeline to Gloucestershire that was the UK's largest high-pressure gas pipeline delivering 20% of the natural gas required by the UK.

It burns waste wood that would otherwise end up in landfill. Clarence Arthur Seyler, working in Swansea, devised the original classification of coal ranks. Welsh scientists made a major contribution to atomic energy research, including the bomb programme. Ieuan Maddock, an electronic instrumentation specialist, led important work in the field of seismology making a significant contribution to the Partial Test Ban Agreement between Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union in 1963. This banned nuclear testing in the atmosphere. The Mond Nickel Company in Clydach, near Swansea, developed part of the process for the first atomic bomb, the only place in the world that could produce the nickel for the membranes. 1878 The use of phosphatic iron ores for iron and then steel making was invented by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas and Percy Carlisle Gilchrist at Blaenafon.1879 Lord Nelson Hotel Ballroom at Milford Haven is first in Britain to be electrically lit. 20The Active Classroom, designed by Swansea University's SPECIFIC centre, can generate, store and release its own energy using Tata Steel's special sheet steel cladding to generate electricity. 21Dr Joan Elizabeth Curran of Swansea developed the idea which came to be known as 'Operation Window' - the scattering of 'metallic confetti' or chaff in the path of enemy aircraft to disrupt their radar. She also worked on the electromagnetic isotope separation process for the atomic bomb. Myfanwy Prichard-Roberts of Caernarfon, worked at Rhydymwyn, and was one of ten women and seventy men who worked there testing nuclear equipment prototypes.

They are developing specialised fire and shut off dampers as part of the containment structure over the encased nuclear reactor. 23BUILDING WALES The Built Environment Superimpose centuries of human activity on a country bounded on three sides by the sea, on a topography laden with mountains, and river valleys and you have testing conditions for crossings of all sorts - from roads to railways and canals. Crossing rivers and estuaries has preoccupied engineers in Wales for centuries and some of the major innovations in design and the use of materials have been designed or built here. From the early use of stone and cast-iron to the fine lines of cable stayed structures, Wales has been at the forefront of bridge construction. With an abundance of natural building stone, the man-made landscape in Wales has great variety. The use of dressed local stone has given many terraced-house communities in the mining valleys a unique character and the abundance of high-quality slate extracted 1896 1897 1897 The Snowdon Mountain Railway opens, the highest railway, and the only rack railway system, in Britain.Weavers Building, Swansea, was Europe's first multi- storeyed reinforced concrete building.Gugliemo Marconi makes first over-water transmission of radio waves, over the Bristol Channel, supported by Welsh engineer William Preece.25from the north-west quarries graces not only local buildings but also many world-wide.

Metal production and finishing has traditionally ranged from large castings and forged items, the rolling of rails for the railways, tinplate and other specialised coatings and alloys to structural steelwork and steel for the automotive industry. The trend is now towards the manufacture of smaller and more complex items and components with, ultimately, the arrival of technology suitable for manufacturing machines on a nano-scale. The development of micro and nano- technology devices continues apace and new materials, control systems and finite element techniques are much in evidence with engineered items, for the biomedical, electronics and environmental sectors are being made to very high tolerances. 29One of the largest maritime civil engineering projects in Europe was the Cardiff Bay Barrage built to create a permanent fresh water lagoon and flood relief provision. 301915 1921 Charlotte Nicholas of Cardiff, patented a minesweeping apparatus and what she called 'disintegrators' - a idea for a 'tank' before their first appearance on the western front.Britain's first major oil refinery opens at Llandarcy.Rapid prototyping is revolutionising product design, and here industry is supported by a unique university partnership, the Advanced Sustainable Manufacturing Technologies (ASTUTE) The Welding Institute (TWI) technology Centre provides wide ranging support including non- destructive testing (NDT) at its R&D facility at Port Talbot.
