We believe in scientific rigor, innovation and passion as driving force. BioNTech was founded by scientists and physicians to translate science into survival by combining fundamental research and operational excellence. Therapeutic Areas We at BioNTech believe that the immune system is the fundamental driver for therapeutic success in cancer, and infectious diseases and other serious diseases. As immune engineers we have a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms that enable the immune system to effectively recognize both external threats like infectious diseases and internal threats like cancer. Our goal is to translate this expertise into therapies and vaccines that can make a difference for individuals as well as humankind. Oncology Cancer is a devastating disease and remains a tremendous burden worldwide. As every cancer type is unique, we believe that immunology and immunotherapy should be able to address each cancer indication in a different way. Therefore, we have established a range of technology platforms and tools with the aim to develop the optimal treatment options for each tumor indication. Infectious Diseases We believe the technology behind our COVID-19 vaccine has potential against a range of other infectious diseases. Our COVID-19 vaccine efforts have demonstrated several advantages over the traditional vaccine development that we aim to translate into new mRNA vaccine programs targeting diseases with a massive health burden such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. Drug Classes Our goal is clear: we want to provide better medicines for patients worldwide. Our toolbox includes a broad range of drug classes and platform technologies including mRNA-based therapies, cell therapies, small molecules as well as antibodies and other protein-based therapies. They can be utilized for specific purposes and have the potential to be combined with each other or with approved therapies in a synergistic manner. With this diversified approach, we aim to provide the optimal treatment for each patient. Clinical Trials We strive to exploit the full potential of the body's immune system by combining powerful new therapeutic mechanisms and a diverse array of biological targets to successfully help address cancer, infectious diseases and other serious diseases. As part of this mission, we are conducting clinical trials to translate science into survival. Pipeline We have built a unique pipeline of investigational immunotherapies and vaccines based on multiple drug classes with the aim to achieve medical breakthroughs in oncology and infectious diseases.
