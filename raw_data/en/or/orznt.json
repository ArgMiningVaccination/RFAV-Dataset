How are acupuncture and chiropractic care similar? 26 Answers [Catherine Rahm Coudray](/Expert/1532839-Catherine-Rahm-Coudray)Acupuncturist Laramie, Wy Not similar. Acupuncture non invasive. Chiropractor invasive moves bones tendons. [Ms. Ellen D. Leonard](/Expert/1434534-Ellen-D-Leonard)Acupuncturist Grants Pass, OR They aren't. One deals with the physical body - bones and nerves, the other with the energies of the body. Entirely different approaches. Both viable and helpful, but very different. [Diana D. Choe](/Expert/81820704-Diana-D-Choe)Acupuncturist Warren, NJ Acupuncture and chiropractic are not same. We have very different theories and understanding about the body and how to treat it. The combination of having both chiropractic and acupuncture is great however the treatments are very different. [Mr. Anthony James Lorenzo](/Expert/2819877-Anthony-James-Lorenzo)Acupuncturist Neither uses toxic medications/pharmaceuticals or surgery, though both might refer you to a surgeon if necessary. [Natalie Ramsey](/Expert/3662693-Natalie-Elizabeth-Ramsey)Acupuncturist Montclair, New Jersey Well they are actually very different in technique of course, but they both work to improve the blood and energy flow. [Elizabeth Perry](/Expert/82735435-Elizabeth-Perry)Acupuncturist Palm Beach Gardens, FL Chiropractic is a small piece of ASIAN Medicine [Covyn Montemayor](/Expert/81226975-Covyn-Montemayor)Acupuncturist Orlando, FL Hello, As an acupuncture physician, I have worked with patients receiving both acupuncture and chiropractic care. The two therapies work well in conjunction with each other. Chiropractic care works with the musculoskeletal system releasing subluxations causing further health impacts. Acupuncture works through a series of biological functions to release neurotransmitters into the system that relax muscles, increase blood circulation, and regulate hormones.

Chiropractic care and Acupuncture are very different and both wonderful modalities. Acupuncture utilizes fine sterile needles placed in specific points of the body to help regulate the bodies ability to maintain optimal health, such as reduce stress, relieve pain, regulate hormones, minimize or resolve chronic headaches, relieve arthritis pain, etc. Chiropractic care uses gentle manipulations along the spine to maintain optimal health and wellness. Wishing you a lifetime of joy and perfect health. Wishing you a lifetime of joy and perfect health. [Ramona Whan](/Expert/271147-Ramona-Whan)Acupuncturist Wildomar, CA Well, they are only similar in that they are both natural. Otherwise, I'm not sure they are similar at all. Chiropractic is based on the belief that all illness comes from subluxations in the spine. Acupuncture is based Traditional Chinese Medicine and the belief that illness is caused when Qi and Blood are not flowing freely or properly (through the meridians of the body). Also, their healing mechanisms are completely different except that they both may practice some form of gua sha on their patients. [WenShuo Wu](/Expert/81226382-WenShuo-Wu)Acupuncturist Diamond Bar, CA Chiropractor adjust your skeletal system (bones and joints) for your problem. Mainly for musculoskeletal system problems. Acupuncture insert needles to regulate your body to release certain neurotransmitters (i.e, endorphins) for your pain (headache, arthritis, fibromyalagia, dysmenorrhea....) or physiological problems (insomnia, anxiety, poor digestion, menopause, PMS...).

[ryan bishop](/Expert/81226544-ryan-bishop)Acupuncturist loxahatchee, fl They are similar because of the hands-on approach however acupuncture has a tendency to correct imbalance and to allow the body to reset itself naturally whereas Chiropractor is more of a forced method [Yan Jin](/Expert/81226324-Yan-Jin)Acupuncturist Boston, MA I think chiropractic care focus on spine problems by hand skills, and acupuncture treatment of mine understanding should pay attention to whole body's balance, and stimulating by acupuncture needs. [Adam Perna](/Expert/81226479-Adam-Perna)Acupuncturist Roseland, NJ No [Rachel Lopez](/Expert/1675371-Rachel-Lopez)Acupuncturist Rochelle Park, NJ Acupuncture and chiropractic are similar in that they are natural approaches to wellness. Both practitioners work on balancing the body to allow for natural healing. Actually, both work very well together to ensure patients are receiving a well-rounded treatment. [Cris Angel](/Expert/3005825-Cris-Angel)Acupuncturist Retired, Retired They are not similar. Very different methods and schooling as medical acupuncture is one medical procedure of 22 medical procedures at part of Eastern Medicine in WA State as an example. [Mrs. Angela Kay Buckridge](/Expert/143996-Angela-Kay-Buckridge)Acupuncturist Seymour, TN Chiropractic comes from acupuncture. They both simulate the body for it to heal naturally. Yours in Health, Angie Yours in Health, Angie [Diana Abramachayeva](/Expert/902165-Diana-Abramchayeva)Acupuncturist Queens, NY They are not similar at all. [Mozart Paiva](/Expert/82735205-Mozart-Paiva)Acupuncturist Baltimore-Nottingham, MD Chiropractic is a wonderful treatment, and so is acupuncture. It is my opinion that they complement each other. [Jinhua Qian](/Expert/82220209-Jinhua-Qian)Acupuncturist Windsor Mill, MD Both of them can work on muscles like pain, soreness, tightness etc. But Chiropractic also works on bones when acupunctue not. [Ms. Qin Milla Mu](/Expert/2479613-Qin-Milla-Mu)Acupuncturist San Jose, CA They are different. Acupuncture uses needles to insert into the skin, chiropractic uses hands. I do not know about chiropractic, but I think they treat spine and other diseases caused by spine problems. Acupuncture can treat spine problems and other diseases. [Daisy Dong](/Expert/1916920-Daisy-Dong)Acupuncturist Denver, CO Not at all. [Phranque Wright](/Expert/81225847-Phranque-Wright)Acupuncturist Chicago, IL They're not similar at all unless your Chiropractor is a trained acupuncturist. Acupuncture follows Chinese medical model and Chiropractic follows a Western medical model. Very different. [Poyuan (Kevin) Hou](/Expert/81726967-Poyuan-Kevin-Hou)Acupuncturist Pomona, CA They are not the same. Chiropractic treatment is from the Tuina in Chinese Medicine. Acupuncture is the way to communicate with your brain to care for your health. [Andrea Cillo](/Expert/81226399-Andrea-Cillo)Acupuncturist Bay Shore, New York They are not. Though some chiropractors may use acupuncture or acupressure in their treatments, chiropractic care alone focuses on physical alignment to alleviate conditions. Acupuncture treats at both the physical and energetic levels. Our theories are very different as well. [Long Vi Vuong](/Expert/82456011-Long-Vi-Vuong)Acupuncturist San Diego, CA Hello! They are similar in terms of not using medications to relived pain. [Jeff Rippey](/Expert/81225813-Jeff-Rippey)Acupuncturist Saint Joseph, MO In my opinion, there aren't many similarities. Chiropractors are looking at the body through the lens of the spine and the spinal nerve roots. They're adjusting the spinal motion segments in order to relieve pressure on the nerve roots to address some issue. Usually it's back pain, but the spinal nerve roots go on to provide ennervation to all body structures so, theoretically, there are a wide variety of issues that could potentially be addressed (assuming an impinged nerve was the root cause). Usually, chiropractors are well trained in nutrition too and their entire scope of practice varies from state to state. Those of us who practice Chinese medicine, on the other hand, are using a completely different lens through which we view the body and disease/dysfunction. Like chiropractors, and many other providers of more \"natural\" treatment, we're using holism as our base - in other words we look at the human body as an interconnected whole. We depart somewhat from other providers because we also consider the human as being embedded in their environment, so there are environmental influences/factors which we also consider. In general, the Chinese diagnostic model is very different from both the conventional system and the systems in use by other holistic/natural medicine providers. It would take a great deal more space to fully explain this. Chinese diagnostics are not simple, there aren't any short explanations and to get the most out of Chinese herbs and acupuncture, there's a certain level of skill one must develop (which generally takes more than just a few weekends). Basically, chiropractic and Chinese medicine are two completely different skill sets which take time (years usually) and concentrated effort to develop. The theoretical under-pinnings of both systems are completely different and the Chinese system has the added twist of coming from a completely different cultural context that had a completely different view of science and nature. In particular, the Chinese diagnostic model and the Chinese view of the etiology and pathogenesis of disease requires one to step outside of the usual western material-reductionistic paradigm.
