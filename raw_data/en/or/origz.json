Here's a look at what these terms mean, their potential benefits, and how to find the right practitioner for you. Alternative and Complementary vs. Integrative Health Approaches The terms \"alternative,\" \"complementary,\" and \"integrative health\" are often conflated, but they have different meanings. \"Alternative therapies are used to describe health and medical treatments that rely on the body's innate healing power,\" says [Tabatha Parker, ND](https://nunm.edu/faculty/dr-tabatha-parker/#:~:text=Moira%20Fitzpatrick.-,Dr.,wife%20and%20mother%20of%20two.), the director of education at the [Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine](https://www.aihm.org/) in La Jolla, California. \"Such therapies, which are rooted in global [healing ](https://www.who.int/health-topics/traditional-complementary-and-integrative-medicine) [traditions](https://www.who.int/health-topics/traditional-complementary-and-integrative-medicine), are designed to promote health, prevent illness, and raise awareness of disease conditions without the use of conventional medications and interventions.\" Though there are many therapies that fit into this category when used in isolation from conventional medicine, a few examples are [acupuncture](/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/) with a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, traditionally and culturally used herbs and supplements, and energy practices like [reiki](https://www.everydayhealth.com/reiki/). Previously, the common terminology was \"complementary and alternative medicine,\" and the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/statistics-from-the-national-health-interview-survey) and other academic groups have shifted toward the use of \"integrative\" and \"complementary health\" approaches and therapies instead. Are Alternative and Complementary Approaches Safe? That said, there is a difference in safety depending on what therapy you're using, says [Susan Gaylord, PhD](https://www.med.unc.edu/phyrehab/directory/susan-gaylord/), a research associate professor and the director of the [Program on Integrative Medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine](https://www.med.unc.edu/phyrehab/pmr-program-on-integrative-medicine/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20Program,(CAM)%20with%20mainstream%20healthcare.) in Chapel Hill. For instance, it's unlikely you can harm yourself by practicing mindfulness, but other approaches, such as taking supplements or herbs, could be harmful if not done under the guidance of a licensed practitioner. Some, like trying a [detox](/diet-and-nutrition/diet/detox-cleanses-most-popular-types-what-know/) or cleanse, can be dangerous. \"To be safe, it's best if you can coordinate your care with a doctor who is trained in conventional medicine techniques and is also very knowledgeable about other therapies, or works with someone who is,\" Dr. Gaylord says. It's important to have a primary care provider or internal medicine doctor who can aid in diagnosis and watch for things like side effects and medication interactions. Remember that \"natural\" doesn't always equal safe or free of harm, which is why it's so important to see someone who carries the required certifications or licenses in your state. Complementary and Alternative Therapies by Type Types - Nutritional Herbs and supplements, therapeutic diets, prebiotics, and [probiotics](/probiotics/guide/) - Psychological Meditation, hypnosis and [guided imagery](/integrative-health/guided-imagery/guide/), and relaxation therapies, such as breathing exercises - Physical Acupuncture, massage, chiropractic, reflexology, and Pilates - Combinations Also known as mind-body therapies, such as yoga, tai chi, qi gong, dance, music and [art therapy](/integrative-health/art-therapy/guide/), mindful eating, and mindfulness-based stress reduction There are also alternative medicine or healing systems, such as traditional Chinese medicine, [Ayurvedic medicine](/integrative-health/ayurveda/guide/), homeopathy, and naturopathic medicine, which are \"systems and beliefs that evolved over time in different cultures and parts of the world,\" notes the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam). These approaches use various therapies that can fall under and are used in both conventional and complementary and alternative ways. Potential Benefits [Mary Guerrera, MD](https://facultydirectory.uchc.edu/profile?profileId=Guerrera-Mary), a professor and the director of integrative medicine in the [department of family medicine at the University Connecticut School of Medicine](https://health.uconn.edu/family-medicine/)in Mansfield. Some of this is due to funding, she says. Other reasons, according to research, include a lack of well-qualified complementary and alternative medicine researchers, negative bias about this type of research, and reluctance from those in the complementary and alternative space to conduct mainstream research. However, that doesn't mean they're not effective. Each therapy has its own set of potential benefits versus risks, like every conventional therapy and medicine. For example, according to Parker, \"meditation or acupuncture can help patients better manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life by reducing fatigue, pain, and anxiety.\" By using therapies that \"support the body's healing,\" she says, people may have fewer side effects. If you're interested in complementary and alternative health approaches, speak with your primary care physician about your goals for treatment or general well-being, and the therapies that you'd like to incorporate into your care. They can talk to you about the benefits (or help you research these) or refer you to someone who can (like a [board-certified integrative medicine practitioner](https://www.abpsus.org/specializations/integrative-medicine/)). Safety To ensure the safety of whatever therapy you choose to pursue, make sure to consult your primary care physician first. Then find certified and licensed practitioners in the treatment you choose. Integrative Health You may find that an integrative approach tailored to your health needs and challenges can help you stay well and help treat existing conditions. \"Integrative health brings together conventional and complementary medicine. It's the best of both worlds,\" says Dr. Guerrera. Philosophy The word to remember with integrative health approaches is \"inclusive,\" says Guerrera. Traditionally, we may have thought about medicine as only the practice of seeing your doctor. However, an integrative approach brings together doctors, nurses, pharmacists, as well as complementary and alternative medicine practitioners in their various specialties to collaborate on the approaches to health and healing that might be right for an individual patient, she says. Potential Benefits [insomnia](/insomnia/guide/), among others, may benefit most from an integrative medicine approach. Finding a CAM or Integrative Health Practitioner Thanks to a growing interest in CAM and integrative health, led first by [The Bravewell Collaborative](https://bravewell.org/bravewell_publications/) in the early 2000s, more hospitals have opened up integrative or complementary medicine centers. That's great news for you: \"This means the hospital has done the work of vetting the credentials of the practitioners who are there,\" says Guerrera. Another option is asking your primary care provider for a referral, though they may not be able to confidently recommend someone if it's an area in which they have limited knowledge or experience. Sometimes, your health insurance may cover some of these providers and services, so be sure to check. Outside of a hospital setting, many practitioners have independent practices, and there are also integrative medicine clinics. This will require investigation on your part, as the term \"integrative\" is often used loosely and not necessarily referring to the type of evidence-informed integrative healthcare philosophies referred to in this article. You can find those clinics in your area with an internet search, but you'll also want to look into their credentials on your own. The NCCIH recommends inquiring about practioners' education, training, licensing, and certifications. When inquiring about an initial appointment, ask if they are willing to work with your primary care provider in coordinating your care, suggests Guerrera. Parker notes that a good resource is the Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine's [Find a Provider tool](https://aihm.org/members/find-a-provider/). The University of Arizona's Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine also has a [directory](https://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/alumni.html) to find trained [integrative healthcare practitioners](https://www.everydayhealth.com/integrative-health/things-to-know-when-selecting-an-integrative-healthcare-provider/) who have gone through its programs, as well as [another directory](https://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/coaching_directory.html) to find a certified integrative health or wellness coach. Tips for Consulting Your Conventional Doctor About Complementary Therapies \"Having a dialogue with your doctor about this is key,\" says Guerrera. \"Research shows that patients want their doctor to talk to them about this, but it's not easy to move this movement of holistic, integrative, whole-person care into mainstream medicine.\" All that is to say: You may have to bring it up on your own. Guerrera suggests opening the conversation with something like \"I'm curious: What do you think about XYZ treatment?\" Or \"I'm interested in XYZ because of this reason. What can you tell me about it or do you know anyone who practices it?\" Resources We Love on CAM and Integrative Health Favorite Orgs for Essential Integrative Health Info [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/atoz) Interested in learning more about chiropractic care, [evening primrose](/drugs/evening-primrose) oil, massage, omega 3 fatty acids, and a whole lot more?
