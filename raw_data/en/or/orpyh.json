Homeopathy treats each person as a unique individual with the aim of stimulating their own healing ability. A basic belief behind homeopathy is \"like cures like.\" A homeopath selects the most appropriate medicine based on the individual's specific symptoms and personal level of health. It is recognized by the World Health Organization as the second largest therapeutic system in use in the world. While it is most popular in India and South America, over thirty million people in Europe, and millions of others around the world, also benefit from its use. How Does It Work? A basic belief behind homeopathy is \"like cures like.\" In other words, something that brings on symptoms in a healthy person can -- in a very small dose -- treat an illness with similar symptoms. This is meant to trigger the body's natural defenses. For example, red onion makes your eyes water. That's why it's used in homeopathic remedies for allergies. "}
