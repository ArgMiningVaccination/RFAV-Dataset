Venugopala Reddy* There are substantial disparities across the southern Indian and northern (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) states in terms of fundamental economic phenomena, such as per capita net state domesticproduct, rural and urban poverty rates, and investment flows, with thesouthern states taking a lead over their northern counterparts. In thispaper, we make an attempt to understand what factors have caused somestates to grow faster than others. We examine human capabilities, skills and awareness, resources and the efficiency of their utilization, extent of urbanization, good governance including law and order, and infrastructureacross the two group of states. We conclude that the upward shift in percapita income, downward trend in poverty reduction and investment flowsthat occurred in the south relative to that in the northern states can beexplained partly by the advantage the former had in terms of human capabilities, infrastructure, urbanization and some law and order conditions and partly by the economic liberalization of 1991.

INTRODUCTION It is now well known that, in India, there is substantial variation in income across states. For instance, the per capita net state domestic product (NSDP) of thesouthern state of Tamil Nadu was Rs 14,000 (in 1993-94 prices) in 2004-05, whereas the NSDP of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh was only Rs 6,138 for the same year (in 1993-94 prices), less than half that of Tamil Nadu (based on data from theEconomic and Political Weekly Research Foundation (EPWRF)). Similarly, accordingto data from the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Industry,Government of India, Maharashtra, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu togetheraccounted for nearly 32 per cent of all foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into the country, and Delhi, parts of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana accounted for 18 per cent, whereas Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal accounted for less than 0.02 per cent of allFDI inflows into the country. In fact, Dreze and Sen (1997) point out that some of thesouthern Indian states have been growing at the rate of countries in East Asia, suchas Singapore, whereas some states in the north have been crawling at the rates ofthose in sub-Saharan Africa causing an eventual fault line to develop between the states. While the state has policymaking power, throughout this paper we compare the four southern Indian states (Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu defensible as regions can beviewed as common markets which consist of several states and which facilitate themovement of ideas, goods and services. A comparison of this kind between the northern and southern states mentioned above is defensible because Punjab, Haryana and the western states of Gujarat and Maharashtra have been high on the economic performance scale ever since independence. For instance, as early as 1960-61, the per capita incomes ofPunjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra were respectively Rs 4,923, Rs 4,614,Rs 4,904 and Rs 5,527, compared with only Rs 3,338 for Uttar Pradesh (all in1993-94 constant prices). 1 The southern states surged sometime in the recent past, in the 1980s or 1990s (this is something we will discover in the forthcoming analysis). 1One could argue that Rajasthan has moved out of this league of poor-performing states recently (as pointed out by Ahluwalia, 2000). Rajasthan has been in this league of slow growing states historically,and its growth is only a recent phenomenon. So we retain Rajasthan in our set of northern states, ourobjective being to study longer run trends. One could also make a case for including Orissa, which hasalso lagged economically, in the list of northern states. Orissa, being in the east, does not enter thenorth-south debate that is the focus of our work here. In the section on research objectives and literaturesurvey, we clearly lay out the scope of our paper.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 3With the exception of Rajasthan, which has been only recently surging (see Ahluwalia, 2000), the northern states have remained behind. As Paul and Sridhar (2009) andRamachandra Guha point out, historically the north was viewed as the region whichwas growing and where job opportunities were being created whereas the southernstates were viewed as laggards. In recent years, however, this has changed, with thesouthern states surging economically. Hence, a study of the four southern states with their northern counterparts offers interesting lessons in contrast. In our comparisons of the northern region, we include the three newly created states (Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh) along with their parentstates because the new states were carved due to stark intra-state disparities andtheir backwardness. Also, when we are comparing the pre-2000 period with thepost-2000 period (2000 being the year in which the three new states were created), itis necessary to account for them in the interests of comparability. Before we examine the record of investment into these states, it is instructive to examine the differences in basic economic phenomena, such as NSDP and poverty rates. As discussed, these fundamental economic phenomena show remarkabledifferences between the southern and northern states when observed over a period oftime. Observing these phenomena over a long period of time has the advantage ofdemonstrating whether such disparities are a recent phenomenon or have existed fora prolonged period of time. Nunn (2009) provides a survey which gives a growingbody of empirical evidence pointing towards the important long-term effects that historic events have on current economic development. This paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the research objectives followed by the literature survey, which summarizes past literature on thesubject. This is followed by a section on the methodology followed bya description of trends in various explanatory factors - human capabilities, skills and awareness, resources and the efficiency of utilization, extent of urbanization, goodgovernance, including law and order, and infrastructure , which are presented for the southern and northern states. The final section pulls all findings together, summarizes the implications of the work and concludes. II. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES In this paper, we answer the question why some states have grown faster than others. An interesting issue to be explored in this context is whethera productive agricultural sector is a prerequisite for the growth of a manufacturingsector or whether comparative disadvantage in agriculture stimulates the growth of a manufacturing sector to ensure survival. One hypothesis is that with the relativeAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 4growth of manufacturing, the southern states may be growing faster than the northern states, which have a comparative advantage in agriculture. To understand the questions above, we observe trends and differences in economic phenomena, such as per capita income, poverty rates and economicopportunities such as investments and FDI flows observed across the southern andnorthern Indian states. As indicators of explanatory factors, we examine humancapabilities, skills and awareness, resources and the efficiency of the utilization of those skills, the extent of urbanization, good governance including law and order, and infrastructure across the southern and northern states. We present trends inimportant indicators of these differences in economic phenomena and explanatoryfactors, following the literature survey in the next section. III. LITERATURE SURVEY There is a vast amount of literature dealing with economic growth and on convergence/divergence in Indian states. There is also a lengthy literature onintergovernmental transfers in India which shows how the fiscal disparities of the poorer states have not been adequately offset by the transfer system and how various types of subnational transfers can discourage equalization (Rao and Singh, 2005).Our paper should not be viewed as an addition to the general literature on interstatedisparities. There is another strand of literature which examines the sources andtiming of the shift in Indian output growth since the 1980s. This literature addressesa variety of questions such as: When did the shift in growth occur? Was the shift uniform across states? What were the factors causing the shift? Based on a review of this literature, we find that none of the studies take the distinct, north-south approachwe take in this paper. We divide this literature survey into parts - one part dealing with the timing and extent of disparities among Indian states, and another part critically summarizingthe literature which explains the factors behind interstate differentials, highlighting thecontribution of this work. Disparities across Indian states First, we discuss the literature on disparities across the Indian states and the timing of the shift, if any. Nair 's (1982) pioneering analysis covered 14 major states. The study showed that interstate disparities in per capita NSDP , as measured by thecoefficient of variation (CV), had declined over the period 1950-51 to 1964-65, butincreased between 1964-65 and 1976-77. Unfortunately, this paper is quite dated and does not take into account post-1983 developments.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 5Roy Choudhury (1993) examines interstate disparities and reported that the coefficient of variation (CV) of per capita NSDP in current prices had increasedbetween 1967-68 and 1977-78, but declined between 1977-78 and 1985-86.However, the CV in terms of constant prices showed a persistent increase duringthe entire period 1967-68 to 1985-86. While this kind of analysis is useful forpurposes of this work, Roy Choudhury 's (1993) study does not cover enough of the post-liberalization period for us to make an assessment. Dholakia (1994) in his analysis of interstate disparities in growth rates of 20 Indian states over the 30-year period 1960-61 to 1989-90 identified empiricallythe optimal years of shift in growth separately for each state through the estimation ofa kinked exponential trend curve model. This analysis is interesting, but does notdelve into causes of the interstate disparities in growth rates, which is much requiredand is attempted in this paper. Das and Barua (1996) examined several dimensions of regional economic disparities among 23 states/union territories during the period from 1970 to 1992. It was found that interstate inequality increased in almost all sectors. This paper suffersfrom the same limitation as the earlier papers in that it does not attempt to explain theinequality in the sectors among the states. Mathur (2001) analysed several facets of national and regional economic growth since the 1950s, with a specific focus on the 1980s and 1990s. The studyreported a steep acceleration in the coefficient of variation of per capita incomes inthe post-reform period of 1991-96, just as we find here (see the next section on trends in various indicators). A tendency towards convergence was noticed within the group of middle-income states, while divergence was evident within the groups ofhigh- and low-income states. Unfortunately, the paper goes no further in explainingthe convergence or divergence among the states, but some of its findings are ofrelevance to what we find in this paper. Kurian (2000) drew attention to interstate disparities by presenting recent data for Indian states on demographic characteristics, social characteristics, magnitude and structure of SDP , poverty ratio, developmental and non-developmental revenue expenditures, eighth plan outlay and its sectoral distribution, disbursal offinancial assistance for investment, indicators of physical infrastructure developmentand of financial infrastructure. The paper found that a sharp dichotomy between theforward and backward groups of states had emerged. 2 This paper takes a holistic 2Kurian's (2000) forward group consists of Pradesh and West Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 6view of development in the states, but does not explain the causes of the observed dichotomy. Kurian also groups together all states with high per capita income andothers with low per capita income, without making a distinction as to when thesechanges occurred. Wallack (2003) finds evidence for a break in the GDP growth rate in the early 1980s. This is close to the result reported by Rodrik and Subramanian (2005).Hausmann and others (2005) analyzed transitions to higher growth in a large cross-national sample, and date the Indian growth break to 1982. However, their paper primarily deals with India in a cross-national sample and attempts to explainthe Indian growth take-off in the early 1980s. They do not delve into the subnationalor regional levels, as we do here. Virmani (2006) finds that the growth rate of manufacturing in Indian states accelerated after 1980-81, and this contributed to the acceleration in growth of GDPfrom 1981-82. Virmani finds no additional breakpoints in the 1990s once the breakpoint in 1980-81 is accounted for. It can be stated that the purpose of all these studies appears to be to examine when a break appeared in the growth rate of Indianstates without worrying about why or how the break occurred. In contrast to Virmani (2006), Balakrishnan and Parameswaran (2007) find that the break in the growth rate of GDP occurred in 1978-79 - with the 1978-79 take-off in growth occurring prior to the positive break in manufacturing (1982-83).This suggests that the evidence for manufacturing having served as a primary engineof growth through appropriate market reforms is weak. In all fairness, in addition to the literature which summarizes the disparities among the states and the timing of a shift, there is a stream of literature which attempts to explain the interstate growth differentials. The next subsectionsummarizes this literature. Explanation of interstate growth differentials So far, a number of studies have attempted to explain the interstate differentials among Indian states. One of the earliest studies is a study of the northern and southern states in the United States of America by Olson (1984). This study explains the differences ineconomic performance in terms of endowments, policies and institutions. Theindependent variables include: the level of urbanization in 1889, lawyers per 100,000of the population, and labour union membership and the dependent variable is theeconomic growth rate. The hypothesis is that distributional coalitions should be moreAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 7powerful in places that have had stable freedom of organization. In the American study, the hypothesis is supported by regression results. Needless to say, this work isinspired by some variables used in the American study by Olson (1984). Ahluwalia (2000) explains interstate differences in the economic performance in terms of market development and the ability of Indian states to take advantage ofeconomic liberalization. He finds and argues that Rajasthan and Madhya Pradeshhave performed reasonably well in recent years. Sachs and others (2002) attempted a detailed qualitative assessment of the factors behind interstate growth differentials, and listed several possible hypotheses for the lack of unconditional convergence among Indian states: (a) The geographical differences in India are larger than in the United States, Europe and Japan; (b) Population movements in India respond very slowly to income differentials; (c) Policies of the national or state governments do not facilitate convergence; (d) Economic convergence is slower at lower levels of economic development, as in India. They also found that coastal access and climate are also factors in convergence, but they did not take into account the role of governance factors. In a largely agricultural country such as India, agricultural growth also may be expected to have some impact on growth. Panel data regressions by Shand and Bhide (2000) utilizing data from 15 states over three time periods (1972-82, 1982-90, and 1992-95) suggested that agricultural growth has a positive impact on industrialand service sector growth. Agricultural growth, in turn, was affected positively byland productivity in agriculture and negatively by the share of agriculture. While theregression results are useful in understanding growth, the paper does not go beyondeconomic factors. It is plausible that a state 's initial distribution of income and private investment impacts its current per capita income. Rao and others (1999) analyzed the determinants of growth of per capita SDP with data for the 14 major Indian states.The coefficient on the initial income variable was significantly positive in theregressions for longer periods (1965-94, 1970-94 and 1975-94). The variableindicating private investment was found to be the most important determinant ofgrowth. Next in importance was the literacy variable. We find this paper ignores the role of non-economic factors, such as governance.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 8Nagaraj and others (2000) gathered various factors together and used panel data for 17 states for the years 1960-94. The growth regression included, apart fromlagged per capita SDP , the share of agriculture, the relative price of agricultural andmanufactured goods, several infrastructure indicators and fixed effects for states asexplanatory variables. Evidence for conditional convergence was found. The resultsof the study suggested that focusing investment efforts on physical infrastructure (electricity, irrigation and railways), and social infrastructure (human development) would raise the overall effectiveness of public investment and raise growth. However,factors such as law and order and health-related indicators such as infant mortalityexplain differences in growth, which are not taken into account by this paper. It is clear that urbanization and industrialization have a role to play in increasing per capita income. Ghate and Wright (2008) find that the ratio ofIndian to United States per capita output over the past 45 years has displayed a distinctive V-shaped pattern. 3 They show that a strikingly similar V-shaped pattern is visible not just in aggregate output figures, but also as the primary determinant oflong-term movements in the cross-sectional distribution within the all-India total, atboth sectoral and state output levels. They also carry out preliminary investigations ofcorrelates of the \"V-factor \", using a new panel data set for Indian states from 1960 to 2005 that extends and encompasses all previous data sets relevant tomacroeconomic analysis of the Indian states. Ghate and Wright (2008) find that \"V\" states: Were on average more urbanized and more literate; 4 Were somewhat more industrialized and somewhat less dependent on agriculture; Spent somewhat less on development (revenue expenditure) than non- \"V\" states. We find that Ghate and Wright (2008), like the others, focus on economic factors, such as infrastructure, but do not take into account the role of law and orderor political factors in explaining growth. It is reasonable to expect that the law and order situation in a state would impinge upon private investment, economic growth 3Their approach in using the United States as a benchmark may be debatable, but given that the United States is the head of the technological frontier and the standard neo-classical model would predictthat growth rates converge to the country on the technology frontier, their choice is somewhatunderstandable. Pradesh, two are included in the non-V states because they fit the convergence model (higheraverage income in the 1980s, lower growth in the 1990s).Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 9and the environment. States which are in turmoil with regard to law and order would not be viewed as good places to do business. While per capita income is only one measure of economic performance, there are studies that examine reduction in poverty. Agricultural productivitydetermines the extent of rural poverty. Datt and Ravallion (1998) study the causes ofrural poverty in a developing rural economy and question as to why some Indianstates have done better than others at reducing rural poverty. They model the evolution of various poverty measures using pooled state-level data for the period 1957-91. Differences in trend rates of rural poverty reduction are attributed todiffering growth rates of farm yield per acre and differing initial conditions; statesstarting with better infrastructure and human resources saw significantly higherlong-term rates of poverty reduction. Deviations from trend are attributed to inflation(which hurt the poor in the short term) and shocks to farm and non-farm output. This paper, while being quite insightful, unfortunately does not cover institutional factors, such as the existence of the minimum support price to farmers and their impact onreducing rural poverty. In addition to agricultural growth, productivity, initial income, private investment, infrastructure, urbanization and industrialization, we would expectsweeping changes in policy also to affect economic performance. Rodrik andSubramanian (2005) argue - in similar vein to Virmani (2006) - that the improvement in India 's economic performance was driven by policy changes. In particular, Rodrik and Subramanian argue that the trigger for India 's upward break in growth - which they pin down to around 1980 - occurred because of an \"attitudinal shift \" on the part of the national Government in 1980 in favour of businesses. While takinga cross-national focus, this is one of the few papers that take into account theimportance of non-economic factors in growth, which needs to be noted. Similarly, Basu (2004) provides empirical evidence from a study of 16 major Indian states for the period from 1980 to 2001 that, under the economic reform process, better institutional mechanisms could actually help economies to grow faster with higher level of economic well-being. This paper estimates the economicwell-being index (by aggregating 15 socio-economic variables, i.e., education,infrastructure, technological progress, income, and so on) and an index of goodgovernance (by aggregating 13 variables indicating rule of law, governmentfunctioning, public services, press freedom, and the like) by multivariate statistical measures. Panel regression showed that governance measures, and economic policy variables are crucial to explain the differential level of development performanceacross states in India during the last two decades. It is worthy to note that this is oneof the few papers to take into account the impact of governance and institutionalfactors on differential economic performance of the states.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 10An important survey article on interregional disparities by Krishna (2004) focuses on issues of growth variability and volatility in Indian states. The coefficientof variation of year-to-year growth rates for a state is used as a measure of volatility.The four most volatile states in India were Orissa, Rajasthan, Gujarat and UttarPradesh while the three least volatile states were Punjab, Maharashtra and Kerala.However, volatility has been declining at the national level since the 1980s. The author notes that the dispersion of growth rates of states increased considerably in the post reform period (from 15 per cent in the 1980s to 27 per cent in the 1990s).Further analysis shows that agriculture has a positive impact on industrial and servicesector growth. Also, social infrastructure is an important determinant of theinvestment decisions. The author however stresses that there is a need to exploreother approaches to explain economic growth from all perspectives. Ashraf and others (2008) assess quantitatively the effect of exogenous health improvements on output per capita in general (not with specific reference to India). They find that the effects of health improvements on per capita income aresubstantially lower than those that are often quoted by policymakers, and may notemerge at all for three decades or more after the initial improvements in health areimplemented. These results suggest that proponents of efforts to improve health indeveloping countries should rely on humanitarian rather than economic arguments. Ghosh (2006) evaluates the relative performance of 15 major Indian states regarding human development, and examines the relationship between this and economic growth. The estimates of cross-sectional growth regressions provide strong evidence of regional convergence in human development despite considerabledivergence in real per capita income, indicating that the poor states that have failed tocatch up with the rich ones in terms of per capita income have managed to catch upin terms of human development. The results suggest that the sequencing of policyshould be such that the human development-induced growth process has to be strengthened so that states can transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle category. Although the findings from this paper make sense, it focuses only on the relationshipbetween human development and economic growth without taking into account otherfactors that impinge upon economic performance. Banerjee and Iyer (2005) analyze the colonial land revenue institutions set up by the British in India, and show that differences in historical property rightsinstitutions lead to sustained differences in economic outcomes using district-wise growth rates. They find that areas in which proprietary rights in land were historically given to landlords have significantly lowered agricultural investments and productivityin the post-independence period than in areas where these rights were given to thecultivators. This is similar to the effects Besley and Burgess (2000) find for the impactof land reform on rural poverty.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 11While the differential rate of growth among Indian states and the issue of convergence have been probed extensively, as is clear from the literature reviewedabove, few studies have searched for an explanation for the difference between thenorthern and the southern Indian states, taking into account the role of botheconomic and non-economic factors. While past research had focused mostly oneconomic factors, we take into account both economic and non-economic factors, such as law and order, that impinge upon growth in the northern and southern Indian states. The next two sections briefly describe the methodology used in the paper toanswer these questions, and focus on analysing economic trends as well as otherexplanatory indicators used in this study. IV. METHODOLOGY The theory is that growth in emerging economies is driven by differences in human capabilities, skills and awareness, resources and their utilization, extent ofurbanization, good governance (including law and order), and infrastructure. We believe these factors explain the disparities in investments, economic opportunities and other economic phenomena, such as poverty and per capita income. Below wedescribe trends in the indicators we have chosen for each of these factors and thendiscuss them. We attempted several regressions (see Sridhar and Reddy, 2009) butdid not have long enough time-series data for informative results. Therefore, we donot report them here. Most of the data we examine as it relates to economic phenomena, investment opportunities, human capabilities and skills (educational and health indicators), infrastructure, urbanization, and resource utilization exists from the 1980sonwards (although some exist only decennially for the census years). Reasonabletime-series data (going back to the 1960s) does not exist for all the indicators (withthe exception of per capita net state domestic product (NSDP) and installedgenerating capacity (of electricity)). Hence, we first examine historical trends in each of the above indicators to study if some relationship exists between economic phenomena, and urbanization, governance, infrastructure and human capabilities. Asdiscussed above, observing these phenomena over a period of time has theadvantage of demonstrating whether such disparities across the southern andnorthern states are a recent phenomenon or whether they have existed for a longperiod of time.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 12V. TRENDS IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS In this section, we present trends in various socio-economic indicators, such as domestic product, poverty, investment and economic opportunities more generallyfor the northern and southern Indian states separately. It is easy to believe that per capita income is determined by private investment, which creates jobs and income. Per capita income is one of the most fundamental economic phenomena which reflect economic living conditions of thepopulation. This is one variable on which a reasonably long time series of data wasavailable (unlike the poverty rate, data on which was available only for a few years).Hence, per capita NSDP was chosen as a measure of aggregate economicperformance of the states, as is commonly done. Figure 1 summarizes the trend of the average weighted per capita NSDP of the southern states (Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh). 5 This figure shows that, on average, the per capita NSDP of the southern states (weighted withpopulation) is on a much higher trajectory compared with that of the northern states. 5For purposes of reasonable comparison, the data for Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh Uttaranchal respectively from 1993-94 onwards. Althoughthese three new states themselves came into existence only in 2000, the EPWRF had reconstructed thepopulation and NSDP data series for the new states from 1993-94 onwards, based on the new districtsforming these states.Figure 1. Trends in per capita NSDP, southern and northern states, 1960-06, 1999-00 prices Source NSDP, South Average per capita NSDP (weighted), northAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 13Further, the divergence between the two groups has been increasing since the early 1990s.6 This is a source of concern. We corroborate the disparities in per capita income with data on rural and urban poverty in the southern and northern states. While aggregate per capitaincome portrays the general economic conditions of the state, the prevalence ofpoverty indicates the extent of distress. The rural and urban poverty data painta picture similar to that of the NSDP , showing greater prevalence of economic distress in the northern states. Figure 2 summarizes the disparities in rural poverty (weighted with the population of each respective state) between the southern and northernstates. The rural poverty rate summarized in figure 2 refers to the proportion of ruralpopulation in the states living below the poverty line. Figure 2 shows that the extent of rural poverty is much greater in the northern than in the southern states, where it has been declining at a more rapid rate(since 1988) than in the northern states and the disparities are widening. 7 The extent 6These disparities are based on per capita NSDP data when they are expressed in 1999-00 prices. When per capita NSDP is expressed in 1993-94 constant prices as well, one finds a similar trend with thedivergence beginning in the early 1990s. 7It may be noted that the poverty series in both figures 2 and 3 end in 2004-05.Figure 2. Trends in the rural poverty rate, southern and northern states Source : Planning Commission, Government of India.010203040506070 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 Average rural poverty, South Average rural poverty, NorthAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 14of rural poverty is directly determined by agricultural yield, agricultural wages and the availability of non-farm employment (see Besley and Burgess, 2000; Fan, and others,2000). However, historically, the southern states have not always had this edge. For instance, Datt and Ravallion (1998) report nearly 70 per cent rural poverty each for Tamil Nadu and Kerala in 1960 and 65 per cent for Andhra Pradesh, 8 compared with only a 48 per cent rural poverty rate each for Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan in 1960.Madhya Pradesh and Bihar had rural poverty rates of about 55 and 65 per centrespectively in 1960, according to Datt and Ravallion. This suggests that poverty wasmuch more acute in the case of the southern states earlier on, but they were able toreduce it rapidly at some point. Our objective is to understand when, how and why this took place. The disparities in urban poverty rates across the southern and northern states (when weighed with population) are much lower than with rural poverty(figure 3). Figure 3. Trends in the urban poverty rate, southern and northern states 8Karnataka was the only southern state according to Datt and Ravallion (1998) to have had a lower rural poverty rate of 52 per cent even as of 1960.Source : Planning Commission, Government of India.0102030405060 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003Average urban poverty, South Average urban poverty, NorthAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 15In 1973, the urban poverty rates in the northern states were higher than in the south, but by 1993, the urban poverty rates in both the northern and southern stateswere the same. They started declining more rapidly in the south (figure 3). While ruralpoverty is closely related to productivity in the agricultural economy, urban poverty isrelated to the availability of urban employment, the prevalence of rural-urbanmigration and the level of urban wages. Summarizing the disparities in fundamental economic characteristics, the northern states are characterized by lower per capita income with greater rural and urban poverty than the south. The rural poverty rates across the two groups of statesstarted to diverge in 1988, whereas disparities in urban poverty rates startedincreasing much later, in 1993. Finally, per capita NSDP started diverging in the early1990s. Based on their relative performance in aggregate economic phenomena, it is plausible to believe that there are significant disparities between the southern and northern states in terms of their economic environment, opportunities and potential for investment. Paul and Sridhar (2009) examined which sector(s) led the surge in per capita NSDP which is observed in Tamil Nadu, a southern Indian state as compared with thatin Uttar Pradesh, a northern Indian state. Figures 4 to 6 show the trend in thecomposition of NSDP by sector (respectively agriculture, industry and services) inthese two states. In regard to the share of agriculture, Uttar Pradesh is always aboveTamil Nadu. In the share of industry, Tamil Nadu scores well over Uttar Pradesh for all but the last couple of years. It did seem that during the last few years, the share of the industrial sector in Uttar Pradesh caught up with that in Tamil Nadu andsurpassed it. Figure 4. Share of agriculture in NSDP, northern and southern states 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 (weighted) South Share of Agriculture (weighted) NorthAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 16The service sector data is interesting. Until 1980-81, the two states were more or less identical as far as the service sector share was concerned. After 1981,however, the service sector in Uttar Pradesh declined in its share in NSDP whencompared with that in Tamil Nadu, where there was a constant increase. So there aregrounds to believe that the service sector led the surge in per capita incomes in TamilNadu. This is consistent with the national growth story. Figure 5.

They also reflect underlying conditions, such asinfrastructure and public services, which influence the location choice of firms(see Sridhar and Wan). The differences between the southern states and the northern states are very pronounced in terms of the amount of actual investments. Figure 7 summarizes this trend separately for the two groups of states (weighted with population). The southis significantly ahead of the northern states in attracting investment. The northernstates are in a permanent low-level equilibrium as far as investment inflows areconcerned, with inflows amounting to a meagre Rs 1.7 trillion when compared to theaverage of Rs 4.74 trillion for the southern states from 1995 to 2003. 10 There is a need to explain these disparities in economic opportunities and lack of investor interest in the northern states. This is consistent with what Kurian (2000) reports for the states. If these trends continue in investment, the northern states could stand to lose substantially interms of investment, jobs and income. Clearly, there are some fundamentaldifferences between these two sets of states which need to be explained. Inter- and intraregional disparities within the country can lead to civil and social unrest. They also can lead to migration resulting in undesirable consequences.Hence, it is important to understand trends in these disparities and study what is causing them. A better understanding of the factors underlying regional disparities will throw better light on economic and investment opportunities available in theIndian states. As a result, researchers, state governments and investors stand tobenefit from this research. 9We had data from the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce, Government of India, regarding the number and amount of FDI approvals and domestic investmentsapproved. However, given that there usually is a significant difference between the FDI approvals,domestic investment approvals and actual investments, and the number of approvals does not translatein terms of actual investments, we use data on actual investments made by firms in various states, fromCMIE's CAPEX database. 10The figure presents data for 1995 to 2003. While we had (unweighted) data on actual investment flows until 2009 for all the states we study, the data on population were not available beyond 2003, withthe result that we could not report weighted averages beyond that year.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 18The following section focuses on indicators for the variables which explain differences in the economic phenomena observed across the northern and southernstates. First, we describe what indicators have been chosen for each of theexplanatory factors, we then highlight the rationale for the expected effects of each of the variables on economic performance, following which trends in the explanatory indicators are described in a subsequent section. Indicators of Human Capabilities Some measures of human capabilities may be represented by education, and health care indicators. More precisely, these education and health indicators might be respectively: literacy rate; proportion of graduates; proportion of population enrolled in technical courses; and infant mortality rate. In addition, we examine thepercentage of the population in working age groups, and on the supply side, thenumber of institutions of higher education in the states.Figure 7. Disparities in actual investment flows, north and southern states Source : Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) CAPEX Database 000600 000700 000 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 Weighted average, South Weighted average, NorthAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 19The literacy rate can be expected to positively affect economic growth and per capita income in the states primarily because it is a measure of the knowledgeand awareness of the population. Our assumption is that a higher literacy rateprepares one for higher skills, the ability to deal with higher technology, and thediscretion to make rational choices. A more literate population is able to use its skillsproductively to generate more output and income. The proportion of graduates and the proportion of those enrolled in technical courses also positively impact the per capita income because of their effects on creating a labour pool with certain skills. The proportion of graduates reflects thepercentage of population that has attained a certain threshold level of educationwhich equips them with certain skills needed for specific kinds of economic activity.Hence, an increase in the proportion of graduates can be expected to increase theworkforce participation rate of the population and enable them to contribute to increased output and income. The proportion of technical manpower can bring about growth and has the potential to increase incomes since investors are usually attractedto a pre-existing pool of manpower with certain skills. We may expect the percentage of population in working age groups to affect per capita income positively through their impact on output because only populationin the working age groups is likely to contribute to output increases. 11 Turning to health indicators, the infant mortality rate (IMR) across a state is an indicator of its progress on health. While this factor does not directly affectinvestment in the state, it can nevertheless be viewed as an indicator which reflects the economic capability of the workforce. Good health enhances the productivity of the population. The IMR indicates prenatal care, maternal care and the existence ofchild-care facilities, indicating maternal mortality, fertility rate and the death rate of thepopulation. It indicates the stage of demographic transition the state is in. Ourassumption and expectation is that a lower IMR of population implies that the state 's population is healthy. Empirical studies have repeatedly brought out the finding that hospitalization is one of the most important reasons for indebtedness and abject poverty, especially in rural areas (see George, 2009). Hence, we assume that stateswith a lower IMR are healthier. A healthy population is capable of producing moreoutput and income. 11The working age group is defined as the population in the age groups 15-59 years. Only for 1971 was data on population in the upper age limit not available; hence, we used population greater than15 years as those being in the working age group. As this was the same problem for all the states,however, we do not expect their relative positions to change.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 20Indicators of Governance: Law and order Governance refers to the functioning of governments and public institutions that impact on economic activities and the lives of citizens (Paul and Sridhar, 2009). When the processes of public decision-making and implementation of policies are carried out with credibility, transparency and accountability, governance is consideredgood. Given its complex nature and scope, however, it is far more difficult to defineand measure governance than the other factors discussed above. In this paper, governance has been equated with law and order. This was done because of the absence of data on other variables which reflect governance. AsPaul and Sridhar (2009) point out, it is extremely difficult and challenging to come up with measures of governance that reflect the functioning of public institutions. A sound law and order system is essential for economic and social progress. Based on open-ended discussions with senior police officials, we came up with twomeasures of governance or law and order: (a) police firing incidents per millionpopulation and (b) percentage of pending cases under trial in courts. We selectedpolice firings per million population as an indicator of the law and order condition ina state because it signals the intensity of agitation between groups, and the ability or inability of the administration to bring them under control or a combination of both. Because police firings are widely and regularly reported, they can add to uncertaintyin the minds of investors and can adversely impact the smooth functioning ofa society and its economic activity. Law and order may also be represented by events which capture the efficiency and effectiveness of the judiciary, such as the proportion of pending casesin the court. 12 One common measure that is chosen to reflect governance is corruption - the use of monetary or non-monetary bribes to have work done in government or public institutions. There are no reliable subnational data on these measures. However, the fact that other measures of governance have been useddoes not imply that corruption and other measures of governance have been ignored,as Paul and Sridhar (2009) point out. Good governance does manifest itself in lawand order. For example, when law and order break down (as reflected in risingnumber of incidents of police firing), the public may be forced to resort to corruption. Similarly, when the public image of a place is that it is disorderly or when court cases take a long time to resolve (pending judicial cases), entrepreneurs will refrain from 12In order to arrive at these indicators, we had open-ended discussions with the Director-General of Police in Karnataka on the role that law and order play and how it impinges on the economic environmentand economic growth in the state. He suggested that the number of incidents of police firing and thepercentage of civil to armed police are good indicators which capture the public agitation mood in thestate which impinges on their economic and investment environment.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 21investing in that state since they look for a stable environment and speedy redress of grievances in the event of disputes. Sound law and order is also essential for theretention of a skilled workforce. Hence, the measures we chose are reflective ofpublic functioning and the governance of a state. Specifically, we expect that the greater the police firing incidents per million population, the lower the per capita income would be. Similarly, the greater thepercentage of cases pending trial, the lower would be the per capita income, for reasons discussed above. We also examined SLL (cases reported under local and special laws) crimes. These refer to crimes committed under the Arms Act, Opium Act, Gambling Act,Excise Act, Prohibition Act, Explosives and Explosive Substances Act, Motor VehiclesAct, Prevention of Corruption Act, Customs Act, Indian Railways Act, and otheroffences. We have already demonstrated that corruption is reflected in the law andorder situation. Similar is the case with crimes committed under the Explosives and Explosive Substances Act, which is likely to be reflected in police firing incidents. Most of the other SLL crimes noted above are private crimes and do not reflect thegeneral law and order condition of the state. Furthermore, the reporting of many ofthese crimes is determined by the filing of a First Information Report (FIR). If no FIR isfiled, then these crimes are not reflected in the data. However, since data on policefirings and pending court cases are reported widely, we chose them to reflectgovernance and public functioning. Thus the measures of law and order we choose reflect to a substantial degree the governance of a state. We consider our work pioneering in that we find that no other earlier studies (with a few exceptions as we noted) have examinednon-economic factors, such as law and order and their impacts on the economicenvironment. Measures of infrastructure Why is infrastructure important for economic growth and investment? Infrastructure is an important enabler of economic growth. Electricity is required formanufacturing; telecommunications are necessary for reducing firms ' transaction costs; good roads are required for transportation of inputs and connectivity tomarkets. Mani and others (1996) find that power availability rather than its price,reliable infrastructure and factors of production played significant roles in decisions regarding the location of firms across major Indian states. In line with this literature, our chosen measures of infrastructure or public services are (a) installed capacity forgenerating electricity and (b) penetration of telecommunications.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 22First, we take the instance of electricity - installed capacity in the states. While electricity consumption is concomitant with growth and may be expected to increase monotonically with growth, installed capacity is a precondition for growth. Installed capacity is critical for manufacturing processes and is necessary to increaseoutput and raising per capita incomes. Another measure of physical infrastructure we examine is the percentage of households with electricity. This indicates the extent to which electricity is extensively available in the state. However, given that the percentage of households with electricity could be correlated with the installed generating capacity in a state, weinclude only installed capacity in the estimation, although we present trends anddisparities in the percentage of households with electricity connections across thenorthern and southern states. Telecommunications are crucial for firms in reducing their transaction costs (see Norton, 1992; Roller and Waverman, 2001) and for increasing organizational efficiencies, output and per capita incomes. The literature conclusively shows that tele-density has positive impacts on growth. A number of researchers havehypothesized that telecommunication infrastructure lowers both the fixed costs ofacquiring information and the variable costs of participating in markets (Norton, 1992).They point out that, as such infrastructure improves, transaction costs decline, andoutput increases for firms in various sectors of the economy. Sridhar (2007) foundpositive impacts of mobile and landline phones on national output when controlled for the effects of capital and labour. Hence, we expect both installed capacity and tele-density to have positive effects on the economic environment in the states, especially for manufacturing, andpositively impact per capita NSDP . Indicators of resources We choose per capita public (both capital and revenue) expenditure as an indicator of resources available to a state which could endogenously determine its per capita NSDP . This is because it is assumed that all public expenditure translates intooutput of goods and services, increasing per capita NSDP . This could be endogenoussince rising public expenditure could be partly financed out of rising NSDP . However,we circumvent endogeneity by using the lagged form of this variable. While currentyear expenditure can be endogenous, per capita income in a current year cannot impact a previous year 's expenditure.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 23Measures of urbanization We use the percentage of urban population in a state as the measure of urbanization which we expect will impact per capita income. Urbanization is a causal factor underlying high per capita incomes because scale economies and agglomeration economies make it possible to accumulate output rapidly. How isurbanization defined in India 's context? The Census of India defines settlements having the following characteristics as urban areas: (a) A population of five thousand or more; (b) A minimum density of 1,000 people per square mile; (c) At least 75 per cent of workforce outside agriculture. It should be mentioned that India 's definition of urbanization is quite conservative when compared with that of China where all areas with a minimum of 10 per cent non-agricultural employment are classified as urban. As Cohen (2004) argues, if India were to reclassify its urban areas using a more liberal definition,a majority of India would be urban today. In fact, higher levels of urbanization alsoattract firms to locate, invest and create jobs due to urbanization economies andlocalization economies. Trends in explanatory factors: Human capabilities In this section, we review the trends and disparities in the explanatory factors. Figure 8 compares the average weighted (with population) literacy rateacross the southern and northern states over time. Figure 8 shows that the southern states ' literacy rate has always been at a higher level when compared with that of their northern counterparts. Further, therate of growth of literacy also has been occurring at the same rate in the two regions,with the result that the northern states ' literacy rate has remained well below that of the south as of 2001. Despite its remarkable stability when compared with per capita NSDP (which is quite volatile, see figure 1), we surmise that the literacy rate may havebeen one of the preconditions necessary for economic growth to have taken off in thesouthern states. In terms of examining trends in educational outcomes, we do not stop at the literacy rate. We compare the trends in the average proportion of graduates(or above) from 1971 to 2001 between the southern and northern states as yet another educational measure.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 24Figure 8. Trends in literacy rate, southern and northern Indian states Source : Census of India and authors ' computations. Figure 9 compares the trend in the average weighted proportion of graduates during 1971 to 2001 for the southern and northern states separately. The interesting finding here is that the northern states had on average the same proportion of graduates as the southern states, from 1971 to 1981. However, they gradually lost out to the southern states, from 1991 to 2001 (figure 9). Thus, we have more evidence here that the surge in the south is a more recent phenomenon,not historical. Over and above general graduates, we made an attempt to examine the proportion of technical manpower in the two groups of states. Enrolment in andgraduation with degrees in technical courses, such as B.E. (Bachelor 's of Engineering), B.Sc. (Bachelor 's in Science), B.Arch. (Bachelor 's in Architecture), Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy, Ayurvedic and Unani, B.Ed. (Bachelor 's in Education), and B.T. (Bachelor 's in Technology) have a role in the building of a skilled labour force. So we compared enrolment by year in (all the above) technical degreecourses as a proportion of the population in the relevant age group (above 15 years)01020304050607080 1961 1971 1981 1991 2001 Average weighted literacy rate, South Average weighted literacy rate, NorthAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 25Figure 9. Proportion of graduates, south and northern states, 1971-2001 to examine if the southern states have anything more of an edge compared with their northern counterparts (see figure 10).13 Certainly, the southern states have a larger skilled and technical labour force when compared with the northern states for all theyears of study. All these measures of human capabilities and skills can be expected to impact not only the per capita income through their effect on skilled jobs, but also impact investment due to the existence of a pool of skills which impact firm locationSource : Census of India and authors ' computations. 13The methodology we used to arrive at the enrolment in these technical courses as a proportion of population above 15 years of age, from 2001 to 2005 is as follows: We took the age-wise distribution ofpopulation in 2001 from the 2001 Census for all the states. Then we assumed that the same age-wisedistribution of population holds good for the period from 2002 to 2005. Since we had the state-wisepopulations during the period from 2002 to 2005, we applied the age distribution (of population above15 years of age) of 2001 to obtain population above 15 for the non-Census year. Then we took theenrolment in the technical courses as a proportion of the population above 15 years of age. Next, weaveraged this proportion for the southern states and the northern states (including Jharkhand,Uttaranchal and Chhattisgarh) separately. Although we tried, we were unable to obtain data for earlieryears on this important indicator.0123456 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 Average weighted % graduates, South Average weighted % graduates, NorthPer centAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 26Figure 10.

In fact, it is plausible to believe that technology giants such as Infosys and WIPRO have located in Bangalore only because of the pre-existence of a large pool ofskilled and technical workforce there. Paul and Sridhar (2009) report that the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu had a total of over 540 engineering colleges in 2008 compared to only 11 colleges in the 1970s. They report that Uttar Pradesh, onthe other hand, had less than half this number of engineering colleges despite havinga head start in this arena in the nineteenth century. On the labour market aspects, we examined the percentage of the population in the working age groups. Figure 11 presents the disparity across thenorthern and southern states in terms of their working age group population. Figure 11 shows that, although the northern and southern states were the same as far as the percentage of population in working age group is concerned in 1961, there was a divergence after 1971, when there was a steady increase in theworking age population in the southern states when compared with that of the north.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 27Figure 11.

To obtain this information, we aggregated data on the number of colleges from the Census town directories.15 The assumption is that only towns and cities contain institutions of higher education, which is reasonable. There is also no source which would containthis data for rural areas as well. Figure 12 presents these data for the northern andsouthern states. Figure 12 shows that as with the other measures of human resources we observe, even with respect to higher educational institutions, the southern states have stolen a march over their northern counterparts. This must have created the 14We also obtained data on the man-days lost by state, but there was no reliable data on the number of man-days of employees or workers against which we could compare the man-days lost. Hence, thisvariable could not be used. 15Information on arts, science, commerce, engineering, medical and law colleges, vocational training institutes and polytechnics is included here.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 28Figure 12. Higher educational institutions, south and northern states Source : Census of India town directories and authors ' computations. necessary institutional capacity to turn out a large pool of skilled labour responsible for increasing levels of output and income. Thus, we find that in terms of educational outcomes measured in the literacy rate, proportion of graduates, enrolment in technical courses, proportion of population in the working age group and supply-side factors, such as the number of highereducational institutions, the southern states have an edge over the northern statesduring the entire period of our study. 16 Figure 13 summarizes the selected health indicator of human capabilities - the infant mortality rate (IMR), weighted by population of the respective states.Figure 13, which summarizes the historical trend in the infant mortality rate across the southern and northern states, shows that the southern states (with their lower IMR) have always been better than their northern counterparts, consistent with ourexpectation. This implies better prenatal medical care and related facilities in thesouth, which implies a population with a much better health and productivity than inthe north, although the IMR in the northern states has been declining post-1991.05001 0001 5002 0002 5003 000 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001Weighted average, South Weighted average, North 16A caveat to note is that the mere existence of a large number of educational institutions in the southern region does not mean that enrolments consists only of people from the southern states or thatthe graduates of these institutions necessarily constitute the labour force for the industries in the south.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 29These trends in education and health, which are indicators of human capabilities and skills, strongly suggest that at least some of the southern states have had an advantage historically over their northern counterparts. Trends and disparities in governance: northern and southern states We have already discussed the indicators of governance - police firing incidents (per million population) and proportion of pending court cases under trial.An examination of trends in police firing incidents and the proportion of pending cases in court (filed under the Indian Penal Code) is very revealing when we look at these separately for the southern and northern states. Figure 14 summarizes the trend in the average number of police firing incidents (per million population) separately for southern and northern states,weighted by their population. 17Figure 13.

During the 1990s, the south Indian states had relatively more incidences of police firing per million population when compared with that in the northern states.This is a surprising finding. After probing this, we found that such incidents in thesouth are dominated by Andhra Pradesh, which was characterized by frequent Naxalite disturbances (1987-2002) during which there was a sharp increase in the number of police firings. It should be noted that Andhra Pradesh, which is high onthis score (law and order problems), is lowest on the per capita income front amongthe southern states (implied in chart 1, see Paul and Sridhar, 2009). By and large, ifAndhra Pradesh were excluded, the number of police firing incidents in the southernstates would always be lower than in the north. Paul and Sridhar (2009) also find evidence of this. Next, we take the proportion of pending cases in courts in the two sets of states and examine their trends during 1991 to 2004. This is calculated as cases filedunder the Indian Penal Code pending trial in the courts as a proportion of the totalnumber of cases for trial including pending cases from previous years. Court casesshould be viewed as a measure of public faith in the judiciary, and pending casesdemonstrate its efficiency/inefficiency. Figure 15, which compares the weighted (weighted by the population of the respective states) proportion of cases pending trial in courts, shows that the judiciary0.000.501.001.502.002.503.003.504.00 Average police firing/million population (weighted), SouthAverage police firing/millionpopulation (weighted), North1988 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 31in the northern Indian states is quite inefficient when compared with that in the southern Indian states, where on average the proportion of cases pending trial stood at only 67 per cent as of 2004, compared with 76 per cent in the northern states (including the three new states - Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttaranchal). It may be argued that cases may be pending because the number of cases registered is higheror the number of judges lower. If the number of judges is lower, it means the state isunable to recruit judges to increase its efficiency. This is yet another indicator whichimpacts the economic environment in these states and is very representative, since investors also look for speedy redress of grievances in the event of disputes. We investigated the possibility of using other law and order measures such as the proportion of civil to total police force (consisting of civil and armed police).But since that is correlated with the number of police firing incidents, we decided touse the police firing incidents per 100,000 population. For instance, only when thenumber of police firing incidents is on the increase that we may expect armed policestrength in a state to increase. Hence, we expect that the number police firing incidents coupled with the number of court cases - both ongoing and pending provide reasonably good measures of law and order.Figure 15.

Trends in indicators of infrastructure Our findings with respect to the infrastructure indicators - installed generating capacity, and tele-density are interesting. We find that the southern statesare ahead of the northern states in these respects. Figure 16 summarizes weighted (weighted by the respective states ' population) installed capacity (thousands of kilowatts) per million population in thesouthern and northern states separately. These data series cover a reasonably long period of time. Not only was the installed capacity per million population always Figure 16.

We have ensured, based on our discussions with the CentralElectricity Authority, that it is possible for installed capacity to decline when old plants are retired or whenplants are degraded.lower in the northern than in the southern states, but also there was a widening of these disparities between them from the mid-1980s.18 The southern states experienced a continuous increase in their installed capacity after the 1990liberalization whereas the northern states likely faced several constraints with regardto installed capacity expansion. Because of this, their average weighted installedcapacity stagnated beginning from the mid-1980s. Thus, it is possible that a number of preconditions necessary for the existence of industry and services were getting ready in the southern states, which prepared them to take the plunge when thereforms of 1991 took place. Another measure of physical infrastructure we examine is the percentage of households with electricity. This indicates the extent to which electricity is extensivelyavailable in the state. Figure 17 summarizes the weighted proportion of households in Figure 17. Percentage of households with electricity, northern and southern states Source : Census of India, various years, and authors ' computations.01020304050607080 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 Weighted average, South Weighted average, NorthPer centAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 34Figure 18. Trends in tele-density: southern and northern states Source : Department of Telecommunications, Government of India.the two groups of states and presents the trends over time. This figure shows that the southern states clearly have a lead in the percentage of households withelectricity for all the years of our study. This implies that the southern states ' physical infrastructure was much better when compared with that of the northern states. Thisprepared the southern states to grow rapidly when the liberalization of 1991 tookplace. The northern, states with their low level equilibrium with regard to the electricity infrastructure, were not prepared, and therefore lagged behind even when the reforms of 1991 took place. Another measure of infrastructure we looked at relates to tele-density - the number of fixed land lines and mobile phones per 100 population for the southern andnorthern states. Figure 18 presents weighted tele-density (weighted with the states ' population) for the two sets of states. As with electricity, tele-density for the southernstates on average is not only much higher than that for the northern states for the limited period (1999-2004) over which we observe this, but it also increased at a much higher rate in the south than in the northern states over this period. 02468101214 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Average (weighted) teledensity, South Average (weighted) teledensity, NorthAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 35Recall that we have defined tele-density to consist both of land lines and mobile telephones. Given land lines are mostly offered by government operators(such as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited and soon), there is not much of a difference in penetration between the southern andnorthern states there. 19 The differences in total telephone penetration across the northern and southern states could be attributed to the extent of mobile telephone penetration, which is much higher in the southern states. This is primarily due to the competition prevalent in the mobile telephony sector (see Sridhar, 2007) which ismuch greater in the southern than in the northern states. We made an attempt to examine the road length in the northern and southern states. We did obtain data on this from the CMIE, but found that the road lengthdeclined during some years in most of the states. This suggests that there werechanges in road classification which were not captured by this database and hence are not reported here. In summary, all infrastructure indicators including installed capacity (electricity), percentage of households with electricity and tele-density, show clearadvantage for the southern states and steep disparities between the northern andthe southern states over a reasonably long period of time. This disparity continuesto widen even today. This strongly suggests that the southern states had allthe preconditions necessary for growth and were ready to take the plunge whenthe reforms of 1991 took place. However, the northern states, with their poor infrastructure and pre-conditions, were simply not ready to take advantage of the opportunities when economic liberalization started to take place in the country. Trends in resource utilization The efficiency with which resources are utilized has impact on economic growth. If resources are used in a manner that maximizes the useful goods and services derived from those resources, then we may expect greater economic growth to occur. The \"doing more with less \" slogan indicates the focus on more outputs with fewer impacts (fewer resources). While we focus on outputs with fewer resources, we are unable to examine other resource utilization impacts, such as that on thecondition of the poor (relating to equity), due to data limitations. 19The three new states created in 2000 (namely Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttaranchal) are still treated as part of the circles of their parent states, with the result that pre-2000 and post-2000, we arecomparing the same states.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 36Some measures of resources and their utilization would be public expenditures. We examined the trend in total expenditures20 (consisting of both developmental and revenue expenditure) on various social sectors (such as educationand public health) which are inputs. Figure 19 summarizes the average total (developmental and non- developmental) per capita expenditure of the southern states (weighted withpopulation), and that of the northern counterparts. The record of the southern and northern states in terms of spending (summarized in figure 19) indicates that the southern states took a leap forward in their developmental expenditures post-1991compared with their northern counterparts. However, the fact that the southernstates did not always have this advantage may be seen by the fact that, in the 1980s,the northern states ' per capita expenditure was more or less the same as that of the southern states. Ghate and Wright (2008) found that revenue expenditure by the V states was lower than by their non-V states. Figure 19. Total per capita expenditure, south and northern states Source : Economic and Political Weekly Research Foundation (EPWRF) and authors ' computations. 20This includes developmental expenditure incurred on the capital and the capita expenditure for Southern states Weighted per capita expenditure for northern states Next, we review the sectoral expenditure for the southern and northern states. When we examine such sectors as education and health, it is important totake into account total expenditures rather than merely capital expenditures. Much ofthe education and health outcomes depend upon the number of teachers and healthworkers and in respect of these items current/revenue expenditures constitute more than 80 per cent of the total expenditure. Thus, we compared total expenditures onAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 37sectors such as education and health with respective outcomes, such as the literacy rate, proportion of graduates, enrolment in technical courses, and infant mortalityrate. Figure 20 summarizes over time the average per capita (total) expenditure on education, sports and culture by the southern and northern states. 21 While we did not have this data disaggregated separately for education, sports and culture, we surmisethat the expenditure on education must account for a major part of this expenditure. Having noted this, figure 20 shows that the southern states spent less on education than the northern states during the 1980s. It was only after 1990 that the southernstates ' spending on education, sports and culture started diverging from that of the northern states. 22 It is not clear if the increased spending is a sign of inefficiency or indicates better outcomes. To assess this, we compared this expenditure on education torelevant outcomes in the southern and northern states. The foremost of educational outcomes is the literacy rate, which we have compared for the southern and northern Figure 20. Trends in total per capita expenditure on education, sports and culture, south and northern states Source : Economic and Political Weekly Research Foundation (EPWRF) and authors ' computations. 21In the case of education and health, the total expenditure was developmental expenditure on the capital and revenue account. There was no non-developmental expenditure reported. 22It must be mentioned that, as with the other indicators, for the northern set of states, we have included post-2000 data for the three newly created states - Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttaranchal,- so that the pre-2000 and post-2000 data are comparable.0100200300400500600700800 1980-811981-821982-831983-841984-851985-861986-871987-881988-891989-901990-911991-921992-931993-941994-951995-961996-971997-981998-991999-002000-012001-02 2002-032003-04 PC total expenditure on education, sports and culture (weighted) Southern states PC total expenditure on education, sports and culture (weighted) Northern statesAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 38states in figure 5. That figure clearly shows that the south has been well ahead of the north historically in terms of the level and progress of the literacy rate. This meansthat the per capita expenditures on education are either not completely reflected inthe literacy rate, or the southern states are more efficient (recall from figure 20 thattheir spending on this sector during the 1980s had been lower than that of thenorthern states) when compared with their northern counterparts as far as the outcomes are concerned. We have also compared the trends in the average proportion of graduates (or above) during 1971 to 2001 between the southern and northern states as yetanother educational outcome (see figure 9). We found that the surge of the south is amore recent phenomenon, rather than historical (recall that initially the southern andnorthern states had the same proportion of graduates until 1981). Even when wecompared enrolment in technical courses, we found that the southern states have a higher proportion of technical labour when compared with the northern states for all the years of study (figure 10). Thus, educational outcomes measured in terms of the literacy rate, proportion of graduates (post-1981), and the enrolment in technical courses, showthat the southern states have maintained an edge over the northern states. This is sodespite the fact that their spending on education has not been always higher thanthat of the northern states (figure 20, see the decade of the 1980s). Thus it must bethe case that the southern states ' expenditures on education are efficiently spent compared with those of the northern states. Next, we examined per capita expenditures by the states on public health and medical facilities. 23 Figure 21 summarizes the trends in per capita spending on public health and medical facilities in the south and northern states. Figure 21 showsconsiderable variability in the per capita expenditures on public health and medicalfacilities across the two set of states, with the spending of the southern statesdiverging from that of the northern states beginning from the late 1980s. We have already reviewed the outcomes of health spending - manifested in the infant mortality rate, which is lower for the southern states (see figure 13). Given that the southern states ' spending on public health was clearly lower than that of the northern states during the decade of the 1980s, but its health outcomes, such asIMR, were clearly better always, it must be the case that the quality of spending in thesouth is much better than in the northern states even as it relates to public health. 23As with the other indicators, for the northern set of states, we have included post-2000 data for the three newly created states - Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttaranchal, - so that the pre-2000 andpost-2000 data are comparable.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 39Figure 21.

In order to compare the expenditure on roads and bridges by the southern and northern states, we did not have reliable data on significant outcomes (roadlength) to enable us to make an assessment of this component of public spending. 24 We also had data related to spending on energy, which could have been easilycompared with the outcome on installed capacity generated, but the data on energy were not complete. 25 24We found in the case of some states that road length actually declined in some years, which is not plausible except in the event of a reclassification of roads. Further, we found that the data on road lengthfrom the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) was disaggregated by various types of roads,such as surfaced national highways, surfaced state highways, district roads, panchayat roads, urbanroads, project roads and so forth. But the length of different types of roads did not add up to the totalroad length reported. We attempted to contact CMIE regarding this, but did not obtain a satisfactoryresponse. 25We found negative values in the developmental expenditure on energy in the case of both the southern and northern states. Based on our discussions with the EPWRF, the actual developmentalexpenditure on energy is worked as follows: if the actual expenditure is Rs 100,000,000 during any givenyear and the receipts were Rs 116,000,000, then the -16,000,000 appears as deficit. The problem withusing these data is that they do not indicate what was spent, but only the deficit.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 40While in this section, we have compared the public expenditure on social sectors with their outcomes to assess the efficiency of spending, in the regression,we use total public expenditure per capita (lagged) as an explanatory variable. Disparities in Urbanization Given the importance of urbanization in increasing aggregate productivity and incomes, what do we observe with respect to the urbanization pattern of the southern states versus the northern states? Figure 22 shows that the southern states are way above the northern states in terms of the percentage of urbanization(weighted with population) since 1971. This indicates that the southern statesexperienced agglomeration and scale economies in production throughout the period,which must have contributed to increased aggregate output and their higher percapita incomes.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND IMPLICATIONS The important question examined by this paper is: Why have some Indian states grown faster than others? While our hypothesis was that, with the relativegrowth of manufacturing, the southern states may be growing faster than the northern Indian states, which have more comparative advantage in agriculture, we find that the service sector has led the surge in growth in the southern states (taking the example of Tamil Nadu). The additional purpose of the exposition in the previous sections ofthis paper has been to examine whether factors, such as human capabilities, skillsand awareness, infrastructure, governance, urbanization and resource utilization shedlight on the divergent paths of per capita income growth, divergent trends in poverty reduction, and disparities in FDI inflows and domestic investment observed across the southern and northern states. What do we gather from the analysis of disparities in these factors between the southern and northern states? It is possible that differences in the underlying andrelatively more stable conditions such as literacy rate, and infant mortality rate in thetwo set of states could at least in part account for the divergence in per capita incomeand poverty reduction although there could be some simultaneity there. Our premise is that the marked upward shift in per capita income and the subsequent reduction in poverty that the southern states experienced since the early 1990s can be attributedto the flow of substantial investments into these states. We find that, from 1995 to2003, the southern states attracted private investment worth Rs 4.74 trillion whencompared with an average of only Rs 1.7 trillion during the same period for thenorthern states. Based on our research and analysis, we surmise that disparitiesin governance, educational outcomes, urbanization, infrastructure and resource utilization could account for disparities in investment flows across the southern and northern states. A limitation is that this paper provides more descriptive and qualitative analysis than quantitative analysis. Therefore, policy conclusions need to be readwith caution. Being aware that we may not have taken into account some factors thatcould have contributed to the outcomes studied here (for instance, Paul and Sridhar(2009) discuss the impact of social movements and caste on education in the case of Tamil Nadu), the following specific findings from our analysis are worth noting: (a) With respect to most of the factors representing human capabilities - literacy, infant mortality, stock of graduates, enrolment in technicalcourses, and proportion of population in working age group, supply-side factors, such as the number of institutions of higher education,and infrastructure, such as installed capacity, percentage ofhouseholds with electricity and telephone penetration, the southernAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 42states had certainly an advantage over the northern states. We have to note that technical manpower (indicated by enrolment in technicalcourses), in which the southern states appear to have a lead, signalsa critical resource that modern industries and the service sectorneed. Unfortunately, data on this was not available for a reasonablylong time period for us to include it in the regression. Given this limitation, we surmise that the supply of this factor must have played a key role in the transformation that the south experienced from themid-1990s; (b) In terms of factors indicating law and order, such as the proportion of cases pending trial in courts, the southern states have an edge over their northern counterparts. With the exception of Andhra Pradesh,the number of police firing incidents was lower in the southern thanin the northern states. Based on this, we surmise that the potential(measured in terms of the initial conditions) for economic growthexisted more in the south than in the north; (c) With respect to total per capita spending and per capita spending on education and public health, while the southern states spent lessthan the northern states during the 1980s, they spent more than thenorthern states post-1991, presumably implying a greater level and quality of public services. We thus find that while the southern states had an edge with regard to the initial conditions of several factors that we have taken into account, it did not have aninitial advantage in all of them (police firing (when AP is included), the stock ofgraduates and the proportion of population in the working age group in which thesouth and the north started off at the same point in 1961). A surprising finding is also that, while the southern states ' average weighted per capita NSDP was nearly twice that of the northern states in 2004, the growth rate of weighted per capita income was on average higher in the northern states (2.2 per cent) than that in the south (which was 1.78 per cent) during the period from1960 to 1991. However, during 1992 to 2004, the average growth rate of weightedper capita NSDP in the southern states was 4.6 per cent compared with only 1.62 percent in the northern states. This shows that the surge in the south is indeed a recent,post-1991 phenomenon. For an explanation of the intriguing phenomenon of the sudden growth of southern states in the 1990s, we turn to major policy changes that were occurring in the Indian economy since the mid-1980s, when the first steps towards decontrol andliberalization occurred in India (see Joshi and Little, 1997; Rodrik and Subramanian,Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 432005). This is also consistent with what the earlier literature (for example, Mathur, 2001; Basu, 2004) finds. De-licensing of industries and more liberal policies towardsforeign investment were adopted during this period. In 1991, the full-fledgedeconomic liberalization further enabled the opening up of the Indian economy, whichcreated favourable conditions for private sector investment, both domestic andforeign. These policy changes were exogenous and national, with all the states being free to take advantage of the opportunities it offered. So states that were more prepared (in terms of governance and infrastructure) to take the plunge forwardsucceeded, whereas the states that were less prepared in these terms could not doso. Ahluwalia (2000) also highlights how the economic liberalization reduced thedegree of control exercised by the centre in many areas, leaving much greater scopefor state-level initiatives, which is particularly true as far as attracting investment, both domestic and foreign, is concerned. Ahluwalia concludes that state-level performance and policies therefore deserve much closer attention than they receive.It is particularly important to study the differences in performance among states inorder to extract lessons about what works and what does not. A betterunderstanding of the reasons for the superior performance of some states would helpto spread success from one part of the country to another. Overall, the upward shift in per capita income, downward trend in poverty reduction and much greater investment flows that occurred in the southern states relative to that in the northern states can be explained partly by the advantage the former had in terms of human capabilities, infrastructure, urbanization and some(not all) law and order indicators and partly by the economic liberalization of 1991.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 44DATA APPENDIX Data on investments are from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data set CAPEX.

The country has now set its sights establishing universal health insurance coverage by 2015. This articleaims to, first, describe the current health-care system in Viet Namaccompanied by a number of challenges the country faces in deliveringand financing health-related services, and then provides some policydiscussions on how to achieve this ambitious plan. The article also stresses the important role in attaining universal health insurance coverage by providing quality services and guaranteeing financialprotection for both health-care suppliers and consumers. JEL classification code: I14, I18. Key words : Health-care system, universal health insurance, Viet Nam. I. INTRODUCTION The implementation of the Doi Moi (renovation) programmes about 20 year ago has transformed Viet Nam from being one of the poorest countries in the world in the late 1980s to a low middle-income country since 2008. The average grossdomestic product (GDP) growth rate was about 7.4 per cent during 1991 to 2010, andthis, in turn, has helped boost GDP per capita from $98 in 1990 to $1,170 in 2010.Also, thanks to this remarkable economic growth, the national poverty rate decreasedsignificantly from 58.1 per cent in 1993 to about 9.5 per cent in 2010. Along with * Giang Thanh Long, Ph.D., National Economics University (NEU) and Indochina Research and Consulting (IRC), Hanoi, Viet Nam, longgt@neu.edu.vn.

The author is also thankful to two anonymous referees of the Journal for their insightful comments and suggestions, which in turn helped to improve the article.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 48these remarkable social and economic achievements, great strides have been made in the country 's health sector, in which the health outcomes are similar to those of high-middle income and advanced countries in many aspects. The Vietnamese nowenjoy a healthier and longer life, which, in turn, has lifted the country into the ranks ofmedium human development countries, placing 113 out of 169 countries in the worldin 2010 (UNDP , 2010). The Government recently announced its plan to achieve universal health insurance coverage by 2015. This plan entails: strengthening the health-care system, extending delivery of health-care services to all people andimproving the quality and contents of health-care packages offered by both publicand private health providers to insured beneficiaries. By 2010, health insurancecoverage had reached 62 per cent of the total population or about 53 million persons.Under current regulations, the compulsory health insurance scheme covers people working in the formal sector, as well as specific groups of the population (including the poor, children under six years of age and veterans). As indicated in the HealthInsurance Law enacted on 1 January 2007, coverage will be gradually expanded tothe rest of the population until universal coverage is reached: first to all students,then to the \"near-poor \" (who are not poor, but his/her household per capita expenditure is less than 125% poverty line), and finally to all workers in the informal sector. This is expected to be completed by 2015. Several challenging issues must be dealt with in the transition towards a universal health insurance system, including the delivery and financing of health- care services. With regard to delivery, achieving such an ambitious policy goal will largely depend on the ability to extend the existing voluntary health insurance scheme topeople working in the informal sector. In other words, making health insurancecompulsory for all Vietnamese. Notably, in the past years, few of the people workingin the informal sector have voluntarily joined the health insurance system, and based on this alone, reaching the goal of universal health insurance coverage by 2015 will require a change in mindset among informal workers and non-working familymembers towards health insurance. In addition, achieving universal health insurance coverage will also require dealing with financing issue. By 2008, health insurance revenue represented less than1 per cent of GDP , and health insurance covered only 13 per cent of total healthexpenditure (Viet Nam, 2007). Other financing sources for health expenditure, particularly from public ones, remain stable and low. As such, out-of-pocket (OOP) spending consequently remains high. Increasing public spending on health toencourage participation of informal workers and their dependents will expand thecoverage of health insurance as well as help relieve financial constrains in the longerterm.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 49The main objective of this paper is to describe the current state and challenges of the health-care system in Viet Nam with a special focus on financingand delivery of services through health insurance, and to provide some policysuggestions to deal with issues related to the goal of achieving universal healthinsurance by 2015. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we willprovide an overview on the development of the Vietnamese health-care system, with a discussion on its current state and the challenges in financing and the delivery of services. The third section will provide an analysis of the delivery patterns ofhealth-care services through health insurance. The paper will also discuss financialrequirements for reaching a universal health insurance with simulation results fromLieberman and Wagstaff (2008). The final part will provide concluding remarks. II. HEALTH-CARE PERFORMANCE, SERVICES DELIVERY AND FINANCING IN VIET NAM The health sector has received special attention from the Government, in particular the Ministry of Health (MOH), which has instituted a number of policies,guidelines, and regulations to strengthen the health system and improve the health ofthe Vietnamese people. This section briefly presents several main health policies which aim to deliver efficient and financially viable health care services. Performance of health sector and challenges Among the eight Millennium Development Goals, three are related to basic health indicators, including reduction of child mortality; improvement of maternalhealth, and tackling of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. As assessed bya number of studies, such as Adams (2005) and WHO (2009), Viet Nam has achieved certain successes along the pathway towards the Goals. Viet Nam has achieved most of the Goals during the period 2006 to 2010. For instance, in 2009, the maternalmortality rate (MMR) reached 75 per 100,000 live births in comparison with 233 per100,000 live births in 1990; under-five child malnutrition rate was 20.6 per cent, whichis close to the target of 20 per cent by 2010; and under-five mortality (U5MR) andinfant mortality rate (IMR) per 1,000 live births reached 25 and 15, respectively, attaining the targets of 25 and 16, respectively, by 2010 (figure 1).Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 50Viet Nam has also done well in terms of child mortality, in which there has been a rapid reduction in comparison with Malaysia and Thailand - two Asian countries with significantly higher per capita incomes than Viet Nam. Unlike Thailand,which saw rising age-specific mortality rates at some ages between 2000 and 2005,and Malaysia, where the decline in age-specific mortality appeared to have stagnated,Figure 1.

Trends in age-adjusted mortality: Viet Nam, Malaysia and Thailand Source : WHO Life Tables for Member States, as quoted by Lieberman and Wagstaff (2008). Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 51Viet Nam saw reductions in age-specific mortality at all ages between 2000 and 2005. Also, Viet Nam 's age-specific death rates compared favourably with those of Malaysia across the full range of ages (figure 2). In accordance with a number of other studies,Lieberman and Wagstaff (2008) show that such impressive achievements in the healthsector are results of a widely-covered grass-roots health system in Viet Nam focusingon various preventive health-care services. However, a number of critical challenges need to be responded to if Viet Nam is to continue its above-mentioned achievements. First, there are wide gaps and notable variations in IMR by region. For instance, in the three regions with the highestIMRs, an infant has a probability of dying before reaching his or her first birthdayabout two and a half times higher than an infant in the three regions with the lowestIMRs (figure 3). Particularly high IMR has been observed in certain provinces. In theperiod 2005 to 2008, the highest IMR incidence was in Kontum (62.6 per cent in 2005; 48 per cent in 2008); Ha Giang (55.8 per cent and 40.0 per cent, respectively); Lai Chau (44.0 per cent and 33.0 per cent, respectively). These provinces experienced anIMR of about 5 to 6 times as much as developed provinces, such as Hanoi (7.9 percent and 7.0 per cent, respectively) and about 2 to 3 times as much as the nationalaverage (17.8 per cent and 15.0 per cent, respectively). Such a disparity could beexplained in large part by differences in the level of development among the regions insuch factors as income, education, infrastructure and availability of services. Figure 3. Regional differences in IMR Source : Hayes and others (2009).40 30 20 10 0 2002 2003 2004 2005Northwest Central Highlands Northeast North Central Central Coast Mekong River Delta Red River Delta SoutheastAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 52Significant differences in IMR have also been observed between income groups and rural and urban areas. The gaps in IMR between the poorest and richestgroups, and between rural and urban areas have widened (figure 4). This situationindicates that persons from rural areas and with low incomes will have difficulty inovercoming the high incidence of IMR, which in turn, will have a negative impact ontheir human development. Figure 4. Differences in IMR between income groups and rural and urban areas Source : UNICEF (2008). Second, another great challenge is that the structure of causes of death has also changed (figure 5). The population is going through a so-called \"epidemiological transition \", with communicable infectious diseases being replaced by non- communicable chronic degenerative illnesses as the major causes of death. In 1976and 1986, the communicable diseases still accounted for more than 50 per cent ofsuch deaths, but by 2000 they accounted for less than 30 per cent of such deaths, and today the figure is less than 20 per cent. At the same time, the non- communicable diseases rose from less than 50 per cent to about 60 per cent of thesedeaths. A striking increase in accidents, injuries and poisoning are some of theincreasing important issues concerning illness and death in Viet Nam today. AsHayes and others (2009) argued, such changes are due to swift socio-economicchanges, which result in lifestyle-related causes of death. Services delivery and challenges The health-care network has wide coverage, in which most communes have health care stations. In terms of human resources providing health care, healthworkers are available in all communes and wards. In 2008, 65 per cent of communes100 80 60 40 20 0 1993 2006Poorest Near-poor Middle Near-rich Richest7184 5956 56 4652 42 40 16% 36% 4% 9% Urban RuralAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 53had doctors, and 87 per cent of villages had health workers or staff. The number of public health establishments has increased over time. During the period 2000 to2008, the number of public hospitals increased from 835 to 974, and the number ofcommune health centres increased from 10,271 to 10,917 (figure 6). The number of doctors and nurses in public medical hospitals and stations also increased significantly. Figure 7 shows that the number of doctors and nurses increased byabout 46 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, during the period 2000 to 2008. Thegrowth rate of medical staff was much higher than the growth rate of the population.As a result, the average number of doctors and nurses per 100,000 people increasedremarkably between 2000 and 2008 (figure 7). However, there are a number of challenges that the Vietnamese health-care system has been facing in terms of delivery. First, there is a variation in the number of public health establishments and medical staff across regions (table 1).Figure 5.

Similar trends are also found at the provincial level (Nguyen, 2010). This reflects various pressures on delivery of health-care services in regions and provinces with high population density in terms of providing adequate and qualitycare to people. Another issue related to the availability of health-care services is the concentration of health centres where people can go for treatment. As shown in thereport by the Ministry of Health and Health Partnership Group (Viet Nam, 2007), dueto the low quality of health care at communal health centres, people usually choose to go to district and provincial hospitals for better treatment. This, in turn, creates overcrowding in these types of hospitals. In addition, as few communes are locatednear district and provincial hospitals, people have to travel long distances to thenearest hospital. Using data from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Survey(VHLSS) 2008, Nguyen (2010) estimates that the average distance from communecentres to the closest district hospital in the rural areas is 13.3 km, 22.5 km and 15.6 km for North-East, North-West and Central Highlands, respectively. The distance to the provincial hospital is much longer, about 39.3 km. Travelling such along way might be a factor preventing people living in disadvantaged areas to getTable 1.

As such, improving the quality of care at communal health-care centres is critical to increase people 's utilization and access to good health-care services. Second, biases in inpatient admissions and outpatient visits remain persistent over time. Hospitals increased the number of outpatient visits andinpatient admissions by an average of 5 per cent annually (figure 8), but communalhealth centres tended to reduce the inpatient admissions. Nevertheless, in the same period, communal health centres experienced a dramatic increase in outpatient visits, at an average of 13 per cent growth per year. In comparison with developedcountries, inpatient admission rate in Viet Nam is not much different, but its outpatientvisit rate is much lower. This implies that the current health-care system in Viet Namis heavily biased towards inpatient care, and this is due to the poorly developedprimary care system. Figure 8. Inpatient admissions and outpatient visits, 1998-2006 Source : Viet Nam, Ministry of Health (various years), as quoted in Lieberman and Wagstaff (2008). Analysing both inpatient admissions and outpatient visits by various population groups also helps to provide more understanding of the accessibility ofpeople to health-care services. The access to health care services is reflected byhealth care visits (table 2). Table 2 presents the percentage of people using inpatientand outpatient services in different types of health care centres in 2008. It shows that051015202530 1998 2000 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 1998 2000 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Inpatient OutpatientAdmissions/visits (millions) 0.000.050.100.150.200.250.30 Consultation rate per personCHCs Hospitals and polyclinics Consultation rateAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 57older persons visit medical establishments for both inpatient and outpatient care more frequently than do younger persons. Females tend to have more visits to healthcentres for outpatient care than do males, but this is converse for the case ofinpatient care. Also, people in disadvantaged groups maintain lower utilization ratesfor both inpatient and outpatient care than do other groups. In particular, the poor,ethnic minorities and people living in mountainous regions use inpatient and outpatient care services less frequently than other groups of people. Table 2.

However,figure 9 shows low accessibility for more vulnerable groups even if they are healthinsurance holders. Caution should also be applied in interpreting the outpatienthospital visits of the voluntary insured, because majority of them (which are studentsand pupils) never received reimbursements for the treatments (Giang, 2007). As shown, however, the hospital visits and admissions are disproportionate among health insurance participant groups. Although the number of hospital visits(outpatient) of the poor has increased over time, the poor made 60 per cent fewerhospital visits than other mandatory participants. In terms of inpatient hospital use,the poor used 65 per cent less than other mandatory participants. In addition,rural-urban migrants are also unlikely to be covered and able to access health services, as World Bank (2007) shows that 87 per cent of migrants, who were sick and treated at health facilities, had to pay for the cost of services and medications outof their pockets; only 12 per cent had the cost covered by their families; and none ofthem had health insurance. Such a significantly lower hospital utilization rate forthese groups is due to the financial cost and other difficulties in reaching hospitals interms of distance and transportation, as well as distrust and other attitudes of the Figure 9.

A report by the United Nations (2003) indicates that hospital service providers seem to discriminate against people whose fees arewaived and those with free insurance cards, and even sometimes also against thosewho hold insurance cards. Financing and challenges According to the Ministry of Health and the Health Partnership Group (Viet Nam, 2007), public expenditures on health care include two basic financing schemes, i.e. (a) direct subsidies from the government budget to service providers;and (b) payments through health insurance. In detail, payments from the governmentbudget are deducted from the government revenues, while health insurance revenueis mostly from contributions by employees and employers. The budget funds areusually planned on an annual basis through various review processes and then given directly to service providers through the Ministry of Health. Furthermore, the central health-care budget goes to the central level of the health system, while thesubnational budget goes to provincial and lower-level health system. Most capitalinvestment costs and a part of recurrent costs, particularly for the salaries of healthworkers in the public health care centres, are covered by the government budget.Health insurance revenues, meanwhile, are managed by the Viet Nam Social Security (VSS). Figure 10 describes the health-care financial flows in Viet Nam. Since 2005, in accordance with Decree 63, a part of the annual government budget has been allocated to VSS as a health insurance premium for the poor andunder-six children. Similarly, the Government also subsidizes health insurancepremiums for other population groups, including national merits. As such, socialinsurance revenues include contributions from employers and employees as well assubsidies from the government budget. The Government also provides subsidies for near-poor groups. In addition to the government budget and health insurance, private payments, especially out-of-pocket payments (OOP), are also a key component ofhealth financing. In 2008, Viet Nam 's total health expenditures accounted for 6.5 per cent of GDP with an average expenditure per capita of $46. These figures were fairly highin comparison with the average total and per capita expenditure of the countries inthe region, pegged at 3.4 per cent and $31, respectively. For the whole country, per capita expenditure on health increases from VND 504,000 in 2004 to VND 604,000 in 2008, and health expenditure accounted for 6.5 per cent and 6.8 per cent of thetotal household expenditure in 2004 and 2008, respectively (Nguyen, 2010). The proportion of public financing (government budget and health insurance) out of total expenditure for health is lower than other countries in the regionAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 60(29 per cent compared to 34 per cent in 2008), and as a result, more than 70 per cent of health expenditures were from out-of-pocket payments. This number was reduced slowly from more than 80 per cent in 1998 and 75 per cent in 2005 (figure 11). Exploring further OOP , data from VHLSS 2008 show that OOP (including expenditures for treatment fees, drugs, cost for travel, meal and accommodation) isunfavourable to the poor, rural people, ethnic minorities and people living inmountainous regions as regards inpatient services, while it is more \"favourable \" to these same groups for outpatient services (table 3). As explained by Nguyen (2010),Figure 10.

Although the government has increased its spending for health care in recent years, it has been noted that Viet Nam is below regional standards in terms of the degree to which government health spending reaches the poor (figure 12). This is due to the fact that most general government spending on health has still been onsupply-side subsidies, with health insurance accounting for a mere 13 per cent oftotal health spending as of 2008. The supply-side subsidies are absorbed mostly byurban hospitals, while health insurance enrolments and outlays are highest among thebetter-off (Lieberman and Wagstaff, 2008). In order to fully attain universal health insurance by 2015, a number of policies and programmes on health insurance have been implemented. The issuance of the Health Insurance Law in 2007, particularly, has created an important legalcorridor for realizing the policy on health insurance.Figure 11.

There are two subschemes in the social health insurance system of Viet Nam: the mandatory scheme and the voluntary scheme. Health insurance regulations, issued on 15 August 1992, provide mandatory health insurance for employees in enterprises, socio-economic organizations, civil servants, pensioners, early retireesdue to loss of workability, and national devotees. The Government of Viet Nam hascontinuously included specific target groups in response to their needs. In 2005, forexample, all children under six years old became eligible for free health care in publicAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 63Figure 12. Who benefits from government health spending in Viet Nam? Source :O 'Donnell and others (2007), as quoted by Lieberman and Wagstaff (2008). health facilities. As such, the mandatory social health insurance scheme in Viet Nam currently includes three different programmes: (a) employment-based programme;(b) health-care funds for the poor; and (c) free health insurance programme for under- six children. Table 4 summarizes the Vietnamese social health insurance system by subschemes, programmes, ratios, target groups and contribution levels. Table 5 shows the numbers and ratios of the insured people in both mandatory and voluntary health insurance schemes. The covered groups includeformal sector employees, the poor, the elderly, students and children under six yearsof age. The number of individuals insured through the voluntary scheme remains low.Most of the current insured participants in the voluntary scheme are schoolchildren who are strongly encouraged to purchase insurance by school authorities (Giang, 2007). There have been a number of reasons for such a low coverage, including lowincome, poor quality of public health services, poor marketing of the scheme,contribution levels and payment inflexibility, and aversion to collective Stateapproaches (Cha, 2009). In terms of financing, the mandatory health insurancesystem is financed by 2 per cent of employers ' and 1 per cent of employees ' contributions. In addition to the employed, other population groups (retirees, the disabled and meritorious people) also have a contribution rate of 3 per cent either outof their pensions or the minimum government subsidies in the case of those receivingsocial benefits.

The limited number of employed persons participating in thescheme results in limited revenue, which in turn requires an increasing governmentresponsibility to maintain the balance in health-care financing. Table 6 presents the general collection and spending of social health insurance during the period 2003 to 2008. The debt accumulated since the healthinsurance system started is due to the lack of people contributing to the system, a fixed contribution rate of 3 per cent since 1992, and difficulties in collecting contributions. The major deficits occur in the free health care for the children undersix and the voluntary health insurance fund. There are four main reasons for thedeficit: (a) relatively low health insurance fees; (b) frequent hospital use; (c) abuse ofthe system by both providers and patients; and (d) inclusive health-care packages.Cha (2009) provides careful analysis of these reasons. First, the current health-care system is proven to be already burdensome to the poor. Therefore, increasing the contribution level and/or the co-payment is an unlikely solution for this problem and isagainst the purpose of implementing pro-poor health policies. Second, the majorityof the population group, young children, in the voluntary health insurance scheme areusually the most frequent hospital users, except for the elderly. This means that thevoluntary health insurance is under a great deficit because it mainly covers a targetgroup that is prone to illness and hospital use. However, children are obviously an important population from a policy and economic perspective and cannot be disregarded by the health insurance system. Third, some health experts expressedconcern about the possible abuse of the health insurance card. However, relativelylow rates of hospital use suggest that the abuse of health insurance card by patientsrarely happens; the average number of hospital visits per health insurance card wasonly about two times a year in 2008. Lastly, providing an inclusive health-care package is an ongoing effort by the Government of Viet Nam to protect the poor and the near poor from the financial shocks associated with severe illness. Healthinsurance experts note the hefty challenge of maintaining equilibrium betweenimproving services to satisfactory levels while managing a sustainable healthinsurance fund. Furthermore, there are great regional inequalities, horizontal andvertical, in the allocation of the State budget for health insurance. As regards universal health insurance coverage, the issue of most concern is the financial viability of such a scheme, and how to finance it. As suggested by Lieberman and Wagstaff (2008), it would be radical to implement such a scheme bymixing contributions (paid by formal-sector workers) and the government budget(for the others). As the coverage is expanded to the entire population, both revenuesand outlays for the health insurance scheme will increase. Table 7 shows the resultsfrom a simulation model by Lieberman and Wagstaff (2008) using data from VHLSSAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 662006, in which they assume that those who are currently uninsured have the same inpatient admission and outpatient visit rates as those who are currently insured, andthat VSS will spend the same amount per contact for the newly insured as it spendson those currently insured. The results show that expanding coverage to the entire population would raise health insurance outlays from VND 5,804 billion to VND 12,102 billion (or from VND 70,000 per capita to VND 147,000 per capita, an increase of VND77,000 per capita). On the assumption that general revenues would be used tofinance coverage of all those not currently enrolled with VSS and all those voluntarilyenrolled with VSS, but with contributions remaining at their existing level for formal-sector workers, general government spending on health (including VSS contributions) would rise by a total of VND 76,000 per capita, or VND 6.3 trillion in aggregate. These changes would raise general government expenditure on health as a share of GDPfrom 1.5 per cent to 2.2 per cent. If this extra spending were financed entirely throughadditional borrowing, Viet Nam 's fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP would increase from 3.8 per cent to 4.4 per cent in 2006. One good prospect from this simulationis that the total OOP spending on health care would fall from VND 29,901 billion (67 per cent of total health expenditure) to VND 26,664 billion (56 per cent of total expenditure) - a reduction of VND 3.2 trillion, equivalent to a fall of 11 percentage points.Table 6.

POLICY DISCUSSION In order to attain universal health insurance coverage and provide the people with increased accessibility to health-care services, apart from dealing with variousissues related to the health status of the people, Viet Nam needs to transform the current health insurance scheme. In that regard, there are three key issues for policy consideration: efficiency (financial sustainability); effectiveness (access to and qualityof care); and equity (health-care status, fair financing, and risk protection).Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 69First, financial sustainability refers mainly to the long-term ability and potential to generate sufficient resources to support health while containing costs.The current scheme has faced significant financial challenges. There will be a rangeof possible responses, including further government subsidies, a reduction inreimbursable services, and changes to the provider payment mechanism. However,considering the financial burden already imposed on patients coupled with the recent increase in the contribution rate from 3 per cent to 4.5 per cent (effective from 1 January 2010 in accordance with Decree 62), any possibility of a reduction inreimbursable services should be ruled out. Second, with a view to reaching financial sustainability, policymakers should reduce supplier-induced costs by encouraging providers to use a paymentmechanism, which can share risks and rewards, and a monitoring mechanism tocontrol under-utilization of services. Equally important, policymakers also need to reduce consumer-induced costs by allowing consumer cost-sharing through deductibles and co-payments but having unlimited access to services with adequatefinancial protection. A recent study by Sepehri and others (2010) shows that accessto insurance benefits is constrained by the recent health-care reform initiatives,allowing public hospitals to establish wards for private fee-paying patients andprovide them with better quality care - including on-demand services, such as choice of doctor, choice of room, and choice of scanning technology - than is normally available in regular hospital areas. In other words, financial sustainability should be emphasized from both the supply of and the demand for health-care services. Third, improvement of service delivery. An effective health system provides timely access to the full array of needed services, together with efficacious and safecare leading to improvement in health, continuity of care, and respect. To enhanceaccessibility to care and quality of care, Viet Nam needs, firstly, to ensure theavailability of health care by (a) increasing the number of physicians, nurses and hospitals in all regions/provinces, and (b) requiring all private health-care providers to join the social health insurance system. As such, patients can choose any health-careservice provider, whether they are private or public. In addition, it is urgently neededto monitor the quality of care through appropriate prescription guidelines, treatmentcompletion rates, readmission rates, the rate of avoidable hospitalizations, and therate of follow-up visits, among other things. Fourth, equity should be promoted by improving resource mobilization and allocation to the extent that favours the poor and other vulnerable groups. To reach equity, private health insurance should not be widely encouraged; rather, privatehealth insurance can be supplementary to the mandatory health insurance scheme inorder to reach the entire population. In addition to this initial policy direction,Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 70policymakers should also pay attention to: (a) minimizing adverse selection and encouraging broader risk pooling by mandating insurance to all, encouragingcollective enrolments, and creating incentives for low-risk individuals to join theinsurance pool; (b) minimizing risk selection along with broader risk pooling;(c) ensuring financial stability with sufficient minimum capital and reserverequirements; and (d) ensuring that insurance packages provide adequate financial protection by defining a universal package for all people along with specific packages that meet demand. Lastly, delivery and financing of health-care services will not be efficiently implemented without good institutional arrangements for the health-care system asa whole. To have a universal health-care system, in which every citizen can accessthe needed health-care services, the key policy action is to boost the quality ofservices coverage at the commune and district levels. This action will also be highly appropriate from equitable perspectives. Investment in grass-roots provincial health centres will be pro-poor, since the poor use communal health centres (CHCs) anddistrict hospital services more heavily than their share in the population suggests, inlarge part because those who are better-off typically gravitate towards higher qualityproviders in district, provincial, and central level hospitals. The poor, who stand togain most from reductions in mortality rates from preventable causes, also benefitdisproportionately from the improved operation of CHCs as the primary bases from which preventive health services are delivered. As argued by Fritzen (2007), there should be two types of policy interventions that need to be given heightened priorityby health planners - delivery and financing health-care services, with special attention to equity. The first one is focused on improvements to the institutional environmentunderpinning CHC performance, in which the most important actions are tounderstand the set of pressures and incentives felt by CHC personnel (such as a low compensation rate along with high responsibility in providing services) and to identify appropriate mechanisms for increasing the pressure for responsive CHC performancewhile ensuring an adequate flow of resources to them for meeting minimumstandards. The second one pays greater attention to the demand side ofinterventions underpinning health quality and access, i.e., interventions aiming toincrease basic health knowledge and to influence the demand of individuals for basic services. In addition, the issue of how to protect and further develop the quality of preventive service activities should also be urgently considered. These services willremain essential functions for all CHCs to perform. Seeking to build and maintain allCHCs to more or less the same specifications arguably starves resources that can betargeted to preventive health functions that are probably under-funded relative to theirsocial value. In fact, under the current CHC financing mechanisms, the quality ofAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 71preventive services is partly dependent in many CHCs on their success in increasing utilization rates. IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS In this paper, we showed that, in order to reach universal health insurance coverage by 2015, Viet Nam needs to deal with a number of policy issues in itshealth-care system. Particular focus should be on accessibility and quality ofhealth-care services for more vulnerable groups, i.e., rural, low-income, and ethnicminority people since they usually have lower capacity to access quality health-care services than their better-off counterparts. In addition, as Viet Nam has a high incidence of catastrophic household health spending, which in turn further limitspeople 's access to health-care services, the role of government in addressing the financial challenges in health care, particularly for the more vulnerable groups ofpeople, is important. Increasing public spending on health care and improving thequality and delivery of services are among the key policies that need to be implemented to reach efficiency, effectiveness, and equity.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 72REFERENCES Adams, S.J.

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PHILIPPINES George Manzano and Myrene Bedano* This paper develops a modality of liberalization for APEC, based on a sectoral level, as an alternative to the Free Trade Area of theAsia-Pacific (FTAAP). This model, originally developed by Wonnacott(1994), argues for the liberalization, on a Most Favoured Nation (MFN) basis, of sectors where APEC members are principal suppliers. The main advantage of this option is that it skirts the free rider problem that usuallyafflicts MFN liberalization. While this approach would benefit APEC asa group, it impacts different members differently. The paper examines theimplications of such a liberalization modality in APEC on the a (APEC), Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization (EVSL), Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), \"principal supplier \" approach, sectoral liberalization, trade liberalization. I. INTRODUCTION The concept of open regionalism is a fuzzy one. As echoed by Bergsten (1997), this concept was first understood as a concerted unilateral liberalization. * George Manzano is an Assistant Professor at the School of Economics, University of Asia and the Pacific (UA&P), Philippines and Myrene Beda\u00f1o is a Trade and Industry Development Specialist, Bureau ofInternational Trade Relations, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Philippines.

As most of Asia grappled with thecrippling effects of the crisis, the political support for trade liberalization across APECfaltered or at least failed to match the rhetoric of the leaders ' declarations. In addition, as the Doha Round bogged down amid disagreements on agriculture trade,regional trade agreements (RTAs) proliferated. Even within APEC, a multitude of RTAs bloomed, threatening to overshadow APEC 's role as a driver of trade. In an effort to put the APEC profile back to its prominence, the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific(FTAAP) was proposed in 2004. However, given the current trade tensions amongsome members, the political support for such an agreement has becomequestionable. Yet, there remains the imperative for fresh initiatives to keep the bicycleof trade liberalization moving. Given this backdrop, this paper presents another modality to support APEC 's trade liberalization pillar and to provide an alternative to the FTAAP proposal. This paper develops a modality based on sectoral liberalization, reminiscent of the Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization (EVSL). However, in contrast to theill-fated EVSL, where the \"voluntary \" nomination of sectors for early liberalization is based, to some extent, on the mercantilist interests of individual members, theproposed modality will employ a more analytical method for identifying the sector tobe slated for liberalization. Central to this modality is the basis for selection of sectors to be liberalized. Following Wonnacott 's (1994) methodology, the paper will use the \"principal supplier \" criterion in identifying the sectors that can be considered for MFN liberalization. To highlight the implications of the sectoral liberalization onindividual members, a case study of the Philippines will be conducted. II. TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN APEC AND THE FTAAP There are concerns that APEC will miss the Bogor goals, launched in 1994. One initiative to push for the Bogor goals is via the preferential route, i.e., creating a massive RTA encompassing all APEC members. The proposed RTA, dubbed as the FTAAP , represents a significant departure from APEC 's initial approach to trade liberalization. APEC distinguishes itself from conventional preferential models with itsstrict adherence to \"open regionalism \". Specifically, the organization subscribes to the \"concerted unilateralism \" approach that entails the simultaneous unilateral action on the part of APEC members to liberalize trading regimes in a less discriminatory manner. This unique character of APEC seeks to ensure that it will serve as a \"building block \" to global trade liberalization, rather than a \"stumbling block \". Clearly, an RTA would involve a complete overhaul of the APEC modality to tradeliberalization - from a non-discriminatory approach to trade liberalization underpinnedAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 75by voluntary and non-binding commitments, towards an explicit preferential arrangement established through negotiations of reciprocal trade concessions thatare legally binding. The interest in the APEC RTA concept is motivated by a set of reinforcing factors. As mentioned earlier, the primary motive emanates from the challenge forAPEC to revitalize its faltering trade agenda. Critics point to the demise of the EVSLscheme and the ineffectiveness of the Individual Action Plan (IAP) process as the drag on APEC 's credibility and momentum. The failure of the EVSL in the late 1990s revealed that the mechanisms by which the organization operates, whilewell-received, are practicably flawed. Further, the experience demonstrated thatsignificant trade liberalization may not be easily achieved by the mere reliance onvoluntary action by members kept in check only by friendly reminders by peer groups.Thus, the FTAAP is considered to be an effective way to energize APEC and to get it right back on the trade liberalization track. A single RTA that would meld the multitude of RTAs in the region and rationalize the different provisions contained inthese arrangements could well be the solution to the \"spaghetti bowl \" or \"noodle bowl \" effect of overlapping RTAs. In addition, the FTAAP is a response to the gridlocked WTO negotiations. While the FTAAP possesses certain merits there are serious questions about its feasibility in the foreseeable future. One difficulty pertains to the plethora ofinterests and sensitive political dynamics among major players, which makes it difficult to peddle the FTAAP (Morrison, 2007; Aggarwal, 2007). There are also a number of practical difficulties in negotiating such a large-scale arrangement, whichcould dampen the expectations of a successful conclusion in the near future.Designing, negotiating and implementing RTAs consume significant policymaking andcapital resources and the capacity to take part in the RTA is not symmetric amongAPEC members. More recently however, another modality that involves widening the membership of the Trans-Pacific Economic Partnership Agreement (TPP) to potentially include most APEC members has been proposed. All original members ofthe TPP are APEC members and there is active interest among other APEC membersto join. 1 Because the scope for liberalization in the TPP agreement is comprehensive, an expansion of members to include all APEC members could then be a substitute tothe formation of the FTAAP . 1Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore, the four original members, signed the TPP in 2005 which entered into force in May 2006. The United States of America, Australia, Peru and Viet Namexpressed interest in joining the TPP .Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 76In view of these issues revolving around the FTAAP and the gridlock on the multilateral forums, the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), the search of a suitablealternative for trade liberalization agenda in the APEC looms large. Certainly,unilateral liberalization, liberally interpreted as open regionalism, is one. While theeconomic arguments for this modality are many, a negative feature is that it wouldamount to giving the rest of the world a \"free ride \" as non-members automatically benefit from the tariff reductions by APEC members without making corresponding liberalization measures. Another avenue is sectoral liberalization. III. PRINCIPAL SUPPLIER APPROACH TO SECTORAL LIBERALIZATION Theoretical Foundations To the knowledge of the authors, there is no paper in the literature that specifically provides a theoretical justification for sectoral liberalization on an MFNbasis, along the \"principal supplier \" criteria in Wonnacott (1994). There is a related literature that explains the merits of a non-preferential trading club, which is one interpretation of \"open regionalism \". Raimondos-Moller and Woodland (2006) wrote the first paper that discussed the theoretical foundation of the advantages of \"open regionalism \". One variant of \"open regionalism \" is the non-preferential club which is a group of countries that agree to coordinate their non-discriminatory tariff policies and to undertake internalincome transfers. They argue that a non-preferential trading club, by undertakingcoordinated tariff reforms, can improve the efficiency of the resource allocationand welfare of the members of the club, at the same time leave the welfare of the non-members untouched, i.e. a Pareto-improvement. An important feature though is that the \"coordinated tariff reforms \" of the club members requires some members to raise their tariffs and some to reduce theirs or even allow subsidies. They argue thata non-preferential club is consistent with the spirit of the WTO in that whateverarrangements members make to improve their welfare, does not harm the welfare ofthe rest of the world. 2 The sectoral liberalization modality proposed in this paper, share many characteristics of a non-preferential trading club. First, the liberalization, being undertaken on an MFN basis, is non-discriminatory. Second, it is to be undertaken bya subset of the global economy, in this case, APEC members. Third, it should not 2This outcome is similar to Kemp-Wan (1976) proposition except that the latter pertains to customs unions.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 77make the rest of the world worse-off, by keeping the relative prices to non-members unchanged despite the internal changes among club members. Obviously, worldprices would not be held constant in the process of the APEC sectoral liberalization,as the APEC members are dominant producers and consumers in the aforementionedsectors. However, one may argue that because the tariff movements of theAPEC members are, of course, downwards, and granted on an MFN basis, the non- members will not likely be harmed. The \"Principal Supplier \" criteria To lessen the possibility of outsiders free riding 3 on the trade liberalization efforts by APEC, the challenge is to identify those areas in which the benefits of tradeliberalization would redound mostly on APEC members than on non-members. Earlierwork that addressed the issue of free riding is by Wonnacott (1994) that suggested a trade liberalization scheme on a selective product-by-product basis wherein countries choose the commodities for early liberalization based on a pre-definedcriteria. Specifically, the methodology by Wonnacott prescribes that, in order tominimize the free rider problem, tariff reduction should be undertaken on the goodswhere APEC is a dominant global supplier. Intuitively, the benefits of tariff reductions,in terms of enhanced market access, on these goods would largely accrue to APEC members, simply, because non-APEC members are not major exporters of such products. In the selection of potential candidates for liberalization, the share of APEC in the world exports of goods was used as basis. A large percentage share of exports istaken to indicate that \"free riding \" by non-members would be less problematic. As in Wonnacott 's study, the export shares of APEC in total world trade are compared with their share in total world exports less intra-European Union trade. Trade between European Union member countries is discounted, as stipulated in Wonnacott (1994) on the ground that it is becoming more and more intraregional. For this exercise,commodities are examined at the 6-digit level based on the Harmonized System (HS)Commodity Classification Code. The products in which the APEC members are principal suppliers are reported in table 1. These are the products where APEC members, as a whole, enjoya share of at least 70 per cent of world exports in 2005 (not counting intra-European Union trade). 3Free riding is considered a cost because third countries will enjoy market acess without giving 'quid- pro-quo' concessions on access to their own markets.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 78The list in table 1 and annex A, which contains 282 commodities, is quite varied, reflecting the wide range of products where individual APEC members havecomparative advantage.

Note : The complete list is reported in annex A.Table 1. (continued) Exports (in USD billion) World Rank HS Code Description less intra- APEC World European Union Trade To analyse the importance of the selected products in the trade of individual APEC members, these products are classified based on their trade shares. Panel A inannex B shows the imports of APEC partners above each cut-off level. The figuresreported in panel A in annex B give a rough approximation of the value of the marketthat would be opened for each APEC member indicated when APEC partners bringdown their tariffs on the items that lie above the chosen cut-off lines. Panels B and CAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 80convey information of the stakes of individual APEC members as it identifies the importance of these products, given by their shares in the export and import trade ofmembers. Panel D provides the difference between the shares in total exports andthose in total imports. Table 2.

Notes : Share in APEC exports = Share of goods in the cut-off level and above in total APEC exports; Share in APEC imports = Share of goods in the cut-off level and above in total APEC imports; Difference in EX-IM shares = Share in APEC exports - Share in APEC imports. Looking at the shares of APEC as a whole in the world exports and world imports of the identified commodities in table 2 indicates that the regional groupinghas clear advantage in the export of these products. For example, the share of the products at the 70 per cent cut-off level in the export of APEC members as a group stands at almost 46 per cent, while the share of these products in the grouping 's imports is much lower, at 38 per cent. On the other hand, products where APECaccounts for 90 per cent of world trade, on the other hand, comprise only about14 per cent of world export and 11 per cent of world import. At every percentagecut-off, the selected products ' shares in exports are much greater than the corresponding share in imports. The implication is that the free riding problem is expected to be small. What could be a suitable benchmark to distinguish a product or sector to be one where APEC is a principal supplier? In the first place, the cut-off level measuredby the share of APEC exports to world exports should be that which maximizes thegap between the share of APEC exports to world exports and its corresponding shareof world imports. The idea is to look for cut-off level where the offensive interest, as proxied by the relative share of APEC exports to world exports, is secured relative to the defensive interests, as represented by the relative share of APEC in world imports.As indicated by the share of APEC as a whole in world exports, 70 per cent may beAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 81a reasonable cut-off level because going this far would cover almost half of APEC exports. Additionally, as table 2 reports, it is at the 70 per cent cut-off level where thediscrepancy between the share of APEC exports and imports is greatest (fourthcolumn). The implication here is that the offensive interest of APEC, as a whole, iswell-served at the benchmark for the \"principal supplier \" at the 70 per cent level. In addition, it appears that there will be much to gain from a negotiation which covers products where APEC members provide 70 per cent or more of world exports. As mentioned earlier, at a cut-off rate of 70 per cent, the percentage of APEC exportscovered is close to 46 per cent which is quite sizeable already. At the same time, theportion of APEC exports covered by a negotiation that only considers the next upperbracket of 75 per cent is only about 35 per cent of APEC exports. As the secondcolumn of table 2 shows, the average coverage of APEC exports that will not be included in the sectoral negotiations is greatest when the cut-off point is raised from 70 per cent to 75 per cent. Specifically, the portion of APEC exports that is notcovered declines by 11.03 per cent, representing an average decrease of 2.21 percent per percentage rise of cut-off between 70 per cent and 75 per cent. For tractability, the selected APEC products were classified by sector. Eleven (11) sectors have been identified for this study - electronics, transport equipments, machineries, metal and metal products, wood and wood-basedproducts, textile and garments, footwear and headgear, agricultural products and raw materials, plastics and rubbers, chemicals, miscellaneous manufactures. The commodity coverage of the sectors of interest is presented in table 3. Table 3.

Many of the developing members of APEC specialize in labour-intensive assembly-type operations. Particularly, APEC 's East Asian members have been playing an increasing role in these supply networks, especially with regard to trade inparts and components of electronic products, indicating their importance ininternational production sharing.Table 4.

However, the discrepancy is very minimal atan average of 2 per cent for all sectors, indicating that while APEC members arestrong suppliers of these goods, they are also strong consumers of such items. 4 IV. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PHILIPPINE TRADE NEGOTIATION STRATEGY: CASE STUDY Earlier, it was argued that the sectoral liberalization based on the \"principal supplier \" approach would be beneficial to APEC as a whole. However, the impact on the individual members would vary as in the case of multilateral and regionalliberalization. What are the implications of the proposed modality of liberalization onthe trade negotiation of the Philippines? More specifically, to what extent does the sectoral liberalization serve its offensive and defensive interests? 5 Based on table 5, for the products in which APEC members provide 70 per cent and more of world exports (less intra-European Union trade), the Philippines ' APEC partners imported $1,915 billion in 2005 from the world. This means thatthe Philippines along with everybody else have improved market access (due tosectoral liberalization) equivalent to the aforementioned value, keeping all otherfactors such as income constant. It could be seen that at the 90 per cent cut-off level, market potential available to the Philippines is significantly reduced by more than two-thirds to $563 billion. As annex B reports, the products where APEC supplies 70 per cent of the world 's exports constitute close to 75 per cent of total Philippine exports in 2005. This indicates that the Philippines is a dominant supplier for the set of products wherethere is relatively little free riding if liberalized unilaterally. Furthermore, the differenceat the 70 per cent and 75 per cent between share of selected products in total exports and imports respectively, are quite substantial. 4A comparison of the 'principal supplier' goods with the products proposed for sectoral liberalization in the WTO Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) in August 2008 is reported in annex D. One notes that65 per cent of goods under the NAMA correspond to the items in the 'principal supplier' goods. Amongthe sectors with the highest incidence of correspondence are: electronics, machineries, wood, andchemicals. Annex D also reports the correspondence of the 'principal supplier' goods with the goodsproposed under the 1998 APEC EVSL. In contrast to the NAMA comparsion, only 45 per cent of the1998 APEC EVSL 'goods' are found in the list of the 'principal supplier' goods indicating that the latterhas a wider scope for liberalization than the EVSL. 5Gaining greater market access for exportables constitutes the 'offensive interest' in trade negotiations in this paper. By 'defensive interest' is meant preventing the erosion of current levels of protection oncertain 'sensitive' sectors.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 84For the Philippines case, however, the optimum cut-off appears to be about 75 per cent, where the difference between export and import shares is greatest. Onemay note as well, that as one increases the cut-off from 75 per cent to 80 per cent,the portion of Philippine exports that are not covered by the sectoral agreement willfall by almost 7 per cent that is equivalent to an average decrease of 1.31 per cent perpercentage point increase between these two aforementioned cut-off levels.Table 5.

Eight of the broad sectors account for less than 1 per cent of total Philippine exports (see table 6). Table 7 reports the MFN tariffs of the Philippine 's APEC partners in the broad sectoral categories for which sectoral liberalization is proposed. To illustrate, theaverage applied MFN tariffs facing Philippine exporters of electronics (or electronicproducts where APEC 's share in the world exports is 70 per cent or greater) in the APEC market is 4.38 per cent. If the proposed sectoral liberalization proceeds, then this figure represents the maximum extent of additional market access made available to the Philippines, i.e. if there is full elimination of tariffs. As such, the average tariffscan be a measure of the offensive interest of an APEC member served by the sectoralliberalization. The larger the prevailing tariffs facing the member in a particular sector,the greater the market access accorded under a sectoral liberalization programme.Note, however, that the tariffs as reported in the table may be overstated because of the overlapping preferential trade agreements currently in place among many APEC members. One limitation of this study is that it does not take into account the currentRTAs of APEC members in computing for the incremental market access due tosectoral liberalization.Footwear and headgear 25 0.08 0.05 0.03 Agricultural goods and raw materials 71 0.09 2.28 -2.19 Plastics and rubbers 87 0.60 1.11 -0.51 Chemicals 40 0.00 0.44 -0.44 Miscellaneous manufactures 58 0.29 0.14 0.15 Source : Authors ' calculations using ITC TradeMap data.

Electronics and machineries have MFN tariffs of only 1.71 per centand 1.40 per cent respectively, indicating that the degree of potential incremental market access may be limited. The potential additional market access in footwear, textile, rubber, and transportation equipment is rather considerable, in view of theTable 7.

However, the volume of Philippine exports in the aforementioned sectors, save transportationequipment, is not very substantial (see table 6). Perhaps the reason for the lowvolume of exports of the Philippines in footwear, textile, etc. to other APECeconomies is due to high tariff barriers. Thus, the existing profile of tariffs facingPhilippine exports also influences the current distribution and volume of exports among the sectors. The defensive interest of the Philippines can partially be gauged from the current levels of tariffs it imposes on the candidate sectors for sectoral liberalization,with emphasis on the prevalence of tariff peaks. Table 8 reports the tariff profile of thePhilippines on the sectors of interest. In many instances, the average tariff levels ofthe Philippines on the products selected on the basis of the principal supplier criterion(referred to as \"selected \" products) are higher than the corresponding average tariffs of its APEC trade partners. As expected, the MFN tariffs on electronics and machineries are quite low indicating that the selected sectors are not \"sensitive \". Interestingly the average tariff of the selected chemical sectors is also quite low. Onthe whole, the average tariff of the selected products for the Philippines is slightlyhigher than the simple average for the whole range of products in the Philippinesindicating that there could be sensitivities in the sample of selected products.Actually, 20 per cent of the tariff lines in the selected products have tariff peaks, defined as tariffs beyond 15 per cent, in the Philippines. Table 9 presents the profile of applied MFN tariffs for the selected goods in the Philippines and highlights theextent of tariff peaks. As reported in table 9, tariff peaks abound in the footwear,transport equipment, textile/garments and miscellaneous sectors indicating thedefensive stance of current trade policy. The previous discussion reveals the overlapping defensive and offensive interests attached to the selected products for sectoral liberalization. Of interest however, is the overall assessment of the proposed modality insofar as it impacts Philippine trade negotiation strategy. This could be important because the sectoralliberalization that is proposed is essentially a package. In fact, the analytical baseprecludes the practice of picking sectors for the liberalization on mercantilist groundsas was done in previous attempts at sectoral liberalization. One method of evaluatingthe desirability of the proposed modality is to classify the intensity of interest into levels (Categories A, B or C) consistent with a set of criteria that defines the level. Of course, this method suffers from being static, short term, and ad hoc in formulation. On the other hand, it is quite flexible (the policymaker can devise their own criteria tosuit their priorities) and could easily be understood by the stakeholders. Thus, theoverall assessment of the list of sectors is always dependent on the set of criteria, i.e.subjective. Box 1 is one set of criteria for specifying levels of offensive and interest ofAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 88Table 8.

For purpose of evaluating the extent to which the offensive and defensive interests of the Philippines trade negotiation strategy will be served by the sectoral liberalization proposal, a set of criteria is proposed. Among the variables to beconsidered are relative share of the sector to total APEC exports, the absolute exportfigure and the average applied MFN tariffs of its APEC partners. To have a significantoffensive interest, the sector to be slated for liberalization should be a sizeableexportable of the Philippines already. By specifying a minimum export value hurdle, the criterion ensures that the Philippines has the capacity to exploit the market access improvement brought about by the sectoral liberalization. The current averageMFN tariff levied by APEC partners on the sectors programmed for liberalization isa strong measure of the incremental market access potential. The higher the averagetariffs currently, obviously, the greater market access created as a result of sectorTable 9.

Simple ave. applied MFN tariff of \"Principal Supplier \" Goods > imple ave. applied MFN tariffs of APEC members liberalization. The tariff computed is the average of the MFN tariffs levied by APEC partners on the sectors. In order to determine the impact of the sectoral liberalization, the APEC partners ' tariffs should be weighed by the shares of the APEC members ' imports in the total APEC exports of the Philippines in these sectors. One limitationof this indicator is that it does not take into account the existing RTAs that thePhilippine has concluded with APEC members, indicating a possible overstatement ofthe offensive interest. As outlined in box 1, the intensity of the offensive interest is governed not only by the magnitude of the potential export capability, nor only by the current average levels of tariffs on Philippine exports by its APEC partners, but alsoby the combination of variables. Thus, the offensive interest is deemed stronger if thevariables identified in the criteria appear simultaneously. On the other hand, indicators for the defensive interest include the presence of tariff peaks in at least 20 per cent of the tariff lines under the identified sector. Thetariff peak can be regarded as indicative of the sensitivity of the sector, particularly to international competition. In addition, one may also compare the average MFN tariff of the Philippines for the \"principal supplier \" goods with the average MFN tariff of the APEC member economies for the sectors proposed for sectoral liberalization. If theAPEC average MFN tariff of the sector in question exceeds that of the nationalAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 91average, then one can infer that the defensive interest in that sector is relatively pronounced. As the box shows, the intensity of the defensive interest is a function ofthe prevalence of tariff peaks and relative magnitudes of the MFN tariffs of the sectorin the region against the national average. Under this scheme, defensive interest isconsidered strong when the criteria of the incidence of tariff peaks and the magnitudeof average sectoral tariffs are simultaneously met. The position is said to be moderate or weak when either one of the criteria are met, but not simultaneously. Table 10 summarizes the degree of offensive and defensive interests of thePhilippines in each of the product groups identified for liberalization on a sectorallevel, according to categories and criteria outlined in box 1. Again, the criteria outlined in the box can be modified depending on the preference of the policymakers. Consequently, the definitions of strong, moderate orweak interest could vary depending on the criteria set. While this feature may render the process quite ad hoc , it nevertheless makes it quite flexible for purpose of policy research. V. FINAL REMARKS APEC has been at a crossroads for a number of years already. After the initial enthusiasm of Bogor waned in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, APEC triedto revive the trade liberalization agenda. The current initiative, FTAAP , has not beenfully supported by all members. While ambitious, a multitude of political sensitivitiesand the general RTA \"fatigue \" factor prevent the FTAAP from advancing forward strongly. Yet, it is still one of the most concrete ideas tabled to advance the pillar of trade liberalization. This paper puts forward an alternative to FTAAP . The modality is sectoral liberalization on an MFN basis, founded on the analytical basis of \"principal supplier \" approach and a variant of the non-preferential trading club. In a departure from theill-fated EVSL, the proposed initiative chooses the sectors to be liberalized on thebasis of minimizing free riding by non-APEC members. Candidates for sectoral liberalization are those sectors where APEC economies supply a significant portion of world exports. Using a benchmark or cut-off rate of 70 per cent, over 282 productsare identified for sectoral liberalization. These products, in total, constitute close tohalf of all APEC exports and about 40 per cent of APEC imports in 2005. Of course, while the APEC, as a collective, stands to benefit from the proposed sectoral liberalization, the impact on the individual member differs from oneeconomy to another. The case study on the Philippines showed that sectoral liberalization, whilst serving its offensive interests, have a negative impact on theAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 92defensive interests in some sectoral categories. Because of the trade-offs, a balancing of the political economy of sectoral liberalization has to be struck. Thispaper provides a system of assessing the offensive and defensive interest of members in light of the liberalization methodology proposed, as an aid for decision-making. Given a set of criteria that includes export shares, incidence of tariffpeaks, etc., the Philippines has moderate offensive and defensive interests in thesectors identified for liberalization. Of course, this analysis did not take intoconsideration the increase in consumer welfare that liberalization makes possible. Admittedly, the proposed sectoral initiative has a more modest claim to liberalization outcomes compared to the FTAAP . However, the outcomes may be more politically acceptable to members because of the manner in which the free rider problem is skirted. Thus, there could be greater scope for APEC members toharmonize their liberalization efforts by targeting the selected sectors. In addition,because of its MFN characteristic, it is more in keeping with the WTO principle andcould, in fact, be a catalyst in pushing forward the DDA. This is open regionalism.Table 10.

For this paper, an econometric approach to small area estimation, known as the ELL method, was applied to estimate poverty and inequalityindicators in small areas 1of the Islamic Republic of Iran. This study aims to determine patterns of poverty and inequality in small areas andhousehold characteristics related to them in order to provide practicaltools for a geographically targeted pro-poor policy. Drawbacks in the current Government welfare policy (uniform cash distribution) along with the diversity among provinces and small areas regarding scale of povertyand inequality and their correlates, as well as the level of living standards,underlines the need to utilize small area estimations as a forevidence-based policymaking. JEL classification: G51, I32, I38. Key words: Small area estimation, poverty, inequality. I. INTRODUCTION Small area estimation (SAE) methods are statistical techniques that borrow strength from auxiliary information to estimate desired parameter(s) more preciselythan by direct estimation. 2 The comprehensiveness of coverage of census data on * Graduate School of Economics, Tokyo International University (TIU). The author is indebted to anonymous referees and the editor for their very helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.Special thanks should be given to faculty of graduate school of economics at TIU for theirrecommendations and suggestions, in particular Professor Atsushi Maki. The author remains responsiblefor remaining errors. 1For the purposes of this study, small areas are defined as urban and rural areas for each county. 2A comprehensive review of the existing methodology on SAE and some recent developments on the topic can be found in Rao (2003), Longford (2005) and S\u00e4rndal (2007).Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 126the one hand, and insufficient sample size in sub-domains in the household income and expenditure surveys on the other hand, prompted a research team from the WorldBank to introduce an econometric solution for the small area problem. Elbers,J. Lanjouw and P . Lanjouw (2002) proposed a method (called ELL) which combinesinformation from a household survey and a census to predict per capita expenditureas a measure of living standards for all households in the census dataset. In this research, the ELL method has been applied to estimate poverty and inequality indicators in small areas in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The method utilized micro-data from a household income and expenditure survey (HIES)conducted in 2007 combined with population and housing census 2006 dataset. Thediscrepancy in poverty and inequality among small areas is obvious from the results,with location being the most deterministic factor pertaining to poverty incidence. Thisstudy suggests that the existing strategy of uniform cash redistribution in the Islamic Republic of Iran be replaced with a geographically targeted policy utilizing SAE. After taking into account many household characteristics, location has a significantcorrelation with poverty and inequality. Although the lack of spatial informationprevents us from identifying the geographical features behind the impact of location,policymakers still need to take this into account and avoid uniform treatments fordifferent areas. On the other hand, comparing poverty lines reveals a large differencein living standards across regions (urban and rural areas of each province). The diversity in poverty and inequality combined with the fact that the impact of household characteristics varies across regions could exacerbate the effects ofuniform redistribution policies on the household welfare. No studies on poverty and inequality for small areas have been completed in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Government, through the Statistical Research andTraining Center, conducted two major studies in 2002 and 2003 on poverty but theirscope was limited to calculating only poverty lines and some other poverty indicators at the country level, in seven regions and for some occupation levels. Notably, two predominant studies on poverty and inequality are Assadzadeh and Paul (2004) andSalehi-Isfahani (2009). The former evaluated changes in the extent of poverty in theIslamic Republic of Iran during the post Islamic period and the latter one examines thetrend of poverty and inequality in the three decades after the revolution. Assadzadehand Paul (2004) calculated poverty and inequality indicators not only for the country as a whole, but also for nine geographic areas as well as for occupation levels. Based on the existing literature in the Islamic Republic of Iran, researchers in thecountry have been trying to estimate welfare indicators below the country level, butdue to limited sample size in small areas, the surveys mentioned above only cover theregions and some wide demographic groups. Nonetheless, ELL has been extensivelyimplemented in several countries in the last decades, including, among others, inAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 127Cambodia (Fujii, 2007), Indonesia (Suryahadi and others, 2005), the Philippines (Haslett and Jones, 2005) and Viet Nam (Minot, Baulch, Epprecht, 2006). The remainder of this paper is devoted to reviewing the methods used in the analysis, to be introduced in section II, and evaluating poverty and inequality patternsusing small area estimations and poverty and inequality maps in section III. SectionIV contains policy implications based on the findings of the paper. II. ESTIMATION METHODS The ELL method is used mainly for poverty mapping for SAE. Recently developed by the World Bank, this method utilizes census information to predict welfare measurements for households at the micro-level. This section introduces the ELL method as well as the methodology used to determine poverty and inequality correlates to compare and analyse these aspects ofwelfare in small areas. ELL method Consider y ih as per capita expenditure of household h (h = 1, 2, ..., ni) in area i (i = 1, 2, ..., A) where ni is the number of sample units in area i and A is the total number of small areas. The main concern is to fit an accurate predictive model of yih. The following is a linear approximation to the conditional distribution of yih. In yih uih(1) where xih is the vector of auxiliary variables (limiting to those that are common to both survey and the latest census) for household h in the i th area and the vector of disturbances, u, follows distribution F (0, ). The xih includes both household and area level variables to capture the effect of household and individual characteristicsas well as regional effects (tables A.1 and A.2 list these variables). Since the predictive model (1) has been applied for each province separately, the variables involved in x ih vary across provinces. Thus, depending on the matching outcomes, a subset of potential variables presented in the appendix is used for each province.The disturbance u ih contains all the effects not described by auxiliary variables. Although the area auxiliary information is involved in the xih, some unexplained effects of area on the welfare will remain in the u. Therefore, allowing for area effects, the following model is suggested for the disturbance term:Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 128uih = i + ih(2) In model (2) i is area random effect, independent to ih, and both are uncorrelated to xih. An initial estimate of in equation (1) is obtained from the ordinary least square (OLS) or weighted least squares (WLS) estimation and then \u00fbih denotes the estimated values of disturbances. No heteroskedasticity for the area random effecthas been assumed, as many areas (672 in our case) are too small to causeheterogeneity. However, we allow for heteroskedasticity for variance of ih. From this error specification, one can also imply that the less the share of area effect in total error variance, the less one benefits from disaggregating data. From the followingdecomposition we can get the estimated values of i, ih and also variance of ih: \u00fbih = = i + eih(3) Where \u00fbi. is the mean of estimated disturbances, \u00fbih, over households in the area i which estimates i, and eih = \u00fbih - \u00fbi. estimates ih. Elbers and others (2002) proposed a logistic form for variance of ih to avoid negative or extremely high predicted variances, In = zT ih + rih or e2 ih = , in which A and B are upper and lower bounds to avoid extreme values for the variance and zih is a vector of household characteristics which is not necessarily different from xih. These bounds can be estimated simultaneously with parameter . However, Elbers and others (2002) found that using measures B = 0 and A = 1.05 x max ( e2 ih) leads to similar estimates of model parameters which are more practical. This logistic form also does not allow for negative values of variance. The variance estimator for ih can be achieved as follow by using the delta method (Greene, 2007). 2 ih = + \u2014 v\u00e2r (r) (4) The other component of variance is variance of area random effects, 2 , which is estimated using moment conditions (Elbers and others, 2002). After estimating variance of error terms, 2 ih and 2 ih, generalized least square (GLS) estimates of model parameters, GLS, have been obtained by applying estimated variance covariance matrix . Sampling weights are incorporated in all steps in the model estimation. 1 2 [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]AB 1 + B AB (1 - B) (1 + B)3AezT ih + rih + B 1 + ezT ih - B A - e2 ih Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 129At this point, the estimated error terms, i and eihare simulated, either by assuming proper distributional form for them or using their empirical distributions.Simulation allows us to estimate welfare indicators (introduced later in this section) aswell as their sampling errors. The ELL method uses bootstrapping to simulate welfareestimators. In this method, we repeatedly draw samples with replacement randomlyfrom the error terms ' empirical distribution or from suitable distributions (normal or t-student with proper degrees of freedom). Then the welfare indicator for the small area i, W i, can be estimated as Wi = where Wir is the simulated welfare indicator in i the small area and R is the number of iterations. The variance of welfare estimates can simply be estimated as follows: Var(Wi) = \u2014 (Wir - Wi)2(6) Practical aspects This section clarifies some important aspects of the econometric model and illustrates the method with which we can derive explanatory variables that are asaccurate as possible to ensure that all the potential of the census information isutilized to predict the household 's per capita expenditure precisely. The main purpose of this practice is to choose explanatory variables that are proxy indicators ofa household 's consumption and have strong logical and empirical links to that. One advice would be to identify all possible main determinants, including, among others, household size, the age and gender composition of the household, education, health, social capital and assets, and leave the effects of other factors that operate at higherlevels to be captured by the area random effect. To ensure that all aspects ofconsumption expenditure are considered and household information is used in themost efficient way, a comprehensive list of potential proxy indicators (explanatoryvariables) which meet some eligibility conditions (their wording and response options in the questionnaire, reference periods, concepts and distributions, which all have to be same for both survey and census) has been identified for entry into theeconometric model. Therefore, all these criteria have been tested beforehand andonly variables that met these three conditions were identified as candidates as proxyindicators. The two most important considerations are the following: The linkage between census and HIES is rather tenuous because of the differing context of the two data collection processes. The wording and format of the questions have been checked to ensure ~ WirR r = 1 R R r = 11 R~~Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 130that the difference in wording or response options do not generate conceptual inconsistencies and in case of disagreements, possiblechanges were made to resolve them. Typical examples are joboccupation and head of collective households. A particular question must measure the same feature and provide the same range of information in both systems. Probable differencesbetween the two systems regarding concept, referenced period orsubpopulation covered by the question should be carefully taken intoaccount. For instance, the distinction between agriculture andnon-agriculture occupations has different criteria in two systems. In order to have consistency between census and survey, the job occupation in HIES has been redefined using International StandardIndustrial Classification (ISIC) codes. Annex table A.1 shows the final list of potential variables after taking into account the requirements and adjusting some questions, such as recoding, collapsingresponse options and redefining subpopulations. In order to achieve household variables, the initial variables need to be checked to make sure that the distribution is the same in the survey and census. There are several methods to test the distributions depending on the type of the data. However, these statistical tests are sometimes very strict and we may lose all thepotential variables using these criteria. Therefore, it suffices to test for equality of themeans of the continuous and the proportion of the categorical variables. Thevariables with statistically equal means (proportions) in both the census and thesurvey have been determined as matched variables for every province separately and applied in the corresponding predictive model. Therefore, among the provinces, there may be different sets of matched variables. To take into account the area effect, an area level vector of independent variables should be introduced into the consumption model. In contrast to thehousehold variables, for this part, only census aggregate information in the area levelcan be used. This enables us to also benefit from variables that have not beenequally distributed in the survey and the census. For example, household size has different means in the survey and the census in rural areas but for this part, average household size for each area as an independent variable can be used. The sameapplies to availability of gas, telephones, car or sanitation systems, which areanticipated to influence the household welfare level. The area level independentvariables are listed in annex table A.2.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 131An important consideration about the model is that it is estimated only for predictive purposes, and it would not be appropriate for concluding any cause-effectrelationships between household expenditure (income) and the proxy indicators.Therefore, the magnitude and signs of the coefficients are not important in suchpredictive models. What matters here is the level of correlation, or the R-squaredvalue of the regression of lny on X. In fact, this econometric model is designed to capture the association between expenditure and some proxy variables, and to return a prediction as accurate as possible. Nevertheless, it does not mean that thestatistical significance of the coefficients is not a consideration. Indeed, it isimportant to select proxy indicators that will lead to a model with an R-squared valueas close to 1 as possible while having all coefficients statistically significant. Poverty lines To measure poverty indicators in a society, it is necessary to have a threshold of access to goods and services under which individuals are classified as poor.Poverty line is a monetary cost to a given person, at a given place and time, ofa reference level of welfare (Ravallion, 1998). Poverty studies on the Islamic Republic of Iran have used different measures of poverty lines due to either conceptual or technical differences. However all ofstudies were taken at the country level or ultimately cover geographical regions or occupational categories. As this study analyses welfare in small areas, using such country-wide poverty lines demands a very restrictive assumption on tastes, livingstandards and markets. On the other hand, the HIES sampling design allows forestimation of poverty line in each region (urban and rural areas for each province).Following Ravallion (1998) with slight modifications, particularly correcting for outliersof average cost of one kilocalorie (Kcal) per person, a poverty line has been estimated for every region based on cost of basic needs (CBN). The CBN poverty line has two components, food and non-food. The following is short description of estimationprocess for the CBN method. 3 Food component A critical issue regarding the food component is the minimum nutritional requirement for an individual. Although international institutes, such as the World Bank, suggest 2,100 Kcal per person per day, not all countries use that figure as the standard criterion. In fact, the Islamic Republic of Iran does not seem to have an 3For more detailed review of this, please refer to Ravallion (1994, 1998).Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 132official criterion for this.4 To keep comparability with other studies and to stay close to international standards, 2,200 Kcal was used for this study as the minimum nutritionalrequirement for good health. To compute the minimum cost of the caloric requirement, a reference group must be selected. As the demand patterns are unknown in the regions, one methodis to use a nationally fixed group, poorest 30 per cent in this case, and set a bundle ofgoods for each region from the individuals who belong to this national reference group. After finding the average calorie cost per person in each region, food poverty line is L F i = Ci x 2,200 per person per year in region i in which Ci is the average calorie cost per person per year in the reference group of the i th region. Non-food component The welfare consistency and time and location matters are more significant when it comes to the non-food poverty line. Ravallion (1994) suggested upper and lower bounds for non-food component of poverty line. The upper bound is the mean per capita per year non-food expenditure for households whose food spending equalsthe food poverty line. The lower bound is the mean per capita per year non-foodexpenditure for households whose total expenditure equals food poverty line. Thenthe following is defined: Upper line in region i : L U i = Lower line in region i : LL i = LF i x (2 - Si ) Si : Average food-share in the corresponding reference group in region i. in which LF, LU and LL are the food component of the poverty line and the upper and lower bounds for the non-food component, respectively. A conservative poverty line for region i is the average line given by the arithmetic mean of upper and lower lines; Li = . 4To the best of my knowledge, at least five measures have been used in previous studies. 2,197 and 2,300 (Statistical Center of Iran, 2004), 2,200 (Management and Planning Organization, 2000), 2,168(Pajooyan, 1994), 2,500 (Akhavi, 1996). The author's calculations, however, indicate that the minimumrequirement should be 2,448 Kcal according to the table of the daily minimum caloric requirementadjusted for age distribution in 2006 housing and population census.LF i Si LL i + LU i 2Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 133Annex table A.3 shows the regional poverty lines as well as the national level lines for rural and urban areas. One may question that sample sizes are not largeenough in each province to estimate precise poverty lines. 5 However, through the application of the bootstrap method with 1,000 replication, the coefficient of variation(CV) for poverty lines in all 60 regions have been estimated. The CVs vary in therange of 1 to 6 per cent, which is quite reasonable. A comparison between the regions by their poverty lines may be misleading. As these poverty lines are absolute in terms of living standards and in this case the household consumption is the living standard indicator, differences between povertylines arise from several factors which affect average household expenditures ina particular region, such as public goods availability, living standards, consumers ' taste, household wealth, price levels and relative prices and natural endowments.The reference groups for the non-food component provide different functions for upper and lower poverty lines. Depending on the case, any of the poverty lines can be used in welfare policies. For instance, in minimum wage determination,a government may decide to use the upper poverty line, but in the case of foodsubsidies, the lower poverty line would be a better criterion to distinguish householdsthat are unable to meet the minimum quantity of food intake after spending on verybasic non-food commodities. The average poverty line is a conservative line to bereported as official statistics and suitable for policy evaluation and countrywide comparisons. In this study, the average poverty lines are used for small area estimations in each province. Poverty and inequality correlates In addition to the regional pattern and the disparity of poverty and inequality, an informed welfare policy requires information on attendant correlates of the welfare indicators. A regression-based inequality decomposition method (Fields, 2003) has been used to find the contribution of each explanatory variable and consequently,each category of variables in per capita expenditure 's variation. A logistic regression has been applied to find influential factors on the likelihood of being poor. Obviously,provincial poverty lines have to be used for the latter one to distinguish the poor fromthe non-poor. The same explanatory variables have been included in the two models. Annex table A.4 presents explanatory variables of models (7) and (10). In addition to the variables in annex table A.4, location dummies have been introduced into themodel to capture the regional effects. Although the regional effects are not veryinformative without doing spatial analysis, the magnitude of the effects is stimulus forfurther deep analysis on regional differences and also for policy implication purposes. 5The HIES sample sizes vary in the range of 480 to 1,700 households across small areas.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 134Inequality decomposition It is a very common practice in poverty studies to fit a semi-log regression model to generate per capita income (consumption expenditure) using explanatory variables found by either past experiences or according to the theory. Fields (2001, 2003) used this income-generating model to decompose income inequality not onlyfor one single model but also to find the contribution of explanatory variables in theinequality changes between two groups or times. This paper only addresses theformer objective and uses the regression-based inequality decomposition method tofind the share of per capita expenditure inequality which is attributable to each explanatory variable and each group of variables. Below is an example of a similar model with equation (1), but without the complicated error specifications. In y = X + u (7) Where y and X are a vector of per capita consumption expenditure and a matrix of explanatory variables, respectively. u is the error vector and is the vector of model parameters to be estimated. The rirst column of the explanatory variables matrix, X, always accounts for the intercept. Therefore, X is in the dimension of n x (K + 1) in which K is number of explanatory variables and n number of households. The contribution of k th explanatory variable is given by equation (8). SK = (8) where k is the OLS estimation of corresponding model parameter for k th variable, xk is the k th explanatory variable and 2 In y is the variance of. The sK can be interpreted as the share of explanatory variable xk in the total variation of logarithm of per capita expenditure. It is clear from equation (8) that the contribution of the intercept in the expenditure variation is zero.6 The important identity of sk is that Sk = R2 and sequentially Su = 1 - Sk . Therefore, the percentage contribution of th variable in the R-square can be calculated as:k cov ( xk, In y) 2 In y 6Morduch and Sicular (2002) disputed this decomposition method, first proposed by Fields (1998), for zero contribution of constant term due to log functional form. Nonetheless, in the Morduch and Sicular(2002) proposed model neither can derive the contribution of intercept and error term from the natural ruleof decomposition, whereas a large share of expenditure variation is left unexplained in the proposedfunctional form. For a general approach to the inequality decomposition refer to Wan (2004).K k = 1K k = 1Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 135Pk = x 100 In other words Pk is the share of k th variable in the model predictability. In practice, there are different types of explanatory variables in matrix X. For continuous variables, only one sk exists, but in the case of categorical variables, the contribution of each variable equals the total of all sk's for corresponding dummies in the model. Also, for each category of variables, such as demography or assets, thecontribution coefficient is again simply the total of all s k's in the category. Poverty correlates Logistic regression analysis is often used to investigate the relationship between discrete responses and a set of explanatory variables. For binary responsemodels, the response of a sampling unit may or may not take a specified value (in thiscase, per capita expenditure may or may not be under the poverty line). Suppose x is a row vector of explanatory variables and is the response probability (probability of being poor) to be modeled. The linear logistic model would then have the followingform: log it ( ) = log ( ) = + x (10) in which is the intercept parameter and is the vector of the slope parameters. The left-hand side of this equation is called the log odds ratio. Obviously, provincialpoverty lines have been used to construct the response variable. 7 Poverty and inequality indices Among the numerous articles on poverty and inequality measures, one of the most widely used sources is Fields (2001), which covers a wide range of poverty andinequality indicators. For this study, the most popular indices have been applied tocompare both poverty and inequality among small areas. A class of poverty measures identified by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984) known as FGT measures can be expressed as follows: P = wi ( ) (yi < z, W = wi ) (11)sk R2 7A maximum likelihood estimation of parameters can be computed by using computer programs, which are relatively inexpensive. The reader may refer to Maddala (2001) for more technical details. 1 - 1 Wnp i = 1zz - yi iAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 136where z is the poverty line, yi is expenditure for i th poor individual, np number of poor individuals and wi is the sampling weight for i th sampling unit. The different values of in equation (11) give different measures of poverty. Poverty incidence, the proportion of the population whose annual per capita incomefalls below annual per capita poverty threshold level is derived when = 0. This measure is referred to as the poverty head count ratio. The depth of poverty (or thepoverty gap) is derived when = 1. P1 takes into account not only how many people are poor but how poor they are on average. If we rearrange the formula (11) for P1, it is equal to the head count ratio ( P0) multiplied by the average percentage gap between the poverty line and the income (expenditure) of the poor. When = 2, this equation gives a measure known as severity of poverty (or squared poverty gap). P2 takes into account not only how many people are poor and how poor they are but also the degree of income inequality among poor households. It is equal to the incidence of poverty ( P0) multiplied by the average squared percentage gap between the poverty line and the income of the poor. Inequality measures show the degree of the discrepancy among individuals in terms of their income (expenditure). The Gini coefficient is the most commonlyused inequality measure in the literature. Equation (12) shows a weighted form of theGini index, 8 Gini = + wi yi [i + ( wi - 1)](12) i = i-1 + wi-1 (i > 1), 1 = 1 in which y is the average per capita expenditure in the region. In fact, the Gini coefficient is the area above the Lorenz curve and below the diagonal 45-degree line divided by the area under the diagonal line. III. NUMERICAL RESULTS An extensive number of estimates has been produced by using the above- mentioned techniques, making comparisons and interpretations difficult. To preventconfusion, this report does not focus on detailed estimations over small areas butinstead concentrates on some extreme cases. Maps are very instrumental tools tovisually compare different areas and diagnosing the patterns and disparities of 8The reader may refer to Deaton (1997) for more details.W + 1 W - 1 2 W (W -1)y-i -Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 137indicators over the country.9 Annex figure A.1 shows the location and names of provinces. National and regional poverty and inequality The results indicate that the national headcount poverty rate ( P0) in rural areas (15 per cent) is significantly higher than in urban areas (11 per cent). This gap iseven wider when comparing the depth of poverty ( P 1). The national level in rural areas is 0.04 compared to 0.029 in urban areas. As for the severity of poverty, the ( P1) indicator, in which the distribution of the expenditure is rated in addition to thepoverty gap, the figure is 50 per cent higher in rural areas at 0.018 versus 0.012 inurban areas. For the study, the Gini index was used to measure inequality in terms of per capita consumption expenditure. Even though poverty incidence is higher in ruralareas, the results show that income (expenditure) is distributed more equally in rural areas than in urban areas. This is due to homogeneity of living standards among rural households. At the regional level, the rankings of urban and rural areas in terms of P 0 by province tend to vary. This is not the case, however, for province 11 (Sist \u00e3n va Baluchest \u00e3n), ranked as the poorest province in both its urban and rural areas and province 02 (M \u00e3zandar \u00e3n), ranked as the second richest province in both areas. The largest gap between urban and rural areas in terms of poverty incidence has been detected in provinces 23 (Tehr \u00e3n) and 15 (Lorest \u00e3n). In these two provinces, the people in the rural areas are much poorer than those in urban areas (more than twice).Annex table A.5 shows national and regional estimates of poverty and inequality. Poverty and inequality in small areas The Islamic Republic of Iran consists of 336 counties. To account for the urban and rural areas in each county, welfare indicators have been estimated in 672 small areas which range in population from 781 to 7,872,280. This level of disaggregation is very informative for pro-poor policies since it provides keyinformation for studying patterns in poverty and inequality and their relationships withother characteristics of small areas. 9Detailed statistics on the small area estimations are presented in Bidarbakht-Nia (2009) and are also available from the author upon request.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 138Poverty and inequality in rural areas A comparison of the estimates of the regional level with those of the small areas indicates that using only regionally disaggregated information in policymaking is unreliable. Although province 01 (Gil \u00e3n), for example, has a relatively low rate of poverty and inequality, there is considerable diversity in all of the indicators amongthe counties in the province. In province 05, (Kerm \u00e3nsh\u00e3h), the discrepancy is wide with regards to expenditure inequality and in provinces 06 (Khuzest \u00e3n), (Golest \u00e3n), only the poverty indicators vary within each province. In province 00 (Markazi), most of the counties fall in the first quintile (poorest 20 per cent) and in 03 (East Ajarb \u00e3ij\u00e3n), all counties fall in the last quintile of inequality (20 per cent highest inequality). In province 06 (Khuzest \u00e3n), most of the counties have high poverty and low inequality. In provinces 18 (Bushehr), 26 (Ghazvin), 24 (Ardebil)and 02 (M \u00e3zandar \u00e3n), all of their counties are relatively better off when compared with provinces 11 (Sist \u00e3n va Baluchest \u00e3n) and 21 (Yazd) in which almost all of their counties suffer from high poverty and inequality. Kohrang and Ardal are the only counties in 14 (Ch \u00e3harmah \u00e3l va Bakhti \u00e3ri) that suffer from a high poverty rate. As extreme cases, Sav \u00e3d-Kuh, Jam and Tonekabon have the lowest poverty rate (less than 3 per cent) and Ir \u00e3nshahr, Sarb \u00e3z and Sh \u00e3deg\u00e3n have the highest poverty rate (more than 47 per cent). Of note, all the counties in the 11 (Sist \u00e3n va Baluchest \u00e3n) fall in the last quintile in terms of poverty but vary among quintiles in terms of inequality. Poverty and inequality in urban areas As for the rural areas, diversity among counties inside the provinces is obvious in some cases. Poverty indicators in provinces 27 (Golest \u00e3n), 14 (Ch\u00e3harmah \u00e3l and 23 (Tehr \u00e3n) vary widely among their small areas. In province 08 (Kerm \u00e3n), the county Bam, is an exception as its poverty incidence and inequality (poverty rate 6 per cent and Giniindex 0.37) are both relatively low. This is due to the reconstruction activities and aid tied to the 2003 earthquake in this area. In province 23 (Tehr \u00e3n), the characteristics of the capital city, also called Tehr \u00e3n, is a totally different than what is found in the counties. Tehr \u00e3n enjoys a low poverty rate compared with other counties in the province but its Gini coefficients are almost the same, with the exception of somesmall counties in which inequality is not surprisingly very low due to similaritiesbetween households. Province 21 (Yazd), 22 (Hormozg \u00e3n) and 29 (South Khoras \u00e3n) have high levels of poverty and inequality in almost all their counties. In (13) Hamed \u00e3n, most of the areas have high inequality but low poverty rates. In 11 (Sist \u00e3n va Baluchest \u00e3n), a majority of its counties have poverty rates between 30 per centAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 139and 62 per cent. Two counties in the province that are an exception to this are Zahak and Kon \u00e3rak, which have very low poverty and inequality levels. In province 06 (Khuzest \u00e3n), half of its counties are in the last quintile (poorest 20 per cent) with respect to the poverty rate despite the fact that the province hasa lot of industry, including oil production, contributes a share of 15.4 per cent to thecountry 's GDP (the second highest share after Tehr \u00e3n) and has the second highest per capita GDP after province 17 (Kohgiluyeh va Boyrahmad). This shows that there is a gap between production value added (or GDP) and disposable income. Although per capita GDP mainly represents the productivity of the people in one region, it is nota good proxy for income in regional studies. This is because the central governmenttends to control the reallocation of the budget and one of the factors for determininghow the funds are distributed is based on the political power of local governments,which often takes precedence over regional GDP . Surprisingly, inequality is relatively low in this province (mostly around 0.35). The least poor small urban areas (with a poverty rate of less than 3 per cent) are Jam, Bushehr, Gil have the highest level of poverty incidence (more than 47 per cent). In summary, the estimated poverty rate is less than 0.10 in 31 per cent of the rural counties and more than 0.20 in almost 29 per cent of counties. These statisticsare correspondingly 36 per cent and 26 per cent for urban counties which shows thatmore rural areas are in poverty (in terms of proportion) than urban areas. Mapping poverty and inequality Poverty mapping methods have been utilized to visually investigate patterns in welfare indicators in the country. The incidence of poverty in urban areas is shownin annex figures A.2 and A.3. A comparison between two figures shows that thepoverty rate varies widely within one province and that the scale of discrepancy is very different among provinces. For example, in provinces 09 (Khor \u00e3san Razavi) and 11 (Sist \u00e3n va Baluchest \u00e3n), poverty rates among counties range between less than 6 per cent and more than 60 per cent, while in provinces 04 (West Azerb \u00e3ij\u00e3n), 18 (Bushehr), 12 02 (M \u00e3zandar \u00e3n), the rates differ between 1 per cent and 15 per cent. Generally speaking, in the north-central andnorth-western parts of the country, there is homogeneity among the interior areas, while in the eastern and south-western regions, the provinces are heterogeneous and generally have higher rates of poverty. In terms of climate circumstances, with theexception of 18 (Bushehr) and 29 (South Khor \u00e3s\u00e3n), the provinces under study with favourable weather conditions, have relatively low poverty levels in their urban areas.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 140Some may assume that this is tied to productive agricultural activities but it could easily be tied to other income-generating factors, such as tourism and access to theforeign market (either legal or illegal). In the case of province 18 (Bushehr), the lowlevel of poverty may be attributed to income generated from a special economic zoneset up there that enables access to foreign markets through the Persian Gulf.Nevertheless, the information available is not definitive and can only serve as guide in determining the patterns and the magnitude of the effects of some explanatory variables. More information is needed to ascertain the spatial differences and theirdeterminants. Annex figures A.4 and A.5 illustrate rural poverty rates in provinces andsmall areas, respectively. Similar to the urban case, the disparity in some provinces isconsiderable in rural areas. The pattern of poverty in rural areas in the north-westernpart of the country is quite different from its urban counterparts. The urban areas are better off than the rural areas, with the exception of the borderline areas in the northern part of this region where the economy benefits from access to foreignmarkets and productive agricultural activities. Another way to determine patterns of poverty is to estimate the number of people whose income is under the poverty line in each small area (poverty density).Poverty density for each area is estimated by multiplying the corresponding povertyrate times the population. Annex figures A.6 and A.7 depict poverty densities forurban and rural areas, respectively. In these maps, each dot represents 400 individuals living under the provincial poverty line. Notably, in both urban and rural areas, regions with high levels of poverty tend to have low poverty density. Anexception to this is the south-east region. As poor areas are mainly located in theeastern part of the country, which, except for the extreme north-east, has a desertclimate and is less populated than other regions. Generally speaking, many areaswith low level of poverty incidence, which may not be considered as a priority in pro-poor policies, have high density of poverty. Therefore, it must be noted that relying only on the poverty rate may cause exclusion of the majority of the poorpeople in the country. To avoid this, it is very helpful to carefully examine all povertyand inequality indicators simultaneously for areas. Since none of the existing povertyindicators contributes poverty density in the formula it is more likely to be ignored. Acomparison of the maps on poverty rate and poverty density shows that in some provinces, such as 06 (Khuzest \u00e3n), 25 (Ghom), and in some areas in 11 (Sist \u00e3n va Baluchest \u00e3n), there is a high level of poverty not only in terms of percentage but also regarding population in poverty. Consequently, multivariable clustering is required toput similar counties in the same category (discussed later in this section). A comparison between rural and urban areas regarding their inequality Gini index (annex figures A.8 - A.11) for the country as a whole illustrates that the general level of inequality in rural areas is lower than in urban areas. This can attributed to theAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 141narrower differences in living standards among rural households. Despite the diversity in poverty, inequality is homogeneous across the country. As discussed indetail later in this study, location is the main explanatory variable for povertyincidence. On the other hand, household characteristics have more of an effect onthe level of inequality than location effects. Finally, to assist in setting priorities for policymaking, small areas have been clustered based on the poverty and inequality indicators (three FGT indicators, the Gini coefficient and poverty density) utilizing a fuzzy clustering technique. Small areas in each cluster are similar regarding to all of their poverty and inequality indicators. 10 Table 1 shows the cluster means of poverty and inequality indicators. In this table,small areas in cluster 1 can be considered non-poor on average, based on allindicators, and sequentially clusters 2 and 3 are worse off except in the case of Ginicoefficient in rural areas. Table 1. Cluster means of welfare indicators Cluster* P0 P1 P2 GINI Poverty Density Urban 1 0.08 0.005 0.37 5 808 2 0.14 0.03 0.012 0.39 13 3423 0.24 0.07 0.41 1 0.09 0.007 0.34 4 682 2 0.16 0.04 0.015 0.39 8 348 3 0.26 0.07 0.029 0.37 19 493 * Number of clusters (3) is arbitrarily determined. 10For more detail explanations about fuzzy clustering, please refer to Bezdek (1980).This classification does not mean that, for example, every small area in cluster 1 has a lower poverty incidence than small areas in other clusters. Detailedinformation shows that there might be small areas with one or more relatively highwelfare indicators in cluster 1. This is because the membership function for eachsmall area is a multivariate function in which all the indicators are simultaneouslyconsidered. Annex figures A.12 and A.13 map the clustered small areas. Poverty and inequality correlates The evaluations outlined in previous sections indicate that the patterns of poverty and inequality vary greatly across the country and between urban and ruralareas. Policies aimed at mitigating household deprivations need to be informed withAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 142disaggregated statistics that visually illustrate areas and subpopulations with high priorities regarding poverty and inequality. Nevertheless, at this point, two importantquestions remain unanswered; \"what characteristics explain the inequality? \" and \"who is more likely to be poor? \" This study does not assume that there is causality relationship between poverty and inequality and household characteristics. Instead, itdetermines what factors explain inequality and are more closely related to the likelihood of being poor. To show the general effect of explanatory variables on poverty and inequality, the country level models (for rural and urban separately) havebeen fitted. Moreover, a linear logistic model has been estimated separately for eachprovince in order to monitor different effects of explanatory variables on povertyacross regions. Regarding to the inequality decomposition, the contribution of eachexplanatory variable ( S k) and, to be more precise, the share of each variable in the R-square ( Pk) have been calculated for the national level.11 Bar charts in figure 1 show the percentage share of each category in the predictability of the country-level model.In other words, it indicates the overall effect of each group of explanatory variables onthe expenditure distribution in country level. The asset category is the most influentialfactor in both urban and rural with almost half of the contribution in the per capitaexpenditure variation. In both rural and urban areas, education level and location are two other effective categories with the difference being that location has much greater effect in rural areas than in urban areas. This may be attributed to the many spatialcharacteristics which could affect the income level and income inequality in ruralareas, such as transportation facilities, natural endowments and distances to the bigcities. As location is an exogenous variable, this result suggests that investing ininfrastructure in rural areas could mitigate inequality. However, to determine this,more Geographical Information Systems (GIS) information is required to analyse the spatial determinants of the poverty and inequality. Inside categories, the most effective variables are car ownership and the floor area per person in the asset groupfor both urban and rural areas. In the case of demographic the size of household hasthe most influence on the per capita expenditure disparity. The interpretation of coefficients in the logit model is not straightforward and usually requires some extra work after parameter estimations have been made. Inthis paper, the explanatory variables (annex table A.4) are divided into three groups according to their measurement scale: dummy variables, ratios and other types (continuous or counts). The coefficients are interpreted as the amount of change inlog odds due to a one unit increase in explanatory variables. Thus, absolute values ofthe coefficients are comparable in each category; the corresponding explanatory 11Since semi-logarithmic functional form applied to inequality decomposition is not mean-independent, only a country model has been fitted for inequality decomposition.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 143Figure 1. Percentage contribution of each category of variables in the R-square of expenditure model variable becomes more effective as the absolute value of the coefficient increases. The logit model has been applied at the country and the provincial levels in both ruraland urban areas. Table 2 illustrates the most effective variables in country model.Note that location dummy variables (336-1 dummies for counties ' effects in the model) have been excluded from the comparison. However, when the location parameter estimation is included, it can be observed that in the dummy group, about 90 per cent of location effects (either positive or negative effects depending on the degree of poverty) in urban areas and60 per cent in rural areas are significant and more influential than other dummyvariables. Location effects are more informative when using provincial models forgeographically targeted pro-poor policies. The regional results (not presented here)indicated that in almost every province location is highly correlated with poverty likelihood. These results only show the degree of importance of location when analysing poverty. However, information available cannot explain why location is sucha determinant factor. Lack of GIS information in the Islamic Republic of Iran, such asdistance to the markets (domestic and foreign) and facilities, soil fertility and climate41 16 11 382147 17 12 2617 0204060 Asset DemographicEducation Employment Public UtilityLocationUrban Rural Per centAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 144does not allow spatial analysis in our case. Although the most effective variables from the country level were presented in the above table, locally targeted policies need toconsider provincial models in which every province has its own characteristics andpoverty attendant correlates. For instance, in country as a whole, car ownership significantly increases the likelihood that a person will be classified as non-poor, while in provincial models, this variable has very different effects in different provinces. IV. POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSION The results of the study clearly show that the Islamic Republic of Iran is in need of a transparent and comprehensive anti-poverty policy in order to overcome itshigh level of poverty and inequality. Maps and statistics not only delineate these highlevels but also show the disparity of the extent to which people are in poverty amongregions. Numerical results and maps also illustrate patterns of poverty and inequality in small geographic regions and provide useful information about their attendant correlates. Maps depict the priority areas regarding each aspect of poverty andinequality. The results also suggest that location has a great deal to do withunderstanding the economic welfare of households. Small area estimationsuncovered that even within prosperous regions, there may be a few areas withextreme poverty levels. Some regions are uniformly in poverty while in others, the poverty rate is deceptively low and the poverty density is high. Clustering methods are efficient instruments to classify small areas in similar groups regarding all aspectsof poverty and inequality and should be utilized to avoid confusion.Table 2.

This enablesgovernments to avoid extreme payments during budget allocation. Table 3 shows thebudget required to raise all members of the population above the correspondingpoverty line using estimates of poverty gap in different levels of disaggregation.The difference between two budget requirements is a measure of efficiency that government can gain from small area estimations. Applying an informed welfare policy with small area estimations and saving 27 per cent of budget, governmentcan take the opportunity to spend a significant share of the subsidy revenue ondevelopment programmes according to the regional requirement. Table 3. Required budget for eliminating poverty Level Required budget* (USD billion) County 1.00 Province 1.37 * Required budget to raise every one above poverty line = poverty gap x poverty line x population The discussion in this paper suggests that small area estimations are beneficial for setting a geographically targeted pro-poor policy. Although the resultsdo not indicate which geographical factors affect economic welfare, a spatial analysisusing detailed GIS information can be applied to obtain additional input ascomplementary information for policy implications. Reallocating a budget based on regional requirements not only alleviates poverty and inequality but also creates jobs and boosts production and income, which consequently raises living standards. Forinstance, geographical factors in rural areas, which cannot be addressed by currentpolicy, may be insufficient educational facilities, an inefficient health care system andlimited infrastructure. One reason behind this is that government has no control onintrahousehold allocations and usually in poor households, the allowance received by head of household is not spent on education, health and other needs of children. In contrast, in a growth-oriented policy, the government takes into account regionalfactors and household characteristics, and invests more efficiently. As a result,governmental bodies do not waste time and energy on redistributional activities, butinstead focus on reallocating budgets and setting regional policies. In short,policymakers may switch their focus from addressing \"poor people \" to \"poor areas \" (considering available information and policy instruments) in order to attain more accurate outcomes.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 146Generally speaking, the effective use of SAE can lead to fundamental changes in government interventions and development plans. This method isparticularly useful when a government faces a budget deficit and must rationalize indetail its expenditures. Visualizing welfare indicators in small areas can facilitateevidence-based policymaking and efficient use of scarce resources. The policyimplications of this paper are applicable to other countries that are similar to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Indonesia 's policy on energy subsidies is an extreme case in East Asia in which different households and different regions are disproportionatelybenefiting from the subsidies. The government has been struggling for a long time onwhether to free fuel prices or balance the subsidiary benefits among households andregions. Nevertheless, according to Bedi, and others (2007), many governmentagencies had never utilized SAE and poverty maps for setting polices despite the substantial variation in poverty and inequality among local areas. In fact, the study done for the World Bank indicates that poverty maps have influenced policymaking inseveral countries. In Sri Lanka, poverty incidence is highly correlated with access tothe market and the SAE technique has served as an essential tool for Samurdhi, thecountry 's main poverty alleviation programme, which is under the authority of the Samurdhi (or prosperity) Ministry. Through this programme, 113 of the poorest areas were identified as being target points as the ministry reformed its transfer programme. As another example, a simulation study by Elbers and others (2007) using data fromCambodia shows that by utilizing SAE for efforts aimed at alleviating poverty, specificareas can be pinpointed and targeted for a specific programme, resulting in a budgetthat is less than one-third of one for a comparable untargeted programme. Povertymaps from other countries in Asia, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal andViet Nam, show that there are large-scale discrepancies in depth and incidence of poverty among small geographic areas, but this information has been underutilized. The additional evidence from the Islamic Republic of Iran to the substantive literatureon poverty and inequality studies in developing countries reinforces the findings thatSAE is an efficient tool for evidence-based policymaking.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 147REFERENCES Akhavi, A.

Ekhwan bin Toriman* Paddy is the main food crop in Malaysia, but due to a low rate of productivity, the land area for paddy production is gradually decreasing. As a consequence, it is critically important to know the socio-economiccharacteristics of the paddy farmers and their linkage with agriculturalproductivity to ensure the sustainability of paddy farms as well as farmers ' livelihood. This study analyses the relationships between the paddy yieldsand the socio-economic characteristics of the farmers in the Integrated Agricultural Development Area (IADA), North-West Selangor, Malaysia. The data was collected through a survey. To analyse the data, this studyconducted cross-sectional multiple OLS regressions. The findings of thestudy revealed that several socio-economic and physical characteristicshad significant effects on paddy productivity in Malaysia. Based on thefindings, some policy recommendations and action plans have been proposed focusing on paddy productivity in relation to the socio- economic sustainability of the livelihood. The findings of the study areimportant for the policymakers and relevant agencies. JEL Q15, Q18.

INTRODUCTION The growing industrialization of Malaysia has meant that the agricultural sector 's share of the country 's gross domestic product (GDP) has been declining since 1975. In 1970, the contribution of agriculture to GDP was 30.8 per cent, which was the highest among all sectors. It fell to 22.7 per cent in 1975 and stood at 22.9 per cent and 20.8 per cent in 1980 and 1985, respectively, but still remained thetop sector contributing to GDP . In 1990, agriculture became the second largestsector, contributing 18.7 per cent to the national GDP . In 1995, the contribution ofagriculture to the national GDP further declined to 13.6 per cent, but it remained asthe second largest sector in the economy. The contribution of the sector continued to decline to 8.9 per cent and 8.2 per cent in 2000 and 2005, respectively. As the agriculture sector lost its importance to the national economy, services andmanufacturing sectors became the first and second highest contributing sectors,respectively, placing agriculture as the third engine of economic growth in the country. Land use for agricultural activities in Malaysia is declining due to the country 's rapid economic development. As a consequence, many land areas once used to grow crops are now used for housing, business, and industrial purposes. From 1960 until 2005, the land use for industrial crops increased while land use for food crops decreased. This implies that more and more agricultural land is beingused for growing industrial crops and that the importance of growing food crops is onthe decline. In terms of numbers, land use for food crops accounted for 31.5 per centof the total agricultural land in Malaysia, compared to 16.3 per cent in 2005. Amongthe industrial crops, palm oil accounted for the largest share of the total landutilization in the country. Agricultural land used by the palm oil sector has significantly increased over the last five decades from only 2.1 per cent of the total amount in 1960 to 63.4 per cent in 2005. This is an indication that palm oilproduction has been gaining in importance and contributing significantly to thenational economy. Yamada (2003) mentioned that the agriculture sector in Malaysia ischaracterized by a dualistic structure, consisting of large plantation companies, whichare professionally managed and focus on perennial crops, such as oil palm, rubber and cocoa, and small farmers, which are generally not well managed and concentrate their activities on cultivating food crops. Rice is the main staple food in Malaysia. There are 300,000 paddy farmers in the country, of which only 40 per cent of them are full-time farmers (Man and Sadiya,2009). According to a World Bank study cited by Pio Lopez (2007), 65 per cent offarms take up less than one hectare, and Malaysia is an inefficient producer of rice.The study noted that the price of locally produced rice was double that of imported rice. It was estimated that 74 per cent of paddy producers ' monthly income cameAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 163from income support measures, suggesting that the Malaysian paddy subsector is non-viable and non-sustainable. Government support for research and development,production and marketing in this subsector have taken many forms. Credit facilities,fertilizer subsidies, irrigation investment, guaranteed minimum price, income supportprogrammes, subsidized retail price as well as research and extension support(training and advisory services), amounting to billions of dollars over the past 50 years, have been a fiscal drain on the nation. Despite the massive fiscal outlays, rice production remains chronically inefficient with regards to meeting marketdemand. Given the continued decline in cultivated area, negligible gains inproductivity, continued increases in the cost of production and decreasingprofitability, rice production in Malaysia can be considered a sunset industry (PioLopez, 2007). The current record also shows a negative trend of land usage for paddy production. There are a total of 426,260 hectares of paddy planted area, and average yield is 3.5 tons per hectare (Malaysia, 2008). Singh and others (1996) pointed outthat the actual farm yields of rice in Malaysia varied from 3 to 5 tons per hectare,where potential yield is 7.2 tons. Pio Lopez (2007) noted that rice production inMalaysia was going to end due to the continued decline in the cultivated area,negligible gains in productivity, continued increases in the cost of production anddecreasing profitability. Jayawardane (1996) indicated that 90 per cent of total paddy productivity is contributed by labour, farm power, fertilizer and agro-chemicals, out of which 45 per cent is contributed by labour. The Third Malaysia Plan (Malaysia, 1976) reported that the incidence of poverty was 88 per cent among the rice farmers. The National Response Strategies(Malaysia, 2001) also reported that the poor are the most vulnerable population groupto climate change and that the hardcore poor tended to have a relatively large numberof household members and are involved in agricultural activities. While working in the Muda Agricultural Development Authority (MADA) area, Corner (1981) observed that off-farm employment should be expanded as part of an anti-poverty strategy. Shandand Chew (1983) conducted research in Kelantan, Malaysia and found that a largemajority of farmers had relied heavily on off-farm employment in order to attaina modest standard of living. An assessment of the socio-economic profile of farmersin Selangor, Malaysia, indicated that 81 per cent of the farmers were between 20 and 60 years old, and that 84 per cent of them had at a least primary education (TaniNet 2 nd Report, 2000). To remedy the above, elements of the Second National Agricultural Policy 1992-1997 (Malaysia, 1992) were revised for the Third National Agricultural Policy1998-2010 (Malaysia, 1998), which envisioned the sustainable development ofAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 164a dynamic agricultural sector focusing on the market-led, commercialized, efficient and competitive growth of agriculture. The principal aim of the Third NationalAgricultural Policy was to maximize the income of the stakeholders through optimalutilization of resources. In addition to actual production, several socio-economic characteristics as well as the physical assets must be accounted for when measuring productivitypertaining to agricultural activities. Moreover, variables that may affect productivity, such as climate change, must also be considered by officials when setting agricultural policies. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the effects of the socio-economiccharacteristics of farmers on the productivity of the paddy and to discuss the relevantpolicy implications. II. BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY AREA The agricultural history of the study area started before 1930. An irrigation controlled area was built at Pancang Bedena in 1932 and 15,000 acres of land wasconverted to a rice field, with planting starting in this area in 1936. The yield was very low at that time due to a water shortage, and, so, a barrage at the Tengi River was built the same year. Since 1948, a number of concrete waterways have been built inthe area. In 1962, double planting of paddy per year was introduced in the area anda pump house was built in Began Terap to provide sufficient water in remote landareas in the south. By 1966, all of the paddy areas in the study area were beingplanted twice yearly. In 1978, Projek Barat Laut Selangor (PBLS) was established to help boost productivity, upgrade and improve the infrastructure of the agricultural plots, and look after the welfare of the farmers. In 1982, planting by direct seedingwas introduced in this area. Before it was changed to \"North West Selangor Integrated Agricultural Development Project \" (IADP), it was called \"Tanjung Karang Drainage Scheme \". In 1985 IADP was completed at a cost of $87 million, financed through a World Bank loan. This project focused on improving irrigation infrastructure for rice intensification. Recently, the name of IADP has been changed to \"Integrated Agricultural Development Area \" (IADA). Now the IADA in North-West Selangor consists of agricultural land area of the IADA is 100,000hectare (ha), with 55,000 ha used for palm oil, 20,000 ha for coconut, 5,000 ha forfruits and vegetables and 20,000 ha for paddy. This 20,000 ha for the paddy area contains a river, a drainage system, and rural roads. The total paddy producible area is 18,638 ha, and currently paddy is planted on 18,355 ha. Total paddy irrigated areais 18,980 ha, with the additional 625 ha being used for drainage. There are 10,300Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 165paddy farmers and 30,000 producers of other crops. The total size of the agricultural community is 50,000. III. DATA AND METHODOLOGY As mentioned above, the productivity of crops is determined by many socio- economic and physical factors. To ascertain the effects of these factors, this studymostly relied on primary data from a research project entitled \"The economics of climate change: Economic dimensions of climate change, impacts and adaptationpractices in agriculture sector: Case of paddy sector in Malaysia \", conducted by the Institute for Environment and Development (LESTARI) of the National University of Malaysia (UKM) (Alam and others, 2010a). Data for this project were collectedthrough a sample survey of paddy producing farmers in the eight sections of theIntegrated Agricultural Development Area (IADA) of North-West Selangor, Malaysia.The target group of the survey was paddy producing farmers. The survey wasa structured questionnaire taken by regular enumerators of the IADA authority under the direct supervision of IADA officials. The population size of the area was 10,300 while the sample for the study consisted of 198 respondents proportionatelydistributed among the eight areas based on the size of the irrigated land area. The198 households covered 577.53 ha of paddy areas. The sample within the area isselected randomly. Details of socio-economic profiles of the respondents areavailable at Alam and others (2010a, 2010b). While analysing the relationship between socio-economic characteristics of farmers and agricultural yield, this study conducted cross sectional-multiple OLS regressions based on the survey data. To avoid the problem of heteroskedasticity,further regression was conducted by the \"White Heteroskedasticity - Consistent Standard Errors and Covariance \" method by using EViews econometric software. The econometric model used in this study avoided the direct inputs variables that determine the crop yield, such as labour hours, use of pesticides, use offertilizers and use of irrigation. Instead, it assumes that all of the direct input factors are exogenous and constant based on the view that the government provides these facilities in fixed quantities, which very few farmers exceed. In this model,factors relevant to socio-economic characteristics of farmers (W 1- W11), physical characteristics of the farm (W12- W22), and farmers ' knowledge about relevant current issues, such as climate change (W23), are considered to determine its relationship with the yield of paddy production.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 166Pi = + 1W1i + 2W2i + 3W3i + 21W21i + 22W22i + 23W23i+ Here, Pi = Yield of paddy production W1i = Race of the farmer (dummy variable where Malay = 1, Other = 0) W2i = Gender of farmer (dummy variable where Male = 1, Other = 0) W3i = Age of the farmer W4i = Secondary occupation (dummy variable where Having secondary occupation = 1, No secondary occupation = 0) W5i = Tertiary education (dummy variable where Having tertiary education = 1, Other = 0) W6i = Primary education (dummy variable where Having primary education = 1, Other = 0) W7i = Secondary education (dummy variable where Having secondary education = 1, Other = 0) W8i = Family size (number of family members) W9i = Non-agriculture to agricultural income ratio W10i = Number of available vehicle W11i = Distance between home and field W12i = Farm size (size of paddy cultivated area) W13i= Mixed ownership of land (dummy variable where Both own and rent land Use = 1, Other = 0) W14i = Own land (dummy variable where Own land use = 1, Other = 0) W15i = Number of available machineries W16i = Locality Sawah Simpadan (dummy variable where Sawah Simpadan = 1, Other = 0) W17i = Locality Sekinchan (dummy variable where Sekinchan = 1, Other = 0)Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 167W18i = Locality Sg.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS The multiple regression based on the socio-economic characteristics of farmers on yield of paddy shows mixed results. The results differ based on normaloutput and heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors and covariance (the White Test for heteroskedasticity) output. For reporting purposes both data are reported, but for analysis and drawing inferences only the heteroskedasticity adjusted resultsare considered here. In both cases, the R 2 is 0.44, which means that the independent variables explain 44 per cent of the dependent variable. As explained earlier, thismodel assumes the main input variables that determine yields of paddy areexogenous due to an almost fixed value for all observations. As these exogenous variables highly determine the dependent variable, excluding them in the model would result in a moderate value of R 2. The demographic data, including, among other factors, ethnicity, gender and age, are considered in terms of labour quality for the yield of production. The resultshows that race has significant impacts on productivity. In the dummy variable,Malay farmers are classified as 1 and Chinese farmers are classified as 0. Thecoefficient of the regression result shows a significant negative relationship, a 1 per cent significance level, between the race of the farmers and productivity, which means that the productivity of Malay farmers is lower than that of Chinese farmers.The elasticity shows -0.4 for Malay farmers with regard to paddy yield.

The availability of secondary occupations for the farmers has a significant negative impact, a 7 per cent significance level, on paddy yield. For a 1 per centincrease in secondary occupations among farmers, the yield of paddy productiondecreases by 0.02 per cent. This variable indicates that the quality of labour input, interms of concentration or effort and managing enough time for the agriculturalpurposes, is required for increasing the yield.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 169The education level of the farmer plays a major role in the yield of agricultural output. If a farmer has a tertiary education, there is no significant impact on thepaddy yield, but for those with primary and secondary educations, the impacts onpaddy yield are significant, with significance levels of 8 per cent and 4 per cent,respectively. Farmers need a basic level of education to understand and read relevantTable 2.

The elasticity of primary and secondary educated farmers on paddy yield is 0.07 and 0.08,respectively. This means that a 1 per cent increase in primary level-educated farmersleads to a 0.07 per cent increase in paddy yield, and a 1 per cent increase insecondary level-educated farmers leads to 0.08 per cent increase in paddy yield. The size of a family or number of family members in terms of quantity of labour has no significant impact on paddy yields. This finding is consistent with the initial assumption that labour is an exogenous factor in the model, meaning that the same amount of labour is provided by all farmers. Consequently, increased labourinputs provided by a large family have no significant effects on yield. Moreover,a small family tends to cover required labour needs by hiring workers and thus theimpact of labour is on profitability rather than on productivity. The ratio of non-agriculture to agricultural income has significant negative impacts, at 3 per cent significance level, on paddy yields. If farmers have more non- agricultural income compared to agricultural income, the productivity of paddy declines due to the less attention farmers provide to agricultural work. If the ratioincreases by 1 per cent, the yield of paddy productivity declines by 0.01 per cent. The distance between the paddy field and home and the number of available vehicles has no significant impact on paddy yield. Farmers usually live very close totheir fields, and have enough vehicles on hand to reach the fields when necessary. Asa consequence, these factors have no significant impacts on paddy yield. The farm level production or individual farmer level production has no significant impacts on productivity. Due to the use of almost constant rates of inputs by farmers, provided by government which is considered as exogenous variables in the model, the yields of farms or individual farmers have no significant difference. Theownership of the land also has no significant impacts on yield of paddy production.However, both the farm size and ownership criteria have impacts on the profitabilityrate as opposed to the productivity rate. The available number of machines for carrying out agricultural activities has significant impacts on yield productivity of paddy. This is an indicator of using technology and timing of technology usage. At a 4 per cent significant level, it shows that the total number of machines available to the farmer or farm has significantimpacts on paddy yield. A 1 per cent increase in the number of machines leads toa 0.06 per cent increase in the productivity of the paddy. The productivity of paddy among the eight areas of IADA varies. Some areas of the IADA have statistically significant impacts on the yield. One of them isAsia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 171Sg. Burong which is significant at 7 per cent. The area of Sekinchan is not statistically significant, but the productivity of this area is very high. The variation incrops from area to area results from the variation in land fertility and climate-relatedfactors, such as the land moisture level, the rate of rainfall and temperature rates. The knowledge of farmers about recent issues, such as awareness about climate change, has no significant impacts on yield of paddy, because thisinformation is readily available to everybody. Moreover, the IADA authority provides the information, controls and monitors all relevant issues of paddy production in this locality. Several socio-economic variables of the farming community that have statistically significant relationships with paddy yield change due to declining paddyproductivity. Farmers with secondary occupations have negative relationships withyield. When yields decline, the secondary occupations of farmers increase further.Moreover, education has a positive relationship with yield, as yield decreases, the number of educated farmers declines. In addition, the ratio of non-agricultural income to agricultural income will increase more in the future as yields decline due toclimate change. The socio-economic characteristics of the farming community arechanging and will change even more depending on the intensity of the adverse effectsstemming from climate change. Physical characteristics of farms that have significant impacts on paddy yield carry important implications to commercial farms, for instance, will likely benefit morefrom the positive relationship between machinery and productivity than individual farmers because they are in a better position to purchase new machines. Furthermore, few localities have positive relationships with yields that lead to anincrease in the demand for land in these areas. Due to differentiations in paddyproductivity among geographical areas, income inequality among the farmers indifferent areas is increasing. V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS As shown in the study, several socio-economic and physical characteristics of farmers have significant impacts on paddy productivity. One characteristic in particular is race. The productivity of Malay farmers compared with Chinese farmersis significantly low, with the elasticity at -0.4 in terms of paddy yield between the twogroups. The option of pursuing a secondary occupation for farmers has significantnegative impacts on paddy yield. If the number of farmers pursuing secondaryoccupations increases 1 per cent, the yield of paddy production decreases by 0.02 per cent. The level of education also has significant impacts on paddy yield.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 2011 172A 1 per cent increase in farmers having a primary level education results in a 0.07 per cent increase in paddy yield, and 1 per cent increase in farmers having a secondarylevel education raises paddy yield 0.08 per cent. The ratio of non-agriculture toagricultural income has significant negative impacts on paddy yield. If the ratioincreases by 1 per cent, the yield of paddy productivity declines by 0.01 per cent.Moreover, examples of physical farm characteristics that have significant impacts on paddy yield are technology and geographical position. A 1 per cent increase in the number of farm machines leads to a 0.06 per cent increase in the productivity of thepaddy. Among the areas, Sg. Burong shows positive impacts on yield where theelasticity value is 0.02. Based on the findings, there are several policy implications. Currently, the Government allocates a certain amount of land for Malay farmers even though theirproductivity is lower than that of other ethnic groups. It is also a threat for achieving self-sufficiency level of paddy production at the national level. At the same time, due to the high productivity of Chinese farmers, allotting more land to them will createa social imbalance. Therefore, the Government should initiate policies that aim tohelp Malay farmers boost their productivity through specific training or educationprogrammes, awareness creation programmes or extra incentive programmes. Production practices are an important element in government policy. Currently, the Government specifies certain areas for paddy production. Thisapproach inhibits farmers who tend to select the crops they produce of their own choosing and results in higher land degradation due to mono crop production. In this area, based on soil suitability, crop rotation and crop variety are needed to maintainland fertility and reduce the risk of climate change. The Government should also paymore attention to other relevant factors, such as agricultural wages, land leasingsystems and rates and maximum farm size. These factors are very important for thesustainability of small farmers, poverty reduction and reducing income inequality and a positive effort directed at them would increase overall productivity to achieve self-sufficiency or close to the self-sufficiency level in rice production to ensurenational food security.Asia-Pacific Development Journal Vol. 18, No. 1, June 173REFERENCES Alam, M.M., Chamhuri Siwar and M.E.
