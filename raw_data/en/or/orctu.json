INSIDE EDITOR'S LETTER Vancouver artist Joe Average\u2014who graces our cover along with a painting from his \"Palm Tree Study\" series\u2014saidsomething during our interview that stuck with me: \" hiv saved my life in that I decided to make art my life.\" (Hepainted the Palm Tree series when he desperately needed avacation but wasn't well enough and couldn't afford to getaway.) Facing his own mortality provoked Joe to spend histime doing \"something I like\"\u2014so he took a risk, picked uphis paintbrush and turned a hobby into his livelihood. The rest is history. Today, Joe's art\u2014with its bold, graphic lines and vibrant, playful imagery\u2014is instantly rec-ognizable to his fellow Canadians as well as to people allover the world, many of whom first caught a glimpse of histalent at the 1996 International aids Conference in Vancou- ver. Joe created the image for the conference logo, whichput him on the map. He's won numerous awards and hiswork has been compared to that of the late Keith Haring,the famous American pop artist who also had hiv. But Joe hasn't painted in five years. Managing his health, he said, has become a full-time job and there's notime or space in his life to produce art. His health has be-come his most challenging masterpiece to date. Although hivinspired Joe to make art his life, it's now forced him to make his life his art. And there's somethingvery profound in that for each of us. Though hivdisease is largely about labs, numbers and science, managing yourlife with hivdisease is, ultimately, an art unto itself. With The Positive Side , we hope to provide you with some tools for creating your very own masterpiece. In thisissue: Dietitian Doug Cook serves up nutrition tips forinsulin resistance.

I waited patiently\u2014customers first, journalists second!This particular young woman haddropped in to ask about the safety ofan herbal supplement she wasconsidering. \"It's good you asked,\"Somani told her, because, he said,supplements can sometimes interactwith medications. After checking hermeds lineup, Somani assured thewoman that it should be fine. But, hesaid, \"If you start taking largerdosages of the supplement, come backand let me double-check.\" This was just the sort of thing I'd come to interview Somani about:Should every pharmacist know aboutdrug/herbal interactions? While itmakes for more information to keep ontop of, Somani says it's just part of hisseveral treatment options that are all medically sound,\" says Cara Hills ofthe Northern Alberta hiv Program. \"The final decision often depends onpracticalities, such as whether thereare food restrictions. As a pharmacist,I'm often able to spend a lot more timeon those issues than a specialist can.People can then go back to their doc-tors with a much clearer sense of theirpreferences.\" Easy-access treatment information. Your pharmacist is proba- bly your best bet for infoand tips on meds manage- ment. Jeff Kapler, an hiv specialty pharmacist in Calgary, says specialtypharmacists can \"help by teachingpeople about and treatment op-tions\u2014and we're very accessible.\"Kathryn Slayter, clinical pharmacistspecialist at Queen Elizabeth II HealthSciences Centre in Halifax, secondsthat notion. \"People can call me anytime. We don't say, 'Here are your pills,see you later'\u2014we chat about how towork your pills into a busy day, orwhatever it is people need.\" When yourdoc's day is booked, your pharmacistcan be the most accessible part of yourhealth care team. \"We always givepeople private, one-on-one time wherethey can discuss anything regardingmedication,\" says Linda Akagi of St.Paul's Hospital Outpatient Pharmacy inVancouver. And quick questions canoften get answered right away. Advice on avoiding drug interactions. Medications can affect each other, sometimes ina harmful way\u2014\"and that includes complementary and alterna-tive medicine ( cam) as well as over-the counter products,\" Kathryn Slaytersays. \"My one rule with cam is that it not interfere with haart or add toxic- ity.\" Your pharmacist is your best betfor checking up on interactions\u2014stayon the lookout by letting them knoweverything you take. Also, sticking with a single pharmacist keeps it allunder one roof, where it's easier toflag potential problems.job: \"Pharmacy is not just lick 'n' stick the labels, count 'n' pour the pills. It'sabout the patients, not the pills.\" After speaking with Somani and four other pharmacists who alsospecialize in hivcare, my suspicions were confirmed: Pharmacists are theunsung heroes of hivcare\u2014a valuable and often-untapped resource forpeople with hiv/aids (phas). Here are seven sorts of good pharma dharma you can get from thatprofessional behind the counter: Help choosing a drug combination. When starting or switch- ing highly active antiretro-viral therapy ( haart ), it's tough to narrow down all the options.While the final choice is up to you andyour doctor, pharmacists are readyand willing to pitch in. \"There may be 4 THE POSITIVE SIDE Spring/Summer 2005 PHOTO: PHOTOS.COM ThePharmacist List reasons to get to know the person behind the counter by Derek Thaczuk 7 1 3 2Advocating for your needs. We phas don't always see the snarl of rules andregulations that makes it hard to get the drugs we need, thoughwe may be all-too-painfully aware ofthe end result when a prescriptioncan't be filled. Pharmacists who knowthe consequences of missed dosesmay be willing to become bulldogs,tackling red tape on their patients'behalf. \"We've handled negotiationswith insurance companies wherethere Akagi says. \"When[ pcp-fighting Dapsone the Canadian market[for marketing reasons], the wholeprocess of getting it became a hugehassle. We explained the problems to a provincial committee that agreedto cover it, but they might not haveknown how bad the situation was if [pharmacists] hadn't laid it out for them.\" Derek Thaczuk has worked and volunteered within the hivcommunity for 10 years. His obsessions includehealth literacy, making research andinformation accessible, and penguins. He is now a self-employed medical writerand consultant whose website is atwww.readablewriting.ca.Studies have shown that phas who work closely with their pharmaciststand a better chance of meeting ad-herence goals and, therefore, success-ful therapy. A study published in AIDS Care (May 2004 ) showed that patients were much more likely to take all theirmeds when they used a clinic phar-macy that offered personal support.\"This study demonstrates the positiveimpact of the pharmacist in patientcare,\" says study co-investigator LindaAkagi. \"It showed that patients with a higher level of involvement with apharmacist were more likely to beadherent to their meds and keep their hivsuppressed.\" In fact, the well-sup- ported patients were 1.5times more likely to maintain an undetectableviral load than those \"off-site.\" (Formore on adherence, see \"The Impor-tance of Being Adherent,\" The Positive Side, fall/winter 2004 .) Coverage costs. Meds don't come cheap, and coverage plans canleave a lot uncovered. \"I often see patients for whom the highcost of meds is a barrier to their treat-ment,\" Somani says. \"I always try tofind ways to work around financialconstraints to get people the drugsthey need.\" Even if sometimes thatmeans braving a tangle of red tape.Tips on how to deal with side effects. Pharmacists often have useful tips for avoiding ormanaging side effects. \"Some people are lucky and hardlyskip a beat when they start newmeds,\" Jeff Kapler says. \"Others mayhave mild or serious adverse effects.\"Pharmacists can often suggest solu-tions, such as over-the-counter \"If we problems,\" Kapler work with the physician andpatient to pick alternate medications.\" Pharmacists can also shed some perspective on the appalling lists of\"possible\" side effects of medications.\"When people look at all the listed sideeffects and say, 'Oh my God,' we canallay some of those fears by talkingwith them,\" Kapler says. \"By drawingon our experience with our otherpatients, we can give people that real-life perspective.\" Adherence assistance. Taking all your meds ontime every day can be atough pill to swallow.Everybody has challenges, whether it's the demands of a busyschedule, drug or alcohol use, or justtrouble remembering. Pharmacistscan help brainstorm creative ways todeal with demanding timetables.One of Somani's patients had a verycomplex regimen\u2014 13different drugs for hiv, heart disease and neuropathy. He found it too difficult to manage andkeep track of them all. That's whereSomani stepped in: \"I offered him aDosettes program, where we prepack-aged all his meds in a weekly pill box,divided and labeled by day and time.That worked extremely well for him\u2014it took out the guesswork and gave himtime to do things besides worryingabout when to take his meds.\" Adherence also has to do with atti- tude. \"Some people dislike takingmeds because they're sick,\" Jeff Kapler says. \"Itry to make them feel more positive\u2014that taking their meds is a way to takecontrol of their disease. I think peoplefeel better when they're empowered.\"PHA Prescription 4 5 6 7 When asked, \"What could your patients do to get the most out of you?\" our friendly pharma-cists filled out the following 'script: GDemand the best. \"If possible, pick a pharmacy that specializes in HIVthat has a full-time pharmacist you can get to know,\"Zahid Somani says. Ask your doc or ASO for suggestions. GDon't wait until zero hour. It may not be pos- sible to arrange a refill right away. Call whileyou've got at least a few days of meds left. GAsk questions. \"We don't judge people's life situations, so if you have questions aboutanything related to your health, go ahead andask!\" Jeff Kapler says. \"If you have all theinformation, you can make better decisions.\" GBrown-bag it. Every so often, bring in all your pills and bottles\u2014including supplements and over-the-counter drugs\u2014so your pharmacist can double-check for interactions. It's good todo this whenever your meds change. GBe honest. \"I don't want people to feel they have to lie about their adherence for fear ofgetting scolded,\" Kathryn Slayter says. If cir-cumstances have made it tough to take yourpills, say so\u2014between you and your pharma-cist, you may come up with a solution youhadn't thought of on your own. GPlan ahead if you're moving , especially between provinces. Linda Akagi says thatpeople are often surprised to find that cover-age varies between provinces\u2014and that it maytake months before coverage kicks in. If thegrass looks greener elsewhere, check into drugplans to ensure continuous coverage. (Call CATIE at 1.800.263.1638 for info on provincial coverage plans.)\"My art classes immediately come to mind. In 1994 , I saw an ad for the Art Gallery ofOntario's drawingclasses entitled,'Drawing for theAbsolute and Ter- rified Beginner.' I hated artin school and decided to put the galleryto the test. In retrospect, perhaps thiswas a metaphor for the virus\u2014what Icould not control in my body I couldachieve with my mind . . . anything toregain some sense of control. \"I did two sessions of beginner drawing until my teacher insisted that I was ready to 'graduate' to paint-ing . . . and I love it!

What Ifeel helps this process is having teach-ers who totally support everything youproduce. You can be dissatisfied butthey always find positive aspects ofthe work. Maybe in life we need tosurround ourselves with these typesof individuals, too. \"Life is tough enough without adding the stress of health issueswhile trying to run a household andraise a family.

Those times whenmy concentration is so focused are absolutely exhilarating\u2014it almostfeels like an out-of-body experience,like the paint brush is moving on itsown.

And not necessarily inthat order\u2014it depends on my mood. \"Peripheral neuropathy: I took Videx (ddI) during my first antiretro-viral treatment.

After all, there's no harm in treating oneself kindly. \"Access to quality ther- apeutic marijuana should be a top priority in helping to improve the quality of life of phas.

Ipamper and spoil them outrageously,but we all enjoy it.\" GAlexander Peters, 60, Ottawaa dietitian in a medical clinic that serves many people with hiv/aids (phas), I get a lot of referrals for insulin resistance\u2014a metabolic complicationassociated with hivdisease and its treatment. In fact, close to 50% of my referrals are for insulin resistance,among other metabolic disorders.Understanding metabolic disorders isimportant for phas because these com- plications may have a negative impacton quality of life, interfere with adher-ence to antiretroviral therapy and ex-acerbate long-term health problems. The Goods on Glucose The body requires sugar, or glu- cose, to provide energy for all of itsfunctions. Glucose is one fuel that yourbody cannot do without. The glucosethat enters your blood comes mainlyfrom the digestion of carbohydrates infoods such as fruits, vegetables, bread,cereal, pasta, rice, milk and otherdairy products. Normally, the hor-mone insulin helps glucose enter yourcells, providing food energy. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body's cells do not respondproperly to the hormone and cannottake up glucose, which then builds upin the bloodstream. The pancreas,which produces insulin, responds byproducing extra insulin to help movethe glucose into the cell. If the bodycannot produce enough insulin or thecells do not respond to it efficiently,the result is hyperglycemia, or highblood sugar. Ultimately, this can leadto diabetes mellitus (type 2), a con-dition characterized by persistent hyperglycemia. Keep Your Eyes on PIs Before highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) became available, glucose abnormalities were uncom-mon among phas. But, ever since the introduction of protease inhibitors( pis), insulin resistance and hyper- glycemia continue to be reported inpeople on pi-containing drug regimens (the nucleoside analogue d 4T is also emerging as a problem). It is esti-mated that some degree of insulinresistance affects about one half ofpeople taking pis. Given that some degree of insulin resistance may occur when taking pis,the goal is to manage any blood glu- cose abnormalities that may developwhile reducing your risk of diabetes. Inmany cases, blood glucose problemscan be managed by lifestyle changesand diet modifications. Sometimesyour doctor may switch your antiretro-virals and/or prescribe antidiabeticdrugs to control blood glucose levels. Weighing In Maintaining a healthy weight (and losing weight if necessary) is recom-mended to help prevent or manageinsulin resistance. Having excess ab-dominal fat and a large waist is con-sidered a risk factor for developinginsulin resistance. A waist circumfer-ence greater than 102cm (40inches) for men and greater than 88cm (34.5 inches) for women is considered highrisk. The best way to lose or maintainyour weight is with exercise and ahealthy diet. Exercise can help you lose weight by burning calories, but it also helps byclearing glucose from your blood with-out the help of insulin. Exercise alsohelps to maintain muscle, and musclegives your body something to store theextra blood sugar in. A combination ofcardio/aerobic and weight resistancetraining is best to help burn caloriesand build muscle. If carrying extraweight is not an issue for you, buildingmuscle is still beneficial. (For more infoon exercise, see \"Let's Get Physical,\"page 18.) Do or Diet The Canadian Diabetes Association (www.diabetes.ca) recommends a dietthat includes a balance of protein, fatand carbohydrate. The type of carbo-hydrate may be more important thanthe amount. Starchy carbs (such as100% whole wheat/grain breads and products, rice, pasta, yams, corn andbeans) and carbs from dairy foods(such as milk, cheese and yogurt) aredigested more slowly and stimulateless insulin production, so it's better tochoose these carbs more often. Limitcarbs that are typically added to foodfor flavour (such as sugars and syrups)as well as sweetened beverages andbaked goods made with refined flour. 8 THE POSITIVE SIDE Spring/Summer 2005 ILLUSTRATIONS: BEVERLY DEUTSCHNUTRITION LaDolceVita The sweet and lowdown on blood glucose levels by Doug Cook AsThe following nutrition recommen- dations can help you optimize yourefforts in preventing and managing in-sulin resistance and have been consis-tently shown to be your best defense. Figure Out Fats The quality of the fat in your diet can influence insulin resistance overthe long term. Studies have shown alink between increased insulin resist-ance and a high intake trans fats\u2014while the healthierpolyunsaturated, omega- 3and mono- unsaturated fats are associated with a lower risk of insulin resistance.Reduce saturated and trans fats by choosing lean meats, skinlesschicken and low-fat dairy, and limitingbaked, fried and breaded foods. Readfood labels and try to limit foods with \"hydrogenated\" oils. Emphasizehealthier, monounsaturated fats byusing canola or olive oil in cooking andbaking, and eating nuts and seeds andavocado. The best sources of omega- 3 fats are found in ground flax, soyproducts and fish. 9 Spring/Summer 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEFill Up on Fibre Dietary fibre has been shown toimprove both insulin sensitivityand blood glucose levels. Thereare two types of fibre\u2014insolubleand soluble\u2014which occur togetherin foods. Both are important forhealth, but soluble fibre has beenshown to slow down the digestion of carbohydrate in food and, therefore,the rate at which digested carbohy-drate (glucose) enters the bloodstream.Less insulin is released and the resultis a lower post-meal blood glucoselevel, which helps to lessen the amountof insulin required and will help tolower your risk of insulin resistanceand progression to diabetes. Aim for5-10 grams per day of soluble fibre from oat bran, psyllium, guar gum andpectin. (To help you reach this goal,look for the soluble fibre content onfood labels. If you're getting at least 5 servings of fruits and veggies and morethan 5servings of 100% whole grain breads and products per day, you'lleasily get 5grams of soluble fibre.) Good food sources of soluble fibre arebarley, prunes, Metamucil, cold cereals(Quaker Oat Squares, Quaker CornBran, with Psyllium, Kashi),ground flax seed, low-fat popcorn, oatbran, oatmeal, apples, oranges andmany other fruits and veggies. Dish It Out To help control the amount of glu- cose absorbed by the digestion of car-bohydrate, it's important to managethe amount of carbohydrate you eat ateach meal and distribute it evenly overthe course of the day. Try to eatsmaller, more frequent meals. Aim tohave 3meals and 2-3 snacks each day, eating a variety of foods, with50% of your plate comprised of veg- gies, 25% starch/carbohydrate and 25% protein. Supplements Population studies (in which large groups of people are followed to seewhat kinds of foods they're eating andwhether or not they develop certaindiseases) have found associations be-tween certain nutrients in food and alower risk of insulin resistance anddiabetes. Studies that have used sup- plements have not obtained the sameresults. This may be because the nutri-ents found in food work together, andsimply supplementing with a vitaminor mineral on its own doesn't work in the same way. It's always best to get your nutrients from minimallyprocessed whole foods. The Sweet Hereafter While the exact causes of insulin resistance are not known, makinghealthier lifestyle choices is still animportant first step in preventing andmanaging this complication. For phas on haart , regular blood glucose moni- toring (every 3-4months) as part of your blood work is important to detectany changes before they progress to apotentially worse condition. If left un-treated, high blood sugar can lead to awide range of long-term health prob-lems, including kidney dysfunction,retina damage leading to blindness,nerve damage, erectile dysfunction andpregnancy complications. As well,chronic high blood sugar can con-tribute to blood vessel damage andcardiovascular disease, including heartattacks and stroke. Diagnosing blood glucose abnor- malities is usually done through thefollowing tests: Gfasting blood glucose \u2014blood sugar is measured after an 8-hour fast, with no food or beveragesexcept water Goral glucose tolerance test( OGTT )\u2014blood sugar is measured after an 8-hour fast, then you drink a sugar solution and blood sugar ismeasured every 30minutes for two hours to see if blood glucose levelsrise and fall normallyBy working with your health care providers and linking up with supportresources for diet and exercise, youcan take control in preventing andmanaging the development of long-term insulin-related complications.

Normal: GYour body makes enough insulin anduses it well. GA fasting blood glucose test result would be4.0-6.0 mmol.Impaired fasting glucose ( IFG): GYour body isn't using the insulin it produceswell and insulin resistance is present, result-ing in hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar. GA fasting blood glucose test result would beslightly high at 6.1-6.9 mmol.Diabetes mellitus: GThere isn't enough insulin being made by yourbody and you can't use glucose for energy. GThis is determined by a fasting blood glucosetest with a result 7 .0 mmol or higher, or aglucose result over 11.1 mmol after an OGTT . GDiabetes can also be diagnosed with anyblood glucose level over 11.1 mmol, if accom-panied by diabetes symptoms such asfrequent urination, unexplained weight loss,fatigue, and increased hunger and thirst. JOE AVERAGE: I was diagnosed in 1985 at age 27,but I'm 99% sure I contracted hivwhen I was 25.When I asked the doctor what it meant, he said: \"You could last sixmonths, you could last a year, five years, 10years or forever ... we just don't know.\" And I said: \"I'll choose for-ever.\" I'd known a few people who were living with aids or had died from it, and one thing I figured out, just fromwatching people, is that if I let it take over my life it would.So I decided to live as normally as possible. About three years later, I was working a crappy job and was let go. I thought, \"If I've only got six months to live, doI want to spend it collecting unemployment insurance orwelfare, or do I want to spend it doing something I like?\" Idecided to make a stab at living off of art. Art was some-thing I'd done since I was a kid but had never taken seri-ously. It was a hobby, not a way to make a living. I thought of it as urban camping: If I found myself alone in the middle of the woods, I'd figure out how to survive.So I took that approach and started making art and havinglittle shows in my apartment.

And since then you've been living off your art? average: Yeah. But I haven't painted for the past five years. Someone asked me when I decided to stop painting. Ididn't decide to stop painting\u2014things just got so intense.My mind was so full. At one point I had timers everywherebecause I had to take some drugs every two hours withfood and some every two hours without food. It was likeair-traffic control. My life became so complicated that there wasn't a clear area in my mind. Sketching is an organic process. Mybrain became so focused on surviving that the naturalprocess of sketching kind of screeched to a halt. It's hardto be inspired when you're dealing with life and deathstuff, horrific side effects and fear. Not painting has lowered my self-esteem and hurt me financially. I had the foresight when I had chunks of money to produce lithographs, limited edition prints ofmy stuff, which is what's been keeping me alive. PHOTOGRAPH: \u00a9 JAMIEGRIFFITHS.COM 2005NOTNOTYOURYOURAVERAVERAGEGEJOEJOENOTYOURAVERAGEJOEYou've donated a lot of your art to charity. average: As a kid I used to watch telethons and I always wanted to make donations like the adults. When I found outthat I could donate a piece of art and it would generatemoney, it became my way of helping. It's a win-win situa-tion\u2014I get to help people and people get to see my art. Idonate mostly to aids charities and stuff involving children. The canvases fetch a lot of money and the prints usuallyraise about twice their value, which is a great feeling. Do you think your art has helped raise awareness about aids ? average: Art is open to interpretation, that's the beauty of it. I've been invited to many elementary schools where theteachers have the kids study my art. Kids are so wonder-ful! I've left classrooms after two hours and the kids weresaying, \"We're coming to the aids Walk this year, Joe!\" I talk openly with them about it. I did a few images about aids\u2014one called My Thinking Cap (Life with HIV)and one called Ray of Hope \u2014when I first started the cocktail because I wanted that out of me alittle bit. For the most part though, my images aren't somuch aids-related\u2014they're more about how the child in me wants to see the world: happy and with love. There isso much communication with colour. Over the years I'velearned how much of a language colour is. Colour createsjoy in me and it creates joy in other people. There's a little thing I'm very proud of. For me, it's a reason to keep going with art. I've had parents come up tome and thank me. They say that when their child is cry-ing, they've figured out that the only thing to make themstop is to carry them over to my painting or print and holdthem up in front of it. And the child stops crying. I'vesomehow managed to communicate not only to parentsbut to babies. What's your favourite piece? average: That's like asking a parent which is their favourite child. There are so many for so many different reasons. THE KITCHEN SINK Let's hear a bit about your treatment history. average: I've never been hospitalised. I went for six or seven years on no drugs, and then my doctor suggested azt\u2014it was the only thing there was back then. But every- body I knew who was on aztwas dropping like flies, so I said \"no thank you.\" In the early ' 90s, someone came up to me and asked how much I weighed. They said I lookedlike a skeleton. I'd dropped down to about 115pounds. It actually timed out kind of nicely because it was rightaround the time when the first cocktail came out. I said,\" ok, I guess this is the time,\" and I went on azt, 3tcand d4T, and it helped. I've been on cocktails ever since. How many different combinations have you been on? average: Well, I won't say everything, but everything my body can tolerate. I became resistant to almost everything about two years ago. My cd4count was hovering between 50and 100. And 11 Spring/Summer 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEALL IMAGES ARE REPRODUCED WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE ARTIST \u00a9 JOE AVERAGE INC. 2005 I did a self-portrait, Me . I was going through a lot\u2014the side effects were intense, I'd just healed from a broken collarbone, I had to havesurgery because cysts had developed on my penis. It was very traumatic.So I sat down and did this drawing of myself because if there was one moreblow I was just going to crumble. I kind of overdrew the lines that I knewhad started to weather themselves into my face, like a road map of myjourney. Then I drew out from the wear marks to complete my head. I did itas stained glass to create that sort of fragile feeling. That was a self-portrait of me ready to crumble. It was my therapy at the time. my viral load was off the chart. We were waiting for a new drug called T- 20to come in. It's very expensive and it took some time to get it. At one point my doctor pulled me offeverything because the T- 20has to be taken in combina- tion with other drugs, and if I'd stayed on all the drugs Iwould have become resistant to them all and the T- 20 would have been useless. So he pulled me off everythingfor about six months and we just waited. In September2003 the T- 20finally came in. I've been on it ever since. What happened when you were off all the meds? average: I was very anemic, but fortunately I didn't get anything. I stayed very careful. I was like the boy in theplastic bubble, without the bubble. I avoided going placesand shaking hands with people. I was really wary to go tofunctions or benefits that I usually go to. If I had to go, Iwore a mask and latex gloves. I basically cut myself offfrom everything. What other hivmeds do you take with the T-20? average: I'll get my little pillbox. 4T, 3tc, Everything but the kitchen sink! average: Oh, that's a small one, only seven drugs. I've been on 13before.Thirteen hivdrugs? average: Yeah. Like, literally everything but the kitchen sink. I've been a guinea pig for many different things. My doctorhas experimented with me with all sorts of therapies, in-cluding non-traditional things, just trying to keep me going. A TALE OF T-20 average: There are a lot of things that have changed in my life, like my needle-phobia. With all the blood tests I'vehad over the years, I usually had to look the other way. I'dgo completely white. Now I'm doing T- 20injections twice a day. The day I was to start the T- 20my good friend Anne came with me to the hospital for moral support and to be an extra set of earsand eyes so I'd remember everything. I had no idea whatwas involved. I was told there was going to be a simple de-vice that you just clicked. But when I got there, all these hy-podermic needles were laid out. I had to learn on the spothow to inject myself. The thing about these injections isthat they're subcutaneous\u2014and I have no body fat. So what do you do? average: They had to figure something out with me. I have a tiny bit of body fat on my abdomen. When you look atme you wouldn't think it, but when you squeeze it, it'sjust enough. Traditionally, with subcutaneous injections,you pinch the skin and put the needle down at a 90- degree angle, like straight down. But because I have zerobody fat, I pinch at my skin and go in sideways, almosttransdermally. In the same spot all the time? average: You have to rotate the injections. You can't go into the same spot twice because it leaves a node. Butnow, because the areas on my body are so used up, I wastold to just go where I can get the needle in. 12 THE POSITIVE SIDE Spring/Summer 2005The back is also a spot. So, Anne would come over at 5a.m. and 5p.m. and inject my back for me. She'd do that for two weeks and I'd do my abdomen for a week, andthat went on for about two months, until she said: \"Whydon't I come over every day and do your back? Save yourabdomen for when I'm sick or have to go away.\" She'sbeen a little trooper. My abdomen is scarred from the injections. It's so dense with the nodes that the T- 20doesn't absorb, so it takes a long time to inject and is extremely painful. Butwhen you're finished the injection, the pain is kind ofover, unless you put pressure on the spot or hug some-body . . . and seatbelts are a bitch. If you have an injection-site reaction, the place where you inject stays painful for acouple of days. It's living with pain but it's living. That survival instinct in me is quite strong. It's been a very challenging year, butit's way better than not having an immune system. Nowmy T cells are at about 350 and my viral load is back down to undetectable. THE B SIDE What side effects have you had from all the meds you've taken? average: I've had so many. One of the most frustrating was nosebleeds. If I leaned over to tie my shoes or picksomething up, my nose would start gushing\u2014sometimesfor a half-hour. It was a drag because I work out a lot and I couldn't go to the gym. I'm a biohazard\u2014I couldn'tbe hemorrhaging in public. After about eight months, my doctor figured out that it was the aztin one of my drugs, Trizivir. He told me to stop the aztbut to continue taking the other drugs in the combination [ 3tcand aba- cavir]. Thankfully he found that out because it stoppedthe bleeding. I was on Sustiva for just over a year. They told me that one of the side effects would be nightmares, which I got,but they didn't tell me that the nightmares aren't limited tothe night. Finally, I was at my doctor's one day and I said:\"I think I'm losing it. I'm frightened. I want to kill my cats.I want to kill myself. I want to run people over with my car.I don't know what to do. I think I'm getting dementia.\" SoI got pulled off that drug, but what a horrible year. I felt soout of control and like a danger to myself. For the past four years I've suffered from folliculitis, an inflammation of the hair follicles, from my waist up andall over my chest, back and face. I went to specialist afterspecialist, and no one's been able to figure it out. They'relike pimples, but they're right on the surface and veryitchy . . . I'm scratching 24 hours a day. There's been anawful lot of pain that I've had to live with. My Thinking Cap is a bald head with the brain sectioned out like diagrams of cuts of meat, and each section has differentwords like hope, love, courage, sex \u2014what's in the forefront of your brain to keep you going. The person has no nose; instead the pills 3 TC, d4T and AZT are strapped to the head like a nose. And what do you do for the pain? average: I could take painkillers all the time, but I don't want to. I want to be active. So I just deal with it. And then there's the lipodystrophy. I started losing my body fat about four years ago, which has been emotion-ally traumatic. You look in the mirror and you look like askeleton draped in skin. It's one of the reasons I startedworking out so intensely. Let me put it this way: I'm on myfourth butt. I lost it in the beginning. There was no fat lefton my ass. It hurt to just sit down. I started working outwith a trainer to get an ass back so I could sit on some-thing, and also to create muscles, as a sort of armour. I'vehad to stop going to the gym a few times because of thenosebleeds and sometimes my anemia was so bad that Ididn't have the energy, so this is ass number four. My self-esteem is pretty low. Before body-fat wasting people could tell you had hivif you had Kaposi's sarcoma on your face. But this is now the new face of aids\u2014the sunken cheeks and skinny legs. When I meet up withpeople, I can see the shock in their face. People don't rec-ognize me on the street. Your appearance has changed that dramatically. average: Oh yeah. It's not just the fat wasting\u2014it's the meds, the pain, the wear and tear. It's weathered me. Iwent from everyone saying that I was the youngest looking35year old they knew, to looking like Keith Richards on a bad day. I've got eczema and folliculitis. My face is crackedand scaly. Physically my body looks better than ever, butI've got Band-Aids all over my skin. My skin is ratherangry all the time. I have very few mirrors in my house. 13 Spring/Summer 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDE Are you angry? average: I live with anger all the time. Sometimes it's at myself, sometimes it's at the virus, sometimes just at theworld. I shouldn't say all the time, but I get very worndown from the constant challenges\u2014and lonely. You can'treally explain to people what you're going throughbecause they can't imagine. It's a lonely experience. Evenwhen I was in therapy, everything was so overwhelmingfor the therapist; he'd cry or shake his head, saying: \"Ican't believe this.\" A lot of times, I'd leave feeling worse. Have you taken drugs to deal with all the side effects? average: Oh, yes, tons of different things\u2014which is what kind of financially ruined me. I try not to look at what I'vespent at the drugstore. But one year my accountant toldme I spent like $10grand just at Shopper's Drug Mart\u2014all for drugs that might or did help with something. Now that I'm broke, I'm eligible for Fair PharmaCare in b.c., so fortunately I don't have to pay for prescriptions. With Fair PharmaCare, if you're in a certain incomebracket, the government will pay for drugs that are ap-proved. So, for example, now I don't have to pay for mytestosterone, which cost me like $400 every couple of months. And all the other things, like Septra and my anti-depressants, are finally covered. THE PILL BOX, PART II average: The moment they put me on the first cocktail, I said: \"I'm not doing this without both sides being cov-ered.\" So I hooked up with my naturopath at the sametime I started the drugs and I've been with her since. Itake many supplements from her. Like what? average: Let me go back to my pillbox. I take a multivita- min, cysteine), co-enzyme Q10, selenium, Panplex for digestion, a combination called sep efa , sat, dhea , and Can Plex. Once a week I get an intravenous shot of a Meyer's cock-tail\u2014a vitamin and mineral protocol with vitamin C, mag-nesium, calcium, B-complex, zinc and more. Is your naturopath experienced with hiv? average: She's learned a lot from me and she attends sem- inars. We're so intuitive with each other. She's really beenthere for me, like a therapist at times\u2014I've sat and criedwith her. She's a godsend. With all the drugs and supplements, I can't begin to imagine how many pills you take each day. average: Probably about 40pills twice a day. How do you keep track and remember it all? average: I've got three pillboxes and I have all the names written down and how many pills I take. Every morning Iget up and fill two small glass dishes with my morningand evening stuff. Then I take the morning dose, put theevening dose in the cupboard and do my injection. It'sbecome routine. Ray of Hope is my hand holding the pills I was taking\u20143 TC, d4T, AZT (and Septra)\u2014with rays coming out of it because it was the first cocktail.ANGELS IN CANADA How often do you see your doctor? average: I go to my gp once a week for a testosterone in- jection in my butt, and a B12/B-complex/folic acid injec- tion in my arm. This is my second gp. My first gprolled his eyes every time I mentioned the word \"naturopath\"and wouldn't even allow me to have a copy of my bloodwork to show her. So I searched out a gpwho was naturo- 14 THE POSITIVE SIDE Spring/Summer 2005 The One World, One Hope image was for the XIInternational AIDS Conference in Vancouver in 1996. The conference organizers asked if they could reprint the image I did in 1991 that becameCanada's first AIDS awareness poster. I said I wanted to rework it. The first image was just different faces, different people, and there was a heart in thecentre to suggest that we're all joined together as a race\u2014because we are\u2014and to get through this we have to do it with love and compassion. When Ireworked it, I decided to change it into stained glass to show the fragility ofhumankind, the face of AIDS , and that we are all connected. I kept the heart in the centre. The original image, from the AIDS aw ar e n e s s p o s t e r , g o t m e a l u n c h date with Princess Diana. I was invited to the national capital to be one of 50Canadians to dine with the royal couple at Rideau Hall. But the invitationdidn't include a plane ticket. When the owner of a local gay pub heard about ithe had an idea to auction off the little painting that was the image on theposter. The auction raised enough money so I could fly to Ottawa. A local paperprinted a story about the community helping raise money to fly me out, andReuters picked it up. The title of the article: 'Joe Average to lunch with PrincessDi.' Suddenly it was everywhere. So I flew to Ottawa, and Princess Diana's staff had clipped all these articles and showed them to her. After lunch the Governor General's wife,Gerda Hnatyshyn, said the Princess wanted to talk to me. There I was\u2014thislittle shy guy with a weird name and weird art\u2014with the full attention of thePrincess. It was one of the best moments of my life!path friendly, and that was great because it cut costs at my naturopath. Now my gpdoes the vitamin injections, and I leave the Meyer's injection to my naturopath. I see my hiv doctor only when I need to. How often is your blood work done? average: Usually once a month. With all the meds you're on, what about drug interactions? average: We've learned the hard way. But right now things are pretty good. How are your eating habits? average: I have to force myself to eat most of the time. With some of the drugs I've been on, the nausea was sobad. Pot is the only thing that helps. Both my doctors fullyrecommended it. I try to eat as well as I can, but when themoney is low it's difficult. A Loving Spoonful provides mewith seven frozen pre-made dinners a week, a loaf ofbread and some fruit and juice. It helps out a lot. You said you like to work out. average: I work out five times a week. I was working out on my own for a couple years here and there, but when Istarted losing the body fat I knew I needed some goodadvice and training. I'd saved some money as an \"in case Iget sick fund.\" But then I thought, \"Instead of having thismoney sitting there in case I get sick, why don't I hire atrainer and get strong?\" My trainer and I clicked immedi-ately. He was very anxious to train me and I've been withhim for over three years. About a year ago I was broke andcalled to tell him I had to stop. \"December's on me,\" he said.He wanted to give me a little chance to get back on my feet.\"Money's not an issue. Let's just make you stay healthy.\" Working out makes me feel alive. My trainer makes me laugh. He's a friend now, and they're hard to come by. Inmy 20s and 30s, all my friends died. I've met a few friends along the way, but I've become more introverted over theyears. The gym gives me an opportunity to interact withpeople, it gives me something to look forward to. Both mydoctors said hiring a trainer and working out is thesmartest thing I ever did. It helps mentally as well, so, somuch. I've risen from the ashes a few times. When I firsthooked up with my trainer, he knew I was hivpositive, and I said, \"I don't want you to treat me any different. Iwant you to constantly challenge me.\" And he does, so itmakes me feel like I'm winning. It sounds like you have some angels in your life. average: I don't have many friends, but I've got a few really great angels. I approached my naturopath last yearabout the financial situation, and she said: \"There are alot of bare walls in my house.\" So I did a barter with her\u2014I gave her enough prints to decorate her office. It's won-derful to get help, but I've tried to be as self-supportive aspossible. It's really hard for me to take something likethat, but I'm broke. It's just necessity.

Clinical trials offer information about a drug's effect on humans that investigators can't get from test-tube andanimal experiments. They are the gold standard of treat-ment research. /ring6The changing clinical landscape hiv/aids clinical research has changed dramatically over the past two decades. In the early days, when the antiretro-viral drugs that make up today's standard regimens werestill on the drawing board, phas participated in clinical trials simply to gain access to these lifesaving treatments. \"I en-rolled in my first trial in the early 1990 s, and at that time it was all about access to drugs,\" Sousa recalls. \"There weren'tmany treatment options approved for marketing, and clini-cal trials opened up possibilities for us. Researchers werestill comparing most potential drugs to a placebo becausethere were no standard treatments to test against.\" Today, with four classes of antiretrovirals approved for treatment in Canada and with opportunistic infections onthe decline in the developed world, clinical research isstarting to focus on other pressing issues. Hot new areasof research include treatment management (for instance,the study of structured treatment interruptions, or \"drugholidays\"), vaccines and microbicides for hivprevention, therapeutic vaccines (to boost the immune responseagainst hiv), treatments for co-infections, and new classes of antiretrovirals. These days, though, the rush to participate in a clinical trial has died down to a trickle. In a sense, hivresearch has become a victim of its own success: Potential trial partici-pants have found treatments that do a fairly good job ofkeeping their hivin check and, understandably, they don't want to rock the boat by enrolling in a trial. Some trials don't have much trouble recruiting partici- pants. For example, a Canada- uktherapeutic vaccine On the road to better HIV therapiesTreatments on Trial by Maia Joseph from Montreal. Sousa, who was diagnosed with hivin 1985 , knows what he's talking about: He's the chair of the Canadian hivTrials Network's Community Advisory Com- mittee and has participated in three clinical trials since theearly 1990 s. Sousa has seen hivresearch evolve over the years, but he knows the list of questions that still need answering is a longone. \"We need drugs that are less toxic,\" he says. \"We needto know whether it's okto take a drug holiday. We need to determine the best way to treat hiv/hep C co-infection. We need to find ways to prevent hivinfection. And we need a cure. We can't do any of this without clinical trials.\" Clinical trials, however, can't run without participants. And with trial enrolment on the decline, researchers arehaving more and more trouble finding answers to those all-important research questions\u2014answers that could prolongthe lives of people with hiv/aids (phas) and improve the quality of those lives. /ring6What isa clinical trial, exactly? Clinical trials are carefully designed experiments that allow investigators to test their research questions onpeople. Of course, the testing of a new drug or other treat-ment never begins with humans\u2014it starts in the lab, whereinvestigators perform in vitro (test-tube) experiments to determine the effects of the treatment on animal andhuman cells. Eventually, if the treatment shows promise,investigators test it on living animals to get a better idea ofhow it will affect humans. Ultimately, though, investigators will only know for sure whether a treatment is safe and effective by testing it onpeople\u2014and that's where clinical trials come into play. Atfirst, the treatment is tested on a very small number ofpeople. Then, if that test goes well, investigators conductlarger studies involving more participants.

But recruitment successis becoming less common as more and more trials strugglejust to get off the ground. /ring6The recruitment rut Trial recruitment is a thorny issue within clinical re- search circles\u2014one that's complicated by a range of factors.Perhaps most important is that clinical trials are a hard sellfor phas who would have to interrupt a relatively effective treatment regimen in order to participate. \"Your primary reason for taking part in a trial should be to help others in the future,\" Sousa says. Indeed, in the haart era, altruism plays a major role in the decision to enroll in a clinical trial, because even though review boardsmake every effort to minimize risk, the treatments are stillexperimental and there are no guarantees that aparticular trial will work for you. For a growing number of phas who want to help their community but don't want to sacri-fice their fundamental right to personal health,the decision to enroll involves a careful balancingact. They must weigh the risks and responsibilities thatparticipation in a trial might entail against the trial's poten-tial future benefit and their own desire to make a contribu-tion. No two people face exactly the same situation\u2014thesame health concerns, treatment options, lifestyle and sup-port network. \"It's always a completely individual deci-sion,\" Sousa emphasizes. But the personal decision faced by many phas is just one factor\u2014albeit a critical one\u2014in the participant shortage. 16 THE POSITIVE SIDE Spring/Summer 2005Some investigators are also finding it harder to makecontact with potential trial participants, primarily becausethe hivpopulation has diversified. It's more difficult to dis- seminate trial information to street youth and Aboriginalpeople living on reserves than to reach the close-knit, pre-dominantly urban community of gay men. Add to this thefact that the phapopulation is generally healthier than in the past\u2014meaning fewer clinic visits\u2014and it becomes clearthat investigators face a significant communication hurdle. Another key factor in recruitment is the increasing number of clinical trials. More studies mean more compe-tition for participants among the wide range of stake-holders who fund clinical trials. Trials driven by individualinvestigators\u2014which are usually funded by the govern-ment, universities and non-profit networks or organiza-tions\u2014compete head-on for participants with heavilyfunded trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.Such companies often have the means to run large, multi-site trials, while some investigators lobby for years just toget their trials funded at all. The result? Well, the best trials (whether investigator- or company-driven) do tend to go ahead. That said, the poten-tial for private pharmaceutical interests to undermine theinterests of the public is great. /ring6Clinical Catch-22 Researchers' ongoing efforts to run trials on structured treatment interruptions ( stis) offer a revealing example of the recruitment issue's complexities. These researcherswant to determine whether a planned drug holiday willlead to resistance or other problems. Such informationcould improve the quality of life of phas, given the high toxicity and complex dosing schedules of many antiretro-virals. Drug holidays could also decrease treatment costs. Most pharmaceutical companies won't touch the drug holiday issue. Results from a few publicly funded Canadiantrials that have struggled to address the question areeagerly awaited but have been slow in coming because clin-ical opinion remains divided. \"The beliefs held by doctors on this topic are quite variable,\" says Bill Cameron, md, the Canadian principal investigator of the tri-national Options in Management of Antiretrovirals ( optima ) study, which compares different approaches to treatment management, including planneddrug holidays. \"About half advocate stis and half do not, and within those groups there are other differences of opinion asto the type of treatment regimen a patient should be on,when and for how long an stishould take place, and so on.\" The fact that some physicians are skeptical about drug holidays means they're less likely to recruit for a studylike optima . Moreover, because of the division in clinicalConsidering enrolling in a clinical trial?

The result is a Catch- 22: Researchers can't get the answers they need about drug holidays because they can't enroll enough trialparticipants, and potential participants won't enroll be-cause researchers don't have clear answers. Dr. Cameron notes that answering treatment questions can take a long time, often owing to safety concerns. Hepoints to an influential breast cancer trial from the 1970 s and ' 80s, which compared the then-standard surgical pro- cedure for breast cancer, a modified radical mastectomy, toa lumpectomy\u2014a new, less invasive procedure. Despite thefact that the trial results could potentially improve quality oflife, enrolment was slow. \"Breast cancer is a lethal disease, and physicians thought they knew how to deal with it,\" Dr. Cameron says.\"Some felt they couldn't, in good conscience, recruit for thetrial because they worried that the new procedure wouldnot be as effective as the standard. It took eight years toenroll enough participants.\" In the end, the results of the trial showed an absolutely equivalent survival rate between the two study groups.Today, lumpectomy is the most common surgical procedurefor breast cancer. /ring6Dial \"T\" for trial What role can phas play in the complicated hivresearch environment, where varied opinions and interests seem theorder of the day? Staying informed and involved are para-mount. phas who are active in clinical research circles can identify the trials that best cater to their needs and push tohave those trials go ahead. Lynn Stevenson of Nova Scotia is one such pha. In search of treatment options, Stevenson enrolled in her firsttrial in the mid- 1990 s. Her experience was largely nega- tive: She suffered a drug side effect that led to health com-plications. \"You know there are no guarantees,\" she says,\"but you never actually think that something will happen toyou.\" Stevenson eventually left the trial and had the sideeffect treated, but she remained apprehensive about partic-ipating in another study. All the same, Stevenson stayed active in clinical re- search: As a registered nurse and aids activist, she served on hospital and community advisory committees, whereshe helped review trial protocols. She was able to see herside effect documented and to help set higher ethical stan-dards for clinical trials. This window into the institutional side of clinical re- search gave Stevenson added confidence in the process.Being informed about the benefits of clinical research alsokindled her desire to participate in a second trial when theright one came along. Stevenson's decision to try another trial was partly moti- vated by altruism, but personal concerns also played a role.She liked, for instance, the fact that participating in a trialmeant that her health would be monitored more often:\"Suddenly you feel like you're the centre of attention. Theclinicians and nurses are all there explaining the trial to you 17 Spring/Summer 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEand trying to make you feel comfortable. And throughoutthe trial you make more clinic visits, you get more care.\" \"With the trial I chose,\" she adds, \"I was confident that, given the extra monitoring, any problems would be caughtearly enough to be addressed. My decision involved verypractical considerations. I felt that, for me, the risk waspretty minimal.\" When asked if she can pinpoint a turning point on the road to participating in a second trial, Stevenson responds:\"It's an ongoing experience. On the first page of everyprotocol review, each member of the committee mustanswer questions about the study. The last one alwaysasks, 'If you were eligible, would you enroll in this trial?' IfI can't answer yes to that question, then I have to ask, 'Whynot?' And that brings me back to a safety issue or anotherfundamental issue that makes the trial seem inappropriate.Finally, I have to put my money where my mouth is.\" Stevenson, like Jos\u00e9 Sousa, stresses that the decision to participate in a trial belongs to each individual and that itrequires careful consideration. But it's also a decision thatpotential participants need to make\u2014not avoid\u2014becauseclinical trials are critical to advancing hivcare. \"It's really important that trials go ahead,\" Stevenson says. \"In theend, we need to know this information.\" Maia Joseph is a project coordinator and editor for the Canadian hivTrials Network's Communications and Information Programme. Participating in a clinical trial involves a time commitment, but the payoff for many participants is the extra attention they receive from theirdoctors. If you enroll in a trial, you can expect to take part in many or allof the following stages: 1Informed consent : You sign a form stating that you understand the trial and are willing to participate. 2Screening visit : You are asked questions about your health and treat- ments and then given a physical exam, along with lab tests. The investi-gator then decides whether you meet the entry criteria for the trial. 3Randomization : You are randomly assigned to a treatment group. 4Waiting period : You may have to wait for the trial to begin. The investigator will monitor your health during this period. 5Washout period : You may have to stop taking a certain medication and wait for a period of time. This allows the body to get rid of traces ofthe medication. 6Treatment period : The period during which you are on a study treatment before researchers evaluate its effect (usually 12, 24 or 48 weeks). 7Follow-up visits : Throughout the study you will be asked to come to the clinic for regular visits. The frequency of these visits is usually higherthan for routine care. 8End of study : The study usually ends when all participants have completed either the treatment or follow-up period.

As phas live longer, they may be dealing with health-related consequences of the diseaseand unwanted side effects of long-term hivtreatment, along with the general effects of aging. Exercise may help to address these issues and improve the overall healthand well-being of phas. While the benefits of exercise in the generalpopulation are well established, littleresearch has investigated the effect ofexercise on phas. The few small stud- ies that have been done show thataerobic exercise, resistance trainingor a combination of both is safe andmay be beneficial for phas who are medically stable. Aerobic exercise , otherwise known as cardiovascular (\"cardio\") or endurance training , works the cardiovascular system (heart andlungs) by raising the heart rate andstrengthening the heart. It involvesdoing a physical activity at low-to-moderate intensity for an extendedtime. Aerobic exercise helps improveyour endurance so you can do anactivity for longer without feeling tiredas quickly. Examples include: briskwalking, jogging, aerobics, swimming,cycling, dancing and cross-training. Resistance exercise , or weight training , strengthens muscles by contracting them against some sort offorce. It can increase muscle mass,making your muscles bigger and stronger. This could be especially use-ful for people experiencing symptomsof hiv-related machines.(You need a gym membership\u2014try soup cans or milk jugs as weights.)Isometric training \u2014when your mus- cles contract but your limbs don'tmove\u2014is another type of resistanceexercise. It's good for strengtheningmuscles that maintain your posture,such as the stomach and lower backmuscles. Examples include: yoga, TaiChi and Pilates. Stretching is an important part of any exercise program because it im-proves joint and muscle flexibility andmay help to prevent injury. Warm upbefore you stretch with a few minutesof light activity, like walking. Stretchesshould be held for at least 30seconds to maximize the effect. Don't forget tostretch after your activity as well. The FITT Principle Frequency. How often should you exercise? To maintain the benefits, ex-ercising 3-4times per week for an on- going period of time is recommended. Intensity. How strenuous should your activity be? Aerobic exercise isusually prescribed so that you'reworking at a percentage of your maxi-mum heart rate (usually around 70%). A useful guide is to exercise at a pacewhere you can carry on a conversa-tion without gasping for air. Resis-tance training is usually prescribed sothat you're lifting a certain proportionof the maximum weight you're able tolift. It's recommended to do 8-12 rep- etitions (or \"reps\") of lifting at a com-fortable weight for 2or 3sets. Make sure to rest for a minute or so be-tween sets. Time. How long should you exercise for? Generally, it's recommended thataerobic exercise be performed for atleast 20minutes, and resistance train- ing for 35-40 minutes (including rest periods between sets). Type.

As yourphysical fitness improves, you maywant to slowly increase the intensityor duration of your workouts. Exercise and . . . The immune system. The limited research available has shown thatexercise won't boost cd4counts or lower viral loads, but it does not seemto harm the immune system orworsen virological status for phas who are medically stable. Most stud-ies that have been done were for ashort duration, so we don't knowabout the long-term effects of exerciseon the immune system. Weight and body composition. Although the effects of exercise onlipodystrophy are unclear, a combina-tion of aerobic and resistance exercisemay help reduce fat buildup in thebelly. Resistance training (with orwithout aerobic exercise) can increaseweight and body composition, such aslean body mass and the size of armsand thighs, which is good news forpeople with hiv-related wasting. If you're thinking of starting an exerciseprogram, be sure to talk to your physi-cian or other informed health careprovider about safe parameters foraerobic exercise. Strength. Resistance training (with or without aerobic exercise) can im-prove overall upper and lower bodystrength for phas. Cardiovascular fitness.

Al-though we would expect that exercisemight help reduce the risk of heart dis-ease (as it does in healthy, hiv-nega- tive populations), it's still unclearwhether it can help reduce high cho-lesterol and triglyceride levels in phas. Bone problems. Bone problems are on the rise in phas. Although we're not sure why these problemsoccur, weight-bearing exercise is rec-ommended as a way to increase bonestrength and reduce the risk of frac-ture. If you have any type of bonedisease, talk with your doctor beforestarting an exercise program. Psychological health. Research shows that exercise can improve qual-ity of life, reduce stress, enhancemood and life satisfaction, and lowersymptoms of depression. Anabolic agents. Sometimes people take anabolic agents (such assteroids, testosterone or humangrowth hormone) in combination withexercise to increase body weight.Some anabolic agents may cause livertoxicity and elevate fat (lipid) levels, soif you're taking them, have your doc-tor monitor you closely. Some studieshave shown that anabolic steroids donot improve strength, weight andbody composition any more than exer-cise alone does. Just Do It! It's important to gear any exercise program toward your physical capabil-ity and personal goals. It's a good ideato talk with your physician, physio-therapist or other informed health careprovider to find out which programmight be right for you. If you want to join a gym, ask if they offer member-ship geared toward income or checkout your local Y for various activitiesand programs. Many non-profit gymsand community centres with gyms,pools and exercise classes offer freeaccess or reduced rates to phas, partic- ularly those on disability. This oftenmeans that phas can get free exercise counseling and supervision. You may want to track your activity in a log book, including dates youworked out, along with the frequency,intensity, time and type of exercise,and how you felt during and after.That way you can monitor your activ-ity level and progress over time. Work-ing out with a partner or group ofpeople who encourage you along theway may help you stay motivated.Exercise doesn't have to be a burden.There are many ways to build physicalactivity into everyday activities.

My year got off to a rocky start. I glanced up at thedoctor from my hospital stretcher. He had a fateful look as he focused be-tween me and the view from the scopethat was down my throat. A physicianmyself, I recognized that look of sur-prise and fear. He hastily asked for myconsent to tie off the bleeding andbulging varicose veins in my esopha-gus, which were threatening my life. Iagreed with a nod of my head, unableto talk due to the obstructing tube. It took a few more months and a biopsy to discover that the symptomsI'd been experiencing\u2014the discomfortfrom spleen; mildly ele-vated liver levels ( 2-3times above normal, which is not uncommonin people with hiv); fatigue; nausea, 20 THE POSITIVE SIDE Spring/Summer 2005vomiting, appetite and weight loss; andthe gradual changes in my mental abil-ities (feeling confused and having trou-ble doing more than one task at atime)\u2014were due to liver cirrhosis (per-manent scarring of the liver). Though Ididn't have jaundice (a condition inwhich the skin and whites of the eyesturn yellow) that's also seen in liverdisease, many of my symptoms sig-nalled that my liver may have been ail-ing. However, each of these symptomscould have been attributed to manyother different things, such as side ef-fects, other infections or cancer. When the liver fails, scar tissue piles up (fibrosis, then cirrhosis) interferingwith blood flow and function. Theswollen, bleeding veins in my esopha-gus were due to my rock-hard liverpreventing blood from flowing back to my heart. The backed-up pressuremade the veins around my esophagusswell, as they're used to getting theblood back to the heart. When thishappens, eventually the veins blow upand there's a high probability of bleed-ing to death. Was my time up? Liver Lessons This wasn't the first time I'd had news of a fatal disease. I've had hiv for more than two decades. Because Iwas operating in survival mode andassumed I was going die from aids, for all these years I focused on maintain-ing my viral load and cd4count, not worrying so much about other healthissues. If these counts are ok, I thought, I'll live on. However, when Iwas diagnosed with cirrhosis, my cd4 count was between 300and 400and I had an undetectable viral load. Somuch for that theory. These days, many people with hiv/aids (phas) confront multiple health problems due to a combination of their hiv, other illnesses they may have and side effects from hivtreatment. The effects of long-term treatment withhighly active antiretroviral therapy( haart ) are just becoming known as more of us are surviving longer andtaking the medications for prolongedperiods of time. It is increasingly recog-nized that many hivmeds have dra- matic effects on our bodily organs. Theliver is one of these organs. Tucked into the lower right-hand corner of the ribcage, the liver is like a processing plant. It takes the rawmaterials (like food) that are absorbedfrom our gut and breaks them down(or metabolizes them) to make manyof the basic nutrients for the cells ofour body. We cannot survive withoutthese liver-produced nutrients. Theliver also has the important role ofprocessing different substances weingest\u2014including medications, herbs,illicit drugs and alcohol\u2014and thendetoxifying and eliminating them. Beast of Burden Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver ( hepat = liver; itis= inflamma- ALL OFTHE SUBSTANCES PHOTO: PHOTOS.COMMeand My Liver A cautionary tale about chemical hepatitis by Gregory Robinsondue to a variety of reasons. There are two types of hepatitis that are commonamong phas: Gchemical hepatitis\u2014induced bysubstances such as medicines,herbs, alcohol, illicit hepatitis\u2014predominantlycaused by hepatitis A, B or C infec-tion (hep C is the most commonamong phas) Whether hepatitis is caused by chemical or infectious agents\u2014andhow severe and long the injury to theliver is\u2014will determine if the livercan survive. The good news is thatthis organ can often regenerate itselfeven after it is insulted. Many formsof viral hepatitis can be treated withmeds, but chemical hepatitis can onlybe \"treated\" by eliminating thecause(s) soon enough so that theinflammation subsides and cirrhosisdoesn't result. In people with chemi-cal hepatitis, a liver that is not yetseriously damaged can restore cells tonormal functioning in just a fewmonths, a respite that a break frommeds and/or other substances mayallow. When the injury is too severeor has happened over a long period oftime, eventually the inflammationcauses cirrhosis. Once liver scarringoccurs, it is permanent and not re-versible. However, the liver can anddoes still function for a while inpeople with cirrhosis depending onhow many liver cells are still working. I've been on hivmeds for 15years; for the past 10years I've been taking four or more antiretrovirals. Many ofthese drugs on their own can be hardon the liver, so I can only imagine theeffect of the mix of meds I've taken.Besides antiretrovirals (high doses ofthe as well as the nucleoside ana-logue ddI), some of the types of drugsI've been on include Lipidil (feno-fibrate), for high lipid, or fat, levels; anantidepressant; and anti-inflammatorydrugs, for arthritis\u2014all of which aremetabolized through the liver. It is essential to maintain a healthy liver\u2014it feeds our system and pro-cesses the multiple meds we take,including antiretrovirals and drugs for side effects and other diseases orinfections. All of the substances ourlivers are exposed to become a burdenon this vital organ. When your liver isburdened, you have to start thinkingholistically about your health andeverything that impacts your organs. Testing 1, 2, 3 So how do you know if your liver's taking a licking? To monitor the healthof this organ, your doctor should regu-larly take blood tests to measure yourliver enzymes. (It's a good idea to havethem checked a few weeks after youstart any new drug and then at leastevery 3-4 months.) These enzymes leak from the liver into the blood whenliver cells are damaged or killed. Liverenzyme tests do not measure how wellthe liver is working, they just indicatethat it's been injured by something. If your doctor suspects a problem, he or she may do more detailed teststo see if the liver is performing itsessential functions\u2014making proteins,making clotting factors to stop bleed-ing when you're injured, and process-ing and eliminating the waste productbilirubin. These tests include serumalbumin, bleeding time and bilirubin,respectfully. They are done when yourliver enzymes are either acutely ele-vated or if they remain elevated for aprolonged period of time. When thesetests are affected, it's a sign that theliver is failing to do its job. If liver damage is confirmed, other tests are done to investigate the causeand determine the severity. Theseinclude abdominal ultrasound or ct scans to examine the size and appear-ance of the liver; blood tests for thecause of hepatitis; alpha-fetoproteinblood test (for liver cancer); and some-times special tests for gallstones. Liver transplant doctors use a grad- ing system called the Child Pugh crite-ria to assess how well the liver is doingand if and when you should be listedfor transplantation. The Child Pughhas three categories (A, B and C) anduses the blood tests albumin, bleedingtime and bilirubin, along with changesin mental abilities and the presence offluid in the abdomen (ascites). If youhave advanced liver disease (cirrhosis)and your liver is still functioning fairlywell, you are an A. When the liver shows signs of failure to function youprogress to a B, a transplant is consid-ered and you may be listed for trans-plantation. If you become a C, it isunlikely that you will survive. Sometimes a liver biopsy is re- quired, in which a needle is insertedthrough the skin into the liver to take a sample. A liver biopsy is necessary to diagnose cirrhosis and is used toassess the degree of liver scarring andinflammation. A liver specialist shouldexplain the procedure to you, includingthe risks (such as internal bleeding),after-effects (pain), and the reason youneed it. These risks can be minimizedif the doctor has the right training andexperience with this procedure and ifyou're monitored in the hospital for afew hours after the biopsy. I sailedthough my biopsy without pain orcomplications. My biopsy confirmed that I had cirrhosis. All other tests led to an un-known cause for my liver disease (in medical lingo, this is referred to as All meds have the potential to cause liverside effects, including the following, which arecommonly used by PHAs: Gall antiretrovirals carry a risk of liver damage\u2014the risk is greater with ddI to help lowercholesterol and lipid levels Gacetaminophen (Tylenol; found in many over-the-counter pain relievers), primarily whenused in high doses with alcohol Gsome psychiatric meds Gsome cancer chemotherapy drugs Gmany anti-hypertensive agents to Gamiodarone Gantidiabetic agents Gestrogen steroids Gstreet and recreational drugs (such as heroin,cocaine, ecstasy) Gsome herbs and herbal teas (comfrey, Kava) If you use any of these, have your liver enzymelevels checked regularly.OUR LIVERS ARE EXPOSED TO BECOME A BURDEN ON THIS VITAL ORGAN.

When your liver is inflamed, how do you decide whether to switch, stop or stick with your meds?Though all six liver markers should be taken into account, here is a rough guide to one impor-tant liver enzyme, alanine aminotransferase ( ALT): ALTbelow 40 is minimal elevation above 40 is unlikely to be significant; anywhere between 200 and 600 is dangerous. It is rareand controversial to stay on meds if this enzyme count rises above 600. Check your liver function at least every 8 weeks for warning signs of damage.

After seven years of antiretroviraltherapy, I started to develop lipodystrophy.My legs got thinner, my belly got bigger, and my bum became almost \"undetectable.\" Withsunken eyes and shrunken cheeks, I felt like Ihad AIDS written all over my face. I looked weak, exhausted and sick. My family worried becausethey thought I was trying to hide a new terribledisease. I worried about my new metabolicproblems, like rising cholesterol levels, whichincrease the risk of heart attack. I switched one of my drugs\u2014d4T (Zerit), because it's well known that it's implicated in lipodystrophy\u2014to something more lipid-friendly. I also made some changes to my dietand did a lot more Taoist Tai Chi. Shortly after theswitch, my cholesterol returned to normal andmy body fat slowly began to reappear. In 2003,with the help of generous friends and family, Igot shots of New-Fill in my cheeks to restore myface. With more Tai Chi, my legs and bum alsocame back. During this time, I became more aware of the lipodsytrophy stigma experienced by a growingnumber of PHAs\u2014as well as the lack of relevant information and support. I was exasperated bythe slowness of the health network to recognizethe serious effects of lipodystrophy on thehealth, physical integrity and quality of life of PHAs. I wanted desperately to do something about this, so I joined LIPO-ACTION! \u2014a direct action group in Montreal that was created bylipo-laden PHAs and their sympathizers. I was on my way to becoming an HIVLipo Warrior! The medicine of LIPO-ACTION! is taking ac- tion. Since the beginning of our public actioncampaign, we have seriously disturbed thosewho claim that lipodystrophy isn't so bad. By breaking the silence together, we inform,sensitize and mobilize the public about the impact of lipo on PHAs. With 70 active members in Quebec, we've organized many creative andtheatrical demonstrations at HIVevents, where our lipo characters wear masks and balloons asbellies and humps, hold up placards withsmacking slogans and shake our big noisy pillboxes. Our troop of \" HIV mutants\" and arche- typal characters represents different facets ofthe reality of lipodystrophy, including the HIV Lipo Warrior (fighting for a better quality of life),The Scream of Munch (loneliness and despair),and the three insensitive and denying doctors\u2014Dr. Blindpills, Dr. Bouch\u00e9 (deaf) and Dr. Motus(mute). The use of symbols enables us to fire theimagination and touch people. After a skit youcan see the rising of dignity again in the eyesof participants. In just a few months\u2014with demos, work- shops, lobbying politicians and the media, andparticipating in press conferences and meetingsof AIDS organizations\u2014 LIPO-ACTION! has man- aged to break the silence about the reality oflipodystrophy. Now we can hope for a betterresponse to a problem that is recognized.I strongly recommend the medicine of LIPO-ACTION! By coming to our monthlymeetings or creating agroup in your area, youcan better face lipodys-trophy and strive togetherfor concrete solutions. Youcan reach us by e-mail atlipoactionquebec@yahoo.ca.
