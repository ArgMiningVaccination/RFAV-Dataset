Medical Director Tanveer Chaudhry, M.D., and expert in integrative and holistic medicine, leads a distinguished team of medical professionals and support personnel at our facility, which is considered a leader among luxury detox centers in Florida. Spring Gardens Recovery in Tampa, offers guests a cutting-edge, non-12-step rehab program. Drawing on Dr. Chaudhry's background in psychiatry and neurology, as well as his extensive experience in alcohol and drug addiction treatment, we have created a personalized and holistic approach to drug and alcohol addiction detox that puts the guest at the center of a world of opportunities. Holistic and integrative medicine is ideally suited to use in drug and alcohol detox centers for a wide variety of reasons. As the Academy of Integrative Health & Medicine points out, \"Holistic physicians embrace a variety of safe, effective options in the diagnosis and treatment, including: a.) education for lifestyle changes and self-care b.) complementary alternatives; and c.) conventional drugs and surgery \"Illness,\" the AIHM adds, \"is viewed as a manifestation of a dysfunction of the whole person, not as an isolated event.\" Dr. Chaudry is board-certified in integrative medicine, which is defined by the American Board of Integrative Medicine\u00ae (ABOIM) and the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine as \"the practice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals, and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing.\" Meeting the requirements for board certification in this dynamic field reflects a mastery of the knowledge required to practice integrative medicine and a commitment to the Medical Code of Ethics promoted by the American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS). \"In addition to scientifically sound treatment concepts, the practitioner of [integrative medicine](http://www.abpsus.org/integrative-medicine-meaning) espouses the broad concepts of health promotion/illness prevention and healthy living. Practitioners also are expected to exemplify these tenets and to remain open to self-exploration and self-development,\" the ABOIM says. The ABOIM credits physician and author Andrew Weil, MD, for his significant contributions in the establishment of the field of integrative medicine as a specialty. \"His ideas about the treatment and care of the whole person integrate scientifically-validated therapies of conventional medicine with select practices derived from areas sometimes considered to be complementary and alternative medicine.\" According to the ABOIM, Dr. Weil's defining principles of integrative medicine include: - A partnership between the patient and the practitioner - Consideration of all factors that influence health, wellness, disease - including mind, body and spirit - Use of conventional and alternative methods to facilitate the body's innate healing response - Appropriate consideration given to use of less-invasive and less-harmful interventions, when possible, while addressing the whole person in addition to the disease. - The concept that medicine is based on good science, is inquiry-driven and open to critical consideration of new paradigms At Spring Gardens Recovery, we are proud to be one of the most innovative of all Florida drug detox centers. If you think an integrative and holistic approach would be helpful on your journey to recovery, we would be pleased to welcome you to our luxury detox center in Florida. "}
