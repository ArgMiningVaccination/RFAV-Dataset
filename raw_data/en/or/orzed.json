Including brain tissue samples from \"asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (ASYMAD)\" individuals who represent an intermediate group in the gradation of neuropathology from controls to AD patients in the absence of cognitive impairment during life allowed us to relate measures of brain glucose concentration and glycolytic flux to incremental levels of AD pathology and symptom expression. Equally importantly, by measuring glucose concentrations in brain regions both vulnerable to distinct pathological features of AD, that is, MFG (amyloid deposition) and ITG (tau accumulation) as well as in a region relatively resistant to AD pathology, that is, cerebellum [34], we were able to determine whether the observed alterations in brain glucose concentrations and abnormalities in glycolysis were related to defining pathological processes. | || | [ Food Groups and Risk of All-cause Mortality:](../nutrition/ABSTRACTS/Food_Groups_and_Risk.shtml) A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Prospective J Clin Nutr. 2017 (Jun); 105 (6): 1462-1473 The associations between 12 food groups defined a priori and risk for all-cause mortality were systematically assessed in this meta-analysis through comparison of extreme categories and dose-response analyses both for linear and nonlinear relations. Nine of the 12 food groups showed an association with all-cause mortality in the categorical or continuous dose-response analyses; an inverse association was present for whole grain, vegetable, fruit, nut, legume, and fish consumption, whereas a positive association was present for red meat, processed meat, egg, and SSB consumption. | || | ~ FULL TEXT [ The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in the](../Graphics_Box_NUTRITION/ABSTRACTS/The_Role_of_Reactive_Oxygen_Species.shtml) Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease: Longev 2016 (Dec 27); 2016: 8590578 Neurodegenerative diseases affect not only the life quality of aging populations, but also their life spans. All forms of neurodegenerative diseases have a massive impact on the elderly. The major threat of these brain diseases includes progressive loss of memory, Alzheimer's disease (AD), impairments in the movement, Parkinson's disease (PD), and the inability to walk, talk, and think, Huntington's disease (HD). Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are highlighted as a central feature of brain degenerative diseases. Oxidative stress, a condition that occurs due to imbalance in oxidant and antioxidant status, has been known to play a vital role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, PD, and HD. A large number of studies have utilized oxidative stress biomarkers to investigate the severity of these neurodegenerative diseases and medications are available, but these only treat the symptoms. In traditional medicine, a large number of medicinal plants have been used to treat the symptoms of these neurodegenerative diseases. Extensive studies scientifically validated the beneficial effect of natural products against neurodegenerative diseases using suitable animal models. This short review focuses the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and HD and the protective efficacy of natural products against these diseases. | || | [ Genetic Risk, Adherence to a Healthy Lifestyle,](../nutrition/ABSTRACTS/Genetic_Risk_Adherence.shtml) and Coronary Disease N Engl J Med 2016 (Dec 15); 375 (24): 2349-2358 In conclusion, after quantifying both genetic and lifestyle risk among 55,685 participants in three prospective cohorts and one cross-sectional study, we found that adherence to a healthy lifestyle was associated with a substantially reduced risk of coronary artery disease within each category of genetic risk. | || | [ Combining Pain Therapy with Lifestyle: The Role](../Conditions/Combining_Pain_Therapy.shtml) of Personalized Nutrition and Nutritional Supplements According to the SIMPAR Feed Your Destiny Approach J Pain Res. 2016 (Dec 8); 9: 1179-1189 ~ FULL TEXT Recently, attention to the lifestyle of patients has been rapidly increasing in the field of pain therapy, particularly with regard to the role of nutrition in pain development and its management. In this review, we summarize the latest findings on the role of nutrition and nutraceuticals, microbiome, obesity, soy, omega-3 fatty acids, and curcumin supplementation as key elements in modulating the efficacy of analgesic treatments, including opioids. These main topics were addressed during the first edition of the Study In Multidisciplinary Pain Research workshop: \"FYD (Feed Your Destiny): Fighting Pain\", held on April 7, 2016, in Rome, Italy, which was sponsored by a grant from the Italian Ministry of Instruction on \"Nutraceuticals and Innovative Pharmacology\". The take-home message of this workshop was the recognition that patients with chronic pain should undergo nutritional assessment and counseling, which should be initiated at the onset of treatment. Some foods and supplements used in personalized treatment will likely improve clinical outcomes of analgesic therapy and result in considerable improvement of patient compliance and quality of life. From our current perspective, the potential benefit of including nutrition in personalizing pain medicine is formidable and highly promising. | || | [ Vitamins and Nutrients as Primary Treatments in](../Graphics_Box_NUTRITION/ABSTRACTS/Vitamins_and_Nutrients_as_Primary.shtml) Experimental Brain Injury: Clinical Implications for Nutraceutical Therapies Brain Res. 2016 (Jun 1); 1640 (Pt A): 114-129 With the numerous failures of pharmaceuticals to treat traumatic brain injury in humans, more researchers have become interested in combination therapies. This is largely due to the multimodal nature of damage from injury, which causes excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, edema, neuroinflammation and cell death. Polydrug treatments have the potential to target multiple aspects of the secondary injury cascade, while many previous therapies focused on one particular aspect. Of specific note are vitamins, minerals and nutrients that can be utilized to supplement other therapies. Many of these have low toxicity, are already FDA approved and have minimal interactions with other drugs, making them attractive targets for therapeutics.

In the US alone, more than 3 million people sustain a TBI annually. It is one of the most disabling injuries as it may cause motor and sensory deficits and lead to severe cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial impairment, crippling vital areas of higher functioning. Fueled by the recognition of TBI as the \"signature injury\" in our wounded soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, and its often devastating impact on athletes playing contact sports, interest in TBI and TBI research has increased dramatically. Unfortunately, despite increased awareness of its detrimental consequences, there has been little progress in developing effective TBI interventions. Recent evidence, however, strongly indicates that nutritional intervention may provide a unique opportunity to enhance the neuronal repair process after TBI.

It is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and other parts of the brain, leading to motor impairment, cognitive impairment, and dementia. Current treatment methods, such as L-dopa therapy, are focused only on relieving symptoms and delaying progression of the disease. To date, there is no known cure for PD, making prevention of PD as important as ever. More than a decade of research has revealed a number of major risk factors, including oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, numerous nutraceuticals have been found to target and attenuate these risk factors, thereby preventing or delaying the progression of PD.

[1] The outcome is a nation of people who rely on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for relief. Unfortunately, this is associated with various side effects that can be life-threatening for some. The second leading cause of peptic ulcers is the use of NSAIDs. Concerning ulcer-induced mortality, one third of NSAID / aspirin deaths are associated with low-dose aspirin use, presumably to prevent cardiovascular disease.

A group of researchers grew fruit, vegetables, and reared cattle on adjacent organic and non-organic farms across Europe, including a 725-acre farm attached to Newcastle University in England. They discovered that the organic fruit and vegetables they produced contained 40% more antioxidants than conventional produce. Lab assays of the milk from their organic cattle revealed that the organic milk contained 50% to 80% more antioxidants than their conventional milk. They also found that other organic staples they grew, including wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage, onions, and lettuce also contained 20% to 40% more nutrients than their conventional counterparts.

Regulators assert that rigorous safety assessments have confirmed that these levels are not a threat to food safety. Consumers intuitively know this is a false assurance. No rigorous scientific safety assessment has or can be made of the infinite number of mixtures of compounds consumers are exposed to.

For some years, however, the term has been synonymous with weight loss. It conjured up images of calorie counting, carbohydrate charts, and fat grams, all topped with a helping of discipline, and maybe a lapse or two on the side. Nutrition or health often were meager portions if they were served at all. The goal was to trim the waistline.
