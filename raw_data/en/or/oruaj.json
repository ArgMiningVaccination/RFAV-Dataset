Each year, many Americans search the internet for \"nutritional supplements near me,\" and 86% of them reach for supplements. Our chiropractors here at West Suburban Wellness compiled the following guide to help our patients grasp the essential role that supplements have in chiropractic care. Nutritional Supplements and Chiropractic Care Chiropractic nutritional supplements help enhance the work we do here at West Suburban Wellness and the many interventions we prescribe for home use. Since adjustments, massage, and custom exercise plans all increase circulation to treated areas, they help ensure tissues get adequate supplies of oxygen and other nutrients. Improving nutrient flow doesn't do much good if the nutrients aren't high quality or of sufficient quantity to affect the tissues being treated. The American diet is one of our least favorite aspects of living in this country. Fast food and convenience foods are depleted of nutrients. High-quality nutritional supplements from chiropractors help ensure that our patients get adequate vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. One of the most exciting aspects here at West Suburban Wellness is the objective tests we can perform to gauge results. An example of this is blood tests we can conduct to determine the levels of various vitamins and other supplements in the blood. These tests allow us to correct for deficiencies and to monitor the levels of supplements as we see other positive changes in patients, such as wound healing or improved immune function. Common Nutritional Supplements From Our Chiropractors Since individual health needs vary greatly, our supplement prescriptions can be extremely varied. In our experience, however, there are certain supplements that we most commonly prescribe due to their effect on overall health. These include: - Multivitamin, vitamin C and vitamin D - Calcium - Omega-3 fatty acids - Probiotics The Holistic Approach Nutritional supplements help us to take a holistic approach that empowers the whole person. Strategic supplementation helps our patients see the role that daily self-care plays in improving their own health. It also gives us the opportunity to take advantage of the full powers of potent phytochemicals and other nutrients. Benefits of Nutritional Supplements The nutritional supplements that we prescribe here at West Suburban Wellness have many benefits. The following section contains some of the rewards our patients can reap from taking our most popular prescribed supplements Multivitamins Multivitamins are a kind of insurance policy against the typical American diet. While our patients do their best to follow our nutritional recommendations, gaps in nutrition still sometimes occur. As a result, a complete multivitamin can ensure that our patients get an adequate supply of essential vitamins and minerals. Vitamin C Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can help reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease, and arthritis. In addition to its role in immune health, vitamin C also helps the body absorb iron, so taking vitamin C can help boost energy in those with anemia or low blood iron levels. Some other ways the body uses vitamin C include forming and healing body tissues, creating collagen, healing wounds, and maintaining the teeth. Vitamin D While the body makes some vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight, taking a supplement is an excellent way to ensure adequate consumption of this essential vitamin. Vitamin D is critical for absorbing calcium and building strong bones and teeth. It also increases immune defense against some diseases. Omega-3 fatty acids Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish and flax seed, but a supplement can help ensure consistent daily intake of this vital nutrient. Omega-3 fatty acids have many anti-inflammatory benefits, such as reducing blood pressure and triglycerides. This supplement can also lower the chance of developing an abnormal heart rhythm or having a heart attack, stroke, or sudden death from a cardiac event for those who are living with heart disease. Probiotics Although eating yogurt and drinking kefir are two ways to get probiotics in the diet, supplements can help ensure consistent probiotic consumption. Probiotics are good bacteria that reduce inflammation and enhance immune functions. Some benefits of this supplement include reduced illness from harmful bacteria, more complete digestion of foods and improved absorption of medications. How Nutritional Supplements Help Autoimmune and Inflammatory Disease Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases cause a lot of illness and dysfunction. Many of the supplements we prescribe, including probiotics and omega-3 fatty acids, reduce inflammation. Other prescribed supplements enhance autoimmune health by bolstering the immune system. These include vitamin C and vitamin D. Is Strategic Supplementation Right for You?
