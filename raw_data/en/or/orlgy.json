I'm appearing on behalf of America's Health Insurance Plans or, as it is commonly known, AHIP. As we stated in the interim committee process, AHIP sees this bill as a first step to provide much needed transparency in this market. AHIP supports this bill with the amendments we are suggesting below. We are supportive of efforts to shed light on the \"black box\" that drug manufacturers are permitted to operate in with respect to their pricing. There continues to be a need for more transparency regarding drug pricing and HB 1032 includes several positive elements - including: Limiting the disclosure of proprietary or trade secret data and limits the publication of data that is non-public, or that is unrelated to the price of the prescription drug; Placing pharmaceutical manufacturers on similar footing as other sectors of the health care industry regarding financial disclosures; and Providing notification of excessive significant drug price increases by pharmaceutical manufacturers. However, there are elements of the bill that could be improved. We ask that the bill mandate submission of health insurer information to the Insurance Department (Department) rather than the Board of Pharmacy. Carriers are accustomed to submitting data to the Department, and it has mechanisms in place to receive carrier information. It is also critical that competitive and proprietary information be protected. The Board of Pharmacy is comprised of engaged and active market participants whose access to sensitive market data could result in a conflict of interest. Thank you for your time and consideration. I'd be ha ppy to answer any questions. #116 2 PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO HB 1032 Page 5, line 8, delete \"board\" and insert in lieu t hereof \"commissioner\" Page 5, delete lines 20 - 25 Page 5, line 30, delete \"the board reports\" and ins ert in lieu thereof \"submitted\" Renumber accordingly House Human Services Committee HB 1032 Prescription Drug Cost Transparency January 6, 2021 Josh Askvig , AARP North Dakota jaskvig@aarp.org - (701) 355 -3642 Chairman Weisz and members of the House Human Services Committee , My name is Josh Askvig, State Director for AARP North Dakota. I appreciate your time today and look forward to working with you on an issue that is crucial to our members and one we are already seeing that they are passionate about. Before I get into the reason we are working so hard to fight the high cost of prescription drug prices I'd like to spend just a moment reminding you who we are and why we are here. AARP is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization with nearly 38 mi llion members. 86,000 of those members live in North Dakota - a staggering number when you consider the overall population of our state. Our story dates back 60 years, to when our founder, Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus found a former colleague of hers living in a chicken coop. I know we talk about that often, but we think it says a lot about why we fight for what we do. A lot of issues touch older Americans and their ability to live safe, independent and healthy lives. Most of our work fits into three areas; hel ping people choose where they live, remain financially secure and access affordable health care. The rising cost of prescription drugs hits our members , and frankly all North Dakotans , in all three areas. It's a high priority for us right now, not only a t the #21 -North Dakota state level, but at the federal level as well. Let me outline just a couple of the reasons why. In AARP's 2020 survey of North Dakota adults, in the past two years, one - quarter reported not filling a prescription that was provided by their doctor - 44 percent of those adults - decided not to fill a prescription that their doctor had given them because of the cost of the drug. And as you can see in one of my handouts in the circle in the middle between 2012 and 2017, the average annual cost of prescription drug treatment increased 57.8 percent, while the annual income for North Dakotans only increased 6.7 percent. Increasing drug prices hit older North Dakotans particularly hard. Most Medicare beneficiaries live on relatively modest incomes . A Kaiser Foundation study from 2016 shows the median income for Medicare recipients is just over $26,000 - and a quarter of the people hover closer to $15,000. They also have very little savings. Half the Medicare population has less than $75,000 saved u p. Their ability to absorb increasingly expensive prescription drugs is nearly impossible. Many people we have talked with recently t ell us they have to make difficult decisions about how to live because of the price of those drugs. On a second handout you can get a good feel for why they have to make that crushing choice. Near the top of the page are three common illnesses in North Dakota - cancer, diabetes and heart disease - with the number of residents of our state who have be en diagnosed. More than 60,000 with cancer and nearly as many with diabetes. Below those numbers are common drugs used to treat them and their costs from 2017 . Please, take note that we've included what those same drugs cost just five years earlier. One ne arly doubled, another jumped $100,000! On our Facebook page you can see some videos of North Dakotans facing these costs. There is one from Pat who told us a drug she took 10 years ago was $60. Now she pays $600! And Roger, who has found a way to import the leukemia drug he needs from Canada, s aw the price of his medicine jump from ----10 bucks to 24 -hundred bucks in a month! Why? Because he moved from his great PERS plan to Medicare. Now, we know states can't solve this problem alone. But there are some things that can be done and we appreciate t his committee's willingness to bring t his issue to the forefront. We believe transparency from manufacturers, PBMs and insurance companies can help the state and consumers get a handle on these increasing prices and be prepared for when things are going to change. We appreciate that the bill draft in its current form addresses transparency at all three levels. Furthermore, the thorough description of what should be disclosed is encouraging. We do, however, have a couple of suggestions. On page one of the bill, w e would suggest deleting the lines 18 -20 (the definition of \"Manufacturer -packaged drug container\") and replacing with \"'Wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) Unit ' means the lowest identifiable quantity of the drug or biological that is dispensed, exclusive of any diluent without reference to volume measures pertaining to liquids. If reporting by drug group as indicated by the State Board of Pharmacy , it is the total numb er of WAC units in the drug group. \" Next , under section 2, subsection A, at the top of page 3 is unclear because it does not set a timeframe for the cost of the drug. Meaning, it states \"a cost of $70 or more \" but does not say whether that $70 is incurred for one pill, one month's supply or one year's sup ply. We believe the language should be clarified to specify the timeframe. In addition, under Section 2, subsection a on page 3 we'd suggest adding per WAC unit to line 6 as follows \"...acquisition cost of seventy dollars or more per WAC Unit for a manufacturer -packaged drug ...\" Also, and more importantly, we believe an independent board or committee should receive the report and that the report should be presented in a way consumers can understand it. Maybe the State Board of Pharmacy has time to receive this report, sort through it and make it understandable. But we think the Board likely already has enough to deal with. A transparency bill should be abou t getting information to the general public in a way that interested North Dakotans can not only access it, but understand it. An independent board should review prices and allow for consumer review and input. Again, we fully appreciate the positive mome ntum nationwide and in North Dakota to truly affect change in this alarming pocketbook issue. Medicare Part D enrollees take an average of four -and-a-half prescriptions per month and more than two-thirds have two or more concurrent chronic illnesses. These patients will likely be taking their medicine every year for the rest of their lives. That makes this issue relevant not only to the thousands of individual North Dakotans fighting disease, but it also affects those paying for health coverage and to the state. Spending increases driven by escalating drug prices are passed along to everyone with health insurance coverage in the form of h igher premiums and deductibles. It increases costs for taxpayer -funded programs too - making this a relevant issue for ev ery North Dakotan whether they are taking prescription medicine or not. Thank you again for your thoughtful work on this issue. We wholeheartedly appreciate any effort to make medicine more affordable. This bill is a step in the right direction and we loo k forward to working with you during the interim to make it the best possible bill for North Dakotans. Thank you . 1 | P a g eHouse Human Services HB 1032 Jan. 6, 2021 Chairman Weisz, Members of the House Human Services Committee : My name is Daniel Weiss, Senior Executive Director, Pharmacy Benefits, Sanford Health Plan (SHP). I appreciate the opportunity to share with the committee a few comments on HB 1032 dealing with Prescription Drug Price Transparency. For your information, Sa nford Health Plan provided comments during the deliberations of the Interim Health Committee and we stand in support of this legislation, as amended. As you know, many states have passed legislation aimed at improving transparency in drug pricing and ac cordingly, to address the issue of skyrocketing drug prices. Sanford Health recognizes the importance of providing North Dakota consumers with affordable, access to quality health care services and treatments. Prescription drugs play an important role in t he management of health, particularly for those with chronic illnesses. HB 1032 will facilitate the disclosure of some of the data needed to address and understand why prescription drug prices are rising, and hopefully provide incentives for the distribut ion chain to act in a fiscally responsible way. We are committed to working with North Dakota on the critical issue of drug price transparency and this legislation. We applaud Rep. Keiser for his ongoing efforts to help consumers and address health care costs. In that spirit, we offer the following sugg estions. We believe Rep. Keiser consi ders these friendly amendments : #91 2 | P a g e 1) Consider adding provisions requiring wholesalers to disclose their business practices in a similar manner as the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM). This will provide information and aware ness of unknown discounts and rebates offered and retained by the pharmacies 2) Consider including in this legislation another important entity in the North Dakota prescription drug chain \u2014Pharmacy Service Administration Organizations (PSAO). A PSAO is a cont racting entity hired by pharmacies to manage their PBM contracts. While I cannot speak to all existing relationships between PSAOs and pharmacies, in our current network, we have approximately 76% of all pharmacies contracted through these organizations. T hat represents 159 of the 209 network pharmacies. Where these organizations can provide critical support in contracting and negotiation, there can also be conflicts of interest due to ownership influence. Thank you for your time and consideration. I am ha ppy to answer any questions and provide clarification.

I appear today to provide testimony on House Bill 1032. The Department is opposed to H ouse Bill 1032 as it is currently written simply due to the concern that the definitions of \"health insurer\" and \"pharmacy benefits manager\" could be interpreted to include North Dakota Medicaid and the programs we process through our systems (e.g. traditional, expansion, children's health insurance program , AIDS drug assistance pr ogram, special health services, and county jails ). As the House Human Services Committee knows, the Department provides detailed reporting to the legislature during sessions and during the interim to multiple committees. The Department feels it would be burdensome to provide the reporting specified in House Bill 1032. The Department will continue to provide detailed reporting as required by federal requirements and to the legislature as it has done so in the past . The Department would ask that clarification is added to the definitions to make it such that the Department, and the current programs administered by the Department (some of which are for Department of Health programs) are not included in the requirements of House Bill 1032. This concludes my testimony , and I am happy to answer any questions you may have. #1001 Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development (CSDD), \"Briefing: Cost of Developing a New Drug,\" Nov 2014. 2 QuintilesIMS Institute, \"Medicines Use and Spending in the U.S.\" May 2017. In Opposition to House Bill 1032 - Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Legislation January 6 , 2021 Position: The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) opposes House Bill 1032, which would require significant reporting mandates , will not help patients , could threaten access to needed prescription medications , and potentially chill the innovation of future treatments. Discussions about cost and affordability of medicines are important. N o patient should have to worry about whether they can afford the health care they need. However, the notion that spending on medicines is the primary driver of health care cost growth is false and ignores cost savings that medicines provide to the health care system overall. Medicines lead to fewer physician visits, hospitalizations , surgeries , and other preventable procedures . All of which translate to lower health care co sts. New medicines are making crucial contributions to medical advances and changing the direction of health care as we know it. With more tha n 4,500 medicines in the pipeline (74% which have the potential to be first in class medicines and 42% of which could be personalized medicines ), patients have greater hope than ever before. However, this transparency bill is likely to skew important discussions of policy issues in ways that are systematically biased against innovation and ignores the value of medicines to patients , the overall health care system , and the economy of North Dakota. Proposals to mandate additional disclosure of proprietary i nformation by biopharmaceutical companies would neither benefit patients nor decrease health care c osts. The biopharmaceutical industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the United States. Companies currently report extensive information on costs, sales, clinical trials, and total research and development (R&D) expenditures in 10 -K filings . Proposals to mandate public disclosure of additional confidential and proprietary infor mation by biopharmaceutical companies ignore the large amount of information already publicly reported on an annual basis by companies and are based on the faulty assumption that prescription drug spending is the major driver of increases in health care costs. The reporting requirement s for manufacturers do not reflect the total investment of industry because of the long -term nature of research and development. Manufacturers pursue research efforts that include many failures and iterations on the path to development of a single approved drug. In fact, according to Tuft's Center for Study of Drug Development (CSDD), only 12 % of medicines in the pipeline make it through the approval process by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1 An 88% failure rate underscores how expensive and risky drug development is. Drug costs are the only costs in the health care system that decrease over time due to market changes , such as brand to brand competition and patent expirations . It is important to note that medicines are the only part of the health care system where costs decrease over time. When brand name medicines face brand competition, or when they lose their patent protection and generic drugs become available, prices drop, often significantly. In fact, it is projected that from 2019 -2023, there will be approximately $105 billion in savings due to competition from generic and biosimilar products as patents for brand #75 STATEMENT RESEARCH PROGRESS HOPE 3 IQVIA Institute Drug Channels Institute 4 Berkeley Research Group (BRG).

However, o ne component of health spend ing that is not decreasing , is health insurance . Instead , it is seeing significant increases. Between 2007 - 2017, d eductibles for patients have tripled and co -insurance has doubled . The Kaiser Family Foundation has routinely show n patient costs are increasing faster than insurers ' costs. Morevover, h ealth insurance and health plan administration costs are rising at more than twice the rate of drug spending. According to new research from the Berkeley Research Group (BRG), rebat es, discounts, and fees paid by manufacturers , are on the increase , while the share received by manufacturers has decreased over time.4 In fact, nearly half (46 %) of total spending on brand medicines went to the supply chain and other entities in 2018. This is a 13%- point increase from 2013 , when other stakeholders retained 33 % of brand medicine spending . This data reaffirms that we need to look at the entire sup ply chain in order to solve patient affordability challenges . Misaligned incentives must be fixed in the supply chain, including the broken rebate system, to ensure patients benefit at the pharmacy counter from the significant discounts and rebates. In addition, brand and generic biopharmaceutical companies, unlike other sectors of health care, generated $41 million in rebates to the State of North Dakota and federal government in 2018 . This is 55% of the t otal Medicaid spend ing on prescri ption drugs in the state.5 If the intent of House Bill 1032 is to improve access and affordability to needed medicines, the language of the bill is misguided. The legislation does nothing to address how much consumers ultimately pay for a medicine , an amount determined by insurers , not biopharmaceutical companies. This legislation should do something to help patients afford their prescription medicines, such as passing on the rebates directly to the patients at the point of sale at the pharmacy counter . Instead, these rebates are going t o the plans and other supply chain stakeholders. Recent data shows that insurers are increasingly requiring patients to pay exorbitant out -of-pocket (OOP) costs to access the medicines they need, far more than other health care services covered by an enrol lee's health plan. A recent IQVIA study that looked at OOP patient spend ing for brand name medicines from 2015 - 2019 and showed that patient 's spend on deductibles and co-insurance accounted for more than 2/3 of total OOP spend for brand medicines in five out of seven therapy areas examined . For two therapy areas (oncolo gy and multiple sclerosis), it accounted for more than 90%.6 This occurrence is contrary to the purpose of insurance \u2014to spread the costs of health care uti lization , so that patients can access needed care, including medicines. Today, a patient pays only about 3% for OOP hospital costs , but 13% or more for their medicines.7 Additionally, insurers are increasing utilization management techniques to aggressive ly restrict a patient's use of medicine. Currently, three major pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate steep discounts on prescription dr ugs for more than 70 % of all prescriptions filled in the U .S. Express Scripts alone covers about 90 million American s.8 The biopharmaceutical industry supports over 800 jobs in North Dakota , with a generous annual average compensation 10 Su W, Lockwood C; IHS Markit.

That translates into $10 million in both state and federal taxes annually, as well as a total annual economic output of $207 million for the state . The industry is committed to working with lawmakers, patients, doctors, and other health care stakeholders to pursue policies that promote manufacturing, R&D , and innovation , while ensuring co nsumers have access to needed medicines. Prescription medicines have transformed the trajectory of many debilitating diseases and conditions, including COVID - 19, HIV/AI DS, cancer, and heart disease, resulting in decreased death rates, improved health outcomes, and better quality of life for patients. Better use of medicines could eliminate up to $213 billion in U .S. health care costs annually, which represents 8% of the nation's health care spending.10 Therefore, instead of focusing on reporting of information that does nothing to help the patient, perhaps the conversation should focus on better use of medicines, which yields significant health gains by avoiding the need for other, more costly, medical s ervices. House Bill 1032 is not the way to accomplish improved access and affordability, therefore, PhRMA respectfully urges North Dakota lawmakers to oppose this bill . The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) represents the country's leading innovative biopharmaceutical research companies, which are devoted to discovering and developing medicines that enable patients to live longer, healthier and more productive lives. Since 2000, PhRMA member companies have in vested more than $900 billion in the search for new treatments and cures, including an estimated $79.6 billion in 2018 alone. House Human Services Committee HB 1032 January 6, 2021 - 1:30 pm PCMA Testimony in Opposition to HB 1032 CHAIRMAN WEISZ AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS: My name is Michelle Mack and I represent the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association commonly referred to as PCMA. PCMA is the national trade association for pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which administer prescription drug plans for more than 266 million Americans with health coverage provided by large and small employers, health insurers, labor unions, and federal and state- sponsored health programs. To give you a bit of information on PCMA and what PBMs are and what they do, I am including a document describing this in addition to my testimony. As we stated in the interim committee process, PCMA supports meaningful transparency across the supply chain, including transparency that empowers patients, prescribers, clients, and policymakers to make informed decisions that lead to optimal health outcomes and lower costs. HB 1033, does not achieve these goals and therefore we oppose and urge you to give HB 1033 a Do Not Pass recommendation. We also feel the need to ensure the protection of competitive and proprietary financial information. Therefore, we are very concerned about the data being collected by the Board of Pharmacy. The FTC issued a letter on this issue when the Mississippi legislature passed a law granting the Board of Pharmacy with the authority to regulate PBMs. \"[b ]ecause pharmacists and PBMs have a competitive, and at times, adversarial relationship, we are concerned that giving the pharmacy board regulatory power over PBMs may create tensions and conflicts of interest for the pharmacy board.\" 1 Similarly, t he FTC has opposed regulat ory boards composed of market participants in other industries. In North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission, the United States Supreme Court looked into the question as to whether the state board could decide that a certain procedure could only be performed under the supervision of a dentist, thereby driving lower priced non -dentists out of the market. The FTC questioned the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners' ability to regulate an industry in which they were active participants noting, '\"common sense and economic theory.... dictate the conclusion that Board actions in this area could be self interested\"2 We believe that the Department of Insurance would be the appropriate agency for such competitive data. The Board of Pharmacy is comprised of active market participants whose access to market sensitive data could result in a conflict of interest and undermine competition in the prescription drug marketplace. The industry worked with various stakeholders in Texas throughout the process there to amend similar language on disclosure. A key amendment included in the final passage of Texas HB 2536 aggregates the rebate information reported by PBMs and health plans before publishing the data. 1 FTC letter to Representative Mark Formby, Mississippi House of Representatives, (March 22, 2011). 2 Emory University School of Law, \"Legal Studies Research Paper Series\". Joanna Shepherd 2013 #124APCMA Pharmaceutical Care Management Association 325 7th Street, NW, 9th Floor Washington, DC 20004 www.pcmanet .org House Human Services Committee PCMA Testimony in Opposition to HB 1032 January 6, 2021 - 1:30 pm Page 2 This important clarification protects proprietary, private business and competitively sensitive information. PCMA respectfully requests the insertion of similar language such as the following : \"The Insurance Commissioner shall collect and aggregate all the collected data and publish the aggregated data from all reports for that year required by this section in an appropriate location on the department's Internet website. The combined aggregated data from the reports must be published in a manner that does not disclose or tend to disclose proprietary or confidential information of any pharmacy benefit manager or health plan [Carrier/Insurer]\" in the section entitled \"Disclosure of pharmacy benefit manager information \" and the section entitled \" Disclosure of health insurer spending information\" . PCMA also suggests the following language be included so the data submitted to the Department of Insurance is not subject to open records requests, except for the aggregated and de- identified data that is in the published report. Rulemaking - Forms - Services - Records. 4. A report received by the board commissioner is an exempt a confidential record as defined by section 44- 04-17.1. North Dakota open records laws have three classes of public records. Given the sensitive nature of the information within this bill's scope, it is more properly deemed \"confidential information\" rather than \"exempt record.\" In addition, PCMA respectfully request s the section involving penalties be either updated or removed from the bill. If anything, administrative penalties imposed by the regulator would be more appropriate to levy than c ivil penalties , especially when reporting to the Department of Insurance . I would like to make note, that drug manufacturers are responsible for setting the list price of drugs. No evidence exists to suggest that rebates cause higher drug prices. A study of list prices and rebates for the top 200 most prescribed drugs between 2011 and 2016 indicated that there is no correlation between rebates and list price increases or launch prices for individual drugs. 3 Of these drugs, there were prices that increased significantly, some that increased slightly, and some rebates that were high, and some that were low. Top brand drugs that offered little to no commercial sector rebate during this time period still increased their prices, and manufacturers are increasing drug prices regardless of rebate levels negotiated by PBMs. Among the top 200 brand drugs by 2016 sales, the launch prices for drugs introduced from 2012 to 2016 were double the launch prices for those introduced prior to 2012. There was no correlation found between the prices and rebates. 3 Increasing Prices Set by Drugmakers Not Correlated with Rebates, Analysis prepared by Visante on behalf of Pharmaceutical Care Management Association 325 7th Street, NW, 9th Floor Washington, DC 20004 www.pcmanet.org House Human Services Committee PCMA Testimony in Opposition to HB 1032 January 6, 2021 - 1:30 pm Page 3 Again, pharmaceutical manufacturer s set drug prices. Therefore, the language on page 3 beginning on line 20 relating to the factors that led to drug price increase will likely yield better information if the language is amended to read as follows: \"A definitive statement regarding the factor or factors that caused the increase in the wholesale acquisition cost and an explanation of the role of each factor's impact on the cost.\" PCMA requests that the due date for annual data collection be changed to July 1 st to ensure comprehensive reporting of information for the preceding calendar year. This request will allow for a complete and accurate accounting of information that by its nature lags at least one quarter behind. Stated differently, w hile information can be reported on April 1st of each year, it will not represent complete information for the preceding calendar year. PBMs negotiate on behalf of their clients and consumers to help drive down the cost of prescription drugs by using market- based tools that encourage competition among drugmakers and drugstores. PBMs support and practice transparency that empowers patients, their providers, plan sponsors, and policymakers, so that there is informed decision- making that can lead to lower prescription drug costs. We appreciate your interest and commitment to keeping the costs of drugs affordable for the citizens of North Dakota and look forward to working with you in your efforts to pass meaningful legislation.

Prescription Drug Transparency Description Prescription drug pricing transparency efforts require drug manufacturers to report the reasons behind high prices and price increases. The principle behind the bills is that increased disclosure around pricing practices will result in more meaningful and actionable information for states and accountability for manufacturers . Drug pricing transparency legislation will also help payers determin e whether a drug price or price increase is justified. Moreover, the added scrutiny brought on by transparency legislation could encourage drug manufacturers to reconsider their standard practice of setting high launch prices and then increasing them year after year. AARP strongly supports increased transparency in the drug development and pricing process and generally throughout the prescription drug supply chain. However, because too much transparency within the drug supply chain can actually reduce competition and lead to higher drug prices , transparency legislation should strike a careful balance between the desire for more information and the p ossibility that such disclosures could harm competition and lead to higher drug prices . How does this work? Transparency bills require pharmaceutical companies to provide specific information about their pricing practices. Transparency legislation generally requires pharmaceutical companies to provide information about how a drug is priced, and to justify large price increases (or launch prices) that exceed a predetermined threshold. A transparency model bill drafted by NASHP (National Academy of State Health Policy) includes the following manufacturer reporting requirement triggers : For brand -name drugs: A 20 percent increase per WAC (wh olesale acquisition cost) unit during any 12 -month period; For generics: A WAC unit price of $10 0 or more, and a 20 percent increase per WAC unit during any 12 -month period; For new drugs: A WAC of $670 or more; and#20 STOPD GREED CUT DRUG PRICES Now-1/8/2020 2 Used for Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs ) and wholesalers: The state will require PBMs and wholesalers to report on specific drugs identified as being of interest following state review of manufacturer and insurer reports . Some states have also included penalties in their bill language for manufacturers that fail to report. The NASHP model language includes a penalty of $30,000/day. The model language also invokes subpoena authority if reporting entities do not provide the required data or if the data they provide is unclear or inadequate. What does a transparency law mean for consumers? Transparency bills, while by themselves do not reduce prescription drug prices , should be considered important building blocks for other legislative efforts , such as cost review commissions and drug affordability boards that can more directly address costs. In addition, t ransparency laws may provide consumers with advance warning of increases in their drug costs, allowing consumers to discuss lower cost altern atives with their health providers . Moreover, in order to avoid reporting requirements set forth by transparency laws, manufacturers may limit their price increases to keep them below the reporting threshold. Where has this state legislative policy been enacted ? In 2016, Vermont passed the nation's first transparency law , which has led to many state legislatures considering bills requiring more disclosure and transparency from drug manufacturers. In total, according to NASHP data , 12 states (CA, CT, CO, ME, MN, NH, NV, MD, OR, TX, VT, WA) have enacted drug transparency laws. In 2019 , approximately 27 states filed 53 bills on transparency with 6 states (CO, ME, NV, OR, TX, WA) successfully passing the following laws in 2019. Colo rado - HB 1131 requires a drug manufacturer or its agent to provide a prescriber the wholesale acquisition cost of a drug when marketing or providing information on a drug to a prescriber. Maine - LD 1162 requires manufacturers to report annually to the Maine Health Data Organization (MHDO) about drug prices when the manufacturer has, during the prior calendar year, increased the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of a brand - name drug or a generic drug by a certain per pricing unit percentage. Nevada - SB 262 expands existing law, which requires transparency around drugs used to treat diabetes, and requires new transparency for drugs used in the treatment of asthma. The law also authorizes the state to collect monetary penalties for noncompliance. Oregon - HB 2658 amends transparency leg islation passed in 2018 and requires manufacturers of prescription drugs to report to the state any specified increase in price of certain prescription drugs at least 60 days before the date of such increase. 1/8/2020 3 Texas - HB 2536 requires drug manufacture rs to disclose pricing information to the state on drugs with a wholesale acquisition cost of $100 or more for a 30 -day supply, or that increase 40 percent or more over the preceding three calendar y ears or 15 percent or more in the preceding calendar year. Pharmacy Benefit Managers and insurers are also required to make annual reports to the state. All information disclosed will be posted publicly. Washington - HB 1224 requires drug manufacturers to disclose the 25 most - prescribed drugs, the 25 costliest drugs by total plan spending, the 25 drugs with the highest year -over -year increase in spending, and a summary analysis of the impact on drug costs on health premiums. Manufacturers must submit annually a description of the factors used to make the decision to increase the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of the drug and the amount of the increase, along with a justification for the increase. This law also requires a phar macy benefit manager (PBM) to submit an annual transparency report. A number of states that have passed transparency laws are using this legislation as a springboard to establish prescription drug rate review or rate setting commissions. State rate revie w commissions analyze drug pricing data from manufacturers , recommend policy options to the state for decreas ing prices and, in some cases , establish drug price ceilings. TESTIMONY OF REBECCA FRICKE HOUSE BILL 1032 - Prescription drug transparency Good afternoon, my name is Rebecca Fricke . I am the Chief Benefits Officer of the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System, or NDPERS. I appear before you today in a neutral position on House Bill 1032 . I am available should there be any questions related to the impact of the bill on any of the NDPERS benefits. #23January 6, 2021 Chair Weisz and Members of the House Human Services Committee, My name is Ellen Schafer. I live in Bismarck and I am an advocacy volunteer and member of AARP North Dakota's Executive Council. I am testifying this afternoon in support of House Bill 1032. The rising cost of prescription drugs impacts all North Dakotans , but hits older North Dakotans particularly hard. Most Medicare beneficiaries live on relatively modest incomes. Their ability to absorb increasingly expensive prescription drugs is nearly impossible. Many of my friends, neighbors and family talk about the difficult decisions about how to live because of the price of those drugs. My sister was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The medication used to treat her leukemia is called Sprycel. Currently the drug costs $15,000 per month. She is retired and cannot afford this medication. The doctor placed her on a catastrophic list and which has helped her obtain a grant to pay for this medication. The cost of her medicatio n will now be covered until December of 2021. After that she is not sure what will happen. If she is required to pay for the medication herself, she will have to quit this life saving medication. Another drug the doctor has ordered for her is a respiratory inhaler called Trilogy to help her breathing. This medication currently costs $450.00 a month. She had to quit taking it because she cannot afford to pay for it. My sister is not alone, AARP research shows that between 2012 and 2017, the average annual cost of prescription drug treatment increased 57.8%, while the annual income of North Dakotans only increased 6.7%. In AARP's 2020 survey of North Dakota adults, 44% of respondents decided not to fill a prescription that their doctor h ad given them because of the drug's cost. We cannot afford higher drug prices and bills like this one will shed some light on why ND's prescription prices are sky high so we can find solutions to bring down the price. Thank you again for listening to mine and other AARP members concerns as you work on this issue. I wholeheartedly appreciate any effort to make medicine more affordable. House Bill 1032 is a step in the right direction and I hope you give the bill a favorable recommendation. Thank you. #69\"Cigna\" is registered service mark and the \"Tree of Life\" logo is a service mark of Cigna Intellectual Property, Inc., licensed for use by Cigna Corporation and its operating subsidiaries.

January 5, 2021 The Honorable Robin Weisz, Chair Human Services Committee North Dakota State Legislature State Capitol 600 East Boulevard Bismarck, ND 58505 Dear Chairman Weisz and Committee Members: Cigna is a national health insurance provider that has been on the front lines of providing patient access and coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Express Scripts is a pharmaceutical benefit manager (PBM) that cares for over 80 million lives in the United States. Together, Cigna and Express Scripts have created a new health services leader. The combined companies are increasing affordability, choice and predictability for our customers while enhancing quality care and producing better health outcomes. We appreciate the ability to submit comments on HB1032 as the committee is considering it . We believe that it is really imperative that the Insurance Commission er, as the regulator, collect and aggregate the data requested by PBMs instead of the Board of Pharmacy. The Department of Insurance is the licensing and regulatory agency for PBMs per North Dakota Chapter 26.1-27.1. As such, the Department is well-situated to handle such competitive data. The highly sensitive and proprietary information is best collected by the enforcement agency and removes the conflict of interest presented by the Board of Pharm acy. We suggest striking \"board\" on page 4, line 13, and replacing it with \"commissioner \". With that change, section 3 on the top of page 5 should also reflect a change to the Commissioner. The language could read as follows: (3)Within thirty days of receipt of a report under this section, the reported information shall be formatted for publication on the commissioner 's website. The information provided may not disclose or tend to disclose proprietary or confidential information of any pharmacy benefit manager. We have similar concerns with the section pertaining to health insurers. As the Commissioner is the regulator for this industry, we would suggest striking \"board\" on page 5, line 8, and inserting \"commissioner \". With that change, section 1 (b) on page 5 should also reflect the change to Commissioner. The language could read as follows: (b) Within thirty days of receipt of a report under this section, the reported information shall be formatted for publication on the commissioner 's website. The combined aggregated data from the reports must be provided in a manner that does not disclose or tend to disclose proprietary or confidential information of any health insurer. Thank you very much for your consideration of our concerns. We look forward to working together.

Rohr North Dakota House Human Services Committee North Dakota State Capitol Bismarck, ND Dear Chairman Weisz, Vice -chair Rohr and members of the House Human Services Committee , The Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) opposes HB 1032 . BIO is the world's largest trade association representing over 1,000 biotechnology companies, academic institutions , state biotechnology centers, and related organizations across the United States and in more than 30 other nations. BIO members are involved in the research and development of innovative healthcare, agricultural, industrial, and environmental biotechnology products. BIO is opposed to HB 1032 , as we believe that any prescription drug pricing transparency provisions should focus on what matters most for patients : their out -of-pocket costs. That includes ensuring patients know what their cost-sharing obligations are, how health plans and pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBM s) are using manufacturer rebates, and what prescription drugs are available on any formulary. This type of information can assist to determine which health plan most appropriately meets that patient's medical needs. Further, th is legislation could harm the fragile ecosystem that provide s for small, innovative companies to exist. Many of these companies have no existing pipeline in which to fund research and development, but instead rely on venture capital and angel investors . Biopharmaceutical discovery and development is already the riskiest of endeavors, and this legislation could have the unintended consequence of driving these vital funding sources to other industries due to the required release of propriety or confidential information. Finally, the legislation does not take into consideration the savings to the health care system provided by the effective use of b iopharmaceuticals. BIO believe s that transparency in he althcare spe nding is vital ly important . But we also believe transparency provisions should focus on what matters most for patients , their out -of-pocket costs .

My name is Dennis Pathroff , and I am an attorney with the Zuger Kirmis & Smith law firm in Bismarck. I am here today representing Prime Therapeutics, a pharmacy benefit manager (\"PBM\") . Prime's sole insurer that it represents in ND is BCBSND. We oppose HB 1 032 in its current form. As drafted , HB 1032 requires PBMs to disclose competitive financial data to the state board of pharmacy . See page 4, lines 12 -13 of the bill. While we don't necessarily oppose the disclosure, we oppose disclosure to the board of pharmacy. PBMs ' disclosure of competitive financial data to the board of pharmacy creates a n inherent conflict of interest. This is because the board of pharmacy is made up of pharmacists - direct competitors of PBMs. Pharmacists and PBMs negotiate prices that plan spo nsors pay for prescription drugs at retail pharmacies; the lower the price that PB Ms negotiate, the lower the profits for pharmacies. HB 1032 gives the pharmacist -controlled board of pharmacy the opportunity to weaken PBMs' competitive bargaining position s, and in turn, benefit pharmacies . As was suggested by the US Supreme Court in North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. F.T.C., 574 U.S. 494 (2015), there is a real danger that regulatory boards composed of market participants may pursue their o wn interests rather than those of the state. To avoid th e conflict of interest in providing competitive financial data to a market adversary , HB 1032 could be amended to require that the data be disclos ed to the Insurance Commissioner - a neutral third party. Attached to my testimony is a memorandum more fully explaining the problems associated with disclosing PBMs' financial data to the board of pharmacy. Please review this memorandum at your convenie nce. As currently drafted, I urge a do not pass recommendation on HB 1032 . Chairman Weisz and members of the committee, t hank you for the opportunity to comment on HB 1032. I'd also like to mention that Prime's Principal Government Affairs Lobbyist, Alex Sommer, is in the Zoom que and would like to testify on this bill. I'd stand for questions. #120 MEMORANDUM TO: House Human Services Committee FROM: Dennis HB 1032 (21.0006.05000) - Disclosure of Pharmacy Benefits Manager Information to the State Board of Pharmacy INTRODUCTION As drafted, the Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager (\"PBM\") to disclose competitive f inancial data to the state board of pharmacy. The bill also provides the state board of pharmacy with discretion to disseminate the data. This memo analyzes the problems associated with the disclosure and recommends the data be classified as a \"confidential record\" and be disclosed only to the Insurance Commissioner. DISCUSSION A. The Disclosure Requirement The bill provides in pertinent part as follows: 1. On or before April first of each year, a pharmacy benefits manager providing services for a health care plan shall file a report with the board . The report must contain the following information for the previous calendar year: a. The aggregated rebates, fees, price protection payments, and any other payments collected from each drug manufacturer; b. The aggregated dollar amount of rebates, price protection payments, fees, and any other payments collected from each drug manufacturer which were passed to health insurers; c. The aggregated fees, price concessions, penalties, effective rates, and any other financial incentive collected from pharmacies which were passed to enrollees at the point of sale; and d. The aggregated dollar amount of rebates, price protection payments, fees, and any other payments collected from drug manufacturers which were retained as revenue by the pharmacy benefits manager. 2. Reports submitted by pharmacy benefits managers under this section may not disclose the identity of a specific health benefit plan or enrollee, the prices charged for specific drugs or classes of drugs, or the amount of any rebates or fees provided for specific drugs or classes of drugs. 3. Within thirty days of receipt of a report under this section, the board shall provide the reported information to the commissioner in a format ready for publication on the commissioner's website. The information the board provides to the commissioner may not disclose or tend to disclose proprietary or confidential information of any pharmacy benefit manager.1 B. Problem of Disclosing Information to a Competitor A PBM's disclosure of its competitive financial information to the state board of pharmacy may lead to a Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") complaint or lawsuits resulting from an anticompetitive restriction on trade . This is because t he state board of pharmacy is made up of pharmacists, the direct competitors of PBMs. Pharmacists and PBMs are competitors in two different areas of the prescription drug market.2 First, pharmacists and PBMs negotia te prices that plan sponsors will pay for pre scription drugs at retail pharmacies; the lower the price that PBMs negotiate, the lower the profits for pharmacies.3 Second, retail pharmacies directly compete with PBM -owned mail -order pharmacies for prescription drug sales; the more prescription drugs sold by mail -order pharmacies , the fewer drugs sold by retail pharmacies.4 As currently drafted, the Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill gives the pharmacist -controlled board of pharmacy the opportunity to exploit the disclosure of the PBMs' competitive data in ways that benefit pharmacies at the expense of PBMs. Wielding the competitive financial information disclosed by PBMs, the board could establish various rules or practices that improve pharmacists' bargaining position as they negotiate with PBMs for retail prescription drug prices.5 Similarly, the board could establish rules that restrict cost -saving practices that attract consumers to mail- order pharmacies and away from retail pharmacies.6 In a letter addressing the likely consequences of allowing a state board of pharmacy to regulate PBMs and gather competitive financial data from PBMs , the FTC opined: Because pharmacists and PBMs have a competitive, and at times, adversarial relationship, we are concerned that giving the pharmacy board regulatory power over PBMs may create tensions and conflicts of interest for the pharmacy board. Indeed, the antitrust laws recognize that there is a real danger that regulatory boa rds composed of market participants may pursue their own interests rather than those of the state . . . . [A]llowing the Pharmacy Board to demand confidential business 1 HB 1032, Pages 4 -5 (emphasis added). 2 Joanna Shepherd, The Fox Guarding the Henhouse: The Regulation of Pharmacy Benefit Managers by a Market Adversary , 9 NW J.L. & SOC. POL'Y.1 (2013), p. 9. 3 Id. 4 Id. 5 Id. at 10. 6 Id. information from P BMs and to disclose it presents a significant threat to competition tha t could lead to higher prescription drug prices.7 Similarly, the FTC has opposed regulatory boards composed of market participants in other industries. In 2010, the FTC filed an administrative complaint charging the North Carolina Dental Board with violations of federal antitrust law. The FTC alleged that the board's concerted action to exclude non- dentists from the market for teeth whitening services in North Carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of competition. At the time, the dental board consisted of six licensed dentists, one licensed hygienist, and one consumer member. In its analysis of the regulatory framework of the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners, the FTC stated that when a state regulatory body is controlled by participants in the very industry i t purports to regulate, \"common sense and economic theory . . . dictate the conclusion that Board actions in this area could be self interested.\" 8 In response to the FTC's administrative complaint, the North Carolina Dental Board argued for the state-action exemption from antitrust law and moved to dismiss the complaint . The state -action exemption provides immunity for (1) public actors performing state - mandated activities or (2 ) private actors working under the oversight of the state. Ultimately, in North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. F.TC., 574 U .S. 494 (2015), the United States Supreme Cour t held that the North Carolina Dental Board was a sovereign entity controlled by active market participants that did not receive active supervision by the state, and therefore, the board's anticompetitive actions were not entitled to immunity from antitrus t law. As was suggested by the FTC and Supreme Court in North Carolina Dental, it is safe to assume that the members of a professional board that are competitors to a group they are charged with regulating may act in their own self -interest. Requiring the disclosure of a PBM's competitive and proprietary financial data to the state board of pharmacy creates an inherent conflict of interest by giving pharmacists an advantage over their natural competitors in the marketplace. Ultimately, this may lead a potential lawsuit or FTC complaint. To avoid the inherent conflict of interest in providing financial data to a competitor , the Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill could simply require a PBM to disclose the data to the Insurance Commissioner - a neutral third party. Note that the Insurance Commissioner is already reviewing PBM's competitive, proprietary financial data for other reasons. 9 Also note that in states that have adopted similar legislation, the r eports go to the insurance regulatory authority.10 7 Letter from Susan S. DeSanti et al., Director Fed, Trade Comm'n, et.

Stat. \u00a7 62W.06), 1369.502), 92-505), and Iowa (Iowa Code \u00a7510C.2) . C. Protection from Open Records Requests Reports containing a PBM's competitive financial data should not be subject to open records requests. As currently drafted, the Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill gives the state board of pharmacy the discretion to disclose a PBM 's competitive finan cial data. In pertinent part the bill provides: 4. A report received by the board is an exempt record as defined by 44 -04-17.1.11 In North Dakota \"all records of a public entity are public records, open and accessible for inspection . . . [e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided by law.\" 12 Because the open records law does not apply \"if otherwise specifically provided by law,\" public records need not be disclosed if they fall within a specific exemption from the open records law. 13 There are 3 classes of public records under ND law : (1) Confidential - disclosure of these documents is generally prohibited; (2) Exempt - disclosure is discretionary; and (3) Subject to open records law - disclosure of these documents is required.14 As drafted, t he reports containing PBMs' competitive financial data are \"exempt records.\" Therefore, it is in the pharmacy board's discretion to disclose a PBM's competitive financial data via an open records request. As explained in Section B, supra, the members of the board of pharmacy are competitors of PBMs, and therefore, may act in a manner that disadvantages PBMs. Indeed, imagine a scenario where a pharmacist or drug manufacturer makes an open records request for the competitive financial data . It's not hard to imagine the board coming up with some viable reason to provide the information. If, in fact, the board does disclose PBMs' data on rebates, fees, and price protection payments via an open records request, it will reduce PBMs' bargaining power to negotiate discounts with pharmacies and rebates with drug manufacturers because both pharmacies and drug manufacturers are less likely to offer the same price terms to PBMs when they know rival pharmacies and manufacturers can learn the specifics of the arrangement. Ultimately, the open records request disclosure of the competitive data would likely lead to reduced discounts and rebates that PBMs can pass on to consumers and health plan sponsors. Therefore, the reports containing PBMs' competitive financial data should not be classified as \"exempt records\" but rather \"confidential records\" - not subject to open records requests. CONCLUSION Granting the state board of pharmacy control to collect PBMs' competitive financial data creates an inherent conflict of interest by giving a group of pharmacist s regulatory control of their natural 11 HB 1032, Page 6 , line 10 (emphasis added). 12 N.D.C.C. \u00a7 44-04-18. 13 See ND AG Open Records Manual, August 2019, Page 23. 14 Id. at 24 -25 (citing \u00a7 N.D.C.C. 44- 04-17.1(3) and \u00a7 44 -04017(5)). competitor s in the marketplace. Under the current reporting scheme in the Prescription Drug Transparency Bill , the boa rd of pharmacy will have the opportunity to weaken PB Ms' competitive positions, and in turn, benefit pharmacies.

Hardy, PharmD Executive Director House Bill No 1032 -Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Human Services Committee -Pioneer Room 1:30 PM -Wednesday- January 6th 2021 Chairman Weisz, Members of the House Human Services Committee for the record I am Mark Hardy, PharmD, Executive Director of the North Dakota State Board of Pharmacy and I thank you for providing me the opportunity to offer testimony on HB 1032 relative to prescription drug cost transparency . The Board of Pharmacy has been engaged with the Interim Health Care Committee on this bill draft which is now before your committee. The Board of Pharmacy certainly understands and respects the desires of many to bring transparency to prescription drug costs. We are monitoring many of the initiatives taken by other states, similar to this bill draft, to address the public and patient's concerns with the continued escalation of drug pricing. We, the Board and profession of Pharmacy, found particularly troubling, the testimony we heard during the Interim Committee on the huge amount of prescription drug costs that were attributed to rebates shared between manufacturers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers [PBMs]. The Trump Administration and Center of Medicare through the Medicaid Services has taken notice of these rebates in their recent executive orders. The Board of Pharmacy stands ready to act on any legislation that the Legislature implements on this topic. We understand there are several more initiatives yet to be introduced surrounding drug costs. We do feel that drug pricing is and will continue to be an issue that states will struggle with trying to enact meaningful legislation as, ultimately the true reform would have to be addressed on a Federal level to achieve any meaningful change in these convoluted dynamics of the entities involved. The reality we see and hear from our pharmacists, pharmacies and, most importantly, their patients is that there continues to be escalating drug prices while the business challenges of reimbursement to a pharmacy continue to plummet, which naturally asks the question \"where/\u00a7_ the money going\"? We have been encouraged by much of the Federal action that has been attempted on drug pricing. However, it remains to be seen how much meaningful change actually occurs moving forward. While everyone points the finger as the various parties involved the true reality of this situation is that the patient care can be compromised when affordability is an issue. While the Board of Pharmacy does not have a formal position on this legislation, we stand ready to work with you on any legislation we can be of assistance on. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have and hope to be a resource to you in any way you deem appropriate. 2021 HOUSE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Human Services Committee Pioneer Room, State Capitol HB 1032 2/16/2021 Relating to prescription drug cost transparency Chairman Weisz opened the committee meeting at 11:06 a.m. Representatives Attendance Representative Robin Weisz P Representative Karen M.

I appear today to provide testimony on Engrossed House Bill 1032. The Department would be neutral to Engr ossed House Bill 1032 if it is amended to exclude the Department and all programs the Department processes through our system (e.g. traditional Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, children's health insurance program, AIDS drug assistance program, special health services, county jails). The Departmen t provides detailed reporting to the legislature during sessions and during the interim to multiple committees. The Department feels it would be burdensome to provide the reporting specified in Engrossed House Bill 1032. The Department will continue to provide detailed reporting as required by federal requirements and to the legislature as it has done so in the past. The Department would ask that clarification is added to the definitions to make it such that the Department, and the current programs administered by the Department (some of which are for Department of Health programs) are not included in the requirements of Engrossed House Bill 1032. This concludes my testimony, and I am happy to answer an y questions you may have . #9234PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO ENGROSSED HOUSE BILL NO. 1 032 Page 1, line 16, after \" agency \" insert \", excluding the department of human services and state department of health\" Page 2, line 3 , after \" 19-03.6- 01\" insert \", excluding the department of human services and state department of health\" Renumber accordingly #8962Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Transparency Frequently Asked Questions The rising cost of prescription drugs impacts all North Dakotans, especially those 50 and older. That's why AARP North Dakota is supporting two policy solutions to help lower prescription drug costs: wholesale importation and transparency. Prescription Drug Cost Transparenc y Q. What is transparency? A.Transparency bills require pharmaceutical companies to provide specific information about their pricing practices. Transparency legislation generally requires pharmaceutical companies to provide information about how a drug is priced, and to justify large price increases (or launch prices) that exceed a predetermined threshold. Q.What does a transparency law mean for consumers? A.Transparency bills, while by themselves do not reduce prescription drug prices, are important building blocks for other legislative efforts that can more directly address costs. In addition, transparency laws may provide consumers with advance warning of increases in their drug costs, allowing consumers to discuss lower cost alternatives with their health providers. Moreover, in order to avoid reporting requirements set forth by transparency laws, manufacturers may limit their price increases to keep them below the reporting threshold. The principle behind the bills is that increased disc losure around pricing practices will result in more meaningful and actionable information for states and accountability for manufacturers. Drug pricing transparency legislation will also help payers determine whether a drug price or price increase is just ified. #9263 Q. Where has this state legislative policy been enacted? A. In 2016, Vermont passed the nation's first transparency law, which has led to many state legislatures considering bills requiring more disclosure and transparency from drug manufactur ers. In total,12 states (CA, CT, CO, ME, MN, NH, NV, MD, OR, TX, VT, WA) have enacted drug transparency laws. In 2019, approximately 27 states filed 53 bills on transparency with 6 states (CO, ME, NV, OR, TX, WA) successfully passing Rx transparency laws i n 2019.

I appreciate your time today and look forward to working with you on an issue that is crucial to our members . Transparency bills, while by themselves do not reduce prescription drug prices, are important building blocks for oth er legislative efforts , that can more directly address costs. In addition, transparency laws may provide consumers with advance warni ng of increases in their drug costs, allowing consumers to discuss lower cost alternatives with their health providers. Moreover, in order to avoid reporting requirements set forth by transparency laws, manufacturers may limit their price increases to keep them below the reporting threshold. The principle behind the bills is that increased disclosure around pricing practices will result in more meaningful and actionable information for states and accountability for manufacturers. Drug pricing transparency legislation will also help payers determine whether a drug price or price increase is justified. In an article from the Na tional Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP) shows that laws like these provide valuable information - including information about consumer impacts - that can help the state drive down prescription drug costs. For example - the reporting Nevada requires m ostly around diabetes drugs shows \"Financial assistance to consumers accounted for 14 percent of the manufacturers' estimated total revenues after rebates, although most manufacturers reported offering no financial assistance . #9264 -North Dakota Information like that can be gleaned from transparency bills like HB 1032 and similar information can help formulate ideas to directly impact prescription drug costs. Here is the believe that the tw o points should be clarified and added to the bill as possible amendments. We would like to suggest adding a definition for Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) unit under Section 1 as follows: \"Wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) Unit\" is the lowest identifiable quantity of the drug or biological that is dispensed, exclusive of any diluent without reference to volume measures pertaining to liquids. If reporting by drug group as indicated by [the State Agency], it is the total number of WAC units in the drug group. Next , under section 2, subsection A, at the top of page 3 is unclear because it does not set a timeframe for the cost of the drug. Meaning, it states \"a cost of $70 or more \" but does not say whether that $70 is incu rred for one pill, one month's supply or one year's sup ply. We believe the language should be clarified to specify the timeframe. In addition, we'd like to suggest adding per WAC unit to line 6, acquisition cost of seventy dollars or more per WAC unit for a manufacturer -packaged drug, under Section 2, subsection a on page 3. Also, and more importantly, we believe an independent board or committee should receive the report and that the report should be presented in a way consumers can understand it. Ma ybe the State Board of Pharmacy has time to receive this report, sort through it and make it understandable. But we think the Board likely already has enough to deal with. A transparency bill should be about getting information to the general public in a w ay that interested North Dakotans can not only access it, but understand it. An independent board should review prices and allow for consumer review and input. We appreciate your consideration of our suggested amendments . Thank you again for your thoughtful work on this importation issue. We urge a favorable recommendation on HB 1032.

Hardy, PharmD Executive Director House Bill No 103 2 - Prescri ption Drug Cost Transparency Senate Human Services Committee - Sakakawea Room 10:30 AM - Tuesday - March 16th 2021 Madam Chair Lee, Members of the Senate Human Services Committee for the record I am Mark Hardy, PharmD, Executive Director of the North Dakota State Board of Pharmacy and I thank you for providing me the opportunity to offer testimony on HB 103 2 relative to prescri ption drug cost transparency . The Board of Pharmacy has been engaged with the Interim Health Care Committee on this bill draft which is now before your committee. The Board of Pharmacy certainly understands and respects the desires of many to bring transparency to prescription drug costs. We are monitoring many of the initiatives taken by other states , similar to this bill draft, to address the public and patient's concerns with the continued escalation of drug pricing. We, the Board and profession of Pharmacy , found particularly troubling, the testimony we heard during the Interim Committee on the huge amount of prescription drug costs that were attributed to rebates shared between manufacturers and P harmacy Benefit Managers [PBMs]. The Trump Administration and Center of Medicare through the Medicaid Services has taken notice of these rebates in their recent executive orders . The Board of Pharmacy stands ready to act on any legislation that the Legislature implements on this topic . The Board does have deep concerns with the tenets of this bill. The amendments made on the House side made this bill a much larger undertaking, with the addition of Wholesalers, Pharmacies and Pharmacy Service Administration Organiza tions [PSAO s]. The data reporting would prove to be an extensive and extremely expensive software programming that the Board of Pharmacy would undertake to implement this legislation which this amended version would require. We also need to point out that there is no funding mechanism in this legislation that would assist the Board of Pharmacy in this complicated endeavor . #9274 We were not asked for a fiscal note. However , we would anticipate that we see 1- 2 additional employees would be needed to collect and monitor the information this Bill requires . There will also be extensive costs associated with a program med system that would be, hopefully, electronically captur ing this information, including pricing and descriptions . Lastly, we would b e expected to transmit the appropriate information /data to the ND Insurance Commissioner's Office. As the Board of Pharmacy is a self -sustaining licensing agency, our only option for revenue is through licensure fees. We would have some opportunity t o administratively raise some pharmacy licensure fees. However, it would probably not be sufficient to cover the costs this Bill would cause the Board to incur. We do feel that drug pricing is and will continue to be an issue that states struggle with trying to enact meaningful legislation as, ultimately the true reform would have to be addressed on a Federal level to achieve any effective change in these convoluted dynamics of entities involved. We have been encouraged by much of the Federal action that has been attempted on drug pricing. However , it remains to be seen how much meaningful change actually occurs moving forward. While everyone points the finger as the various parties involved the true reality of this situation is that the patient care can be compromised when affordability is an issue. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have and hope to be a resource to you in any way you deem appropriate. Senate Human Services Committee HB 1032 Prescription Drug Cost Transparency March 16 , 2021 Kathi Schwan, Volunteer State President AARP North Dakota Chair Lee and members of the Senate Human Services Committee , My name is Kathi Schwan , Volunteer State President, for AARP North Dakota. I live in West Fargo and have been involved in AARP for several years before my current two terms as President. It has provided me a unique understanding of the needs of the 50+ in every corner of ND. I appreciate your time today and look forward to talking with you about an issue that is crucial to our members and one that you've already heard they are passionate about during the first half of the legislative session . Before I get into the reasons we are working so hard to fight the high cost of prescription drug prices I'd like to spend just a moment reminding you who we are and why we are here. AARP is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization with nearly 38 million members. 88,000 of those m embers live in North Dakota - a staggering number when you consider the overall population of our state. A lot of issues touch older Americans and their ability to live safe, independent and healthy lives. Most of our work fits into three areas; helping people choose where they live, remain financially secure and access affordable health care. #9359 -North Dakota The rising cost of prescription drugs hits our members , and frankly all North Dakotans , in all three areas. It's a high priority for us right now, not only at the state level, but at the federal level as well. Let me outline just a couple of the reasons why. The average older American takes 4.5 prescription drugs on a chronic basis. The average annual cost of prescription drug treatment increased 57.8% between 2012 and 2017, while the annual income for North Dakotans only increased 6.7%. The high cost of prescription drugs doesn't just impact Medicare beneficiaries it impacts all North Dakotans, especially those age 50 and older. In AARP's 2020 survey of North Dakota adults, almost 1 in 4 individuals did not fill a prescription they were p rescribed in the last two years. Of those who didn't fill a prescription, 44% of respondents said they had decided not to fill a prescription that their doctor had given them because of the cost of the drug. Further, 65% of them are at least somewhat concerned about being able to afford prescription drugs. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Nearly two-thirds (65%) of North Dakota residents age 45+ are at least somewhat concerned about being able to afford prescription drugs over the next two years. Concern about Affording Prescription Drugs in the Next T\\No Years* 25% 22% 18% 19% 16% Extremely concerned Very concerned Somewhat concerned Not very concerned Not concerned at all PER5. How concerned are you about being able to afford the cost of needed prescription drugs over the next two years? (n=722) 'Not equal to one-hundred percent due to removal of small cells; see annotation for all categories AARP.ORG/RESEARCH \u00a9 2020 AARP ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 12 Increasing drug prices hit older North Dakotans particularly hard. Most Medicare beneficiaries live on relatively modest incomes. A Kais er Foundation study from 2016 shows the median income for Medicare recipients is just over $26,000 - and a quarter of the people hover closer to $15,000. They also have very little savings. Half the Medicare population has less than $75,000 saved up. Their ability to absorb increasingly expensive prescription drugs is nearly impossible. Many people we have talked with recently t ell us they have to make difficult decisions about how to live because of the price of those drugs. One of the most staggering st atistics I've seen is on a sheet included in the packet I handed out. Twenty -eight percent of people, when faced with the cost of the medicine they need, choose not to take it - not to pay for it. That's more than one in four. On that same handout you ca n get a good feel for why they have to make that crushing choice. Near the top of the page are three common illnesses in North Dakota - cancer, diabetes and heart disease - with the number of residents of our state who have been diagnosed. More than 60,000 with cancer and nearly as many with diabetes. Below those numbers are common drugs used to treat them and their costs from 2017 . Please, take note that we've included what those same drugs cost just five years earlier. One nearly doubled, another jumped $ 100,000! There is much talk about the low cost of drugs in Canada. We are familiar with the Canadian reputation for safety standards. However, many ND snowbirds fly to Arizona in the winter. From there, they travel to a city called Los Alg odones, 5 miles south of Yuma, where they find incredible prices on pharmaceuticals they can't afford in ND. Why pay $168 for a single tube of Retina -A for your skin cancer, when you can get two tubes for $2.50 in Mexico ? Or $300 for a single, tiny 30 -drop bottl e of Restasis eye drops when you can pick up a 6 month supply for $25? Many of these products are manufactured in the US, but sold more inexpensively across the border. While this bill does not deal with prescription drug importation , I know you r committee considered several bills that did, in the first half of the session. Transparency bills, like HB 1032, are important building blocks for other efforts, like importation. This bill can help shed some additional light for consumers on what is driving price increases. It lays out specific reporting requirements that can help inform you as policy makers and us as consumers to understand when prices will increase and what drives those increases. It may also shed some light on why we pay so much more here than what you see and hear from snowbirds. The Mexican vendors are so familiar with North Dakotans , they sell NDSU and UND souvenirs in their gift shops. Now, we know states can't solve this problem alone. But there are some things that can be done and we appreciate this committee's willingness to bring t his issue to the forefront. We believe transparency from manufacturers, PBMs and insurance companies can help the state and consumers get a handle on these increasing prices and be prepared for when things are going to change. We appreciate that the bill draft in its current form addresses transparency at all three levels. Fur thermore, the thorough description of what should be disclosed is encouraging. That makes this issue relevant not only to the thousands of individual North Dakotans fighting disease, but it also affects those paying for health coverage and to the state. S pending increases driven by escalating drug prices are passed along to everyone with health insurance coverage in the form of h igher premiums and deductibles. It increases costs for taxpayer -funded programs too - making this a relevant issue for every Nort h Dakotan whether they are taking prescription medicine or not. Thank you again for your thoughtful work on this issue. We wholeheartedly appreciate any effort to make medicine more affordable. This bill is a step in the right direction and we look forwar d to working with you during the interim to make it the best possible bill for North Dakotans.

The principle behind the bills is that increased disclosure around pricing practices will result in more meaningful and actionable information for states and accountability for manufacturers . Drug pricing transparency legislation will also help payers determin e whether a drug price or price increase is justified. Moreover, the added scrutiny brought on by transparency legislation could encourage drug manufacturers to reconsider their standard practice of setting high launch prices and then increasing them year after year. AARP strongly supports increased transparency in the drug development and pricing process and generally throughout the prescription drug supply chain. However, because too much transparency within the drug supply chain can actually reduce competition and lead to higher drug prices , transparency legislation should strike a careful balance between the desire for more information and the p ossibility that such disclosures could harm competition and lead to higher drug prices . How does this work? Transparency bills require pharmaceutical companies to provide specific information about their pricing practices. Transparency legislation generally requires pharmaceutical companies to provide information about how a drug is priced, and to justify large price increases (or launch prices) that exceed a predetermined threshold. A transparency model bill drafted by NASHP (National Academy of State Health Policy) includes the following manufacturer reporting requirement triggers : For brand -name drugs: A 20 percent increase per WAC (wh olesale acquisition cost) unit during any 12 -month period; For generics: A WAC unit price of $10 0 or more, and a 20 percent increase per WAC unit during any 12 -month period; For new drugs: A WAC of $670 or more; and#9361 STOPD GREED CUT DRUG PRICES Now-1/8/2020 2 Used for Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs ) and wholesalers: The state will require PBMs and wholesalers to report on specific drugs identified as being of interest following state review of manufacturer and insurer reports . Some states have also included penalties in their bill language for manufacturers that fail to report. The NASHP model language includes a penalty of $30,000/day. The model language also invokes subpoena authority if reporting entities do not provide the required data or if the data they provide is unclear or inadequate. What does a transparency law mean for consumers? Transparency bills, while by themselves do not reduce prescription drug prices , should be considered important building blocks for other legislative efforts , such as cost review commissions and drug affordability boards that can more directly address costs. In addition, t ransparency laws may provide consumers with advance warning of increases in their drug costs, allowing consumers to discuss lower cost altern atives with their health providers . Moreover, in order to avoid reporting requirements set forth by transparency laws, manufacturers may limit their price increases to keep them below the reporting threshold. Where has this state legislative policy been enacted ? In 2016, Vermont passed the nation's first transparency law , which has led to many state legislatures considering bills requiring more disclosure and transparency from drug manufacturers. In total, according to NASHP data , 12 states (CA, CT, CO, ME, MN, NH, NV, MD, OR, TX, VT, WA) have enacted drug transparency laws. In 2019 , approximately 27 states filed 53 bills on transparency with 6 states (CO, ME, NV, OR, TX, WA) successfully passing the following laws in 2019. Colo rado - HB 1131 requires a drug manufacturer or its agent to provide a prescriber the wholesale acquisition cost of a drug when marketing or providing information on a drug to a prescriber. Maine - LD 1162 requires manufacturers to report annually to the Maine Health Data Organization (MHDO) about drug prices when the manufacturer has, during the prior calendar year, increased the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of a brand - name drug or a generic drug by a certain per pricing unit percentage. Nevada - SB 262 expands existing law, which requires transparency around drugs used to treat diabetes, and requires new transparency for drugs used in the treatment of asthma. The law also authorizes the state to collect monetary penalties for noncompliance. Oregon - HB 2658 amends transparency leg islation passed in 2018 and requires manufacturers of prescription drugs to report to the state any specified increase in price of certain prescription drugs at least 60 days before the date of such increase. 1/8/2020 3 Texas - HB 2536 requires drug manufacture rs to disclose pricing information to the state on drugs with a wholesale acquisition cost of $100 or more for a 30 -day supply, or that increase 40 percent or more over the preceding three calendar y ears or 15 percent or more in the preceding calendar year. Pharmacy Benefit Managers and insurers are also required to make annual reports to the state. All information disclosed will be posted publicly. Washington - HB 1224 requires drug manufacturers to disclose the 25 most - prescribed drugs, the 25 costliest drugs by total plan spending, the 25 drugs with the highest year -over -year increase in spending, and a summary analysis of the impact on drug costs on health premiums. Manufacturers must submit annually a description of the factors used to make the decision to increase the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of the drug and the amount of the increase, along with a justification for the increase. This law also requires a phar macy benefit manager (PBM) to submit an annual transparency report. A number of states that have passed transparency laws are using this legislation as a springboard to establish prescription drug rate review or rate setting commissions. State rate revie w commissions analyze drug pricing data from manufacturers , recommend policy options to the state for decreas ing prices and, in some cases , establish drug price ceilings. AVG. ANNUAL COST The average annual cost for one brand name drug, used on a chronic basis, was around $6,800 in 2017, almost $1,000 more than in 2015. 1 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT? Nearly 80% of every Big Pharma dollar goes to something other than research and development. 3AMERICANS PAY MORE Americans can pay double what similar countries pay for the same name brand drugs.4PhRMA SPENDS BILLIONS Big Pharma spent nearly $169 million for lobbying and more than $6 billion for advertising in 2018. 5NUMBER OF PRESCRIPTIONS The average older American takes 4.5 prescription drugs, typically on a chronic basis. 2Rx PRICE GOUGING vs. 50+ INCOME The average annual cost ofprescription drug treatmentincreased 57.8% between2012 and 2017, North Dakotans only increased 6.7%. 6IN OUR STATE Americans pay among the highest drug prices in the world and many are having to choose between buying the medications they need and other essentials. Meanwhile, brand name drug prices continue to increase at rates that far exceed general inflation. These relentless price increases could force many Americans to pay drug prices that exceed their entire income for a year. 1,2 Stephen W.

We are here in opposition to HB 1032. To be honest with you, we find this bill interesting and well-intended. However, this bill is a beast and does very little (if anything) to lower prescription drug costs. I know there are a lot of individuals from the various industries that will testify to their specific section of the bill. We all want transparency, right? We want the same thing. However , it needs to be the right transparency and it needs to be meaningful transparency. Again, HB 1032 is well-intended but does little to bring about meaningful transparency and actually lower costs to consumers. The bill does require a ton of data to be reported. However , the data is all reported in the aggregate which tells us little to all most nothing at the end of the day. The more important question we have is after we gather all of this information, what are we going to do with it? How can it be used or how will it be used? I am unsure if it can be used in a meaningful way to actual lower costs to consumers. As far as pharmacy is concerned , the pharmacy benefit managers have pushed reimbursement so far down to the floor that our members are willing to show you whatever your heart desires. We are even willing to show you our entire PBM contracts, if the PB Ms will allow us to do so without being sued or kicked ou t of their networks . Madam Chair and members of the committee pharmacy is tired of taking the blame of the high cost of prescription drugs when we have little to do with the actual cost of prescriptions. PBMs and others will tell you pharmacies get \"rebates\" from their wholesalers . The ~ reality is pharmacies receive \"volume discounts \" from their wholesaler based off purchases. These fluctuate month-to-month, are dependent on patient volume as well as which prescriptions practitioners 1641 Capitol Way I Bismarck Email: mschwab@nodakpharmacy .net ------ ~ NORTH DAKOTA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION prescribe. These volume discounts are not guaranteed on a month-to-month basis either. Even if you factor in the volume discounts (which pharmacies are not guaranteed), pharmacies still lose money filling prescriptions for certain PBMs. In full transparency (no pun intended), the main reason we are opposed to this bill is because \"pharmacy\" is going to end up paying for the costs associated with implementing this bill which we wholeheartedly oppose. Let me explain, further. This bill falls in the lap of the ND Board of Pharmacy which regulates and licenses pharmacies, pharmacists and pharmacy wholesalers for example. It is our understanding the ND Board of Pharmacy will need at least one if not two employees to comply with the bill if it were to become law. In addition, the ND Board of Pharmacy will also need a significant data base upgrade which will cost six figures, plus ongoing annual costs. The ND Board of Pharmacy does not receive any state general funds. They are funded through licensing fees mainly from drug wholesalers , pharmacies, and pharmacists. Guess whose fees are going to up and go up significantly to pay for the implementation of this bill? If you guessed the profession of pharmacy, you would be correct. There is already a Senate bill over in the House that requires drug wholesaler fees to increase to help pay for the implementation of that bill. That only puts even more pressure on pharmacists and pharmacies to pay even more in fees for the implementation of this bill. Our members have been reaching out to our office asking \"why is the profession of pharmacy having to pay for the implementation of a bill that touches on so many more industry players and players that have way more to do with the actual cost of prescriptions than we do? I have struggled to answer their questions. In an effort, to wrap my comments up, we support transparency, but it needs to meaningful transparency and transparency that lowers costs for consumers. Again, we mainly oppose this bill because the profession of pharmacy is going to have to pay to implement this legislation. You have other large industry players mentioned in the bill that not only can actually do something about the high cost of prescription drugs but have the means to pay for the implementation of legislation such as HB 1032. 1641 Capitol Tel 701-258-4968 Fax 701-258-9312 Email: mschwab@nodakpharmacy .net I would be happy to try and answer any questions you might have for me today. Thank you for your time and attention. Respectfully, Mike Schwab EVP-NDPhA 1641 Capitol Way March 12, 2021 Senator Judy Lee Chairwoman, Senate Human Service Committee Dear Senator Lee, The Association for Accessible Medicines (AAM) is opposed to House Bill 1032. AAM is the leading trade association for generic and biosimilar manufacturers. Its core mission is to improve the lives of patients by advancing timely access to affordable, FDA-approved generic and biosimilar medicines. North Dakota saved over $914 million by using generic medications in 2019 alone. In fact, 90% of all prescriptions are filled with generic drugs yet these account for only 20% of all drug spending. Unfortunately, HB 1032 will not lead to lower tosts for patients and could result in additional confusion. The bill requires manufacturers to report the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) for every drug sold into the state. However, the WAC has little to do with what a patient pays at the pharmacy counter because that is established by the insurer and pharmacy benefit manager---not the generic manufacturer. Reporting, and posting by the state, of thousands of generic drugs will not provide beneficial information for patients as they have little control over which product of the very same drug will be dispensed by the pharmacy. For example, there are 38 manufacturers of the generic form of Prozac with WACs ranging from $1.61 to nearly $800. However, the patient cost, as established by the insurer and PBM, will be the same at a pharmacy regardless of which manufacturers product is used. The wholesaler and pharmacy have the incentive to purchase the lowest cost generic product and it is this competition that saves patients money. In fact, 92% of all generic prescriptions are filled for $20 or less. Further, the bill requires manufacturers to report an increase in the WAC of 40% over five years or 10% over the preceding 12 months for any drug with a WAC over $70. 'fhis provision will only impact generic drugs-which are not driving the increasing costs of healthcare. Studies show generic drug spending is only 3% of the total of U.S. healthcare costs and brand drugs are 10%. However, this bill will not capture an expensive brand drug costing $10,000 that increases by 9% or $900. But, it will capture a lower price drug costing $2.50 that increases 10% or $00.25. This bill will not result in lower costs for the state or patients.

PCMA is the national trade association for pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which administer prescription drug plans for more than 266 million Americans with health coverage provided by large and small employers, health insurers, labor unions, and federal and state- sponsored health programs. To give you a bit of information on PCMA and what PBMs are and what they do, I am including a document describing this in addition to my testimony. As we stated in the interim committee process, PCMA supports meaningful transparency across the supply chain, including transparency that empowers patients, prescribers, clients, and policymakers to make informed decisions that lead to optimal health outcom es and lower costs. HB 103 2, does not achieve these goals and therefore we oppose and urge you to give HB 1032 a Do Not Pass recommendation. In addition , the House Human Service Committee urged a DO NOT Pass on HB 1032; unfortunately , some of the House members who were not on the C ommittee and did not hear the testimony , made inaccurate statements on the Floor and urged the House to override the Committee and recommendation and pass the bill. The statement s made were: 1.PBM s cause drug prices to increase; 2.PBMs charge as much as 50% of rebates and put those dollars in their pockets - that North Dakota consumers end up paying; and 3.Generic drug prices go up because of PBMs . We would like to refute these statement and set the record straight as follows: #9378APCMA Pharmaceutical Care Management Association 325 7th Street, NW, 9th Floor Washington, DC 20004 www.pcmanet .org Senate Human Services Committee PCMA Testimony in Opposition to HB 1032 March 1 5, 2021 Page 2 According to researchers, PBMs, who are hired by plan sponsors ( i.e. health insurance companies, large employer and other pay ers) to maximize the value of prescription drug benefits, help patients and payers save $9 62 per person per year in prescription drug costs ,1 equaling over $1 trillion over the next 10 years.2 Plan sponsors use these savings to benefit patients by low ering premiums, deductibles, and cost sharing. It is always the drug manufacturer who decides what the price of a given drug will be. PBMs do not set drug prices \u2014rather, PBMs evolved as a means to lower the cost of drug benefits by negotiating price concessions with manufacturers and pharmacies on behalf of plan sponsors, such as large employers, government programs, and insurers. In addition, PBMs lower costs by encouraging use of generics, offering specialty pharmacy services, and helping patients with drug adherence. PBMs would not serve 266 million American through all kinds of health plans if they did not bring down costs. PBMs negotiate rebates from manufacturers of brand name drugs that compe te with therapeutically similar brands and generics. Manufacturers typica lly provide a rebate if their product is \"preferred \" which means it is assigned a copay lower than that of competing products. It must be noted that rebates are not offered on all brand d rugs. Therefore, it is totally up to the manufacturer as to if a re bate is offered, how much is offered and for how long. PBMs are transparent to clients on rebates, in accordance with contractual requirements . Nearly half of employer plan sponsors negotiating to receive manufactur er rebates elect to receive 100% of the rebate amount s and pay administrative fees to the PBM. Other payers negotiate for their PBM s to receive a portion of the rebates. Plan sponsors may negotiate any combination of these payment methods and other provisions, and always have the right to audit their PBMs' performance under their contracts. On average, PBMs pass back 90 percent of negotiated rebates from drug manufacturers, w hich payers use to lower enrollees' and their own health spending. Finally, PBMs always have encouraged the use of generic drugs .

When a generic alternative to a brand drug is available, the generic version is substituted for the branded drug 97 percent of the time, a rate that has been steady since 2013. This would not be possible if PBMs didn't incentivize generics to branded drugs. Here again, the manufacturer sets the price of a prescription drug, not the PBM. Going back to the bill at hand, we feel the need to ensure the protection of competitive and proprietary financial information . Therefore, we are very concerned about the data being collected by the Board of Pharmacy. The FTC issued a letter on this issue when the Mississippi legislature passed a law granting the Board of Pharmacy with the authority to regulate PBMs. \"[b]ecause pharmacists and PBMs have a competitive, and at times, adversarial relationship, we are concerned that giving the pharmacy board regulatory power over PBMs may create tensions and conflicts of interest for the pharmacy board.\" 3 Similarly, t he FTC has opposed regulat ory boards composed of market participants in other industries. In North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission, the United States Supreme Court looked into the question as to whether the state board could decide that a certai n procedure could only be performed under the supervision of a dentist, thereby driving lower priced non- dentists out of the market. The FTC questioned the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners' ability to regulate an industry in which they were active participants noting, '\"common sense and economic theory.... dictate the conclusion that Board actions in this area could be self interested\"4 We believe that the Department of Insurance would be the appropriate agency for such competitive data. The Board of Pharmacy is comprised of active market participants whose access to market sensitive data could result in a conflict of interest and undermine competition in the prescription drug marketplace. The industry worked with various stakeholders in Texas throughout the process there to amend similar language on disclosure. A key amendment included in the final passage of Texas HB 2536 aggregates the rebate information reported by PBMs and health plans before publishing the data. This important clarificat ion protects proprietary, private business and competitively sensitive information. PCMA respectfully requests the insertion 3 FTC letter to Representative Mark Formby, Mississippi House of Representatives, (March 22, 2011). 4 Emory University School of Law, \"Legal Studies Research Paper Series\".

The combined aggregated data from the reports must be published in a manner that does not disclose or tend to disclose proprietary or confidential information of any pharmacy benefit manager or health plan [Carrier/Insurer]\" in the section entitled \"Disclosure of pharmacy benefit manager information\" and the section entitled \"Disclosure of health insurer spending information\" . PCMA also suggests the following language be included so the data submitted to the Department of Insurance is not subject to open records requests, except for the aggregated and de- identified data that is in the published report. Rulemaking - Forms - Services - Records. 4. A report received by the board commissioner is an exempt a confidentia l record as defined by section 44- 04-17.1. North Dakota open records laws have three classes of public records . Given the sensitive nature of the information within this bill's scope, it is more properly deemed \"confidential information\" rather than \"exempt record.\" In addition, PCMA respectfully request s the section involving penalties be either updated or removed from the bill. If anything, administrative penalties imposed by the regulator would be more appropriate to levy than c ivil penalties , especially when reporting to the Department of Insurance. As I indicated above, drug manufacturers are responsible for setting the list price of drugs. No evidence exists to suggest that rebates cause higher drug prices. A study of list prices and rebates for the top 200 most prescribed drugs between 2011 and 2016 indicated that there is no correlation between rebates and list price increases or launch prices for individual drugs. 5 Of these drugs, there were prices that increased significantly, some that increased slightly, and some rebates that were high, and some that were low. Top brand 5 Increasing Prices Set by Drugmakers Not Correlated with Rebates, Analysis prepared by Visante on behalf of Pharmaceutical Care Management Association 325 7th Street, NW, 9th Floor Washington, DC 20004 www.pcmanet.org Senate Human Services Committee PCMA Testimony in Opposition to HB 1032 March 1 5, 2021 Page 5 drugs that offered little to no commercial sector rebate during this time period still increased their prices, and manufacturers are increasing drug prices regardless of rebate levels negotiated by PBMs. Among the top 200 brand drugs by 2016 sales, the launch prices for drugs introduced from 2012 to 2016 were double the launch prices for those introduced prior to 2012. There was no correlation found between the prices and rebates. Again, pharmaceutical manufacturer s set drug pri ces. Therefore, the language on page 3 beginning on line 20 relating to the factors that led to drug price increase will likely yield better information if the language is amended to read as follows: \"A definitive statement regarding the factor or factors that caused the increase in the wholesale acquisition cost and an explanation of the role of each factor's impact on the cost.\" PCMA requests that the due date for annual data collection be changed to July 1 st to ensure comprehensive reporting of information for the preceding calendar year. This request will allow for a complete and accurate accounting of information that by its nature lags at least one quarter behind. Stated differently, while information can be reported on April 1 st of each year, it will not represent complete information for the preceding calendar year. PBMs negotiate on behalf of their clients and consumers to help drive down the cost of prescription drugs by using market -based tools that encourage competition among drugmakers and drugstores. PBMs support and practice transparency that empowers patients, their providers, plan sponsors, and policymakers, so that there is informed decision- making that can lead to lower prescription drug costs. We appreciate your interest and commitment to keeping the costs of drugs affordable for the citizens of North Dakota and look forward to working with you in your efforts to pass meaningful legislation. Thank you for your time and consideration. I'd be happy to answer any ques tions.

It's also our responsibility to help patients access them. To help provide patients with more transparency about medicine costs, PhRMA member companies created the Medicine Assistance Tool, or MAT. The platform provides patients, caregivers and health care providers with information to help them connect to nancial assistance programs for the medicines patients need. MAT also links to member company websites, referenced in company direct-to-consumer television advertising, where information about the cost of the prescription medicine is available. Meet MAT WHAT IS PHRMA 'S MEDICINE ASSISTANCE TOOL? The Medicine Assistance Tool (MAT) is a web platform designed to help patients, caregivers and health care providers learn more about some of the resources available to assist in accessing medicines. These include various biopharmaceutical industry programs oered to those who need nancial support due to their lack of insurance or inadequate prescription medicine coverage. It also helps people learn more about the costs surrounding their medicines, as well as provides resources to help them better navigate their insurance coverage. MAT is not its own patient assistance program, but rather a search engine for many of the support programs and resources that the biopharmaceutical industry has been oering for decades. HOW CAN MAT HELP PATIENTS LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR MEDICINE COSTS ? MAT provides patients, caregivers and health care providers with links to websites, referenced in company television advertising, where information about the cost of the prescription medicine is available. These websites may include information such as the list price of the medicine, out-of-pocket costs and other context about the potential costs of the medicine.HOW DOES MAT WORK ? MAT is a search engine that contains information on more than 900 public and private assistance programs that help patients access their prescription medicines, including some free or nearly free options. To use MAT, go to MAT.org and select whether you are a patient, loved one or health care professional. Next, enter the name of the medicines you, your loved one or your patient are prescribed and then enter your personal information or that of your loved one or patient (i.e. age, location, income, insurance coverage and household size). MAT will produce search results that identify programs and resources that might be able to help you. Any information provided is kept strictly condential and will not be used to for any purpose other than providing the search results. WHO IS INVOLVED IN MAT? MAT was created by PhRMA, which represents America's top innovative biopharmaceutical research companies. There are hundreds of programs oered by PhRMA's members companies to help qualifying patients. PhRMA works in partnership on MAT with health care providers, pharmacists, patient advocacy organizations and community groups in an ongoing eort to make it easier for those with nancial need to access their prescription medicines.#9340 [ medicine \u00ad assistance ~1 tool ~ RFSFARCH PROGRFSS HOPF Learn more at LetsTalkAboutCost.orgLET'S TALK ABOUT COST Today, there are more than 7,000 medicines in development, including 140 personalized medicines. And 42% of new medicines in development have the potential to be personal-ized therapies that can be targeted to specic patients and their individualhealth needs. Nearly half of total spending on brand medicines - the sum of all payments made at the pharmacyor paid on a claim to a health care provider -went to the supply chain and other entities in 2018. Due to negotiations in the market, net prices for brand medicines grew just 1.7%, on average, in 2019, less than the rate of inflation. And spending on medicines for one of the nation's largest pharmacy benet managers (PBMs) grew just 2.3% last year. 91% of all medicines dispensed in the United States are generic copies that cost a fraction of the price of the initial brand medicine. In addition, competition from generics and biosimilars is expected to reduce U.S. brand sales by $121 billion from 2020 to 2024. Unlike care received at an in-network hospital or physician's oce, half of commercially insured patients' out-of-pocket spending for brand medicines is based on the full list price. The market-based Average Sales Price system helps control costs and spending in Medicare Part B. It is estimated that the government and seniorshave saved $132 billion from 2005 to 2017 as aresult of switching to this system. In 2018, Part Bmedicine spending was just 10% of total Part Bspending and just 5% of total Medicare spending.Hospitals mark up medicine prices, on average, nearly 500%. An analysis of 20 medicines also found the amount hospitals receive after negotiations with commercial payers is, on average, more than 250% what they paid to acquire the medicine. The biopharmaceutical industry spends three times more on research and development (R&D) than on marketing and promotion. To put this into context, U.S. biopharmaceutical companies spent $90.5 billion in 2016 on R&D, three times the $28.1 billion spent on marketing and promotion that year. We have a responsibility to not just develop treatments and cures, but to also help patients access them. That's why we created the Medicine Assistance Tool, or MAT. This free search engine contains information on more than 900 public and private assistance programs that help patients access their prescription medicines, including some free or nearly free options. Visit www.mat.org for more information. We are also working to x the health care system so it works better for patients by making sure rebates and discounts are shared with patients at the pharmacy counter, eliminating barriers to innovative payment arrangements and making insurance work like insurance again.

In Opposition to House Bill 1032 - Prescription Drug Cost Transparency March 16 , 2021 Position: The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) opposes House Bill (HB) 1032, which would require significant reporting mandates , will not help patients , could threaten access to needed prescription medications , and potentially chill the innovation of future treatments. Discussions about cost and affordability of medicines are important. N o patient should have to worry about whether they can afford the health care they need. However, the notion that spending on medicines is the primary driver of health care cost growth is false and ignores cost savings that medicines provide to the health care system overall. Medicines lead to fewer physician visits, hospitalizations , surgeries , and other preventable procedures . All of which translate to lower health care co sts. New medicines are making crucial contributions to medical advances and changing the direction of health care as we know it. With more tha n 4,500 medicines in the pipeline (74% which have the potential to be first in class medicines and 42% of which could be personalized medicines ), patients have greater hope than ever before. However, this transparency bill is likely to skew important discussions of policy issues in ways that are systematically biased against innovation and ignores the value of medicines to patients , the overall health care system , and the economy of North Dakota. Proposals to mandate additional disclosure of proprietary i nformation by biopharmaceutical companies would neither benefit patients nor decrease health care c osts. The biopharmaceutical industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the United States. Companies currently report extensive information on costs, sales, clinical trials, and total research and development (R&D) expenditures in 10 -K filings . Proposals to mandate public disclosure of additional confidential and proprietary information by biopharmaceutical companies ignore the large amount of information already publicly reported on an annual basis by companies and are based on the faulty assumption that prescription drug spending is the major driver of increases in health care costs. The reporting requirement s for manufacturers do not reflect the total investment of industry because of the long -term nature of research and development. Manufacturers pursue research efforts that include many failures and iterations on the pa th to development of a single approved drug. In fact, according to Tuft's Center for Study of Drug Development (CSDD), only 12 % of medicines in the pipeline make it through the approval process by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1 An 88% failure rate underscores how expensive and risky drug development is. Drug costs are the only costs in the health care system that decrease over time due to market changes , such as brand to brand competition and patent expirations . It is important to note that medicines are the only part of the health care system where costs decrease over time. When brand name medicines face brand competition, or when they lose their patent protection and generic drugs become available, prices drop, often significantly. In fact, it is projected that from 2019 -2023, there will be approximately $105 billion in savings due to competition from generic and biosimilar products as patents for brand #9342STATEMENT RESEARCH PROGRESS HOPE 3 IQVIA Institute Drug Channels Institute 4 Berkeley Research Group (BRG).

However, o ne component of health spend ing that is not decreasing , is health insurance . Instead , it is seeing significant increases. Between 2007 - 2017, d eductibles for patients have tripled and co -insurance has doubled . The Kaiser Family Foundation has routinely show n patient costs are increasing faster than insurers ' costs. Morevover, h ealth insurance and health plan administration costs are rising at more than twice the rate of drug spending. According to new research from the Berkeley Research Group (BRG), rebat es, discounts, and fees paid by manufacturers , are on the increase , while the share received by manufacturers has decreased over time.4 In fact, nearly half (46 %) of total spending on brand medicines went to the supply chain and other entities in 2018. This is a 13%- point increase from 2013 , when other stakeholders retained 33 % of brand medicine spending . This data reaffirms that we need to look at the entire sup ply chain in order to solve patient affordability challenges . Misaligned incentives must be fixed in the supply chain, including the broken rebate system, to ensure patients benefit at the pharmacy counter from the significant discounts and rebates. In addition, brand and generic biopharmaceutical companies, unlike other sectors of health care, generated $41 million in rebates to the State of North Dakota and federal government in 2018 . This is 55% of the t otal Medicaid spend ing on prescri ption drugs in the state.5 If the intent of HB 1032 is to improve access and affordability to needed medicines, the language of the bill is misguided. The legislation does nothing to address how much consumers ultimately pay for a medicine , an amount determined by insurers , not biopharmaceutical companies. This legislation should do something to help patients afford their prescription medicines, such as passing on the rebates directly to the patients at the point of sale at the pharmacy counter . Instead, these rebates are going to the plans and other supply chain stakeholders. Recent data shows that insurers are increasingly requiring patients to pay exorbitant out -of-pocket (OOP) costs to access the medicines they need, far more than other health care services covered by an enrollee's health plan. A recent IQVIA study that looked at OOP patient spend ing for brand name medicines from 2015 - 2019 and showed that patient 's spend on deductibles and co-insurance accounted for more than 2/3 of total OOP spend for brand medicines in five out of seven therapy areas examined . For two therapy areas (oncolo gy and multiple sclerosis), it accounted for more than 90%.6 This occurrence is contrary to the purpos e of insurance \u2014to spread the costs of health care utilization , so that patients can access needed care, including medicines. Today, a patient pays only about 3% for OOP hospital costs , but 13% or more for their medicines.7 Additionally, insurers are incre asing utilization management techniques to aggressively restrict a patient's use of medicine. Currently, three major pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate steep discounts on prescription dr ugs for more than 70 % of all prescriptions filled in the U .S.

That translates into $10 million in both state and federal taxes annually, as well as a total annual economic output of $207 million for the state . The industry is committed to working wi th lawmakers, patients, doctors, and other health care stakeholders to pursue policies that promote manufacturing, R&D , and innovation , while ensuring co nsumers have access to needed medicines. Prescription medicines have transformed the trajectory of m any debilitating diseases and conditions, including COVID - 19, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and heart disease, resulting in decreased death rates, improved health outcomes, and better quality of life for patients. Better use of medicines could eliminate up to $213 bil lion in U .S. health care costs annually, which represents 8% of the nation's health care spending.10 Therefore, instead of focusing on reporting of information that does nothing to help the patient, perhaps the conversation should focus on better use of medicines, which yields significant health gains by avoiding the need for other, more costly, medical s ervices. HB 1032 is not the way to accomplish improved access and affordability, therefore, PhRMA respectfully urges North Dakota lawmakers to oppose this bill . The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) represents the country's leading innovative biopharmaceutical research companies, which are devoted to discovering and developing medicines that enable patients to live longer, healthier and more productive lives.

While I have no doubt that the intentions behind HB 1032 are good, I worry this bill - which is a step towards price controls - would result in a number of unintended negative consequences for patients across North Dakota. The biopharmaceutical industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the United States. It costs more than $2.5 billion and can take over a decade for just one new drug to make it through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process. Piling on more red tape at the state level, such as HB 1032, would only make pharmaceutical development even more difficult. HB 1032 would burden pharmaceutical manufacturers with significant reporting requirements - including the disclosure of proprietary information - that would not accurately reflect the true costs of drug development nor the price paid by patients. This would jeopardize pharmaceutical innovation and access to medicines, as it would result in pharmaceutical manufacturers wasting even more resources on compliance and lawyers instead of research and development for the next generation of lifesaving, life -improving medications. The fact is pharmaceutical development is a very costly and complicated process. This additional government intervention would not do anything to help patients afford their medications. Instead, it is likely to result in the people of North Dakota being left with ev en fewer, lower quality choices, which would actually lead to higher healthcare costs over the long term. The best thing state lawmakers can do to mitigate rising healthcare costs is remove protectionist policies and government -imposed barriers to care . This would promote the competition that spurs innovat ion, improves quality, increases the number of available options, and naturally keeps prices low. ATR opposes HB 1032 and encourages the Senate Human Services Committee to vote NO.

Each day, wholesale distributors work around the clock to ship nearly 15 million healthcare products (medicines, medical supplies, durable medical equipment, etc.) to pharmacies, hospitals, and other healthc are providers daily to keep their shelves stocked with the medications and products they need to treat and serve patients. Wholesale distributors are unlike any other supply chain participants. Their core business is not manufacturing , and they do not prescribe medicines , influence healthcare professionals prescribing patterns, dispense medications to patients, influence patient benefit designs, or set the Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) of medications . Their key role is to serve as a conduit for medicines to travel from man ufacturer to patient while ensuring the supply chain is fully secure and operating efficiently. HDA supports the state's efforts in seeki ng a better understanding of the prices that consumers see at the pharmacy counter. However, wholesale distributors have no insight into patient -level data, nor are they privy to how products are dispensed at the patient level . These quantities vary signif icantly, not just by the type of payor but also the type of healthcare setting to which the distributor is shipping (local pharmacy vs hospital setting). The quantities sold by a wholesale distributor to a pharmacy customer to not align with how other supp ly chain entities calculate and negotiate drug prices. Comparing these two data sets provides misleading and inaccurate information. Further more , North Dakota already has full access to publicly available pricing information reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that would obviate much of the need for wholesale distributors to report pricing data. The National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) data is determined for virtually every drug in the marketplace through a nationwide, pharmacy survey process and is the invoice price pharmacies pay wholesalers for their medication pr oducts. This information is not proprietary, is updated weekly and can be immediately available to benchmark pharmaceutical prices in North Dakota against national drug pricing trends, while at the same time creating a certain level of pricing transparency with very little concern for building out data systems, managing various data streams and contending with numerous confidentiality concerns. In addition to NADAC, each pharmaceutical manufacturer also reports a list price for all products sold in the U .S. This Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC), set by the manufacturer of a drug product, is the \"list price\" that wholesalers are charged for the purchase of all drugs. WAC is reported in various published compendia, such as #9435 HDAQJ Healthcare Distribution Alliance PATIENTS MOVE US. 901 North Glebe Road, Suite 1000, Arlington, VA 22203 Main (703) 787-0000 Web www.hda.org First DataBank and Medi -Span, tha t the state likely already has access to in order to invoice manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) and any supplemental rebate programs. Ultimately, unlike other supply chain entities, wholesale distributor operations do not influence the price a patient pays for their medication . In fact, t he efficiency and streamlined distribution and the storage, security and financial services offered by wholesale distributors generates between $33 and $53 billion in estimated cost savings each year to our nation's healthcare system. We ask the committee to vote down HB 1032 , which would add add itional costs onto the state while not achieving it's ultimate intent of redu cing the costs of medicine. We welcome the oppor tunity to provide additional information or contex t to the committee on the wholesale distribution industry and the role our members play within the supply chain, p lease contact me at (303) 829-4121 or LLindahl@hda.org to discuss this issue further.

Schatz, President 1100 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Suite 650 Washington, D.C. 20036 ccagw.org TESTIMONY SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD ON HB 1032 - PRESCRIPTION DRUG COST TRANSPARENCY NORTH DAKOTA SENATE COMMITTEE ON HUMAN SERVICES THOMAS SCHATZ PRESIDENT COUNCIL FOR CITIZENS AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE MARCH 15, 2021 #9236 COUNCIL for CITIZENS AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE 2 The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) is a private, nonpartisan, nonprofit, organization representing more than one million members and supporters nationwide, with 4,461 members in North Dakota. CCAGW's mission is to uncover, publicize, and eliminate waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement, and inefficiency in the federal government. Founded in 1984 by the late industrialist J. Peter Grace and syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, CCAGW was established to follow up on the work of the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, also known as the Grace Commission. CCAGW appreciates the ability to submit comments on HB 1032. CCAGW is concerned that HB 1032, which is intended to provide prescription drug cost transparency, is nothing more than a fishing expedition that will fail to lower the costs of drugs in North Dakota. Instead, it will raise costs and burden pharmaceutical manufacturers, insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, hospitals, and pharmacies with busy-work activities, and require the hiring of additional accountants and lawyers to provide accurate information in a limited time frame. This will reduce the amount of money needed for research and development of life-saving drugs like the vaccines for COVID-19, and the additional costs of compliance for the other stakeholders, including the state board of pharmacy, will be passed on to consumers and taxpayers. Furthermore, this bill was reported back from the House Human Services Committee as \"do not pass\" by a vote of 12 to 2. Using the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of $70 or more to determine the 40 percent increase after five calendar years or the 10 percent-plus increase trigger within a year for reporting a price hike as required in HB 1032 is a faulty premise because it represents the list price and not what the patient usually pays. The reams of data that will be required to be reported include proprietary information, which if it becomes public would be available to competitors, undermining competition. Having this material published on the website would likely interfere with private negotiations that drive down costs. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has acknowledged that disclosure of pricing information could undermine beneficial market forces within the industry, leading to higher, not lower prices. A July 2, 2015 FTC policy paper stated, \"But transparency is not universally good. When it goes too far, it can actually harm competition and consumers. Some types of information are not particularly useful to consumers but are of great interest to competitors. We are especially concerned when information disclosures allow competitors to figure out what their rivals are charging, which dampens each competitor's incentive to offer a low price or increases the likelihood that they can coordinate on higher prices.\" Supporters of a free market understand that the best approach to lowering prices of any product is an environment that fosters competition and innovation, not more regulation and government intervention. It takes 10 to 12 years and an average of $2.6 billion to get a new drug through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process. According to the FDA, 90 percent of all drugs dispensed are generics. Rather than pursuing HB 1032, North Dakota legislators should ask their congressional delegation to continue to hold the FDA's feet to the fire to make sure that generic drugs are approved in a timely manner. The FDA must also continue to adopt modern techniques that streamline and speed up clinical trials and approval processes. In addition, all levels of 3 government should provide an environment that encourages the development of \"me-too\" drugs that provide competition for pharmaceuticals that are still under patent and provide more patient choice. These actions would be a far more effective way to help bring down the price of prescription drugs than passing this legislation. Again, HB 1032 should be opposed. #9401 CVS Health March 15, 2021 Senate Human Services Committee North Dakota Legislature State Capitol Bismarck, North Dakota 58505 Re: HB 1032 Prescription Drug Cost Transparency HB l 033 Biosimilar bill Dear Chair Lee and Committee Members, 1275 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Suite 700 Washingto n, DC 20004 On behalf of CVS Health, I want to express our concurrence with the comments submitted by PCMA: -In opposition (or amend) to HB 1032, the prescription drug cost transparency bill, and -In support ofHB 1033, the biosimilar bill. CVS Health is a different kind of health care company. We are a diversified health services company with nearly 300,000 employees united around a common purpose of helping people on their path to better health. In an increasingly connected and digital world, we are meeting people wherever they are and changing health care to meet their needs. Built on a foundation of unmatched community presence, our diversified model engages one in three Americans each year. From our innovative new services at HealthHUB\u00ae locations, to transformative programs that help manage chronic conditions, we are making health care more accessible, more affordable, and simply better. CVS Health has six retail pharmacy outlets in North Dakota, and employs 804 people, including 26 licensed pharmacists who filled 987,000 prescriptions for thousands of North Dakota consumers last year. CVS Health also operates one of the largest PBMs in the country, which manages 3,000,000 prescriptions for North Dakota consumers annually, on behalf of major employers and insurance companies who hire CVS Caremark to control the cost of prescription drugs for their members. It is that effort -to control the cost of drugs for our clients -that brings us to the North Dakota Legislature each session in order to defend the free market principles and tools that allow us to keep the cost of prescription drugs affordable for North Dakota consumers. CVS Health concurs with the comments, concerns, and suggested amendments offered by PCMA. We are particularly concerned about HB 1032, which allows the Board of Pharmacy (Board) to collect competitively sensitive and proprietary information from PBMs and grants rulemaking authority to implement the bill, both of which would be a glaring and direct conflict of interest for the Board and the pharmacists serving on the Board. Please note that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed similar legislation that allowed Board oversight of PBMs and stated that \"[b]ecause pharmacists and PBMs have a competitive, and at times, adversarial relationship, we are concerned that giving the pharmacy board regulatory power over PB Ms may create tensions and conflicts of interest for the pharmacy board.\"1 We 1 Federal Trade Commission, Letter to Representative Mark Formby, Mississippi House of Representatives , March 22, 2011. Available at: https://www.ft c.gov/sites/default/filesldocuments/advocacy documents/ftc-staff-letter-honorable-mark-formby-mississippi-house-represen tatives\u00ad conceming-mississippi/110322mississippipbm.pd f CVS Health believe that the Department of Insurance would be the appropriate agency for such oversight and that this would make HB 1032 consistent with other states that have similar laws in place. The Board is comprised of active market participants whose access to competitive data is a conflict of interest and would undermine competition in the marketplace. We urge the Committee to SUPPORT HB 1033, and to OPPOSE or AMEND, as suggested by PCMA, HB 1032. CVS Health supports: meaningful and actionable transparency for consumers and clients and does not believe HB 1032 acqieves that goal. We look forward to working with the Committee in a manner that was not fully afforded because of COVID-19 restrictions during the interim, so we can help fashion appropriate public policy for the people and businesses of North Dakota. Sincerely, arry Johnson Regional Government Affairs Director CVS Health Pharmacy Services Administrative Organization (PSAO) Coalition 425 W. Capitol Ave, Ste 3525 Little Rock, AR. 72201 501-690-8735 March 15, 2021 Chair Judy Lee Senate Human Services Committee North Dakota Senate Re: Comments HB 1032 - Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Dear Chair Lee - I am writing on behalf of the PSAO (Pharmacy Services Administrative Organization) Coalition to provide comments on HB1032 - Prescription Drug Cost Transparency. PSAOs are optional service organizations that stand in the shoes of local pharmacies in their interactions with pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs). This inclu des working through disputes with PBMs, appealing low reimbursement claims from PBMs, helping to centralize and speed up payment from the PBMs, and executing contracts with PBMs. In short, the PSAOs serve as a back -office staff of the pharmacy to deal with the daily challenges pharmacies face when dealing with the PBMs. The PSAOs charge the pharmacies a transparent, flat monthly fee for providing their service. The PSAO Coalition is comprised of Elevate (AmerisourceBergen), LeaderNET (Cardinal Health), and HealthMart Atlas (McKesson) PSAOs that collectively represent approximately 17,000 of the nation's 22,000 independent pharmacies, including some locally -owned regional chain pharmacies. Collectively , the three largest PSAOs only represent 13 percent of the current prescription volume filled in the U.S. This relatively small concentration does not provide any meaningful marketplace leverage when executing contracts with PBMs on behalf of their pharmacies. Our coalition believes that prescription drug cost transparency is vital to controlling healthcar e costs. We believe that the original , unamended version of HB1032 was a reasonable bill that focused its legislative attention on the PBMs and the health insurers, which are collectively the entities that control every aspect of where and how dollars are spent on prescr iption medications. The amended bill, however, broadened the disclosure requirements to include entities that do not have any direct impact on prescription drug expenses, such as the PSAOs. If such a requirement was put into place, in would cause unnecessary reporting that would increase #9440administrative costs to the state, increase operating costs of the PSAOs, and produce no results in addressing the underlying costs of prescription medications. We are not in support of the amended version of HB1032 and we respectfully request that the committee consider returning back to the original, unamended version of HB1032. Respectfully submitted, Scott Pace, Pharm.D., J.D. Chair pace@impactmanagement.com H B 1032 - Testimony by Dustin Gawrylow (Lobbyist #266) North Dakota Watchdog Network The North Dakota Watchdog Network is in favor of policies that lead to transparency for consumers. Based on the expert reports and testimony previously provided, it appears there is a difference between transparency for consumers and transparency at the wholesale level - and that transparency at the wholesale level may not benefit transparency at the consumer level. The State of North Dakota should work with industry to seek ways to lower costs and increase transparency. Judging by how some insurance companies are in favor of this bill, and other opposed - it appears that this bill is dragging the state into a turf war - and having the state pay for market research that may give some companies a competitive advantage over others. Whenever various players in an industry take different sides on a bill such as this, legislators should factor in who wins and who loses with the proposed legislation. #94412021 SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Human Services Committee Sakakawea Room, State Capitol HB 1032 3/23/2021 A BILL for an Act to create and enact a new chapter to title 19 of the North Dakota Century Code, relating to prescription drug cost transparency; and to provide a penalty.
