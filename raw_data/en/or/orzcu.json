Your food should be safe. But through the food you eat, you're exposed to toxic chemicals called phthalates (THAL-eights) that are used to soften plastics, and in fragrance, inks, adhesives and coatings. Prenatal exposure to phthalates is linked to ADHD, genital malformations in baby boys, and infertility later in life. Phthalates can leach into food\u2014even organic food\u2014through processing and packaging. In fact, the food you eat is the number one source of exposure. Across the U.S., exposure to phthalates is a silent epidemic. Government experts say that up to 725,000 American women of childbearing age may be exposed each day to levels of phthalates that could harm a developing baby. [Click here for the facts on phthalates in our food supply. ](https://www.toxicfreefood.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/phthalates_in_food_fact_sheet.pdf) Despite scientific evidence that has emerged in the last decade, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) still allows the food industry to use phthalates in food contact materials. With the FDA dragging its feet, U.S. food manufacturers must take action to protect kids and families and keep phthalates out of our food. Time to Take off the Toxic Gloves Which gloves contain toxic phthalates that can leach into your meal? We sampled and tested over 120 plastic food service gloves from top distributors and popular restaurant chains in the U.S. in order to answer that question. Our top findings: - Some vinyl (PVC) gloves at McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King restaurants contained phthalates - Two-thirds of the fast food restaurants we visited were using PVC gloves, which contain plasticizer chemicals like phthalates that leach into food - One out of seven PVC gloves contained phthalates Learn more!

[Tell McDonald's to be a market leader and take off the toxic gloves!](https://www.toxicfreefood.org/gloves/) Calling on Food Industry Leaders The food you eat\u2014especially fatty foods like cheese\u2014is the number one source of exposure to phthalates. So we're calling on #1 cheese manufacturer Kraft to be an industry leader and protect pregnant women and kids by eliminating any phthalates in their products. After public pressure, Kraft recently stopped using artificial dyes in its macaroni and cheese. Now it's time to get phthalates out of all of Kraft cheese!
