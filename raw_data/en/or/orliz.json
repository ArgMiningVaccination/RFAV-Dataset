We believe in working together and making life as convenient for our patients as possible. You are welcome to see any and all of us at the convenience of your schedule and you can even hop between locations while maintaining continuity of care. Our founder, Steven Mavros, L.OM., had the same ideas in mind when after 5 years of practice he started the Healing Arts Center of Philadelphia back in 2006. The goal was to bring together in one place a diverse group of integrative medicine providers so a patient would have access to the most well rounded holistic care all in one place. We've since expanded from our main center in Old City and branched out to the Main Line, King of Prussia, Exton and a community style practice in Rittenhouse, to make accessing quality complementary care that much easier. Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Steven Mavros, L.OM. Steve has been an acupuncturist and herbalist since 2001. Though he treats a wide variety of conditions, he has been focusing on female and male fertility since the beginning. Working hand-in-hand with reproductive endocrinologists and often found treating on-site at fertility clinics, Steve has helped pioneer the acupuncture for fertility field in Philadelphia. Steve's commitment to the field, particularly the patient experience, led him to create, host and produce the podcast [Waiting for Babies: Stories from the World of Infertility](http://waitingforbabies.com/). He is also the current vice-chair for the Complementary & Integrative Medicine special interest group at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in Psychology, Steve began his Chinese Medicine training in Shanghai, China at Yue Yang Hospital. He went on to receive his Masters of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine at the oldest acupuncture school in the US, the New England School of Acupuncture. He returned to Philadelphia with the hopes of bringing an integrated approach to hospitals for the betterment of the whole patient. After hitting many walls, he decided to start his own center and partnered with Dr. Silverman along the way. His practice also includes other focuses from infertility including headaches and migraines, menstrual issues & menopause, anxiety, stroke rehabilitation and fibromyalgia. Steve is a Past-President of the Association of Professional Acupuncture in PA and a frequent lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania (SAS and School of Nursing), as well as Drexel University School of Medicine. He's been featured on NBC 10, Philadelphia Magazine (Best of Philly 2017), Philadelphia Family (Best of 2019), Philly Style, and CBS Health Watch for his work with infertility.

Along with being an Acupuncturist, she is a practicing Registered Nurse and has worked with adult, pediatric and infants in the neonatal ICU.

Through regular acupuncture, dietary and lifestyle changes she completely changed her wellbeing, and no longer fits within the criteria of a Fibromyalgia diagnosis.
