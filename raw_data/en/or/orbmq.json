HUGIN The challenges to sustained medical innovation leadership are clear. Ac-cording to a new study published by the New England Journal of Medicine, Asian investments in biomedical research and development have in-creased 51 percent while US, Canada and European R&D expenditures have fallen nearly 7 percent. That's a US$14 billion decline. Those numbers should serve as a wake-up call to leaders in both the public and private sectors. Governments, academia, patient advocacy groups and private sector research-driven companies are all essential parts of a vital medical innovation ecosystem. All need to be healthy and successful for the ecosystem to thrive. Successful collaboration among all these sectors of the ecosystem will deliver new cures for patients, reduce the burden on healthcare systems and grow economies. The impact of biomedical research is striking. Consider cancer. Biopharmaceutical breakthroughs have contributed to a 22-percent drop in American cancer deaths over the last two decades. The number of cancer survivors has doubled in that time\u2014from 7 million to 14 million. Since 1990, cancer patients have en-joyed 50 million additional years of life and gener - ated US$4.7 trillion in additional economic activity, with 83 percent of life expectancy gains attributable to new treatments. Just a generation ago, an HIV/AIDS diagnosis was tantamount to a death sentence. Since innova-tive treatments were introduced in the 1990s, the disease's death rate has dropped by 80 percent, with new treatments responsible for 90 percent of the reduced mortality. Today, in most cases HIV/AIDS is being successfully managed with innovative treat-ments as a long-term chronic condition. But patients aren't the only ones who have benefited from the biomedical research ecosystem. So has the economy. Research-driven biopharma-ceutical firms employ more than 810,000 people directly and support a total of 3.4 million jobs across the country. All that economic activity generates tax revenue. In 2010, the government collected US$3.7 billion on the activity related to the Human Genome Project. With just that one year's incremental tax revenue resulting from the Human Genome, the government recouped 97 percent of its 13-year investment in the Project. But there are still many more health challenges to solve. Over the next 20 years, the number of new cancer cases is projected to increase by more than 50 percent, according to the World Health Organiza-tion. The incidence of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia in the United States will double by 2050. Without new medical innovations that change the course of these diseases, the burden of these condi-tions will overwhelm health systems and threaten economic growth. Curing diseases like these will require substan- tial investments of time and money. Developing the average new drug takes over a decade and costs more than a billion dollars. The risk of failure is high. Hundreds of companies are working on new cancer treatments. Only a fraction of those are likely to produce new breakthroughs for patients. The odds are long, but the returns in longer, healthier lives and stronger economic growth are astronomical. Each one percent reduction in U.S. cancer-related deaths delivers US$500 billion in val-ue to society. Delaying the onset of Alzheimer's by just five years could reduce healthcare expenditures by almost US$600 billion over the next 20 years. The biomedical research ecosystem is closer than ever to achieving those goals. Globally, research-based biopharmaceutical companies spend US$135 billion every year on research and development. Biopharmaceutical company scientists are investi-gating nearly 1,000 treatments that could transform WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR BIOMEDICAL INNOVATORS TO CREATE A VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF SUSTAINABLE BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION ?SPONSOR FEATURE B_intro.indd 2 5/30/14 1:38 PMlife-threatening cancers into chronic, manageable conditions. Another 100 are being developed as potential therapies for Alzheimer's. But converting those research initiatives into new therapies\u2014and keeping the research pipeline fl owing with promising new cures\u2014requires more than science. It requires collaborative, integrated solutions. And it requires policies that ensure the health of our nation's ecosystem of innovation: increased support for the National Institutes of Health's vital basic research mission, a strong, science-based Food and Drug Administration, and the sustainable market-based access and reimbursement for innova-tive medicines today that is necessary to incentivize the long-term, high-risk investment needed for new medical breakthroughs in the future. For the sake of patients\u2014and the broader economy\u2014we must work together to help make this happen. Robert J.

Granted, this is an expensive industry. But it is also one that improves lives, the environment and the economies of developed and emerging countries alike. For the cover section in this, our sixth annual edi-tion of Scienti/f_i c American Worldview , we asked experts from around the world to compare the costs of the industry with the value of its outcomes. /T_h eir analysis paints a panoram-ic landscape of these bene/f_i ts, illustrating not only the di-rect rewards in the foreground but also some of the more subtle gains on the horizon. In addition, we have collected opinions from leading life science /f_i gures on the crucial biotechnology-related issues that bring nations together\u2014problems in desperate need of the solutions science has to o er. And to present a 360-degree view of the worth of innovation, healthcare economists Tomas Philipson and Anupam Jena highlight the value of advances to the inno-vators themselves. We also travel to South Africa to meet Motlatsi Musi, who grows biotech-based crops to feed his family and community on the site of a former mine/f_i eld. /T_h ink an ear of corn tastes sweet? Read Musi's poignant story to appreciate just how sweet indeed. Corn and a range of other biotech-driven harvests crop up in this year's Scienti/f_i c American Worldview Scorecard. /T_h is year's list was compiled using powerful new metrics that unveil a number of intriguing trends, both in the country rankings and the industry in general. In a special section, we cover another global challenge: the ongoing battle against cancer. Louis DeGennaro de-scribes how some voluntary health agencies are taking on a new role in cancer research, while Chad Flaig tells how he and a crew of family and friends used the pow-er of teamwork to combat\u2014and beat\u2014cancer. Also, in a story inspired by a terrible loss, a coalition of top-ranked researchers\u2014Stuart Kau man, Colin Hill, Leroy Hood and Sui/uni00A0Huang\u2014o ers up a \"manifesto\" for transforming medicine and proposes new ways to achieve better out-comes from research. Much of this year's issue underscores the value of team- work. /T_h e boundless opportunities collaboration o ers are especially evident in our on-the-ground pro/f_i le of the bio-tech industry in Brazil. /T_h ere, we /f_i nd experts are taking a creative approach to forging partnerships that bene/f_i t all parties, and it appears that their cooperative spirit will mean big things for Brazilian biotech in the future. As always, our Spotlights give readers a round-the- globe tour of the industry, from Australia to Zimbabwe, and many stops in between. With topics ranging from cutting-edge cosmetics to crop science, these stories demonstrate the multifacet-ed nature of biotech innova-tion today.

CO-HOSTED 1 6/3/14 2:08 PM6 LETTERS / OPINIONS / CRITIQUES CONTROLLING CONTAMINATION As academia and the bio- pharmaceutical industry combine resources to accelerate early-stage in-novation from the bench towards the clinic, as discussed in \" Averting an Innovation Cli \" by Diego Miralles (Scienti/f_i c American Worldview , 2013), a critical opportunity exists to estab-lish support and funding to resolve a problem that has long undermined discovery research: cell-line misiden-ti/f_i cation. An estimated 15-20 percent of cell lines used by biologists are misidenti/f_i ed: meaning that cells thought to originate from\u2014and be representative of\u2014a particu-lar organ or disease are actu-ally di erent. 1,2 In one case, promising results generated from the use of misidenti/f_i ed esophageal cell lines led to at least three grants for the US National Institutes of Health, more than 100 scienti/f_i c publications, 11 US patents and patient recruitment for clinical trials. 3 It saddens me to think about the number of mis-leading discoveries from misidenti/f_i ed cell lines that have occurred in the past 40 years. How far could medicine have advanced without this problem? Could we have cured or have better treatments for cancer, heart disease or Al-zheimer's disease? Unfortu-nately, we'll never know. I also see a silver lin- ing to this issue. /T_h ere is an opportunity to repro-duce projects that are well designed\u2014but based on a misidentified cell line\u2014using an authenticated cell line that is appropriate for the experiment. Many im-portant discoveries could be waiting for such a do-over. Biologists have known about this issue since the 1960s when Stanley Gartler of the University of Wash-ington discovered 18 cell lines that were overrun by fast-growing HeLa cervical cancer cells, 4 which can sneak into cell cultures from pipette tips or /f_l oating dust particles. Even this year, publications appeared that drew conclusions from the cells Gartler identi/f_i ed decades ago, as if those cells were bona /f_i de representa-tions of normal human biology. Part of why this problem /f_l ies under the radar is that a case of mistaken identity cannot be con/f_i rmed by just looking at the cells. At regular intervals\u2014as cross-contamination and mix-ups can occur at any time\u2014one must spend hours and hundreds of dollars for tests of the cell's DNA and other features that can con/f_i rm its true identity. Scientists can also purchase authenticated cell lines from reputable repositories, such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). A strong show of sup- port for the elimination of this problem would be for industry-partnership agree-ments and funding-agency proposals to include provi-sions for cell-line identi/f_i ca-tion testing and acquisition of authenticated cell lines from reputable repositories. Several leading journals now request evidence of cell-line authentication before publication, but the organizations with the vision and /f_i nancial power to direct the research com-munity must now also play their crucial role. It is na\u00efve to assume that misidenti/f_i ed cell lines are only a scientist's problem. /T_h is problem has likely denied us all the treatments we yearned for yesterday and the cures we hope for tomorrow. \u00bbDON FINLEY market segment manager Sigma-AldrichSt. Louis, Missouri 1. Drexler, et 750-751 Gammon's \" Machine to Capture Complexity\" (Scienti/f_i c American Worldview , 2013) drew attention to the power of mass spectrometry for improving our funda-mental understanding of human health. Driven by innovation, this analytical technique has seen a spec-tacular rise in use since the invention of electrospray ionization in the 1980s\u2014a \"so/f_t \" or gentle ionization technique that, for the /f_i rst time, allowed researchers to analyze biomolecules like never before. In my view, mass spec- trometry is as much about breaking down complexity as it is about \"capturing complexity. \" And that was never more evident than at this year's ProteoMMX 3.0 Symposium on quantitative proteomics held recently in Chester, England. As a science, pro- teomics is advancing rapidly, thanks to mass spectrometry. One scientist at the symposium showed how mass spectrometry has helped her study the mitochondrial protein content of cardiac cells as a biomarker of cardiac disease. To think that we are getting to the point of understanding which sets of mitochondrial proteins, and their comparative lev-els, are important enough to track over time as indicators of heart health is mind-blowing; it was the stu of dreams just a few years ago. /T_h e research It is na\u00efve to assume that misidenti ed cell lines are only a scientist's problem.

Gammon's article described one type of mass spectrometry. Today, for-tunately for scientists (and for science), they have quite a range of choices available to them. Whether looking at entire proteomes or in-dividual proteins, breaking down complexity is the task of a mass spectrometer. And not all mass spectrom-eters are created equal. Take, for example, elec- tron transfer dissociation (ETD). It is catching on as a technique for transferring electrons to a protein or peptide backbone and caus-ing the peptide to fragment. Equipped with ETD, a mass spectrometer can provide a more complete and ac-curate picture of protein structure than previously possible. A recent paper de-scribes the first use of ETD combined with a high-res-olution mass spectrometer for the surface mapping of intact protein complexes. 1 Today, scientists in all fields have many more and better mass spectrometry options available to them than ever before. Contin-ued innovation will bring to them new capabilities and higher performance. \u00bbJAMES LANGRIDGE director, health sciences Waters CorporationMilford, Massachusetts 1. Lermyte, F. et al. J. Am.

SCIENCE FOR THE SUFFERING In a letter to Scientific American Worldview, 2012, Annalisa Jenkins of Merck Serono discussed the work her company is doing to address unmet medical needs in Northeast Asian countries. Merck Serono, she wrote, will increase R&D spending in the Asia Pacific Region by 45 per - cent. This is gratifying and encouraging, and I applaud them for their initiatives. It also serves as a reminder of ongoing challenges in other areas of Asia and the world\u2014finding treatments for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), such as Dengue fever, hookworm, onchocerciasis (river blindness) and lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis). More than one billion of the world's poorest people\u2014one sixth of the world's population\u2014are infected by at least one of many forms of NTD, and 149 countries and territo-ries are affected by at least one NTD. Victims of these diseases lose, collectively, approximately 50 million years of life, and NTDs kill an estimated 534,000 people every year. Typically spread by in- sects, contaminated water or soil, NTDs are a group of infectious diseases that most often appear in eco-nomically poor countries. They are debilitating and disfiguring and persist for years, even decades. They affect populations that can-not provide the economic incentives for research into new treatments and diagnostics. They are called neglected because they have been largely wiped out in the more developed parts of the world and persist only in the poor - est, most marginalized communities and conflict areas. In addition to caus-ing physical and emotional suffering, these diseases hamper a person's ability to work, keep children out of school and prevent families and communities from economically thriving. We have been study- ing these terrible diseases at New England Biolabs, where more than 30 years ago, our founder Don Comb formed a parasitol-ogy unit to apply molecular tools to help eradicate them. There has been prog- ress. Many drug discovery companies and consor - tiums, such as DNDi (Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative), have contributed to the study of these diseases. Collabora-tions with them and fund-ing from the US National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organiza-tion, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other worldwide sources have helped to move proj-ects forward and translate potential results to human populations. Nevertheless, we have far to go. For example, evi-dence suggests resistance is developing to existing drugs for many veterinary filarial nematodes, as well as the treatments of lym-phatic filariasis (a parasitic disease caused by round-worms). No new anti-filarial drugs have been marketed in more than 20 years. For this reason, we joined the Anti-WolbachiaConsortium, a worldwide network of industrial and academic laboratories studying disease biology and with the goal of im-proving current treatments by reducing the time frame and efficacy of current treatments. We highly encour - age other labs and drug development companies to contribute to the global community. Just as our medical brethren can provide first aid and serve in organizations such as Doctors Without Borders, our training, knowledge and experience endows us with the potential to dis-cover treatments for those whose suffering has been neglected. \u00bb BARTON SLATKO senior scientist Genome Biology Division New England BiolabsIpswich, MassachusettsWe highly encourage other labs and drug development companies to contribute to the global community. B_intro.indd 7 5/30/14 11:08 AMSPONSOR FEATURE STAYING STRONG We associate growing old with slowing down and falling apart. But don't tell that to Olga Kotelko, who started competing in track and field when she was 74 and at age 94 takes part in 11 track and field sports. Olga trains hard and flies across the globe to compete against athletes almost half her age. She's collected 750 gold medals and has broken 26 world records. In What Makes Olga Run?: The Mystery of the 90-Something Track Star and What She Can Teach Us About Living Longer, Happier Lives(Henry Holt, 2014) author Bruce Grierson interviews Kotelko and her doctors to try and uncover the fac-tors behind her fine physical fettle. It is more than lifestyle alone. Her active longevity appears to be a mix of smart habits and great genes. Russell Hepple, a researcher on aging at McGill University who has studied Kotelko extensively notes, \"She's remark-able by every criteria that we measured. She has the capability of somebody close to 30 years her junior.\" Kotelko has actually gotten stronger since she turned 90. Hepple has concluded that while she trains hard and is constantly moving, her activity level is only part of the explanation. In two years between tests, she lost virtually no wind and no strength, even though she had cut back her training. That seems to bear out Hepple's hunch that some-thing else is going on in the muscle, irrespective of exercise effects. Hepple and other exercise physiologists who have worked with Kotelko note that she is free of sarcopenia, a decline in muscle mass and strength that is the hallmark of aging and one of the most significant triggers for age-related disabilities. Sarcopenia is, in fact, the most important cause of age-related frailty that you never heard about. There wasn't a term for the process until 30 years ago and doctors only recently came to an agreement about its clinical definition. For a long time muscle loss was virtually ignored by the medical community as public attention focused much more on osteoporosis. Dr. Claudia Kawas a neurologist at University of California, Irvine and the director of what's known as the \"90+\" study, has been collecting data about the diet, exercise, vitamins and activities of thousands of seniors living at Leisure World (now known as Laguna Hills) for the past 20 years. The study had originally asked \"What kind of shape will we be in if we do live past 90?\" In analyz - ing the research results it became clear that the real question was \"what kind of shape do we have to be in if we want to increase our chances of living longer?\" Kawas recently told 60 Minutes, \"It turns out that the best thing to do as you age is to at least maintain or even gain weight.\" People who were overweight or of average weight outlived people who were underweight. But there's a catch: It's not just how much you weigh, but how you maintain or gain weight. While the 90 + study hasn't studied the muscle health-longevity link, many scientists, curious about the role weight gain plays in living longer, have carried out such research. Why is muscle important? Because loss of muscle mass and strength leads to frailty. People who are frail fatigue easily, are physically inactive, and have a slow\u2014and often unsteady\u2014gait, with an \u00a9 Clifford White/Corbis B_intro.indd 8 6/6/14 1:11 PMincreased risk (and fear) of falling. The consequenc- es of frailty are serious: Frail individuals have many associated medical conditions, including depression, which ultimately lead to a reduced life expectancy. Sarcopenia is an important biological process underlying frailty. We begin to lose lean muscle mass between 30 and 40 years of age. By age 50 the pace of muscle mass loss increases to 1 to 2 percent per year. After age 60 the decline accelerates to as much as 3 percent per year and after age 75 sarcopenia progress faster still. Sarcopenia increases the risk of not just frailty, but physical disability, poor quality of life, and death. Scientists have not established exactly how and why, but they have shown that the amount of muscle plays a central role in whole-body metabolism, which is particularly important in the response to stress and the ability to fend off age-related diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In particular, researchers have found that muscle has an underap-preciated ability to produce a number of immune responses and healthy growth factors that sustain the function of the heart, liver, lungs and the brain. Research has also identified some of the biologi- cal sources of sarcopenia. One key factor promoting loss of muscle-related weight as we age is a protein called myostatin. Myostatin affects the cells and pathways responsible for muscle growth and regen-eration. The older we get, the more myostatin we produce. As myostatin levels increase, it blocks the production of cells responsible for the lean muscle repair and growth. In turn, the reduction in lean muscle regeneration leads to increased fat deposits and fibrosis in muscle tissue. The good news is that sarcopenia is preventable and reversible. Exercise is a key component in the fight against sarcopenia. Physical activity appears to reduce myostatin levels, which restores a healthy balance between muscle mass and fatty tissue. A healthy diet and a proper amount of protein are also essential for muscle development. While exercise and better nutrition are important factors in combating sarcopenia, they may not be enough. A recent article in The Wall Street Journalnoted that several pharmaceutical companies are now trying to develop drugs to regulate myostatin production and help us keep muscle-related weight. In addition, there do exist bio-nutritional prod-ucts\u2014foods that contain naturally biologically active molecules\u2014that reduce the activity of myostatin. The estimated direct healthcare cost attributable to sarcopenia in the United States in 2000 was $18.5 billion. The indirect costs of sarcopenia are likely ten times that because of the role it plays in the progres-sion of costly illnesses. This doesn't count the loss in earnings and value of health from living without sarcopenia-related disabilities. The potential benefit of preventing sarcopenia is hard to quantify. As University of Illinois demog-rapher Jay Olshansky notes, \"Slowing the aging process by an achievable three to seven years would simultaneously postpone all fatal and nonfatal disabling diseases, produce gains in health and lon- gevity equivalent to cures for major fatal diseases, and create scientific, medical, and economic wind-falls for future generations that would be roughly equivalent in impact to the discovery of antibiotics in the 20th century.\" Staying strong could indeed be the penicillin of the 21st century. MYOS Corporation is an emerging bionutrition and biotherapeutics company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of products that improve muscle health and function essential to the management of sarcopenia, cachexia and degenerative muscle diseases. www.myoscorp.com The good news is that sarcopenia is preventable and reversible... exercise and nutrition may not be enough MUSCLE MASS AND STRENGTHAGErange of muscle mass and strength between individualsEARLY LIFEgrowth and development to maximize peakADULT LIFEmaintaining peakOLDER LIFEminimizing loss SOURCE: Age and University Press B_intro.indd 9 6/6/14 1:10 PMPRICELESS Can the True Value of Innovation Investment be Tracked? BY MIKE MAY \"WE NEED TO TRAIN MORE SCIENTISTS BETTER EVERYWHERE.\" That's what Nina Dudnik said at PopTech 2010 in Camden, Maine. Despite talking on a stage in a New England location that Forbes once labeled as one of \"America's Prettiest Towns,\" Dud - nik's thinking started a decade earlier at the Africa Rice Centre in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in West Africa. As a Fulbright scholar, she worked there for a year with local scientists who were developing new strains of rice to feed their people. Biotechnology research, however, depends on equipment, which can be hard to come by in developing countries. \"We might have had the only working PCR machine in the whole country,\" Dudnik recalls. 10 illustrations by BRIAN STAUFFER C_report.indd 10 5/30/14 10:11 AMFOR WHAT IT'S WORTH 11 After her agritech toils on rice, Dudnik started her doc - toral work in molecular biology at Harvard University. In comparing the labs at Harvard to those in Africa, she says, \"I was struck by the disparity in resources.\" Collaborating with other graduate students, she started making unused instruments available to researchers around the world. After completing her PhD in 2008, Dudnik created Seed - ing Labs, a Boston-based nonprofit organization where she serves as the CEO. Distilling Seeding Labs's core mission, Dudnik says, \"We help scientists in the developing world do life-changing research by providing access to tools, training and networks to do that.\" She adds, \"We make sure that research around the world can get done, and we also help to train the next generation of scientists.\" Dudnik can now do even more, because Seeding Labs recently re - ceived a US$3 million grant from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Dudnik's work underscores the international charac - ter of biotechnology. It can add value in every corner of the world, but to do so scientists need the tools to get the work done. Nonetheless, the value of the results far out - weighs the costs of getting there. As Dudnik notes, \"We are facing enormous problems: a wide range of diseases, food shortages, access to clean air and water and energy.\" She adds, \"We need to make sure that the greatest number of people around the world have an opportunity to tackle these problems.\" QUANTIFYING THE OUTCOMES While the subject of biotechnology's\u2014or, for that matter, any area of the sciences'\u2014short and long-term value is a perennial topic among policymakers, would-be investors and the public at large, a more elusive subject is how one truly quantifies such value. Nonetheless, two recent stud - ies from healthcare economist Frank Lichtenberg of the Columbia Business School in New York attempt to do just that, at least in the areas of medicines and therapeutics. In these studies, Lichtenberg and his colleagues mea - sured the impact of the availability of new medications on overall health in two countries. In \"The effects of phar - maceutical innovation on mortality, hospitalization and medical expenditures in Turkey, 1999-2010,\" the research-ers report that the average lifespan increased by 3.6 years and new pharmaceuticals accounted for 3 of those years. In addition, Lichtenberg calculated that the cost of adding one year of life in Turkey through new medicines was US$2,813. Even if their modeling is off and the new medicines only provide about half as much of an increase to a person's life, the researchers say that buying an ex - tra year of life with new medicine couldn't cost more than US$5,000. As they write, \"Even the latter figure is a very small fraction of the leading economists' estimates of the value of (or consumers' willingness to pay for) a one-year increase in life expectancy.\" For comparison, many sources value an extra year of life at US$100,000-150,000, and many people would pay much more for it if they could. In \"The potential contribution of increased new drug use to Russian longevity and health,\" Lichtenberg reveals that Russia could easily extend the average lifespan by pro - viding advanced drugs to its citizens. In the period 2000-2010, for example, Lichtenberg points out that Russia only provided its citizens with half of the new drugs that came on the global market during that time. If it had provided as many of these drugs as other counties did, according to Lichtenberg's modeling, the average lifespan for the aver - age Russian would have increased by 2.1 years. Although new medicines can increase lifespans, they sometimes are not fully deployed. For example, Jeffrey P. Kemprecos, executive director of public policy and corpo - rate responsibility for MSD Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, notes, \"Following the global financial crisis and economic slow down in Turkey, the government conc - luded that it was compelled to impose cost containment, starting in January 2010. The measure inevitably covered pharmaceuticals, so the introduction of new molecules plummeted from 2010 till today.\" To add 3.6 years to the average Turkish lifespan, the go - vernment approved dozens of new drugs in the first decade of the 21st century. \"In the past four years,\" says Kemprecos, \"only two new molecules have been approved.\" He adds, \"As research-driven organizations, we are today questioning the impact of cost containment measures in terms of human life: Would the Turks be living healthier lives and a full year longer had the cost containment been more balanced and allowed new medicines to come to the market?\" Answers to such questions lie in studies like Lichten - berg's. With them as guides, governments might make more informed decisions relating to gleaning biotech - nology's benefits. \"We have always been there to support research to have an informed policy discussion,\" declares Kemprecos. \"If we believe in the value of our products and investments we've made in innovation, we need credible data and policy research to support our value proposition.\" SUCCESS FROM SEQUENCING \"One thousand years from now, people will look back at the year 2000 as a defining moment in our history,\" says G. Steven Burrill, CEO at Burrill & Company in San Fran - cisco. \"Sequencing the genome and understanding life at the base level will have changed everything with respect to healthcare, what we grow and where we grow it, and energy production.\" C_report.indd 11 5/30/14 10:16 AM12 illustrations by BRIAN STAUFFER Much of the value of sequencing, though, lies ahead. \"You can't underestimate the power of understanding the molecular basis of life, but we are very early on in applying that,\" says Burrill. \"Maybe 90 percent of the developments have been in healthcare, but there will also be transforma - tion in energy and agriculture.\" While the public might not see that coming, so far, in the eyes of many, they've only seen the big spending on the science. As Burrill points out, \"Lots of people have said, 'We sequenced the genome, but what have we done since then? Where is the designer medicine?'\" At this stage, the science is running ahead of the applications, but the ever more affordable cost of sequencing\u2014soon to be only US$100\u2014will allow nearly everyone to have their genome sequenced. \"Improved diagnostics are already an early manifestation of the benefits of sequencing,\" Burrill says. REWARDING THE RISK-TAKERS To make that leap from scientific discovery to commercial application, someone\u2014or some entity\u2014must take a risk. In biotechnology, says Joseph Damond, senior vice presi - dent of international affairs at the Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington, DC, \"The cost and the risks are largely borne by the people who are developing the products, not by society.\" He adds, \"We have to admire the people out there who are taking these risks.\" The risks certainly do involve a wide range of costs. Innovators face challenges in developing a product and, if it proves viable in the laboratories and after clinical tri - als, getting it approved. In the medical, or \"red\" areas of biotechnology, the clinical trials process is a huge com - ponent of the price. But that's not the end of the financial risk. As Damond says, \"It's expen - sive to manufacture products and main - tain the quality.\" And while gov - ernments do take on a portion of that risk, the bulk of it, particularly on the product develop - ment side, is left to other parties. As an example, Damond says, \"The US National Institutes of Health funds can be used to do research on a disease target, but companies de - velop the drugs.\" He adds, \"That basic work is very impor - tant research, but the NIH is not in the business of devel - oping new medicines.\" Surprisingly perhaps, big companies do not make up most of the biotechnology industry. Damond says, \"There are about 1,000 companies in biotechnology R&D in the US, and the vast majority are small companies.\" He adds, \"Increasingly the drugs are being developed by the small guys. They are the ones taking the risks.\" That risk looms even larger when you realize that most of those companies are still working in the red\u2014hoping to make a profit once they get a biotechnology-based product to market. In some situations, those risks can be reduced. Public- private partnerships, for instance, can spread out some of it. The European Union developed the Innovative Medi - cines Initiative (IMI), which is the largest public-private partnership in Europe. The IMI aims at improving drug development, and it can benefit even small companies. In many cases, the IMI looks for ways to optimize existing technology in creating tomorrow's medicines, and that could be the most effective way to make the process faster and more economical. For the moment, public-private partnerships appear on the rise, especially in Europe. According to SciBX : Science-Business eXchange , \"[a]t least 314 companies and institutions based in Europe were involved in forming new partnerships [in 2013] versus 182 in the U.S.\" This could be particularly important as the number of public biotech - nology companies decreases in many countries (see \"Signs of Resurgence,\" page 54). DATA DEPENDENCIES Clearly, biotechnology is a data-driven and data-depen - dent enterprise\u2014quantifying the impacts of new medica-tions on lifespans, analyzing sequences to create diagnos - tics, and balancing the risk in developing a new product. Despite those powerful outcomes of numbers, the most important and life-changing data surely lie ahead. \"Advancements at the intersection of information tech - nology and biotech - nology could enable us, for the first time, to measure biologi - cal phenomena in more detail,\" says Narges Bani Asadi, CEO of Bina Tech - nologies in Redwood City, California. As examples of these advancements, she points out innovations that are enabling measuring the activities of proteins and microbes in our bodies, analyzing the interactions of medications and lifestyles, and other real time biological phenomena. Intrinsically noting the value these developments will have toward future health solutions, Asadi notes, \"We are start - ing to be able to measure all of this in an economical fash - ion, and this is very empowering.\"\"You can't underestimate the power of understanding the molecular basis of life, but we are very early on in applying that.\" \u2014G. Steven Burrill C_report.indd 12 5/30/14 10:27 AMFOR WHAT IT'S WORTH 13 \"There's less risk appetite among investors who traditionally invest in bio- technology,\" says Andrew Lo, a financial economist at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. When cancer struck some of his close friends and fam-ily, though, Lo got an idea. \"It's a really straightforward idea,\" he says. \"I want us to be able to take multiple shots on goal.\" By that, he means trying many ways at once to cure cancer . As he says, \"If you have multiple proj-ects within a single financial investment vehicle, it is more likely to earn a decent rate of return from just one or two successes.\" Based on data about the historical success of clinical trials, research costs, and product returns, Lo and his colleagues calculated that a fund of, say, US$500 million focused on curing rare diseases such as certain types of pediatric cancer could generate a return of 8-15 percent, while taking many shots on the cancer-curing goal. \"That might not get venture capital-ists excited, but it will get pension funds excited,\" he says. It's a creative way to finance research, and it could work beyond cancer . Even today, much of medical research remains trial and error. Instead of randomly searching for a compound that works for a specific disease, today's tools allow a data-driven approach. As Asadi explains: \"If you have measure - ments from a person throughout their life and integrate it with other individuals, that is a huge transformation.\" Those data could reveal more successful pathways to de - veloping new medications. Pushing data to this level of application, though, de - mands integrated teams around the world, including high-performance computers and experts to build and operate the systems. Equally sophisticated systems must be devel - oped to acquire and upload the data, although smart de - vices will certainly make that far easier. Despite the complexity and cost of building such a sys - tem, the value could be nearly priceless. As Asadi says, \"I hope that this type of advancement in the industry will create more data sets that can be aggregated, and then bio - technology will become more efficient and economical.\" She adds, \"Then, the value of biotechnology will really in - crease for society.\" IT'S PERSONAL If there were to be a corollary to the phrase \"all politics is local,\" it might be: \"All innovation is personal.\" To some - one walking on the street in a developed country, the value of biotechnology might seem remote, perhaps relevant only to a farmer in some distant developing country look - ing for a miraculous way to grow corn where it never grew before. Indeed, biotechnology can help those farmers (see \"Growing Optimism,\" page 22), but when an oncologist diagnoses you or one of your loved ones with cancer, the benefits of scientific investment turn instantly personal (See \"A Team Attack,\" page 32). Likewise, close encounters with cancer spurred financial economist Andrew Lo of MIT to find a new way of funding research (See \"Funding on the Frontier\"). Nonetheless, there's more work for this science to do. According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1,600 Americans die from cancer every day. The United Nations's World Food Programme reports that \"842 mil - lion people in the world do not have enough to eat.\" Our planet also faces deepening energy concerns. The Inter - national Energy Agency reports that \"the world's energy needs could be 50% higher in 2030.\" All of these issues can turn personal for any of us. \"There is no magic bullet for solving the world's prob - lems,\" remarks Dudnik, \"but biotechnology is an impor - tant tool\u2014not the only tool, but a valuable one.\" To use that \"tool\" in the most effective way, people and companies and countries around the world must invest. \"The cost of the tools is far outweighed by the potential long-term benefits,\" says Dudnik. A growing database already shows the value of biotechnology, but the data must continue to be collected. The benefits must be explained more carefully, more often and more widely. Only then can people from all corners of the world participate in and benefit from this resource-in - tensive, and ultimately highly valuable field of exploration.FUNDING ON THE FRONTIER C_report.indd 13 5/30/14 10:18 AM14 illustrations by BRIAN STAUFFERHealthcare absorbs an ever-growing percent - age of national income and public spending in many developed coun - tries. In the United States, for example, healthcare expen - ditures escalated from 7 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1970 to almost 20 percent in 2013. Across member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, health - care expenditures more than doubled from an average of 4.9 percent of GDP in 1970 to over 10 percent today. Given the financial squeeze of in - creasing healthcare expenditures on public budgets, governments must decide whether to allocate scarce public dollars toward healthcare or other investments important to so - ciety, including education, defense, retirement benefits or public infra - structure. In order to make these difficult decisions, however, policy - makers need to understand the value of spending money in each of these areas. Is the dollar value that Ameri - cans place on additional investments in healthcare greater or less than the value they place on additional invest - ments in all other areas in which the government can invest? Deciding whether to devote more or less to healthcare depends critically on the ability to accurately quantify the value of health improvements that greater spending provides. Without being able to quantify the value of im - proved health, it is impossible for poli - cymakers to decide whether invest - ments in the health sector are worth it. NEEDING NEW NUMBERS The science of valuing and measur - ing the worth of healthcare has a long tradition and is constantly evolving. In fact, health economics expends much of its efforts on precisely this area. Nonetheless, the approach has been limited in our view. Many pub - lic and private payers use technology assessments to quantify the health impacts of new technologies for their patients by comparing patient benefits from a given technology with spending on that technology. For example, many studies compare spending to quality- or disability-adjusted life years gained. Although such consumer- or patient-based measurements provide a guide to al - locating the often-scarce resources spent on medical technologies, less emphasis has been placed on the ef - VALUE to WHOM?How much are new treatments worth? BY TOMAS J. PHILIPSON & ANUPAM B. JENA C_report.indd 14 5/30/14 10:28 AMFOR WHAT IT'S WORTH 15fect that such measurements have on the behavior of innovators who make healthcare technologies available in the first place. We have explored the impact of innovation on both patients and innovators. 1,2 Although not explic - itly stated as such, patient-based mea - surements of the value of new health - care technologies are concerned with maximizing the gains to consumers rather than producers. From this perspective, a technology's worth de - pends on the value of patient health benefits versus the cost. The gains to patients or consumers, however, might be a poor guide to developing efficient policies to drive new tech - nologies that arise from costly R&D. Rather, the degree to which a produc - er gains\u2014often at the expense of con - sumers\u2014becomes the central issue that determines dynamic incentives to innovate. The importance of producer gains from new innova - tions is the ratio - nale for the patent system, which sub - stitutes producer gains for consumer gains in order to stimulate more ef - ficient R&D investment. Put differ - ently, even though measured levels of patient gains would be larger to - day without patents, since patients or their health plans would spend less to get the same technology, future patients would suffer from a lack of innovation incentives. Unfortunately, the measurement of the gains to inno - vators has greatly lagged behind the measurement of the gains to patients in health economics. The field needs an improved science for measuring the gains for producers of new health - care technologies. UNEQUAL GAINS Consequently, we and others have ex - plored producer gains in healthcare. For example, we have estimated the gains to patients as well as innovators of highly active anti-retroviral thera - py (HAART) for HIV/AIDS. 3 Today, individuals diagnosed with HIV in the United States can have near-nor - mal life expectancies, if they adhere to their medications. In contrast, those diagnosed with HIV in the mid-1980s faced five-year mortality rates of about 80 percent. Our research es - timated that life expectancy\u2014across the more than 1.5 million individu - als diagnosed with HIV in the United States since 1984\u2014increased by nearly five years when averaged across all of these patients (those diagnosed before 1996 when HAART became available, as well those diagnosed after). Using a typical value of US$100,000 for a year of life, improvements in HIV survival have been worth about $750 billion until now (1.5 million times 5 years at $100,000). Including the benefits to future patients would make that number much larger. To date, the gains to HIV patients have swamped the gains to innova - tors, because the drugs have lead to profits of approximately US$5 billion a year, which we have shown accounts for only 7 percent of the total value of these drugs. The point of this back-of-the-envelope calculation is not to ar - gue that it is exact or fully correct but that the difference between patient and innovator gains is very large, a finding that has important implica - tions for whether innovators have the full incentives to innovate. The HIV indication illustrates a more general set of findings that have been repeated in oncology and hy - pertension and many other diseases. 4 Indeed, in our work on HIV drugs, we also used the Tufts Medical Center Cost Effectiveness Analysis Registry to study a large sample of medical technologies, and we found that an av - erage innovator only captured 12 per - cent of a technology's total value. This figure is about half that estimated for other industries, 5 even though health - care is among the most research in - tensive, requiring nearly US$1 billion worth of investment for every drug that successfully makes it to market. Measuring the value of inno - vations can help to guide our un - derstanding of whether healthcare spending is producing improvements that patients value and whether incen - tives are sufficient for innovators to generate new therapies. But in order to understand whether current public policies create incentives for future innovation, it is important to measure how the value of new treatments is divided between the patients who re - ceive them and the companies that pro - duce them. In order for policymakers to understand whether the right incentives exist for innovation, it's important to measure not only the value of new medicines to today's pa - tients but also the gains to producers who make cutting-edge therapies pos - sible for patients in the future. 1.

C_report.indd 15 5/30/14 10:21 AM16 illustrations by BRIAN STAUFFER A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE Food, energy and medicine are among the biotech-related areas people care most about worldwide, but not necessarily in that order Our perceptions of which biotechnology-associated issues matter most have a lot to do with where we live. In places ravaged by drought, for instance, the focus will likely be on biotech's benefits to agriculture. Likewise, for communities with large aging populations, the key concern might be investment in cutting-edge cures for age-related illnesses like cancer. To understand which biotech issues mean the most to people around the world, the editors of Scientific American Worldview asked an international panel of experts one simple question: In your opinion, what are the two most important biotechnology-related issues facing the world today, and why? Their responses are captured here. C_report.indd 16 5/30/14 10:29 AMFOR WHAT IT'S WORTH 17 MICHELLE GALLAHER chief executive of cerBioMelbourne NetworkMelbourne, Australia MG: The battle for tal- ent is the biggest global biotech issue. Experience, high-value networks, track record and sheer commercial talent have become the most valu-able commodities in the biotech market. The sci-ence might be risky, but the executive talent is not. Repeat investing in talent-ed people is not new, but how do new kids on the block get a break? Talent and skills investment in biotech clusters is a good strategy, designed to build an ecosystem of the best and brightest. But for a place like Australia, the question is: How do we keep them here? It will take more than sunshine and shrimp on the barbie. MG: The second biggest issue is global harmo- nization\u2014looking at IP frameworks, legislative freedom for science, access to investment, cost of labor, movement of graduates and early career scientists, and commercialization exper-tise. To generate global opportunities, economic, scienti c, legislative and legal boundaries need to be in harmony to encour-age and reinforce col-laboration, access to new markets and constructive competition. The more harmonious the leading biotech nations are, the faster the deals and col-laborations will fl ow. ROBERT HARIRI chairman, founder and chief science of cerCelgene Cellular TherapeuticsSummit, New Jersey RH: I believe biotechnol- ogy can solve many of the problems facing the world in the 21st cen-tury. Medical innovation will deliver effective treatments and cures for lethal diseases like cancer and help add high-quality years to people's lives. With transformational tech-nologies like synthetic biology, we now have the tools to engineer various products\u2014by using the natural synthetic appa-ratus of living cells\u2014that can solve many of the world's problems, from the production of food to producing medicines to producing hydrocarbons as an energy source. The big payoff is that this is a path to economic stability and, ultimately, prosperity. RH: With the tools at our disposal to interrogate the genome and correlate to the vast array of phenotypic variables associated with health and disease, biotechnology must fully exploit the allied tools in information and high-performance computing. I would argue that the complexity of biology will help to drive big-data handling as much as any other discipline. You see companies like Google and Microsoft and Amazon\u2014with their tre-mendous cloud-computing know-how\u2014 nding their way into biomedicine, in part because they recog-nize this huge computing capability is a game-changer for the biotech-nology industry.REGINA REVILLApresidentASEBIO (the Spanish Bioindustry Association)Madrid, Spain RR: We believe it to be of the utmost importance for all the political and economic actors to hold the conviction that bio-technology\u2014which is not one eld but many: red (health), green (agrifood), white (industrial), blue (marine) and orange (bioinformatics and bio-engineering)\u2014is the right tool to grow and develop our communities in a more socially sustainable manner .

There are great disparities in health across the world\u2014with great differences in what is available to people depending on where they live\u2014that greatly impact life expectancy and qual-ity of life. Biotechnology has created solutions for some diseases, which when distributed based on a successful business model prevent access to many. Biotechnology will provide solutions to many of the world's diseases, especially infectious diseases, which still kill the majority of people on the planet, and diseases such as cancer, which is expected to dramatically rise as the population ages. We must work to create these solutions, and then work to make sure they are widely avail-able to all. HG: Feeding the world in a time of global climate change. The population of the world is still on the rise, and there are still shortages of food and clean water . Biotech-nology can be used to address these issues, to create new types of foods that are both very produc-tive\u2014high yield\u2014and also resilient to fluctuat-ing climate changes, so as to eliminate periodic famine. These foods must be sustainable and not susceptible to dramatic climate shifts and next-order changes, such as new plant diseases or insect impacts. For both of these, we must be able to rap-idly deploy biotechnol-ogy research to new and emerging challenges that Mother Nature regularly introduces.THOMAS HEYDLERchief executive officerDefiniensMunich, Germany TH:We are losing the war on cancer . As an example, in 2014, cancer .orgestimates the US will have 586,000 deaths from cancer . That's more than five times the number of people from the US who died in military action for the past 60 years. Two promising technologies that could dramatically change this are genomics and tissue phenomics. Since cancer fundamentally starts with genome instabil-ity, the ability to utilize the US$1,000 genome for clinical discovery will tremendously enhance our understanding of the origins of cancer .

Although tis-sue images have histori-cally been refractory to big-data approaches, tissue-phenomics ap-proaches, such as the ones used by Andy Beck at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, will yield new diagnostic tests that are essential for bet-ter treatment decisions. These two approaches will be complementary, as today it's not always clear how the gene muta-tions will translate into proteins and tissue. The two together will change the way we diagnose and treat cancer. TH: The second most important biotechnology issue around the world is the merging of information technology with medicine. With applications of big data being applied to consumer spending to understand trends, medical thought leaders believe that big data applied to medicine could help to tailor treatments for personalized medicine approaches.

Subsequently, the development of glyphos-phate-resistant crops allowed farmers to kill weeds without hurting their crops.BIOPLASTICSPlastics made from a range of biomass sources \u2014from fats and starches to peas and corn\u2014 provide many benefits over their fossil fuel-derived counterparts, including sustainability and degradability.

GENERAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTIONKary Mullis developed PCR in 1983 to turn a few copies of DNA into millions. This technique paved the way for new approaches to developing disease diagnostics.DNA SEQUENCINGThe groundbreaking ability to rapidly deter-mine the sequence of an organism's genome is the result of advances made by many scientists, hailing from both academia and industry. The procedure will soon be so inexpensive that it will be available to nearly anyone. Among this process' myriad applica-tions, its incomparable value as a therapeutic tool is sure to make it an indispensible element of tomorrow's medicine.BIO-INFORMATIC TOOLS & IT INNOVATIONSBiotechnology is not always entirely biological, as much of today's scientific research relies on advanced analysis and simulations. Likewise, tomorrow's healthcare will require decision-making tools that allow physicians and consumers to make the most of the growing collection of biological treatments and genomic- and environmentally-based information. INDUSTRY IT AGRICULTURE C_report.indd 21 5/30/14 10:37 AM22 illustrations by BRIAN STAUFFEROnce, my farm was part of a war zone, just south of Johannesburg, South Af - rica. I had to be optimistic to drive a tractor through a minefield, as I did in the aftermath of South African apartheid. In fact, trying something new always re - quires a bit of optimism. Nonetheless, the first time that I planted geneti - cally modified crops, I was nervous. Would they grow? Would they im - prove my yields? Or would they fail, as so many other crops in Africa had before them? Nearly a decade has passed since then, and today I can hardly imag - ine farming without these important tools of technology. Although things are better now in South Africa, life has conditioned many of us to pessi - mism. Why wouldn't it? Two-thirds of all Africans are farmers, according to the World Bank. That's a higher rate of employment in agriculture than anywhere else on the planet. And yet Africa is the hungriest conti - nent. What a cruel paradox: We farm the most and eat the least. BEYOND BEGINNER'S LUCK I've farmed for more than 20 years, starting as an ordinary laborer. In the wake of my country's land redistribu-tion, I own and farm 21 hectares and rent more. One of the biggest chal - lenges for any farmer involves guard - ing crops from pests. In my experi - ence as a farm laborer, my boss used tractors with huge booms to spray the plants. When the corn grew too high for driving, airplanes flew overhead and dropped pesticide. As smaller, independent farmers, we wore pro - tective clothing and carried 12-liter knapsacks of pesticides through the field ourselves, often on tremendously hot days. It was a constant struggle against pests and for personal safety. Pesticides break down before the food they protect reaches consumers, but exposure to them in large quanti - ties can hurt farmers who don't take proper precautions. So when pest-re- sistant GMO corn became available in South Africa in 2005, I wanted to try it. A nonprofit group, AfricaBio, gave me guidance. I learned, for instance, that 20 percent of our seeds were non-GMO, so that our fields would fight pests but also provide a refuge, pre - venting them from developing a re - sistance to GMO corn. This approach contributes to the environmental sus - tainability of GMOs. Our goal, after all, is not to drive a species into extinc - tion, but merely to protect our plants from their attackers. Ultimately, we seek a kind of peaceful coexistence. During that first season, I started to see the results soon. My plants were bigger, stronger and healthier. Dur - ing harvest, the yields increased by 34 percent. At that moment, I understood that biotechnology would be an essen - tial part of Africa's farming future. We grow more, spray less and look forward to a future full of biotechnology.SEEDING SUCCESS A generation ago, much of Africa missed out on the Green Revolution, which brought modern agricultural practices to the developing world. Today, Africa must become a full par - ticipant in the Gene Revolution. Our governments must let us enjoy access to the biotechnology tools that fuel incredible agricultural production in the United States and so much of the western hemisphere. Why should we lack what those farmers have? South Africa was an early adopter of GMOs, and for that I'm grateful. Too many other African countries have resisted biotechnology. They've responded to the misplaced worries of Europeans, who have largely refused to accept GMO foods. In my opinion, GMOs are perfectly healthy for hu - man consumption. I've been eating them for years, from what I grow on my own farm! The good news is that seven Af - rican countries\u2014Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda\u2014appear ready to join South Africa in commercializing GMOs, according to the latest report of the International Service for the Acqui - sition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA). On my farm, I've hosted visitors from these countries and else - where. They want to see how GMO crops succeed, and I like to think that I've done my small part to inform and educate people who want to improve their own food security. THE GIFT OF GIVING Many of the anti-GMO activists come from wealthy countries, where food security is taken for granted. I suspect that most of them never miss a meal. They remind me of the protestors I had to be optimistic to drive a tractor through a minefield, as I did in the aftermath of South African apartheid.GROWING OPTIMISM GM crops could be the key to Africa's food security BY MOTLATSI MUSI C_report.indd 22 5/30/14 10:42 AMFOR WHAT IT'S WORTH 23from an earlier time, who complained about advances in conventional farm - ing during the Green Revolution. Sometimes I wonder if they're not against GMOs as much as they're against every kind of new technol - ogy that farmers find helpful. I'd like to invite them to tour African farms, and see the hardship. Maybe that will change their hearts and minds. GMOs changed my life for the better. I'm not just a subsistence farmer, as are so many of my fellow Africans, but rather a farmer who makes a profit. One of my sons went to college, where he earned a bio - medical degree, and my profits paid his school fees. People are always talking about sustainable agricul - ture, and I'm a believer in this move - ment\u2014especially if the definition of \"sustainability\" includes economic sustainability, and an appreciation for farmers who aspire to do more than merely feed their own kids. When I started working on farms as a young man, the thought of giv - ing away food never occurred to me. Today, however, I'm able to donate a portion of my crops to local charities, including a childcare center, an old-age home and a hospice. So agricul-tural biotechnology sustains me, my family and my neighbors\u2014as well as consumers whom I'll never meet. We need more GMOs, not less. We need new traits that help us sur - vive droughts and adapt to climate change. We need seeds fortified with vitamin A, so that our children can get the nutrition that they need. Right now, we're on the threshold of remarkable progress, all because we've learned how to make the most of our crops. Let's continue to do all that we can to grow as much as possible.

C_report.indd 23 5/30/14 10:43 AMAcancer diagnosis would shake anyone to the core. For most of us, the word itself is synonymous with doom. \"There are many diseases that have awful progno - ses,\" says Murray Krahn, director of the Toronto Health Economics and Tech - nology Assessment Collaborative, \"but people fear breast cancer much more than they fear heart failure, even though heart failure carries a worse progno - sis.\" Why is this so? Perhaps because for generations we have viewed cancer as an irrevocable death sentence, with little chance of survival, much less of recovery. But for many of today's cancer patients, that is no longer the case. Innovations born of necessity have enabled us to treat and, in some cases, cure the disease. Nevertheless, cancer continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide, and its global burden is unmistak - ably rising. Close to 22 million new cases are expected to be diagnosed annually by 2030, according to the World Cancer Report 2014, published by the World Health Or - ganization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This figure represents an increase of nearly 90 per - cent over the estimated 14.1 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2012. In that year, lung, colorectum, pros - tate, stomach and liver were the five most commonly diag - nosed sites among men, while breast, colorectum, cervix, lung and the uterus were the most commonly diagnosed sites among women. \"Predominantly, this [increase] has been driven by the growth and aging of populations,\" says Christopher Wild, director of the IARC and an editor of the report. \"Cancer is a disease of aging. As people are liv - ing longer and not dying of infectious diseases, the cancer numbers are going up.\"Wild was particularly surprised by the prevalence of breast cancer among women from countries with a wide range of incomes. \"One in five of all people living, world - wide, within five years of a cancer diagnosis are breast can - cer survivors,\" he relates. All of the news, however, is not bad. Paolo Vineis, chair of Environmental Epidemiology at Imperial College Lon - don, highlights some of the achievements made in the war on cancer. In most high-income countries, \"mortality is going down, largely due to the fact that the frequency of smoking has decreased in men, so many tobacco-related cancers have been prevented.\" Vineis notes that this de - creased mortality is accompanied by an increased inci - dence, reflecting the effectiveness of new therapies and techniques that enable earlier diagnosis. The growing ar - senal of targeted cancer treatments promises even better outcomes ahead. UNDERLYING CAUSES Infection-related cancers still constitute up to 16 percent of the disease worldwide, with a higher proportion in low-in - come countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the figure is 33 percent. Helicobacter pylori , Hepatitis B or C, and human papillomavirus infections are causally as - sociated with the development of cancer. Although some infections can be difficult to avoid, much of the increase in the global cancer burden is expect - ed to come from lifestyle-associated cancers in low- and middle-income countries. The use of tobacco, consump - tion of alcohol and highly processed foods, obesity and lack of physical activity are all risk factors, and are all on the rise in many populations. Max Parkin, an epidemiolo - gist at the University of Oxford, found that known lifestyle The Scariest Word As cancer rates around the world increase, so must our efforts to combat this dreaded disease BY MEGAN CULLY24 illustrations by VERONICA LAWLOR D_cancer.indd other environmental factors accounted for 40-45 per - cent of all cancers in the UK in 2010.1 In light of these and other findings, both Vineis and Wild stress that preven - tion is key to decreasing the number of people diagnosed with cancer each year. \"We cannot hope to treat our way out of the cancer problem,\" says Wild. Some of the most important insights into the molecu - lar basis of cancer have come from families and groups of people with genetic predispositions to the disease. Numerous genome-wide association studies have sought to identify additional genetic loci that contribute to tu - morigenesis. According to Kari Hemminki, a professor at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, over 300 low-risk loci have been identified in this manner, but \"there is a lot of uncertainty about their cumulative risk.\" Studies to look for genes that confer susceptibility to par - ticular environmental agents have also been \"largely dis - appointing,\" he says. \"One can more or less predict the risks by looking at the environmental and genetic effects [independently].\" Many gaps remain in our epidemiological understand - ing of cancer. \"There are some cancers for which we still have almost no clue about the major causes of the disease, including prostate, pancreas, brain and kidney,\" says Wild. Environmental and lifestyle factors and single-gene muta - tions might contribute little to overall risk in these cancers, or we simply might not have found the specific culprits. WHAT'S IT WORTH? Given the number of individuals who are diagnosed with cancer each year, it is no surprise that the pharmaceutical industry has invested a substantial portion of its time and money in developing drugs to treat and cure the illness. Unfortunately, \"so many of these [currently used] drugs fail to really provide durable survival,\" says Christian Rommel, vice president of oncology research at Amgen, in Thousand Oaks, California. But Rommel is optimistic about the possibilities offered by two new approaches in drug development: therapies directed against specific tar - gets known to be altered in cancerous cells, and immuno - therapies, which re-activate the immune system to attack the tumor. Combining drugs from these two classes could provide the kind of durable survival he seeks to achieve. In general, spending money to treat cancer means that more people survive it, at least within a given period af - ter diagnosis. In a much-cited paper, Kevin Murphy and Robert Topel of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business concluded that a 1 percent decrease in mor - tality from cancer would be worth about $500 billion to the US economy. 2 As the United States invested about $50 billion in medical research in total, of which 40 percent was publicly funded, they argued that investing in medical research was, indeed, worth it. With cancer incidence on the rise, new therapies will be essential to curbing its effects. \"The reason we treat ill - ness is not to save money; we treat illness because we want to improve health,\" says Krahn. He argues that although cost is important, new treatments should be judged first and foremost on their therapeutic potential. Rommel agrees: \"Every meaningful therapy that provides durable overall survival\u2014or at some point, let's hope, cure\u2014will justify the investment.\" Already, advanced treatments are making cancer a less scary word. 1.

Political CANCER 25 D_cancer.indd 25 5/30/14 11:11 AM Throughout our lives, the marrow in our bones replenishes the blood cells that are essential to our sur - vival. But that process goes deadly wrong in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This devastating illness, which generates faulty blood cells and plate - lets, is one of the most lethal cancers, and so far, has continued to evade most medical attacks. Despite the mil - lions of dollars spent on research over the past 30 years, patients still receive the same two-drug chemotherapy cocktail. Even worse, the five-year sur - vival rate has remained at dismal lev - els\u2014about 20%\u2014over this period. While advances in treating AML stagnated, other cancer therapies changed dramatically. In 2001, for example, the introduction of tyro - sine-kinase inhibitors, like Gleevec (imatinib), provided new hope for pa - tients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Following that targeted technique, re - searchers now seek other compounds that zero in on specific cancer-causing molecules. At the same time, some voluntary health agencies, including The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), have shifted how they allocate their research dollars. In combina - tion, these two fundamental changes will redirect our approach to finding novel therapies for AML. Historically, nonprofit health or - ganizations like LLS followed a re - search-funding model similar to that used by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). We advertised the availability of research funding in one or more disease-focused areas, accept - ed investigator-initiated proposals, as - sembled peer-review panels composed of experts drawn from academia, and, after review, funded high-quality re - search based on scientific merit. Without doubt, this approach has delivered valuable outcomes. We have supported both incremental and, at times, breakthrough science. We fos - tered careers of brilliant academic re - searchers who have contributed life-saving scientific discoveries. Nonetheless, cancers such as AML continue to take lives and inflict im-measurable suffering. New therapies and cures are what patients desper - ately need and want. And so we asked ourselves: How can we accelerate the discovery of new therapies?EMBRACING the PROCESS26 BY LOUIS J. DEGENNARO A new breed of nonprofit brings key parties together to accelerate research D_cancer.indd 26 5/30/14 11:15 AM CALCULATING CANCER 27 BEYOND FUNDING The answer was to embrace and enable the process of drug discovery, from be - ginning to end. We developed our own ambitions and a proactive research agenda, identifying areas of high un - met medical need, including AML. To increase the likelihood that new discoveries will reach patients quickly, we adopted a venture philanthropy model. That is, LLS grew more deeply engaged in partnerships with bio - technology and pharmaceutical com-panies, and in managing promising product development projects to help surmount the investment-risk thresh - old. We also embarked on academic research partnerships with a more milestone-driven strategy, with de - liverables that had to be met at each stage of the project to qualify for con - tinued funding. As we rebooted our approach to funding research, the cancer re - search world itself has been evolving, thanks to new technologies and a greater understanding of the molec - ular underpinnings that cause can - cer. In cancer research in particular, the advent of genome sequencing provides an unprecedented opportu - nity to deliver patient-specific preci - sion therapies\u2014the right therapy, at the right time, to the right patient. So how do we apply these advances to our focus on AML? WE'VE GOT THE BEAT Recognizing the complexity of the AML challenge, LLS forged a sophis - ticated alliance of academic and cor - porate experts. Acting as the catalyst for collaboration, LLS joined forces with Brian Druker, director of the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University, and a coalition of institutions and experts poised to make precision medicine a new reality for AML patients. We call this project \"Beat AML.\" The Beat AML initiative inte - grates results from large-scale DNA sequencing and functional genomic tests done with AML patient samples. The team has already discovered rare and recurrent genetic mutations and learned how to identify which mu - tations are at the root of individual AML cases. Beat AML goes further by collaborating with pharmaceuti - cal and biotechnology companies to identify drugs that specifically target these abnormalities and deliver the appropriate combination of therapies to each patient to help him or her have the best possible outcome. Unravel - ing the biological complexity of AML is also likely to provide insights into molecular abnormalities that drive other types of cancer. As an organization dedicated to finding cures and ensuring ac - cess to treatments for all patients, we will continue our multi-pronged approach to advancing research. Diseases for which we understand the root cause are more amenable to drug-development funding; and diseases for which causes are not yet fully understood will still require greater funding for basic research. We aim to strike the proper funding balance with the appropriate mix of investigator-initiated grant programs and LLS-managed product develop - ment programs. We must also focus on the regulatory process, because as more innovative approaches to treating patients emerge, traditional models for advancing these therapies through the approval process must adapt and become more nimble. The new breed of health-focused nonprofits creates an aggressive scien - tific agenda because we are accountable \u2014now more than ever\u2014to patients. TOMORROW'S MODEL TODAY Delivering innovative approaches to treating cancer patients requires a sus - tained effort on the part of all stake - holders, and also requires sustained financial investment. Approximately 40 percent of new cancer therapies approved by the US Food and Drug Ad - ministration since 2000 were originally for a blood cancer. Many of these drugs have gone on to be used to treat other cancers and non-malignant diseas - es, including rheumatoid arthritis. Clearly, blood cancer research leads the way in advancing therapies that are benefiting patients with a wide ar - ray of diseases, and is therefore a wise investment. We hope the public will continue to support our endeavours through its donations. The breadth of the Beat AML proj - ect, the combination of technologies employed and the range of partners involved\u2014a leading nonprofit advo - cacy organization, research institu - tions, pharmaceutical and biotechnol - ogy companies\u2014mark it as one of the most comprehensive and innovative approaches to tackling a serious un - met medical need. We envision this collaboration as a model with wide application in the pursuit of new treat - ments for cancer and other diseases. Every four minutes, someone in the United States is diagnosed with a blood cancer, and every 10 minutes, a blood cancer patient dies. Together, academia, industry and nonprofits must pursue cures with a sense of ur - gency. Patients simply cannot wait. Louis J. DeGennaro is interim president and chief executive officer, as well as chief mis-sion officer at The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.As we rebooted our approach to funding research, the cancer research world itself has been evolving, thanks to new technologies and a greater understanding of the molecular underpinnings that cause cancer. D_cancer.indd 27 5/30/14 11:15 AMAmerican medicine is in desperate need of transformation, regard-less of the vested interests that may challenge its reform. Lives, health, resources and our morality are at stake. One of us\u2014Kauffman, an MD biologist\u2014watched his wife, Elizabeth Kauffman, fall through the cracks that splay, known but unseen, across our wid - er medical practices. Elizabeth had pancreatic adenocar - cinoma, a terrible cancer, and was not likely to live longer than the year that she did survive with such courage, grace and generosity. We, the authors of this article, came to - gether in part through our efforts to help Elizabeth. We started meeting in October 2012, when she was in treat - ment at the University of Washington Medical Center. There were two drivers of our early conversations. First, we discussed how Elizabeth fell through the cracks in Western medicine, between oncology's \"best practices\" protocol and its slightly off-center \"alternative\" counter - part, which includes experimental approaches. Physi - cians with off-mainstream perspectives often are viewed with contempt by established medicine and are routinely hounded by their local and state medical boards. Dis - missed by the establishment as deviating from best prac - tices, their work lies in a therapeutic grey zone, widely Transforming Medicine: A MANIFESTO Integrating \"best practices\" with \"alternative\" methods to determine which therapies benefit patients the most 28 BY STUART KAUFFMAN, COLIN HILL, LEROY HOOD & SUI HUANG D_cancer.indd 28 5/30/14 11:22 AM CALCULATING CANCER 29 referred to as alternative medicine. This grey area is en - tirely within the perimeter of rational science, yet is not embraced by best-practice medicine. It exists because best-practice medicine is a subset and not the absolute equiva - lent of good, useful, rational medicine. The effective com - ponents of alternative medicine need to be united, in new and integrative ways, with best-practice medicine, whose central pillar is evidence-based medicine. MANEUVERING THROUGH MOUNTAINS That brings us to the second driver of our conversations, now more academic, which is the limitations of the random - ized clinical trial (RCT), our field's gold standard, which provides, well, the evidence for evidence-based medicine. In a study in 2012, Maggie Eppstein, of the University of Vermont, Stuart Kauffman and their collaborators used a carefully designed mathemati - cal model and computational simulations to compare RCTs to an alternative approach called team learning. This approach generates new treatment combi - nations based on current success data and opinions of those hos - pitals with the best result, about which of the 100 treatment fac - tors to alter at each point in time. 1 In particular, they com - pared the methods for establishing the optimal treatment protocol, which consists of 100 features\u2014practices, types of interventions and so on\u2014and typically varies from in - stitution to institution. Team learning is now organized into qualitative improvement collaboratives (QIC), com - posed of groups of several care providers who exchange accounts of their experiences and discuss how to optimize the treatment protocol without the blinded pooling of all the data into a large, multi-center study. The results from the study Eppstein and her colleagues conducted depended on the complexity of the procedure. Engineers and biologists often liken an optimization pro - cess to walking on a landscape, where every position rep - resents, in our case, a particular therapeutic combination of procedures, and the elevation at that position reflects the success rate of the procedure. Optimization involves finding the highest peak. Depending on the complexity of the problem, the landscape topography can vary. If the problem is simple, the individual features of the procedure do not interact with each other but act independently, as \"mono-causal\" factors that contribute to the good out - come; then the landscape has a single peak, like Mount Fuji. Here optimization is simple: Move in the direction of steepest incline. In more complex tasks, the features of the treatment depend on each other, and mathematically this results in a landscape that is rugged, with multiple peaks separated by plateaus and val - leys\u2014more akin to the Rocky Mountains. Here, simply mov - ing in the direction where the terrain goes uphill will not bring the walker to the highest peak, and there is no guidance of di - rection in flat regions between the peaks. One can easily get stuck on the top of a small hill, far from the highest peak. In their simulations of the Mount Fuji-like scenario, Eppstein and her colleagues found that the RCT per - formed better, especially when a larger number of patients were involved. But intriguingly, it beat QIC only by a small margin. With a smaller number of patients and a Rocky Mountain-like landscape\u2014indicating multi-causality\u2014QIC outperformed RCT. As multi-causality increased, RCTs failed even more dramatically. Thus, team learning, The effective components of alternative medicine need to be united, in new and integrative ways, with best-practice medicine, whose central pillar is evidence- based medicine. D_cancer.indd 29 5/30/14 11:23 AM30 which may cost less than RCTs and uses nearly anecdotal data, can lead us to better care protocols in complex en - vironments, especially where the RCT's evidence-based, brute-force statistics become inappropriate. So we need better methods with multi-causal statistics. TESTING NEW TECHNIQUES Do we think that biology and medicine involve multi-factorial causality? The answer is almost always yes. These results suggest that RCTs throw away some or even vast amounts of clinically relevant data. No one knows how much. We randomize a study, divide the patients in control and treatment groups in a blinded fashion to eliminate confounding factors, which we suspect but cannot pin - point. For instance, if we know that gender might affect the outcome, we make sure that both groups will have the same number of male and female patients. Such controlled stratification cannot be applied to the thousands of pos - sible factors that influence the outcome when we do not know what those factors are. Consequently, randomization neglects the vast space of information about causal factors that likely differ between individuals and might interact with each other, thereby leading to a multi-casual effect on the outcome, such that randomization might not average away these causative effects. Moreover, randomized trials produce results that apply to a phantom \"average\" person, whom a given individual is unlikely to resemble with re - spect to every possible characteristic that might impact the disease or response to treatment. It gets even worse. Only drugs that pass phase-III RCT trials, in which efficacy is demonstrated in a larger number of patients, can be FDA approved. Only such drugs can become part of the hospital best-practice formulary. Once on the formulary, the hospital faces sanctions, even loss of accreditation, for failing to follow best practice as hal - lowed by RCTs. But best-practice doctors\u2014typically high - ly trained, of high integrity and good intent, aiming to be \"scientific\" and not let in charlatans\u2014are confined to best- Pathways to Improvement 1. Explore real clinical-fitness landscapes, empirically treated with combinations of candidate therapies, to see how often the landscapes are multi-peaked. 2. Search other fields for alternative ways to empirically search clinical-fitness landscapes. 3. Use various search engines and data from empirical clinical-fitness landscapes to build ensembles of putative single- and multi-causal models of disease processes that can be tested in simulations.4. If true mechanisms of causality cannot be determined, we must study how to optimally treat patients in the absence of detailed knowledge. For example, can we better treat with single drugs for single targets or with combinations of drugs aimed at many points in complex regulatory networks? 5. Urge the US Food and Drug Admin- istration to preserve its accumulated wisdom but very carefully widen its scope beyond RCTs. 6. Consider foregoing phase III trials and moving to phase IV trials, where defined patient populations, perhaps identified by the N=1 experiment defined above\u2014with coordinating supervision\u2014begin to generalize team learning and test treatments with multi-factorial causality. This empowers all of us to be part of a global medical learning system. 7. Build very high-dimensional \"state spaces\" of thousands of pieces of environmental, genetic, epigenetic and physiological data\u2014so-called big data\u2014and follow hundreds or thou-sands of patients to define \"health\" and \"diseased\" areas in these huge state spaces to move toward person-alized medicine. 8. Begin a slow careful integration of in-the-box, near-the-box and alterna-tive medicine to broaden our informa-tion and exploration bases.To reveal more options in our search for advanced treatments of disease, we recommend the following changes: D_cancer.indd 30 5/30/14 11:24 AM CALCULATING CANCER 31 The technology is here, and the knowledge of how the human system functions is improving rapidly, such that the collected data cloud around each individual patient can serve as the basis of informed decisions.practice medicine both by professional ethics and because they will most likely not be insured should they stray. Fur - thermore, in the name of best-practice medicine based on a now outdated reliance on RCTs, off-center, skilled doc-tors are harassed, pay exorbitant legal fees defending their rights to practice and carefully explore outside the box, or may even lose their licenses. The healthcare establishment scoffs at their off-center ideas. In the nether-regions near the inferno of pure charla - tanism lies alternative medicine, often founded on merely anecdotal accounts\u2014not unlike the team learning above\u2014and held in contempt. What can we do? Alternative medicine lacks the reassuring endorse - ment that the label \"evidence-based\" confers, and hence, is abhorred by main - stream medicine. But it is as rational and rigorous as any mainstream philosophy that relies on the scientific method. \"Evidence\" may be overstated; the evidence in evidence-based medicine is obtained through randomization and averaging over heterogeneous populations, just to neutral - ize our ignorance, and thus is almost guaranteed to not fully apply to a specific per - son. Evidence-based medicine would work if we were all clones of each other. Evidence-based procedures will work in a given patient to the limited extent of how much her thousands of relevant characteristics match those of the theoretical \"mean\" patient. But how much does she depart from that average? 'OMICS OPTIONS We are entering an era in which we can measure those fac - tors that RCTs have considered dark matter in the infor - mation space of patient-specific traits and have random - ized away. We can determine the multi-causality network of each individual patient. The arrival of the 'omics tech - nologies\u2014genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, pro - teomes and metabolomes\u2014is about to shine light into this dark matter of patient-specific causality. This offers an op - portunity to unite the \"unscientific,\" but patient-focused alternative medicine with the \"scientific,\" evidenced-based best practices, or one-size-fits-all medicine. The fact is that the thousands of patients who participate in clinical trials differ from one another both genomically and environ - mentally, and the assumption that they are equivalent is patently false. For each patient, the 'omic analyses generate a virtual data cloud of billions of data points. These can be used to analyze the individual patients, and those who share interesting features, like response to a given drug, can then be aggregated into groups that will respond uni -formly. In a sense, N=1 experiments\u2014those that include only one person\u2014are performed, and the patients with shared features are aggregated. Personalized medicine strives to exploit precisely the information that is randomized away in RCTs by study - ing one thousand patients or more. Instead of the false certainty obtained by neutralizing patient-specific varia - tion in studies that include as many people as possible, personalized medicine seeks, ideally, a full molecular profiling of an individual patient. The technology is here, and the knowledge of how the human system functions is improving rapidly, such that the collected data cloud around each individual patient can serve as the basis of informed decisions. Thus, the dimensionality of measure - ments, which captures the multi-causality revealed by team learn - ing and the conscious abnegating of randomization, warrants the personalized approach. The pre - requisites for this approach are high-dimensional measurements that leave no or little unaccount - ed-for factors that would have to be randomized, and mechanistic knowledge that allows predictive models based on the high-dimen - sional data obtained for each individual. In November 2012, as Elizabeth was getting worse, a careful study at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Flor - ida, demonstrated that in some solid tumors, the cells in the acidic areas grew faster than those in the more alkaline areas. There is a known biochemical basis for this prefer - ence of tumor cells for lower pH and, thus, for a mecha-nistic rationale for alkalization as a way to curb tumor growth. Treatment with mere sodium bicarbonate slowed the growth in the acidic areas in animal experiments. But not all tumors are equally sensitive to alkalinization. If we had measured Elizabeth's tumor-cell metabolome, an analysis soon to be available in the clinic, this could have revealed whether her tumor could be suppressed by controlled alkalinization. When told of these preclinical data, the in-the-box oncologist dismissed alkalinization therapy for lack of RCT evidence. Elizabeth received intravenous cesium chloride, a powerful alkanizing agent, under another doctor's care, and it may well have extended her life several months. We will never know. The N=1 ex - periment was never permitted.

PLoS BY CHAD FLAIG A TEAM ATTACK As I stand in front of my bathroom mirror, I look at myself\u2014face to re - flection\u2014and say, \"Okay, you're going to have to deal with this.\" At the same time, I know that this is a lot to handle. That was 2009, and at the age of 49, I'd just been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's indolent follicular lympho - ma. Although my oncologist, Philip Leming, called this a slow-growing cancer, he said that I needed to start treatment right away, because my PET scan \"lit up like a Christmas tree.\" He added that there was no cure. Quickly, I learned that I didn't have to handle this alone. My wife, Jenny, stood beside me each step of the way. It was us against cancer. MORE THAN ACHY This all started with a few aches in my hips and legs. When an orthope - dist examined my MRI, he suspected cancer. That same day, Dr. Lem - ing confirmed the bad news, but he claimed that there wasn't a lymphoma that he couldn't treat. That gave me a sense of confidence that never left me throughout my illness.Faced with incurable lymphoma, I was never alone, as a circle of family, friends and physicians rallied for my recovery I soon needed that confident at - titude. My therapy began with eight chemotherapy treatments that in - cluded Rituximab. The next 24 weeks of my life went in three-week cycles. The first week after treatment, I would be wired from Prednisone, which is a steroid that is often part of a cancer treatment. The second week my en - ergy level would be down, and by the third week, I would start to feel nor - mal. Then, I started the cycle all over. D_cancer.indd 32 5/30/14 11:30 AMAs a teacher at Shroder High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, I hoped to work the treatments around my schedule. Luckily, I only took three treatments during the school year. The rest came during my summer break with a few maintenance treat - ments in the fall. By the fall I was in remission, but not for long. TOO SOON In December, a PET scan revealed that the cancer had returned. Dr. Leming recommended a stem-cell transplant at The University of Nebraska Medi - cal Center (UNMC) in Omaha. In January 2010, Jenny and I trav - eled to Omaha and consulted with another oncologist, Julie Vosse. After several tests, she determined that I would be a good candidate for a trans - plant. After several treatments to pre - pare me for the procedure, another PET scan revealed cancer in my pelvic region, where I had the original pain. So I completed a course of radiation before the transplant. Then, a urinary tract infection turned septic. That in - cident, along with some other minor issues, postponed my transplant for almost a month. Like all transplant patients and their caregivers at UNMC, Jenny and I stayed at the Lied Transplant Cen - ter inside the hospital. Each room is a mini suite\u2014very conducive to patient comfort. Instead of being confined to a small lonely hospital room with nurses taking vitals, patients have a more comfortable room where they can be cared for by a trained family member. In addition, a team of phy - sicians, nurses and social workers helped us with everything in and out - side of medical care. Every Thursday the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society sponsored a luncheon for transplant patients and their caregivers. Through the luncheons, we became close with five patients and their caregivers. The support and encouragement that we gave to one another was priceless and still continues for the three survivors. BEST OF BROTHERLY LOVE To have a transplant, I needed a source of stem cells. Fortunately, my brother was a match. Having a sibling match reduces the chance for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and can decrease recovery time. In contrast to much of my journey, my transplant was anticlimactic. At UNMC, patients and doctors refer to the days after the transplant as \"+ days.\" The day after the trans - plant is +1, a week later is +8 and so on. These + days served as mile mark - ers. Usually, you go home on day +100, depending on your condition. We were told that the record for let - ting someone go home was +80. We wanted to beat that number. The days in Omaha dragged. I dealt with severe diarrhea, nausea, low-grade fevers, minor GVHD, loss of appetite and difficulties staying hy - drated. While it was often a strain, I was told by a number of people that I was doing better than most. Finally on day +82, I started some exit testing! On day +91, we had our final appointment with Dr. Vosse, but it was not as perfect as I had hoped. A mass on my neck vertebrae still required radiation. I argued that my brother's stem cells would fight the cancer, but Dr. Vosse looked directly at me and said that she believed the cancer would grow if not radiated. How could I argue? OTHER OBSTACLES Our return home was as joyful as any event in our lives. But then I endured four weeks of radiation, which was my worst treatment. I was extremely fatigued, lost my sense of taste and thus my appetite\u2014all during the holi - days! It took a year for my taste buds to return to normal. I hoped to get back to teaching in January 2011, but the radiation pre - vented that. Then, I aimed for March, right after spring break, but a bout of shingles\u2014causing incredible pain and permanently damaging my right eye\u2014blocked that option. Despite being eager to get back to teaching in the fall, my attitude began to plummet. As I was getting better from one ailment, I would get another. I was hospitalized a few times for respiratory infections, and I was getting very tired of being sick. Dr. Leming compared my condition to that of soldiers who experience battle fatigue. As August approached, I was not sure if I would be able to return to school that fall. Suddenly, almost mi - raculously, I began to feel better and gained strength without any setbacks. I don't think I ever enjoyed the start of school as much as I did that year. Today, nearly four years after my transplant, I am cancer-free and feel - ing good. Like my strong team helped me, I want to help others handle their cancer battles and find the strength to fight.

CALCULATING CANCER 33 D_cancer.indd 33 5/30/14 11:30 AMWith new metrics and an ever-growing pool of data, this year's Scorecard offers a more balanced assessment of biotech innovation around the world /T_h e father of relativity, Albert Ein- stein, once said, \"Life is like riding a bicycle, in order to keep your bal-ance, you must keep moving.\" Ev-ery bike rider knows exactly what Einstein meant. /T_h e same might be said of the Scienti/f_i c American Worldview Scorecard: to keep our momentum, and the accompany-ing balance, we must keep mov- ing. /T_h is Scorecard marks our sixth year of measuring global biotechnology innovation. In our ongoing e orts to objectively document bioscience activity worldwide, we continue to /f_i nd new ways to /f_i ne-tune our methodology. As the following pages attest, moving ahead for us means collecting more data from the most up-to-date sources we can /f_i nd. In addition, those data must cover a wide range of countries, meet our requirements for objectivity, and include information on a multiplicity of relevant subjects\u2014from upstream R&D funding and edu-cation to later stage commercialization and partnership development. We believe that it's this broad combination of data that truly reveals a nation's total strength in biotech capabilities and potential. When necessary, we expand the types of data used if we feel it creates a better overall picture of international biotech activity. /T_h is year, for example, a new data set has been added to our intellectual property (IP) metric. /T_h is not only updates the IP section, but it also o ers a new di-mension to our analysis that bolsters the category's value.Furthermore, the 2014 Scorecard introduces a com- pletely new category: Productivity. Many of the compo-nents that make up the Scorecard categories track inputs\u2014those factors that fuel bioscience endeavors, such as the variety of /f_i nancial investments\u2014while the Productivity category expands our measurement of outputs , such as the revenue generated by public companies. /T_h e continuing growth and re/f_i nement of the Score- card metrics not only provide deeper coverage of the glob-al biotech landscape, but they also enhance the value of the results. As expected, the impact of these changes in our analysis is felt in the overall order of the rankings. Since biotechnology a ects so much of the world in so many ways, however, we always make a point to look beyond the Scorecard rankings themselves. /T_h is year, we investigate intriguing developments in public markets, ag-ricultural biotechnology, international investing appetites and R&D expenditures. Delving deeper into the history of the Scorecard, this year we examine Scandinavia's unwavering success in the industry. In addition, we analyze the correlation between the Scorecard's output and related metrics, where the re-sults surprised even us. /T_h e growing archive of Scienti/f_i c American Worldview Scorecards also presents us with enhanced opportunities to track longitudinal trends. Over the past two years, for example, we looked closely at the global economic climate in biotechnology to see if there were indications of recov-ery. /T_h is year's data give us a conclusive answer. Read on to see what we found! \u2014THE EDITORSEXPANDING THE EVIDENCE2014 WORLDVIEW SCORECARD E_Scorecard.indd 34 6/2/14 10:34 AMGLOBAL BIOTECHNOLOGY INNOVATION 35 Assessment Overview How the Scorecard computes the results in each category On May 3, 1883, Lord Kelvin, a 19th-century British sci- entist best known for precisely measuring absolute zero, discussed the subject of measurement at the Institute of Civil Engineers in London. He declared: I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsat-isfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of science, whatever the matter may be. So here we seek a science of innovation in biotechnology, and we do \"express it in numbers.\" To accomplish this, we rank each country's performance in seven categories: Productivity, Intellectual Property Pro-tection, Intensity, Enterprise Support, Education/Workforce, Foundations, and Policy and Stability. The category scores arise from a series of components (explained below), and the mean score from the associated components produces the category score in each case. We normalize the results on a scale from 0 to 10. The lowest-ranked country we scored as 0 and the highest-ranked country as 10. The 54 nations on the Scorecard represent a wide range of sizes\u2014in both area and population. To ensure that impor-tant contributions from smaller countries are not ignored solely because of their size, many of the components include relative features, such as using \"public company employees per capita\" rather than just the gross number of employees. In some cases, though, the Scorecard relies on the gross measurement, such as the available venture capital, where the absolute amount\u2014in our opinion\u2014is the more important measure of a country's ability to innovate in biotechnology. As we will explain later, each category gets equal weight in the overall score.

In short, fewer innovators would take the risk of time and investment without some hope of capturing a return. The value of IP Protection has vast implications. For instance, a rm might abandon a drug lead if it cannot nd pro t-enabling markets for it. In prior issues of Scienti c American World-view, we showed that the strength of a country's IP Protection correlates with its concentration of clinical trials. Ac-cordingly, IP Protection supplies more than a simple invitation for global rms to sell patented drugs in a country\u2014it can also impact whether that nation's scientists and physicians will play a role in global drug development, and intellectual Property Protection Expanded IP data /f_l esh out 0.040.010.08 8:18 AMAUSTRALIA AUSTRIA BELGIUM CANADA CHINA DENMARK FINLAND FRANCE GERMANY HONG KONG INDIA IRELAND ISRAEL JAPANITALY NETHERLANDS NORWAY POLAND UNITED KINGDOMUNITED STATESSWITZERLAND TAIWANSWEDENGross productivity might instantly come to mind when thinking about measuring a country's strength in biotechnology. This year, we have begun including this metric in the Scorecard, but thus far we only have data on about half the countries in our analysis. We assess productivity using two metrics: \"public company revenues\" and the \"number of public B. Nat. Biotech-nol. 31, 697-703 (2013), and com-pany disclosures). The rationale for focusing on public companies is that the reporting requirements of public companies and the resulting transpar-ency, relative to private rms, makes it easier to objectively compare them. In addition, the challenge of develop-ing and locating public companies in a nation indicates how favorable a biotechnology climate it provides. Not surprisingly, the United States runs away with this category. In second place, Australia also manages to dis-tance itself from the rest of the pack.WORLDVIEW SCORECARD 37 Productivity Making a move to measure the will be developed for locally endemic conditions. Historically, we have used a single metric called IP Strength (Park, W.G. Research Policy 37, 761-766 (2008)), which consists of the unweighted sum of ve measurements: patentable inventions, membership in interna-tional treaties, duration of protection, enforcement mechanisms and restric-tions (e.g., compulsory licensing). Despite the age of this index, it remains the leading global index of IP strength. This year, we added a second component: \"perceived IP protection\" (Schwab, K. The Global Competi-tiveness Report, 2013-2014. World Economic Forum (2013)). Schwab produced this index by asking a global group of business leaders about their perceptions of domestic IP protection. Incorporating it here provides updated information and an element of subjec-tivity. After all, perceptions of patent protection might be as important as objective measures. The United States leads this category by a large margin, followed by Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada.0.24 00.5910 PUBLIC COMPANY REVENUES (US$MM) E_Scorecard.indd 37 0.13 AUSTRALIA 5.30 AUSTRIA 1.25 BELGIUM 2.70 BRAZIL 2.87 CANADA 2.65 CHILE 0.02 CHINA 0.94 CZECH REPUBLIC 0.02 DENMARK 7.59 FINLAND 0.69 FRANCE 2.14 GREECE 0.02 HONG KONG 1.65 GERMANY 1.08 HUNGARY 0.01 INDIA 1.08 INDONESIA 0.16 IRELAND 2.06 ISRAEL 3.20 JAPAN 0.93 MALAYSIA 0.03 ITALY 0.85 MEXICO 1.49 NETHERLANDS 2.11 NORWAY 1.96 PHILIPPINES 0.03 NEW ZEALAND 2.59 POLAND 2.11 PORTUGAL 0.06 QATAR 0.01 SAUDI ARABIA 0.05 RUSSIA 2.08 THAILAND 0.08 TURKEY 0.13 UKRAINE 0.03 UNITED KINGDOM 2.32 UNITED STATES 6.20 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES 0.07SOUTH AFRICA 1.41 SOUTH KOREA 1.84 SPAIN 4.15 SWITZERLAND 3.63 TAIWAN, CHINA 3.05 SWEDEN 3.05SINGAPORE 4.3838 In physics, intensity measures the power applied to a speci c area. We use the term in a similar way, as a measurement of a country's focus on biotechnology. This category is compiled from a series of relative measurements that normalize the data for population size and overall economy. Thus, our Intensity cat-egory enables readers to compare large countries to each other, and it identi es small countries with strong biotechnology activities. In short, Intensity represents a relative measurement of a country's activity in the industry. Rather than measur-ing an output, like a market activity, Intensity measures input. Conse-quently, countries with high scores in this category could make great places to perform biotech research or to look for partners. Several of the components of the Intensity metric rely on public biotech rm data that come from company disclosures and published information (Huggett, B. Nat. Biotechnol. 31, 697- 703 (2013), and company disclosures). For the \"public biotechnology company employees per capita\" component, we divided the employee counts by the 2013 mid-year population as sourced from the US Census Bureau Interna-tional Data Base. For \"public biotech-nology company revenues per GDP,\" we used the 2013 GDP as sourced from the IMF World Economic Outlook Database. The data for \"biotech patents per total patents\" ( led with the Pat-ent Cooperation Treaty) and \"business expenditures on biotechnology R&D\" came from the Organisation for Eco-nomic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \"Value added of knowledge- and technology-intensive industries\" was sourced from the NSF Science and Engineering Indicators for 2014. Last year Denmark, the United States, Australia and Ireland led in this category. The mix at the top re-mains about the same\u2014Denmark, the United States and Australia leading the way, but Singapore takes Ireland's place for the fourth spot. As an indicator of input, Intensity offers a perfect place for a country to push its way higher up the Scorecard. Between now and 2015, any nation could direct incentives to promote biotech job creation or invest more in biotechnology R&D. Besides improv-ing a country's placement on our metric, such added 'intensity' should heat up its biotech capabilities.

In large part, that means making sure that enough capital exists to fund innovation. Likewise, countries with the most appealing business environ-ments will attract the most biotech-nology companies. We measure these characteristics as Enterprise Support. The Enterprise Support met- ric consists of an average of four elements. We derived a \"business friendly environment\" measurement from Doing Business 2014 (World Bank and the International Finance Corpo-ration), which arose from surveys of local experts on a synthetic business case. This approach includes some limitations because it relies on a specific business of a specified size and refers to conducting business in a country's largest city, with the excep-tion of certain nations, such as China. The \"biotechnology venture capital\" component was created using mea-surements from the OECD. The \"ven-ture capital availability\" score comes from an index based on an interna-tional survey (Schwab, K. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2013-2014. World Economic Forum (2013)). We derived the last component, \"capital availability,\" from the Milken Institute Capital Access Index. Last year the United States, India and Israel displaced Hong Kong and Singapore to move, respectively, to first, second and third places. This year Hong Kong returns to first place, followed by the United States and Singapore. Not surprisingly, other afflu- ent nations earn high rankings in this category. For example, two Gulf nations\u2014Qatar and the United Arab Emirates\u2014come out in fifth and seventh, respectively. On the other hand, all of the BRICs nations finish far down the list, with India at 48th place and Brazil in 52nd. Russia did little better, occupying the 43rd spot, while China topped the BRICs, taking 31st place. E_Scorecard.indd 41 6/2/14 8:46 AM 42 Education/ Workforce People empower a nation's current and future innovation potential All the financial resources and advanced equipment in the world cannot replace a key ingredient of biotech success\u2014people. Without trained researchers to spawn innovative ideas, managers to run the business side of biotech, technicians to make the products and individuals filling many other roles\u2014a country cannot support biotechnology growth. To generate the necessary pool of people, a nation must take action. In 2004, for instance, the US Department of Labor created the National Center for the Biotechnology Workforce, and related aspects of this center continue to train tomorrow's biotechnology professionals. We base this category of the Scorecard on five components. For \"post-secondary science graduates per capita,\" we used UNESCO figures, divided by the 2013 mid-year popula-tion as sourced from the US Census Bureau International Database. For \"PhD graduates in the life sciences per capita\" and \"R&D personnel per thousand employment,\" we turned to OECD figures. To create a metric for \"talent retention,\" we calculated the percentage of a country's doc-toral recipients who did not express definite intentions to stay in the United States following graduation there, as reported by the US National Science Foundation. Thus, a lower score in talent retention means that more PhD graduates did express a desire to stay in the United States, which AUSTRALIA 5.18 AUSTRIA 3.48 BELGIUM 2.73 BRAZIL 2.03 CANADA 3.83 CHILE 1.48 ARGENTINA 2.69 CHINA 0.90 CZECH REPUBLIC 3.30 DENMARK 4.18 FINLAND 4.01 FRANCE 4.57 GREECE 1.98 HONG KONG 1.47 GERMANY 4.28 HUNGARY 1.81 ICELAND 4.97 INDONESIA 4.91 IRELAND 4.17 ISRAEL 1.76 JAPAN 3.81 LATVIA 2.82 ITALY 2.70ESTONIA 3.00 INDIA 0.15 LUXEMBOURG 9.86 MALAYSIA 3.02 LITHUANIA 3.43 MEXICO 1.53 NETHERLANDS 2.42 NORWAY 2.89 PHILIPPINES 0.87NEW ZEALAND 6.46 POLAND 3.00 PORTUGAL 2.98 SAUDI ARABIA 7.64 SINGAPORE 6.08 RUSSIA 3.60 PUERTO RICO 2.36 THAILAND 4.58 TURKEY 1.69 UKRAINE 0.33 UNITED KINGDOM 5.90 UNITED STATES 6.46 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES 1.99SOUTH AFRICA 0.73 SOUTH KOREA 3.84 SPAIN 3.05 SWITZERLAND 3.67 TAIWAN, CHINA SWEDEN 3.50SLOVAK REPUBLIC 43 creates \"brain drain\" for the home country of those graduates. Not every person who wants to stay in the United States after earning a PhD finds an opportunity to stay, however, so some of those individuals still go home or to another country. India and China have traditionally led in the number of citizens not wishing to repatriate after graduate studies in the United States, but this year Ukraine takes the lead\u2014perhaps a premonition of the country's difficult times, which came to a head as this issue of Scientific American Worldview was being published\u2014fol-lowed by India and China. Last year's leaders in the Educa- tion/Workforce category were Iceland, the United States and the United King-dom. Although these leaders retain strong numbers, they are displaced this year by Luxembourg, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand. Also, certain coun-tries that perform strongly in other categories really struggle here. For example, three of the Gulf countries on the Scorecard occupy three of the four bottom spots on the list, along with India.

Since our first issue in 2009, Finland has always landed in the Top Three. In fact, more often than not Finland takes the top spot in this category, with first place finishes in 2010, 2012, 2013 and again this year. That's four for six, an incredible showing, and it would be beyond belief if international biotechnology were professional baseball. Here, we rely on four components. Data from the OECD are the source of \"R&D business expenditures per GDP.\" UNESCO data are used for \"government support of R&D per GDP.\" For data on \"infrastructure quality,\" we turned to the World Economic Forum (Schwab, K. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2013-2014. World Economic Forum (2013)), which uses an international survey to produce its index. Last, we derived the component called \"innovation and entrepreneurship opportunity\" from the 2013 Legatum Prosperity Index. We include metrics on R&D spending in addition to fundamental metrics, such as infrastructure quality, because R&D can plant the seed for future growth. Many interesting opportunities present themselves in the course of research, so it is reasonable to expect that spending more on R&D will reveal more opportunities. In a country with a strong \"innovation and entrepreneur-ship opportunity\" score, researchers will be encouraged to spin off ventures to pursue these opportunities, laying the foundation of organic domestic growth. As already mentioned, Finland took last year's top spot in Foundations, and Switzerland and Sweden followed in second and third place, respectively. This year Sweden slips to fourth. Switzerland stays in second, sandwiched between Finland on top and third-place South Korea. Iceland experienced a significant drop from fifth in 2013 to 11th this year. As these fluctuations show, categories driven by financial factors are subject to significant volatility.

To assess the policy and stability of each country, we used the following mea-surements from the World Bank's 2013 World Governance Indicators: political stability and absence of violence/ter-rorism; government effectiveness; regulatory quality; and rule of law. These factors encompass features that make a nation a good or bad place to do business.Such measurements provide a broad overview of a country's political and social environment, including its government's stability and the quality of its public services. This category also measures a government's ability to create and put in place mechanisms that promote develop-ment in the private sector. The Policy and Stability category even reflects a nation's level of crime and violence. As such, this multi-faceted section complements the other Scorecard metrics. As noted, Scandinavia scores well here, with Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark placing first, third, sixth and ninth, respectively. Finding Singapore in second place comes as no surprise, given its political and economic E_Scorecard.indd 46 6/2/14 9:15 AMWORLDVIEW SCORECARD 47 10 8 6420ARGENTINA AUSTRALIA AUSTRIA BELGIUM BRAZIL CANADA CHILE CHINA CZECH REPUBLIC DENMARK ESTONIA FINLAND FRANCE GERMANY GREECE HONG KONG HUNGARY ICELAND INDIA INDONESIA IRELAND ISRAEL ITALY JAPAN KUWAIT LATVIA LITHUANIA LUXEMBOURG MALAYSIA MEXICO NETHERLANDS NEW ZEALAND NORWAY PHILIPPINES POLAND PORTUGAL PUERTO RICO QATAR RUSSIA SAUDI ARABIA SINGAPORE SLOVAK REPUBLIC SOUTH AFRICA SOUTH KOREA SPAIN SWEDEN SWITZERLAND TAIWAN, CHINA THAILAND TURKEY UKRAINE UAE UNITED KINGDOM UNITED STATES POLITICAL STABILITY & ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS REGULATORY QUALITY RULE OF LAWefforts to generate a commercially attractive environment for business. Many countries known for biotech expertise finish poor- ly here. For example, the United States performs rather dismally in this category\u2014landing in 19th place, just as it did in the 2013 Scorecard. In addition, some nations that attract considerable investment in biotechnology, including Brazil and China, end up far down this list. To some inves-tors, that could make these countries appealing, because they represent opportunities for change and improvement. E_Scorecard.indd 47 6/2/14 9:16 AM 48 2014 Scientific American Worldview Overall Scores PRODUCTIVITY GIVES THE US AN EXTRA PUSH The United States maintains its hold on the top spot in our overall scoring\u2014even strengthening its grasp this year by gaining a bigger lead over its competitors. On the 2013 Scorecard, the US outstripped its closest rival, Denmark, by 5 percent; this year, it surpassed second-place Singapore by almost 25 percent. But before digging deeper into these numbers, let's explore our methodology. The final results are arrived upon through a collection of averages and totals. As described previously, each coun-try gets a score in seven categories: Productivity, Intel-lectual Property Protection, Enterprise Support, Intensity, Education/Workforce, Foundations, and Policy and Stability. Moreover, each category is made up of a set of compo-nents. Based on 0-10 scores, for lowest to highest, we averaged the component scores to determine the category score. Last, the simple sum of the category averages\u2014in-dexed to a score from 0-50\u2014produces the overall innova-tion score. The normalization gives each component and each category an equal weight. Therefore, each component or category contributes to the overall score as much as any other. Where data cannot be found, we ignore the resulting gaps when calculating the averages for each category. The increase in the US lead results largely from the addition of the Productivity category. As we will show in the supporting elements of this section, many factors reflect a strong output role for the United States as a biotechnology powerhouse. Besides the US, a number of countries saw major upswings in their overall scores. For example, second-place Singapore rose from a fifth-place finish in 2013. Likewise, Australia jumped from seventh to fourth. In a major leap, Puerto Rico went from 52nd to 30th on its overall score, climbing 22 places up the Scorecard for the biggest gain of the year. Other impressive showings came from Qatar, jump-ing 17 spots from 42nd to 25th, and the UAE, which went up 13 places, from 40th to 27th. In addition, Estonia, Latvia and Saudi Arabia each advanced by a dozen spots. And several other countries\u2014including Luxembourg, Taiwan and Thai-land\u2014made substantial moves up the Scorecard. As some nations soar, others inevitably drop in the overall rankings. Hungary suffered the biggest fall, plum-meting 14 places, from 27th to 41st. It was not alone, though, because 29 other countries lost ground this year. The competition to lead the world in biotech innova- tion potential grows fiercer over time. Rather than inching up the Scorecard, some countries scale it like a mountain goat on a molehill\u2014seeming to navigate effortlessly to the top. But no nation climbs this Scorecard without effort. The broad range of components and categories demand inten-sive efforts and diverse investments of time, money and mental capital. Where will your country \"invest\" to improve its position?

Moreover, it is the only member of this year's group that also held the distinction last year. All of the other countries\u2014Indonesia, India, Ukraine and Argentina\u2014escaped the Bottom Five in 2013. As in the Top Five, Productivity does not make the difference. In fact, all of these countries perform poorly in that category, which could further drive down their scores in some other categories, thereby reducing their overall innovation ranking. In general, two categories\u2014Intensity and Educa-tion/Workforce\u2014suggest the source of the problem in the Philippines's biotech innovation potential. Among the other countries in the Bottom Five, the Philippines tied with the Ukraine for the lowest Intensity score of the bunch. Then, in Education/Workforce, the Philippines received the lowest score of any of the countries in this group. Interestingly, the Philippines earned the best IP Protection score of the bottom cohort, which suggests that biotech innovation could at least be safely developed there from a profit potential. This should offer hope to the country's biotech industry. All of the Bottom Five countries perform poorly in our Policy and Sta-bility category, and that's never good for business, at least not legitimate ones. Improvements here could go a long way toward developing a success-ful biotech industry in these nations.ONE TRIO STAYS ON TOP Production isn't the only indicator of success Returning to the Top Five this year, the United States, Denmark and Singapore jostle into their new positions. Den-mark dropped from second to third, while Singapore climbed from fifth to second. The newcomers to this year's Top Five are Australia and Sweden. This is a good place to stop and consider the role of Productivity in these rankings. One might expect a Productivity measurement to dominate the metrics and drive the positions on the Scorecard. It didn't. The Top Five finishers do not go in order of their Productivity scores. If they did, the descending order would be: the United States, Australia, Sweden, Denmark and Singapore. That configuration only gets one ranking right, for the United States. Once again, this shows the value of normalizing the Scorecard data, which prevents a single category from dictating the results. That said, the value of a country's Productivity should not be under-rated. Rather than being a category of achievement that exists in isola-tion, Productivity is one feature of our assessment that can deeply affect the others, and as such, should not be seen solely as an output. The interplay between aspects of biotechnology can easily turn suspected outputs into in-puts, and this is surely the case here. A country's outputs in biotechnology impact its inputs. For example, a na-tion that produces significant outputs should attract more biotech invest-ment, possibly more experts in the field and more, maybe much more, in-novation. Indeed, the next collection of data seems to support this very point, but through a counter-example.NDONESIA PHILIPPINESINDIAUKRAINEARGENTINAPRODUCTIVITY IP PROTECTION INTENSITY ENTERPRISE SUPPORT EDUCATION/WORKFORCE FOUNDATIONS POLICY & STABILITY UNITED STATES SINGAPORE DENMARK AUSTRALIA SWEDEN 9.7 8.9 8.1 7.0 6.4 39.6 31.7 29.7 28.3 28.1 E_Scorecard.indd 50 6/2/14 9:57 AMBefore considering the details, take a quick look at our \"Top 10 by Rank\" chart. It presents a veritable data dogfight, with country rankings soaring up and crashing down, zooming in and out like fighter pilots at war. After six years of building our Scorecard, this one graph might tell the Sci-entific American Worldview story as simply as it can be told: assessing the potential for biotechnology innovation around the world isn't easily done. In order to generate this temporal tracking, we aligned the annual data. Our methodology has changed in the past six years to incorporate new metrics and to better compare the included countries. To account for this, we normal-ized each year's innovation scores to a range of 0-50 (2009 data were on a scale from 0-5). That way, scores could be compared over time. Our results showed that, over the history of the Score- card, even the Top 10 countries had scores that rose and fell dramatically. Although the US score follows a some-what jagged climb through the high 30s, maintaining the lead position, other countries at the top zip up and dip down in the mid-20s to mid-30s range. This bouncing bunch of data points creates even more volatility in the ranking data. For example, Canada's ranking improved in the early years, but then dropped. Israel started at fifth, but has declined steadily, coming in this year at 22nd\u2014so it disappeared from the Top 10 too soon to even be shown here. Denmark, on the other hand, has seen great variability in its score year after year but its rank remains very high. How will these trends turn out as the Scientific Ameri- can Worldview database nears its tenth birthday? No one knows, but we anxiously await the results every year. In the world of biotechnology, remember this: It's a serious data dogfight out there. How each country scores tomorrow depends on the work it does today.

It enables deeply ingrained knowledge and experience to yield ideas that cannot come from a less focused approach. The same can be said of applying spe-cialization to many fields, including biotechnology. So, maybe your country did not make the top of this year's Scorecard\u2014maybe it never has\u2014but your country could still be like royalty by ruling one particular category.According to Max Weber, the 19th- century German sociologist: Only by strict specialization can the scientific worker become fully conscious, for once and perhaps never again in his lifetime, that he has achieved something that will endure. A really definitive and good accomplishment is today al - ways a specialized act. In biotechnology, a \"really defini- tive and good accomplishment\" could emerge from many places. For ex-ample, Saudi Arabia placed far down on the overall Scorecard, but this country captures a win in talent reten-tion, making it the place where more foreign-trained PhDs than any other country say, \"There's no place like home.\" Beyond \"growing\" scientists, a nation can farm its way to the top, and Brazil does just that\u2014taking second in the world for the amount of biotech crops it plants. This map of key-category winners shows the changing landscape of biotech leadership worldwide. The shifts seen on today's map may sug-gest where new centers of innova-tion are likely to emerge tomorrow to address agriculture, energy, envi-ronment and healthcare challenges around the globe.

For scal year 2012\u2014the most recent data available\u2014the US public-company market cap is nearly four times that of the rest of world combined. The closest competitor is Aus-tralia, with a public-company market cap one-twelfth that of the United States. The next closest countries, the United Kingdom and Denmark, have substantially smaller market caps than the United States. Last year, we noted an increase in global market cap, amidst a slight dip for the United States. This led us to question whether it was an early indicator of economic recovery. This year's data make a compelling case for recovery. The US market cap grew by more than $90 billion dollars, and the ex-US market cap continued its upward trend. The results for other leading nations, however, were mixed: Australia saw strong growth, while the United King-dom and Denmark dropped back. The number of public biotechnology companies also keeps decreasing in several countries. The United States has experienced a consistent decline in public companies\u2014279 in our rst issue in 2009 and 214 this year. Given that the nation with the next-most public companies, Australia, has only 42, the decrease in US companies causes no immediate concern. In fact, the market capitalization of US public com-panies has risen since Scienti c American Worldview 2011, and is almost as great as was seen in our 2009 issue. Australia exhibits a similar consolidation trend. Its number of public companies has been slowly dropping after a peak of 48 in our 2012 issue, but its market capital-ization is at an all-time high. For Canada, with the third-most public companies, and the United Kingdom, with the fourth-most, market capitalization has been receding amid decreases in the number of public rms. Conversely, France had previously seen an increase in public compa-nies despite a decrease in market cap. This year's data show that France's total of public rms continues to rise, and the market cap has grown as well. Perhaps France is experiencing the same growth exhibited in the United States and Australia, albeit with a slight lag.2009: 4292010: 3992011: CAP (US$MM) 30,000 25,000 20,000 15,000 10,000 5,00020102009 2011 2012 2013 2014UNITED STATES ALL OTHER COUNTRIES COMBINEDWORLDVIEW SCORECARD 55 E_Scorecard.indd SWEDEN SOUTH KOREATURKEY AUSTRALIAGERMANYUNITED KINGDOM 452 / 16 407 / 13.2 350 / 6.9299 / 13.6 282/ 12.5 276 / 11.7 273 / 17.1 245 / 11.1 238 / 10.4207 / 20.6 199 / 10.1 173 / 11 161 / 11 150 / 12.5 145 / 8.5120 / 21.9119 / 4.9PUBLICATIONS CITATIONS / PUBLICATIONUNITED STATES INDIAUNITED STATES BRAZIL PAKISTAN INDIA CANADA CHINA PARAGUAY SOUTH AFRICA URUGUAY ARGENTINA BOLIVIA PHILIPPINES AUSTRALIA MYANMAR BURKINA FASO SPAIN MEXICOCOLOMBIASUDAN CHILE HONDURAS PORTUGAL CUBA CZECH REPUBLIC COSTA RICA ROMANIA SLOVAKIA <0.1 70.1 40.3 24.4 0.111 10.8 4.2 3.6 2.82.9 1.5 1 0.8 0.6 0.5 0.4GETTING GREENER Agriculture and energy gain more from biotechnology Seemingly every country on earth needs better food and less expensive, more environmentally friendly energy. Biotechnology supplies countries with growing options on both fronts. Agricultural biotechnology keeps spreading further around the world. Although the United States leads the world in acres of biotechnology crops grown, agricultural biotechnology is not dominated by industrialized na-tions. Brazil, in second place with over 40 million hectares of biotechnology crops, plants more than half as much as the United States. Furthermore, the combination of Brazil, Argentina and India exceeds the US's acre-age. According to research from the International Service for the Acqui-sition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), agricultural biotechnology favors smaller farmers and develop-ing countries. Among the 27 countries planting biotechnology crops, the ma-jority\u201419\u2014are developing countries. Developing countries also plant 54 percent of agricultural biotech crops by acreage, and it is estimated that 90 percent of farmers using biotechnol-ogy crops are small and resource-poor farmers.

More than 30,000 publications from the United States indicate the volume, while the collection of countries around the world with hun-dreds of publications shows the breadth. Howev-er, the most telling indicator may be the average numbers of citations per article. On that metric, Austria and Turkey command the lead\u2014surpass-ing the United States by more than 30 percent. In the future, the agricultural and energy aspects of biotechnology will continue to expand. Moreover, these areas will draw an increasing proportion of the interest in biotechnology around the globe. SOURCE: Yaoyang, X. & Boeing, W.J.

Inves-tors from different countries are likely to differ in how they view investment opportunities in other countries. Geographic proximity, compatibility of legal and financial systems, and even cultural factors can influence how ea-ger parties in one country are to invest in those from another. The recent Deloitte Venture Capital Survey provides an excellent source for these individual country prefer-ences. The creators of this survey asked venture capitalists from selected countries about their confidence in in-vesting in other nations. The data show several interesting patterns. France and Japan are generally not seen as good targets for foreign venture capital investment, while the United States and Israel are generally preferred. Also, German venture capitalists have the greatest confidence in investing outside their country, whereas Austra-lians had the least overall international confidence. The proximity of Germany to established markets throughout Europe, and the relative distance from Australia to similarly mature markets suggest that this might simply be a matter of travel distance. 58 OTHER COUNTRIES' OVERALL CONFIDENCE IN AVERAGE CONFIDENCE IN OTHER COUNTRIES E_Scorecard.indd 58 6/3/14 4:05 PMJAPAN NETHERLANDS UNITED JAPANNETHERLANDSSINGAPORESOUTH AFRICATAIWANUNITED KINGDOMUNITED STATES4 3 2 1 AUSTRALIA BRAZIL4 3 2 1 CANADA ISRAEL INDIA CHINA4 3 2 1 GERMANY4 3 2 14 3 2 14 3 2 14 3 2 1 4 3 2 14 3 2 14 3 2 14 3 2 15 03 42 1 5 03 42 1 5 03 42 1 5 03 42 1 5 03 42 1 5 03 42 1 5 03 42 1 5 03 42 1 5 03 42 1 5 03 42 1 5 03 42 1BRAZIL CANADA INDIA ISRAEL JAPAN NETHERLANDS TAIWAN SOUTH AFRICA UNITED STATES UNITED KINGDOMAUSTRALIA 5 03 42 1 5 03 42 1 CHINA GERMANY 4 3 2 14 3 2 1 SOURCE: Deloitte Global Venture Capital Survey, 2013BIOPHARMACEUTICALS MEDICAL DEVICES & EQUIPMENT HEALTHCARE IT & SERVICESAlso shown here is a global survey of investor confidence in sev- eral biotechnology-related sectors: biopharmaceuticals, medical devices and equipment, and healthcare IT and services. Interestingly, despite the success of American companies in bio-technology and the substantial market cap of American biotech firms\u2014an indicator of receptive stock markets, which facilitate the profitable liquida-tion of investments in promising com-panies\u2014US venture capitalists appear to lack confidence in biopharmaceu-ticals and medical devices. The only country in which biopharmaceuticals were preferred was the Netherlands. This survey reveals that some decisions in business surely depend on qualitative rather than quantitative thinking. Data do not guide all of the decision-making in biotechnology, or any other industry, for that matter. OVERALL CONFIDENCE IN VC INVESTING IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICALS SECTOR E_Scorecard.indd 59 6/3/14 4:05 PM60 R&D EXPENDITURES R&D funding (US$BN) BIOTECH'S BIG SPENDERS Innovation demands investment in R&D Sustained investments in R&D are the key to biotechnology innovation. The United States used to spend more on R&D than the entire world combined, and it still invests more than any other country. That investment surely fueled the emergence and ongoing dominance of the US biotechnol-ogy sector. Beyond gross numbers, the source of nancial sup- port\u2014public or industry\u2014impacts the type of research done. In many countries, public funding is usually dedi-cated to more fundamental research studies, while industry funding tends to be directed at developing commercial products. Here, we show R&D funding from public and industrial sources for select nations and regions. This data presentation includes three elements: the magnitude of the investments, the relative proportion of each type of funding and the change in funding over time. The United States and Europe lead biomedical R&D but, along with Canada, are demonstrating a downward trend. Furthermore, whereas Canada's decrease appears to be due to lower levels of public funding\u2014potentially eroding basic science foundations\u2014the decreases in Europe and the United States appear to stem from less industry fund-ing. China's biomedical R&D shows strong growth, fueled by industry, but it is still less than Japan's. China recently surpassed Japan as the world's second largest economy, so it is anticipated that their biomedical R&D should con-tinue to grow. These data also reveal the diversity of levels of R&D investing. In part, perhaps in large part, that explains the range of success, as well.2009 2010 SOURCE: Chakma, J., Asia's ascent\u2014global trends in R&D expenditures. N. Engl. J.

A tragic irony is that this life-threatening infection often takes root in places thought to be sterile, such as hos - pitals. To make matters worse, like many bacteria, MRSA is a moving target, one that is always evolving. Protecting against it means scientists must constantly create new di - agnostics to keep up with these changes. Rising to this challenge, one Danish biotech devel - oped a technique that could help healthcare systems track MRSA with greater precision. In the coastal town of Hvi - dovre, just south of Copenhagen, researchers at Anapa Biotech tweaked the well-known polymerase chain reac - tion into an effective and sensitive MRSA detector. Their test, which could soon be available around the globe, is one illustration of why Scandinavian countries consistently occupy the top positions on the Scientific American World- view Scorecard, leading the world in biotech innovation. To be specific, since the Scorecard was introduced in 2009, Denmark, Finland and Sweden have landed in the top ten, and often the top five, spots. Norway, on the oth - er hand, has finished much farther down the list. In ad - dition to finishing near the top, these countries perform consistently. In 2009, Denmark was number three on the Scorecard. It dropped to fifth place in 2010, then held sec - ond place three years in a row, and now is back in third place this year. Sweden bounced between the third and sixth spots, including two years each at fourth and fifth place. Finland can boast a similar record, ranging between fourth and eighth place. So the obvious question is: What fuels these strong regional performances?RANKINGS AND REPUTATIONSTo a certain extent, particular features of the Scorecard play to Scandinavia's strengths. As Yali Friedman, lead editorial consultant for Scientific American Worldview , ex- plains, the \"Policy and Stability\" category was added to the Scorecard three years ago, and the Scandinavian countries tend to be strong in this area. In this year's Scorecard, for example, Finland took the top spot in this category, with Sweden and Norway in third and sixth place, respectively. For comparison, the United States barely made it into the top 20, with a 19th-place finish. As an industry, biotechnology requires a highly skilled workforce, one that must be educated and inspired to suc - ceed. The Scandinavian countries enjoy a good reputation in this area, with a world-renowned educational system. There is a sense that these nations encourage an occupa - tional drive in their citizens that promotes self-improve - ment and actualization within the workplace across all industries. As Joan Steitz, a molecular biologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, says, \"Standards for hiring and promotion are high\u2014so the outcome is good.\" The Scorecard results, interestingly, do not always support this general reputation. In the 2014 \"Education/Workforce\" category, all three countries struggled. Al - though Denmark scored the best in this category, it only reached 13th place. Finland took the 15th spot and Sweden was ranked 21st. Incidentally, all of Scandinavia does not excel on the Scorecard. In this year's \"Education/Workforce\" category, for instance, Norway landed in the bottom half of all coun - tries, at 32nd place. In fact, throughout the history of the Scorecard, Norway did its best in the first year, when it was ranked 17th. Since then, this country has lingered in the vicinity of the 20th spot.SECRETS OF SCANDINAVIAN SUCCESS Why are Sweden, Denmark and Finland the Scorecard superstars? 62 BY KAYLA GREGORY E_Scorecard.indd 62 6/2/14 12:13 PMPURSUING PRODUCTS Ultimately, achievement in the biotech sector depends upon the ability to create and market products. As Fried - man points out, Scandinavia has a strong focus on gen - erating an internationally active biotech industry, and consistently participates in a large amount of research. It's these fundamentals that are the \"secrets\" to its success in developing new products and innovations. And looking to the future, certain indicators bode well for Scandinavian biotech. According to Hans Jeppsson, a researcher at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who studies the financial side of biotechnology, \"The Nordic clinical pipeline has grown from 18 to 53 projects over the time period [2000-2010].\" To safeguard innovative ideas long enough to get bio - tech products to market, countries also need to provide secure patent protection. On this year's Scorecard, Den - mark earned first place by registering more biotechnology patents\u2014as a percentage of total patents registered\u2014than any other nation. Sweden and Finland, however, did not perform as well, finishing side by side in 26th and 27th place, respectively. Here, Norway did a little better, rela - tively speaking, ranking 23rd.MAINTAINING THE MOMENTUMBiotech companies tend to be only as successful as their most recent efforts, and can't rest on their laurels for long. Sus - tained investment is key to staying on top in this industry. A country's level of investment can be assessed in vari - ous ways. For example, Jeppsson relates that Sweden boasts the \"largest number of clinical trial projects per GDP\" in the world. The Scorecard incorporates this type of invest - ment in its rankings, calculating the amount spent on bio - technology R&D as a percentage of a country's GDP. This year, Finland, Sweden and Denmark placed fourth, fifth and eighth, respectively, on this measurement. Norway, on the other hand, landed in 25th. Nevertheless, these num - bers reveal considerable investment in biotech innovation. Not everything in Scandinavia's biotech landscape is picture perfect, however. As for every other region, this hyper-competitive sector presents its share of challenges. For example, biotechnology firms in Scandinavia tend to go abroad when going public. \"European private biotech companies turn to the US and list on NASDAQ rather than in their home countries,\" Jeppsson says. That stumbling block aside, the ongoing high-level performances of Scandinavian nations on the Scientific American Worldview Scorecard reflect the region's com - petitive standing in the industry. Their stability and gov - ernment involvement in funding and policies has given them an advantage over other countries without the re - sources or priorities to generate growth in the biotechnol - ogy sector. As J. Rune Sandell, owner of California-based Sandell Consulting, puts it, the success of Scandinavian biotech can be attributed to \"general high levels of edu - cation and a very entrepreneurial society.\" Those features alone go a long way in this business.DENMARK SWEDENFINLANDNORWAY 2015105 Recording the rankings reveals top trends for three of the four countries in the region (2009-2014). There is a sense that these nations encourage an occupational drive in their citizens that promotes self-improvement and actualization within the workplace across all industries.WORLDVIEW SCORECARD 63 E_Scorecard.indd 63 6/2/14 12:13 PM The Scorecard is wrong! My country does far better in biotechnol - ogy innovation than that! We\u2014the edito - rial team of Scien - tific American World - view \u2014hear protests like these every year. People intent on explaining how the data or the analysis showed their country in a poor, and they say un - deserved, light have tracked us down around the world. It's a natural result, I suppose, of building a list. We expected to trigger differing opinions from the moment that we published the Scorecard. And we an - ticipated even greater disgruntlement when we started listing the results in descending order. Indeed, we expect these disagreements to continue year after year. Throughout the Scorecard's life, and probably beyond, readers will likely take issue with how Coun - try A stacks up against Country B in the arena of biotech innovation. But before you decide that the Scientific American Worldview Scorecard gets it wrong, take a look at its correlations to a number of important indices. DOES MONEY MATTER? In 2013, a friend of mine suggested that I compare the Scorecard results with the World Bank's GNI (gross na - tional income) per capita. The World Bank calculates this figure as a coun - try's gross income divided by its pop - ulation in the middle of the year. This metric provides a very compressed indication of a nation's overall finan - cial well-being, at least on the level of the average citizen. It's easy enough to imagine that the GNI per capita might impact biotechnology innova -tion, because anyone informed about this field knows that it takes money to innovate. Imagining such a correla - tion is one thing, but do the data sup - port that hypothesis? To find out, I plotted the current GNI per capita figures for the coun - tries on our list versus their 2014 Scorecard values. The results (see \"Pay to Play\") show a largely tight scatter along a positive correlation\u2014a higher GNI per capita correlates with a higher Scorecard value. In fact, the linear re - gression analysis of the data produces a correlation coefficient of 0.75, where 1.00 represents a perfect correlation. Despite that good fit, this corre - lation analysis, like most correlation analyses, produces imperfect results. Some countries, particularly Kuwait and Norway, land high above the re - gression line, meaning that they fin - ish lower in the Scorecard value than the GNI per capita alone would pre - dict. Conversely, the United States lands quite a bit below the line, which indicates that it performs better on the Scorecard than would be expected based solely on its average income. This comparison points to sev - eral conclusions. First and foremost, the high degree of correlation adds strength to the rankings of the Score - card. Second, it indicates that personal income alone does not determine in - novative ability in biotechnology. A strong focus on biotech investment, which the United States clearly pos - sesses, has a greater impact on innova - tion than its average national income. INVESTOR INSIGHT When someone makes a living decid - ing where to invest money, that person needs to know the most likely sources of productivity. Which countries offer the best conditions for invest - ment? To find out, Alexander Groh of the Emlyon Business School in \u00c9cully, France, and Heinrich Liech - tenstein and Karsten Lieser, both from the IESE Business School in Barcelona, Spain, developed the 2013 Venture Capital and Private Equity Country Attractiveness (VCPECA) index. They set out on what they call a \"comprehensive research project\" on how to measure the appeal a region holds for investors. The question here is: Does a na - tion's overall attractiveness to inves - tors correlate with its innovation po - tential in biotechnology as measured by the Scorecard? As with the GNI per capita, I compared the 2013 VCPECA data with the 2014 Scorecard values. As shown in \"VC vs. SC,\" the data hug the regression line even more closely than the GNI data do, and the corre - lation coefficient of 0.81 reflects a very tight relationship. This result arises despite the fact that the VCPECA explores investing in general and the Scorecard focuses solely on biotech. So this finding begs another question: How high might the correlation rise if the Scorecard values could be com - pared to the attractiveness of invest - ing specifically in biotechnology? Interestingly, employing the same procedure with our 2013 Scorecard values produced a slightly lower cor - relation coefficient, 0.77. This might suggest that the modifications to this year's Scorecard make a measurable enhancement in the overall findings. At any rate, this second high cor - relation further strengthens the case for the relevance of the Scorecard rankings. SCORING THE CARD Comparisons with other indices suggest the Scorecard is tracking with the trends 64 BY MIKE MAY E_Scorecard.indd 64 6/2/14 12:14 PMCONSIDER THE POSSIBILITIES We understand the impulse to call the Scorecard wrong if the results reflect unfavorably on your country. The correlations given here, however, argue against such impulses. Even more, these comparisons highlight the broad potential application of the Scorecard. By design, it explores a wide range of innovative capabilities in biotechnology. Likewise, the indi - ces selected for comparison here\u2014essentially the average income in a country and its investor appeal\u2014ap - ply to wide areas of interest, not just biotechnology. Keep in mind that the Scientific American Worldview Scorecard itself covers all of biotechnology, rather than simply agriculture, energy, in - dustry or medicine. Consequently, a country that focuses on one of these areas might not perform well on the Scorecard. Our rankings seek to assess a country's capabilities in biotechnol - ogy's innovation decathlon, which en - compass a broad range of skills. Instead of a competition, however, today's biotech sector offers an op - portunity for international teamwork that can improve the lives of people worldwide. More than ever, innova - tion in biotechnology demands global participation in order to create ad - vanced sources of energy, improved healthcare and a new generation of products that enhance everyday life in countries around the world. So when you look at the Score - card, keep these correlations in mind. The data analysis behind this project delivers a strong message\u2014one cor - roborated by unrelated databases. This information can be used to con - struct a better world for all of us. VC vs .

Here, we dive deeper into the coun - tries, companies and people who work so hard to make this industry thrive. Adopting a tighter focus than in the past, this year we take readers on a tour of the biotechnology sector in Brazil\u2014an en - ergetic upstart that has earned a striking level of confidence from venture capitalists\u2014via on-the-ground reporting to get a clear picture of what it is that makes this country a beacon to investors. However, with an area larger than the continental US to investigate, one visit to Brazil cannot re - veal more than a fraction of its flourishing biotech industry. The country's diversity extends not only to its terrain\u2014composed of beaches, rolling hills and mountains\u2014but also to its people, many of whom have emigrated from around the world. Consequently, it's not surprising that Brazil's approach to biotechnology exhibits a similar diversity. T o the best of our abilities, we have covered a variety of regions within this nation and consulted with a wide range of its biotech firms and experts, some focused on healthcare, others on agriculture and energy. By exploring biotechnology around the world, we obtain a better understanding of the vast array of challenges and capabilities that it offers. The Brazilian biotech industry, in particular, reflects the in - ternational character of this field\u2014with its entrepreneurial spirit and reliance on global teams built to solve problems together, and then to share their solutions with neighbors near and far. We deeply appreciate the generosity and kindness of our Brazilian hosts. Without them, we could never have gained the level of insight into their country's biotech sector that we present here. We hope that our readers enjoy the results of our journey as much as we did taking it. \u2014THE EDITORSTIGHTENING THE FOCUS F_Profiles.indd 66 5/30/14 11:53 AMBRAZILIAN BIOTECH 67 n a Thursday afternoon in June 2013, 72,000 people crowded into Ma - racan\u00e3 Stadium in Rio de Janeiro for a match between Spain and Ta - hiti. Although this game of foot - ball (a.k.a. \"soccer\" in the US) was dominated by the extremely polished Spanish players, the Brazilian fans cheered for the struggling squad from Tahiti. Whenever a Tahitian player kicked the ball, even out of bounds, the stands erupted. On two occasions, Tahiti got a decent shot on goal, and the crowd went wild\u2014even after the Spanish goalkeeper blocked the kick. Clearly, the Brazilians love the underdog (Spain won that match, 10 to 0) and it's that same spirit that drives their country's burgeoning biotech sector. Like the football crowd cheering the Tahitian players through a challenging match, government and indus - try leaders in Brazil are supporting the country's biotech sector in its efforts to become a major player in the field. And, as the Scientific American Worldview Scorecard has illustrated, Brazil is showing improvement. In 2010 and 2011, it finished in the bottom 10 percent of the nations on the Scorecard. It climbed above the bottom 20 per - cent in 2012, and nearly out of the bottom third in 2013. With some changes in this year's analysis, Brazil lost some ground, but still finished nearly out of the bottom 20 per - cent. Moreover, in a 2012 Deloitte poll that ranked the confidence levels venture capitalists had regarding invest - ment in various countries, Brazil placed second, behind the United States. Overall, this biotechnology underdog\u2014ranked fifth in area and population in the world\u2014deserves its growing respect. Despite the improvements in Brazil's biotechnology in - dustry, the nation does lack some of the resources necessary for taking on the role of an international power player. As I found out during a tour of some of the country's facilities, more than a few Brazilians plan to accomplish their goals in the field through collaborations with foreign partners.BUILDING A BIOLOGICS INDUSTRY Before the football match, Odnir Finotti, CEO of BioNo - vis, sits down with me in the lobby of the JW Marriott Hotel Rio de Janeiro. He explains that Brazilians get free healthcare, but they do not get access to all medicines, es - pecially some of today's most advanced biologics. Finotti leans forward in his chair and says, \"Monoclonal antibod - ies are quite expensive, and normal families cannot afford treatment for cancer, et cetera.\" The difficulty is that Brazil cannot make these drugs. \"We have no plants dedicated to producing monoclonal antibodies, so we're almost starting from scratch.\" He hopes to solve that problem through partnering, particu - larly with companies that have desirable monoclonal an - tibody-based drugs that are off patent. A company with such a drug could partner with BioNovis and get 10 years of exclusivity selling the drug in Brazil. Such a partner, he explains, must simply agree to manufacture the drug in Brazil at a BioNovis facility. But many biologics makers won't find that deal so sim - ple. It entails bringing a cell line to Brazil and replicating the entire manufacturing process in a Brazil-owned facility. The technical issues create some challenges, but the larger concerns probably revolve around intellectual property. If a company holds the cell line that generates the biologic and the manufacturing know-how to make it, maybe it doesn't really need Brazil's promise of a decade of exclusivity. May - be no other company\u2014in Brazil or beyond\u2014can make the biologic anyway. When I ask what response he gets when he offers a firm this deal, he says, \"Some companies agree, and others are struggling to understand.\" Still, BioNovis plans to build a manufacturing facility and, eventually, its own R&D center, where it can develop innovative biologics. All of BioNovis's advances so far have depended on government-funded \"productive develop - ment policies,\" or PDPs. The PDPs range from government loans to tax breaks. At the time of my visit, BioNovis had received seven PDPs.POWER PARTNERING How Alliances Fuel Brazilian Biotech BY MIKE MAY F_Profiles.indd 67 5/30/14 11:54 AM68 BY MIKE MAY The Brazilian government also provided four PDPs for Orygen Biotecnologia, which emerged as a joint venture between four Brazilian companies: Biolab, Eurofarma, Crist\u00e1lia and Libbs. Later, Libbs and Crist\u00e1lia the partnership, but Orygen pushed forward. As Bruna Alario, strategic innovation manager at Biolab, told me over dinner, \"The remaining companies put their biotech projects in Orygen.\" Orygen has already received approval for four biosimilars, and has several innovative products in its pipeline. Recepta, located in S\u00e3o Paulo, is another Brazilian biotech that knows the value of teamwork. Jos\u00e9 Fernando Perez, the firm's president, says his company is dedicated to conducting R&D and clinical trials for new cancer treatments, including monoclonal antibodies and pep - tides. Recepta has partnerships with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in New York City and 4-Antibody in Basel, Switzerland, to develop antibodies for cancer therapy. However, working with Brazil's regula - tory agency, Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Vigil\u00e2n - cia Sanit\u00e1ria (Anvisa), takes experience. \"Because this is a new field we're explor - ing, the people at Anvisa don't always know what to do technically,\" Alario says. Priscila Scheinberg, regulatory affairs manager at Orygen, agrees: \"Companies should not expect Anvisa to tell them what to do.\" Which means that Brazilian pharmaceutical firms need to develop their own expertise if they want to take a biological drug through the regulatory process. BEYOND THE BEACH My biotechnology tour starts in earnest with a Friday morning cab ride with Norberto Prestes, a Bio-Rio con - sultant, along the Copacabana beach\u2014a world-renowned stretch of sand longer than 30 football fields. The driver turns north, working through small streets before emerg - ing on a highway that passes the ports. We cross a bridge to an island in Guanabara Bay and stop at the Bio-Rio Bio - technology Park. Bio-Rio started promoting biotechnology in Brazil in 1988, without any financial support. Eventually, in 1995, it received government funding. To survive that long, Katia Aguiar, business manager at Bio-Rio, relied on her natural instincts. \"We are fighters,\" she says. They had to be. Agu - iar and her colleagues nurtured this organization from nothing to become what it is today, an invaluable source of support to 472 projects. Basically, when a person or com - pany comes to Aguiar with an idea, she determines if Bio-Rio can help. The assistance it offers ranges from providing space where the company pays rent to a variety of free ser - vices, including legal advice and reviewing budgets.To work with Bio-Rio, a company must meet two cri - teria. First, it must be innovative. Second, as Aguiar says, it \"must work for life, not against it.\" Thus, a firm devel - oping biological weapons, for instance, would not be eli - gible. Aguiar would have it no other way. As she walks me through the buildings housing Bio-Rio partners, she says, \"These are my babies.\" On this winter morning\u2014hot enough to be consid - ered summer in any temperate country\u2014we tour the Bio-Rio campus as Aguiar explains that each company needs to plant a garden around its building. \"You should be as comfortable at work as at home,\" she says, pointing out fruit trees, some bearing young mangoes, which surround several buildings. Nearly any place in Rio de Janeiro feels closely connected to the natural world, and at Bio-Rio, that connection stretch - es from fruit trees on the ground to dozens\u2014sometimes hundreds\u2014of mag-nificent frigate birds circling in the sky. This organiza - tion's first partner, AMBIO, also re - flects that bond with nature, with its mission of producing systems that use microorganisms to treat water and wastewater. Likewise, other Bio-Rio companies blend technology with human biology. For instance, Cryopraxis collects and stores stem-cell samples taken from umbilical-cord blood. Bio-Rio partners also focus on building bonds between academia and industry. For example, Hygeia Biotech works as a contract research organization (CRO) that helps university scientists turn ideas and research into products. To fund future projects, Hygeia Biotech developed a 50-50 partnership with the Brazilian pharmaceutical company Crist\u00e1lia. This collaboration, says Joari De Miranda, Hyge - ia's scientific director, is pivotal to the firm's success. \"We are at the turning point,\" he says, where Hygeia could be - come financially profitable. Like any young biotechnology company, though, only time will tell that tale. The partnering underway at Hygeia is indicative of the way Bio-Rio works to advance its projects. It's a tendency, Aguiar says, that applies to Brazil in general: \"Partnering is in our blood.\" To witness this process in action, I wait in AMBIO's lobby. As I relax on a couch with Aguiar and Prestes, An - gelo Luiz Monteiro de Barros, of AMBIO and president of Bio-Rio, descends silently, 007-like in a pneu - matic vacuum elevator that appears to consist of only a disk to stand on inside a plastic tube. \"Nice entrance,\" I say. Nearly any place in Rio de Janeiro feels closely connected to the natural world, and at Bio-Rio, that connection stretches from fruit trees on the ground to dozens\u2014sometimes hundreds\u2014 of magnificent frigate birds circling in the sky. F_Profiles.indd 68 6/2/14 2:18 PMBRAZILIAN BIOTECH 69 Barros's eyebrows rise high into his forehead and a broad smile covers his face as he shakes my hand. While driving me to lunch in his Range Rover, he says, \"When you deal with life, with biotechnology, you need to un - derstand that it's like wine.\" That analogy fits well with AMBIO's mission. Treating water with microorganisms depends on where the process takes place and what gets added. Likewise, achieving success in the biotech industry depends heavily on where, when and what is in the mix. Much of Bio-Rio's work involves mixing the right partners. To extend the opportunities it offers, the orga - nization has developed partnerships in Belgium, Poland and other countries, and has opened an office in Chicago. \"We've talked to the governor of Illinois about developing some of our extracts as drugs,\" Barros says. Bio-Rio has a lot to offer in this regard, as it possesses more than 36,000 samples of natural extracts\u2014not surprising for a country that is home to about 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest. Research is already in the works on how to aim that extract arsenal at Staphylococcus aureus . Barros calls this bacterium \"the champion of hospital infections.\" In the past it has flourished with deadly results, as a 1941 article in the Archives of Internal Medicine reported that it killed nearly 82 percent of the patients that it infected at Boston City Hospital. In the 1940s, antibiotics were created that could con - trol S. aureus , but not for long. It developed penicillin re - sistance in the 1950s, followed by methicillin resistance in the 1960s, leading to the so-called methicillin-resistant S. aureus , or MRSA. A 2012 article in Emerging Infectious Diseases reports that more than 31 percent of patients with MRSA at the Mount Sinai Medical Center died in 2002-2007. Worse still, this bacterium continues to acquire re - sistance to other drugs. In 2002, for example, vancomycin-resistant S . aureus emerged in the United States. Over a delicious lunch of grilled salt cod, Barros ex - plains that researchers screened the Bio-Rio extracts that held the potential for battling S. aureus , and 40 showed promise. \"One can be formulated as a cream,\" Barros says, \"and it's very effective.\" VACCINE VERTICALS As Barros finishes that story, we drive through an ex - tremely poor neighborhood. I begin to understand\u2014see - ing some of the disparity of wealth firsthand\u2014why hun - dreds of thousands of Brazilians have been taking to the streets in protest during my visit. It all started over a 9-cent increase in the bus fares, but it soon spread to anger over taxes and a general lack of services, such as education and hospitals. At one protest in Rio, according to a CNN re - port, someone held a sign saying, \"I'd swap 10 stadiums for one decent hospital in this country.\" The stadiums that the protester had in mind were planned to enable Brazil to host the 2014 World Cup. As I watch people wandering by boarded-up buildings, I feel a long way from the champagne that was served in the guest suites at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. Just then, Barros pulls into the Oswaldo Cruz Founda - tion, better known in Brazil as Fiocruz\u2014part of Brazil's Ministry of Health. In 1900, Fiocruz started as the Federal Seropathy Institute, which was created to fight the plague in Brazil. Now, more than a century later, Fiocruz makes up Latin America's largest science and technology insti - tution. He drops me off at Bio-Manguinhos: The Immu - nobiological Technology Institute, which was created to organize the production of vaccines within Fiocruz. Moments later, vice director of production Antonio de Padua R. Barbosa explains that Bio-Manguinhos develops vaccines, biopharmaceuticals and in vitro diagnostics, or IVDs. \"We provide to the National Program of Immuniza - tion, NPI, the majority of vaccines needed for Brazil, and the NPI distributes it for free to all the population,\" he says. In most cases, Bio-Manguinhos develops its products through partnerships. Fiocruz developed its first partner - ship in 1937 with the Rockefeller Foundation to develop F_Profiles.indd 69 6/2/14 2:18 PM70 BY MIKE MAY the yellow fever vaccine. More recently, in 1999, Bio-Man- guinhos established another partnership with the Belgium vaccine manufacturer SmithKline Beecham, now GSK, to produce the Hib vaccine against childhood infections of Haemophilus influenzae b . As Barbosa says, \"Partnerships are the fastest ways to get products to the population.\" As of 2013, the Bio-Manguinhos portfolio includ- ed 10 vaccines, two biopharmaceuticals and 11 in vi - tro diagnostic reagents. In addition, it had 36 more prod - ucts in development. Once the supply fulfills Brazil's needs, Bio-Manguinhos exports the surplus to other countries. For example, from 2001 through 2012, it exported its yel - low fever and meningitis vaccines to 74 nations. In 2013, Bio-Manguinhos expanded its portfolio with the biophar - maceutical Taliglucerase alfa, against Gaucher's Disease. The list of Bio-Manguinhos's products is bound to get longer. A re - cent law was approved that will allow it to become a public company, which will enhance its flexibility. I see the preparations underway as Lucas Ros - setti, of the firm's business develop - ment and marketing division, gives me a tour of the new Integrated Cen - ter for Prototypes, Biopharmaceuticals and IVD Reagents, which will dramatically expand the potential output of Bio-Manguinhos. For Brazil, this expansion comes not a moment too soon. \"Without this new facility, we have a bottleneck in production, because the demand from the Ministry of Health keeps expanding,\" Rossetti says. As an example, he points out that the country's need for vaccines alone surpassed 97 million doses in 2013. Hoping to also help the families living nearby, Bio-Man - guinhos provides education through social projects. Unfor - tunately, they represent just a fraction of Brazilians in need of assistance. According to The World Bank, Brazil's gross national income per capita is US$11,630. While not high, that amount is far above the country's 2003 figure of around US$3,000. It's an impressive level of growth\u2014nearly 300 percent in a decade\u2014that most countries can only dream of. SWEETENING SUGARCANE'S SUCCESS Over the weekend, I fly to S\u00e3o Paulo for a tour of Centro de Tecnologia Canavieira (CTC). Early on Monday morning, Prestes and his colleague, Afonso Figueiredo, pick me up for a two-hour drive to the city of Piracicaba, northwest of S\u00e3o Paulo. The name of this city, coming from Brazil's indigenous Tupi people, means the \"place where the fish stops,\" because the waterfalls of the Piracicaba River run through the city. But for me it seems more like the \"place where the sugarcane starts,\" since that is just what the sci - entists at CTC study.The fields of sugarcane begin to appear not far beyond S\u00e3o Paulo. The longer we drive, the more they spread in every direction. This tall grass, growing higher than even the tallest humans, arrived from Asia. People domesti - cated it thousands of years ago, perhaps as early as 8000 bce in New Guinea. Most of us, including Prestes, think of sugarcane as producing a sweetener. \"We'd take pieces of sugarcane and chew them as children,\" he recalls. Brazil grows more sugarcane than any other country. This crop covers about 9 million hectares\u2014roughly three times the area of Belgium. Beyond using it as a sweetener, Brazil also turns sugarcane into ethanol. According to Brazil's Balan\u00e7o Energ\u00e9tico Nacional, sugarcane generated almost 18 percent of the country's energy in 2010\u2014more than hydropower and second only to petroleum. \"We want to attract partners not only for the molecular markers but to improve sugarcane using all the biotech tools we can imagine: genes, transformation techniques, propagation, synthetic biology, et cetera\" \u2014JAIME FINGUERUT F_Profiles.indd 70 5/30/14 11:59 AMBRAZILIAN BIOTECH 71 After a couple hours of highway driving, we turn onto a dirt road that wanders between sugarcane fields. Figueiredo negotiates around a few trucks loaded with sugarcane to get us inside the CTC. In just minutes, Jai - me Finguerut, of CTC's industrial strategic development group, starts a presentation about the history of sugarcane and its use in biofuels. He states his central point concisely: \"Sugarcane is quite far from the theoretical maximum yield.\" Today's fields produce about 73-78 metric tons per hectare, but Finguerut says that raising that number to 200 is reason - able. To get there, sugarcane needs to be optimized for its environment, and that takes breeding and biotechnology. Currently, the CTC's germplasma bank houses about 5,000 sugarcane strains. \"So we can cover almost any situation for breeding sugarcane,\" Finguerut says. The re - searchers at CTC use those strains and traditional breed - ing approaches to fine-tune the crop to specific conditions. \"The idea of planting the right plant in the right area is growing,\" he says. It reminds me of an agricultural version of the philosophy behind personalized medicine. Nonetheless, improvements in the process of turning sugarcane into ethanol have plateaued in recent years. For example, the amount of sugar produced per hectare is lev - eling off. Moreover, the yield of ethanol from fermentation stopped growing in the early 1990s. To increase the output and profits from this industry, Finguerut says, \"we need some breakthroughs. We need new ideas.\" Biotechnology could provide those ideas. As Finguerut walks me through one lab, he explains that he and his col - leagues are already looking for molecular markers in sug - arcane that indicate the likelihood of success under differ - ent conditions. \"We are already 'cracking the code' of the sugarcane DNA in our own laboratory and experimental stations, using very expensive imported equipment,\" he explains, \"but we need much more analytical power.\" He plans to solve this problem the Brazilian way\u2014by partner - ing. \"We want to attract partners not only for the molecu - lar markers but to improve sugarcane using all the biotech tools we can imagine: genes, transformation techniques, propagation, synthetic biology, et cetera,\" he says. Finguerut hopes that the CTC will soon release a ver - sion of sugarcane that includes the pest-resistant features that come from Bacillus thuringiensis . This could help the plant to fight off its main pest, the sugarcane borer. OBSTACLES IN AGBIOTECH On my last morning in Brazil, I sit in the lobby of Hotel Trianon Paulista, more or less in the center of S\u00e3o Paulo. While I wait for Paulo Andrade, a consultant on agbiotech regulations at TargetDNA who served for six years on Bra - zil's National Technical Commission on Biosafety (CTN - Bio), I look over the country's agbiotech statistics, which are impressive. Only the United States grew more biotech crops than Brazil in 2012. That year, Brazil planted 36.6 million hect - ares\u2014more than half as much as the United States\u2014of biotech crops, including cotton, maize and soybeans. In fact, Brazil grew 21 percent of the world's biotech crops in 2012, according to the International Service for the Ac - quisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA). Further - more, Brazil's agbiotech sector is poised to grow. Between 2009 and 2012, the country increased its area of planted biotech crops more than any other nation. The expansion of biotech farming in Brazil is clearly documented in the ISAAA's Brazil: Biotech Facts & Trends 2013 : \"Brazil approved no less than a record nine biotech crops in 2009, eight in 2010, an additional six approvals in 2011, with just three in 2012 (until October), making it the country with the fastest approval rate for biotech crops globally and one of the most rigid and detailed methods for approvals, by CTNBio.\" As I finish reading that statement, Andrade arrives. I soon realize that he might agree with ISAAA that Brazil's approval system for biotech crops is \"rigid and detailed,\" F_Profiles.indd 71 6/2/14 2:21 PM72 BY MIKE MAY but he considers that more bad than good. In fact, when I ask him his opinion of the biggest agbiotech challenge in Brazil, he quickly says that it is reducing the costs of the agbiotech regulatory system. \"It works,\" he says, \"but it's very expensive.\" Indeed, Andrade calls the system un - necessarily expensive. Describing the process of fulfilling the regulatory commission requirements for a new GMO crop, he says, \"some of the questions are redundant and useless, and still they require experiments.\" In some cases, he says, the regulatory hoops for a new GM plant can cost the developer US$4 million. As Andrade stresses, that cost really challenges small biotechnology companies, \"which are the core of biotech innovation anywhere in the world, including Brazil. These costs prevent the Brazilian private sector from developing its own products and almost oblige the country to be just a technology importer.\" BUYING BIOTECH MUSCLE During my trip to Brazil, I didn't meet anyone who suggest - ed that the Brazilian government holds back on investing in biotech. Quite the contrary. One expert in Brazilian bio - technology, who didn't wish to be named, even described the research system in S\u00e3o Paulo as \"overfunded.\" More than one person I spoke to echoed this account. While ev - eryone knows that success in this industry requires ma - jor investment, the overall pot of Brazilian biotech dollars looms very large, and keeps getting larger.At the 65th Annual Meeting of the Brazilian Associa - tion for the Advancement of Science in July 2013, Brazil's science minister, Marco Antonio Raupp, underscored just how much the pot has grown. Between 2012 and 2013, he said, the country's investment in science jumped from US$3.8 billion to US$5.6 billion. And to put this trend in perspective, Brazil only invested about US$575 million in science in 2002. In other words, in a little over a decade the country's financial commitment to the industry has risen by more than 550 percent. With that kind of spending supporting it, Brazilian biotech is not likely to stay an underdog for long. These ex - ceptional resources\u2014coupled with the country's embrace of new technologies like advanced crops, its commitment to forming strong partnerships at home and abroad, and its determination to be a leader in the field of biotechnol - ogy\u2014are sure to yield advances that will give Brazilians everywhere an awful lot to cheer about. While everyone knows that success in this industry requires major investment, the overall pot of Brazilian biotech dollars looms very large, and keeps getting larger. F_Profiles.indd 72 5/30/14 12:01 PMAUSTRALIA 73 DOUBLE PLAY Immunotherapy delivered with a one-two punch It has always been a good idea: direct the body's immune system to destroy cancer in the same way that it already rids the body of foreign invaders. But making it work has always been the challenge. The emergence of Seattle- based Dendreon's prostate-cancer vaccine\u2014approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010\u2014elevated interest in cancer immunotherapy, and Australia's Ascend Biopharmaceuticals is now building on that success with its cancer immunotherapy vehicle. A new collaboration combines As-cend's targeted delivery technology with a proprietary immune-system boosting compound developed by 3M Drug Delivery Systems in St. Paul, Minnesota. The combination is intended to generate a two-pronged attack on cancer cells. If successful, it would simultaneously generate antibodies against tumor cells and awaken the arm of the immune system that kills foreign cells on contact. The company is hoping that directing the immune system to treat cancer cells more like pathogens will provide a more robust killing response. Clinical testing on an early version of the vaccine platform conducted by the technique's inven-tors at Austin Research (now the Burnet Institute), in Melbourne, piqued the interest of Ascend CEO Clement Leong. \"We've taken what was a very tantalizing scienti c project and really focused on taking that towards a pathway that would produce a product,\" says Leong. \"We've worked on making sure we have a composition that would be acceptable to regulators.\" A recent follow-up to that small double-blind, placebo-controlled immunotherapy trial against stage-two breast cancer showed two of 16 patients receiving the vaccine had a recurrence, versus nine out of 15 patients in the control group. Now Ascend is poised to initiate clinical trials that hinge on sensi-tizing antigen-presenting cells to a sugar-containing protein called mucin-1 found in abundance on cancer cells. A similar sugar poly-mer, mannan, is present on some infectious pathogens, which makes it an attractive target, since antigen-presenting dendritic cells respond to its presence naturally. Working with the immune system's inher-ent triggers has allowed Ascend to generate a potent immune response in preclinical experiments. The research team is betting that toll-like receptors, which recognize substances produced uniquely by pathogens, conju-gated to Ascend's platform will further boost the effectiveness of the vaccine by initiating an im-mediate innate immune response, followed by a durable antibody response and killer T cell response to keep cancer in check. \"It's a race between your ability to mount an immune response and the cancer's ability to grow,\" says Leong. \"Once it outgrows a certain stage, the cancer just shuts down any pros-pect for mounting a viable immune response.\" The company plans to initiate clinical trials in Australia based on its improved breast cancer vaccine in 2015, according to Leong. In the past decade, he says the infra-structure and drug development capabilities within Australia have progressed to the point where it's now possible to design and conduct sophisticated trials. \"We are com-ing of age,\" from Mannan Mannan binds surface receptors delivery of antigen & TLR agonists+ TLR 7 signaling endosome presentation to killer T (CD8+)presentation to helper T cells (CD4+)dendritic cellCOUNTRY SPOTLIGHTS TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS (TLRs) PLUS AN ANTIGEN COMBINE WITH A SUGAR, MANNAN, TO TRIGGER AN IMMUNE RESPONSE THAT COULD BATTLE CANCER. F_Profiles.indd 73 5/30/14 12:52 PM74 AUSTRIA \\ BRAZIL As a landlocked, petroleum- importing central Euro-pean nation, past oil crises crippled Austria. Solutions of the 1970s\u2014giving up driving for one day a week, say\u2014were disappoint-ing. In 1979, the Austrian govern-ment started to investigate the joint production of food, feed and alternative fuels. And so the Austrian biodiesel industry was seeded, in this case literally, with rapeseed oil. Those humble origins have blos- somed into success stories such as BDI, an Austrian biofuels rm head-quartered in Graz that started in the mid-1990s and became a public company in 2006. The company has built dozens of biodiesel and biogas plants across Europe and the United States, notes Dina Bacovsky, a senior researcher at Bioenergy 2020+, a center\" with three locations in Aus-tria. Bioenergy 2020+ operates with a staff of 100 on an annual budget of about US$11 million from a mix of government funding and private contracts. Bioenergy 2020+ serves as a nexus \"between the basic research and the industry,\" Bacovsky says. \"Most of it is applied research for industry, especially in combus-tion. These are all medium-sized enterprises, so they're very happy to have a research competence center, which can do the research for them and with them.\" Besides combustion, the center has projects in gasi cation and fermentation processes to produce biogas. The center has formed partner- ships with such leading research institutions as the Vienna University of Technology, known as TU Wien, to convert basic biomass-energy research into commercial-scale technologies. Bacovsky cites a Bioenergy 2020+ collaboration with TU Wien on a wood \"gasi cation technology piloted at a bioenergy plant in Hungarian \"circulating fl beds.\" This is TU Wien developed to convert woodchips to syngas and, from there, methane and other products. A FAMILY AFFAIR A family business builds partnerships at home and abroad When Biolab Farmac\u00eautica was launched in Brazil in 1997, it was based on an emerging business model: the strategic alliance. Its founders had a strong foundation in the pharma-ceutical sector, having grown up with family members working in the sector . They also understood the importance of partnering with other companies and institutions to forge relationships to bene t all parties. It's a strategy that would make sense to any entrepreneur . Since then, Biolab's collab- orative approach has enabled the company to fl ourish. Cleiton de Castro Marques, chief executive of cer, and his brother Paulo, the company's chief operational of cer, have even added a third owner, Dante Alario, Jr ., who serves as the chief scienti c of cer .

One relationship involves licensing with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly to sell the cholesterol-fighting drug Livalo (pitavastatin) and Evista (raloxifene), which prevents and osteopo-rosis in postmenopausal women. Bi-olab also collaborates with Brazil's Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul to develop nanotechnology-based products for alopecia. Among its other partners are supplement and medical-device companies. For example, Biolab recently went into business with Emcure, an Indian pharmaceutical firm. The licensed partnership, explains Bruna, is a two-year joint venture involving about five products, most of which are small molecules des-tined for the hospital market. \"We know the [health] trends, and one of them is cancer,\" Bruna says. Biolab's first products\u2014for sale in Latin America, the United Arab Emirates and Africa\u2014treat heart disease. They also benefit Brazil's population, in which, according to the World Health Organization, 32 percent of the men have high blood pressure, as do 22 percent of wom- en, and at least 19 percent of men and women are morbidly obese. Other medications in the Biolab pipeline include two nanotech-designed therapies, an antifungal and an anesthetic, which are ready for review by the country's regula-tory approval agency, ANVISA. The company also has two products in preclinical studies, one for erectile dysfunction and the other a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. When the brothers Castro Marques started Biolab, they hoped to improve the public's welfare. From the start, the company supported local artists. In 2000, it began a free sports program for children. \"We have given free karate lessons to hundreds, but in June, we are open-ing up [lessons] to Olympic sports,\" Bruna says. Biolab also sup- ports treatments for children. In 1999, the company started giving 5 percent of the net sales of its pedi-atric line to hospitals treating young oncology patients. So far, Biolab has donated US$1.9 million, which has really made a difference. For example, Daniel Kulisky, fundrais-ing senior analyst for Pequeno Pr\u00edn-cipe Complex, the largest pediatric hospital in Brazil, says that without funding like Biolab's, the hospital couldn't buy what it needs to treat, and therefore save, its young pa-tients. And that's an alliance anyone would endorse. \u2014CHRISTINE BAHLSBacovsky says the project received funding from the European Com-mission as part of a program to stimulate employment in remote areas. The project also aims to make the town energy self-sufficient. In recent weeks, the technology has been exported and commer-cialized in Gothenburg, Sweden, Bacovsky says. In fact, Sweden has been a beneficiary of considerable biofuels R&D because \"they have a lot of wood\" and a tradition of methane use. \"It's very good to be a small country because you know all the important people and institutions and companies, and there's a good spirit of cooperation in Austria,\" Bacovsky says. \"We really know the 200 experts in Austria working on biofuels research.\" \u2014BILL CANNON In 1999, the company started giving 5 percent of the net sales of its pediatric line to hospitals treating young oncology patients.BDI BIOFUELS PLANTS CAN FIGHT OFF FOSSIL-FUEL SHORTAGES. F_Profiles.indd 75 5/30/14 1:00 PM76 CANADA \\ ICELAND BATTLING AN IMBALANCE Canadians collaborate to enhance opportunities for women Although women make up more than 60 percent of Canadians with graduate degrees in the physical and life sciences, the number of biotechnol-ogy companies hiring women fell by 11.5 percent from 2008 to 2013, according to a BioTalent Canada study. Correcting this imbalance is a priority for BioTalent Canada, said Rob Henderson, the organization's president and CEO. Tapping into the US-based Women in Bio network is a natural means to this end. Women in Bio was launched in 2002 in Washington, D.C. The group has since expanded to 11 chapters, and has taken on broader roles in education and networking. Last year, Women in Bio hosted more than 100 events with more than 4,000 participants. The all-volun-teer organization helps women in the life sciences support one another's success. Members come from a wide range of fields, includ-ing government, academia and law, as well as the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Building on this model, the gov- ernment agency Status of Women Canada and the national nonprofit BioTalent Canada aim to expand op-portunities for women in the coun-try's bio-economy. Although women in Canada are pursuing higher education in the sciences in record numbers, they still face formidable odds when it comes to hiring, lead-ership and career advancement in the life science industries. As part of an initiative to recruit and promote women in non-tradi-tional industries, Status of Women Canada will provide US$231,000 to BioTalent Canada over three years. The funds will bolster the existing Greater Montreal chapter of Women in Bio and help to establish three new chapters in Toronto, Vancouver and Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. K. Kellie Leitch, Canada's Minister of Labour and Minister of Status of Women, announced the partnership on March 3, 2014, at a breakfast in Vancouver . Establishing a permanent, mean- ingful mentorship program to boost the careers of young women is a key part of the initiative. \"By seeing and having mentors in the full capacity of the word\u2014sponsors in addition to role models\u2014we hope to be able to reverse some of those statistics,\" said Carmela DeLuca, co-chair of the Greater Montreal chapter of Women in Bio. \"We continue to try to break the glass ceiling which still exists in corporate and academic areas,\" added co-chair Marilyn Krelenbaum. In addition, the Young Women in Bio program encourages girls' interest in science, particularly in high school, when their enthusiasm and confidence in the sciences have been shown to wane. The Mon-treal chapter recently sponsored lab tours and discussions about careers in science at McGill Univer-sity's Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Research Centre. DeLuca believes the mission of Women in Bio aligns with the goals of Status of Women Canada: \"There are lots of challenges in the life sci-ences, and I think the government recognizes that there's a benefit to having a diverse set of opinions and viewpoints to address those prob-lems.\" from Mannan Mannan binds surface receptors delivery of antigen & TLR agonists+ TLR 7 signaling endosome presentation to killer T cells (CD8+)presentation to helper T cells (CD4+)dendritic cellSTAR TREATMENT A skin serum made from barley seeds sparks celebrity buzz With celebrity endorsers like Martha Stewart and Cameron Diaz gushing over their facial serum, Iceland-based Sif Cos-metics is sitting pretty.

They saw an unmet need within the burgeoning stem cell research indus-try for growth factors and cytokines grown free of possible cross contamina- tion with bacterial toxins. With expertise in plant cell culture, they decided to invest in barley. Back in 2001, decid- ing to try to coax barley plants to package human growth factors into their seeds was seen as a big risk. It's a very difficult system from the stand-point of plant tissue culture and genetic engi-neering, \u00d6rvar says. \"But barley has so many good qualities as a protein pro-ducer that we decided to take that chance. Iceland-ers are risk takers.\" The risk paid off in 2005, when company scientists purified the first growth factors free of bacterial toxins and animal byproducts from barley seeds. Today the company supplies more than 20 growth factors and cyto-kines to over 400 labora-tories worldwide. But in 2006, the re- search team had their eu-reka moment when they realized that some of the growth factors that they produce are highly sought after as anti-aging agents for use in cosmetics. After some market research, they decided to spin out a subsidiary to market a skincare product line, and BIOEFFECT was born.

A SCIENTIST AT SIF COSMETICS INSPECTS BARLEY . F_Profiles.indd 77 5/30/14 1:02 PM78 INDIA \\ INDONESIA \\ ISRAEL A FUNGAL AFFECTION A love of fungi grows into a collaboration spanning decades and continentsOn first consid- eration, Mexico and India seem to have little in common. But despite their cul-tural differences, they do share several funda-mental traits, including significant poverty levels, a number of shared agricultural products and a common latitude of 20 degrees. It's this last detail that led to a friendship between two scientists\u2014one from Mexico and one from India\u2014when they met at a conference in Italy 14 years ago.Because certain regions of these two coun-tries have very similar climates\u2014partly tropical and partly arid, but with rainy summers\u2014Mukund Deshpande, chief scien-tist and professor in the biochemical division of the National Chemical Labo-ratory, Pune, and Jose Ruiz-Herrera, investigator emeritus at Cinvestav, Mexico's Center for Research and Advanced Studies at the National Polytechnic Institute, found they had a lot to talk about. In discussing their countries' common prob-lems, they also discovered that they share a love of fungi. With the support of their science foundations, Mexico's Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CONACYT) and India's Department of Science and Technology, the scientists soon started working on a collabora-tive project, Ruiz-Herrera explains, the \"fungus Yarrowia lipolytica and its capacity to metabolize hydrocarbons.\" This two-lab endeavor spawned the first joint Mexico-India workshop on biotechnology, held FEEDING THE NEED In Indonesia, farmers look to biotech crops to feed a growing population With a population of over 240 million increasing at a rate of more than 1.4 percent per year, Indonesia is look-ing to boost agricultural production to avoid food scarcity. The urgency of boosting food production has been heightened in recent years by a series of both floods and droughts that have reduced yields of rice, the staple food of Indonesia. In response, the largest organization representing farmers in Indone-sia, Kontak Tani Nelayan Andalan (KTNA), has issued a call for speed-ing the implementation of agricul-tural biotechnology to help offset a changing climate's effect on crops. KTNA's current chair, Winarno Tohir, has warned that if farmers aren't given the tools to improve yield, Indonesia will become a net importer of most agricultural crops. The group calls for accel-erated movement to drought-, flood- and pest-resistant varieties. Although Indonesia has been slow to adopt agricultural biotechnology, recent trends suggest that attitudes are shifting. Since the formation of the Na- tional Genetically Modified Product Biosafety Commission (KKHPRG) in 2010, steps have been taken toward field-testing genetically modified crops. A growing preference for locally made tempeh and tofu has expanded the market for soybeans, but the country meets that demand mainly by imports. However, use of herbicide-tolerant soybeans is expected to boost domestic produc-tion. Likewise, drought-tolerant sugarcane\u2014developed in 2013 by the state plantation PT Perkebunan Nusantara, the Indonesian Sugar-cane Plantation Research Center and the State University of Jember in East Java\u2014is currently in field-testing. Indonesia also has active re- search programs developing crops such as stem-borer-resistant rice, rot-disease-resistant potato and virus-resistant tomato. There is a widening acceptance of crops modi-fied to better adapt to the changing environment, but even those advo-cating its implementation temper enthusiasm with a call for assur-ances that farmers will benefit. A frequent speaker on issues of food security in Indonesia, Masy-huri, professor of agribusiness and agricultural economics at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, says that while the pros and cons of genetically modi-fied crops are still being debated, the majority of people, including farmers, is simply not aware of them. Masyhuri, who heads the university's Center for World Trade Studies, sees a role for agricultural extension agents in educating rural farmers and delivering advanced technology to help them gain ac-cess to world markets for their products. He says organized farm groups should have a voice in decid - ing how to stay viable and increase production. \"Farmers can adopt biotechnology as long as there are proofs that the biotechnology has benefit to farmers in increased pro-duction and income,\" he from Mannan Mannan binds surface receptors delivery of antigen & TLR agonists+ TLR 7 signaling endosome presentation to killer T cells (CD8+)presentation to helper T cells (CD4+)dendritic cell F_Profiles.indd 78 5/30/14 1:08 PMCOUNTRY SPOTLIGHTS 79 As news of the event spread, the doors were opened to all comers.COURTESY OF UNIQURE BVSTIMULUS PACKAGE Turning stem cells into molecular mediators to initiate repair After a 40-year career at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovat, Israel, it was time for Michel Revel to retire. Instead, Revel, an internationally renowned biochemist and molecular geneticist who was 72 years old at the time, got down to business. En-listing the help of five former Weizmann colleagues, he co-founded Kadimastem, a drug screening and regen-erative medicine company, in late 2009, with investor Yossi Ben-Yossef. Using proprietary technology, Kadimastem is work- ing on potential treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and types 1 and 2 diabetes. Revel and his colleagues have developed a technique for transforming human pluripotent stem cells\u2014cells with the ability to become any other kind of cell\u2014into insulin-secreting cells, as well as a range of neural cells. For Revel, the chief scientist of the team that created Rebif, Merck Serono's blockbuster MS drug, these latest efforts are a logical continuation of his work in the field. Indeed, they may even hold the potential for another blockbuster, considering that MS drugs generate US$10 billion a year, and just 1 percent of the diabetes market would exceed US$1 billion. \"All treatments for MS today, including Rebif, work by reducing autoimmune attacks, thereby slowing down the destruction of myelin, a coating that protects nerve in October 2013 in Pune, sponsored by the same foundations that had sup-ported the research on Y. lipolytica. The 200-person guest list included scien-tists, teachers and stu-dents, but as news about the event spread, says Ruiz-Herrera, the doors were opened to all comers. Deshpande and Ruiz-Herrera divided the sessions into three categories: agricultural, medical and industrial. In the agricultural segment, the scientists discussed new ways to obtain plants that resist infection from different pathogens; bioremediation; improv-ing crop productivity and other topics. In the medi-cal section, the subjects included using bacterial toxins to control insect vectors that cause human diseases and the impor-tance of protein glycosyl-ation in diabetes. In the industrial sessions, the discussions explored the production of enzymes and biofuels, eliminating contaminants from soil, removing toxins from foods and other areas of mutual interest. In addition to these conversations, the event included poster presen-tations by students and investigators from Mexico and India. At the end of the workshop, the attend-ees also discussed how to transfer what's learned in the lab to the outside world. \"One of the main problems is convincing people of the benefits of transgenic plants and microorganisms, and the important products obtained by this technol-ogy,\" Ruiz-Herrera says. Deshpande and Ruiz- Herrera also edited a 29-chapter book, Biotech-nology: Beyond Borders.It provides broad reviews of the workshop's topics, written by the meeting's attendees and others. The overall outcome of this collaboration has pleased Deshpande, and he expects more workshops ahead, with the next one, he hopes, taking place by 2015. As he says, \"We don't want to lose focus.\" \u2014CHRISTINE BAHLS BIOTECH CROPS MIGHT ENHANCE THE DWINDLING RICE IN INDONESIA. \u00a9 SUPRI/REUTERS/CORBIS F_Profiles.indd 79 5/30/14 1:09 PM80 UNITED KINGDOM \\ ZIMBABWE CURATIVE CUTUP A new treatment that cuts down wound-healing time by cutting up bacteria's defenses This chap rang me up,\" recalls Simon Knapp, veterinary sur-geon in Wokingham, UK, whose clients include horses belonging to Queen Elizabeth II. That call in 2012 came from Frank Sams-Dodd, who produces a wound-healing product called SertaSil. Thinking back on the call, Knapp recounts, \"I said I would try it on a couple of horses to see how well it worked.\" SertaSil consists of two ingredients, silica and an inflam-mation-reducing enzyme called serratiopeptidase. Where applied, it increases blood supply and con-trols infection. According to Knapp, SertaSil is a keeper . At the moment, SertaSil, consid- ered a medical device, is approved for use in animals in 13 countries. Ultimately, Sams-Dodd would like to see it approved for the human market, and is in the process of applying for the Conformit\u00e9 Euro-p\u00e9enne (CE) marking. \"We are launching on the veteri- nary market to get the case studies and the best use of the product,\" says Sams-Dodd. He and his wife, Jeanette, own Willingsford, which manufactures SertaSil. Clinical data on SertaSil, as compared to the antibiotic gentax-ane and an iodine-based antiseptic, showed patients using the product required significantly shorter hos-pital stays. The 266 study partici-pants had various acute and chronic wounds: carbuncles, diabetic sores and injuries with necrosis and tis-sue penetration. Within just 1-5 days of applying the SertaSil, all of the wounds became \"clean\"\u2014de-fined as free of dead tissue, pus and fibrinogenous thickenings. The comparative treatments took twice as long. Moreover, the study data show that SertaSil caused no adverse events. SertaSil's story began in Ukraine, when three scientists\u2014Olga Bily-ayeva, Viacheslav Neshta and Alex-ander Golub\u2014discovered a better product to heal wounds trapped by a biofilm, a protective environment that bacteria create to keep out the immune system. The researchers knew that silica could absorb mois-ture and other bacterial toxins, but when they added the enzyme, Sams-Dodd explains, \"SertaSil cut up the biofilm,\" allowing the immune system to penetrate this barrier and attack the bacteria. \"SertaSil isn't doing anything to the bacteria. It just exposes it.\" Sams-Dodd knew the researchers from a prior business relationship, and he and his wife bought the rights to SertaSil. Willingsford, looking for angel and venture capital, found help in its own backyard\u2014a roughly US$400,000 grant from the UK's Technology Strategy Board. Mark Glover, the board's strategy and planning director, says the organiza-tion was created to help innovative companies. Willingsford, which applied for the funding, received the product development money based on an expert healthcare panel rec-ommendation. The National Health Service, Glover said, could use such a product. As for Knapp, he appreciates both the speed and effectiveness this innovative treatment offers his patients, royal and otherwise: \"Its simplicity is the beauty of it.\" \u2014CHRISTINE BAHLScells,\" Revel says. \"We want to take this further by finding treatments that stimulate the body to repair the myelin coating. Pluripotent stem cells are very useful for this.\" While at Weizmann, Revel and his colleagues had already devised a procedure to differentiate human embryonic stem cells into myelin-forming oligoden-drocytes very similar to those in the human brain. \"We mimic these cells better than most, I think,\" he says. Now his team has worked out a robust protocol to pro-duce these human myelinating cells and use them as a drug-screening platform, based on functional human tissue rather than on rodent cells. Kadimastem, in contract with Merck Serono, is using these human myelin-forming cells to look for chemical compounds that fuel the differentiation of such cells. \"We have semi-high throughput systems with robots that can handle compounds, and a comput-erized microscope to analyze images and quantify re-sults,\" Revel says. \"We have already found four classes of compounds that stimulate myelin formation.\" On the regenerative medicine front, Kadimastem aims to improve diabetes treatment using insulin-producing cells derived from pluripotent stem cells. Designed for patients with types 1 and 2 diabetes who require daily insulin injections, this technique would involve implanting patients with the insulin-secreting cells to eliminate the need for injections. The chal-lenge for Revel and his team is in getting the stem cells to mature into functional cells that sense the amount of glucose in the blood and secrete insulin accordingly. If they succeed, they plan to encapsulate these differentiat - ed cells in a device that could be implanted, for example, beneath the skin. Their hope is that this will save patients from years of insulin injections. \u2014SHAILAJA from Mannan Mannan binds surface receptors delivery of antigen & TLR agonists+ TLR 7 signaling endosome presentation to killer T cells (CD8+)presentation to helper T cells (CD4+)dendritic cell F_Profiles.indd 80 5/30/14 1:20 PMCOUNTRY SPOTLIGHTS 81 SOWING SUPPORT Zimbabwean farmers look to biotech to boost the homegrown harvest Not all agricultural biotechnology is about geneti- cally modified (GM) crops, and GM foods are not the devil in disguise. This is the message that Jona-than Mufandaedza, chief executive officer of the National Biotechnology Authority of Zimbabwe (NBA), would like to com-municate to the country's farmers, consumers and government. Last year Zimbabwe, once the breadbasket of southern Africa, im-ported a million tons of grain after poor rainfall, among other things, led to an abysmal harvest. In-creased awareness of bio-technology, Mufandaedza believes, has the potential to avoid such a situation and drastically improve agricultural productivity. Although Zimbabwe has a moratorium on pro-ducing GM crops, it allows the import of GM grain, which comprised most of the country's imports last year . \"That is slightly cra-zy,\" says Ian Robertson, an NBA board member and a former agriculture professor at the University of Zimbabwe, describing the schizophrenic agricul-tural policy that confuses farmers about biotech-nology issues. He should know. After all, it was his company, Agri-Biotech, that in 2004 produced a \"virus-eliminated\" sweet potato\u2014using a non-GM tissue culture process\u2014that raised potential yields eight times per hectare. \"Tissue culture is very much biotech and more people need to be aware of it,\" he says. And Zimbabwe isn't even doing the obvi-ous, like using relatively cheap non-GM biotech-nology processes that are already in the public domain, such as virus elimination and marker-assisted breeding. Nonetheless, non- GM processes like tissue culture aren't enough to achieve food security or unlock the huge potential for Zimbabwe's farm-ers. GM techniques could Last year Zimbabwe, once the breadbasket of southern Africa, imported a million tons of grain after poor rainfall, among other things, led to an abysmal harvest.FARMERS IN ZIMBABWE SEEK TOOLS THAT INCREASE CROP YIELDS.reduce losses by fighting pests and diseases, says Robertson. For human diseases, Zimbabwe uses biotechnology-based med-icines, including anti-ret-rovirals and insulin. \"But it's rather strange that isn't the case in the agri-cultural sector . I've heard the wildest rumors\u2014that GM crops cause gonor-rhea, they cause cancer, practically everything,\" Robertson says. Zimbabwe has good breeders and farmers, says Robertson, and if they are allowed to genetically improve crops using public-domain GM genes, like the famous Bt gene for stem-borer re-sistance and the glypho-sate gene to help reduce weeds, the country can compete with GM im-ports. \"All you need are three PhDs for maize and three PhDs for cotton and we can do this by using tried-and-tested GM pro-cesses. But farmers need to be educated about this and government needs to invest in it,\" he says. Thanks now to the NBA and groups like the Open Forum on Agri-cultural Biotechnology, this kind of awareness is slowly rising. \"I have stories about farmers' groups who tell govern-ment committee mem-bers to stop talking only about the ills of GM and to tell them more about things like virus elimina-tion,\" Robertson says. \"That makes me How Nanobiophysics will Transform Global Healthcare system grows more complex, with highly specialized and overpriced re-ductionist silos that seek to cut costs by adopting a \"one size /f_i ts all\" men-tality. I believe that the solution to this problem will come from the new science of nanobiophysics. At Nanobiosym, we have been developing next-generation tech-nologies to disrupt the current cen-tralized healthcare paradigm. We have harnessed over 20 years of our work in nanobiophysics to develop Gene-RADAR, a mobile diagnostic platform for providing anyone, any-time, anywhere with instant access to personalized information about their health. By decentralizing the infra-structure needed to diagnose and manage disease, we are democratiz-ing access on a global scale, empow-ering individuals to take ownership of their health. What Google did for the information industry and what cell phones did for the telecommuni-cations industry, Nanobiosym is do-ing for healthcare. In the past two decades, we have experienced two profound techno-logical revolutions. Previously, ac-cess to information was con/f_i ned to certain centralized infrastructures like libraries, schools and centers of higher learning. With the Internet, Google disrupted the information industry by giving anyone, anytime, anywhere access to the world's infor-mation. Likewise, wireless technology democratized access to telecommuni-cations by leapfrogging traditional infrastructure requirements. As an Mobilizing, personalizing and decentralizing the next generation of infrastructure worldVIEWpoint he current global healthcare industry can trace its roots back to the Industrial Revolution. It was developed around the paradigm of central-ized infrastructure that many British factories of the time used. In fact, Westminster Hos-pital\u2014founded in London in 1719as one of the /f_i rst public hospitals in Britain\u2014serves as a prototype for how medicine is still practiced today. Cen-tralized hospitals and diagnostic labs have become the focal point around which our entire healthcare ecosys-tem and supply-chain alliances are organized. However, this model faces major limitations, as nearly 4 billion people worldwide lack access to basic healthcare. /T_h is includes both the de-veloping world and rural, remote areas (even in industrialized nations) where people do not have access to these nodes of concentrated healthcare in-frastructure. Furthermore, we face an impending multi-trillion-dollar crisis in the United States as our healthcare F_Profiles.indd 82 5/30/14 1:30 PMVIEWPOINT 83 example, India went from a few mil - lion landlines to over 800 million cell phones in about a decade. In both in - dustries, the adoption of next-genera - tion technology empowered individu - als and even entire nations and their economies to make a sudden quan - tum leap to the global stage. Health - care, as an industry, is still very cen - tralized and has yet to undergo this transformative level of disruption. TINY TECH, HUGE IMPACT Nanobiosym's portfolio of technolo - gies is poised to mobilize, personal - ize and decentralize the diagnosis of disease, and will ultimately render superfluous much of the landline-era infrastructure of traditional diagnos - tic labs and disrupt established sup - ply-chain alliances. At Nanobiosym, we are driven by the humanitarian mission to drastically reduce the cost of diagnosis with the aim of democ - ratizing access to real time diagnos - tic information to people worldwide, including empowering those 4 billion people who currently lack access to even basic healthcare. The gold standard in medical di - agnosis today is based on a 20-year-old Nobel Prize-winning technology called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which forms the basis of the multi-billion-dollar molecular diag - nostics industry and requires signifi - cant, costly infrastructure. Through the new science of nanobiophysics, we are creating next-generation tech - nologies like Gene-RADAR that will fundamentally transform how dis - eases are diagnosed and treated. We harness tiny molecular machines that read and write DNA to detect genetic fingerprints of various diseases. We have embedded these nanomachines and nanosensors in microelectro - mechanical systems and nanofluidic engineering platforms to enable real-time, mobile diagnosis. We are at a point in history where these nano - biophysics innovations, along with several recent technological advanc-es\u2014smart phones, information and communications technology, human genome sequencing, bioinformatics and so on\u2014are poised to complete - ly transform the delivery of global healthcare. The real-world consequences are profound. In the developed world, today's gold standard for testing HIV viral load costs US$200-300 dollars and can take 2-3 weeks to deliver a result. In sub-Saharan Africa, these tests can take up to six months, given the cost, lack of infrastructure and difficulty in transporting specimens for testing. The Gene-RADAR plat - form reduces that time to under an hour, with a price point 10-100 times more affordable\u2014all without the need for running water, constant electricity or highly trained personnel. But these are only the initial ways in which nanobiophysics will transform medi - cal diagnosis. Earlier, faster, more ac - curate detection of other infectious diseases also provides new hope for containing the spread of global pan - demics like Avian Flu and SARS, as well as for reducing multidrug-resis - tant strains of diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Technolo - gies like Gene-RADAR will also en - able the healthcare system to provide the right drug, for the right patient, at the right time, offering what we call \"personalized nanomedicine.\" ENGINEERING THE ECOSYSTEM Disruptive technologies alone are not enough to drive the revolution in global healthcare. We need an en - tire ecosystem of early adopters and change agents to pilot and integrate these next-generation technologies. Engineering the ecosystem is just as important as physics and nanotech - nology engineering. By replacing the hospital and centralized lab as the epicenter of healthcare delivery, nanobiophysics-enabled platforms like Gene-RADAR will put the pa - tient and consumer at the center of the healthcare ecosystem. Our nanobiophysics-based tech- nologies facilitate a quantum leap for developing countries that would oth - erwise have to invest billions in pro - viding roads, water, infrastructure, trained healthcare personnel, hos - pitals and labs just to be on par with developed nations. By becoming early adopters of mobile diagnostics plat - forms, these nations will transform healthcare delivery to their citizens. By empowering patients and consum - ers to take ownership of their health and wellness, we are making health - care more integrated and holistically centered around the individual. Our disruptive nanobiophysics technolo - gies, coupled with the right business models, will unleash a healthcare revolution\u2014transforming not just the infrastructure needed to deliver basic healthcare, but ultimately transform-ing the entire experience.

F_Profiles.indd 83 5/30/14 1:30 PMOn June 6th, 1944, Allied forces stormed the beaches of Nor-mandy, France, nally turning the tide of the deadliest war in history against the Axis powers and restoring hope for the Allied nations. Months later, in Novem- ber of 1944, Franklin D. Roosevelt took the rst steps in creating what would become the National Science Foundation to capitalize on this pioneering spirit inherent in the planning and execution of D-Day, to combat a more lethal foe, disease, and the causes of premature death: \"The fact that the annual deaths in this country from one or two diseases alone are far in excess of the total number of lives lost by us in battle during this war should make us conscious of the duty we owe future generations.\"Now , 70 years later, we have formed Human Longevity, Inc., with that same pioneering resolve in order to address the results of this enhanced focus on scienti c discovery by developing products that will solve the most urgent challenges emerging from the dramatic increase in life expectancy around the world. To many, this is an audacious goal. The increase in global life expectancy has been accompanied by an increase in the number of people with diseases ranging from autoimmune disorders, cancer, HIV and Alzheimer's, which to many appear to be insur-mountable obstacles. But where others see aging as an inevitable degradation of function, we believe that the same vivacity characteristic of youth can be maintained throughout a person's entire life. Since the early 1940s, the pace of medical in- novation has accelerated with an increasing velocity. In that time life expectancy has more than doubled in America and around the world, with emerging nations gaining years at twice the pace of Western nations. Since 1965, the increase in longevity in developing countries has increased income by nearly 400 percent. Most of these gains are due to the reduction in the number of deaths caused by infec-tious, respiratory and digestive diseases, congenital and perinatal conditions. Infants born prematurely, who once suffered devastating and often fatal condi-tions such as poor brain development and blindness, now live full and productive lives. So, it was no surprise that after we battled and greatly reduced the global incidence of infectious disease, demographers predicted that chronic ill-nesses (which have replaced acute infections as the leading source of morbidity and death) would impose a limit on how long we could live. Economists have predicted since the 1970s that an aging popula- tion would bankrupt us and suck resources from the economy if we didn't encourage people to die after an 'agreed upon' age such as 80. Y et, just the opposite has happened. People are aging with fewer disabilities. Sickness is being compressed into the nal years of life even as we live longer. We live more, love more, learn more and earn more. The phrase \"live long and prosper\" takes on a whole new meaning when one considers the bene -cial economic impacts of a healthier aged population.

Many people have characterized our venture as a sequencing or diagnostic business. However, the tools we will develop will be designed to attack the sources of premature death at the genomic and molecular level and can be used to preserve and enhance cognitive function, physical capacity and overall vitality. Craig recently noted that: \"Life is based on DNA software. We're a DNA software system, you change the DNA software, and you change the species. It's a remarkably simple concept, remarkably complex in its execution.\" Expanding on this Bob has added, \"Since our biologic software resides in the nucleus, one can view the contents of the cell as a type of processor for that software and the cell membrane as the keyboard, allowing for external inputs which ultimately influence the manner in which that code is read and compiled.\" The execution is, we believe, something that will work to reduce disability and disease. Our work in stem cells has shown that if you can identify and measure individual variation for specific markers of disease at a particular age, you can identify the fac-tors that predict the variability in the transformation of cells over one's lifetime. Then, using the DNA soft- ware, we can tailor treatments to the way in which each individual develops a disease. T o achieve this, we had to create a commercial venture. Some press accounts claim that we are engaging in 'big science' and will compete with other institutes that are creating their own sequencing centers. Nothing could be further from the truth.

We recognize that most discoveries are the result of small groups taking completely novel approaches and sharing their findings. The late Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg noted that inter-disciplinary effort and other innova-tions are discouraged and hard to sustain because in the US, support for science is too much tied to specific, pre-approved projects. Instead, we are going to identify the most creative people and give them the freedom to make their own affiliations, eliminating the need to reapply for federal grants and distancing ourselves from the existing system that rewards consensus and punishes entrepreneurship. All of us have ventured, failed and succeeded by seeking to answer scientific questions based in real world experience and offering solutions. We all took paths that were ridiculed and rejected by established scientific institutions. Craig sailed around the world in a boat considered too frail to make the journey.
