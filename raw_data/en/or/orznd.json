Did you know that meditation can help you cultivate your life force and bolster your energy levels? The more you meditate, the more aware you will become of the energy in your life. Some people know this as qi or prana. It is the life force energy that lives in all things and moves through the physical body. It is universal and allows you to experience strong, overall health. If you want to learn how to manage your own energy better, the best way is to get in touch with the healing intelligence that's already within you. Our bodies know how to heal and come into balance. We can tap into this restorative intelligence when we engage in meditation. Think of it as cultivating positive, clear energy that you can direct and manage throughout your day. To bolster your personal life force, you can practice energy healing such as aura healing or self-healing. When you work with energy healing to calm the body, it makes sitting in meditation much easier. In the video below, I share two energy management techniques that will bring greater clarity, focus and peacefulness to your sitting practice. You can practice these techniques 10 minutes before your sitting practice or before you go to bed at night for a deep, restful sleep. When you practice energy cultivation through meditation, pay attention to what you feel and notice. At first, you may not feel or sense much and that's perfectly OK. With time, you will become more attuned to the subtle, magnetic energy that moves through your physical body. The more you engage and become aware of healing energy and cultivation, the greater potential it has to deepen your personal practice. Try it at home for yourself and see if it makes a positive difference in your everyday life.
