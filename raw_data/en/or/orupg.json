Here's what you should know about integrative therapies for managing fibromyalgia. What is Fibromyalgia? As a chronic illness, fibromyalgia is long-lasting and causes widespread pain to your joints and muscles. Patients with fibromyalgia also experience: - unusual bouts of fatigue - numbness in the hands and feet - anxiety and depression - problems with focus and concentration - irritable bowel syndrome - trouble falling asleep Symptoms of fibromyalgia differ from one patient to the next. Some may also have a condition known as abnormal pain perception processing, where pain from injuries or other causes may be more pronounced than in people without it. What Are the Benefits of Integrated Treatments for Fibromyalgia? There are multiple benefits to undergoing an integrative approach to managing your symptoms of fibromyalgia. As we've already mentioned, each patient experiences fibromyalgia differently, and an individualized approach works best in maintaining your overall levels of wellness. Integrative medicine is typically non-invasive and does not involve the use of narcotics. An integrated approach looks at patients as a whole being, which, in addition to the physical, includes their spiritual and emotional bodies. Other common benefits may include: - Enhanced quality of life - Effective pain management - Improvements to focus and concentration - Decrease in stress and anxiety - Decrease in medication usage - Improvements to the quality of sleep What to Expect During an Integrated Fibromyalgia Therapy Session If you've never had an integrative fibromyalgia therapy session, you might be wondering what to expect during your first appointment. A certified physician at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin by asking detailed questions to determine your health history, taking into consideration your mental and emotional needs. From there, your doctor will prescribe one or several forms of therapies to help decrease the severity of your symptoms. Some common integrative approaches to managing fibromyalgia can include: - acupuncture - chiropractic adjustments - hydrotherapy - tai chi - transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) Effective fibromyalgia management requires accurate evaluation and prompt care using safe, effective integrative techniques.
