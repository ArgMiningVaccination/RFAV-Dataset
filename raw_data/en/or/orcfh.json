Despite this excessive expenditure, chronic diseases", "sitename": "Rupa Health", "date": "2023-03-23", "cleaned_text": "The United States spends the [highest](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/#GDP%20per%20capita%20and%20health%20consumption%20spending%20per%20capita,%202021%20(U.S.%20dollars,%20PPP%20adjusted)) per capita on healthcare globally, yet the country ranks [37th](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmp0910064) in healthcare outcomes among developed nations. Despite this excessive expenditure, chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes continue to rise, accounting for [86%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7077778/) of healthcare costs. In fact, [50%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7077778/) of Americans have at least one chronic disease. Traditional Western medicine has long focused on treating these diseases with pharmaceuticals and surgery. Thankfully, many medical professionals are now turning to [functional medicine](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/what-is-functional-medicine) as a more effective and sustainable approach. Functional medicine takes a proactive approach to healthcare by focusing on the root causes of disease rather than just treating symptoms. This approach offers a more sustainable path to long-term health and prevention. [signup] What is Functional Medicine? Functional medicine seeks to identify and address the underlying factors contributing to disease instead of treating a patient's symptoms. This approach can be likened to a detective investigating a crime scene, looking for clues to uncover the root cause of the crime. By taking a more holistic approach that considers a patient's environment, lifestyle, and genetics, functional medicine practitioners aim to treat the [whole](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/what-is-holistic-medicine) person rather than just managing symptoms with medication. Personalized care is at the heart of [functional](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/what-is-functional-medicine) medicine, with treatments tailored to each patient's unique needs, circumstances, and goals. This may include assessing genetics, diet, stress levels, and environmental exposures. By addressing the root causes of disease and customizing treatments to suit each, functional medicine offers a more comprehensive and practical approach to healthcare. Functional medicine practitioners also emphasize [optimal](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/how-functional-medicine-provider-look-at-optimal-lab-ranges) lab values, which can reveal meaningful patterns and markers that indicate potential disease progression. These values are more specific than the standard lab values used in conventional medicine. By catching warning signs early, functional medicine practitioners can intervene [before](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/subclinical-hypothyroidism-signs-symptoms-treatments) the disease progresses, potentially halting or reversing its course. This proactive approach to detecting and addressing disease sets functional medicine apart from traditional medical practices, making it a powerful tool for promoting long-term health and well-being. Why More Medical Professionals Are Moving Towards Functional Medicine Conventional medicine often focuses on treating symptoms rather than identifying and addressing the root causes of disease. This approach can effectively manage acute conditions but often falls short for chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and autoimmune disorders. On the other hand, functional medicine takes a root cause approach to healthcare. By understanding the underlying factors contributing to disease, such as environmental exposures, stress, and genetics, functional medicine practitioners can tailor treatments to each patient rather than just covering up symptoms with medication. This personalized approach can lead to better patient outcomes, fewer side effects, and a greater chance of long-term healing ( [4](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/what-is-functional-medicine), [5](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/introducing-rupa)). Functional medicine is based on the understanding that the body is a complex system with many interconnected parts. When one part of the system is out of balance, it can also lead to [dysfunction](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/wired-but-tired-this-isnt-a-normal-part-of-aging) in other areas. Rather than treating each symptom as a separate problem, functional medicine seeks to identify and address the underlying imbalances in the body that contribute to disease. By taking a [comprehensive](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/holistic-medicine-glossary-functional-integrative-naturopathic-more) approach that considers a patient's lifestyle, [diet](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2019/americans-poor-diet-drives-50-billion-year-health-care-costs), environment, and genetics, functional medicine practitioners can provide a more individualized and practical approach to healthcare. This can lead to better patient outcomes and a more sustainable and cost-effective healthcare system overall. What Types of Labs Do Functional Medicine Practitioners Commonly Use? Functional medicine practitioners are able to order various tests to help assess the root cause of many conditions and symptoms. Here are the most commonly ordered testing categories: Food and Chemical Sensitivity Testing Food and chemical sensitivity testing is a crucial aspect of functional medicine. It involves testing individuals for specific foods and chemicals that may be causing [inflammation](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/inflammatory-markers-101-what-do-they-mean) in their bodies, leading to various chronic conditions such as autoimmune disorders, digestive issues, skin problems, and respiratory conditions. By identifying and addressing these [sensitivities](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/the-complete-guide-to-food-sensitivity-and-intolerance-testing), functional medicine practitioners can help patients make targeted changes to their diets and environments, leading to improved health outcomes. The testing process typically involves blood or skin tests, and results are used to develop personalized treatment plans tailored to each patient's needs. While conventional medicine may overlook food and chemical sensitivities, functional medicine recognizes their importance and aims to address them proactively.
