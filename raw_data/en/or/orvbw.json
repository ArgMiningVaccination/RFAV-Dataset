Only you know your family's lifestyle, health, budget and benefit preferences. Here are some questions to ask yourself as you review the information on the following pages: What is the premium? What choice of providers do I have? Are the providers and facilities I currently use considered in- or out-of-network? Is the medicine I currently take covered? What is my share of the cost? What benefits are available for a catastrophic illness or injury? What will happen if I need care while away from home? Will the plan cover me if I stay out of the area for an extended period of time? Are my special needs covered? How often do I anticipate needing care? Is there a deductible? What is the annual out-of-pocket maximum? Are there any benefit limitations? How will Medicare affect my NYSHIP coverage? (See page 5 in this booklet for more information on Medicare.) Selecting a Health Insurance and Your Dependents Must Enroll in Medicare Parts A and 2023/RetireeA Message from The New York State Health Insurance Program (NYSHIP) NYSHIP provides comprehensive health benefits to retirees of New York State and Participating Employers that can help you and your families stay healthy and live well. Under NYSHIP, you may choose coverage under The Empire Plan or one of the NYSHIP-approved Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) in your area. Use this booklet to learn about the different plans and select one that best suits your needs. You may change your NYSHIP option once at any time during any 12-month period. For more information about a specific plan, call The Empire Plan or any of the HMOs directly. You can also call the Employee Benefits Division of the Department of Civil Service at 518-457-5754 or 1-800-833-4344 (United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands), Monday through Friday between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Eastern time. Note: NYSHIP does not offer an open enrollment period. If you and/or your dependents are eligible for NYSHIP coverage but are not enrolled, see your General Information Book for information regarding enrollment and situations in which a late enrollment waiting period applies. 1 Choices 2023/RetireeChanging Your Health Insurance Plan Consider your NYSHIP option carefully. You may change your health insurance plan only once in a 12-month period unless you add a new dependent to your coverage or move (under certain conditions). See your General Information Book for details. A change in the providers who participate in your plan is not a situation that allows you to change your NYSHIP option more than once in a 12-month period. Note: To enroll in an HMO or remain enrolled in your current HMO, you must live or work in the HMO's NYSHIP service area. If you are enrolled in an HMO and no longer qualify for that plan based on the live-or-work requirement, you must change your option. See the Plans by County pages and the individual HMO pages in this booklet for more information. If you decide to change your option: 1. Complete the NYSHIP Option Transfer Request Form on page 61. 2. Mail it to the Employee Benefits Division at the address on the form as early as possible prior to the coverage effective date you are requesting. (The effective date must be the first of a month.) 3. If you or your dependent is enrolled in Medicare and you change out of a NYSHIP Medicare Advantage Plan, you must also fill out the NYSHIP Medicare Advantage HMO Enrollment Cancellation Form on page 63 prior to the coverage effective date you are requesting. See page 62 for a list of Medicare Advantage options and instructions. NO ACTION IS REQUIRED IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR CURRENT HEALTH INSURANCE OPTION AND STILL QUALIFY FOR IT.New in 2023 for The Empire Plan For 2023, the maximum out-of-pocket limit for covered, in-network services under The Empire Plan is $9,100 for Individual coverage and $18,200 for Family coverage, split between the Hospital, Medical/Surgical, Mental Health and Substance Use and Prescription Drug programs. See page 27 for more information about how out-of-pocket limits apply to each Empire Plan program. Through LiveHealth Online, enrollees can access board- certified doctors and licensed therapists 24 hours a day, seven days a week via smartphone, tablet or personal computer. Telemedicine visits through LiveHealth Online will continue to be covered by The Empire Plan at no cost.Reminders 2 Choices 2023/RetireeBenefit Cards You will receive your Empire Plan or HMO plan identification card(s) in the mail once your option transfer request has been processed. If you need medical services before your new card arrives and you need help verifying your new enrollment, contact the Employee Benefits Division (see page 4). If you and/or any of your dependents are Medicare primary and enrolled in The Empire Plan, each of you will also receive an Empire Plan Medicare Rx card from SilverScript (see pages 20-22). Each card will have a unique ID number, which will be used at network pharmacies specifically for that person's medications and account information. If you need to obtain prescription drugs before your new card arrives, call 1-877-769-7447 and press 4 for Empire Plan Medicare Rx for assistance. You and Your Dependents Must Enroll in Medicare Parts A and B When you and/or your dependents first become eligible for primary Medicare coverage (Medicare pays first, before NYSHIP), you must enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B, even if you are working for another employer. (If you are retired from New York State or a Participating Employer and return to work in a benefits-eligible position for the same employer, NYSHIP will provide primary coverage for you and your Medicare-eligible covered dependents while you are on the payroll.* Note: New York State is considered the same employer regardless of which agency or branch hires you.) If you have Family coverage, each of your covered dependents must also be enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B when they are first eligible for Medicare coverage that is primary to NYSHIP. * Medicare will continue to provide primary coverage for an enrolled domestic partner aged 65 or over. 3 Choices 2023/RetireeIf you or your dependents are not enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B when first eligible for Medicare-primary coverage, The Empire Plan or HMO will not provide benefits for services Medicare would have paid if you or your dependent had enrolled.** To enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, you must contact your local Social Security office three months before you or your dependent turns age 65. You must have Medicare coverage in effect on the first day of the month in which you or your dependent turns 65. (Or, if your birthday falls on the first of the month, you must have your Medicare coverage in effect on the first day of the month preceding the month in which you turn 65.) If you or a dependent becomes eligible for primary Medicare coverage before age 65 because of disability or end-stage renal disease (coordination period applies), you or your dependent must enroll in Medicare Parts A and B as soon as eligible and send a copy of the Medicare card to the Employee Benefits Division (EBD). See Medicare & NYSHIP, your General Information Book (both available on NYSHIP Online) and pages 5-6 in this booklet for more information about enrolling in Medicare and how NYSHIP and Medicare work together. Note: If you are a COBRA enrollee, special provisions apply when you enroll in Medicare. Call EBD for information.When to Contact the Employee Benefits Division The Employee Benefits Division (EBD) is responsible for providing benefits assistance, processing transactions/enrollment record updates and answering questions. You may also contact EBD to request a copy of the General Information Book, Empire Plan Certificate, other plan documents or replacement benefit cards. Representatives are available Monday through Friday between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Eastern time and may be reached by calling 518-457-5754 or 1-800-833-4344 (United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands). You must notify EBD if your address changes or if changes in your family or marital status affect your coverage. To report an address or telephone number change, call EBD at the number listed above. If you are enrolled in MyNYSHIP, you may make these changes yourself online at www.cs.ny.gov/mynyship. All other changes in personal information must be submitted to EBD in writing, along with proof of the change (such as a copy of a driver's license, birth, marriage or death certificate), at the following address: New York State Department of Civil Service Employee Benefits Division Albany, New York 12239 Please make sure to sign the letter and include the last four digits of your Social Security number or your Empire Plan ID number, along with your telephone number (including area code). Deadlines may apply, so act promptly once you determine a change is needed. See your General Information Book for details. ** If you are asked to pay a Medicare Part A premium, contact the Employee Benefits Division for more information. 4 Choices 2023/RetireeNYSHIP requires you and your dependents to be enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B when first eligible for Medicare coverage that pays primary to NYSHIP. If you or a dependent are eligible for but don't enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, The Empire Plan or HMO will not provide benefits for services Medicare would have paid if you or your dependent had enrolled. The Empire Plan and all HMOs offered under NYSHIP provide broad coverage for Medicare- primary enrollees and their dependents, but there are important differences among plans. The Empire Plan The Empire Plan coordinates benefits with Medicare Parts A and B. See your General Information Book and Empire Plan Certificate for details. Because Medicare does not provide coverage outside of the United States, The Empire Plan pays primary for covered services received outside of the United States. Medicare-primary retirees and dependents covered under The Empire Plan are enrolled automatically in Empire Plan Medicare Rx, a Medicare Part D prescription drug program with expanded coverage designed specifically for NYSHIP. If you are subject to a separate Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA) or late enrollment penalty by Medicare for Part D coverage, the State will not reimburse you for that charge. See page 6 and the Empire Plan Medicare Rx Evidence of Coverage (available from SilverScript) for more information. NYSHIP Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) If you are Medicare primary and enroll in a NYSHIP HMO's Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C), you replace your original Medicare coverage with benefits offered by the Medicare Advantage Plan. The plan also includes Medicare Part D prescription drug benefits. If you are subject to a separate IRMAA or late enrollment penalty by Medicare for Part D coverage, the State will not reimburse you for that charge. To qualify for benefits, all medical care (except for emergency care) must be provided, arranged or authorized by the Medicare Advantage Plan.Note: If you or your covered dependents become Medicare primary while enrolled in a NYSHIP HMO, you or your covered dependents will be automatically enrolled in your HMO's Medicare Advantage Plan. If you are not already enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B at that time, however, your NYSHIP coverage will be canceled. See Medicare & NYSHIP for additional information. Check with your HMO about benefits when you travel outside of your HMO's service area or outside of the United States. Non-NYSHIP Plans You may receive information from Medicare and from non-NYSHIP plans in your area describing Medicare options available to you that are not part of NYSHIP and wonder whether you should join one of these plans. Please keep in mind that Medicare allows enrollment in only one Medicare product at a time. Therefore, enrolling in a Medicare Advantage Plan, a Medicare Part D plan or another Medicare product (including those in which you or your covered dependents may be enrolled through another employer) in addition to your NYSHIP coverage will result in the cancellation of your NYSHIP coverage. If you cancel your NYSHIP coverage to join a non-NYSHIP Medicare Advantage Plan: The State no longer reimburses you or your Medicare-eligible dependents for the Part B premium. If you wish to reenroll in NYSHIP, there may be a three-month waiting period. If you die while you are not enrolled in NYSHIP, your dependents will not be eligible for dependent survivor coverage. If you have questions about how your NYSHIP benefits will be affected, call the Employee Benefits Division at 518-457-5754 or 1-800-833-4344.Medicare & NYSHIP 5 Choices 2023/RetireeMedicare Part D Medicare Part D is the Medicare prescription drug benefit for Medicare-primary individuals. NYSHIP provides prescription drug benefits to you and your dependents under The Empire Plan or a NYSHIP HMO, but your coverage is coordinated differently depending upon your option and Medicare eligibility status: Empire Plan retirees and dependents who are not yet Medicare eligible receive their drug coverage under the Empire Plan Prescription Drug Program (see pages 19-20 for more information). Medicare-primary retirees and dependents covered under The Empire Plan are each enrolled automatically in Empire Plan Medicare Rx (see pages 20-22 for more information). Each Medicare- primary individual will receive a unique ID number and an Empire Plan Medicare Rx card to use at the pharmacy. Medicare-primary retirees and dependents covered under a NYSHIP HMO will be enrolled automatically in that HMO's Medicare Advantage Plan, which also includes Part D prescription drug coverage. Remember, if you enroll in a non-NYSHIP Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Part D plan in addition to your NYSHIP coverage, you will be automatically disenrolled from NYSHIP coverage. For example: If you are a Medicare-primary Empire Plan retiree with prescription drug coverage through Empire Plan Medicare Rx and then enroll in another Medicare Part D plan outside of NYSHIP, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will terminate your Empire Plan Medicare Rx coverage. Because you must be enrolled in Empire Plan Medicare Rx to maintain Empire Plan coverage, you and your covered dependents will lose all coverage under The Empire Plan. If you are enrolled in a NYSHIP HMO's Medicare Advantage Plan and then enroll in a Medicare Part D plan outside of NYSHIP, CMS will terminate your enrollment in the NYSHIP HMO. People with limited income may qualify for Medicare's Extra Help program, which helps cover prescription drug costs. If you qualify, Medicare could pay up to 75 percent or more of your Medicare Part D drug costs, including monthly prescription drug premiums and copayments. For information about Extra Help, contact: The Empire Plan at 1-877-7-NYSHIP (1-877-769-7447) (TTY 1-800-759-1089) and press 4 from the main menu for Empire Plan Medicare Rx. Your HMO plan, if you are enrolled in a NYSHIP HMO (see the individual HMO pages in this booklet for contact information). Your local Social Security office or www.ssa.gov. Your state Medicaid office. 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours per day, seven days per week (TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048). If you receive prescription drug coverage through a union Employee Benefit Fund, contact the Fund for information about Medicare Part D. Medicare Part B Premium and Reimbursement When Medicare is primary, NYSHIP reimburses you for the standard Medicare Part B premium (excluding any penalty for late enrollment) and any IRMAA you must pay for Part B, unless you receive reimbursement from another source or your Medicare premium is paid by another entity on your behalf. The standard Medicare Part B premium depends on your individual circumstances, such as when you first enrolled in Medicare Part B, whether you pay for it through a Social Security deduction or directly to CMS and whether you are subject to the IRMAA additional premium. The Social Security Administration will notify you of your Medicare Part B premium for 2023. If you are changing your health insurance plan: The correct deduction for your new health insurance plan, plus or minus any retroactive adjustment, will be reflected in your pension check or monthly bill. The date of the adjustment will depend on when your health insurance plan change request is received and processed by the Employee Benefits Division (EBD). You will receive information regarding your 2023 NYSHIP premiums from NYSHIP prior to the end of the year. If you have questions about your cost of coverage after reviewing this information, contact EBD (not the retirement system). Please see EBD contact information on page 4. 6 Choices 2023/Retiree2023 Health Plan Rates The 2023 health plan rates will be mailed to your home and posted on NYSHIP Online as soon as they have been approved. Lifetime Sick Leave Credit When you retired, you may have been entitled to convert your unused sick leave into a lifetime monthly credit that reduces your cost for health insurance for as long as you remain enrolled in NYSHIP. The amount of your monthly credit will remain the same throughout your lifetime. However, the balance you will pay for your health insurance premium may change each year. The most common reason for a change to the balance you pay would be a premium increase for your NYSHIP option for the new plan year. If your monthly credit is less than your health insurance premium, you pay the balance. When the retiree premium rises, the balance you must pay will also rise. To calculate the balance you will pay in calendar year 2023, subtract your monthly sick leave credit from the new monthly premium.Enrollees Who Pay the Employee Benefits Division Directly The 2023 rate for your current health insurance plan will be reflected in your December billing statement or pension check for your January coverage. If you are changing options, the date of the adjustment will depend on when your change request is received and processed by the Employee Benefits Division. If you are entitled to Medicare Part B reimbursement, your bill or pension will be credited for the standard Part B premium (see page 6). This will result in a reduced monthly bill amount if your NYSHIP plan premium exceeds your Medicare reimbursement or a quarterly refund if your monthly Medicare reimbursement exceeds your monthly NYSHIP premium amount.Paying For Coverage 7 Choices 2023/RetireeYour Notice of Change Document If you receive your pension by direct deposit, your retirement system will notify you of any deduction changes. Because you pay for your NYSHIP coverage via a deduction from your monthly pension, your deductions will change to reflect your health plan's 2023 premium. The Notice of Change document (for the direct deposit enrollee) shown below is from the New York State and Local Retirement System (NYSLRS). Note: If you receive your pension from another retirement system, your Notice of Change document will be different. SAMPLE 8 Choices 2023/RetireeThere are two types of health insurance plans available to you under NYSHIP: The Empire Plan and NYSHIP- approved Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs).

All calls are confidential. 2 If Medicare or another plan provides primary coverage, you receive network benefits for covered services at both network and non-network hospitals. 3 You are responsible for ensuring that MHSU Program certification is received for care obtained from a non-network practitioner or facility. 16 Choices 2023/RetireeEmpire Plan Cost Sharing Plan Providers Under The Empire Plan, benefits are available for covered services when you use a participating or nonparticipating provider. However, your share of the cost depends on whether the provider you use participates in the Plan. You receive the maximum plan benefits when you use participating providers. For more information, view Reporting On Network Benefits (available on NYSHIP Online or by contacting the Employee Benefits Division). If you use an Empire Plan participating provider or facility, you pay a copayment for certain services. Some services are covered at no cost to you. The provider or facility files the claim and is reimbursed by The Empire Plan. Even if there are no network providers in your area, you are guaranteed access to network benefits within the United States and its territories for the following services if you call The Empire Plan at 1-877-769-7447 beforehand to arrange care: Mental Health and Substance Use (MHSU) Program services Managed Physical Medicine Program (MPMP) services (physical therapy, chiropractic care and occupational therapy) Home Care Advocacy Program (HCAP) services (including durable medical equipment) If you use a nonparticipating provider or non-network facility, benefits for covered services are payable under the Basic Medical Program and are subject to a deductible and/or coinsurance. Annual Maximum Out-of-Pocket Limit There is a limit on the amount you are expected to pay out of pocket for in-network services and supplies during the plan year. Once you reach the limit, you will have no additional copayments. Please see page 27 for more information.Combined Annual Deductible For Medical/Surgical and MHSU Program services received from a nonparticipating provider or non- network facility, The Empire Plan has a combined annual deductible of $1,250 per enrollee, $1,250 per enrolled spouse/domestic partner and $1,250 per all dependent children combined that must be met before covered services under the Basic Medical Program and non-network expenses under both the HCAP and MHSU Programs can be reimbursed. The Managed Physical Medicine Program has a separate deductible ($250 per enrollee, $250 per enrolled spouse/domestic partner and $250 per all dependent children combined) that is not included in the combined annual deductible. After the combined annual deductible has been met, The Empire Plan considers 80 percent of the usual and customary charge for the Basic Medical Program and non-network practitioner services for the MHSU Program, 50 percent of the network allowance for covered services for non-network HCAP services and 90 percent of the billed charges for covered services for non-network approved facility services for the MHSU Program. You are responsible for the remaining 20 percent coinsurance and all charges in excess of the usual and customary charge for Basic Medical Program and non-network practitioner services, 10 percent for non-network MHSU-approved facility services and the remaining 50 percent of the network allowance for covered, non-network HCAP services. Combined Annual Coinsurance Maximum The Empire Plan has a combined annual coinsurance maximum of $3,750 per enrollee, $3,750 per enrolled spouse/domestic partner and $3,750 per all dependent children combined that must be met before covered services under the Basic Medical Program and non-network expenses under the Hospital and MHSU Programs will be fully reimbursed. After you reach the combined annual coinsurance maximum, you will be reimbursed up to 100 percent of covered charges under the Hospital Program and 100 percent of the usual and customary charges for services covered under the Basic Medical Program and MHSU Program. 17 Choices 2023/RetireeYou are responsible for paying the provider and will be reimbursed by the Plan for covered charges. You are also responsible for paying all charges in excess of the usual and customary charge. The combined annual coinsurance maximum will be shared among the Basic Medical Program and non-network coverage under the Hospital Program and MHSU Program. The Managed Physical Medicine Program and HCAP do not have a coinsurance maximum. Basic Medical Provider Discount Program If you are Empire Plan primary, the Plan also includes a program to reduce your out-of-pocket costs when you use a nonparticipating provider. The Basic Medical Provider Discount Program offers discounts from certain physicians and providers who are not part of The Empire Plan participating provider network. These providers are part of the nationwide MultiPlan group, a provider organization contracted with UnitedHealthcare. Empire Plan Basic Medical Program provisions apply, and you must meet the combined annual deductible. Providers in the Basic Medical Provider Discount Program accept a discounted fee for covered services. Your 20 percent coinsurance is based on the lower of the discounted fee or the usual and customary charge. Under this Program, the provider submits your claims, and UnitedHealthcare pays The Empire Plan portion of the provider fee directly to the provider if the services qualify for the Basic Medical Provider Discount Program. Your explanation of benefits shows the discounted amount applied to billed charges. To find a provider in the Empire Plan Basic Medical Provider Discount Program, ask if the provider is an Empire Plan MultiPlan provider or call The Empire Plan, choose the Medical/Surgical Program and ask a representative for help. You can also find this information on NYSHIP Online.Medicare Crossover Program Under the Medicare Crossover Program for Medicare-primary Empire Plan enrollees and dependents with no other group coverage, Medicare processes your claim for medical/surgical, hospital and mental health/substance use expenses and then automatically submits it to The Empire Plan for secondary coverage. You rarely need to file claim forms, regardless of whether you use participating or nonparticipating providers. If you are a Medicare-primary Empire Plan enrollee or dependent, you are automatically enrolled in the Medicare Crossover Program but you may experience a delay in your enrollment while UnitedHealthcare and Medicare exchange your Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) and your secondary coverage information. You will know you are enrolled once you receive an explanation of Medicare benefits (EOMB) that states your claim has been forwarded to The Empire Plan. If the EOMB does not state that your claim was forwarded to The Empire Plan, you or your provider will have to submit a claim to The Empire Plan. If you are a Medicare- primary Empire Plan enrollee or dependent and are having problems with your claims, call The Empire Plan toll free at 1-877-7-NYSHIP (1-877-769-7447) and select the Medical/Surgical Program for assistance. 18 Choices 2023/Retiree* The Annual Maximum Out-of-Pocket Limit does not apply to Empire Plan Medicare Rx.Prescription Drug Coverage Retired Empire Plan enrollees and covered dependents who are not yet eligible for Medicare coverage that pays primary to NYSHIP receive prescription drug benefits under the Prescription Drug Program. Once an enrollee and/or dependent becomes Medicare-primary, they are automatically enrolled in and begin receiving benefits under Empire Plan Medicare Rx, a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. What You Pay Y ou pay the copayments shown below for prescriptions covered under either the Empire Plan Prescription Drug Program or Empire Plan Medicare Rx.

In almost all cases, you will not be reimbursed the total amount you paid for the prescription and your out-of-pocket expenses may exceed the usual copayment amount. To reduce your out-of-pocket expenses, use your Empire Plan Benefit Card or Medicare Rx Card whenever possible. Annual Maximum Out-of-Pocket Limit* There is a limit on the amount you are expected to pay out of pocket for covered prescription drugs received from a network pharmacy during the plan year. Once you reach the limit, you will have no additional copayments for prescription drugs. Please see page 27 for more information. 19 Choices 2023/RetireePrescription Drug Program for non-Medicare-primary retirees/dependents (see Empire Plan Medicare Rx Program section if you will become Medicare primary in 2023) Note: The Prescription Drug Program does not apply to those who have drug coverage through a union Employee Benefit Fund. A one-month supply of your medication covers up to 30 days, and a long-term supply covers up to 90 days. The Empire Plan Prescription Drug Program has a flexible formulary drug list for prescription drugs. Designed to provide enrollees and the Plan with the best value in prescription drug spending, the Advanced Flexible Formulary excludes coverage for certain brand-name and generic drugs that have no clinical advantage over other covered medications in the same therapeutic class. A copy of the 2023 Advanced Flexible Formulary will be mailed to your home with the 2023 At A Glance in December and is also available on NYSHIP Online. When you fill a prescription for a covered brand- name drug that has a generic equivalent, you pay the Level 3 or non-preferred copayment, plus the difference in cost between the brand-name drug and the generic equivalent (or \"ancillary charge\"), not to exceed the full retail cost of the drug, unless the brand-name drug has been placed on Level 1 of the Advanced Flexible Formulary. Exceptions apply. Prior authorization is required for certain drugs. A pharmacist is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to answer questions about your prescriptions. Certain covered drugs do not require a copayment when filled at a network pharmacy: Oral chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of cancer Medications used for emergency contraception and pregnancy termination Tamoxifen, raloxifene, anastrozole and exemestane when prescribed for the primary prevention of breast cancer Generic oral contraceptive drugs/devices or drugs/ devices without a generic equivalent (single-source brand-name drugs/devices) Certain preventive adult vaccines for non-Medicare- primary enrollees, when administered at a pharmacy that participates in the CVS Caremark National Vaccine NetworkSee the Empire Plan Certificate or contact the Plan for more information. Specialty Pharmacy Program CVS Caremark Specialty Pharmacy is the designated pharmacy for The Empire Plan Specialty Pharmacy Program. The Program provides enhanced services to individuals using specialty drugs (such as those used to treat complex conditions and those that require special handling, special administration or intensive patient monitoring), including disease and drug education; compliance, side effect and safety management; expedited, scheduled delivery of medications at no additional charge; refill reminder calls; and coordination of all necessary supplies (such as needles and syringes) applicable to the medication. Under the Program, you are covered for an initial 30-day fill of most specialty medications at a retail pharmacy, but all subsequent fills must be obtained through CVS Caremark Specialty Pharmacy. When CVS Caremark dispenses a specialty medication, the applicable mail service copayment is charged. The complete list of specialty drugs included in the Program is available on NYSHIP Online. To get started with CVS Caremark Specialty Pharmacy, request refills or speak to a specialty-trained pharmacist or nurse, call The Empire Plan, choose the Prescription Drug Program and ask to speak with Specialty Customer Care. Empire Plan Medicare Rx Program for Medicare-primary retirees/dependents Note: Empire Plan Medicare Rx does not apply to those who have drug coverage through a union Employee Benefit Fund. This is not a comprehensive description of benefits. See Evidence of Coverage (available from SilverScript), other plan documents or visit www.empireplanrxprogram.com for complete details. Empire Plan retirees and dependents who are Medicare primary on or after January 1, 2023 will be enrolled automatically in Empire Plan Medicare Rx. Each person will receive a unique ID number and Empire Plan Medicare Rx Card to use at the pharmacy. A one-month supply of your medication covers up to 30 days, and a long-term supply covers up to 90 days. The 2023 Empire Plan Medicare Rx formulary includes Medicare Part D covered drugs and a secondary list of additional (non-Part D) drugs that are covered as part of a supplemental benefit. 20 Choices 2023/RetireeThe Empire Plan Center of Excellence Programs The Center of Excellence for Cancer Program includes paid-in-full coverage for cancer-related services received through Cancer Resource Services (CRS). CRS is a nationwide network that includes many of the nation's leading cancer centers. The enhanced benefits, including a travel allowance within the United States, are available only when you are enrolled in the Program. Precertification is required. The Center of Excellence for Transplants Program provides paid- in-full coverage for services covered under the Program and performed at a qualified Center of Excellence or a BlueCross BlueShield Association's Blue Distinction Center for Transplants. The enhanced benefits, including a travel allowance within the United States, are available only when you are enrolled in the Program. Precertification is required. The Center of Excellence for Infertility Program is a select group of participating providers recognized as leaders in reproductive medical technology and infertility procedures. Benefits are paid in full, subject to the lifetime maximum benefit of $50,000 per covered individual. A travel allowance within the United States is available. Precertification is recommended. For details on the Empire Plan Centers of Excellence Programs, see the Empire Plan Certificate and Reporting On Center of Excellence Programs (available on NYSHIP Online) or call the Employee Benefits Division to request copies. If Empire Plan Medicare Rx excludes or limits your coverage of a Part D drug that you take, you or your doctor can request a coverage determination or file an appeal to change a coverage decision. For information on the appeal process for drugs on the supplemental drug list that have coverage limitations, please call The Empire Plan. Prior authorization is required for certain drugs. Call The Empire Plan and press 4 to speak with a CVS Caremark customer care representative if you have questions. A Comprehensive Formulary, which indicates all drugs requiring prior authorization with \"PA,\" is available at www.empireplanrxprogram.com. Certain covered medications may have restrictions. You may be required to try a specific drug before Empire Plan Medicare Rx will cover the drug your doctor has prescribed. Or, in some cases, the quantity of a drug that can be dispensed may be limited. You or your doctor may also need to provide clinical information about your health to ensure your drug is covered correctly by Medicare. 21 Choices 2023/Retiree Prescriptions covered under Medicare Part B are covered under the Empire Plan Medical/Surgical benefit and are excluded from Empire Plan Medicare Rx. For example, Medicare covers certain oral chemotherapy drugs under your Part B benefit (not Part D). Because they are covered under Medicare first and the Empire Plan Medical/Surgical benefit second, the pharmacy should bill Medicare directly for all Part B medications. Most pharmacies already know which drugs each Medicare program covers. Once your true out-of-pocket (TrOOP) spending reaches $7,400 in 2023, catastrophic coverage begins and you pay the greater of a $4.15 copayment for generic drugs and a $10.35 copayment for brand- name drugs or five percent coinsurance, not to exceed your usual copayment. People with limited income may qualify for Medicare's Extra Help program, which helps cover their prescription drug costs (see page 6). Medicare only provides coverage to enrollees living in the United States and its territories (Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa). If your permanent residence is located outside the United States, you are not eligible for Medicare coverage. If you are enrolled in Empire Plan Medicare Rx and plan to move outside the United States, please contact the Employee Benefits Division before you relocate to help prevent a lapse in coverage. Specialty Pharmacy CVS Caremark Specialty Pharmacy is your Plan's specialty pharmacy. When CVS Caremark delivers a specialty or non-specialty medication by mail, the applicable mail service copayment is charged. Specialty drugs can be ordered through the Specialty Pharmacy Program using the CVS Caremark Mail Service Order Form. To request mail service forms or refills or to speak to a specialty-trained pharmacist or nurse, call The Empire Plan, choose the Prescription Drug Program and ask to speak with Specialty Customer Care. Reminder: Enrolling in another Medicare product in addition to your NYSHIP coverage will result in the cancellation of your NYSHIP coverage. 22 Choices 2023/RetireeCall The Empire Plan toll free at 1-877-7-NYSHIP (1-877-769-7447) and select the appropriate program.
