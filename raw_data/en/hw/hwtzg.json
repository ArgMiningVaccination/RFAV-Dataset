As per Ayurveda, every human is born with a unique Prakriti - the innate nature which is the manifestation of [Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/ayurvedic-doshas) present in different levels in your body. Thus, everyone has one or more dominant doshas which influences the psycho-physiological characteristics of an individual. To have a healthy state of mind, body and soul, you need to maintain proper balance of all the three doshas. Your diet has a significant role to play in [building a stronger immune system](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/how-to-boost-your-immune-system) by keeping the harmony of all three doshas in your body. However, not all the foods are meant for your Prakriti and body type.
