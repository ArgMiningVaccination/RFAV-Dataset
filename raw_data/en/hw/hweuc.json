Do you respect and appreciate food for its taste, purpose, pleasure, and unlimited options? Do you obsess over your next meal? Do you over-indulge in food or drink during times of celebration? Do you binge, purge, or emotionally eat when you're alone? Does food bring you shame, guilt, stress, or regret? Do you elevate food on an imaginary pedestal or exalt yourself for maintaining a strict or restricted diet? How we view food is just as important as the food we consume. A healthy diet is an outflow of a healthy relationship with food. Honor the body God has given you and take some time to evaluate, renew, or restore your relationship with food. 7. Practice Mindfulness Coinciding with maintaining healthy boundaries and a healthy relationship with food is the practice of mindfulness. Mindfulness is being present (physically, mentally, and emotionally), aware of your surroundings (including your personal weaknesses and the people you do life with), and actively responsive. Are you mindful about the food you're consuming? Do you tend to eat differently in different situations, like smoothies after spin class, a pint of ice cream after a stressful day, or skipping a meal when you're too busy to eat? Or do you eat certain foods around certain people, like salads with your girlfriends or hearty comfort food with your family? Mindfulness is an attribute to attain when honoring God in our diet because it activates accountability, responsibility, discipline, and appreciation. Mindfulness is also best practiced with consistency. As one of my fitness instructors once said, you cannot be both interested and inconsistent. If you want the results, you must put in the work. "}
