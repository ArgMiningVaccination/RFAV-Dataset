Strategies used to achieve this goal include monitoring for infectious diseases, detecting and investigating these diseases and providing disease prevention and control services. Members of this local, state and private medical \"team\" are in critical positions to deter potential public health threats due to communicable diseases. An effective surveillance system and prompt evaluation and response by the \"team\" are essential to the control of disease. The purpose of this manual is: 1. To be a reference for all health care providers at the time of a suspected case, a particular disease or condition, or at the time of an outbreak of a communicable disease to institute public health prevention and control measures. 2. To assure more rapid and appropriate responses to situations that present danger to high-risk populations or the population at large. 3. To standardize the reporting and investigation of communicable diseases throughout the state. 4. To clarify the roles of the public and local providers and to optimize the surveillance of a population when a communicable disease(s) occur. The book Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, Heymann, D., MD, Editor; Nineteenth Edition, 2008, (an official report of the American Public Health Association*) may also be consulted about disease investigation or follow-up. If there are questions for which this manual or the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual does not provide answers, please contact the Iowa Department of Public Health, Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology (CADE) anytime at (800) 362-2736 or (515) 242- 5935. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 Introduction I Introduction Purpose of Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting : Infectious diseases are a continuing threat to all people, regardless of age, gender, lifestyle, ethnic background, or socioeconomic status. They cause illness, suffering and even death, and place an enormous financial burden on society. Although modern advances have controlled some infectious diseases, new ones are constantly emerging. State public health officials rely on local public health agencies, healthcare providers, laboratories and other public health personnel to report the occurrence of notifiable diseases. Without such data, trends cannot be accurately monitored, unusual occurrences of diseases (such as outbreaks) might not be detected or appropriately responded to, and the effectiveness of control and prevention activities cannot be evaluated. The Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH), Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology (CADE) is placing increased emphasis on strengthening infectious disease surveillance and response. This reference manual is part of the IDPH focus on providing more training and technical assistance to local public health agencies and healthcare facilities. The purpose of this manual is to guide local public health agencies and healthcare providers through specific surveillance and reporting responsibilities for the diseases reportable to the IDPH. For more specific information on surveillance and reporting of reportable diseases, contact CADE (800) 362- 2736. The manual is arranged alphabetically by reportable disease, with each disease in its own chapter. While this manual is targeted to local public health agency personnel and infection preventionists, other healthcare professionals can also use the information to facilitate their understanding of communicable diseases. The private provider and laboratory responsibility in reporting and surveillance is a vital and collaborative piece in acquiring timely and accurate information for assuring healthy Iowa communities. The terms \"local public health agency\" and \"local health department\" are used interchangeably. \"You\" and \"your\" refers to the people/audience for whom this manual is intended, namely, personnel of local public health agencies and local health departments and infection preventionists from health care facilities. All information in this manual must be considered in light of newer information available after publication. The three-ring binder format of this manual allows for addition of new and updated material as they become available. The web based version of the manual will have the most current information. Organization The Iowa Department of Public Health is a division of state government. The Division of Acute Disease Prevention and Emergency Response, and the Division of Environmental Health and Bureau of Health Statistics are located within IDPH, and are housed at the Lucas State Office Building in Des Moines, Iowa. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 Introduction II The Iowa Reportable Disease Surveillance System A. What is surveillance? Disease surveillance is the regular collection, monitoring and analysis of data relevant for control and prevention of diseases. The data is used to define baseline levels of disease. By knowing the baseline, one may then identify unusual occurrences of disease. The purposes of infectious disease surveillance are to interrupt transmission of disease to susceptible persons and to reduce morbidity and mortality through: Timely reporting, Identification and investigation of individual cases and outbreaks, and Interpretation of investigative data and dissemination of findings Surveillance is often categorized into two types: \"active surveillance\" and \"passive surveillance.\" Active Surveillance: An active surveillance system is one in which public health officials regularly solicit disease reports. This is often accomplished by regularly (daily, weekly, bi- weekly) telephoning selected individuals and asking if specific diseases have been identified. The reports are generally solicited from health care providers, infection preventionists , laboratories, schools, minor emergency clinics, etc. This type of system has been shown to double the number of reports of some diseases. In the case of active surveillance, the organization receiving information takes direct action in collecting this information. This may occur through direct review of medical records, laboratory records, or screening of high-risk populations. Passive Surveillance: A passive surveillance system, such as Iowa has, is one in which reporting is left to individuals (i.e. physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, infection preventionists, laboratories, etc.). Passive surveillance is the most common type of surveillance used in state and local health departments. The two major limitations of this type of syste m have been under reporting and delayed reporting. Traditional reporting of diseases by healthcare providers and laboratories is considered passive surveillance. This means that the organization receiving the information waits for initial data on a case to be submitted. This usually leads to collection of additional information and the implementation of follow-up activities. An example of this would be when a local public health agency receives a report of invasive Neisseria meningitidis infection from a healthcare provider or facility and then initiates patient interview and contact tracing with recommendations on post-exposure prophylaxis. A sub- category of passive surveillance is \"enhanced passive surveillance.\" In this situation, the organization receiving data works closely with healthcare providers and laboratories that are most likely to report a particular disease or group of diseases and sets up systems to increase timeliness and completeness of reporting. Guide to Using the Specific Disease Format: The format chosen for describing the specific diseases is designed to make the information easy to read and to orient the reader with terminology specific for communicable disease investigation. The following information defines the headings used and provides helpful hints in interpreting the information included in the specific disease sections. Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 Introduction II Synonyms: Some disease names have changed over time, and some health professionals or laypersons may describe the disease by other terms. Agent: The specific pathogen that produces the disease. Whether the agent is bacteria, virus, fungus, parasite, or other organism, it is important to refer to it appropriately when conversing with health professionals or the public. If the agent is an insect (e.g., lice) producing an infestation, the appropriate terminology for the problem is infestation, not disease or infection. Reservoir: The normal habitats where the infectious agent can live, multiply, and reproduce. These habitats can include man, animals, or the environment. Mode of Transmission: The direct (person- to-person or animal- to-person) or indirect (through vehicles such as food or water, vectors, etc.) transfer of an infectious agent from a reservoir to a susceptible host. The reservoir and mode of transmission are integrally related and the specific information about them should direct the types of questions asked during the case investigation. Let's take the example of two enteric diseases, salmonellosis and shigellosis. The reservoir for Salmonella includes domestic and wild animals and man. The mode of transmission is most often by ingestion of contaminated food, but also may be by the fecal-oral route resulting from contact with infected animals or persons. Having this information, the case investigation to determine the source must include a complete food history and investigation of possible ways persons and animals could transmit the organism via their feces. For Shigella the only reservoir is man and the mode of transmission is the fecal-oral route. In this instance, the case investigation to determine the source centers only on the possible ways that a person(s) can transmit the organism via their feces. No history about animals is necessary. Incubation Period: The interval between exposure to an agent that results in infection and the appearance of the first symptom of illness. There will be a range (shortest - longest) and an average incubation period for each disease. When investigating the occurrence of a specific disease, the shortest and longest incubation periods should compose the time frame in question. For example, the incubation period for hepatitis A is 15-50 days, average 28-30. When interviewing the case, you should ask, \"In the 15-50 days (2-6 weeks) before you became ill . . .\" or preferably use specific dates. For example, if the person with hepatitis A had onset of symptoms on February 14, ask about specific exposures from January 1- 30. Period of Communicability: The time during which a person or animal with an infectious disease is a potential source of infection. Period of communicability is important when assessing the risk that the case under investigation may have transmitted his/her disease to others. For example, when investigating a case of hepatitis A, request the names of \"contacts\" in the 2 weeks prior to and 1 week after the onset of illness (the period of communicability for hepatitis A). Clinical Illness: The symptoms commonly associated with a particular disease. If specific laboratory testing is not completed, a good clinical history of signs (objective physical findings) and symptoms (experienced by the patient) are necessary to determine the likelihood of diseases for which follow-up would be indicated. Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 Introduction III Diagnosis: The use of scientific and skillful methods to establish the cause and nature of a person's disease. Cases may be grouped as follows: Confirmed: A person who has a laboratory-confirmed infection with a particular agent. The person may have clinical symptoms or the infection may be sub clinical (asymptomatic). Sub clinical disease can only be diagnosed by laboratory testing. Probable: A person with clinical symptoms of a disease (but no laboratory confirmation) who is a contact to a laboratory-confirmed case or is associated with a documented outbreak. The case is then epidemiologically linked. Suspect: (frank, apparent) A person with a clinical syndrome suggesting a particular disease. Epidemiologically, this refers to a case which is not (yet) either laboratory confirmed or epidemiologically linked. Prevention: Slowing or stopping the occurrence of disease. This may include direct intervention by the public health or educating the cases and contacts about the disease, how it is transmitted and how to prevent transmission. Glossary: A glossary of other pertinent terms can be found at the end of this manual. Investigation of Communicable Diseases: Not every disease reported requires a detailed follow-up. Diseases are to be reported by health care providers, laboratories, infection preventionists, school nurses, local health department personnel, and can be reported by private citizens. Confirmation : The first step taken before any action is initiated is to confirm the diagnosis (if at all possible). If the disease is being reported by a physician or infection preventionists , confirmation in most instances is obtained by requesting information on specific laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. When a disease that requires public health follow- up is reported by a private citizen, confirmation requires contact with the appropriate physician, laboratory, or both, and requesting specific test results used to make the diagnosis. If the diagnosis is a clinical diagnosis without laboratory confirmation, it is sometimes necessary to request a clinical history in order to determine if the illness is consistent with the diagnosis. If the symptoms are not consistent with the diagnosis, contact the Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology (CADE) at (800) 362-2736 for recommendations. Case Investigation: Case investigation involves determining possible sources of the person's infection, assessing the likelihood that the individual will transmit the infection to others, and providing education regarding prevention of further spread to the ill person and their contacts. This may lead to investigation of the possible source and/or other cases. Critical factors in any case investigation include: Timely response to the initial disease report . Investigation of diseases requiring follow-up should be initiated within 24 hours. Collection of appropriate data needed to make an accurate assessment . Prior to interviewing, review material related to the specific disease. Critical information to Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 Introduction IV consider when collecting data is the reservoir(s), incubation period, mode of transmission, period of communicability and appropriate control measures necessary for the disease. Follow-up of leads regarding a possible source of infection . Example: An adult with shigellosis reports his child had fever and diarrhea a few days earlier and the child attends a child care center. An appropriate response would be to visit the child care center to evaluate if other children in the center are, or have been, ill with fever and diarrhea. Intervening appropriately to interrupt transmission and prevent disease. Example: A patient with salmonellosis reports that she had eaten at a local food establishment with a large group and several members of the group had become ill with fever and diarrhea. While you are taking food histories on all ill persons, an environmental health specialist/sanitarian should be consulted to visit the food establishment to conduct an inspection, gather necessary information, and collect food samples if warranted. Accurate documentation of information obtained. Complete information regarding any case investigation should be recorded in a neat, organized manner and filed. Case investigations should either be filed in a communicable disease file (for example: Hepatitis A Cases - 1985) , in a patient file (by patient name) or entered into the Iowa Disease Surveillance System (IDSS), Iowa's secure web -based disease reporting system. If the patient file is used, a log of all case investigations performed in the county should be kept. The record should not only include information given to you about the case but also any recommendations, instructions and education that was provided to the case. Recording should be done as information is obtained or service given. Do not rely on your memor y. Legal Basis: Reporting of communicable diseases is required under Iowa Code Chapter 139A. These laws are implemented by regulation under Iowa Administrative Code Chapter 641.1 The purpose of these regulations is \"to list those diseases declared danger ous by the Iowa Department of Public Health, and to establish reporting, isolation, and quarantine requirements. This is intended for use by local public health agencies, hospitals, healthcare providers , laboratories, educational and recreational program health officials, food industry officials, and the public.\" Infectious diseases designated as a threat to the public health must be reported directly to the local public health agency and the Iowa Department of Public Health. The only exceptions to this are sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, which are reported directly to the IDPH. Local public health agencies or their designees are authorized to accept, investigate and submit reportable disease case information to IDPH, Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology (CADE). Reporting of Tuberculosis: Healthcare providers, laboratories, or local public health agencies who have knowledge of a case of confirmed tuberculosis (TB) or clinically suspected tuberculosis case shall notify the Tuberculosis Program within 24 hours. Upon receipt of such notice, the TB Program shall notify the local public health agency within 24 hours. This notice shall include the case name, date of birth, age, sex, case address, and provider name and provider phone number. For more information, local public health agencies should contact the Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 Introduction V TB Program directly at (515) 281- 7504. Reporting of HIV/AIDS: HIV and AIDS (as determined by a laboratory test diagnostic of HIV infection or AIDS) are reportable directly to the IDPH, HIV/AIDS Surveillance Program. Perinatal exposures to HIV (i.e., births to HIV-infected women) are also reportable, as are deaths of persons with HIV/AIDS. Reporting is to be done by healthcare providers, laboratories, and other officials using the HIV/AIDS Case Report Form developed and approved by the IDPH. Because information beyond what can be captured in the Iowa Disease Surveillance System is needed for HIV/AIDS reports, reporting through IDSS will prompt the HIV/AIDS Surveillance Office to send the initial reporter the case report form to complete reporting . Local public health agencies should contact the HIV/AIDS Surveillance Program directly at (515) 242- 5141 to obtain a case report form or if there are any questions regarding reporting of HIV/AIDS. Reporting of STDs: Cases of certain sexually transmitted diseases (STD), as determined by a clinical diagnosis and/or from laboratory evidence of an infection, are reportable directly to the IDPH, STD Prevention Program . Specifically, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, and Chlamydia are reportable. Reporting is accomplished by clinicians, laboratories and other officials designated by the IDPH using a form or format approved by the IDPH or by reporting through the Iowa Disease Surveillance System. When using IDSS to report STDs, providers should indicate any treatment provided in the NOTES tab because the follow-up form is closed from view due the partner services information located within it. Local public health agencies, clinicians and laboratories can contact the STD Prevention Program directly at (515) 281- 3031. Reportable sexually transmitted diseases include chlamydial infection, syphilis, and gonorrhea. Minors may give consent for STD prevention, tests, and treatment without parental consent or notification. Case investigation will be conducted by trained disease prevention specialists at the state or local level. Reporting and Case Investigation; State versus Local Role: CADE collaborates with local public health agencies and health care facilities in the investigation of cases of communicable disease and the implementation of appropriate control and prevention measures. The guidelines in this manual, as well as other referenced material, form the basis for local public health agency communicable disease reporting, investigation and control measures. When clusters or outbreaks of illness, potential bioterrorist agents, emerging infections or other serious threats to public health are identified, IDPH will provide technical assistance to local public health agencies. IDPH assistance may range from serving in a medical consulting capacity to direct management of the investigation, implementation of control and prevention measures, and initiating follow-up activities. In special situations, IDPH may request technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ( Note : Requests for CDC technical assistance must be made by the IDPH.) When an institution such as a healthcare facility or a school is the site of possible transmission, the infection preventionist of the healthcare facility or the school nurse is typically actively involved in the investigation and the application of control and prevention measures. Ideally decisions about control measures are made collectively by the IDPH, the local public health agency, and the infection preventionist (or equivalent) in the affected institution. However, IDPH and the local board of health working together have ultimate authority. Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 Introduction VI Timeliness of Reporting: Cases of diseases reportable to IDPH are reported to CADE. Certain diseases should be immediately reported by phone to the IDPH when a suspect or confirmed case is identified. Diseases that require immediate reporting should always be prioritized above other case investigations. In addition, any disease where a cluster exists or where there is a suspected cluster or outbreak of disease should be reported immediately and prioritized accordingly. Post investigation, the local public health agency can follow up with the official case rep ort form(s). All diseases that are not categorized as \"immediate\" should be reported as outlined in IAC 641.1 and investigated within a week and a completed case report form with appropriate laboratory test confirmation (if applicable for the disease) should be submitted preferably through the IDSS. Note: Local public health agencies (LPHA) are responsible for residents of their county. Reports of illness received for residents of other cities/towns outside of the county should be forwarded to CADE or the appropriate LPHA. The importance of timely reporting cannot be overemphasized. For example, if a local health authority holds reports of salmonella and only submits them once a month, a potential outbreak occurring across city/town limits may go unnoticed and uncontrolled. The Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology (CADE) has an epidemiologist available during normal business hours (515) 242-5935 or (800) 362-2736 to answer questions about case investigation and control measures. Surveillance information is available during normal business hours at (515) 281-6493 for questions about reporting requirements. For disease reporting please call the Disease Reporting Hotline at ( 800) 362-2736. A medical epidemiologist is also available during non-work hours and weekends for emergency situations e.g., if you receive several complaints and are concerned about a potential foodborne illness outbreak. All calls are returned promptly. Examples of top priorities include: Clusters of illness Diseases that require prompt administration of countermeasures to prevent further spread and/or to reduce morbidity and mortality ( e.g., rabies, hepatitis A, or meningococcal invasive disease) Diseases with high mortality rates ( e.g., eastern equine encephalitis) Suspect bioterrorist agents ( e.g., anthrax or smallpox) Diseases that are unusual in the infected individual's demographic group or within a geographic region Disease with a high potential for spread to others ( e.g., measles) Note : To help local public health agencies distinguish those diseases that pose a more serious public health threat, certain chapters have been flagged. These disease chapters have a box with the notation \"Report Immediately\" at the top of the first page. If you are unsure about which investigations to do first, or need technical assistance, contact the epidemiologist on-call at (800) 362- 2736. Confidentiality Confidentiality is a legal requirement. The information that public health officials collect is often personal. Success and cooperation lies in protecting an individual's right to privacy. It is important to realize that confidentiality concerns extend beyond the investigator. Clerical staff, Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 Introduction VII administrative staff, interns and local public health agency members who may be aware of personal information on a case should all be familiar with and mindful of the basic tenets of maintaining confidentiality. Only individuals who have a \"need to know\" should have access to sensitive records. During and after an investigation, only those individuals directly involved in interviewing a case or contacts and/or those directly involved in follow-up activities to control the spread of the disease, fall into the category of \"need to know.\" This category would normally not include general administrators, town officials, elected officials and others involved in town government who are not directly providing disease control services. Individuals assisting in general education to the public also have no need to know personally identifying information about a case. If you are unsure about whether it is appropriate to release information, do not release it! Check with a supervisor, the municipal attorney or legal advisor, or contact the Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology at (515) 242-5935 or (800) 362-2736 for advice. Make sure information is released only to people who are authorized to receive it. Do not be pressured into a hasty decision. Do not confirm an individual case unless you are certain it is appropriate to release that information. If you are unsure about who is requesting information, obtain confirmation of the requestor's identity before releasing information i.e., a signed consent form with documented identification such as a driver's license; for guardians, documentation of guardianship. Inappropriate release of data could pose a liability threat to your agency and/or municipality and possibly endanger affected individuals. It is important to realize that information may be shared between local public health officials, healthcare providers, and with IDPH during the course of a public health investigations and control activities. However, even in these instances \"need to know\" applies. Information on individual cases may be obtained from IDPH Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology (CADE) only by the responsible representative of a local public health authority involved in an investigation of the case, the person who is the case, the health care provider involved, or the individual's guardian or designee (with written informed consent). The IDPH strongly encourages local public health agencies to acquire a secure fax machine for the use of individuals involved in communicable disease reporting, investigation and control. This machine should be located in a secured area where disease control staff work and should not be accessible to the general public. Communicable disease control personnel's use of a fax machine shared by many personnel in town government presents a heightened risk for breach of confidentiality. Remember the type of information released cannot personally identify a case. What facts could be released can change with each situation. For example, demographic information such as age, race, sex, or zip code could or could not be used depending how large the outbreak is, and whether it can be traced back to an individual case. The rule remains that if released information can identify or be traced back to an individual case, the information should not be released. Local and state public health authorities have investigated cases of infectious disease and collected sensitive information for more than 100 years. These efforts would not be as successful if all personnel did not uphold the public's trust by maintaining strict confidentiality. Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 Introduction VIII Reporting by Clinicians: Throughout the country, reporting of diseases by clinicians is variable. Clinicians are more likely to report disease with high mortality or diseases spotlighted in local and national media. Some strategies to increase reporting by clinicians include: Education on the importance of reporting. Appropriate mechanisms for reporting. Identification of professional or support staff who work with clinicians and who are able to take on the responsibility for reporting of clinician-diagnosed reportable disease. Prioritization of reportable diseases that pose a more serious risk to public health. Note: Local public health agencies (LPHA) having difficulty obtaining information from clinicians should contact the Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology at (515) 242- 5935 for assistance. Also, sample letters outlining the roles and responsibilities of the local public health agency for use with healthcare providers and patients are available in disease specific chapters. An important strategy to improve reporting by healthcare providers is to develop better working relationships with those in your jurisdiction through education, provision of reports on public health activities and disease data, and by asking for their participation in timely public health initiatives. This includes such things pandemic influenza planning, or a bioterrorism response and/or surveillance planning for emerging infections. Healthcare providers do not always inform patients that a disease is reportable to local or state health departments. This may lead to distress in a patient when they are contacted for a case investigation. Healthcare provider education on this issue is a good strategy for LPHAs. The LPHA should ask when the test results and diagnoses were communicated to a patient. It is usually best to begin an investigation by contacting the reporting clinician. Laboratory Reporting: Laboratory results are often reported directly to the IDPH from laboratories. This has led to more timely disease reporting. IDPH sends these laboratory results to LPHAs for follow- up using the Iowa Disease Surveillance System (IDSS). Some laboratories batch their test results and submit them periodically, potentially leading to long delays in receipt and identification or confirmation of cases. IDPH is working to eliminate this situation through laboratory education and the implementation of electronic laboratory data transmission via IDSS. The University of Iowa State Hygienic Laboratory (SHL) reports directly into IDSS. As Important Points Regarding Confidentiality Everyone with access to case information is required to maintain confidentiality. Confidential information can be released only to those who \"need to know.\" Be certain of the identity of the person to whom you release confidential information. Insist on confirmation of identity e.g. copy of driver's license, if unsure. Maintain confidentiality during reporting. If reporting by fax, be certain that the receiving number is a confidential fax e.g., (515) 281 -5698 is the number of the Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology, Surveillance Program confidential fax. When receiving information by fax to your office, confidentiality also must be maintained. Personally identifying information from case report forms and other forms cannot be released without the individual's signed consent, except to those directly involved in case investigation, control and prevention who have a \"need to know.\" Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 Introduction IX time progresses IDPH will reach out to additional laboratories to initiate secure electronic data submission. Current laboratory systems often are not equipped to collect much of the information needed, nor are they linked directly to clinical/patient information systems. As hospital and laboratory databases become more integrated, better demographic information will become available. IDPH currently attempts to gather additional information when patient information is too limited to allow local public health agency follow-up. Sentinel Surveillance and Reporting of Selected Diseases: In addition to passive, enhanced passive and active surveillance, IDPH has several \"sentinel\" surveillance projects. The primary purpose of sentinel surveillance is the initial and/or representative detection of disease, whether it is emergent or recurrent. This requires that the organization receiving data work closely with a select number of sites, e.g., healthcare providers, laboratories, or school nurses , to supplement standard reporting. Sentinel surveillance reporting is particularly useful in providing warning of the arrival of a disease. For diseases that are high in volume and not individually reportable, such as influenza, it can also provide estimates about the burden of disease among the general population. Sentinel surveillance and reporting may also be helpful when monitoring a disease that is newly introduced to a population, such as West Nile virus, or when providing information about a disease disproportionately affecting specific populations, such as varicella surveillance in schools. Limitations of Data; Under-Reporting and Incomplete Data: Because most surveillance systems are based on a passive disease reporting, under-reporting is inevitable. It is estimated that, depending on the disease, only 5% to 80% of cases that actually occur will be reported. For example, foodborne illness is often underreported because individuals with disease do not consult a healthcare provider, or a diagnosis of \"gastrointestinal illness\" is made and treated without any diagnostic tests that might identify the particular pathogen. Even with incomplete information, it is often possible to detect key trends and/or sources of infection. For diseases that occur less frequently, the need for completeness becomes more important. Each individual case must be treated as a \"key\" event. Lack of Representativeness of Reported Cases: Health conditions are not reported randomly. For example, illnesses in a healthcare facility are reported more frequently than those diagnosed by outpatient care providers. A provider is more likely to report a case of hepatitis A if the patient is ill than if the patient has few or no symptoms. A case of meningitis is more likely to be reported than a case of chickenpox. Reporting bias can distort interpretation of disease data. Changing/Evolving Case Definitions: Different practitioners frequently use different case definitions for health problems. The more complex the disease syndrome, the greater the difficulty in reaching consensus on a case definition. With newly emerging diseases and as understanding progresses, case definitions are frequently adjusted to allow greater accuracy of diagnosis. Also, as new diagnostic tests are developed, case definitions sometimes change to incorporate these tests. Case definitions establish uniform criteria for disease reporting and are not definitive for diagnosis. The case definitions used by IDPH for disease reporting are put forth by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologist (CSTE) and are used nationwide for accurate comparison of disease burden across states. The case definitions can be found at: www.cdc.gov/osels/ph_surveillance/nndss/phs/infdis.htm#top Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 Introduction X Bioterrorism: Bioterrorism is the intentional use of disease agents to create fear, disrupt society or cause injuries and/or death. The use of biologic agents by terrorists may involve acts that are announced or otherwise immediately recognized. Alternatively, and considered to be more likely, would be the silent introduction of a biologic agent into the population that could take days to weeks before illness becomes apparent. Because some diseases caused by bioterrorism may initially resemble common infectious diseases, the detection of a bioterrorist event may be difficult. Local health departments should immediately notify the epidemiologist on-call for Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology at (800) 362- 2730 if any of the following are noticed: A cluster of illness that is unexplained after preliminary investigation One or more cases of disease in a community in which the disease does not normally occur Illness in an unusual geographic distribution e.g., patients all residing in one area possibly downwind of a point-location or in an unusual population or e.g., serious pneumonia among young adults. Local communities must lead the response to a bioterrorist event, or to any infectious disease emergency. Planning, exercising plans, and communication are important and will be most effective if a strong partnership among public health, first responders e.g., fire departments, emergency management, law enforcement, local health care providers and hospitals have been developed in advance. Conclusion: The best surveillance lies in collecting accurate and timely data, and in carefully and correctly interpreting the data. The interpretation should focus on elements that might lead to control and prevention of the condition. Investigators can use surveillance as a basis for appropriate public health actions. The results of such actions can be assessed for effectiveness. This manual is designed to give an overview of local public health agency responsibility for surveillance, reporting, control, and prevention of the diseases reportable to the Center of Acute Disease Epidemiology. As experience has proved, case investigation can vary greatly from setting to setting, and it is impossible to address all the questions and situations that may arise. The Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology is available at (515) 242-5935 to offer guidance and assistance as needed.

Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, if a care provider sustains an exposure from an individual while rendering health care services or other services, the individual to whom the care provider was exposed is deemed to consent to a test to determine if the individual has a contagious or infectious disease and is deemed to consent to notification of the care provider of the results of the test, upon submission of an exposure report by the care provider to the hospital or other person specified in this section to whom the individual is delivered by the care provider. The exposure report form may be incorporated into the Iowa prehospital care report, the Iowa prehospital advanced care report, or a similar report used by an ambulance, rescue, or first response service or law enforcement agency. b. The hospital or other person specified in this section to whom the individual is delivered shall conduct the test. If the individual is delivered by the care provider to an institution administered by the Iowa department of corrections, the test shall be conducted by the staff physician of the institution. If the individual is delivered by the care provider to a jail, the test shall be conducted by the attending physician of the jail or the county medical examiner. The sample and test results shall only be identified by a number and shall not otherwise identify the individual tested. c. A hospital, institutions administered by the department of corrections, and jails shall have written policies and procedures for notification of a care provider under this section. The policies and procedures shall include designation of a representative of the care provider to whom notification shall be provided and who shall, in turn, notify the care provider. The identity of the designated representative of the care provider shall not be revealed to the individual tested. The designated representative shall inform the hospital, institution administered by the department of corrections, or jail of those parties who received the notification, and following receipt of this information and upon request of the individual tested, the hospital, institution administered by the department Revision date 2008 Iowa Code Chapter 139A 9 of corrections, or jail shall inform the individual of the parties to whom notification was provided. d. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a care provider may transmit cautions regarding contagious or infectious disease information in the course of the care provider's duties over the police radio broadcasting system under chapter 693 or any other radio-based communications system if the information transmitted does not personally identify an individual. 2. If the individual tested is diagnosed or confirmed as having a contagious or infectious disease, the hospital or other person conducting the test shall notify the care provider or the designated representative of the care provider who shall then notify the care provider. 3. The notification to the care provider shall advise the care provider of possible exposure to a particular contagious or infectious disease and recommend that the care provider seek medical attention. The notification shall be provided as soon as is reasonably possible following determination that the individual has a contagious or infectious disease. The notification shall not include the name of the individual tested for the contagious or infectious disease unless the individual consents. If the care provider who sustained an exposure determines the identity of the individual diagnosed or confirmed as having a contagious or infectious disease, the identity of the individual shall be confidential information and shall not be disclosed by the care provider to any other person unless a specific written release is obtained from the individual diagnosed with or confirmed as having a contagious or infectious disease. 4. This section does not require or permit, unless otherwise provided, a hospital, health care provider, or other person to administer a test for the express purpose of determining the presence of a contagious or infectious disease, except that testing may be performed if the individual consents and if the requirements of this section are satisfied. 5. This section does not preclude a hospital or a health care provider from providing notification to a care provider under circumstances in which the hospital's or health care provider's policy provides for notification of the hospital's or health care provider's own employees of exposure to a contagious or infectious disease that is not life-threatening if the notice does not reveal a patient's name, unless the patient consents. 6. A hospital, health care provider, or other person participating in good faith in complying with provisions authorized or required under this section is immune from any liability, civil or criminal, which might otherwise be incurred or imposed. 7. A hospital's or health care provider's duty of notification under this section is not continuing but is limited to a diagnosis of a contagious or infectious disease made in the course of admission, care, and treatment following the rendering of health care services or other services to which notification under this section applies. 8. A hospital, health care provider, or other person who is authorized to perform a test under this section who performs the test in compliance with this section or who fails to perform the test authorized under this section, is immune from any liability, civil or criminal, which might otherwise be incurred or imposed. 9. A hospital, health care provider, or other person who is authorized to perform a test under this section has no duty to perform the test authorized. Revision date 2008 Iowa Code Chapter 139A 10 10. The department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A to administer this section. The department may determine by rule the contagious or infectious diseases for which testing is reasonable and appropriate and which may be administered under this section. 11. The employer of a care provider who sustained an exposure under this section shall pay the costs of testing for the individual who is the source of the exposure and of the testing of the care provider, if the exposure was sustained during the course of employment. However, the department shall pay the costs of testing for the individual who is the source of the significant exposure and of the testing of the care provider who renders direct aid without compensation. 139A.20 EXPOSING TO COMMUNICABLE DISEASE. A person who knowingly exposes another to a communicable disease or who knowingly subjects another to a child or other legally incapacitated person who has contracted a communicable disease, with the intent that another person contract the communicable disease, shall be liable for all resulting damages and shall be punished as provided in this chapter. 139A.21 REPORTABLE POISONINGS AND ILLNESSES -- EMERGENCY INFORMATION SYSTEM. 1. If the results of an examination by a public, private, or hospital clinical laboratory of a specimen from a person in Iowa yield evidence of or are reactive for a reportable poisoning or a reportable illness from a toxic agent, including methemoglobinemia, the results shall be reported to the department on forms prescribed by the department. If the laboratory is located in Iowa, the person in charge of the laboratory shall report the results.

Because IDPH is not a covered entity, many agencies and facilities in Iowa that are covered entities have questioned whether they can continue to disclose the protected health information of their patients or clients to the IDPH as they have in the past. The short answer is YES, such disclosures may continue to occur under HIPAA. First, HIPAA recognizes that if there is a statute or administrative rule that requires a specific disclosure of protected health information, a covere d entity must obey that law. (Section 164.512). Therefore, if there is another federal or state statute or administrative rule which requires a covered entity to disclose protected health information to the IDPH, the covered entity should follow that requirement. Many disclosures of PHI to IDPH are required by state laws , including Iowa Code chapters 135, 136A, 136B, 136C, 139A, 141A, 144, 147A, and 272C and the administrative rules that implement these chapters. These disclosures are legally required and must continue to be made as mandated by state law. Second, HIPAA allows a covered entity to disclose protected health inform ation to public health authorities for public health activities. (Section 164.512). HIPAA defines a public health authority as \"an agency or authority of the United States, a Stat e, a territory, a political subdivision of a State or territory, or an Indian tribe, or a person or entity acting under a grant of authority from or contract with such public agency, including the employees or agents of such public agency or its contractors or persons or entities to whom it has granted authority, that is responsible for public health matters as part of its official mandate.\" (Section 164.501) . The IDPH has such a mandate and, therefore, is a public health authority under HIPAA. The IDPH, in conjunction with the Iowa Attorney General's Office, has reviewed its programs and determined that protected health information being received by the Department from covered entities in Iowa is disclosed for public health acti vities. The disclosure of such information to IDPH is, therefore, unaffected by HIPAA and should continue in accordance with past practices. Because IDPH is a public health authority that is author ized to receive PHI under this provision, covered entities are not required to enter into a business associate agreement with IDPH in order for the exchange of protected health information to take place. Third, in some instances, the IDPH is a health oversight agency as defined by HIPAA. Under HIPAA, a \"health oversight agency\" is \"an agency or authority of the United States, a state, a territory, a political subdivision of a State or te rritory, or an Indian tribe, or a person or entity acting under a grant of authority from or contract with such pub lic agency, including the employees or agents of such public agency or its contractors or persons or entities to whom it has granted authority, that is authorized by law to oversee the health care system (whether public or private) or government programs in which health information is necessary to determine eligibility or compliance, or to enforce civil rights laws for which health information is relevant.\" HIPAA permits a covered entity to disclose protecte d health information to a health oversight agency for oversight activities authorized by law, including audits; civ il, administrative, or criminal investigations; inspections; licensu re or disciplinary actions; civil, administrative, or criminal proceedings or actions; or other activities necessary for appropriate oversight of: 1. The health care system (e.g. State insurance commissions, state health professional licensure agencies, Offices of Inspectors General of federal agencies, the Department of Justice, state Medicaid fraud control units, Defense Criminal Investigative Services, the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration, the HHS Office for Civil Rights, the FDA, data analysis to detect health care fraud) ; 2. Government benefit programs for which health information is relevant to beneficiary eligibility (e.g. SSA and Dept. of Education) ; 3. Entities subject to government regulatory programs for which health information is necessary for determining comp liance with program standards (e.g. Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the EPA; the FDS's oversight of food, drugs, biologics, devices, and other products pursuant to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act) ; or 4. Entities subject to civil rights laws for which health information is necessary for determining compliance (the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights enforcement activities, enforcement of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the EEOC's civil rights en forcement activities under titles I and V of the ADA) . (Section 164.512(d)). \"Overseeing the health care system,\" encompasses activities such as oversight of health care plans, oversight of health benefit plans; oversight of health care providers; oversight of health care and health care delivery; oversight activities that invo lve resolution of consumer complaints; oversight of pharmaceutical, medical products and devices, and dietary supplements; and a health oversight agency's analysis of trends in health care costs, quality, health care delivery, access to care, and health insurance coverage for health oversight purposes. Health oversight agencies may provide more than one type of health oversight. Such entities are considered health oversight agencies under the rule for any and all of the health oversight functions that they perform. The disclosure of protected he alth information to IDPH for these purposes is unaffected by HIPAA and should continue in accordance with past practices. Finally, local public health departments and local contractors which are covered entities may release protected health information to IDPH under the above-cited legal authority applicable to all covered entities. For example, certain statutes and rules require local public heal th departments and local contractors to disclose protected health information to IDPH. Further, as a health oversight agency a local health department is permit ted, and in most cases required , to disclose protected health information to IDPH. Disc losures of PHI by local public health departments and local contractors to IDPH do not require business associate agreements and are not prohibited or otherwise affected by HIPAA. Please call Janet Hoffman, Assist ant Attorney General, (515) 281-83 30 should you have additional questions regarding these issues.

IOWA CODE 139A.5 Iowa Department of Public Hea lth 321 East 12th Street Des Moines, IA 50319 -0075 QUARANTINE QUARANTINE Terry E. Branstad Kim Reynolds Governor Lt. Governor Mariannette Miller -Meeks, B.S.N., M.Ed., M.D. Director Facts about Quarantine and Iso lation Quarantine and isolation are public health measures used to prevent or control the spread of communicable diseases which present a risk of serious harm to the public. The Iowa Department of Public Health (Department ) and county boards of health (local boards) have the authority to impose quarantine and isolation in very limited circumstances to prevent the spread of certain diseases. Quarantine and isolation are used to protect the public by preventing exposure to i nfected persons or persons who may be infected. Here are some facts about quarantine and isolation you should know: The Department and local boards will impose quarantine or isolation only in the event of an outbreak of a \"quarantinable disease,\" which means a serious and unusual or novel disease such as cholera, diphtheria, measles, infectious tuberculosis, plague, SARS, smallpox, certain viral hemorrhagic fevers, and other diseases spread person to person which present a risk of serious harm to the pu blic's health. Quarantine means confining a person who has been exposed to a quarantinable disease to see if they become ill and infectious to others. Quarantine is imposed for a period of time equal to the longest incubation period of the disease, which could range from a couple of days to two weeks, depending on the disease. Isolation means confining a person who is actually infected with a quarantinable disease for the period of time that they are infectious to others, which could range from a cou ple of days to weeks, depending on the disease. Prior to imposing quarantine or isolation , the Department and local boards will request that an individual voluntarily confine him or herself to their private home. Only if a person refuses to voluntarily confine themselves will the Department or local boards consider mandatory quarantine or isolation. The Department and local boards are required by law to impose mandatory quarantine or isolation by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spr ead of the disease. Typically this means the exposed or infected person will be quarantined or isolated in their home. Only if a person refuses to comply with voluntary home confinement and refuses to comply with quarantine or isolation in their own home will the Department or a local board consider imposing quarantine or isolation to a facility. If a person is quarantined or isolated in a facility the Department or the local board will ensure that the person is confined to a safe and hygienic facility and that they have access to adequate food, medical care, and a means of communication with those outside the facility.

Recommended infection control practices include: 1. Hand hygiene; 2. Standard Precautions/Transmission-Based Precautions (Contact, Droplet, Airborne) 3. Respiratory hygiene Hand hygiene is the single most effective means of preventing the spread of all infections among hospital patients and personnel. When followed properly, each of these practices decreases the risk of spreading common respiratory pathogens Hand Hygiene Proper hand hygiene is the most effective way to prevent the spread of infection. Detailed hand hygiene information is available on the CDC website at www.cdc.gov/handhygiene . To properly wash and clean hands, the following procedure should be followed: Wash hands when they are visibly dirty or soiled with blood or other body fluids. Wash hands with either a non-antimicrobial soap or an antimicrobial soap and water. When washing hands with soap and water, wet hands first with water, apply to hands the amount of product recommended by the manufacturer, and rub hands together vigorously for at least 15 seconds, covering all surfaces of the hands and fingers. Rinse hands with water and dry thoroughly with a disposable towel or air dryer. Use a dry paper towel, if available to turn off the faucet. If hands are not visibly soiled, an alcohol-based hand rub or gel may be used in place of soap and water in most circumstances. When using an alcohol-based hand rub or gel, apply product to the palm of one hand and rub hands together, covering all surfaces of hands and fingers, until the hands are dry. Avoid wearing artificial fingernails when caring for patients at high risk for infection, and keep natural nail tips less than 1/4-inch long. Wear gloves when contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin could occur. Remove gloves after caring for a patient. Always perform hand hygiene after removing gloves. Do not wear the same pair of gloves for the care of more than one patient, and do not wash gloves between uses with different patients. Change gloves during patient care if moving from a contaminated body site to a clean body site. Standard Precautions The Standard Precautions/Transmission-Based Precautions system is designed to prevent the transmission of infectious agents. It requires the use of work practice controls and protective apparel for all contact with blood and body substances, but uses Airborne Infection Isolation, Droplet, and Contact Precautions for patients with diseases known to be transmitted in whole or in part by those routes. Standard Precautions include consistent and prudent preventive measures to be used at all times regardless of a patient's known infection status, and include: Iowa Department of Public Health Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 General Infection Control Measures2 Hand hygiene . Practice hand hygiene after touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, or contaminated items, whether or not gloves are worn. Wash hands immediately after gloves are removed, between patient contacts, and when otherwise indicated to avoid transfer of microorganisms to other patients or environments. Gloves. Wear gloves (clean, nonsterile gloves are adequate) when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, or contaminated items. Put on clean gloves just before touching mucous membranes and non-intact skin. Change gloves between tasks and procedures. Practice hand hygiene whenever gloves are removed. Mask, eye protection/face shield . Wear a mask and adequate eye protection (eyeglasses are not acceptable), or a face shield to protect mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth during procedures and patient care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions. Gown. Wear a gown (a clean, nonsterile gown is adequate) to protect skin and to prevent soiling of clothing during procedures and patient care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions. Carefully, remove a soiled gown as promptly as possible, to avoid contamination of personal clothing, and wash hands. Patient care equipment . Handle used patient care equipment soiled with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions in a manner that prevents skin and mucous membrane exposures, contamination of clothing, and transfer of microorganisms to one's self, othe r patients and the environment. Ensure that reusable equipment is not used for the care of another patient until it has been cleaned and sanitized appropriately. Ensure that single-use items are discarded properly. Contact Precautions In addition to Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions should be used for the care of patients known or suspected to have illnesses that could be spread by usual contact with an infected person, or by the contaminated environmental surfaces or patient care items in the room. Example of diseases/organisms requiring Contact Precautions include: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS): See \"SARS Infection Control\" section Parainfluenza virus Respiratory syncytial Varicella (chickenpox): Also requires Airborne Infection Isolation Herpes Zoster (disseminated or in the immunocompromised host): Also requires Airborne Infection Isolation Gown . Wear a gown when entering the room. Remove the gown before leaving the patient's environment. After gown removal, ensure that clothing does not contact potentially contaminated environmental surfaces. Wash hands. Patient transport . Limit the movement of the patient from the room to essential purposes only. During transport, ensure that all precautions are maintained. Iowa Department of Public Health Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 General Infection Control Measures3 Patient care equipment . When possible, dedicate the use of noncritical patient care equipment to a single patient (or cohort of patients infected or colonized with the pathogen requiring precautions) to avoid sharing between patients. If use of common equipment o r items is unavoidable, then adequately clean and disinfect them before use for another patient. Patient placement (private room) . Place the patient in a private room. If a private room is not available, place the patient in a room with other patients with the same illness (cohorting). Contact Precautions include: Gloves, gown and hand hygiene . Wear gloves when entering the room. During the course of providing care for a patient, change gloves after having contact with infective material. Wear gown to protect clothing if contact with body fluids is anticipated. Remove gloves and gown before leaving the patient's room and practice hand hygiene immediately with an antimicrobial agent or a waterless antiseptic agent. After glove removal and hand hygiene, ensure that hands do not touch potentially contaminated surfaces or items in the patient's room. Droplet Precautions In addition to Standard Precautions, use Droplet Precautions for a patient known or suspected to be infected with microorganisms transmitted by droplets (large-particle, wet droplets [larger than 5\u00b5m in size]) that can be generated by the patient during coughing, sneezing, talking, or the performance of procedures. Examples of diseases/organisms requiring Droplet Precautions include: Invasive Hemophilus influenzae disease: meningitidis disease: meningitis, Group A streptococcal pneumonia, pharnygitis, or scarlet fever in infants and young children Influenza Adenovirus: Also requires Contact Precautions Parvovirus B19 Rubella Droplet Precautions include: Patient placement . Place the patient in a private room. When a private room is not available, place the patient in a room with a patient(s) who has active infection with the same microorganism but with no other infection (cohorting). When a private room is not available and cohorting is not achievable, maintain spatial separation of at least three fee t between the infected patient and other patients and visitors. Special air handling and ventilation are not necessary, and the door may remain open. Iowa Department of Public Health Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 General Infection Control Measures4 Mask. In addition to standard precautions, wear a mask or respirator when working within three feet of the patient. (Hospitals may want to implement the wearing of a mask to enter the room.) Patient transport . Limit the movement and transport of the patient from the room to essential purposes only. If transport or movement is necessary, minimize patient dispersal of droplets by masking the patient, if possible. Airborne Infection Isolation In addition to Standard Precautions, Airborne Infection Isolation measures are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents that may be suspended in the air in either small particle aerosols or dust particles. Patients requiring Airborne Infection Isolation must be given a private room with special air handling and ventilation (negative pressure). Respiratory protection for healthcare workers is nece ssary when entering the patient's room. Examples of diseases/organisms requiring Airborne Infection Isolation include: SARS: See \"SARS Infection Control\" section Tuberculosis (pulmonary or laryngeal, suspected or confirmed) Varicella: Also requires Contact Precautions Herpes Zoster (shingles) in an immunocompromised patient: Also requires Contact Precautions Measles (rubeola) Airborne Infection Isolation includes: Patient placement . Airborne Infection Isolation requires a negative pressure room in addition to a private room. Keep the room door closed and the patient in the room. When a private room is not available, place the patient in a room with a patient who has active infection with the same microorganism, but with no other infection (cohorting). Respiratory protection . Respiratory protection must be worn when entering the room of a patient in Airborne Infection Isolation. A NIOSH-certified, fit-tested disposable N- 95 respirator mask is recommended for all persons entering the room, including visitors. The use of higher-level respirators may be considered for certain procedures. If a particulate respirator with filter efficiency of 95% or greater is not available, a surgical mask should be worn. The mask should fit tightly around the nose and mouth to protect against large droplet transmission. Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette \"Respiratory hygiene\" is a term that has been adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) to describe measures that can be taken to decrease the risk of spreading respiratory pathogens. A universal \"respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette\" strategy for a healthcare facility should include the following: Place signs at the entrances of all outpatient facilities requesting that patients and visitors inform healthcare personnel of respiratory symptoms upon registration. Provide masks (e.g., surgical) for all patients presenting with respiratory symptoms (especially cough) and provide instructions on the proper use and disposal of masks. Iowa Department of Public Health Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 11/12 General Infection Control Measures5 If a patient cannot wear a mask, provide tissues and instructions on when to use them (i.e., when coughing, sneezing or controlling nasal secretions), how and where to dispose of them, and the importance of hand hygiene after handling this material (cough etiquette). Provide hand hygiene materials in waiting room areas and encourage patients with respiratory symptoms to wash their hands. If possible, designate an area in waiting rooms where patients with respiratory symptoms can be segregated (ideally by more than three feet) from other patients without respiratory symptoms. Place patients with respiratory symptoms in a private room or cubicle as soon as possible for further evaluation. Healthcare workers evaluating patients with respiratory symptoms should wear a surgical or procedure mask. Consider the installation of Plexiglas barriers at the point of triage or registration to protect healthcare workers. If a physical barrier is not possible, instruct registration and triage staff to remain at least three feet from unmasked patients. Staff should consider wearing a surgical mask during registration and triage. Continue to use Droplet Precautions to manage patients with respiratory symptoms until it is determined that the cause of symptoms is not an infectious agent that requires precautions beyond Standard Precautions. Iowa Department of Public Health Minimal Recommendations for Use of Surgical or Procedure Masks and Respirators Around Patients with Cough Illness Influenza, pertussis and other diseases are transmitted via droplets produced by coughing . The following infection prevention guidelines are recommended when caring for anyone presenting with a cough illness . Clinicians or infection preventionists may recommend additional infection prevention measures if indicated by a specific patient or situation in the community . Standard Precautions and Droplet Precautions should be used when caring for all patient s with a cough illness. Masks A mask should fit snugly around the nose and mouth to prevent gaps, forcing air flow through the mask. Standard Precautions For complete guidelines visit: www.cdc.gov/hicpac/2007IP/2007isolationPrecautions.html . Droplet Precautions Health care providers should wear surgical or procedure masks when giving direct care to patients with a cough illness. Specimen collection: Use standard and droplet precautions for most specimen collection. Aerosol-generating procedures (e.g. intubation, bronchoscopy, open-system respiratory Particulate respirator (e.g. EU FFP2, USNIOSH-certified N- 95) Eye protection A clean non-sterile, long sleeved gown Gloves (some of these procedures require sterile gloves) Transport within healthcare facilities (for transport of patients with cough illness) . Patient should wear a surgical or procedure mask when outside the patient 's room. Encourage performance of hand hygiene frequently and follow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette practices. Transport between patient residence and healthcare facilities ( for transport of patients with cough illness) Patient should wear a surgical or procedure mask when outside the patient 's room. Transporters should wear a surgical or procedure mask whenever the patient is not masked. Clinics, medical offices or other ambulatory care settings Patients with a cough illness in outpatient settings should be asked to wear a surgical or procedure mask until being examined in the exam room and again upon leaving the exam room. Staff who have close contact, including examining or providing direct patient care, should wear a surgical or procedure mask and put the mask on before entering the room. Staff should perform hand hygiene, and then put on mask followed by gloves. When patient care is complete, first remove gloves, then remove the mask, and lastly perform hand hygiene.

Adenoviruses are a group of viruses that cause respiratory infection, which may have a range of symptoms from the common cold to pneumonia (infection o f the lungs). Adenoviruses may also cause infections of the eye, urinary tract infections in children, diarrhea in infants, and infections of the brain and spinal cord. Patients with poorly functioning immune systems are especially prone to severe and life - threatening infections. Who can be infected? Anyone can be infected. Persons living in close proximity to one another, such as military personnel and persons in long -term care facilities, are more likely to be infected due to the crowding of a suscept ible population. How does a person acquire this infection ? These viruses are spread by fecal -oral transmission or by inhalation of airborne droplets; more importantly, indirectly by hands and articles freshly soiled by discharges of nose, throat, and eyes of an infected person. What are the symptoms? Adenovirus -induced respiratory illness may mimic other diseases, such as pertussis (whooping cough). The most common symptoms of lung and eye infections are cough, fever, sore throat, runny nose, and rednes s of the eyes. Differentiation can be accomplished through a laboratory test. Other symptoms can occur, depending on the site of infection, and may include pain with urination accompanied by increased urinary frequency (urinary tract infections), watery d iarrhea and fever (gastroenteritis). How soon after infection do symptoms appear? The symptoms usually start 4 - 5 days after infection, but may begin as early as 2 days to as late as 14 days. How long can a person spread adenoviruses ? People are most l ikely to spread the virus during the first few days of their illness, but can spread the virus to others for months. What is the treatment for adenoviruses ? There are no specific drugs available for the treatment of adenoviruses. Antibiotics do not work on adenoviruses as they are only effective on bacteria. Most people get well without treatment. How can the spread of adenoviruse s be prevented? 1. Attention to good handwashing should occur at all times. 2. Cover the mouth when coughing and sneezing . 3. Properly dispose of tissues. 4. Avoid crowding in living and sleeping quarters, when possible. 5. Provide adequate ventilation. 6. Avoid smoking in households with small children, whose risk of pneumonia increases when exposed to second -hand smoke. 7. Avoid sharing of eyedroppers, medications, eye make- up, and towels. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Adenovirus 1 FACT SHEET ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE What is Antibiotic resistance? Bacteria are tiny organisms not visible with the human eye. Most bacteria are helpful to us; some are harmful and cause infections. An antibiotic is a prescription drug that can kill or disable disease -causing bacteria. Antibiotic resistance happens when microbes (germs) develop ways to survive the use of medicines meant to kill or weaken them. There are many bacteria that have developed resistance to antibiotics used to treat the infections caused by them. Some of the more common bacteria that are sometimes resistant are Staphylococcus aureus (\"Staph\"), have antibiotic resistant bacteria developed? When antibiotics are used too much, the few bacteria able to survive do so and multiply, eventually making the antibiotic useless. Also, when medicin es are prescribed for an illness and people do not take all of the medication, this will allow the bacteria to regroup into different or resistant strains. Thus, the antibiotic cannot kill the bacteria, and these \"resistant\" bacteria can spread. When do I take antibiotics? Your doctor gives you a prescription for antibiotics when bacteria cause your illness. Does that mean I should take antibiotics for the flu or common cold? No. \"Colds\" and \"flus\" are caused by viruses, not by bacteria. Antibiotics do not work against viruses. If I cannot take an antibiotic for a viral infection, like a cold, flu, or bronchitis what can I do to feel better? Get extra sleep, drink lots of fluids, and eat healthy foods. This helps your body fight viral infections. Over-the-counter medicines like throat lozenges or saline nose spray may help you feel better while your body is fighting the virus. What if I get sick with an infection caused by bacteria that is antibiotic- resistant? Antibiotic- resistant bacterial infections require stronger medicines, are more difficult to treat, and could require a hospital stay. More serious infections of the blood or brain caused by a bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics can be life threatening. What can I do to prevent ant ibiotic -resistant infection? Never ask for or take an antibiotic for a viral infection such as cold, cough, or flu. Use antibiotics only when your doctor prescribes them. Take antibiotics as directed and take all of them, even though you may begin to feel better before you finish all the pills. Never take leftover antibiotics or take a prescription that was used by someone else. Always wash your hands thoroughly, (using soap and water, for 15 seconds) after blowing your nose, using the toilet, diapering, and before eating or preparing food. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Antibiotic -Resistant 1 FACT SHEET CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE What is Clostridium difficile ? Clostridium difficile is a bacteria that causes diarrhea and more serious conditions by producing a toxin after antibiotics have killed off other organisms in the gut. What are the symptoms of Clostridium difficile ? Infection with Clostridium difficile may cause no symptoms, mild symptoms, or severe watery diarrhea and may result in death. How is Clostridium difficile spread? Once a person has Clostridium difficile, it can be spread to othe rs by contact with contaminated environment or unwashed hands. Who gets Clostridium difficile infection? Anyone can get Clostridium difficile, but people who have recently received long term; multiple antibiotics are most likely to get diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile. How is Clostridium difficile diagnosed? In people with symptoms, a test can be done on feces (stool) to detect the bacteria. If found, further testing should be done to make sure that Clostridium difficile is producing the toxin and if it is causing disease. How long is a person infectious? An infected person can spread the bacteria as long as the bacteria is passed in the stool. What is the treatment for Clostridium difficile ? The first treatment is to discontinue or change the a ntibiotic the person is taking. Patients should be watched for dehydration and electrolyte imbalance following prolonged bouts of diarrhea. Antidiarrheal medicines such as Lomotil \u00ae or Imodium\u00ae have been shown to increase the severity of symptoms and should NOT be taken. If the diarrhea worsens or fails to improve within 48 hours, the doctor may choose to treat it with a different medication. Can a person get Clostridium difficile again? Yes. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or ch ild care ? People are not routinely excluded from work, school, or child care. Anyone with food -handling responsibilities should not work until diarrhea has ceased. Child care attendees should not attend until no loose stools have occurred for at least 24 hours. What can be done to help prevent the spread of Clostridium difficile ? Antibiotics should be taken only when necessary and as ordered by the doctor. Good hand washing practices and keeping the environment clean are proven to help prevent the spread of this disease. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Clostridium difficile 1 FACT SHEET CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS Clostridium perfringens ? It is a toxin -producing bacteria frequently found in raw meat (beef, pork, poultry and fish). Some toxic spores survive the initial cooking process and are not completely destroyed. Foods prepared or held under improper conditions permit toxin -producing spores to multiply and, once eaten, the toxins make us sick. What are the symptoms of Clostridium perfringens ? The food poisoning is characterized by sudden onset of moderate -to-severe cramping, gassy pain and watery diarrhea. Vomiting and fever are uncommon. It is generally a mild gastrointestinal disease of short duration, 1 day or less, and rarely fatal in healthy people. How soon do symptoms appear? The symptoms ap pear from 6 - 24 hours after having eaten the implicated food. On the average the symptoms appear within 10 - 12 hours. How is Clostridium perfringens spread? The toxin comes from contaminated foods that are not adequately cooked, improperly reheated, or improperly cooled or stored, and then eaten. Almost all Clostridium perfringens outbreaks are associated with inadequately cooled or heated/reheated meats (usually stews, ground meats, meat pies, and gravies made of beef, turkey, or chicken). Who gets Clostridium perfringens ? Anyone can get this illness from foods that have not been properly cooked, cooled, or reheated. For how long is a person infectious? Since this illness is caused by a toxin and is not transmitted person -to-person, ill people are not infectious. What is the treatment for this illness? Drinking more fluids for rehydration or occasionally, intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement may be indicated for persons with severe dehydration. Antibiotics are not indicated. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or child care? No. What can be done to help prevent the spread of Clostridium perfringens ? Educate all food handlers (home cooks, community meal preparation cooks, and commercial restaurant cooks) on the ri sks of heating, cooling, and reheating large -scale cooking projects, especially meat dishes. Serve hot foods while still hot from initial cooking. Foods should never be held at room temperature to cool, but should be refrigerated after removal from warmi ng devices or serving tables. Serve meat dishes hot, as soon as they are cooked, or cool them rapidly in properly designed chiller and refrigerate until serving time; reheat rapidly if necessary (to an internal temperature of at least 70 \u00b0C/158\u00b0 F, preferably 75\u00b0C/167\u00b0 F). Do not partially cook meat and poultry one day and reheat the next, unless it can be stored at a safe temperature. To chill quickly, divide large batches or cuts of meat or foods into small portions and chill in shallow containers not m ore than 4 -inches deep, and place in a rapid chiller.

In summary: Pregnancy does not usually make a person more susceptible to disease. Reassignment is usually not necessary in caring for ill persons while pregnant. Reassignment of a pregnant employee is indicated if a patient has parvovirus B19, in specific circumstances (see above). Non -immune employees, pregnant or not, should not care for patients with rubella, rubeola, shingles or chickenpox. Remember , hand hygiene is the most important preventive measure to limit disease transmission from one person to another. Standard Precautions, includin g meticulous hand hygiene, must be strictly followed, not just by the pregnant health care provider, but by all health care providers. APIC Central Iowa/District E Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi ewed 10/12 Pregnant Healthcare Worker 2 FACT SHEET CONJUNCTIVITIS (Pink Eye) What is conjunctivitis? It is the most common eye inflammation. The most common causes of acute conjunctivitis are bacteria, viruses, allergens, or sometimes irritation from toxic chemical exposures. Who is at risk? Anyone ! It is most commonly found in children < 5 years of age. What are the symptoms of conjunctivitis ? The onset is sudden with redness of white -colored area of the eyeball and edema or swelling of the lids, secretions that contain mucus and pus , pain, blurred vision, sensitivity to light and occasionally low- grade fever, headache, tiredness and tenderness in the area surrounding the eye(s). How do you get conjunctivitis ? Contact with the discharges from the eye or upper respiratory tracts of infected people, from fingers, clothing and other articles, including shared towels, eye -makeup applicators, multiple dose eye medications soiled with discharges and inadequately sterilized eye examination instruments. How is conjunc tivitis diagnosed? Drainage from the eye can be tested to determine the cause. How is c onjunctivitis treated ? Most types of mild bacterial conjunctivitis and most types of viral conjunctivitis are usually time- limited conditions that require no treatme nt. Some infections may be treated with eye ointments or drops with a doctor's prescription. How can c onjunctivitis be prevented? It can be prevented through personal cleanliness, including frequent handwashing. When washing hands at school or work use paper towels after washing, or the hot air blower. At home, provide a separate towel and face cloth for each member of the household, and wash towels regularly in hot water and detergent. Try not to touch eyes while infected. Do not use common eyedropper, eye medicines, or eye makeup. Make tissues readily available at work or in school classrooms; dispose of them in a trash receptacle after use. Use disposable tissues to blow your nose, sneeze, or cough. Should infected persons be excluded from school or work? Conjunctivitis is usually seen with viral upper respiratory and intestinal infection. People with conjunctivitis caused by either bacteria or virus should wash their hands frequently and use good hand -washing technique. No one should use common towe ls or other toilet articles. People with acute stage conjunctivitis should consult their healthcare provider for treatment. Children should not attend school during the acute stage. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi ewed 10/12 Conjunctivi tis Fact Sheet (CMV) What is Cytomegalovirus (CMV)? CMV is a virus that infects most people, but rarely causes illness. CMV is a member of the herpes virus family. It can \"hide\" in your body without causing illness, then reappear later and cause illness. Who gets CMV? Anyone. Many adults may have already been infected at some time during their life. How is CMV spread? CMV is spread from person to person by direct contact. It is found in the urine, saliva, blood, semen, and other body fluids. The virus can spread from an infected mother to her fetus or newborn baby. CMV can be spread by blood transfusion and organ transplants. What are the symptoms of CMV infection? Most children and adults who are infected with CMV do not become ill. Those w ho do may have fever and swollen glands, and feel tired. Individuals with weakened immune systems such as transplant recipients and those infected with HIV may have a more serious illness, such as pneumonia. About 7 of every 1,000 babies born in the U.S. are infected with CMV at birth. Of these 7 babies, one may have health problems. How soon after infection do symptoms appear? If symptoms develop, they usually occur between 3 - 12 weeks after infection. Most people do not become ill. How long can an inf ected person carry CMV? CMV may remain in the body throughout the person's lifetime. The virus may be found in the urine or saliva of infected people, whether or not they are ill. How is CMV diagnosed and treated? There are special laboratory tests to grow the virus, but testing is difficult, expensive and not widely available. Specific blood tests can be helpful to the physician in making a diagnosis or determining if a person has been exposed, but the results are sometimes inaccurate. Currently, no treat ment exists for CMV infections in healthy individuals. Antiviral treatment may be used for those with immune systems weakened by life threatening illness. An effective vaccine has not been developed. Should an infected person be excluded from school or w ork? No. What precautions should pregnant women take? Pregnant women should carefully wash their hands after handling wet diapers or having contact with urine or saliva. Pregnant women working in childcare centers should not kiss babies or young children on the mouth; hugging is OK. Pregnant women should ask their doctor about CMV infections. What can be done to stop the spread of CMV? Good handwashing is the best way to prevent infection. Healthcare workers should wear plastic disposable gloves when handling sheets or clothing soiled with the feces or urine of persons who are ill. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Cytomegalovirus 1 or N,N is the active chemical ingredient in most insect repellents applied to the skin. It has been tested against a variety of biting insects and has been proven to be an effective insect repellent for mosquitoes, ticks, black flies, fleas, and no -see-ums. Both the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of DEET -based repellents to protect against insect -borne diseases such as West Nile virus. SAFE and EFFECTIVE USE of DEET DEET is safe when used according to label directions. DEET was developed by the U.S. Army in 1946 for use by military personnel in insect -infested areas and w as first registered in the United States in 1957. However a few incidents of toxic reactions to DEET have occurred even when the product was used properly. The length of time that an insect repellent will provide protection from mosquito bites depends on the concentration of DEET in the product. A higher percentage of DEET in a repellent does not provide better protection, just longer protection. It has been proven that products with a DEET concentration over 50% do not increase the length of protection. A higher percentage of DEET should be used if you are outdoors for a long period of time and a lower percentage of DEET should be used if you are outdoors for a short period of time. Products containing up to 30% DEET have been found to be safe for adults. No definitive studies exist in the scientific literature about what concentration of DEET is safe for children. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that insect repellents containing DEET with a concentration of 30% appear to be as safe as products w ith a concentration of 10% when used according to the directions on the product label. DEET is not recommended for use on children under 2 months of age; most experts agree it is safe to apply insect repellent with low concentrations of DEET to children ov er 2 months of age. The safest approach for infants and children under 2 years is to minimize exposure to mosquitoes. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the following guidelines for using insec t repellents containing DEET: Read and carefully follow product label directions and precautions. Apply repellent sparingly on exposed skin and/or clothing. Do not apply DEET underneath clothing. Do not apply repellent near eyes, lips, or mouth. Never apply DEET over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin. Avoid using sprays in enclosed areas. Do not use DEET near food. Do not apply repellent to the hands of young children. Do not allow young children to apply repellents themselves. After returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap and warm water. Avoid over application. Heavy application is not necessary to achieve protection. Wash treated clothing before wearing again.

These diseases are caused by two similar, but distinct, bacteria. Both illnesses are spread by ticks with symptoms similar to Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The illness can range from mild to severe and can possibly become life threatening. What are the symptoms of Human ehrlichiosis? Human ehrlichiosis can cause a sudden high fever, severe headache, fever and shaking chills. Loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches and mental confusion may also occur. A rash is not usually present. Pneumonia -like symptoms may develop. How soon do symptoms appear? The fever and headache usually appear 1 - 2 weeks after a tick bite. How is ehrlichiosis spread? People get ehrlichiosis from ticks, usually by a tick bite. Some people become ill after crushing a tick with their hands because its body fluids get into cuts or scratches in the skin. Ehrlichiosis cannot spread from person to person or from dogs to people. However dogs can bring infected ticks into close contact with people. Who gets ehrlichiosis? Anyone can get ehrlichiosis, especially if they spend a lot of time outdoors. How long is a person infectious? Ehrlichiosis is not spread from person to person. What is the treatment for these illnesses? Antibiotics such as tetracycline or chloramphenicol are used to treat both human mono cytotropic ehrlichiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or child care? No. What can be done to help prevent the spread of Human ehrlichiosis and Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis? 1. Don't walk bare -legged in tall grass or woods where ticks may be found. 2. If outdoors in an area where ticks may be found, wear a long -sleeved shirt, long pants, and high socks. Tuck pants legs into socks. Wear light -colored clothing so ticks can be seen more easily. 3. Conduct \"tic k checks\" every two to three hours if spending a lot of time outdoors. Check all of your skin for ticks every day (you may need help to do this). The ticks are most often found on the thigh, arms, underarms, and legs. Ticks are very small, so look for new \"freckles.\" 4. Use tick repellents containing the ingredients DEET for skin applications, (use precautions and appropriate products for small children) or Permethrin (on clothing). Always follow the directions on the container . These repellents can b e found a t any local drugstore. Wash off all repellents after going indoors. 5. Remove any attached ticks immediately, using the following method. How should a tick be removed? Any tick should be removed as soon as possible. The best way is to use tweezers to grab t he tick as close to the skin as possible and pull it straight out. Do not squeeze the tick's body when removing it. Do not handle ticks with bare hands. Wash your hands after removing a tick. You may want to apply an antiseptic to the bite. Once removed, t he tick should be drowned in rubbing alcohol or the toilet . Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Ehrlichios is Fact Sheet 1 FACT SHEET Vancomycin- Resistant Enterococci (VRE) What is VRE? VRE stands for vancomycin- resistant enterococci. It is a bacteria that cannot be treated with common antibiotics. How does VRE affect people? VRE can cause infections in people or people can become carriers of VRE. VRE can cause infections ranging from in the urine to in the blood. People with an infection can pass the bacteria more easily to other people. People can carry the bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract (gut) or female genital tract without signs of being sick. This is called colonization and these individuals are \"carriers\" of VRE. Who is at risk for VRE infections? Healthy people are not usually at risk for VRE infections. People with more chance of getting VRE include those that are very ill, have an open wound, have been in the hospital for long periods of time or have been given many antibiotics. How is the VRE spread? VRE is usually passed to others by direct contact with stool, urine or blood with VRE in it. VRE can also be spread indirectly by hands of care givers or contact with environmental surfaces that have VRE on them. VRE usually is not spread by casual contact such as touching or hugging. VRE is not spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. What is the most important measure to prevent the spread of VRE? Hand washing is the most important way to prevent the spread of VRE. Proper hand washing includes rubbing your hand wit h soap and warm running water for at least 15 seconds, about the time it takes to sing \"happy birthday\" twice or the ABC song. Proper hand washing should be done after caring for sick people, after handling bandages and clothing of someone with VRE, and a fter going to the bathroom or changing diapers and before preparing food. Can a person with VRE be denied admission to a long term care facility? A person who is a carrier or infected with VRE should not be denied admission to a long -term care facility. VRE, along with other bacteria, may be present in any patient. If a patient who is a carrier or infected is transferred to a long term care facility, that facility should be informed in advance about the existence of VRE. Does a person with VRE have to be separated from healthy individuals? Living with a carrier of VRE presents little or no risk for other members of the household, except those who are at high -risk for VRE infection. A person with VRE infection should be seen by a health care provider before being placed with other people in a household or long -term care facility. How is VRE treated? Persons who are carriers of VRE usually do not need treatment. Persons with VRE infection can be treated with antibiotics other than vancomycin. The patien t's health care provider will recommend treatment based on lab testing. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Information for Health Professionals Fact Sheet FACT SHEET Vancomycin- Resistant Enterococci Information for Health Professionals (VRE) What is VRE? VRE stands for vancomycin- resistant Enterococci and refers to bacteria of the Enterococcus genus that have developed resistance to vancomycin, norm ally used to treat serious Enterococcus infection. In addition to vancomycin, most strains of VRE are also resistant to other standard antibiotics including ampicillin and aminoglycosides. How does VRE affect people? People become carriers of VRE or have infections due to the bacteria. When colonized the organism is carried in the gastrointestinal tract or female genital tract without signs of illness. When infection occurs VRE can have clinical manifestations, ranging from skin lesions to deeper infections such as bacteremia and pneumonia. Who is at risk for VRE infections? Healthy people are not usually at risk for invasive VRE infections. Risk factors include critical illness, underlying disease or immunosuppression, intra -abdominal or cardio -thoracic surgical procedure, indwelling urinary or central venous catheter, prolonged hospital stay, or receipt of broad- spectrum antibiotics or vancomycin therapy. How is the VRE spread? Contact transmission of VRE may be direct (person -to-person) or indirec t via contaminated equipment or environmental surfaces. What is the most important measure to prevent the spread of VRE? Hand hygiene using antimicrobial soap and warm running water for at least 15 seconds, or an alcohol based hand rub is the single most important measure to control the spread of VRE. Proper hand hygiene should be performed after the care of each patient, after handling soiled dressings and clothing, and after wearing gloves. Ensure frequent and proper cleaning of patient -care equipment and the environment. What else can be done to prevent the spread of VRE? Other measures to prevent becoming infected or transmitting infection to others are avoiding cross - contamination between clean and dirty linen, daily environmental cleaning, wearing gloves for all dressing changes, proper handling of infectious waste, and observing isolation procedures. Hand hygiene before and after each patient contact is the most important control measure. How is VRE treated? Persons carrying VRE but not exhibitin g symptoms (colonized) usually do not need to be treated. Persons with active infections currently have limited treatment options, but may include multiple antibiotics for a prolonged period of time. National VRE guidelines are available at.

Enteroviruses are the second most common cause of viral infections in people. Enteroviruses are the leading cause of viral infections. There are currently 64 types of enteroviruses, which cause a wide variety of illnesses with fever, including three vaccine preventable enteroviruses that cause polio. What are the symptoms of enterovirus illness? Most people infected with an enterovirus have no symptoms. Some enteroviruses cause symp toms similar to the cold or flu such as fever, body aches, sore throat and mild to moderate skin rash. Less often these viruses can cause more serious symptoms such as meningitis (swelling of the spinal nerve cords) or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). Infants, children and adolescents are more likely to become infected and develop illness from enteroviruses than adults. What time of year do enteroviral infection occur? These viruses are most common in the summer and fall. How soon do symptoms a ppear? If any symptoms appear they normally appear from 2 - 10 days after infection. The usual duration of illness is 3 - 6 days. What are the complications of enterovirus infections? Severe headache, backache, and abdominal pain may occur. Swelling and ulcers can develop in the throat and mouth. The muscles of the heart can become swollen and, in some unusual cases, \"bloodshot\" eyes can occur with swelling around the eyes. The most severe cases can develop meningitis, encephalitis, and a polio -like pa ralysis. How does a person become infected with one of these viruses? These viruses are spread by direct contact with food, water or surfaces that have been contaminated with stool. Some strains of enteroviruses are occasionally transmitted through the a ir and can cause a respiratory illness. How is the disease diagnosed? These diseases are usually mild in nature and diagnosed based on symptoms. Blood tests and specific viral testing are available. How are the infection and its complications treated? There are no specific drugs to fight these viruses, but some medications can be used to make the person feel better. Although you can develop immunity to one virus, you can still get sick with any of the other enteroviruses. How can enterovirus infection be prevented? Unfortunately, there are no vaccines for these viruses. Good personal hygiene, especially handwashing before handling food and after using the bathroom and/or changing diapers, can reduce the spread of these viruses. Iowa Dept. o f Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Enterovirus 1 FACT SHEET FIFTH DISEASE (erythema infectiosum) What is Fifth Disease? Fifth disease is generally a mild illness caused by a virus, parvovirus B19. It usually causes a \"slapped - cheek\" rash in infected children. Adults are more likely to have pain or sw elling of the joints or flu -like symptoms. What are the symptoms of an infection with Fifth Disease? An ill child typically has a \"slapped cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low -grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill and the rash resolves in 7 - 10 days. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. How soon do symptoms appear? Usually within 4 -14 days but may be as long as 20 days, after exposure. How is this virus spread? The virus is spread by contact with droplets produced by infected people coughing and sneezing. The most common time of year for spread is late winter and spring. Those at increased risk include healthcare workers, childcare workers, teachers, and mothers with infected children at home. Who gets Fifth Disease? More than 50% of adults have had prior exposure, and therefore do not get Fift h Disease again. It is most common in elementary -age children, but anyone can contract the disease. For how long is a person infectious? A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. Once the rash appears, the virus probably can no longer be spread to others. What is the treatment for this illness? Treatment of symptoms such as fever, pain, or itching is usually all that is needed for fifth disease. Adults with joint pain and swelling may need to rest, restrict their activities, and take medicines such as aspirin or ibuprofen to relieve symptoms. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or childcare? Once the rash appears, the virus probably can no longer be spread to others. It is not necessary for children to be kept home from school or child care. What can be done to help prevent the spread of these viruses? Good hygiene, especially good handwashing is the best way to prevent spread. What risk does this pose to pregnancy? If a pregnant woman becomes infected, the fetus can also become infected. Fetal death can occur in a small percentage of cases and the risk is greater when infection occurs in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. There is, however, no evidence to indicate that this virus causes birth defects. Occasional babies infected with the virus before birth can develop severe anemia and heart failure. What should pregnant women do if they feel they have been exposed? They should talk to their doctor . Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Fifth Disease 1 Wha t follow -up is needed in women with at -risk pregnancies? If a woman becomes infected while pregnant, blood tests should be drawn. Several ultrasounds are recommended to detect more severe complications (usually performed weekly for 8 - 12 weeks). Occasio nally more specialized tests are needed. In severe cases, the fetus may need a blood transfusion, which is then followed up by further ultrasounds. Is infection with Parvovirus B19 an indication for pregnancy termination? No, termination is neither neces sary nor recommended. A successful outcome will occur in over 90% of cases.

For outbreaks where an index case (i.e., food handler) contaminates the food resulting in several ill persons, the index case is not considered part of the first cluster of illness, and the primary mode of transm ission for the outbreak would be considered foodborne. Food - If initial transmission of illness is associated with ingestion of a common, potentially contaminated food/beverage item Water - If initial transmission of illness is associated with ingestion of potentially contaminated water source (including bottled water) It may be difficult to determine whether some outbre aks should be reported through the foodborne or the waterborne sections.

The index case should not be considered part of the initial cluster of illness. Environmental contamination other than food/water - If initial transmission of illness is associated with an environmental contaminant. En vironmental contamination is simila r to person-to-person transmission (e.g. if someone vomits in a public restroom and th e following day people become sick after visiting the same restroom, although, the initial person is long gone) Indeterminate/Other/Unknown - If the source of initial transmission of illness was not identified, other, or unknown Investigation Methods (Please select all that apply) : Interviews only of ill persons - Select if only ill pers ons were interviewed Case-control study - This is an observational study to evaluate the relationship between an exposure (e.g. eating contaminated food; swimming in contamin ated water; having direct contact with a sick person) and a particular outcome (e.g. illness). Ther e are two categories of st udy participants, people who have the outcome of interest (cases) and people who do not have the outcome of interest (controls). Select this method if both ill pers ons and non-ill persons who may have had common exposures were interviewed, and this investigation method was completed. Cohort study - This is an epidemiological study that is used to assess outcomes (e.g. the development of gastrointestinal illness) in a group/cohort of pe ople. Study participants are observed over time or counted to determine how many people experience the outcome of interest, and when the outcome occurred. Members in a cohort are defined accordi ng to their exposure profile (e.g. an exposed group and an unexposed group). In outbreak investigations, a cohort is frequently defined by membership in an organization (e.g. a boy scout troop attending a weeklong camp).

For outbreaks where multiple modes of transmission are suspected but cannot be separa ted from one another, classify all cases as primary cases. However, list suspected secondary tran smission modes in the Ge neral Section: Secondary Cases. Any cases that are ill via a clearly defined secondary mode of transmission (e.g. household contacts of a case in a foodborne or waterborne disease outbreak) should still be deta iled in the General Section: Secondary Cases.

For example, if c ases ingested contaminated beef on April 30th and episodes of diarrhea started May 4th, the incubation period would be 5 days. Indicate the shortest, median, and longest incubation pe riod, and the total number of primary cases for whom information is available. If sufficient data is not available to calculate a particular range, leave that range blank. In addition, select the appropriate units (minutes, hours, or days). If the incubation period is unknown, select \"Unknown incubation period\". Duration of illness (among those who have recovered) : The duration of illness is the time between the onset of the first symptom to the end of final gastrointestinal symp toms For example, a case had episodes of diarrhea that started on March 4th and vomiting that started on March 5th. The diarrhea ended on March 6th, but vomiting continued until March 7th, so the duration of illness would be 4 days. Indicate the shortest, longest and median duration of illness, and the total number of primary cases for whom information is available among those who ha ve recovered. If sufficient data is not available to calculate a particular range, leave that range blank. In addition, select the appropriate units (minutes, hours, or days). If duration of illness is unknown, se lect \"Unknown duration of illness\". Symptoms, Signs and Outcomes: The following signs, symptoms and outcomes refer only to primary cases that resulted from the primary mode of transmission. Enter the number of cases (numerator) for whom specific symptom information is known. A new symptom may be added if it is not already in the list; however, it is very important to look carefully for the symptom before adding it and to spell any new symptoms correctly. New symptoms can be used by all NORS users almost immediately after they are added to the list. Each symptom has a unique ID number that users cannot see; duplicate symptoms or multiple variations of a word (e.g. headache, headache, headaches) may make it diffic ult to use that symptom in future data analyses and might be confusing to other NORS users. Foodborne disease outbreaks: If Escherichia coli enterohemorrhagic (e.g., E. coli O157:H7) is the implicated etiology, please enter available data for hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). If no cases were asked about HUS, enter zero for '# Cases with signs or symptoms' and 'Total number of cases for whom information was available' If the number of cases who were asked about HUS is unknown, leave 'Total number of cases for whom information was available' blank. For example, four cases of E. coli enterohemorrhagic were all asked if they had HUS. One case reported HUS and three said that did not know if they had HUS: o '# Cases with signs or symptoms'= 1 and 'Total number of cases for whom information was available'= 4. 5 of 42Last updated 12/31/2008 General Section: Secondary Cases Secondary Cases: A secondary case is one in which the person was not directly exposed to the food, water, or person that was implicated in the initial outbreak but had another, indire ct exposure that led to illness (most commonly, person-to- person contact with a primary case). For outbreaks where mu ltiple modes of transmission are suspected but cannot be separated from one another, classify all cases as pr imary cases. However, list susp ected secondary transmission modes in the General Section: Secondary Cases. Any case s that are ill via a clearly defined secondary mode of transmission (e.g. household contacts of a case in a fo odborne or waterborne disease outbreak) should still be detailed in the General Section: Secondary Cases. Secondary Mode of Transmission (Please select only one) : This field refers only to secondary mode of transmission (if more than one mode of transmission, the secondary mode of transmission would yield the second cluster of illness in the outbreak) Food - If secondary transmission of illness is associated with ingestion of a common, potentially contaminated food/beverage item Water - If secondary transmission of illness is associated wi th ingestion of potentially contaminated water source (including bottled water) It may be difficult to determine whether some outb reaks should be reported th rough the foodborne or the waterborne sections.

A CF should be identified only if the investigator has strong evidence that it actually occurred in this outbreak; just because a factor has been cited in similar outbreaks in the past does not mean it was involved in this outbreak. Please select any and all CFs that are causally associated with the outbreak. After consideration of all epidemiological, laboratory, and environmental assessment information available, if contributing factors for this outbreak could not be determined, then at the top of the contributing factors section, the box \"Contributing Factors Unknown\" should be checked. If this box is checked, then the remainder of the contributing factors section should be left completely blank. Classification CFs are classified into 3 categories (contamination, proliferation/amplification, and survival factors): Contamination Factors Factors that introduce or otherwise permit contamination. Contamination factors relate to how the etiologic agent got onto or into the food vehicle. There are 15 contamination factors, numbered C1 - C15. C-N/A is utilized if contamination factors were not related to the type of etiologic agent involved in the outbreak. C-N/A should rarely, if ever, be cited. If no contamination factors were identified, then leave all contamination factors blank. Then, please explain why contamination factors could not be identified in the \"Remarks\" section at the end of this report. Proliferation/Amplification Factors Factors that allow proliferation or growth of etiologic agents. Citation of proliferation/amplification factors is only applicable when bacterial agents are involved. Proliferation factors relate to how bacterial agents were able to increase in numbers and/or produce toxic products prior to the vehicle being ingested. There are 12 proliferation/amplification factors, numbered P1 - P12. 16 of 42 P-N/A is utilized if proliferation/amplification factors are not related to the type of etiologic agent involved in the outbreak. For example, proliferation/amplification factors would not be cited in a viral outbreak. If no proliferation/amplification factors were identified, then leave all proliferation/amplification factors blank. Then, please explain why proliferation/amplification factors could not be identified in the \"Remarks\" section at the end of this report. Survival Factors Factors that allow survival or fail to inactivate the contaminant. Citation of survival factors is only applicable when microbial agents are involved. Survival factors refer to processes or steps that should have eliminated or reduced the microbial agent but did not because of one of these factors. There are 5 survival factors, numbered S1 - S5. S-N/A is utilized if survival factors were not related to the type of etiologic agent involved in the outbreak. For example, survival factors would not be cited in a scombroid toxin outbreak. If no survival factors were identified, then leave all survival factors blank. Then, please explain why survival factors could not be identified in the \"Remarks\" section at the end of this report. How to Identify Contributing Factors in an Outbreak In a food borne outbreak, an environmental assessment is a systematic process designed to gather as much information as possible to describe the environmental circumstances prior to the exposure(s) that caused a foodborne outbreak. From this evaluation process, factors that most likely contributed to the outbreak may be identified. Each environmental assessment will be unique to a specific outbreak. It should include some or all of the following: a) A visit to the location where suspected food vehicles are grown, harvested, processed, prepared and/or served; b) A review of the physical facilities and the equipment used; c) Interviews with those involved in the harvest, processing, handling and/or preparation of the implicated foods; d) A review of the menus in food-service establishments such as restaurants, delis, quick service restaurants, or institutional food service facilities including schools, nursing homes, and hospitals; e) Development of a food flow for implicated foods that includes notes on preparation policies and practices, points of possible contamination and individuals involved, and/or; f) Reenactment of the preparation of foods involved in the outbreak. Not e: Identification of contributing factors should be based on an environmental assessment of the outbreak, not results of routine environmental inspections . For example, during an outbreak investigation, improper cooling may be observed. This risky practice may or may not be relevant to the outbreak. Contributing factors cited should fit within the context of epidemiological and laboratory findings for the outbreak wherever possible. Reporting of contributing factors should not be limited to outbreaks associated with food-service establishments such as restaurants. They can be reported when associated with other outbreak locations as well. 17 of 42Contributing Factors Flowchart for Foodborne Disease Outbreaks Action: 1.

If this box is checked, then the remainder of the contributing factors section should be left completely blank. Contamination Factors Factors that introduce or otherwise permit contamination; contamination factors relate to how the etiologic agent got onto or into the food vehicle. Code Factor Description C1 Toxic substance part of tissue Title C1 - Toxic substance part of the tissue Definition/Explanation A natural toxin found in a plant or animal, or in some parts of a plant, animal, or fungus; -OR- A chemical agent of biologic origin that occurs naturally in the vehicle or bioaccumulates in the vehicle prior to or soon after harvest. Common Examples Mushroom poisoning due to consumption of toxic mushrooms. Ciguatera fish poisoning due to consumption of tropical marine finfish which have bio accumulated naturally- occurring ciguatera toxins through their diet. Scombroid fish poisoning due to consumption of fish containing elevated levels of histamine should be cited as C1. However, if there is environmental or traceback evidence of temperature abuse, then please also identify P4 or P5 (as appropriate) in addition to C1. Notable Exceptions None. 21 of 42Code Factor Description C2 Poisonous substance intentionally / deliberately added Title C2 - Poisonous substance intentionally/deliberately added Definition/Explanation A poisonous substance intentionally/deliberately added to a food in quantities sufficient to cause serious illness. Poisons added because of sabotage, mischievous acts, and attempts to cause panic or to blackmail a company fall into this category. Common Examples Cyanide or phenolphthalein deliberately added to food to cause illness. Methomyl pesticide intentionally added to food to cause illness. Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description C3 Poisonous substance accidentally / inadvertently added Title C3 - Poisonous substance accidentally/ inadvertently added Definition/Explanation A poisonous substance or chemical agent was accidentally/inadvertently added to the vehicle. This addition typically occurs at the time of preparation or packaging of the vehicle. Misreading labels, resulting in either mistaking poisonous substances for foods or incorporating them into food mixtures, would also fall into this category. Common Examples Sanitizer or cleaning compound accidentally added to food. Notable Exceptions None. 22 of 42Code Factor Description C4 Addition of excessive quantities of ingredients that are toxic in large amounts Title C4 - Addition of excessive quantities of ingredients that are toxic in large amounts Definition/Explanation An approved ingredient in a food can be accidentally added in excessive quantities so as to make the food unacceptable for consumption. Common Examples Niacin poisoning in bread. Too great an amount of nitrites in cured meat. Too great an amount of ginger powder in gingersnaps. Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description C5 Toxic container Title C5 - Toxic container Definition/Explanation The container that held or conveyed the implicated food is made of toxic substances. The toxic substance either migrates into the food or leaches into solution by contact with highly acid foods. Common Examples Galvanized containers with acid food A toxic metal (e.g. zinc coated) container used to store highly acid foods Notable Exceptions For this contributing factor, there may be confusion between foodborne outbreaks and waterborne outbreaks. If the outbreak is waterborne, then the contributing factors should be listed in the waterborne section, not in this foodborne section. In general, waterborne disease includes contamination occurring in the source water or in the treatment or distribution of water to the end consumer. For example, in drink mix/soda machines, if the water enters a contaminated machine or if there is a problem with the internal plumbing of the machine resulting in contamination (e.g., cross-connections, backflow of carbonated water resulting in copper leaching) - it's waterborne and should not be entered in the foodborne section. For ice, if ice is made with contaminated water - it's waterborne and should not be entered in the foodborne section. However, if ice is already made and then it becomes contaminated because it was stored in a toxic container - it's a foodborne outbreak and it would be appropriate to list C5 as a contributing factor. 23 of 42Code Factor Description C6 Contaminated raw product - food was intended to be consumed after a kill step Title C6 - Contaminated raw product - food was intended to be consumed after a kill step Definition/Explanation The vehicle or a component of the vehicle contained the agent when it arrived at the point of final preparation or service. This contributing factor applies to foods intended to be consumed after undergoing a kill step (such as cooking to the required temperature) but this food processing step was insufficient to lower the levels of the pathogen below an infectious dose. Note: Lab confirmation or a formal traceback can support or confirm the identification of this contributing factor (i.e. a traceback identifies a flock, herd, or farm as the source of the pathogen). If a lab results are available or if a traceback was conducted, please complete the lab confirmation and/or the traceback sections (as appropriate) in this outbreak's NORS report. Common Examples A hamburger was ordered well-done or medium-well, but it was subsequently undercooked. When it arrived at final preparation, raw chicken was contaminated with Salmonella, which was then unintentionally undercooked. Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description C7 Contaminated raw product - food was intended to be consumed raw or undercooked / under-processed Title C7 - Contaminated raw product - food was intended to be consumed raw or undercooked/under-processed Definition/Explanation Contaminated products are ingested raw without being first subjected to a cooking step or another form of a kill step sufficient to kill any pathogens present. This contributing factor applies to foods intended to be consumed raw, as well as foods intended to be consumed after mild heating, or another process which does not ensure pathogen destruction. Com mon Examples A hamburger or steak ordered to be prepared \"rare\" Raw milk Raw oysters or other shellfish Raw produce Unpasteurized cider or juices Certain dishes where raw or rare beef is consumed 24 of 42 Foods that are intentionally not fully-cooked such as hollandaise sauce containing raw egg yolk or sunny-side- up eggs where the yolk was not denatured. Ceviche (citrus-marinated seafood appetizer which is intentionally served without prior heating) Prosciutto (aged, dry-cured, spiced Italian ham which is served uncooked) Salted cod (dry-salted cod fish which is served uncooked) or cold-smoked salmon Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description C8 Foods originating from sources shown to be contaminated or polluted (such as a growing field or harvest area) Title C8 - Foods originating from sources shown to be contaminated or polluted (such as a growing field or harvest area) Definition/Explanation Foods that originated from sources shown to be contaminated or polluted (such as a growing field or harvest area). Note : Formal traceback may support or confirm the identification of this contributing factor. This factor would typically be cited along with another contamination factor, such as C6 or C7. Common Examples Shellfish from sewage-polluted waters or closed beds Crops watered by contaminated irrigation water Produce grown in contaminated soil Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description C9 Cross- contamination of ingredients (cross- contamination does not include ill food workers) Title C9 - Cross-contamination of ingredients (cross-contamination does not include ill food workers) Definition/Explanation The pathogen was transferred to the vehicle by contact with contaminated worker hands, equipment, or utensils; drippage or spillage. If worker hands were the mode of contamination, the worker was not infected with or a carrier of the pathogen. Common Examples Contaminated raw poultry was prepared on a cutting board, and later, a ready-to-eat food was cross- contaminated because it was prepared on this same cutting board without intervening cleaning. 25 of 42 A worker's hands became contaminated by raw foods, and subsequently, a ready-to-eat food was cross- contaminated because the worker's hands touched this ready-to-eat food without intervening hand-washing. Cloths, sponges, and other cleaning aids are used to clean equipment that processed contaminated raw foods. Before next use, these cleaning items were not disinfected; instead, these cleaning items are used to wipe surfaces that come in contact with foods that are not subsequently heated. Contaminated raw foods touch or fluids from them drip onto foods that are not subsequently cooked. Notable Exceptions This contributing factor only applies to foods that are cross-contaminated by other ingredients. If food contamination was the direct result of the storage environment, then it should be cited in C14 (storage in contaminated environment). Code Factor Description C10 Bare-hand contact by a food handler / worker / preparer who is suspected to be infectious Title C10 - Bare-hand contact by a food handler/worker/preparer who is suspected to be infectious Definition/Explanation A food worker, who is suspected to be infectious, uses his/her bare hands to touch/prepare foods that are not subsequently cooked. The term \"infectious\" is an all-inclusive term used to describe all persons who are colonized by, infected with, a carrier of, or ill due to a pathogen. Potential reasons to suspect that a food worker is \"infectious\": a) The food worker recently displays or admits a combination of foodborne disease symptoms (such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fever, etc) that may be similar to symptoms identified in those who are ill in the outbreak investigation; b) If a food worker's household member exhibits similar symptoms directly preceding the outbreak; c) The food worker tested positive for a foodborne pathogen; d) Other epidemiologically- or environmentally-linked reasons. Note: C10 should only be cited if there is evidence of bare-hand contact of an implicated food item. If there is no evidence of bare-hand contact or it is unknown whether the food worker was wearing gloves or not, then cite C12 instead. If there is evidence for both bare-hand contact and gloved-hand contact with the implicated food item, both C10 and C11 should be cited. Common Examples This is a typical situation that precedes outbreaks caused by norovirus or staphylococcal enterotoxins. Notable Exceptions None. 26 of 42Code Factor Description C11 Glove-hand contact by a food handler / worker / preparer who is suspected to be infectious Title C11 - Glove-hand contact by a food handler/worker/preparer who is suspected to be infectious Definition/Explanation A food worker, who is suspected to be infectious, uses his/her gloved- hands to touch/prepare foods that are not subsequently cooked. The term \"infectious\" is an all-inclusive term used to describe all persons who are colonized by, infected with, a carrier of, or ill due to a pathogen. Potential reasons to suspect that a food worker is \"infectious\": a) The food worker recently displays or admits a combination of foodborne disease symptoms (such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fever, etc) that may be similar to symptoms identified in those who are ill in the outbreak investigation; b) If a food worker's household member exhibits similar symptoms directly preceding the outbreak; c) The food worker tested positive for a foodborne pathogen; d) Other epidemiologically- or environmentally-linked reasons. Note: C11 should only be cited if there is evidence of glove-hand contact of an implicated food item. If there is no evidence of glove-hand contact or it is unknown whether the food worker was wearing gloves or not, then cite C12 instead. If there is evidence for both bare-hand contact and gloved-hand contact with the implicated food item, both C10 and C11 should be cited. Common Examples This is a typical situation that precedes outbreaks caused by norovirus or staphylococcal enterotoxins. Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description C12 Other mode of contamination (excluding cross- contamination) by a food handler / worker / preparer who is suspected to be infectious Title C12 - Other mode of contamination (excluding cross-contamination) by a food handler/worker/preparer who is suspected to be infectious Definition/Explanation A food worker, who is suspected to be infectious, contaminates the food by another mode of contamination other than bare-hand contact or glove-hand contact, or epidemiological/ environmental investigation determines that an infectious food worker contaminates food with his/her hands but the investigation is unable to determine whether or not the food worker was wearing gloves during food preparation. This contaminated food is subsequently not cooked. 27 of 42 The term \"infectious\" is an all-inclusive term used to describe all persons who are colonized by, infected with, a carrier of, or ill due to a pathogen. Potential reasons to suspect that a food worker is \"infectious\": a) The food worker recently displays or admits a combination of foodborne disease symptoms (such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fever, etc) that may be similar to symptoms identified in those who are ill in the outbreak investigation; b) If a food worker's household member exhibits similar symptoms directly preceding the outbreak; c) The food worker tested positive for a foodborne pathogen; d) Other epidemiologically- or environmentally-linked reasons. Common Examples Epidemiological or environmental investigation determines that an infectious food worker contaminates food with his/her hands but is unable to determine whether or not actual bare-hand contact or glove-hand contact contaminated the food. In norovirus outbreaks, an ill food worker's aerosolized vomitus contaminates ready-to-eat food. Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description C13 Foods contaminated by non-food handler / worker / preparer who is suspected to be infectious Title C13 - Foods contaminated by non-food handler/worker/preparer who is suspected to be infectious Definition/Explanation A person other than a food handler/worker/preparer who is suspected to be infectious, contaminates ready-to-eat foods that are later consumed by other persons, resulting in spread of the illness. A \"non-food handler/worker/preparer\" is considered to be any person who is not directly involved in the handling or preparation of the food prior to service. The term \"infectious\" is an all-inclusive term used to describe all persons who are colonized by, infected with, a carrier of, or ill due to a pathogen. Potential reasons to suspect that a non-food worker is \"infectious\": a) The non-food worker recently displays or admits a combination of foodborne disease symptoms (such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fever, etc) that may be similar to symptoms identified in those who are ill in the outbreak investigation; b) If a non-food worker's household member exhibits similar symptoms directly preceding the outbreak; c) The non-food worker tested positive for a foodborne pathogen; d) Other epidemiologically- or environmentally-linked reasons. Common Examples This is a typical situation when an ill person attends an event and contaminates ready-to eat-foods in a buffet 28 of 42line by handling food prior to someone else consuming it. The original ill person is identified as a source of the pathogen. Pizza is prepared by a healthy food worker and arrives pathogen-free. A mother (a non-food worker) rearranges pizza slices onto plates before serving the slices to a group of children at a birthday party (regardless of whether it is taking place as a private party where the pizza has been ordered in or if the party is taking place in a restaurant). These children subsequently develop foodborne illness and the mother is identified as a source of the pathogen. Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description C14 Storage in contaminated environment Title C14 - Storage in contaminated environment Definition/Explanation Storage in a contaminated environment (such as a store room or refrigerator) leads to contamination of the food vehicle or an ingredient in the vehicle. Th is usually involves storage of dry foods in an environment where contamination is likely from overhead drippage, flooding, airborne contamination, access of insects or rodents, and other situations conducive to contamination. Common Examples A leaky roof permits condensation to seep into a walk-in refrigerator and contaminate food stored in it. Notable Exceptions This contributing factor only applies to stored foods contaminated directly by environmental sources in the storage environment, not cross-contamination by other ingredients. 29 of 42Code Factor Description C15 Other source of contamination Title C15 - Other source of contamination Definition/Explanation A form of contamination that does not fit into the above categories; the factor should be specified in the \"Remarks\" section at the end of the report. Common Examples Food in an uncovered bowl contaminated by flies Food that is being washed/soaked in a food preparation sink is contaminated by sewage backflow from the sink's pipes Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description C-N/A Contamination Factors - Not Applicable Title C-N/A - Contamination Factors - Not Applicable Definition/Explanation C-N/A is utilized if contamination factors were not related to the type of etiologic agent involved in the outbreak. C-N/A would rarely, if ever, be cited. If no contamination factors were identified, then leave all contamination factors blank. Then, please explain why contamination factors could not be identified in the \"Remarks\" section at the end of this report. 30 of 42 Proliferation/Amplification Factors (bacterial outbreaks only) Factors that allow proliferation of the etiologic agents; proliferation factors relate to how bacterial agents were able to increase in numbers and/or produce toxic products prior to the vehicle being ingested. Code Factor Description P1 Food preparation practices that support proliferation of pathogens ( during food preparation ) Title P1 - Food preparation practices that support proliferation of pathogens ( during food preparation ) Definition/Explanation During food preparation, one or more improper procedures occurred (such as improper or inadequate thawing) that allowed pathogenic bacteria and/or molds to multiply and generate to populations sufficient to cause illness or to elaborate toxins if toxigenic. Common Examples Improper thawing (such as allowing frozen food to thaw at room temperature or leaving frozen foods in standing water for prolonged periods) allows pathogens on the surface of the food to multiply and generate Prolonged preparation time (such as prolonging preparation time by preparing too many foods at the same time) allows pathogens to multiply and generate Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description P2 No attempt was made to control the temperature of implicated food or the length of time food was out of temperature control ( during food service or display of food) Title P2 - No attempt was made to control the temperature of implicated food or the length of time food was out of temperature control ( during food service or display of food) Definition/Explanation During food service or display of food, there was no attempt made to control the temperature of the implicated food or no attempt was made to regulate the length of time food was out of temperature control. Common Examples Leaving foods out at ambient temperature for a prolonged time at a church supper No time or temperature control on a buffet line Notable Exceptions None. 31 of 42Code Factor Description P3 Improper adherence of approved plan to use Time as a Public Health Control Title P3 - Improper adherence of approved plan to use Time as a Public Health Control Definition/Explanation Food was out of temperature control for more than the time allowed under an agreed-upon and pre-approved plan by a regulatory agency to use Time as a Public Health Control. Common Examples Foods are placed on a buffet table that is not capable of maintaining proper hot or cold temperatures. The establishment has a plan approved by a regulatory agency to use Time as a Public Health Control. The plan allows foods to be displayed for service on the buffet line at ambient temperature, and discarded after 4 hours. However, the food is held on the buffet table for longer than 4 hours (either inadvertently or intentionally). A facility negotiates a plan to use Time as a Public Health Control with a regulatory agency; however, the facility improperly adheres to the plan because some of the dishes that the facility serves is traditionally held and served at room temperature longer than the time allowed in the approved plan. Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description P4 Improper cold holding due to malfunctioning refrigeration equipment Title P4 - Improper cold holding due to malfunctioning refrigeration equipment Definition/Explanation Malfunctioning refrigeration equipment (such as refrigerators that are improperly maintained or adjusted) causes foods to be held at an improper cold holding temperature. Common Examples Walk-in cooler malfunction causing elevated temperatures of food The reach-in (or walk-in) refrigerator unit temperature is not monitored and stays consistently higher than 41\u00b0 F (or 45\u00b0 F) causing elevated temperatures of food A broken or torn door gasket causes air leakage in a reach-in refrigerator and subsequently food remains above 41\u00b0 F (or 45\u00b0 F). Notable Exceptions None. 32 of 42Code Factor Description P5 Improper cold holding due to an improper procedure or protocol Title P5 - Improper cold holding due to an improper procedure or protocol Definition/Explanation Improper cold holding temperature occurs due to an improper procedure or protocol (such as an overloaded refrigerator or inadequately iced salad bar). Common Examples Potentially hazard foods (PHF) such as tuna/egg salad are stacked above the top levels of the cold holding wells in a deli sandwich cold holding unit Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description P6 Improper hot holding due to malfunctioning equipment Title P6 - Improper hot holding due to malfunctioning equipment Definition/Explanation Equipment that is meant to be used for hot-holding malfunctions and causes foods to be held at an improper hot holding temperature. Common Examples A steam table is improperly maintained or adjusted and causes food to be held at improper hot holding temperatures. Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description P7 Improper hot holding due to improper procedure or protocol Title P7- Improper hot holding due to improper procedure or protocol Definition/Explanation Improper hot holding temperature occurs due to an improper procedure or protocol. Common Examples An inadequate number of Sterno cans are used for holding foods hot in chafing dishes Exhausted Sterno cans are not replaced under chafing dishes which hold hot foods Steam table was not turned on 33 of 42 Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description P8 Improper/slow cooling Title P8 - Improper/slow cooling Definition/Explanation Foods are refrigerated in large quantities or stored in devices where the temperature is poorly controlled allowing pathogens to multiply. Common Examples Foods are refrigerated in large quantities (i.e. in large masses or as large volumes of foods in containers), which does not allow proper cooling F oods are stored in containers with tight-fitting lids, pans are stacked on top of others, or crowded storage in a refrigerator, all of which leads to inadequate air circulation and thus improper/slow cooling Improperly cooling foods includes any procedures outside of these parameters: Cooling foods from 135\u00b0 F to 70\u00b0 F within 2 hours and cooling that food from 70\u00b0 F to 41\u00b0 F within the next 4 hours. Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description P9 Prolonged cold storage Title P9 - Prolonged cold storage Definition/Explanation This situation is a concern for psychrotrophic pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum type E, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila ) that multiply over sufficient time at ordinary refrigerator temperatures and generate to populations sufficient to cause illness or elaborate toxins if toxigenic (e.g. C. botulinum ). Common Examples Holding foods (that have been prepared in a food-service establishment) in cold storage for more than 7 days Holding open containers of commercially prepared foods for several weeks Notable Exceptions None. 34 of 42Code Factor Description P10 Inadequate modified atmosphere packaging Title P10 - Inadequate modified atmosphere packaging Definition/Explanation Food was stored in a container which provided an anaerobic environment. These factors create conditions conducive to growth of anaerobic or facultative bacteria in foods held in hermetically sealed cans or in packages in which vacuums have been pulled or gases added. All anaerobic bacteria must have a low oxygen reduction potential to initiate growth, but this factor is restricted only to foods that are put into the sealed package or container. Common Examples Vacuum-packed fish Salad in gas-flushed bag Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description P11 Inadequate processing (acidification, water activity, fermentation) Title P11 - Inadequate processing (acidification, water activity, fermentation) Definition/Explanation There are certain non-temperature-dependent processes (such as acidification, water activity, fermentation) that are designed to prevent proliferation of pathogens. However, if these processes are inadequate, pathogens will multiply and generate to populations sufficient to cause illness. Common Examples Insufficient acidification (low concentration of acidic ingredients) in home canned foods Insufficiently low water activity (low concentration of salt) in smoked/salted fish Inadequate fermentation (starter culture failure or improper fermentation conditions) in processed meat or processed cheese Notable Exceptions None. 35 of 42Code Factor Description P12 Other situations that promoted or allowed microbial growth or toxic production Title P12 - Other situations that promoted or allowed microbial growth or toxic production Definition/Explanation A factor that promotes growth, proliferation, amplification, or concentration of etiologic agents but that does not fit into any of the other defined categories; the factor should be specified in the \"Remarks\" section at the end of the report. Common Examples A box of tomatoes was unknowingly contaminated by Salmonella prior to its arrival at a restaurant. Soon after the delivery, some of the tomatoes were served to customers but these customers did not become ill. However, some of the other tomatoes from the box were not served soon after delivery - instead, these intact tomatoes were allowed to ripen at room temperature for several days, which allowed the Salmonella to amplify. Customers who ate these room-ripened tomatoes became ill. Although allowing intact tomatoes to ripen at room temperature is not a Food Code violation, this process likely led to bacterial proliferation. Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description P-N/A Proliferation/Ampli fication Factors - Not Applicable Title P-N/A - Proliferation/Amplification Factors - Not Applicable Definition/Explanation P-N/A is utilized if proliferation/amplification factors are not related to the type of etiologic agent involved in the outbreak. For example, proliferation/amplification factors would not be cited in a viral outbreak. If no proliferation/amplification factors were identified, then leave all proliferation/amplification factors blank. Then, please explain why proliferation/amplification factors could not be identified in the \"Remarks\" section at the end of this report. 36 of 42 Survival Factors (microbial outbreaks only) Factors that allow survival or fail to inactivate the contaminant; survival factors refer to processes or steps that should have eliminated or reduced the microbial agent but did not because of one of these factors. Code Factor Description S1 Insufficient time and/or temperature during cooking/heat processing Title S1 - Insufficient time and/or temperature control during initial cooking/heat processing Definition/Explanation The time/temperature exposure during initial heat processing or cooking was inadequate to kill the pathogens. This does not include inactivation of preformed heat-stable toxins. In reference to cooking, but not retorting, it refers to the destruction of vegetative forms of bacteria, viruses, and parasites, but not bacterial spores. If the food under investigation was retorted, then spore-forming bacteria would be included. Common Examples Insufficient time and/or temperature control for roasted meats/poultry, canned foods, pasteurization Notable Exceptions Citation of S1 does not include inactivation of preformed heat-stable toxins or destruction of bacterial spores during cooking. Code Factor Description S2 Insufficient time and/or temperature during reheating Title S2 - Insufficient time and/or temperature during reheating Definition/Explanation The time/temperature exposure during reheating or heat processing of a previously cooked food (which has often been cooled, frequently, overnight) was inadequate to kill the pathogens. This does not include inactivation of preformed heat-stable toxins. Common Examples Reheating of sauces or roasts to a temperature insufficient to reduce the level of contamination to below an infectious dose. Notable Exceptions Citation of S2 does not include inactivation of preformed heat-stable toxins. 37 of 42Code Factor Description S3 Insufficient time and/or temperature control during freezing Title S3 - Insufficient time and/or temperature control during freezing Definition/Explanation In order to ensure the destruction of certain parasites, some foods such as fish may be frozen before raw service. This factor is cited when there was insufficient time and/or temperature control during freezing. Common Examples Pacific red snapper is the implicated food in an outbreak of Anisakis infection. The snapper was not frozen before service in raw sushi or the investigation revealed that the time and temperature required to kill parasites (-31\u00b0 F for 15 hours or 4\u00b0 F for 7 days) was not utilized. Notable Exceptions Freezing is currently utilized for parasite destruction in fish served raw. In the future if it is determined that freezing can be used for pathogen destruction in other situations, then this factor would be cited if established procedures are not implemented or implemented incorrectly. Some species of tuna are not susceptible to harboring parasites of concern and thus freezing is not necessary. Care should be taken in determining if freezing would have been an appropriate pathogen destruction process for the fish in question before this factor is cited. Code Factor Description S4 Insufficient or improper use of chemical processes designed for pathogen destruction Title S4 - Insufficient or improper use of chemical processes designed for pathogen destruction Definition/Explanation There are certain chemical processes (such as acidification, salting, and cold smoking) that are designed to prevent survival of pathogens. However, if these processes are insufficient or improperly used, pathogens will survive. Common Examples Inadequate acidification (such as insufficient quantity or concentration of acid) of canned tomatoes results in pathogen survival Inadequate cold smoking of meat (such as insufficient time of contact of the smoke with the meat) results in pathogen survival Notable Exceptions None. 38 of 42 Code Factor Description S5 Other process failures that permit pathogen survival Title S5 - Other process failures that permit pathogen survival Definition/Explanation A form of survival that does not fit into the above categories; the factor should be specified in the \"Remarks\" section at the end of the report. Common Examples Failures of other processes (such as subjecting foods to irradiation, high pressure, drying conditions) that permits pathogens to survive. Notable Exceptions None. Code Factor Description S-N/A Survival Factors - Not Applicable Title S-N/A - Survival Factors - Not Applicable Definition/Explanation S-N/A is utilized if survival factors were not related to the type of etiologic agent involved in the outbreak. For example, survival factors would not be cited in a scombroid toxin outbreak. If no survival factors were identified, then leave all survival factors blank. Then, please explain why proliferation/amplification factors could not be identified in the \"Remarks\" section at the end of this report. 39 of 42Last updated 12/31/2008 The confirmed or suspected point of contamination (check one): Indicate if confirmed or suspected point of contamination occurred 'Before preparation' or at 'Preparation.' For example, if a multi-state outbreak was linked by PFGE to samples obtained from a processing plan t, one might conclude that the contamination occurred 'before preparation.' Often, it will be difficult to make this delineation without a traceback, but please indicate based on your investigation whether yo u would conclude that c ontamination occurred before preparation or at preparation. If the confirmed or suspected point of contamination o ccurred 'before preparation,' indicate if it occurred at 'Pre-Harvest,' 'Processing,' or 'Unknown.'

It is bacteria found in the mucus layer of the stomach lining or first part of the small intestine, which causes more than 90% of ulcers. Ulcers are sores in the lining of the stomac h. Before 1982, when this bacterium was discovered, spicy food, acid, stress, and lifestyle were considered the major causes of ulcers. Since we now know that most ulcers are caused by an infection with H. pylori , most cases can be treated and cured with appropriate antibiotics. What are the symptoms of H. pylori ? The most common ulcer symptom is gnawing or burning pain in the stomach area between the breastbone and the navel. Commonly, the pain occurs when the stomach is empty, between meals and in the early morning hours, but it can also occur at other times of the day. Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, one or more of the following signs may occur : vomiting blood, passing bloody stools, and/or the presence of dark stools or dark vomit, which may indicate old bleeding. How is H. pylori spread? It is not known how H. pylori is transmitted or wh y some people become symptomatic while others do not. The bacteria are most likely spread from person to person through fecal -oral or oral -oral routes. Possible environmental reservoirs include contaminated water sources. Who gets H. pylori ? About two -thirds of the world's population is infected with H. pylori . In the United States, H. pylori are found more often in older adults, African Americans, Hispanics, and among people in lower socioeconomic groups. We do not know how H. pylori get into the body or why some people with H. pylori become ill while others do not. The bacteria most likely spread from person to person through the fecal -oral route (when infected fecal matter comes in contact with hands, food, or water and is swallowed) or the oral - oral route (when infected saliva or vomit comes in contact with hands, food, or water and is swallowed). What is the treatment for this illness? The treatment for H. pylori infection consists of 1 -2 weeks of one or two effective antibiotics. Successful treatment rates range from 70 to 90% depending on the regimen used. Antibiotic resistance and patient noncompliance are the two major reasons for treatment failure. What can be done to help prevent the spread of these viruses? Since the source of H. pylori is not yet known, recommendations for avoiding infection have not been made. In general, it is always wise for persons to wash hands thoroughly, to eat food that has been properly prepared, and to only drink water from a safe, clean source. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Helicobacter pylori 1 FACT SHEET Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease What is Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease? Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common illness of infants and children caused by a Coxsackie virus. What are the symptoms of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease ? It is characterized by fever, sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters. HFMD begins with a mild fever, poor appetite, malaise (\"feeling sick\"), and frequently a sore throat. One or 2 days after the fever begins, painful sores develop in the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become ulcers. The sores are usually located on the tongue, gums, and inside of the cheeks. The skin rash develops over 1 - 2 days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters. The rash does not itch, and it is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It may also appear on the buttocks. A person with HFMD may have only the rash or the mouth ulcers. How soon do symptoms appear? The usual period from infection to onset of symptoms (\"incubation period\") is 3 - 5 days. Fever is often the first symptom of HFMD. How are these viruses spread? The virus is spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or kisses someone else. The virus is also spread by coming in contact with the stool o f an infected person, as when changing diapers. HFMD is not transmitted to or from pets or other animals. Who gets Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease? Anyone, especially children. For how long is a person infectious? A person is most likely to spread the disease to others during the first week of the illness. The Coxsackie virus may be found in the throat of an infected person for 2 weeks (even if there are no lesions in the mouth) and in the stool for several weeks after infection. Infected persons who do not appear to be ill may also spread the virus. What is the treatment for this illness? No specific treatment is available. Symptomatic treatment is given to provide relief from fever, aches, or pain from the mouth ulcers. Patients almost always fully rec over. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or child care? HFMD outbreaks in child care facilities usually coincide with an increased number of cases in the community. Keeping children and adults from activities outside the home usually will not reduce spreading of the disease because people may spread the virus without becoming very ill, and others who become ill may continue to have the virus in their bowel movements for weeks after recovering. Therefore, a child does not need to be kept away from child care unless: The child is unable to participate comfortably because of their illness. Child care staff determine they cannot care for the child without compromising the care of other children in the group. Example: Managing an infant with excessive drooling due to mouth sores may be difficult due to the nature of group infant care and the infectious nature of the drool. The infant may need to be kept away from a child care center until the sores heal up in the mouth. The child meets other exclusion criteria such as fever, diarrhea, vomiting, etc. Adults are not usually kept away from work since most adults with this virus will not have any symptoms. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 6/12 Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease 1 What can be done to help prevent the spread of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease? Good handwashing, especially after handling soiled tissues, using the bathroom or changing diapers, is the best way to prevent infection with the Coxsackie virus. Healthcare workers should wear disposable gloves when handling sheets or clothe s soiled with the feces or saliva of persons who are ill. In child care facilities: Make sure that all children and adults use good handwashing technique, especially after toileting, assisting with toileting, diaper changes, sneezing or coughing and wiping noses. Thoroughly clean contaminated surfaces and items and sanitize with properly diluted bleach water. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 6/12 Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease 2 FACT SHEET HANDWASHING Wash Your Hands! How you wash and dry your hands makes a difference: Use soap and warm or hot running water. Wash for at least 15 seconds. Wash all surfaces, including wrists, palms, backs of hands, between fingers, and as much as possible under fingernails, by rubbing vigorously. Rinse hands under running water. Away from home, dry hands with disposable paper towels or the hot air blower. At home, provide a separate towel for each member of the household, and wash towels regularly i n hot water and detergent. When should I wash my hands? Before you: Eat Prepare food for yourself or others Treat a break or cut in the skin Care for an ill or injured person or animal Insert or remove contact lenses Immediately after you: Use the restro om Handle uncooked foods (especially raw meat poultry or fish) Change a diaper Blow your nose, sneeze, or cough Touch an animal (especially a reptile), including animals in petting zoos and fairs. Why is handwashing important? Your skin constantly makes oil that stays on its surface. Germs that get on your skin are trapped in the oil. Skin does not have to look dirty to be loaded with tiny germs that can cause big problems - like the common cold, diarrhea, and more serious diseases. Washing your hands w ith soap and warm running water is one of the best and easiest things you can do to stay healthy. But I wash my hands a lot - We are all in a hurry - to eat, get back to work, make that important meeting or class. Too often we forget or \"don't have time, \" or we think a quick cold -water rinse will do. But that doesn't \"cut it\"...literally! Oils, and any attached germs, must be removed from the skin. A splash of cold water and a quick rub with a towel doesn't do much good. You need to use warm water and so ap to get the oil and germs off your skin. When you've been touching things many people have handled, routine handwashing can help reduce your chances of getting an infection. Should I use antibacterial soap? The most important thing to remember is to wa sh with warm running water and soap. If you want to use antibacterial soap, keep in mind that it helps kill some germs - but not all. Some germs can't be killed, no matter how strong the soap is or how long it is on your hands. You may not always have s pecial soap with you. That is why it's very important to spend enough time and care to wash germs away. You may wish to use an antimicrobial soap or alcohol based hand rub if you are ill or caring for someone who is, or has a weakened immune system. To do the most good, washing your hands has to become a habit. You're more likely to learn a new habit and stick with it if it's easy. Most of the time, proper handwashing is easy. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi ewed 10/12 Handwashing 1 Should I use towelettes? Antimicrobial towelettes may be used in place of regular soap and water. They are not as effective as alcohol based hand rubs or antimicrobial soaps, so are not a substitute for them. Can I use a waterless hand sanitizer lotion or gel with alcohol? Using this type of product is ok, except when hands look dirty; then washing your hands with soap and warm water is a must. Alcohol is not as effective at killing germs when dirt is present. When using, use the amount of an alcohol -based hand rub recommended by the manufacturer. Apply the product to the palm of one hand, and rub hands together, covering all surfaces of the hands and fingers, until hands are dry. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi ewed 10/12 Handwashing 2 FACT SHEET A fungus called Histoplasma capsulatum , which exists in two distinct forms, a mold and yeast, causes histoplasmosis. The mold form is found in the soil, often in areas where bird and bat droppings are loc ated. The bird droppings are found to enhance growth of the fungus. The yeast form is found in infected people. Histoplasmosis is a disease that usually involves the lungs, but may affect other areas of the body. In the U.S., most cases are found along the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. What are the symptoms of histoplasmosis? Most infected persons have no apparent ill effects. Respiratory symptoms, a general ill feeling, fever, chest pains, and a dry or nonproductive cough characterize the acute respiratory disease. Distinct patterns may be seen on a chest x -ray. Chronic lung disease resembles tuberculosis and can worsen over months or years. The disseminated form is fatal unless treated. Five disease forms are recognized: 1. An \"asymptomatic form\" where no illness occurs, but people may have an altered laboratory test. 2. An \"acute benign respiratory form\" with flu -like symptoms that vary from a mild respiratory illness to a short term illness with general tiredness, fever, chills, headache, muscle ach es, chest pains and non -productive cough. 3. An \"acute disseminated (scattered throughout) form\" with fever, vomiting or diarrhea, and enlarged lymph nodes and or spleen. Without treatment this form may be fatal. This stage usually occurs in infants, young children, and immune compromised people. 4. A \"chronic disseminated form\" with fever (which may come and go), weight loss, weakness, enlarged liver and spleen, and mild blood abnormalities. Other areas of the body may be affected, including the heart and the covering of the brain or spinal cord. Ulcers of the mouth, larynx, stomach or bowel may also occur. This form usually develops over 10 -11 months and is usually fatal unless treated. 5. A \"chronic pulmonary form,\" which resembles tuberculosis of the lungs both in symptoms and on x -ray. The symptoms may include night sweats, loss of weight, loss of appetite and a chronic cough lasting longer than three weeks. This form occurs most often in middle -aged and elderly men with other lung diseases. How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms usually occur within 3 -17 days after exposure. Many infections are overlooked; since they either have no symptoms or cause such a minor, brief respiratory illness that the person does not seek medical care. If you have questions regarding any of the above symptoms contact your healthcare provider or the Iowa Department of Public Health at (800) 362 -2736. How is histoplasmosis spread? The fungus is found in the soil and transmitted through the air. Transmission occurs when soil is disturbed, causing the fungus to become airborne. People then breathe in the fungus. Once inside a person's body the fungus will start growing and cause disease. The disease cannot be transmitted from one person to another. Who gets histoplasmosis? Anyone can be infected. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Histoplasmosis 1 For how long is a person infectious? The disease cannot be transmitted from one person to another. What is the treatment for this illness? Histoplasmosis is sensitive to many drugs. The treatment may be long term lasting from sev eral months up to a year. Antifungal medications are used to treat severe cases of acute histoplasmosis and all cases of chronic and disseminated disease. Mild disease usually resolves without treatment. Past infection results in partial protection against ill effects if reinfected. See your healthcare provider for more specific treatment information. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or child care? No, the disease cannot be transmitted from one person to another. What can be done to help prevent the spread of this fungus? Workers cleaning up or disturbing soil at possibly contaminated sites should wear a mask. Before disturbing soil, spray the area with water or oil to minimize spread. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Histoplasmosis 2 FACT SHEET HISTOPLASMOSIS Veterinary What is histoplasmosis? Histoplasma capsulatum is a mycotic organism that exists in two distinct forms. The mold form is found in the soil, often in areas where bird and bat feces are located. The excrement is found to enhance growth of the fungus. The yeast form is located in infected living tissue. In the U.S., most cases are found along the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys and usually involve the immunocompromised population including children, the el derly or HIV -infected humans. What are the symptoms of histoplasmosis? Most infected persons have no apparent ill effects. Respiratory symptoms, a general ill feeling, fever, chest pains, and a dry or nonproductive cough characterize the acute respiratory disease, otherwise indistinguishable from other common respiratory infections. Distinct patterns may be seen on a chest x - ray. Chronic lung disease resembles tuberculosis and can worsen over months or years. The disseminated form is fatal unless treated. Five disease forms are recognized 1. An \"asymptomatic form,\" where no illness occurs, but people may have an altered laboratory test. 2.

If you have questions regarding any of the above symptoms contact your health- care provider or the Iowa Department of Public Health at (800) 362 -2736. How is histoplasmosis spread? The spores of the fungus are found in the soil and transmitted through the air. Spores inhaled by susceptible individuals will then germinate and produce disease. The infective form of the organism cannot be transmitted from an infected person to another. Who gets histoplasmosis? Anyone can be infected. For how long is a person infectious? The disease cannot be transmitte d from one person to another. What is the treatment for this illness? Histoplasma capsulatum is sensitive to many antifungals including amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and fluconazole. Treatment is long term requiring several months up to a y ear. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Histoplasmosis 1 Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or child care? No, the disease cannot be transmitted from one person to another. What can be done to help prevent the spread of this fungus? The disease in relatively rare and is often associated with soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings. Minimize exposure to dust in a known or potentially contaminated environment. Spray with water or oil to reduce dust. Workers cleaning up possible contaminated sites should wear masks or respirators. In certain settings decontamination with 5% formaldehyde solution may be necessary.

Influenza antiviral drugs can be used to treat influenza if given within 48 hours of symptom onset . These medications are also used to prevent influenza in people who have been exposed to the virus. Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza because vaccination can be given well before influenza virus exposures occur, and it provides safe and effective immunity throughout the influenza season. Antiviral medications are 70% to 90% effective in preventing influenza. Treatment with Antiviral Medications Antiviral drugs are used to prevent and to treat viral illnesses, like influenza. They often are used to control influenza outbreaks in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes or in people who are at risk for serious complications due to influenza. Influenza antiviral medications should be started as soon as possible after symptom onset. These medications have not been shown to be effective if administered more than 48 hours after onset of symptoms. Approved Antiviral Medications Two FDA -approved influenza antiviral medications are recom mended for use in the United States : and zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae). Oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu \u00ae) is approved to both treat and prevent influenza A and B virus infection in people one year of age and older. Zanamivir (brand name Rel enza \u00ae) is approved to treat influenza A and B virus infection in people 7 years and older and to prevent influenza A and B virus infection in people 5 years and older. There is a second class of influenza antiviral medications known as adamantanes that are licensed in the U.S. for the treatment and prevention of influenza. However, because a high proportion of circulating influenza viruses in the U.S. in recent years have been resistant to the adamantanes, CDC recommends that neither be used for the treatment or prevention of influenza in the United States. Where can I get antiviral medication? Antiviral medications are available by prescription only through your health care provider . What are the possible side effects of antiviral medication? There are different side effects for each of the antiviral drugs. If your health care provider and/or pharmacist have given you antiviral drugs, ask how to take them and any possible side effects. Who will be helped most form antiviral drugs? People 65 years of age and older Children 12 months of age and older Immunocompromised individuals (people with HIV or those receiving immunosuppressive medications like chemotherapy) People with chronic medical conditions (e.g., heart or lung disease, diabetes) Prevention for people who have been vaccinated for less than two weeks Prevention for unvaccinated people caring for those at high risk (e.g., employees of hospitals, clinics, nursing homes) Prevention for people who cannot receive influenza vaccine due to an egg allergy or other contradiction Treatment of persons with influenza who live with or care for high risk people Treatment of high risk persons with influenza What can you do to protect yourself and others from influenza?

Iowa Department of Public Health Influenza Fact Sheet for Businesses - Spanish Revised October , 2010 4 Iowa Department of Public Health Fact Sheet Influenza Recommendations for Businesses What is influenza? The flu is a contagious respiratory illness casued by influenza viruses. Influenza is a highly contagious virus that affects mainly the nose, throat, chest, and lungs. It can casue mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccination each year. Common Symptoms of Influenza Fever (typically 100\u00b0 F) Headache Extreme tiredness Dry cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle aches Stomach symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, also can occur but are more common in children than adults. Infectious Period People may be able to infect each other one day before symptoms occur and up to 10 days after being sick. The Spread of Influenza Flu viruses mainly spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing of people with influenza. Sometimes people may become infected by touching something with flu viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose. Most healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning one day before symptoms develop and up to five days after becoming sick. That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. Why you should get the flu vaccine every year The influenza virus changes every year as it makes its way around the world. Since the exact flu viruses are almost never the same from year to year, the strains of influenza in the vaccine changes each year. This is why you need to get a new flu vaccine every year. The vaccine only protects you from influenza for one year. Vaccination Yearly flu vaccination should begin as soon as the vaccine is available, usually early in the fall. This will provide protection for the entire flu season. Who should get vaccinated? Yearly flu vaccination is recommended for almost everyone over 6 months of age, and is especially important for those people at high risk for developing flu- related complications, such as children younger than five; adults 65 years of age and older; pregnant women; and people with certain medical conditions like heart and lung problems, and diabetes. The Nasal Spray V accine Vaccination with the nasal spray flu vaccine (FluMist \u00ae) is an option for healthy people 2- 49 years of age who are not pregnant and healthy persons who live with or care for those in a high risk group. The one exception is healthy persons who care for persons with severely weakened immune systems who require a protected environment; these healthy persons should get the inactivated vaccine. The Spread of Influenza Flu viruses mainly spread from person- to-person through coughing or sneezing of people with influenza. Sometimes people may become infected by touching something with flu viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose.

That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. What things can I do to prevent or reduce the spread of influenza in my office? Annual influenza vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza. Stay home when sick. Employees with symptoms of influenza should not come to work. Excluding ill employees from the work place can help reduce the spread of the illness to other employees. If possible, allowing employees to work from home when ill can help reduce the spread of disease. Wash hands often. People often catch influenza and other viruses by picking up the virus on their hands, and then touching their nose, eyes, or mouth. Wash hands several times a day, using soap and warm water for 15- 20 seconds (this is generally around the time it takes to sing the ABC song). Dry hands with paper towels or automatic hand dryers. Restrooms should be checked regularly to ensure that soap and paper towels are available for employee use. Cover your coughs and sneezes. Influenza is often spread by coughs and sneezes. Make sure disposable tissues are available in work areas for runny noses and sneezing. Individuals should always cover their mouths with their upper arm or a tissue when coughing and use a tissue when sneezing or blowing their nose. Tissues should be thrown away immediately, and then hands should be washed. Use hand sanitizer. Encourage the use of alcohol -based hand sanitizer at employee desks. Hand sanitizer is effective in killing germs on hands when they are not visibly soiled. Appropriate times to use hand sanitizer are after coughing, sneezing, or contact with infected surfaces (e.g. contact with a keyboard). Contact your health care provider. Emplo yees should contact their physician when they become ill during influenza season. Anti -viral drugs may reduce the severity and length of illness when they are taken early in the illness. Antivirals need to be started within 48 hours of becoming ill to be effective. Avoid close contact. Employees should avoid sharing of saliva by not sharing glasses, forks, spoons, etc. Clean surfaces often. Common use surfaces, such as water fountains, door handles, handrails, eating surfaces, desks, and phones should be cleaned frequently with disinfectants. Commercial disinfectants or bleach solutions are appropriate. (Mixing \u00bc cup bleach with 1 gallon of water makes bleach solution. This should be mixed fresh daily).

The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Influenza is a highly contagious virus that affects mainly the nose, throat, chest, and lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccination each year. The Spread of Influenza Flu viruses mainly spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing of people with influenza. Sometimes people may become infected by touching something with flu viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose. Most healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning one day before symptoms develop and up to five days after becoming sick. That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. Infectious Period People may be able to infect each other one day before symptoms occur and up to 10 days after being sick. Prevention in Child Care Facilities Stay home when sick. Any staff or child suspected of having influenza should not attend child care. Wash hands often. Wash hands frequently using soap and warm water for 15- 20 seconds (this is generally around the time it takes to sing the ABC's). Dry hands with paper towels or automatic hand dryers, if possible. If cloth towels are used, replace them with clean towels several times a day. Each child should have their own cloth towel. Young children should be instructed and assisted to ensure proper hand washing. Restrooms should be checked regularly to ensure that soap and towels are available. Wash after wiping noses. Proper hand washing is particularly important after wiping your own or someone else's nose, or after contact with drool, saliva or nose drainage. Influenza can be spread from coughs or sneezes. Make sure tissues are available for runny noses and sneezing. Staff and children should cover their mouth with their upper arm or a t issue when coughing and use a tissue when sneezing or blowing their nose. Tissues should be thrown away immediately, and then hands should be washed. Make sure tissues are available in the day-care business and transport vehicles for runny noses and sneez ing. Remind children not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth. Germs often spread this way. Use hand sanitizer. Encourage the use of alcohol- based hand sanitizer when hand washing is not possible. Hand sanitizer is effective in killing germs on hands when they are not visibly soiled. (e.g., contact with phone, child's nose, and doorknob). Keep your business open if possible. Closing a child care business in the event of an outbreak is usually not recommended. If a center closes parents are more likely to take sick and well children to other centers, which spreads the illness to other centers. Avoid close contact. All children and staff should avoid sharing of saliva by not sharing glasses, forks, spoons, toothbrushes, and toys. Clean frequently and appropriately. In the child care, frequently clean commonly used surfaces, such as door handles, handrails, eating surfaces, toys, and phones . Commercial disinfectants or bleach solutions should be used. (Mixing \u00bc cup bleach with 1 gallon of water makes bl each solution.) Why children and child care workers should get the flu vaccine every year The influenza virus changes every year as it makes its way around the world. Since the exact flu viruses are almost never the same from year to year, the strains of influenza in the vaccine changes each year. This is why you need to get a new flu vaccine every year. The vaccine only protects you from influenza for one year. Vaccination Yearly flu vaccination should begin as soon as the vaccine is available, usually early in the fall. This will provide protection for the entire flu season.

The one exception is healthy persons who care for persons with severely weakened immune systems who require a protected environment; these healthy persons should get the inactivated (injectable) vaccine. Antiviral Medications Influenza antiviral drugs are prescription medicines (pills, liquid, or an inhaler) that fight against the flu by keeping flu viruses from reproducing in your body. Antiviral drugs can make you feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. This could be especially important for people at high risk. These medications are only effective if started within 48 hours after symptoms start. Influenza antiviral medication may also be used to prevent sickness in people who have been exposed to someone with influenza. What should I do to protect myself and my family from the flu? Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 15- 20 seconds. Wash your hands before and after eating, going to the bathroom, or touching pets, phones, or keyboards. Use hand sanitizer . If you cannot wash your hands, alcohol -based hand cleaner may be used if your hands do not look dirty. Stay home from work or school when you are ill, and encourage others to do the same. Stay away from others you know are ill. You are less likely to become ill if you stay at least three feet from someone who is coughing or sneezing. Vaccination . The first line of defense against influenza is to get your influenza vaccination each year. Contact your health care pro vider . If you experience flu -like symptoms contact your physician. Your physician may be able to prescribe antiviral medications for you to shorten the duration of the illness and prevent transmission. Clean frequently and appropriately . Frequently clean commonly used surfaces, such as door handles, handrails, eating surfaces, toys, and phones. Commercial disinfectants or bleach solutions should be used. (Mixing \u00bc cup bleach with 1 gallon of water makes bleach solution. Must be made fresh daily) Some viruses can live from 20 minutes up to two hours or more on some surfaces. Reviewed 10/12 General Public For more information on influenza visit our website at: www.idph.state.ia.us/Cade/Influenza.aspx?pg=FluHome Iowa Department of Public Health Fact Sheet Influenza Recommendation for the Vaccination of Health Care Professionals Why should health care professionals be immunized for influenza? Individual, family and patient protection- health care professionals are at an increased risk for acquiring influenza and the influenza vaccine is the best defense against infection. Herd immunity - more people vaccinated for influenza results in fewer people getting influenza and spreading it in the community. The influenza vaccine works in the same way that other vaccines do- once a significant proportion of the population has received the vaccine disease incidence drops sharply. Influenza vaccine reduces the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza or transmitting influenza to others. There are two types of vaccines: Trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) - TIV is an inactivated vaccine (containing killed virus) that is given by injection. TIV is approved for use in people older than 6 months, including healthy persons and those with chronic medical conditions. TIV formulations include a regular injection for those 6 months old or older, a higher dose formulation for those 65 and older, and an intradermal formulation for those 18 to 64 years old. Live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV or FluMist \u00ae) - LAIV contains a live, weakened influenza virus that is administered intranasally by sprayer. LAIV is approved for use in healthy people 5 years to 49 years of age who are not pregnant. TIV is preferred over LAIV for health care professionals who are in close contact with immunosuppressed persons (e.g. stem cell transplant patients) when patients require a protective environment. Timing of vaccination To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination of persons at increased risk for serious complications of influenza, vaccine may be offered as early as September if available. The optimal time for vaccination efforts is usually during October - November. Vaccine should continue to be sought and administered throughout the influenza season even after influenza activity has been established in the community. Why people should get the flu vaccine every year The influenza virus changes every year as it spreads around the world. Since the exact flu viruses are almost never the same from year to year, the strains of influenza in the vaccine changes each year. This is why people need to get a new flu vaccine every year. The vaccine only protects people from influenza for one year. Who should get vaccinated?

Other things health care facilities can do to ensure influenza vaccination In June, 2006 the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations approved an infection control standard that required accredited organizations to offer influenza vaccinations to staff and volunteers who have close patient contact. The following are recommendations provided by HICPAC/ACIP* for hospitals: Educate health care professionals (HCP) on the benefits of influenza vacci nation. Offer influenza vaccine annually to all eligible HCP. Use either TIV or LAIV for eligible persons. Provide influenza vaccination to HCP at the work site and at no cost. Obtain signed declination from HCP who decline influenza vaccination for non- medical reasons. Monitor influenza vaccination coverage and declination at regular intervals throughout the season. Use the level of HCP influenza vaccination coverage as one measure of a patient -safety quality program. Although vaccination rates for health care professionals are typically <40%, with moderate effort, organized campaigns can attain higher rates of vaccination among this population. Physicians, nurses, and other professionals with direct patient contact, including medical emergency -response professionals (paramedics and emergency medical technicians), should be vaccinated, as should employees of nursing home and long- term care facilities. * Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) and the Advisory Committee on Immuniz ation Practices (ACIP) Revised 10/12 Recommendations for the Vaccination of HCP's For more information on influenza, visit our website at: www.idph.state.ia.us/Cade/Influenza.aspx?pg=FluHome Iowa Department of Public Health Fact Sheet Influenza Recommendations for Long -Term Care Facilities Influenza The flu is a contagious illness caused by influenza viruses.

Employees of nursing homes and long- term care facilities who have direct patient/resident contact and residents should be vaccinated against influenza. What are influenza antiviral drugs ? Influenza antiviral drugs are prescription medicines (pill, liquid, and inhaler) that fight against the flu by keeping flu viruses form reproducing in people. Antiviral drugs can make influenza illness milder and make people feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. This could be especially important for people at high risk. How antiviral medications are used for the flu . Receiving a flu vaccine each year is the best way to protect people from the flu; antiviral drugs can be used as a second line of defense to treat the flu or to prevent flu infection. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms). When used this way, these drugs can reduce the severity of flu symptoms and shorten the time people are sick by one or two days. They also may make people less contagious to other people. How effective are antiviral drugs? When used to prevent the flu, antiviral drugs are about 70% to 90% effective. It's important to remember that flu antiviral drugs are not a substitute for getting a flu vaccine. Antiviral medication is on ly effective if taken within 48 hour s of symptom onset. Antiviral medications approved for influenza . For seasonal guidelines about the use of antiviral medications, visit: www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/index.htm . Actions to take to prevent or reduce the spread of influenza in your facility Cover coughs and sneezes. Transmission commonly occurs from unprotected coughs or sneezes. Make sure tissues are available at all times. Encourage residents and staff to cover their mouths when coughing and use a tissue when sneezing or blowing their nose. Tissues should be disposed of immediately, followed by proper hand washing (alcohol hand gels may be used). Stay home when ill. Any staff member suspected of having influenza should be sent home and stay home for the duration of the illness. Use standard and droplet precautions.

Staff and residents should be encouraged to practice good hand hygiene at all times. This means using warm water and soap for at least 15- 20 seconds each time. Alcohol hand gels may be used if hands are not soiled. Clean frequently. Common use surfaces such as door handles, handrails, game table surfaces, and phones should be cleaned regularly (approximately twice daily) with disinfectant. (Bleach solutions or commercial disinfectants are appropriate.) Isolate ill residents. Ill residents should stay in their rooms. Non- ill roommates should be relocated to other rooms. If many residents are ill, cohorting to a specific area or ward may be considered. If cohorting of residents is practiced, staff should be cohorted also, i.e., those staff caring for ill residents should not also care for the well residents. Screen for illness in visitors.

Work with the local public health agency (LPHA) to decrease transmission of these viruses and possibly decrease the school's outbreak impact on the community at large Ramp up cleaning. Conduct thorough environmental cleaning daily. Include stair hand rails, doorknobs, and other commonly touched surfaces. Notify and educate parents. Send an information letter home to parents as early in the outbreak as possible. Be sure to include the following items: Symptoms of influenza, to aid in recognition of when a child has the flu; W hen a child has the flu, they should stay home; and The importance of yearly influenza vaccine, especially children with health problems like asthma. Hand washing. Teach and encourage children and staff to wash hands regularly with warm water and soap. Consider having children wash hands with soap and water for at least 15- 20 seconds before and after eating, recess, gym class and every other situation involving frequent child to child interaction. Be a good role model. Use hand sanitizer. Consider the use of alcohol -based hand sanitizers in the classroom when soap and water are not readily available. Limit gatherings. Limit assemblies, large group gatherings and interactions with other schools during periods of high absence (when absence is at or above 10%). Think about vaccination. Consider holding influenza vaccine clinics. Work with LPHA to determine feasibility and logistics. This is best done before outbreaks occur. Once an outbreak is occurring, vaccination of children can help to control the outbreak or limit spread within a school district and/or county. Target more than the affected school to yield the best results. Utilize resources. Use the resources at the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) as well as the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Visit the influenza web site at www.idph.state.ia.us/Cade/Influenza.aspx?pg=FluHome or www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm for fact sheets, student activities, and more.

Some viruses and bacteria can live from 20 minutes up to two hours or more on surfaces like cafeteria tables, doorknobs, and desks. Nearly 22 million school days are lost annually due to the common cold alone. Addressing the spread of germs in schools is essential to the health of our youth, our schools, and our nation. Students need to get plenty of sleep and physical activity, drink water, and eat good food to help them stay healthy in the winter and all year. Nearly 1/3 of the population is infected with flu every year. Influenza The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Influenza is a highly contagious virus that affects mainly the nose, throat, chest, and lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccination each year. Symptoms of Influenza Symptoms of i nfluenza include: Fever (typically 100\u00b0 F) Headache Extreme tiredness Dry cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle aches Stomach symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, also can occur but are more common in children than adults Emergency W arning Signs of Influenza In children , emergency warning signs that need urgent medical attention include: Fast breathing or trouble breathing Bluish skin color Not drinking enough fluids Not waking up or not interacting Being so irritable that the child does not want to be held Flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough Fever with a rash Infectious Period People may be able to infect each other one day before symptoms occur and up to ten days after being sick. How can you prev ent the flu? The single best way to prevent the flu is to get vaccinated each year. There are two types of vaccines: The \"flu\" shot - an inactivated vaccine (containing killed virus) that is given with a needle. The flu shot is approved for use in people six months of age and older, including healthy people and people with chronic medical conditions. The nasal -spray flu vaccine (FluMist \u00ae) - a vaccine made with live, weakened flu viruses that do not cause the flu (sometimes called LAIV for \"Live Attenuated I nfluenza Vaccine\". LAIV is approved for use in healthy people 2 -49 years of age who are not pregnant. Reviewed 10/12 Recommendations for Schools For more information on influenza visit our website at : www.idph.state.ia.us/Cade/Influenza.aspx?pg=FluHome . Iowa Department of Public Health About two weeks after vaccination, antibodies develop that protect against influenza virus infection. Flu vaccines will not protect against flu- like illn esses caused by non- influenza viruses. If you get the flu: Stay home from work or school Make sure and get plenty of rest and water Over -the-counter medications may relieve symptoms Consult your doctor Vaccination Yearly flu vaccination should begin early in the fall and provide protection for the entire flu season. Who should get vaccinated? In general, anyone who wants to reduce the chances of getting the flu can get vaccinated. However, certain people should get vaccinated each year either because they are at high risk of having serious flu- related complications or because they live with or care for high risk persons. During flu seasons when vaccine supplies are limited or delayed, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) makes recom mendations regarding priority groups for vaccination. People who fall into high risk categories for influenza complications and transmission include: Children aged six months up until their 19 th birthday Pregnant women People 50 years of age and older People of any age with certain chronic medical conditions People who live in nursing homes and other long- term care facilities People who live with or care for those at high risk for complications from flu, including: Health care workers Household contacts of persons at high risk for complications from the flu Household contacts and out -of-home caregivers of children less than six months of age (these children are too young to be vaccinated) The Nasal Spray Vaccination Vaccination with the nasal spray flu vaccine (FluMist \u00ae) is an option for healthy people ages 2- 49 years who are not pregnant, even healthy persons who live with or care for those in a high risk group. The one exception is healthy persons who care for persons with severely weakened immune systems who require a protected environment; these healthy persons should get the inactivated vaccine. What should be done to prevent or reduce the spread of influenza in schools? Stay home when ill. Any employee, student, teacher, or staff suspected of having influenza should not attend school. Wash hands often. Wash hands several times a day using soap and warm water for 15- 20 seconds (this is generally around the time it takes to sing the ABC's). Dry hands with paper towels or automatic hand dryers if possible. In school, allow regular breaks for the students and teachers to wash hands. Young children should be instructed and assisted to ensure proper hand hygiene. Restrooms should be checked regularly to ensure that soap and paper towels are always ava ilable. Throw away tissues. Influenza can be spread from coughs or sneezes. Make sure tissues are available in all classrooms. Students and staff should cover their mouths with their upper arm or a tissue when coughing and use a tissue when sneezing or blowing their noses. Tissues should be thrown away immediately followed by proper hand hygiene. Use alcohol -based hand sanitizer. Alcohol -based hand gels may be used in classrooms to minimize disruption. Hand sanitizer is effective in killing germs on hands when they are not visibly soiled. Appropriate times to use hand sanitizer are after coughing, sneezing, or contact with infected surfaces (e.g., desk, doorknob). Reviewed 10/12 Recommendations for Schools For more information on influenza visit our website at : www.idph.state.ia.us/Cade/Influenza.aspx?pg=FluHome . Iowa Department of Public Health Report absence 10 percent or greater. Schools with 10 percent or more of their total enrollment absent on a given day due to illness should report this to their local health department and the Iowa Department of Public Health (1- 800-362-2736). Reporting outbreaks assists in disease surveillance and understanding the impact of influenza on the c ommunity. It is not necessary to cancel school due to influenza cases. Closure of individual schools in the event of an outbreak has not proven to be an effective way of stopping the spread of influenza but that decision should be made by the appropriate school officials based on other considerations. Avoid close contact. Schools should be extra- vigilant that ill students be excluded from sports activities, choir or any activities that may involve close contact, since transmission of influenza may be eas ier in these situations. All students and staff should avoid sharing of saliva, i.e., sharing glasses, water bottles, other drinks, spoons/forks, or kissing, etc. Don't forget about the school bus. School buses, because of the enclosed space, may allow for easy spread of influenza. Tissues should be available on the buses, and students should be encouraged to cover nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing. Disinfect commonly handled interior surfaces (i.e., door handles, hand rails, etc.) between groups of students, if possible. Consider making alcohol -based hand gel available on buses since hand washing facilities are not available. Clean surfaces frequently. In the school, clean commonly used surfaces such as door handles, handrails, eating surfaces, desks, etc., frequently with disinfectant (bleach solutions or commercial disinfectants are appropriate).

Agent Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by the spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. B. Clinical Description Symptoms: consist of nonspecific const itutional symptoms of fever, chills, headache, severe muscle pain (calves and thighs), conjuctival suffusion (red, watery eyes), and malaise. Gastrointestinal tract symptoms and a rash can also occur. Asymptomatic infections can occur, and disease severity depends on the infecting serotype. Onset: is usually abrupt with symptoms listed above. Complications: Subsequently, the patient can have hepatic involvement (abnormal liver function tests, enlargement of the liver, jaundice, and liver failure), renal involvement (abnormal urinalysis, presence of nitrogen -containing compounds in the blood, and renal failure), cardiovascular involvement (hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage into skin and mucous membranes, and myocarditis), pulmonary involvement (with or without coughing up of blood), and central nervous system involvement (aseptic meningitis and altered mental awareness). Inflammation of certain muscle groups is common. Conjunctival suffusion, the most characteristic physical f inding, occurs in about 30% of patien ts. C. Reservoirs Common reservoirs : Wild and domestic animals are the reservoir for leptospirosis. Many animals have prolonged leptospiruria without suffering from the disease themselves. The infection is common in rodents, livestock (cattle, horses, sheep, goats, swine), canines, and wild mammals. D. Modes of Transmission Spread: is by direct or indirect contact of nasal, oral, or eye mucosal membranes or abraded or traumatized skin with urine or carcasses of infected animals. Urine: Indirect exposure throug h water, soil, or foods contaminated by urine from infected animals is the most common route. After a short period of circulating high levels of the spirochete in their blood, animals shed the spirochete in their urine, contaminating the environment. Inhal ation of droplet aerosols of contaminated fluids can occasionally occur. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Leptospirosis 1 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Person -to-person: transmission is rare . E. Incubation period The incubation period is usually 5-14 days, with range of 2- 30 days F. Period of Communicability or Infectious Period Person- to-person transmission is considered extremely rare. Infected animals can spread the disease during the leptospiruria phase, which can be prolonged (1 3 months or longer). Humans with leptospirosis usually excrete the organism in urine for 4 - 6 weeks, b ut leptospiruria has been observed in humans and in animals for as long as 11 months after acute infection G. Epidemiology In the United States, 100 200 cases of leptospirosis are identified annually, with about 50% of the cases occurring in Hawaii. The disease is considered to be under- diagnosed. Although the incidence of disease in the United States is relatively low, leptospirosis is considered to be the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world, particularly in tropical areas with heavy rainfall and neutral or alkaline soils. The greatest numbers of cases are seen in the summer months after heavy rainfalls or periods of flooding. Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals (for example, farmers, sewer workers , veterinarians, fish workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel). It is a recreational hazard for campers or those who participate in outdoor sports in contaminated areas, and it has been associated with swimming, wading, and whitewater rafting in contaminated lakes, farm ponds and rivers. Outbreaks have been associated with triathlons in the Midwest and extreme sports contests in Asia. H. Bioterrorism Potential None. 2) DISEASE REPORTING AND CASE INVESTIGATION A. Purpose of Surveillance and Reporting To assess the magnitude of the disease in different areas and among different risk groups. To assess need for prophylaxis after high -risk exposures. To identify outbreaks as soon as possible. To identify animal sources of infection. To design more effectiv e control or prevention methods. To assure proper diagnosis and treatment of those affected. B. Laboratory and Healthcare Provider Reporting Requirements Iowa Administrative Code 641 -1.3(139) stipulates that the laboratory and the health care provider must r eport outbreaks due to leptospirosis . The reporting number for IDPH Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology (CADE) is (800) 362 -2736 Laboratory Testing Services Available The University of Iowa State Hygienic Laboratory (SHL) tests single serum samples for Leptospirosis utilizing agglutination. The Hygienic Laboratory will forward specimens to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for additional testing. Accurate information about date of collection, date of onset of symptoms, travel history, vaccination and disease history are essential for test interpretation. For additional information on submitting samples or testing, contact the State Hygienic Laboratory at (319) 335 -4500.

Forms can be completed by interviewing the case and others who may be able to provide pertinent information. Most of the information required can be obtained from the healthcare provider or the medical record. c. Use the fo llowing guidelines to assist in completing the investigation : 1) Record \"Leptospirosis\" as the disease being reported. 2) Record the case's demographic information. 3) Record the date of symptom onset, symptoms, date of diagnosis, hospitalization information (if applicable ), and outcome of disease ( e.g., recovered, died). 4) Exposure history: use the incubation period range for leptospirosis (4 19 days). Specifically, focus on the period beginning a minimum of 4 days prior to the case's onset date back to no more than 19 days before onset for the following exposures: a) Travel history: determine the date(s) and geographic area(s) traveled to by the case. b) Animal contact: ask the case about potential direct or indirect occupational or recreational exposures to animals. This inform ation can then be documented in the \"Comments\" section. 5) Complete the import status section to indicate where leptospirosis was acquired. If unsure, check \"Unknown.\" Include any additional comments regarding the case. 6) If several attempts have been made to obtain case information, but have been unsuccessful ( e.g., the case or healthca re provider does not return calls or respond to a letter, or the case refuses to divulge information or is too ill to be interviewed), please fill out the form with as much infor mation as has been gathered.

A common vehicle, such as contaminated water, should be sought and applicable preventive or control measures instituted. Consult with CADE at (800) 362 - 2736. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Leptospirosis 3 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting D. Preventive Measures Environmental Measures To prevent illness, prevent contamination of living, working and recreational areas by uri ne of infected animals. Control rodent populations in areas of human habitation. Domestic animal owners should take necessary precautions to minimize their animal's potential contact with wildlife ( e.g., do not feed pets outside or allow animals to roam un supervised). Do not allow animals to urinate in or near ponds or pools. Keep animals away from gardens, playgrounds, sandboxes, and other places children may play. Among domesticated animals, vaccination of swine, cattle, and dogs is effective in preventin g symptoms of disease, but it does not protect completely against infection and shedding of organisms in the urine. Preventive Measures/Education To prevent leptospirosis, the public may need to be educated on how the disease is transmitted and the import ance of proper food storage and garbage disposal. The public should also be counseled to minimize their contact with fresh water, mud, and vegetation that might be contaminated with the urine of infected animals. If their occupation or recreational activities require such exposure, education on use of personal protective measures ( i.e., proper clothing, footwear and gloves) should be given. Additional preventive measures include: Always wash hands thoroughly after touching items potentially soiled by an animal's urine. Use an antibacterial cleaning solution or a solution of 1 part bleach in 100 parts water to clean areas or items soiled by the animal's urine. Doxycycline is effective post -exposure prophylaxis (200 mg/once a week) and should be considered for high-risk occupational groups during periods of high exposure. (See Section 1)G. at the beginning of this chapter for examples of high -risk occupations.) However, indications for doxycycline use in children have not been established. There is no licensed vaccine to prevent leptospirosis in humans. 4) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) surveillance case definition s for Leptospirosis can be found at : www.cdc.gov/osels/ph_surveillance/nndss/phs/infdis.htm#top CSTE case definitions should not affect the investigation or reporting of a case that fulfills the criteria in this chapter.

Leptospirosis is an infection caused by several strains of a bacterium called Leptospira. What are the symptoms of leptospirosis? The symptoms can be fever, headache, and severe m uscle pain, fatigue, chills, jaundice, and anemia, sometimes rash and gastrointestinal upset. Less frequently, it can result in meningitis (swelling of the covering of the brain), liver and kidney dysfunction, and eye inflammation. Severe cases are more common in older individuals and can result in death. How soon do symptoms appear? The symptoms usually start 5 -14 days after exposure, with a range of 2-30 days. How is leptospirosis spread? Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, horses, swine, rodents, and deer) are susceptible to leptospirosis and can excrete the bacteria in their urine. The urine can then contaminate water, moist soil, or vegetation with the Leptospira bacterium. Humans can acquire the infection if this co ntaminated material contacts broken skin, mucous membranes, or is swallowed. Because infected humans can also pass the bacteria in their urine, person -to-person transmission is possible but rarely occurs. Who gets leptospirosis infection? Although all pe rsons are susceptible, this uncommon infection occurs mainly in persons whose occupation brings them into contact with animals or with material contaminated with animal urine. Farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, sewer workers, and miners are a t greater risk of exposure. Although very rare, exposures can also occur during recreational activities such as camping or swimming, when there may be contact with or ingestion of contaminated water. Leptospirosis occurs most often in the summer and in warm climates. How long is a person infectious? Direct transmission from human to human is rare, but the bacteria can be found in urine as long as 11 months after illness. How is leptospirosis diagnosed? The diagnosis can be made by growing the Leptospira bacterium from body fluids, or by finding elevated levels of antibodies to the bacterium in a person's blood. Can a person get leptospirosis more than once? There are several strains of the organism. Infection with one usually provides immunity to that organism but not to other strains; therefore a person could get leptospirosis from a different strain of Leptospira . What is the treatment for this illness? The antibiotics of choice are penicillin or doxycycline. Kidney dialysis may be necessary. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or child care? No. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Leptospirosis Fact Sheet 1 What can be done to help prevent the spread of this disease? For persons in high -risk occupations, the use of protective clothing, boots, and gloves will minimize exposure. R ecognizing and avoiding potentially contaminated water and soil during recreational activities, and rodent control in areas where human and domestic animals live can also reduce the risk of exposure. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Leptospirosis Fact Sheet 2 FACT SHEET LICE (Pediculosis or Head lice) What are lice? Lice are small insects that live in the hairy parts of the body. The eggs (nits), larvae, or adult lice are visible if present on the head or body. Lice move by crawling, they cannot hop or fly. Lice feed on human blood by biting , which can result in severe itching. Are there different types of lice? Yes, there are three different types of lice that may infest humans. 1) Head lice are found on the scalp 2) Pubic lice (crabs) are found in the groin ( pubic) area 3) Body lice can be found in clothing, especially along inside seams that touch the body. This fact sheet specifically addresses head lice. What are the symptoms of head lice infestation? \"Tickling \" or feeling of something moving in the hair. Itching, caused by an allergic reaction to the bites of the head louse. Irritability and difficulty sleeping; head lice are most active in the dark. Sores on the head caused by scratching. These sores can sometimes become infected with bacteria found on the person's skin. How long after head lice infestation will symptoms to start? People with head lice may not have any symptoms , especially if this is the first time they have had head lice. Itchin g is the most common symptom of head lice and is caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites. It may take four to six weeks for itching to appear the first time a person has head lice. Where on the head and scalp are head lice most commonly found? Head lice and head lice nits are found almost exclusively on the scalp, particularly around and behind the ears and near the neckline at the back of the head. Head lice or head lice nits sometimes are found on the eyelashes or eyebrows but this is uncommon. Head lice hold tightly to hair with hook -like claws at the end of each of their six legs; head lice nits are cemented firmly to the hair shaft and can be difficult to remove. How are head lice spread? Head- to-head contact with an already infested person i s the most common way to get head lice. o Head- to-head contact is common during play at school, at home, and elsewhere (sports activities, playground, slumber parties, camp). Rarely , head lice are spread by sharing clothing or belongings onto which lice or nits may have crawled or fallen. Examples include: o sharing clothing (hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms) or articles (hair ribbons, barrettes, combs, brushes, towels, stuffed animals) recently worn or used by an infested person; o or lying on a bed, couch, pillow, or carpet that has recently been in contact with an infested person. The risk of getting an infestation by a louse or nit that has fallen onto a carpet or furniture is very small. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not play a role in the spread of human lice. How are head lice treated ? The Iowa Department of Public Health recommends a 14- day treatment process. For a brochure detailing treatment recommendations, please visit: www.idph.state.ia.us/hcci/common/pdf/headlice_brochure.pdf Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Lice Fact Sheet 1 How effective are home remedies? Never use kerosene, gasoline, or other dangerous substances. There is no proof that use of mayonnaise, vinegar, various types of vegetable oils, Crisco, or Vaseline are effective forms of treatment. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or child care? No. For more information on IDPH recommendations for lice in schools, please visit: www.idph.state.ia.us/hcci/common/pdf/headlice_brochure.pdf What can be done to help prevent and control the spread of head lice? Avoid head- to-head (hair -to-hair) contact during play and other activities at home, school, and elsewhere (sports activities, playground, slumber parties, camp). Do not share clothing such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, hair ribbons, or barrettes Do not share combs, brushes, or towels. Disinfest combs and brushes used by an infest ed person by soaking them in hot water (at least 130\u00b0F) for 5- 10 minutes Do not lie on beds, couches, pillows, carpets, or stuffed animals that have recently been in contact with an infested person. Do not use fumigant sprays or fogs; they are not necessary to control head lice and can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Only ordinary house cleaning, vacuuming, and washing bedding and clothes in hot water are needed. No special efforts or sprays are needed to clean your home. Only dead or dying lice are found on clothing, bedding, or furniture. To help control a head lice outbreak in a community, school, or camp, children can be taught to avoid activities that may spread head lice. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Lice Fact Sheet 2 For more information visit our Web site at www.idph.state.ia.us/hcci/common/pdf/headlice_brochure.pdf Iowa Department of Public Health FACT SHEET LICE Information for Health Professionals (Pediculosis or Head lice) What are head lice? Lice are wingless insects that are host -adapted to humans and do not live on household pets or in the general environment. An adult head louse can live about 30 days on a person's head but will die within one or two days if it falls off a person. How are they transmitted? Lice do not fly or jump. Transmission is almost always through direct contact. Fomites and the environment are extremely infrequent sources. As a rule of thumb, over 95% are transmitted through person- to-person contact and less than 5% through indirect exposure. Lice are transmitted in community settings where close contact from play and living activities occur. While lice infestations are recognized in elementary schools, it is safe to assume that only a minority of lice infestations in school -age youngsters was actually acquired while at school. What are the risk factors for transmission? Small children at play are the primary setting for transmission. Increasing risk would also be associated with crowding, such as two families living in one dwelling or in a child- care center and any activity that brings youngsters together in informal settings such as sleep- overs, scouts, youth sports activities, etc. While schools are of lesser importance, best friends or playmates present risk from close associations at recess and during transportation such as in school buses. What is the best approach to screening? Screening requires a close visual examination of the individual's head for crawling lice and nits (eggs). A small hand lens may help but is not essential. Good lighting is desirable. Examine the hair and scalp for at least 15 minutes to be reasonably sure the child does not have head lice. Most individuals have fewer than 10 adult lice. The characteristic itching caused by lice may not develop for 30 days or longer after infestation. A flashlight or ultraviolet light may help in detecting lice or nits. Ideally parents should screen their own youngsters periodically, perhaps weekly, while they are in child- care or in the early grades at school. What is the best approach to treatment? The natural pyrethrins contained in over -the-counter products such as Rid, A -200 Pyrinate, Pronto, and various store brands are perhaps the best class of insecticide because they are effective on lice and are minimally toxic to humans. Lindane is not recommended because of its toxic potential and demonstrated lice resistance. The Iowa Department of Public Health recommends a 14- day treatment process. For a brochure detailing treatment recommendations, please visit: www.idph.state.ia.us/hcci/common/pdf/headlice_brochure.pdf . What causes treatment failure? The following are several common reasons why treatment for head lice may fail: Misdiagnosis. The symptoms are not caused by an active head lice infestation. Applying the treatment to hair that has been washed with conditioning shampoo or rinsed with hair conditioner. Conditioners can act as a barrier that keeps the head lice medicine from adhering to the hair shafts; this can reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. Not following following the treatment instructions carefully. Some examples of this are not applying a second treatment if instructed to do so, or retreating too soon after the first treatment before all the nits are hatched and the newly hatched head lice can be killed, or retreating too late after new eggs have already been deposited. Resistance of the head lice to the treatment used. The head lice may have become resistant to the treatment. Many strains of lice have developed resistance to the permethrin and lindane insecticides. Also, all products have minimal ovicidal (nit killing) activity so nits remain viable, resulting in nymphal lice emerging after treatment, thus a second treatment 7- 10 days later is recommended. Reinfestation. The person was treated successfully and the lice were eliminated, but then the person becomes infested again by lice spread from another infested person. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Lice Iowa Department of Public Health If the over -the-counter therapy continues to fail, the healthcare professional may wish to consider other prescription options (see the CDC website: www.cdc.gov/lice/head/treatment.html ) or \"extra Merck). Reference: \"Drugs for Head Lice,\" The Medical Letter On Drugs and Therapeutics 47: August 15/29, 2005. How effective are home remedies? Never use kerosene, gasoline, or other dangerous substances. There is no clear scientific evidence that use of mayonnaise, vinegar, various types of vegetable oils, Crisco, or Vaseline are effective forms of treatment. Is it necessary to remove all the nits? Removal of all nits after successful treatment with a pediculicide is not necessary to prevent further spread. Removal of nits after treatment with a pediculicide may be done for aesthetic reasons, or to reduce diagnostic confusion and the chance of unnecessary retreatment. Because pediculicides are not 100% ovicidal (i.e. , do not kill all the egg stages), some experts recommend the manual removal of nits that are attached within 1 cm of the base of the hair shaft. How important is the environment in lice transmission? Laundering of linens and vacuuming of upholstered furniture is more than adequate. Environm ental spraying should not be done. The pyrethrin sprays are not without risk and can aggravate the health problems of children with asthma. What can one do to prevent lice?

Not known to transmit disease Transmission Usually spread through sexual contact Treatment and Prevention Over the counter or prescription medications are available Characteristics common to all 3 types of lice : Dogs, cats, and other pets do not play a role in the transmission of any type of human lice. Lice move by crawling; they cannot hop or fly. Human lice survive by feeding on human blood. Differences between the 3 types of l ice: Size: o Pubic lice are the smallest and vary from 1.1- 1.8 mm in length. o Head lice are generally 2.1- 3.3 mm in length o Body lice are typically the largest and vary from 2.3- 3.6 mm in length Location: o Head lice are mainly found on the head and neck region. o Body lice are found on clothing and attach to the body only when feeding. o Pubic lice are found in the pubic hair or other course hair on the body. Transmission: o Head lice are transmitted through head to head contact or rarely through sharing hats, combs, towels , etc. o Body lice are transmitted through close contact and usually under un-sanitary or crowded conditions . o Pubic lice are transmitted mainly through sexual contact. Treatment: o Varies from over-the-counter and prescription medication in head and public lice to practicing good hygiene and maintaining a clean environment in body lice .

School nurses may spend a disproportion ate amount of their time addressing head lice issues considering that they pose no health hazard. The Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) recommends the following prevention and control measures for managing head lice in Iowa schools. 1. Discontinue routine school -based screening. Current evidence does not support classroom or school -wide screening as a method to stop head lice transmission. Instead, schools should educate parents and staff about lice detection, treatment, and prevention. P arents should be encouraged to regularly scree n their children for lice. It should be assumed that head lice are in the community and schools at all times. 2. Discontinue \"no nit\" policies. \"No-nits\" policies that require a child to be free of nits before they can return to school are not recommended. Children should not be excluded from school . Head lice can be a nuisance but have not been shown to spread disease. 3. Children should remain in school for the rest of the day if head lice are detected. Notify parents by phone, provide educational materials on treatment, and review treatment protocols. It is reasonable to expect that treatment be started before the child returns to school the next day . 4. Do not use environmental sprays or chemical cleaners at home or in the classrooms, lockers, or on gym mats or other school equipment. Head lice do not live \"off\" the body. The head louse must maintain a constant warm temperature. Only ordinary cleaning, vacuuming, and washing in hot water are needed. Do not use chemical sprays on such items as audio/video headsets, tables or mats, carpet, upholst ered chairs, sch ool bus benches, or bed linens . Sprays and other chemicals can be potentially harmful, since they can be absorbed through the skin and are irritating to the lungs of some asthmatics. 5. Teach and support parents in appropriate techniques fo r lice treatment. The Iowa D epartment of Public Health advocates a two- week treatment plan that includes the use of an over -the-counter medicated shampoo which contains either permethrin or a pyrethrin. A handout for parents from the IDPH can be found at www.idph.state.ia.us/hcci/common/pdf/headlice_brochure.pdf 6. What if tr eatment with over -the-counter shampoos and use of a nit comb fails? Physicians may prescribe stronger treatments for head lice. Re-infestation is more common than treatment failure. 7.

It is a viral illness caused by the Epstein -Barr virus (EBV). What are the symptoms mononucleosis? They include fever, sore throat, swollen glands and a feeling of tiredness, which usually last for several weeks. Very young children may not develop any symptoms after infection. How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms appear 4 to 6 weeks after contracting the virus. How is mononucleosis spread? It is spread from person -to-person by direct saliva contact (by sharing food or drink, or saliva on the hands of young children or toys, or by kissing. The virus may rarely be spread by blood transfusion. Who gets mononucleosis? Most people are infected with EBV sometime in their lives, but very few become ill. In the United States, illness usually occurs in older children, high school and college students. How long is a person infectious? The virus is carried in the throat and can be spread during the illness and for a s long as a year afterward. What is the treatment for mononucleosis ? No treatment other than rest is needed for most cases; persons with very hoarse (swollen) throats should see their doctor. Can a person get mononucleosis again? People who have had mononucleosis do not usually get it again. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or day care? No. What can be done to help prevent the spread of mononucleosis? Avoid contact with the body fluids (commonly saliva) of someone who is infe cted with the virus. At present, no vaccine is available to prevent mononucleosis.

State Hygienic Laboratory (S HL) is the only laboratory in the state that can test for Noroviruses. Lab: Report all potential outbreaks; send stool specimens with specific request f or norovirus testing. State Hygienic Laboratory (SHL) is the only laboratory in the state that can test for Noroviruses. Physicians: Report all potential outbreaks , Local Public Health Agency (LPHA): Report all potential outbreaks of norovirus , send stool specimens with specific request for norovirus testing. Iowa Department of Public Health Disease Reporting Hotline: (800) 362- 2736 Secu re Fax: (515) 281 -5698 1) THE AND ITS EPIDEMIOLOGY A. Agent Noroviruses (genus Norovirus , family Caliciviridae ) are a group of related, single -strand RNA, nonenveloped viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis in humans. Norovirus was recently approved as the official genus name for the group of viruses formerly described as \"Norwalk -like viruses\" (NLV), or \"small round viruses.\" B. Clinical Description Symptoms: The symptoms of norovirus illness usually include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and some stomach cramping. Sometimes people have a low -grade fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and a general sense of fatigue. The illness often begins suddenly, and the infected person may feel very sick. The illness is usually brief, with symptoms lasting only about 1 - 2 days. In general, children experience more vomiting than adults. Onset: Symptoms of norovirus illness usually begin about 24 - 48 hours after ingestion of the virus, but they can appear as early as 12 hours after exposure. Comp lications : Dehydration may result in persons with norovirus disease, which may require hospitalization. There are no known long -term effects . C. Reservoirs Humans are the only known reservoir. D. Modes of Transmission Noroviruses are very cont agious and spread easily from person to person. It is believed that an inoculum of as few as 10 viral particles may be sufficient to infect another individual. Norovirus may be transmitted in a variety of ways: Iowa Dep t. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Norovirus 1 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Surveillance most commonly through the fecal -oral route, either by consumption of fecally contaminated food or water or by direct person -to-person spread by environmental and fomite contamination acting as a source of infection by transmission due to aerosolization of vomitus that presumably results in droplet s contaminating surfaces or entering the oral mucosa and being swallowed. E. Incubation period The symptoms of norovirus appear about 24 - 48 hours after ingestion of the virus, but can appear as early as 12 hours after exposure. F. Period of Communicability or Infectious Period People infected with norovirus can be contagious from the moment they begin feeling ill , until several days after symptoms end. The virus can be shed for two weeks or more after recovery, although it is unclear whether virus shedding during this time is infectious. Infected people do not become long - term carriers of norovirus. G. Epidemiology Norovirus is common worldwide, and is mostly associated with sporadic outbreaks. All age groups are affected. Of the 232 outbreaks of norovirus illness reported to CDC from July 1997 to June 2000, 57% were foodborne, 16% were due to person -to-person spread, and 3% were waterborne. Twenty -three percent of the outbreaks did not have a determined single vehicle of transmission, probably because multiple foods were contaminated. In this study, common settings for outbreaks included restaurants and catered meals (36%), nursing homes (23%), schools (13%), and vacation settings or cruise ships (10%). In Iowa, noroviruses cause the majority of foodborne illness outbreaks. Rough, wet, uncooked foods are at highest risk of transmission. Most foodborne outbreaks of norovirus illness arise from direct contamination of food by those who handle the food before it is eaten. Outbreaks have frequently been associated with consumption of cold foods, including salads, sa ndwiches, and bakery products. There have been also been outbr eaks associated with persons vomiting and aerosolizing virus in public settings . Waterborne outbreaks of norovirus have been caused by sewage contamination of wells and recreational water. Diapered children playing in \"kiddie\" pools filled with tap water (pools that have not been chlorinated) have also been ass ociated with norovirus outbreaks. H. Bioterroris m Potential None. 2) DISEASE REPORTING AND CASE INVESTIGATION A. Purpose of Surveillance and Reporting To determine the cause of illness To implement appropriate disease control measures B. Laboratory and Healthcare Provider Reporting Require ments Iowa Administrative Code 641 -1.3(139) stipulates that the laboratory and the healthcare provider must immediately report suspected or confirmed outbreaks. The reporting number for IDPH Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology (CADE) is (800) 362 - 2736. Iowa Dep t. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Norovirus 2 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Surveillance To reach CADE after business hours, call the Iowa State Patrol Dispatch Office at (515) 323- 4360. They will page a member of the on -call CADE staff. Laboratory Testing Services Available The University of Iowa State Hygienic Laboratory (SHL) performs PCR testing for Norovirus . The preferred spec imen is stool . Stool specimens should be collected in a clean collection container for transport. o It is best to not have stool specimens in Cary Blair medium when testing for norovirus . Specimens should be sh ipped with ice packs (not wet ice). Specimens should be sent by overnight delivery, and the lab notified of their expected arrival time. Samples are best collected within two days after onset of symptoms, but may be tested up to one week after the onset of symptoms. A completed non -respiratory disease laboratory requisition form (found at www.shl.uiowa.edu/kitsquotesforms/ is required. o A contact person and telephone number must be included a long with a brief explanation of the reason for sending the specimens (e.g., suspected foodborne outbreak at School, in Atro City, IA). For additional information contact the SHL at (319) 335-4500. If stool specimens are sent to a laboratory using typical clinic/hospital procedures, tests for norovirus will not be performed. If norovirus testing is indicated, specimens should be sent to S HL. C. Local Public Health Agency Follow -up Responsibilities Case Investigation: Individual norovirus infectio ns are not reportable. Disease reporting reg ulations require that suspected or confirmed outbreaks, including norovirus, be reported to local public health agencies by the most rapid means available within 24 hours. When an outbreak is first reported, th e disease -causing agent and specific exposure may not be known. o An investigation is initiated to identify the causative organism and source of illness, with the goal of preventing further spread. o Investigation should begin as soon as the outbreak is identified. o Since this illness is mild, cases may not seek medical care. o The LPHA may be responsible for collecting stool specimens. 3) CONTROLLING FURTHER SPREAD A. Isolation and Quarantine Requirements Standard and Contact Precautions should be take n when caring for diapered or incontinent persons for the duration of illness or to control institutional outbreaks. B. Protection of Contacts of a Case Freque nt and thorough handwashing Cleaning contaminated surfaces, including carpets. Iowa Dep t. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Norovirus 3 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Surveillance C. Managing Special Situations Child care General recommendations for prevention of norovirus spread in child care settings include: Children with suspected or confirmed norovirus infection who have diarrhea or are vomiting should be excluded until 24 hours after both diarrhea and vomiting have ceased. Most staff members in child care programs would be considered food handlers. o Child care staff members who handle food and have diarrhea and/or vomiting must be excluded from food handling duties until 48 hours aft er their diarrhea and vomiting cease. o Child care staff can go back to non -food handling activities 24 hours after dia rrhea and vomiting have ceased. Child care staff members who do not handle food should be excluded until 24 hours after diarrhea and vomit ing have ceased. Educate c hild care staff members , parents, and children on proper hand washing technique. o There is scientific uncertainty over the effectiveness of alcohol -based hand gels against norovirus. o Thus, IDPH always recommends washing hands with soap and warm water . o Alcohol based hand gels should only be used in situations where soap and warm water are not available. During norovirus outbreaks in child care settings, consider the general guidance listed above, as well as, the following r ecommendations. Consider providing notification (i.e. send letter, post a notice) on norovirus and recommendation s for how parents, staff, and children can prevent spread of the disease. o Refer to IDPH Parent Letter for Child care Center Norovirus Outbreaks . Increase frequency of routine cleaning. o Examples of areas to disinfect include: doorknobs, fountains, sinks, toilets, phones, counters, desks, handrails, and light switches. o Toys should be cleaned and disinfected daily. o Refer to IDPH Norovirus Environmental Cleaning Fact Sheet for appropriate cleaning methods. Ensure restrooms are adequately stocked with soap, paper towels , and warm running water. Local public health agencies should request stool specimen s from 3-5 of the ill individuals to send to SHL to confirm the cause of the outbreak. Cohorting ill and well children may be indicated in special circumstances; contact CADE for consultation prior to making this decision . School General recommendations for prevention of norovirus spread in school settings include: Students and staff with suspected or confirmed norovirus infection who have diarrhea or are vomiting should be excluded until 24 hours a fter both vomiting and diarrhea have ceased . Any staff (or students who may assist with f ood preparation or serving) who handle s food and has diarrhea and / or vomiting must be excluded from food handling activities until 48 hours after diarrhea and vomiting have ceased. o Staff can go back to non -food handling activities 24 hours after diarrh ea and vomiting have ceased.

Temporarily stop using self service foods for school breakfast/lunch. Ensure restrooms are adequately stocked with soap, paper towels, and warm running water. Local public health agencies should request stool specimens from 3-5 of the ill individuals to send to SHL to confirm the cause of the outbreak. Community Residential Programs Actions taken in response to a norovirus outbreak in a community residential program will depend on the type of program and the level of functioning of the residents. General recommendations for the prevention of disease spread include: Residents with suspected or confirmed norovirus should be placed on enteric precautions until their symptom s subside . Staff members with suspected or confirmed norovirus infection should not work unti l 24 hours after vomiting and diarrhea have ceased. Staff and clients with suspected or confirmed norovirus must refrain from handling or preparing food for othe r residents until 48 hours after vomiting or diarrhea has stopped. Educate staff members, residents, and visitors on proper hand washing technique. o There is scientific uncertainty over the effectiveness of alcohol -based hand gels against norovirus. o Thus, IDPH always recommends washing hands with soap and warm water. o Alcohol based hand gels should only be used in situations where soap and warm water are not available. Consult CADE at (800) 362 -2736 regarding additional actions that can be considered during outbreak s in community residential programs. Hospital and Long -term Care Facility Recommendations General recommendations for prevention of norovirus spread in hospital and long -term care facilities include: Place ill patients in private rooms or cohort ill patients in the same room. Consider grouping ill patients in the same area or wing of the facility. Minimize un -necessary movement of residents. Consider temporarily discontinuing group activities until the outbreak has resolved. Consid er serving meals in resident rooms versus the dining hall. Educate staff members, residents, and visitors on proper hand washing technique. Iowa Dep t. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Norovirus 5 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Surveillance o There is scientific uncertainty over the effectiveness of alcohol -based hand gels against norovirus. o Thus, I DPH always recommends washing hands with soap and warm water. o Alcohol based hand gels should only be used in situations where soap and warm water are not available. Send all ill staff home immediately. Staff should not return to duties for 24 hours f ollowing cessation of diarrhea and/or vomiting. o Education on proper hand hygiene should be emphasized upon return to work. Staff should wash their hands when entering and leaving every resident room. Patients with suspected norovirus infection should be managed with standard and contact precautions with careful attention to hand hygiene practices. Contact precautions should be used when caring for diapered or incontinent persons, during outbreaks in a facility, and when a splash could occur. Persons cleaning areas heavily contaminated with vomitus or feces should wear surgical masks. Food handlers who are ill with gastrointestinal symptoms SHOULD NOT prepare or serve food until 48 hours following cessation of diarrhea and/or vomiting. Educate staff memb ers, residents, and visitors on proper hand washing technique. o There is scientific uncertainty over the effectiveness of alcohol -based hand gels against norovirus. o Thus, IDPH always recommends washing hands with soap and warm water. o Alcohol based han d gels should only be used in situations where soap and warm water are not available. Medical equipment used for care of norovirus infected patients, should be either dedicated to that patient for the duration of patient's isolation or be thoroughly disin fected when removed from the patient's room. o Selection of appropriate cleaning agent should be consistent with the equipment manufacturer's recommendation for compatibility. o Refer to IDPH Norovirus Environmental Cleaning Fact Sheet for appropriate cle aning methods. During norovirus outbreaks in hospital and long -term care facilities, consider the general guidance listed above, as well as, the following recommendations. Collect stool specimens from 3 -5 residents/patients to confirm norovirus is the cause of the outbreak. Staff should be assigned to work with well residents or with sick residents, and should not care for both groups. o Staff who go back and forth between ill and well residents play an important role in transmitting the virus from resident to resident. Limit staff from moving between affected and unaffected areas or units of the facility and limit any nonessential personnel from affected areas or units. o To the extent possible, keep staff from \"floating\" between areas or units. Consider limiting new admissions to the affected areas or units until all patients are well and no new cases are occurring. Inform visitors about a possible disease outbreak in your facility. o Consider limiting or stopping visitation to the facility until th ere have been no new cases for at least 48 hours. Post extra hand washing signs in various visible areas in the facility.

Preventive Measures Environmental Measures Implicated food items should be removed from the environment. A decision about testing implicated food items should be made in consultation with the Department of Inspections and Appeals , CADE , and the SHL. The general policy of the S HL is to test only food samples implicated in suspected outbreaks, not in single cases (except in unusual circumstances). If individuals want food tested that does not meet these criteria, refer them to a commercial laboratory, where they will be responsible for payment. The Department of Inspections and Appeals (DIA), or their cont racted agency, will facilitate additional environmental investigations at restaurants or food processors that they regulate. Preventive Measures/Education There is scientific uncertainty over the effectiveness of alcohol -based hand gels against norovirus. Thus, IDPH always recommends washing hands with soap and warm water. Alcohol based hand gels should only be used in situations where soap and warm water are not available. The following preventive steps should be encouraged to decrease the risk of co ntracting and spreading noroviruses: Wash hands frequently, especially after using the toilet or changing diapers (wash the child's hands after diapering too), and before eating or preparing food. Carefully wash fruits and vegetables. Steam or otherwise cook oysters before eating them. Thoroughly clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces immediately after an episode of illness using a solution of 1/4 cup bleach per gallon of water, or other household cleaner. Immediately remove and wash clothing or line ns that may be contaminated with virus after an episode of illness. Flush or discard vomitus and/or stool in the toilet, and make sure the surrounding area is kept clean. See Fact Sheet - Norovirus Environmental Cleaning for detailed information. Persons who are infected with norovirus should not prepare food until 48 hours after the last bout of vomiting or diarrhea. 4) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION References CDC website: www.cdc.gov/norovirus/ Heymann, D.L., ed. Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, 18th Edition. Washington, DC, American Public Health Association, 2004. Iowa Dep t. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Norovirus 7 Fact Sheet Environmental Cleaning NOROVIRUS Noroviruses are a group of viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis in humans. The symptoms of norovirus infection include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and low -grade fever. Noroviruses are transmitted through the fecal -oral route, either by consumption of fecally contaminated food or water, direct person -to-person spread, or environmental and fomite contamination. Maintaining a clean environment is important in containing and preventing the spread of norovirus! What are examples of items to disinfect? Doorknobs, faucets, sinks, toilets, commodes, bath rails, phones, counters, chairs (including backs), tables, hand rails, elevator buttons, light switches, mattress covers, aprons, uniforms, linens, bedding, ice machines, and over -bed tables in patient rooms. What disinfectant works best? Chlorine bleach solution (sodium hypochlorite -NaOCl) Chlorine Bleach Concentrations and Mixing Instructions Concentration: 200 ppm (parts p er million) 1000 ppm (parts per million) 5000 ppm (parts per million) Use for: Stainless steel, food/mouth contact items, toys Non-porous surfaces, tile floors, counter - tops, sinks, toilets Porous surfaces, wooden floors Mixing: 1 tbsp of bleach in 1 - gallon water 1/3 cup bleach in 1 - gallon water 1 2/3 cups bleach in 1 - gallon water Dilution: 1:250 dilution 1:50 dilution 1:10 dilution Leave bleach on surface for 10 -20 minutes, and then rinse with clean water. What is the stability of chlorine ble ach? Open bottles of concentrated chlorine will lose effectiveness after 30 days. Change bottles of bleach every 30 days for accurate concentrations. For disinfecting, use an unopened bottle of chlorine bleach. Prepare a dilution of fresh bleach every da y of use and discard unused portions. What are other effective disinfectants against norovirus? Glutaraldehyde (0.5%) or Iodine (0.8%) mixed at the manufacturer's recommendations. A phenolic environmental disinfectant (Lysol\u00ae or Pinesol\u00ae) may be effec tive, but may require 2- 4 times more concentration than the manufacturer's recommendation. The use of this product at the higher concentration may pose a significant health risk to workers, pets or yourself. Use extreme caution when using these products. P lease read the manufacturer's warning. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi ewed 10/12 Norovirus Environmental Cleaning Fact Sheet 1 What disinfectants against norovirus? Quaternary compounds ( Benzalkonium chloride) , Ethanol, or anionic compounds. What are the health concerns with using chlorine bleach? Mixing hazards USE ONLY IN WELL -VENTILATED AREAS. Adverse effects of inappropriate mixtures of household cleaners usually are caused by prolonged exposure to an irritant gas in a poorly ventilated area. The most common inappropriate mixtures of cleaning agents are bleach with acids (like vinegar) or ammonia ( e.g. Windex \u00ae). Potential irritants released from such mixtures are chlorine gas, chloramines, and ammonia gas. Health hazards Chlorine bleach is corrosive and irritating to all mucosal tissue, skin, eyes and upper an d lower respiratory tract. Avoid spray bottle application with any disinfectant. What personal protective equipment should be worn? Disposable gloves, masks, eye protection or face shields, and gown or protective clothing. Environmental cleaning using a more concentrated disinfectant will require a heavier duty glove than a simple non -sterile latex/vinyl glove. Are there any specific clean -up procedures? For cleaning large spills of vomitus or stool, a two- step process should be used: 1. Visible/orga nic debris should be cleaned up with absorbent material (double layer) and discarded in a plastic bag to minimize aerosols. 2. Disinfect area and objects surrounding the vomitus or stool with an appropriate environmental disinfectant (multiple application s may be required). Ensure appropriate dilution and contact time for the appropriate environmental disinfectant. Hard surfaces Disinfect with bleach solution , rinse with water if this is a food preparation area. Carpet / Upholstered Furniture Visible debris should be cleaned with absorbent material (double layer) and discarded in a plastic bag to minimize aerosols - disinfecting with bleach may discolor carpet - steam clean (heat inactivation) 158\u00b0F for 5 minutes or 212\u00b0F for 1 minute for complete inactivation. Linens / clothing / textiles If soiled, vomit or stool should be carefully removed to minimize aerosols. Aerosols created may pose a risk for transmission. Keep contaminated and uncontaminated clothes separated. Minimize disruption of soile d linens and laundry. Wash items in a pre -wash cycle, then use a regular wash cycle using detergent and dried at a high temperature greater than 170\u00b0F. Surfaces corrodible/damageable by bleach Use EPA registered phenolic solutions (concentrated Lyso l\u00ae or concentrated Pinesol\u00ae) mixed at 2- 4 times the manufacturer's recommended concentration. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi ewed 10/12 Norovirus Environmental Cleaning Fact Sheet 2 FACT SHEET NOROVIRUS What is norovirus? Noroviruses are a large group of viruses, also called small round viruses. Many of the viruses are named for the locale where they were first id entified as causing an outbreak . Norovirus is the most common ca use of foodborne illness (diarrhea and vomiting) in the U.S. What are the symptoms of infection with norovirus? The most common symptoms are nausea with vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps. People of all ages have these symptoms. Diarrhea is more common amon g adults; vomiting is more common in children. Many persons (25% to 50%) also experience headache, fever, chills and muscle aches. Illness usually lasts 24 -48 hours. There are no known long-term e ffects. How soon do symptoms appear? The symptoms may appear 12 - 48 hours after exposure to the virus, but onset may range from 10 -50 hours after exposure. How is norovirus spread? Norovirus are most commonly spread through the fecal -oral route, either by consumption of food or water contaminated with stool or by direct person -to-person spread. The virus can also be spread by contact with objects contaminated with stool and by spread ing in the air after someone vomits. This may result in droplets landing on surfaces or entering the mouth and being swallowed. Outbreaks of norovirus have been associated with both food and water. Food outbreaks have been linked to cold, prepared foods (salads, sandwiches) presumably contaminated by an infected food handler, or shellfish probably harvested from contaminated wa ter. Outbreaks have also been associated with drinking water and recreational water (swimmi ng ponds, beaches) where people have ingested contaminated water. Noroviruses are also spread from person to person, especially among family members. How long is a person infectious? People can pass the virus to others while sick, and up to 72 hours after diarrhea has stopped. How is norovirus diagnosed? It is possible to confirm norovirus in the laboratory. Noroviruses are suspected as the cause of illness if: 1. Stool tests are negative for other causes. 2. Ill individuals have vomiting and/or diarrhea. 3. The average time between exposure and illness is 24 - 48 hours. 4. The duration of illness for most persons is 12 - 60 hours (usually 24 - 48) 5. A stool test is positive for norovirus. What is the treatment for this illness? There is no specific treatment for norovirus. Rest and staying away from other people is important while symptoms occur. Usually, illness does not last more than 2 -3 days. What can be done to help prevent the spread of these viruses? It is best to identify the source of infection and remove the source (e.g. an infected food handler, contaminated food or water). Anyone who is ill with diarrhea, vomiting or fever shou ld not work with food, the elderly, in healthcare or child care. Anyone working in these occupations that becomes ill with these symptoms should leave work. Food recently prepared by this person should be discarded. Good handwashing should be encouraged at all times. Iowa Department of Public Health Revis ed 10/12 Norovirus 1 Iowa Department of Public Health Norovirus General & Outbreak Recommendations ____________________________________________________________________________________ School and Workplace Recommendations: General: Staff, students, or visitors with norovirus infection who have diarrhea should remain at home until 24 hours after diarrhea and/or vomiting cease, and until stools are formed. Education on proper hand hygiene should be emphasized upon return to work or school. Educate all students and staff on proper hand washing technique: Hand washing should be done using warm water and soap. Rub hands together for at least 15 seconds making sure to scrub the backs of hands, wrists, between fingers and under fingernails. Rinse well under warm water and use a paper towel or blow dryer to dry your hands. Food service workers, should not return to food handling duties for three days following cessation of diarrhea and/or vomiting, and until stools are formed. Students and staff who become ill while at school or the workplace should be sent home immediately. There has been uncertainty over the effectiveness of alcohol based hand gels against norovirus. IDPH always recommends washing hands. Alcohol based hand gels should only be used in situations where soap and warm water may not be available. Outbreak: Consider sending a letter home with students for parents that provides basic information on norovirus and recommendations on how they can help prevent spread of the disease. Refer to the sample IDPH Parent Letter for School Norovirus Outbreaks . Increase frequency of routine cleaning. Examples of areas to disinfect include: doorknobs, fountains, sinks, toilets, phones, counters, desks, handrails, and light switches. Toys should be cleaned and disinfected daily. Refer to IDPH Norovirus Environmental Cleaning Fact Sheet for appropriate cleaning methods. Temporarily stop using self- service foods for school breakfast/lunch. Ensure restrooms are adequately stocked with soap, paper towels, and warm running water. To determine and confirm the cause of the outbreak, local public health agencies may request stool specimens from some of the ill individuals. Childcare Center Recommendations: General: Ill children not in diapers and child care center staff with diarrhea and/or vomiting should remain at home until 24 hours after diarrhea and/or vomiting cease, and until stools are formed. Children in diapers should remain at home for 3 days following cessation of diarrhea and/or vomiting and until stools are formed. Education on proper hand hygiene should be emphasized upon return to the childcare center. Child care center staff that handle food should remain at home for 3 days following cessation of diarrhea and/or vomiting and until stools are formed. Proper hand washing technique: Hand washing should be done using warm water and soap. Rub hands together for at least 15 seconds making sure to scrub the backs of hands, wrists, between fingers and under fingernails. Rinse well under warm water and use a paper towel or blow dryer to dry your hands. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Norovirus General & Outbreak Recommendations 1 Iowa Department of Public Health There has been uncertainty over the effectiveness of alcohol based hand gels against norovirus. IDPH always recommends washing hands. Alcohol based hand gels should only be used in situatio ns where soap and warm water may not be available. Outbreak: Cohorting of ill and well children may be indicated in certain circumstances. LPHA or IDPH should be contacted to provide assistance in these situations. Consider sending a letter home with children for parents that provides basic information on norovirus and recommendations on how they can help prevent spread of the disease. Refer to the sample IDPH Parent Letter for Child care Center Norovirus Outbreaks . Increase frequency of routine cleaning. Examples of areas to disinfect include: doorknobs, fountains, sinks, toilets, phones, counters, desks, handrails, and light switches. Toys should be cleaned and disinfected daily. Refer to IDPH Norovirus Environmental Cleaning Fact Sheet for appropriate cleaning methods. Ensure restrooms are adequately stocked with soap, paper towels, and warm running water. To determine and confirm the cause of the outbreak, local public health agencies may request stool specimens from some ill children and staff. Hospital and Long -term Care Facility Recommendations: Patient/resident recommendations: General: Place ill patients in private rooms or in the same room or wing as other ill patients. Minimize movement of residents. Consider stopping all group activities (dining halls, activity rooms, etc.) until outbreak has resolved. Consider serving meals in resident rooms versus the dining hall. Staff recommendations: General: Ill staff that provide direct patient care, including food service workers should remain at home for 3 days following cessation of diarrhea and/or vomiting, and until stools are formed. Education on proper hand hygiene should be emphasized upon return to work. Staff that do not provide direct patient care should remain at home for at least 24 hours following cessation of diarrhea and/or vomiting, and until stools are formed. Education on proper hand hygiene should be emphasized upon return to work Staff should wash their hands when entering and l eaving every resident room. Patients with suspected norovirus infection should be managed with standard and contact precautions with careful attention to hand hygiene practices. Contact precautions should be used when caring for diapered or incontine nt persons, during outbreaks in a facility, and when a splash could occur. Persons cleaning areas heavily contaminated with vomitus or feces should wear surgical masks. Staff should be assigned to work with well residents or sick residents, but should not care for both groups. Staff who go back and forth between ill and well residents, play and important role in transmitting the virus from resident to resident. To the extent possible, keep staff from \"floating\" between floors/units. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Norovirus General & Outbreak Recommendations 2 Iowa Department of Public Health Food handlers who are ill with gastrointestinal symptoms MUST NOT prepare or serve food under any circumstances. It is strongly recommended that symptomatic food handling staff be sent home immediately . There has been uncertainty over the effectiveness of alcohol based hand gels against norovirus. IDPH always recommends washing hands. Alcohol based hand gels should only be used in situations where soap and warm water may not be available. Outbreak: Limit staff from moving between affected and unaffected units and limit any nonessential personnel from affected units. Facility Recommendations: General: Medical equipment used for care of norovirus infected patients, should be either dedicated to that room for the duration of isolation or be thoroughly disinfected upon removal from the room. Selection of appropriate cleaning agent should be consistent with the equipment manufacturer's recommendation for compatibility. Refer to IDPH Norovirus Environmental Cleaning Fact Sheet for appropriate cleaning methods. Outbreak: Consider limiting new admissions to the affected units until the incidence of new ill cases has reached zero. Inform visitors about a possible disease outbreak in your facility. Consider limiting or stopping visitation to th e facility until there have been no new cases for at least 48 hours. Post extra hand washing signs in various visible areas in the facility. It may be useful to collect stool specimens from residents/patients to confirm norovirus is the cause of the ou tbreak.

It is a group of viruses that usually cause severe cold -like symptoms, including fever and chills and less commonly, pneumonias. Who is at risk? Anyone; however, illness is more common and severe in infants , children and the elderly. How do you get parainfuenza? It is spread directly by contact with saliva and indirectly by contact with droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. It is also spread indirectly by hands, tissues, eating utensils and other articles freshly contaminated with respiratory secretions of an infected person. What are the symptoms? The symptoms may include fever, chills, headache, general muscle aches, tiredness, lack of appeti te, runny nose, sore throat, as well as lung infections, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. In infants, vomiting or diarrhea may also occur. How soon after infection do symptoms appear? They symptoms usually start 1 to 10 days after infection. Where is parainfluenza found? The viruses are only found in humans. In fections occur most commonly during fall, winter and occasionally spring. How long can a person spread parainfluenza? A person can spread the virus to others shortly before illness and during their illness. How is parainfluenza treated? There is no specific treatment. Most people get well on their own in 2 -5 days. The use of antibiotics is not appropriate in most cases because antibiotics are not effective against viruses. How can the spread of parainfluenza be prevented? Contact isolation should be us ed if children are hospitalized. Other ill persons should avoid contact with young children, the debilitated or chronically ill, the elderly, and persons with other illnesses. Frequent handwashing, covering the mouth when coughing and sneezing, proper di sposal of tissues, and cleaning of dishes and drinking utensils will also decrease the spread of this and other viruses. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Parainfluenza 1 FACT SHEET PINWORMS What are pinworms? Pinworms are small thread- like parasitic worms that live in the bowel or lower digestive tract of people. Usually at night they travel to the rectal opening and lay eggs on the outside skin. Who is at risk? This parasitic condition is extremely common, affecting people of all social and economic levels. Estimates indicate that 10% of the general American population is infected. People, especially preschool-age children, are the only host for these worms. D ogs, cats, and other household pets do not get pinworms although they may have other types of worms in their digestive tract. How do you get pinworms? Pinworm eggs are spread from direct transfer between hands and anus to the same person or others. Indirectly they can spread through clothing, bedding, food and other articles in the living environment. Dust may spread the eggs in heavily contaminated households and indoor environments. What are the symptoms of pinworms? They are usually harmless and produce no symptoms except severe anal itching. This itching can sometimes cause nervousness and irritability during the day and restlessness and difficulty in sleeping during the night. How are pinworms diagnosed? The best method of diagnosis is to apply ce llophane tape to the skin around the anus in the morning before bathing or having a bowel movement. The eggs stick to the tape and can be observed with microscopic examination. Sometimes the worms may be visible around stool matter after going to the toilet. How are pinworms treated? There are three drugs in pill form and liquid medication to treat this condition. Contact your health care provider for the right drug for you. Change bed linen and underwear of infected person daily for several days after treatment. Treatment should be repeated after 2 weeks. How can pinworms be prevented? All members of the household should wash hands frequently using soap and warm water and at least 15 seconds of scrubbing and cleaning under fingernails especially afte r going to the toilet and before eating. You should also frequently clean and vacuum floors of bedrooms and bathrooms. Launder bed linen, clothing, and pajamas; dry on hot cycle. Keep toilet seats clean. Check all members of a family for the presence of eggs. Doctors may choose to treat the entire family when one member is infected. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Pinworms 1 FACT SHEET POISON IVY What is poison ivy? Poison ivy is a \"contact dermatitis,\" or a skin rash with blisters. It is caused by an allergic reaction to the oily substance urushiol, or sap, in the leaves, stalks, roots, flowers, and berries of the poison -ivy plant. Who gets poison ivy? Anyone. Contact with poison ivy is one of the most frequent causes of skin rash in children during the spring, summer and fall. The oils of these plants can cause a reaction in over 50% of people. What are the symptoms of poison ivy? Symptoms usually appear within 1 -3 days of exposure, but may appear as long as 3 weeks later. Redness and extreme itching are the first. Severe itching, redness, and swelling are followed by blisters. The rash is often in the pattern of streaks or patches consistent with where the plant touched the skin. The worst stage of the rash is usually four to seven days after exposure. It may last for one to two weeks. Reactions may vary from very mild to very severe, in highly sensitive individuals, sometimes even requiring hospitalization. How is poison ivy spread? Any body part may be affected as long as it comes in direct contact with the oil of the plant or with smoke from burning poison ivy. Rubbing or scratching the skin, when the oil is st ill on it, can spread the oil from one part of the body to another. Contact with urushiol can occur in three ways: 1) Direct contact - touching the sap of the toxic plant, 2) Indirect contact - touching something on which urushiol is present. The oil can st ick to the fur of animals, to garden tools or sports equipment, or to any objects that have come into contact with it. 3) Airborne contact - burning poison plants puts urushiol particles into the air. It is not spread by the fluid of the blisters, therefore is not contagious person -to-person, unless the oil remains on the skin and is touched by another person. What is the treatment for poison ivy? Treatment does not cure poison ivy; it just eases the discomfort. Without treatment, a mild case will resolve in approximately 2 weeks. It is important to keep your hands away from eyes, mouth and face. Though it is difficult, try not to scratch. This may cause infection. Cool compresses, baking soda or oatmeal (Aveeno) soaks may offer some relief. Calamine lotion may help (topical Benadryl may make the rash worse). Antihistamines (Benadryl oral) may relieve the itching at night to help you sleep. If your doctor prescribes medications, be sure to follow the instructions. A medicine called corticosteroid may be prescribed for more serious cases of rash with swelling (over the counter corticosteroids are too weak to be effective). In cases of severe or extensive rash, especially around the face or genitals, your doctor may prescribe oral medicine. Call immediately for emergency medical assistance if: The patient begins to experience a severe allergic reaction such as: swelling of the airway (throat, tongue, mouth or nose) difficulty breathing or swallowing weakness dizziness bluish lips o r mouth unconsciousness history of having experienced a severe reaction to poison ivy from a past exposure cough following exposure to the smoke of burning poison ivy plants Notify your physician if any of the following happens: The itching is severe and cannot be controlled The rash affects the face, lips, eyes or genitals You develop a fever over 100o F. orally The rash or blisters show signs of infection, such as pus, yellow fluid leaking from blisters, odor or increased tend erness. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Poison Ivy 1 The prescribed treatments and medicines do not bring relief within a few days. Can a person get poison ivy again? Yes, anytime exposure to the plant oil occurs. What can be done to prevent the spread of poison ivy? Learn to identify these pla nts and teach your children to identify them as soon as they are able. Teach them to avoid contact with the plants or smoke caused by burning them. Over -the-counter creams, such as Ivy Block or Stoko Gard Outdoor Cream, applied at least 15 minutes before exposure, form a barrier against the plant's sap. If you plan to be in an area where poison ivy grows, wear long sleeves and long pants. Wear vinyl gloves (urushiol can soak through rubber). Rinse off tools after using them. Wash your clothing and shoes and use care not to transfer the urushiol to rugs or furniture. Wash any body surfaces that have had contact with the poison ivy as soon as possible (preferably within 5 -10 minutes after exposure). Be sure to clean under your fingernails because oil c an be spread from scratching. Do not touch the skin or clothing of the exposed person with your bare hands. Bathe animals that may have been exposed.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that can cause infection of the upper and lower respiratory tracts in people of all ages. The infection can be minor, producing col d-like symptoms or major illness such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small air passages in the lungs). RSV commonly occurs in Iowa from December to April. Who gets RSV? Babies (especially those born early), people with immune system problems, people with heart or lung problems, and older adults have a higher risk of getting severe disease with RSV infection. RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia among infants under one year of age. Severe lower lung disease is more likely among the elderly and those with heart or lung disease and weakened immune systems. What are the symptoms of RSV? RSV infections cause symptoms like those of the common cold: a stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, wheezing and coughing, a low fever, and earache. Babies may have additional symptoms that include lack of appetite, disrupted sleep, little interest in things going on around them, and being fussy. Rarely, some babies may also have apnea, a condition in which breathing stops for about 15 to 20 seconds. Are there medicines I can take if I get sick with RSV? For children with mild disease, no specific treatment is necessary other than symptom relief. Children with severe disease may require oxygen therapy and sometimes mechanical ventilation. Your doctor may give additional medications. How is RSV spread? Infection spreads from persons to person through close contact with infected persons or contaminated surfaces or objects. The virus is most often spread by getting droplets containing the virus on your hands and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. How long is an infected person able to spread RSV? Infected persons can usually spread the virus for 3 -8 days; however, in young infants, the period for spread may be as long as 3 -4 weeks. What should I do to protect myself and my family from RSV? Wash your hands often during the day. If you cannot wash your hands, alcohol -based hand cleaner may be used if your hands do not look dirty. Stay away from others you know are ill. You are less likely to become ill if you stay at least three feet from someone who is coughing or sneezing. Do not share items such as cups, glasses and eating utensils Throw tissues away right after they are used Clean and disinfect toys shared by multiple children Can I get RSV more than once? Yes, infection can occur repeatedly throughout life, sometimes even during the same season. Is there a vaccine for RSV? Currently no vaccine is available. Research is underway to develop a vaccine. Iowa Dept. of P ublic Health Reviewed 10/12 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) corporis Ringworm of the body is a fungal disease of body skin in general. Ringworm of the scalp is Tinea capitis. Tinea Tinea cruris is ringworm of the groin or private area (males are infected more often than females). Treatment often differs with the different types of fungi and the body region affected. Who gets r ingworm? Anyone can get ringworm. How is ringworm spread? The fungus that causes the disease occurs worldwide and is transmittable by direct contact with infected humans, animals, or contaminated objects where the fungi persist (e.g. shower stalls, floors or locker room surfaces such as benches or wrestling mats). Fungi will readily enter skin that has been broken by friction, abrasion (e.g. mat or 'rug burns' on wrestlers), or excessive perspiration (under arms or private areas), especially when environmental temperatures and humidity are high. What are the symptoms of ringworm? The fungal disease appears characteristically as a reddish round- shaped lesion with a red raised border. It may occur as a single sore or multiple sores may be present. The sor e(s) may look reddish, be fluid filled or may be dry and scaly or moist and crusted. As the circular lesion spreads from the center toward the outer edge, the center often clears and returns to a normal appearance. An itching sensation in or around the sore's border is common. How soon do symptoms appear? The first symptoms usually appear from 4 - 10 days after contact with the fungi. How long can an infected person spread ringworm? The skin fungus can be spread as long as the lesion(s) are present an d live fungus persists on contaminated materials or objects. Should infected persons be excluded from school or work with ringworm? While being treated, infected persons should be kept out of gymnasiums, swimming pools and other activities likely to lead to close contact exposure of others. Infected persons do not need to be excluded from work or classroom settings. What is the treatment for ringworm? Thorough bathing with soap and water, removal of scabs and crusts, and the application of an effective topical (e.g. creams, lotions or ointments) ciclopiroxzole may be all that is needed to treat the fungus. If topical treatment(s) do not work a doc tor may prescribe an anti- fungal pill. A prescription medication, Griseofulvin, given by mouth is effective; oral itraconazole is useful in grisceofulvin -resistant ringworm. How can the spread of ringworm be stopped? Children infected with ringworm should not participate in contact sports. While being treated, infected school children must be kept from gymnasiums, swimming pools and activities likely to lead to close contact with other children. Clothing and bedding must be laundered frequently. Investigate for the source of infection. Examine school contacts, household pets and farm animals and treat their infections as needed. Launder towels and clothing in hot water and a commercial fungicidal agent. Clean showers and dressin g rooms of gymnasiums with frequent hosing and rapid draining of shower rooms. Fungicidal agents should be used regularly to disinfect benches, wrestling mats, and floors. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Ringworm 1 FACT SHEET ROSEOLA What is Roseola? Roseola is a viral infection causing fever and rash in infants and children between the ages of 6 and 24 months. Most people get this illness early in life, sometimes without having symptoms of the illness. Roseola is also known as sixth disease, exanthem subitum, and roseola infantum. What are the symptoms of Roseola ? An ill child may have any one or all of the following symptoms : High fever (above 103o F lasting 3 to 5 days ) o Fever may cause seizure activity o The child may not feel very ill when fever is present Red raised skin rash lasting from hours to several days (may be seen on face, neck and trunk of body) o The rash usually is seen the day the fever breaks (around the 4th day) How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms usually begin 5 to 15 days after infection . How is this illness spread? Roseola is spread in the following ways: Person -to-person contact The virus sometimes lives in the nose and throat mucous or saliva of healthy people who have had the illness in the past The most common way the illness is spread to children is from adults who have no symptoms but are shedding the virus in their saliva. Who gets the illness? Roseola is seen most commonly in infants and children between the ages of 6 and 24 mont hs. Most children have had the illness by age 4 years. For how long is a person infectious? The period of time the illness can be spread from person to person is not known. What is the treatment? Keep child comfortable. Medication to relieve fever may be given. Do ill children need to be excluded from child care or school? No, however c hildren who appear ill, fussy and have a high fever may be excluded. What can be done to help prevent the spread of illness? Good personal hygiene including frequent hand washing should be practice d by all. Iowa Department of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Roseola 1 FACT SHEET ROTAVIRUS What is rotavirus and its symptoms? It is a virus that can cause diarrhea, which usually starts with, or is accompanied by, vomiting and/or a low -grade fever (more than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit). How do you get rotavi rus? Most human infections result from hand -to-mouth contact with an infected person's stools. The virus is present in the stools during the illness and can last for up to 8 days after the start of symptoms. Rotavirus can be found on toys and hard surfaces in the home and child care centers. This means the toys, furniture, or the floor may serve as a transmission source. Coughing or sneezing may also spread the virus. Rotavirus is easily spread among family members or children in child care. Rotavirus i s the most common intestinal infection in child - care settings. The time from exposure to illness in a child is usually 1 - 3 days. How is rotavirus infection diagnosed? Your doctor may collect a rectal swab or a stool sample from the child. What is the treatment for rotavirus? There is none. Fluids and sometimes intravenous (IV) fluids are given to prevent or treat dehydration. Who gets rotavirus? Anyone. Diarrhea is uncommon in infected infants less than 3 months old. It is most common in infants be tween of 6 and 24 months old. By age 3, most children have had rotavirus and are immune, or protected, from the virus. Persons who are immune- compromised, such as those receiving chemotherapy for cancer or who have HIV or AIDS, may have lost their immuni ty and could be at risk of getting sick from rotavirus. What can be done to stop the spread of rotavirus? The virus can live for a long time on hard surfaces, in unclean water, and on hands. It is best killed by bleach. Dressing infants with overalls to cover diapers has been shown to lessen spread of the virus. Hand washing is important after using the bathroom and changing diapers. Make sure child's hands are washed after using the bathroom or having diapers changed. Children with diarrhea should be k ept out of preschool or child care. Frequent handwashing with soap and warm water of the infants or children and all of their caregivers is most important in controlling and preventing the spread of rotavirus. Is there a vaccine for rotavirus? Yes. An o ral vaccine is available for use in children. The vaccine is for infants . Babies should receive three doses of the oral vaccine at two, four, and six months of age. If you have additional vaccine questions contact your health care provider. Iowa Dep t. of Public Health Local Public Health Agency (LPHA) : No follow -up required, unless outbreak occurs Iowa Department of Public Health Disease Reporting Hotline: (800) 362- 2736 Secure Fax: (515) 281 -5698 1) THE DISEASE AND ITS EPIDEMIOLOGY A. Agent Scabies is caused by a parasitic infestation of the skin caused by a mite, Sarcoptes scabiei . The microscopic mite in the adult female stage is approximately 1/16 th inch in length. Th e body of the mite is rounded in shape and has four pair of legs. The front two pair of legs end in suckers and the rear two pair of legs end in long trailing bristles. Adult females are largest with the greater part of the interior taken up by ovaries and developing eggs. The adult female burrows into the epidermal layers of the skin, copulates with an entering male and lays two to three eggs per day. The eggs hatch in 2 to 3 days as larval mites with three pair of legs. After one to two days, larval mite s return to the surface of the skin and reburrow elsewhere for protection and to feed. Three days later the larva molts to the nymph stage with four pair of legs and later again molts to adult male and female stages. Eggs to adult stages require 10 -14 days ; adult females may live for over 30 days on the host. Less than 10% of eggs give rise to adults. In fact, most otherwise healthy patients have fewer than 10 adult female mites. (Long -term care (LTC) patients often have considerably more mites than patients in good health.) As mites initially infect a host, there is minimal tissue reaction as they penetrate the superficial layer of the skin (stratem corneum). Mites feed on intracellular lymph -like fluid rather than blood as capillaries do not reach into th e epidermal layer. Subsequently discharges of the mites elicit a T -cell mediated immune reaction and, after a 2 - 6 week period, the characteristic pruritic papules develop. Pruritis itself becomes a defensive mechanism to reduce the presence of mites. For a person who has had scabies before, symptoms appear within several days. People do not become immune to an infestation. Patients who are immunosuppressed by varying degrees often have decreased pruritis. Frequently there is no itching in crusted scabies patients with severely impaired cell -mediated immunity. One special consideration is that healthcare staff who attend to patients with high mite burdens often are exposed to large numbers of larval and nymphal mites that burrow into the skin and cause a red papular rash. Exposure is most common on the upper arms and thighs. Most of these mites are washed off or scratched out but the longer the source patient is unrecognized, the greater the likelihood that immature forms will survive to adulthood, progres s to mated female mite(s), and establish an infestation on the host. B. Clinical Description Symptoms : Signs and symptoms of scabies infestation include: Pimple- like irritations, burrows or rash of the skin, especially the webbing between the fingers; the skin folds on the wrist, elbow, or knee; the penis, the breast, or shoulder blades. Intense itching, especially at night and over most of the body. Iowa Department of Public Health, Reviewed 10/12 Scabies 5 Sores on the body caused by scratching. These sores can sometimes become infected with bacteria Onset : Two to six weeks before onset of itching in people without previous exposure. People who have been previously infested develop symptoms 1 - 4 days after re -exposure. \"Norwegian \" scabies differ from regular scabies simply in the number of mites present. In regular scabies the number of mites on a host at any one time is, on average 10 - 15. Persons with Norwegian or crusted scabies, will have thousands to millions of mites. Consequently, their skin manifestations are much more severe with thick, hyper keratotic crusts that can occur on almost any area of the body. The type of mite is exactly the same in both presentations. The difference lies with the host, with those developing Norwegian scabies usually having a compromised immune system. Clinically, Norwegian scabies differs from regular scabies in two ways: 1. it presents with more severe skin manifestations, and 2. it is usually not very pruritic. C. Reservoirs Common reservoirs : Humans. Sar coptes species and other mites of animals can live on h umans but do not reproduce on them. D. Modes of Transmission Person -to-person: Transfer of parasites is by direct contact with infested skin and can be acquired during sexual contact. Transfer from undergarments and bedclothes occurs only if these have been contaminated by infested people immediately beforehand. Mites can burrow beneath the skin surface in 2.5 minutes. Persons with the Norwegian scabies syndrome are highly contagious because of the large number of mites that are present in the exfoliat ing scales. E. Incubation period Two to six weeks pass before onset of itching in people without previous exposure. People who have been previously infested develop symptoms 1 - 4 days after re -exposure. Once away from the human body, mites do not surviv e more than 48 -72 hours. When living on a person, an adult female mite can live up to a month. F. Period of Communicability or Infectious Period Until mites and eggs are destroyed by treatment, ordinarily after 1 or occasionally 2 courses of treatment. G. Epidemiology Scabies occurs in multi- year cyclic waves with peak incidence about every 30 years. The last peak in the U.S. was in the mid -1970's but large numbers of cases continue to be reported in institutional settings. Typical patient groups include young children who readily transmit the mite during play, young adults where it represents an STD, and institutional populations where underlying health conditions predispose to exposures, transmission, and, once infected, heavier than usual mite numbers. Sub sequent transmission to healthcare staff is frequent when caring for scabetic patients in institutions. Institutional subgroups at risk of scabies include Down's syndrome, transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy, elderly residents of long- term ca re (LTC) facilities, AIDS patients, and cancer chemotherapy patients. Some of these patients will have very heavy mite burdens (\"atypical crusted scabies\") and present a higher risk of transmission to staff and other residents. Less frequently some of thes e patients will develop crusted or keratotic scabies (a.k.a. Norwegian scabies) with extremely thick scaly, crusty skin lesions that appear grayish in color and often are associated with thousands to millions of mites. . These patients may not experience a ny pruritis as a function of depressed immunity thus permitting development of large mite populations. Exfoliated skin scales on Iowa Department of Public Health, Reviewed 10/12 Scabies 5 and around furniture, bedding, clothing and other fomites may have many live mites and pose a risk of exposure to others. A variant form of \"scabies\" is pseudo - or psycho -scabies in which the patient suffers varying degrees of delusions that they are infected. Power -of-suggestion plus ordinary background itching often generates this condition. Skin scrapings are always negative. Susceptibility increases during cold months when dry skin results in increased background itching. Severe cases should be referred to a dermatologist for evaluation. H. Bioterrorism Potential None. 2) DISEASE REPORTING AND CASE INVESTIGATION A. Purpose of C ase investigation. There is no requirement for disease reporting unless an outbreak is occurring. To identify whether the case may be a source of infection for other persons and, if so, to prevent further transmission. To identify transmission sources of public health concern and to stop transmission from such sources. 3) CONTROLLING FURTHER SPREAD A. Isolation and Quarantine Requirements None. B. Protection of Contacts of a Case Avoid direct physical contact with people who have scabies and their belongin gs, especially clothing and bedding. Early proper treatment of infested persons is extremely important to stop the spread of scabies. C. Managing Special Situations Reported Incidence Is Higher than Usual/Outbreak Suspected Scabies infestations remain a problem in institutional settings particularly in long- term care (LTC) facilities. Introductions are almost never recognized and hands- on care promotes transmission to staff and other residents. D. Preventive Measures Recognition and management of a sca bies outbreak are challenging issues for long- term care facilities and institutions. One must recognize that all institutional populations have background skin problems, which tend to confuse staff and attending physicians. The typical lesions that suggest possible scabies are red, raised, and pruritic papules and less commonly burrows. Burrows are diagnostic for scabies but are seldom seen in patients with good hygiene. The gold standard for scabies diagnosis is skin scrapings with microscopic examination for mites, eggs or scybala (fecal pellets). Recovering mites and eggs in scrapings requires some practice, skill, and patience, particularly from otherwise healthy patients who may have fewer than five adult female mites. However institutional populations often have heavy mite burdens and offer opportunity to recover mites without extraordinary effort. Techniques for scraping are many and varied. The simplest technique is to obtain either a # 10 or #20 sterile disposable scalpel blade attached to a plastic handle and place drops of oil on the blade or skin lesion and scrape until the oil becomes cloudy with skin debris. Standard references call for use of mineral oil that is not highly viscous. It is r ecommended to use type B microscopic immersion Iowa Department of Public Health, Reviewed 10/12 Scabies 5 oil since it readily adheres to the blade. The oil with superficial skin fragments is then tapped off or transferred to a slide. Oil that remains on the blade can be scraped off with the cover slip that is then dropped on the slide over the earlier transferred oil to produce a \"wet mount\". Beginning in one corner of the cover slip, the preparation is screened under 4X (low power) in a metho dical back -and-forth manner (e.g. like mowing a yard). The 10X objective may be used to occasionally study detail of suspect structures. Illustrations of sarcoptes mites, demodex mites, eggs and scybala are included in appendices. Other techniques include identifying burrows with a felt tip ink pen or tetracycline technique. In the former a black or blue felt tip pen is rubbed ov er the suspect lesion and the ink removed with an alcohol wipe. If a burrow is present, capillary action will have drawn the ink into the burrow, which will not be removed by the alcohol wipes and will be visible through the superficial epidermis. The tetracycline technique is similar in that a small amount of soluble liquid tetracycline is applied over the suspect lesion and then removed. The lesion is then viewed under a Wood's lamp for presence of tetracycline that fluoresces in the burrow. If burrows ar e seen, the mite (usually an adult female) can be removed by scraping or by epidermal shave biopsy with a scalpel. Lesions can also be examined by conventional skin biopsy however that procedure requires a clinic, physician staffing, and a technician to p repare tissue for examination. Simple skin scrapings have a lot to offer. The technique is easy to perform; usually meets with patient approval; and provides the option of immediate diagnosis on -site without delay. Equipment needed includes a light micros cope with 4X and 10X objective and ideally a mechanical stage. Ideally the person doing the scrapings should read the slides. Over time, competence improves with practice. LTC facilities are encouraged to perform their own skin scrapings. Treatment Infested persons and their close physical contacts should be treated at the same time, regardless of whether symptoms are present. Crusted scabies is very easily transmissible, and treatment of persons who have been minimally exposed is warranted. There are several topical treatments available for scabies. The person should bathe before application of a scabicide to include trimming the fingernails and removing or washing out debris from under the nails. After drying the skin, the scabicide is applied to the en tire body from the ears and chin downward. After the period of therapy is complete, the scabicide may be removed with another bath and the bedding changed before retiring. Briefly, all topical products available in the U.S. for treatment are available only by prescription and include: 1. 5% permethrin cream. It has low toxicity and is a very effective scabicide. A second administration one week after the first is often routinely prescribed. 5% permethrin cream is the topical treatment of choice for LTC res idents. 2. Crotamiton (Eurax), 10% cream or lotion. This product applied for 24 hours than rinsed off, and then reapplied for an additional 24 hours constitutes one treatment. Many scabies experts consider this product the least effective scabicide. Its advantages are it is very non - toxic and has non -specific antipruritic qualities. 3. Lindane, 1% cream or lotion. This product is potentially neurotoxic. It should not be used on patients with neurologic conditions, infants or pregnant or breast -feeding w omen. It is also sometimes very irritating to skin of elderly patients. In addition, there is increasing evidence that sarcoptes mites have developed tolerance or resistance to this product. We recommend limited use of lindane to treat scabies. One 8 -hour application constitutes one treatment. 4. Ivermection is an oral antiparasitic agent approved for the treatment of worm infestations. Evidence suggests that oral ivermectin may be a safe and effective treatment for scabies; Iowa Department of Public Health, Reviewed 10/12 Scabies 5 however, ivermectin is not FDA -approved for this use. Oral ivermectin has been reported effective in the treatment of crusted (Norwegian) scabies; its use should be considered for patients who have failed treatment with or who cannot tolerate FDA -approved topical medications for the tre atment of scabies. A total of two or more doses of ivermectin may be necessary to eliminate a scabies infestation. One treatment is one oral dose of 200 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. This is repeated two weeks after the first dose. 5. Sulphur is used as an ointment (2 %-10%) and usually 6% ointment is preferred. After a preliminary bath, the sulphur ointment is applied and thoroughly rubbed into the skin over the whole body for two or three consecutive nights. Patients should apply the ointment personally, if possible, as it ensures that their hands will be well impregnated. Ointments are more useful than any other preparation. Topical sulphur ointment is messy, malodorous, and stains clothing. Sulphur should be used only in situations where adult s cannot tolerate lindane, permethrin, or ivermectin as it is inferior to all these agents. Sulphur is recommended as a safe alternative for the treatment of scabies in infants, children, and pregnant women. Home: Infested persons and their close physical contacts should be treated at the same time, regardless of whether symptoms are present. Persons who have contact of this nature, but not those with more casual contact, should be treated. Institutions: Scabies epidemics frequently occur in nursing home s, hospitals, residential facilities, and other communities. Control of an epidemic can only be achieved by treatment of the entire population at risk. Ivermectin can be considered in this setting, especially if treatment with topical scabicides fails. The value of mass treatment versus select treatment of affected wards or wings is problematic. Select treatment may be employed if repeat skin scrapings are available to monitor skin problems. In any case overall treatment strategies need to be openly and th oroughly discussed by administrators, nursing staff, and medical staff. Environmental Measures The environment is exaggerated in regards to scabies. One expert states that only 1 in 200 cases of scabies are acquired from fomites and the environment. Laundering bedding and clothing worn or used by patients anytime during the 3 days before treatment, using hot cycles of both the washer and dryer, or disinfest ing by storing in a closed plastic bag for a minimum of four days, or dry - cleaning will kill mites a nd eggs, but may not be needed for most infestations . Laundering bedding and clothing is most important for patients with crusted (Norwegian) scabies because potential for fomite transmission is high. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Rooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use. Environmental disinfestation using pesticide sprays or fogs is unnecessary and should be discouraged. Preventive Measures/ Education Avoid direct physical contact with people who have scabies and their belongings, especially clothing and bedding. Early proper treatment of infested persons is extremely important to stop the spread of scabies.

Scabies is a skin disease caused by an almost invisible bug called a mite. Scabies mites burrow under the skin, producing pimple -like bumps. What are the symptoms of scabies? The major symptom of scabies is intense itching, particularly at night. In adults, the areas of the skin most affected by scabies include the webs and sides of the fingers, wrists, elbows, armpits, waist, genitals, breasts and lower buttocks. In children, the feet and toes are also commonly affe cted. How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms will appear in 2 - 6 weeks in people who have never had scabies. People who have had scabies before may show symptoms within 1 - 4 days. How is scabies spread? Scabies mites spread by direct skin -to-skin contact. Transfer of scabies from undergarments or bedclothes can happen only if these are reused immediately after being used by an infected person. Scabies can also be spread during sexual contact. Who gets scabies? Anyone can get scabies. Scabies most commonly occurs in nursing homes, institutions and child care centers. How long is a person infectious? A person can spread scabies until mites and eggs are destroyed by effective treatment. What is the treatment for this illness? Skin products are available from a doctor for the treatment of scabies. The products are generally applied to the whole body except the face and neck. Always follow label instructions. A few persons may require a second treatment 7 - 10 days later. Itching may continue during and for several days after treatment. Skin care is important to reduce itching due to skin dryness, which may be caused by the treatment. Clothes and bedding should be washed using the hot cycle of both the washer and dryer. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or child care? People may return to school, work, or a child care center after receiving an initial treatment. What can be done to help prevent the spread of scabies? Avoid direct physical contact with people who have scabi es and their belongings, especially clothing and bedding. Early proper treatment of infested persons is extremely important to stop the spread of scabies.

Germs called Staphylococcus aureus are bacteria. They are often j ust called \"staph.\" Many healthy people carry staph in their noses or on their skin. Sometimes staph bacteria can cause infections. Usually these infections are skin infections like pimples and boils. Sometimes they are more serious infections like lung o r blood infections. What is Methicillin -Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)? MRSA is a type of staph that has changed (become resistant) due to overuse and abuse of antibiotics. Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria. This resistant staph can't be k illed by the usual antibiotics, like penicillin. Certain other antibiotics will still kill MRSA. What is Community -Associated MRSA (CA -MRSA)? In the past, most infections caused by MRSA were in hospitals or nursing homes. Now, people who have not recently been in a hospital or nursing home are getting infections caused by MRSA. These are called community- associated MRSA infections. CA -MRSA infections are usually skin infections, like pimples or boils. These infections may need to be treated with careful ly chosen antibiotics. It is also possible for CA -MRSA to cause blood, bone, and lung infections. Who is at risk for MRSA infections? Anyone can get an infection with MRSA. However MRSA infections are most common in hospitals and nursing homes. How is MRSA spread? The bacteria enter the body through open cuts and scrapes on the skin. The bacteria usually spread when a person with MRSA on their skin comes into contact with another person's skin. Hand washing and keeping wounds covered is important in stopping a possible spread of the infection. A less common way to spread MRSA is to share towels and sports equipment. What does a MRSA infection look like? MRSA may cause a skin infection that looks like a pimple or boil. The sore often looks like a spider bite. It can be red, swollen, painful, and may drain pus. If you think a child in your care may have a skin infection, suggest to the parents that the child be seen by their healthcare provider. How can the spread of MRSA be prevented? To prevent the s pread of MRSA in child care facilities, follow the same good hygienic practices used to prevent all disease. These practices include: Handwashing is the simplest, most effective way to prevent infection. o Keep fingernails short and do not wear artificial nails. o Instruct children and staff to wash their hands for at least 15 seconds with warm, running water and soap. Singing the \"ABCs\" song while washing hands takes about 15 seconds. Alcohol -based gels may be used when hands are not visibly soiled or handwashing facilities are not available. o Always use disposable towels. Do not use a common hand towel. o Children and staff should wash their hands before eating, after using the restroom or being diapered, after playing on the playground, after sneezing or touc hing one's nose, after handling pets / animals, and before going home. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 MRSA Child Care Fact Sheet 1 Staff should wear gloves when dealing with urine, stool and blood and when administering first aid. Wash hands after removing gloves. Staff should use disposable cleaning cloths. If r eusable cloths are used, they must be washed on a regular basis with chlorine bleach. Do not use sponges. Clean equipment and other environmental surfaces with which multiple individuals have bare skin contact with an over the counter detergent / disinfectant that specifies Staphylococcus aureus on the label and is suitable for the type of surface being cleaned, or diluted bleach solution. Clothing and towels that are heavily soiled with body fluids should be washed by themselves in detergent and bleach us ing the hottest cycle possible for that fabric. Cover diaper changing tables with paper and discard paper after each diaper change. Clean any visible soil from the diapering area with detergent after each use. Then wet the entire changing surface with a s anitizing solution. Wash hands after diapering, even if gloves were used. For children or staff with any skin infection: Keep wounds covered with clean, dry bandages. Place all disposable wastes like dressings and bandages into plastic bags. Tie bags sec urely and discard with regular trash. Always clean hands immediately after touching infected skin or any item that has come into direct contact with a draining wound. Do not allow children to share items that may become contaminated with wound drainage, s uch as towels, clothing, bedding, and sports equipment that touches the skin. Children and staff with draining wounds that cannot be contained with dressings should be excluded from child care until the wound heals.

Some infections may need antibiotics. Tell your healthcare provider if you are not getting better in a few days. You may need to go to the hospital to receive antibiotics directly into your veins. Be sure to tell any healthcare provider you see if you have had an MRSA infection in the past. If anyone you know gets a similar skin infection, have them see their healthcare provider. Please see the \" Antibiotic Resistance Fact Sheet\" for more information. 2 Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 MRSA Fact sheet FACT SHEET Methicillin- Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) For Health Professionals What is MRSA? MRSA stands for -resistant Staphylococc us aureus (S. aureus) . Methicillin -resistant S. aureus is also resistant to other penicillins and to cephalosporins. How does Community Associated MRSA differ from Healthcare Associated MRSA? Previously, infections with MRSA occurred primarily in hospita ls and nursing homes. Several years ago, outbreaks of MRSA began occurring in groups of people who had not recently been in the medical system. Subsequently, it was found that MRSA isolates in the community (CA -MRSA) had bacteriologic characteristics that differed from healthcare associated (HA -MRSA) isolates. CA -MRSA isolates often possess genes for the Panton -Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin, which are rare in HA -MRSA. The significance of the toxin is still being investigated, but it has been associated w ith primary skin infections and necrotizing pneumonia. Additionally CA -MRSA responds to a wider spectrum of antibiotics than HA -MRSA. Who is at risk for MRSA infections? CA-MRSA: Conditions that make the spread of CA -MRSA more likely include close skin -to-skin contact, cuts or scrapes, and crowded living conditions. Outbreaks have been reported in athletes, military recruits, children, prisoners, and men who have sex with men. HA-MRSA: Infections with HA -MRSA usually are associated with time spent in hospitals, nursing homes, or dialysis centers. Other risk factors include immune compromise and the presence of invasive lines. How is MRSA transmitted? The bacteria are spread from person -to-person by direct contact. Skin -to-skin contact with an infected person is the most significant risk factor for transmission. However, carriers can also transmit the infection. Survival of the bacteria on linens and surfaces is possible, but the environment is not thought to be a significant route of transmission. How d oes MRSA affect people? Approximately 0.8% of the US population has nasal colonization with MRSA. When MRSA causes infections, it most commonly causes skin infections such as furuncles and abscesses. These infections can initially be misdiagnosed as spider bites. More serious infections, such as sepsis, osteomyelitis, and necrotizing pneumonia are also possible. MRSA should be considered whenever a patient presents with skin or soft tissue infection. MRSA should also be in the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with sepsis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or pneumonia. How is MRSA diagnosed? Clinicians should collect specimens for culture and sensitivity from all patients with abscesses or purulent skin lesions, especially if they have severe local infection or systemic symptoms. If invasive infection with MRSA is suspected, a specimen from the appropriate sterile site should be collected. It is not necessary to collect nasal cultures from patients with suspected MRSA infection. How is MR SA treated? Colonization: There is continuing debate regarding decolonization of carriers. Currently, decolonization with mupirocin is suggested only if colonized individuals are thought to be the source of recurrent infections or if there is ongoing MRSA transmission in a well -defined cohort, such as a family. HA-MRSA: In most case requiring hospitalization intravenous antibiotics are the standard treatment . There are specific antibiotics recommended for treatment of HA -MRSA. 1 Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 MRSA Factsheet for Health Professionals CA-MRSA: Some superficial s kin infections may be treated with incision and drainage. If antibiotics are warranted, CA -MRSA is often susceptible to more antibiotics than HA -MRSA. How can the spread of MRSA be prevented? Practicing good hand hygiene is essential to control the sprea d of MRSA. Other measures to prevent becoming infected or transmitting infection to others are avoiding cross -contamination between clean and dirty linen, daily environmental cleaning, and proper handling of infectious waste. What are special considerations for MRSA infections in people treated as outpatients? Standard Precautions should be used for all patients. Contact Precautions should be used empirically for patients whose wound drainage cannot be contained. Precautions needed for other situations will vary on a case-by-case basis. Ideally, patients treated as outpatients should return within 48 hours for a follow -up visit. Patients and close contacts should be given these instructions: Keep wounds that are draining covered with clean, dry, bandage s. Clean hands regularly with soap and water or alcohol -based hand gel (if hands are not visibly soiled). Always clean hands immediately after touching infected skin or any item that has come in direct contact with a draining wound. Maintain good general hygiene with regular bathing. Do not share items that may become contaminated with wound drainage, such as towels, clothing, bedding, bar soap, razors, and sports equipment that touches the skin. Wash clothing that has come in contact with wound drainage af ter each use and dry thoroughly. If you are not able to keep your wound covered with a clean, dry bandage at all times, do not join in activities where you have skin to skin contact with other persons (such as in child care centers or sports) until your wound is healed. Clean equipment and other environmental surfaces with which multiple individuals have bare skin contact with an over the counter detergent/disinfectant that specifies Staphylococcus aureus on the product label and is suitable for the type of surface being cleaned. What are special considerations for MRSA colonization or infection in hospitalized patients ? The CDC recommends the use of Contact P recautions for all patients in acute care inpatient settings who are known or suspected to be infected or colonized with MRSA. What are special considerations for MRSA colonization or infection in nursing home residents? A person who is a carrier of MRSA should not be denied admission to a nursing home. When a person who is a carrier or has an acti ve infection is transferred to another facility, the receiving facility should be told of the MRSA status in advance of the move. See the Report of the Iowa Antibiotic Resistance Task Force for patient placement guidance. Are there MRSA guidelines availa ble in Iowa? The Report of the Iowa Antibiotic Resistance Task Force: A Public Health Guide published addresses antibiotic resistance in the state and puts forth guidelines for various levels of care. These guidelines can be obtained at: www.idph.state.ia.us/adper/antibiotic_resistance_iartf.asp 2 Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 MRSA Factsheet for Health Professionals Iowa Department of Public Health FACT SHEET GROUP B STREPTOCOCCI For Health Professionals (Group B Strep, GBS) What is Group B Strep (GBS)? Beta hemolytic streptococci group B (Group B Streptococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae , or GBS) has been the leading bacterial cause of illness and death among newborns in the United States since the 1970's. Disease in infants usually occurs as bacteremia, pneumonia, or meningitis. Infants with GB S disease may require prolonged hospitalization and expensive supportive therapy, and survivors may suffer permanent disability (e.g., loss of hearing or vision, or psychomotor retardation). The case -fatality rate for GBS is estimated to be 4% for newborn s. About one -third of healthy adults carry GBS as normal bowel flora. GBS disease is relatively uncommon, except in newborns. What are the symptoms of (GBS)? In newborns, symptoms are often non -specific and may include fever, difficulty feeding, irritability, or lethargy. Colonized adults, including pregnant women, are typically asymptomatic. GBS can cause disease in adults, manifested in pregnancy most often as urinary tract and intrauterine infections. How soon do symptoms appear? About half of cases of GBS among newborns happen in the first week of life (\"early -onset disease\"), and most of these cases start a few hours after birth. GBS may develop one week to several months after birth (\"late -onset disease\"). How is GBS spread? GBS typically spreads from the gastrointestinal tract; the genitourinary tract is frequently also colonized. Transmission from a colonized woman to her baby may occur before, or more commonly, during, birth. The incidence of GBS disease is higher among infants born to mother s who are <20 years of age or African American. Women with GBS bacterium during pregnancy are usually heavily colonized with GBS, and appear to be at increased risk for perinatal transmission. Colonized women who experience prolonged rupture of membranes, premature delivery, or intrapartum fever have a higher risk for transmitting GBS infection to their infants during labor and delivery. How can GBS be prevented? Intravenous penicillin G should be administered until delivery. Intravenous ampicillin is an acceptable alternative to penicillin G, but penicillin G is preferred because it has a narrow spectrum and is less likely to select for antibiotic resistant organisms. Clindamycin or erythromycin may be used for women allergic to penicillin, although the efficacy of these drugs for GBS prevention has not been measured in controlled trials. Oral antimicrobial agents should not be used to treat women who are identified with GBS during prenatal screening. Such treatment does not effectively eliminate carriage or prevent neonatal disease. Iowa Dept. of Pu blic Health Reviewed 10/12 Streptococcus Group B Health Professionals Fact Sheet 1 Iowa Department of Public Health What can be done to help prevent the spread of GBS? Administration of intravenous antibiotics during birth effectively reduces the incidence of neonatal GBS disease in infants of colonized women. To prevent neonatal GBS disease, the American College of Obstetricians, American Academy of Pediatrics, CDC and other professional organizations recommend using one of two of the following guidelines: Screen all pregnant women by collecting rectal and vaginal specimens between 35 and 37 weeks gestation; offer women with GBS on culture IV antibiotics. Provide intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to women with one or more risk factors (listed above) during labor or at membrane rupture, even at <37 weeks gestation (unless negative r esults of the GBS culture are already available) Iowa Dept. of Pu blic Health Reviewed 10/12 Streptococcus Group B Health Professionals Fact Sheet 2 FACT SHEET GROUP B STREPTOCOCCI (Group B strep, GBS) What is Group B Strep (GBS)? GBS is a bacterium that can kill babies with blood infection, pneumonia, or other infections. Babies that survive GBS may have long -term problems with hearing, vision, or learning. Not all babies who get GBS will have these problems. Group B Strep should not be confused with Group A Strep (the bacterium that causes strep throat). What are the symptoms of GBS? GBS in a newborn may cause fever, difficulty feeding, irritab ility, or lethargy. Most pregnant women who carry GBS have no symptoms. GBS can sometimes cause bladder infections during pregnancy or infections in the womb during labor or after delivery. How soon do symptoms appear? About half of cases of newborn GBS happen in the first week of life (\"early -onset disease\"), and most of these cases start a few hours after birth. GBS may also develop in infants one week to several months after birth (\"late -onset disease\"). How is GBS spread? Group B Strep is normally found in the birth canal and lower gut in some women. Women who have GBS can easily pass it from the gut to the rectum and then into the birth canal, resulting in transfer to the baby in the womb. The majority of GBS infections are passed during childbir th, when the baby comes into direct contact with the bacteria in the mother's birth canal. What is the treatment for this illness? If a pregnant woman tests positive for GBS at the time of delivery, the mother is given the antibiotics through a vein durin g labor and delivery. What can be done to help prevent the spread of GBS? Doctors should test all pregnant women for GBS. Women who test positive for GBS or have risk factors can be treated with an antibiotic. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Streptococcus Group B Fact Sheet 1 FACT SHEET GROUP A STREPTOCOCCUS What is group A Streptococcus ? Group A Streptococcus (GAS) or \"strep\" is a bacteria often found in the throat and on the skin Strep can be in your body and not cause any illness. It may also cause illnesses that range from mild to severe and even life threatening. Most strep infections are mild illnesses, such as \"strep throat\" or impetigo. Sometimes strep can reach parts of the body where bacteria are not usually found, such as the blood, deep muscle and fat tissue, or the lungs, and can cause serious infections. How is strep spread? Strep bacteria are spread by direct contact with drainage from the nose or throat of infected persons or by contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. Why do serious strep infections occur? Serious strep infections happen when the bacteria get past the bodies defenses. This may occur when a person has sores or other breaks in the skin that let the bacteria to get into the tissue. Who is most at risk of getting serious strep i nfections? Few people who come in contact with strep will get serious illness. Some will have a throat or skin infection. Most will have no symptoms at all. Although healthy people can get serious strep illness, those with cancer, diabetes, and kidney disease needing dialysis, and those who take certain medicine are at higher risk. Breaks in the skin, like cuts, wounds, or chickenpox lesions may provide a way for the bacteria to get into the body. How are strep infections treated? Strep infections can be treated with many different antibiotics. It is always important to complete the full course of antibiotics as ordered by your healthcare provider. What can be done to help stop serious strep infections? The spread of strep is less likely when you wash hands, after coughing and sneezing, before fixing foods and before eating. Persons with a sore throat should be seen by a healthcare provider. A lab test can say if it is strep throat. If it is, the person should stay home from work, school, or child care until 24 hours after starting antibiotics. All sores should be kept clean. If a sore gets red or puffy, drains pus or hurts, see a healthcare provider. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Group A Streptococcus Fact Sheet 1 Iowa Department of Public Health FACT SHEET GROUP A STREPTOCOCCUS For Health Professionals What is group A Streptococcus? Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a bacteria commonly found in the throat and on the skin. Group A streptococci can be present in the throat or on the skin and without causing symptoms, but they may cause illnesses that range from mild to life threatening. The majority of GAS infections are relatively mild, such as \"strep throat\" or impetigo. Occasionally, however, these bacteria can reach parts of th e body where bacteria are not usually found, such as the blood, deep muscle and fat tissue, or the lungs, and cause invasive infections. Two of the most severe but least common forms of invasive GAS disease are necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Necrotizing fasciitis, sometimes described by the media as \"the flesh -eating bacteria,\" is a destructive infection of muscle and fat tissue. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a rapidly advancing infection that causes shock and injury t o internal organs such as the kidneys, liver, and lungs. How are group A streptococci spread? Group A streptococci are spread by direct contact with drainage from the nose or throat of infected persons or by contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. The risk of spreading the infection is highest when a person is ill, such as with \"strep throat\" or an infected wound. Persons who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are much less contagious. Treatment of infected persons with an antibiotic that works for 24 hours or longer generally stops their ability to spread the bacteria. Household items like plates, cups, or toys most likely do not play a big role in disease transmission. Why does invasive group A streptococcal disease occur? Invasive gr oup A streptococcal infections occur when the bacteria get past the defenses of the person who is infected. This may occur when a person has sores or other breaks in the skin that allow the bacteria to get into the tissue. Health conditions that lessen a person's ability to fight infection also make invasive disease more likely. How common is invasive group A streptococcal disease? Approximately 9,000 to 11,000 cases of invasive GAS disease occur in the United States each year. Of these, about 6 -7% were streptococcal to xic shock syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis. In contrast, several million persons get \"strep throat\" and impetigo annually. Approximately 1,000 - 1,800 deaths occur annually due invasive GAS disease; 20% of those patient s with necrotizin g fasciitis, and more than half of the patients with streptococcal t oxic shock syndrome. Who is most at risk of getting invasive group A streptococcal disease? Few people who come in contact with GAS will develop invasive GAS disease; many will have a ro utine throat or skin infection, and most will have no symptoms at all. Although healthy people can get invasive GAS disease, those with chronic illnesses like cancer, diabetes, and kidney disease requiring dialysis, and those who use medications such as steroids are at higher risk. Breaks in the skin, like cuts, wounds, or chickenpox lesions may provide an opportunity for the bacteria to enter the body. What are the early signs and symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome? Early signs and symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis include fever, severe pain and swelling, and redness at the wound site. Early signs and symptoms of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome may include fever, dizziness, confusion, and a flat red rash over large areas of the body. Unfortunately, no sign or symptom is unique only to streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, making it sometimes difficult to differentiate from other illnesses. Iowa Dep t. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Group A Streptoc occus Health Professionals Fact Sheet 1 Iowa Department of Public Health How is group A streptococcal disease treated? GAS infections can be trea ted with many different antibiotics. Early treatment may reduce the risk of death in cases of invasive disease, although even the correct therapy does not prevent death in every case. It is always important to complete the full course of antibiotics. Wha t can be done to help prevent invasive group A streptococcal infections? The spread of all types of GAS infections may be reduced by good hand -washing, especially after coughing and sneezing, before preparing foods and before eating. Persons with sore thr oats should be seen by a doctor, who can perform tests to find out whether the cause is strep; if so, the person should stay home from work, school, or child care until 24 hours or more after starting antibiotic treatment. All wounds should be kept clean, and watched for possible signs of infection: increasing redness, swelling, drainage, and pain at the wound site. A person with signs of an infected wound (swelling, warmth or redness at the site), especially if fever develops, should seek medical care.

Agent Toxoplasmosis is caused by Toxoplasma gondii , an intracellular protozoan parasite of cats . B. Clinical Description Symptoms : Most people infected with Toxoplasma gondii will have no symptoms, but some will have flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, or muscle aches that last a few days to several weeks. Symptoms can resemble mononucleosis, including fever, sore throat and muscle aches. Cysts containing the parasite persist in the muscles following active disease, and can reactivate if the person becomes immunosuppressed. In immunocompromised people, especially those with HIV/AIDS infection, new or reactivated infection with Toxoplasma gondii may cause a variety of severe sympto ms, including cardiac and neurologic problems. Treatment is not routinely indicated in healthy, immunocompetent persons. Congenital Toxoplasmosis: Infection early in pregnancy may cause fetal death or a variety of serious clinical problems at birth. These problems include eye infection (chorioretinitis), neurologic symptoms and other generalized disease. Infection later in pregnancy may result in less apparent problems, including eye problems which may only be recognized years after birth. C. Reservoirs Cats (and members of the feline family) are the definitive hosts. They acquire the parasite from eating infected rodents or other meat. Other animals (notably rodents, sheep, goats, pigs, cows and birds) may be intermediate hosts and carry the infective cysts for a long period of time. D. Modes of Transmission Transmission is usually by eating under -cooked meat from infected animals or by ac cidentally eating oocysts (mature eggs) from dirt, sandboxes, or other places where cat feces may be found. Outbreaks ha ve been associated with unpasteurized milk or under- cooked meat. Congenital transmission results from primary maternal infection during pregnancy. E. Incubation period The incubation period is usually from 5 - 20 days when associated with cats; one outbreak from eating under -cooked meat was associated with an incubation period of 10 - 23 days. F. Period of Communicability or Infectious Period Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Toxoplasmosis 1 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Except for in utero transmission, T. gondii is not transmitted directly from person -to-person. Oocysts shed by cats be come infective from 1 - 5 days later and can remain infective in moist soil or water for over a year. Additionally, oocysts can remain infective in the meat of an infected animal until it is thoroughly cooked. G. Epidemiology T. gondii is found throughout th e world. In the United States it is estimated that 22.5% of the population 12 years and older have been infected with Toxoplasma . In various places throughout the world, it has been shown that up to 95% of some populations have been infected with Toxoplasm a. Infection is often highest in areas of the world that have hot, humid climates and lower altitudes. H. Bioterrorism Potential None. 2) DISEASE REPORTING AND CASE INVESTIGATION A.

D. Preventiv e Measures To prevent exposures, recommend the following: Pregnant women and AIDS patients should: Always thoroughly cook meat before eating. Freezing reduces the infectivity level but does not eliminate it. Do not clean cat litter boxes or pans. Always wear gloves during gardening or other contact with soil, wash hands immediately after contact, and always wash hands thoroughly before eating. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Toxoplasmosis 2 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting All others should: Feed cat's dry or canned food, and prevent them from hunting. Clean cat litter boxes or cat feces daily. Handle and dispose of cat feces carefully. Always wash hands before eating, and after handling cat or other animal feces, handling uncooked meat, or touching soil that might have cat feces in it. Cover children's sandboxes/sand piles to keep animals from defecating in play areas. Consider being tested for Toxoplasma if planning pregnancy (pre -existing infection in mothers is rarely, if ever, associated with congenital toxoplasmosis). 4) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION References American Academy of P ediatrics. 2003 Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, 26th Edition .

Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Toxoplasmosis 3 FACT SHEET TOXOPLASMOSIS What is toxoplasmosis? Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a one -celled parasite. Infection happens most often by eating or drinking food or water contaminated by the feces (stool) of infected cats. It may also result from eating infected meat that is served raw or undercooked. The parasites can spread from an infected pregnant woman to her baby. Who can be infected? Anyone. The disease usually does not cause symptoms, but is of concern for pregnant women, since it may aff ect pregnancies. Are there any problems that can result from toxoplasmosis infection? Infection of pregnant women can result in death or brain damage to the baby. Immunosuppressed persons may develop serious health problems after infection. What are the symptoms of toxoplasmosis? Infection can cause fever, headache, swelling of the lymph glands. Immunosuppressed people (such as people with AIDS or cancer) may have more serious illness. However, many people have no symptoms at all. How soon after infection do symptoms appear? Fever and headache appear within 5 - 23 days after handling infected cat feces or after eating infected meat. Where are the parasites found? The parasites are found in cats, especially those that eat rodents or birds. They are also found in the brain and muscles of sheep, goats, swine, cattle, chickens and other birds. How long can the parasites cause infection? The parasites can survive in fresh cat feces and infect people for 1 - 5 days. Parasites in water or moist soil can in fect for up to one year. Infected raw meats can contain the parasite. Freezing does not kill the parasite. Can a person get toxoplasmosis again? Healthy people probably cannot become infected again. However, immunosuppressed people can become ill again . What is the treatment for toxoplasmosis? Infections are not treated unless they occur in pregnant women. How can toxoplasmosis be prevented? 1. Always cook meat completely. Never eat raw meat. Freezing meat does not kill the parasites. 2. Feed cat's dry, canned, or boiled food. Do not allow them to hunt rodents or birds for food. 3. Dispose of cat feces and litter daily. Wear gloves when emptying and disinfecting litter pans. Do not shake dried used litter or breathe the dust from it. 4. Pregnant women should not clean litter pans and should avoid all contact with cats who have ever hunted rodents for food. 5. Carefully wash hands with soap and warm water before eating, after handling cats or cleaning litter pans, and afte r handling raw meats. Wear gloves when gardening. 6. Do not allow cats in sandboxes or sand piles used by children for play. Cover sandboxes when not in use.

Agent : Varicella- Zoster is a member of the herpesvirus family. B. Clinical Description Symptoms : Primary infection results in varicella (chickenpox). A mild prodrome may precede the onset of a rash. Adults may have 1 to 2 days of mild fever and malaise. Prior to rash onset, but in children the rash is often the first sign of disease. The rash is generalized, pruritic, and rapidly progresses from macules to papules to vesicular lesions before crusting. The rash typically consists of 250 to 500 lesions; appear first on the scalp, moves to the trunk, and then the extremities, with the highest concentration of lesions on the trunk (centripetal distribution). The vesicles are superficial and delicate; contain clear fluid on an erythematous base. Usually 2 to 4 successive crops of lesions, crops appear over several days, with lesions present in several stages of development. The rash is self- limited, generally lasting 4 -5 days. The clinical course in normal children is generally mild, with malaise, pruritus, and fever up to 102 o F for 2-3 days. Adults may have more severe disease and have a higher incidence of complications. Respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms are absent. Complications : The risk of complications from varicella varies with age. Children with lesions due to varicella are at greater risk for secondary bacterial infections. Complications are infrequent among healthy children. They are much higher in persons > 15 years and infants < 1 year of age. Adults account for only 5% of reported cases of varicella, but account for approximately 35% of mortality. Complications include bacterial superinfection of the skin lesions, pneumonia (viral or bacterial), thrombocytopenia, arthritis, hepatitis, cerebellar ataxia, encephalitis, meningitis, and glomerulonephritis. Reye Syndrome can follow some cases of chickenpox, although the incidence of Reye Syndrome has decreased dramati cally with decreased use of salicylates during varicella or influenza -like illnesses. Severe and even fatal varicella has been reported in otherwise healthy children receiving intermittent courses of corticosteroids for treatment of asthma and other illnesses. The h ospitalization rate is 3 per 1000 cases. Death rate 1 per 60,000 cases. Outcome : Recovery from primary varicella infection usually results in lifetime immunity. In otherwise healthy persons, a second occurrence of chickenpox is uncommon, but ma y occur, particularly in immunocompromised persons. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Varicella 1 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting The virus establishes latency in the dorsal root ganglia during in herpes zoster \"shingles\". Grouped vesicular lesions appear in the distribution of 1 to 3 sensory dermatomes, sometimes accompanied by pain localized to the area. The immunologic mechanism that controls latency of VZV is not well understood. Approximately 15 -30% of the population will experience zoster during their lifetimes. Factors associated with recurrent disease include aging, immunosuppression, intrauterine exposure to VZV, and varicella at a young age < 18 months. Post herpetic neuralgia is defined as pain that persists after resolution of the rash, may last as long as a year after the episode o f zoster. Herpes Zoster Vaccine Zoster vaccine (licensed in 2006 Zostavax) is a live attenuated vaccine approved for persons 60 years of age and older. ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommends a single dose of zoster vaccine for adults 60 years of age or older whether or not they report a prior episode of herpes zoster. Persons with a chronic medical condition may be vaccinated unless a contraindication or precaution exists for the condition. For more information on zoster vaccine , visit: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd -vac/shingles/default.htm#clinical The vaccine should be stored frozen at an average temperature of +5\u00b0F (- 15\u00b0C) until it is reconstituted. Read and follow the package insert for storage and reconstitution instructions . A person should not get shingles vaccine who: has ever had a life -threatening allergic reaction to gelatin , the antibiotic neomycin , or any other component of shingles vaccine . has a weakened immune system because of HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system, treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy, a history of cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma. has active, untreated tuberculosis . C. Reservoirs Humans are the only source of infection for this highly contagious virus. D. Modes of Transmission Spread: The varicella zoster virus enter s the body through the respiratory tract and conjunctiva. The virus is believed to replicate at the site of entry in the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes. Primary viremia occurs 4 -6 days after infection, which disseminates the virus to other organs, su ch as the liver, spleen and sensory ganglia. A secondary viremia occurs with viral infection of the skin. Person -to-person transmission occurs by airborne spread from respiratory tract secretions and by direct contact with drainage from lesions in patient s with varicella . Patients with zoster spread disease primarily by direct contact with drainage from zoster lesions. Transmission may also occur by respiratory contact with airborne droplets or by direct contact or inhalation of aerosols from vesicular fluid of skin lesions of acute varicella or zoster. Patients with disseminated zoster may also transmit disease via the airborne route. In utero infection also can occur as a result of transplacental passage of virus during maternal varicella infection. E. Incu bation period: The incubation period is from 14 to 16 days from exposure with a range of 10 to 21 days. Incubation may be prolonged in immunocompromised patients. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Varicella 2 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting F. Period of Communicability or Infectious Period: Patients are most contagious from 1 to 2 days before to shortly after onset of the rash. Contagiousness persists until crusting of the lesions. G. Epidemiology: Varicella is highly infectious, with secondary infection rates in susceptible household contacts approaching 90%. Secondary family cas es may have more severe disease than that in the index case. In temperate climates varicella is a childhood disease with a marked seasonal distribution with peak incidence during winter and early spring. In tropical climates, the epidemiology of varicella is different; acquisition of disease occurs at later ages, resulting in a higher proportion of adults being susceptible to varicella compared with adults in temperate climates. In the prevaccine era (prior to 1995), most cases of varicella in the United States occurred in children younger than 10. With the implementation of universal immunization, a higher proportion of cases are expected to occur among adolescents and adults . As vaccine coverage increases and the incidence of wild- type varicella decreas es, a higher proportion of varicella cases will occur in immunized people as break -through disease. In sites conducting active surveillance, cases of breakthrough disease have increased as a percentage of all cases from 4% in 1995 to 25% in 2000. This shou ld not be confused as an increasing rate of breakthrough disease or as evidence of increasing vaccine failure. H. Bioterrorist Potential: None - differentiate from smallpox. 2) DISEASE REPORTING AND CASE INVESTIGATION A. Purpose of Surveillance and Reporti ng: Varicella is not currently a nationally notifiable disease, and surveillance data are limited. B. Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: Positive serologic test for varicella- zoster immunoglobulin varicella- zoster (VZV ), demonstration of VZV antigen by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests from a clinical specimen. Significant rise in serum varicella immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody level by any standard serological assay. C. Local Public Health Agency Follow -up Responsibilities Outbreak Investigation: A parent letter and varicella outbreak worksheet is available to help in an outbreak response. Case investigation of all suspected cases of varicella is not feasible or ne cessary. Reporting of varicella outbreaks (child care centers, schools, institutions etc.) will facilitate public health action. In addition, in certain high -risk settings (e.g., hospitals and other health -care settings) rapid case identification and publ ic health action are important to prevent infection of susceptible persons at high risk for serious complications of varicella, such as immunocompromised persons and susceptible pregnant women. Pre-licensure vaccine efficacy studies ranged from 70- 90% for all disease and > 95% for severe disease while mild \"breakthrough\" varicella may be expected to occur in 10 -20% of vaccinated children. T he rate of varicella (mild or severe) among vaccinated children should be monitored; if the rate of breakthrough disease is higher than expected (e.g., > 30%) the cause of the problem should be investigated. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Varicella 3 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting \"Breakthrough disease\" is defined as a case of wild -type varicella infection occurring more than 42 days after vaccination. The disease is almost always mild with fewer than 50 skin lesions. Rash may be atypical maculopapular with few or no vesicles. Breakthrough disease is contagious. 3) CONTROLLING FURTHER SPREAD A. Isolation and Quarantine Requirements: Isolation (exclusion) or cohorting of individuals with varicell a until all of their lesions have crusted is routinely recommended for outbreak control. However, because substantial transmission of chickenpox occurs before rash onset, exclusion may have limited value as an outbreak control measure. Quarantine measures: none. Exclusion is also recommended for exposed susceptible individuals, who may be in contact with persons at high risk of serious complications (e.g., health -care workers, family members of immunocompromised persons). In these situations, exclusion is required for the duration of the period of communicability (i.e., from the 10 th until the 21st day post -exposure). B. Protection of Contacts of a Case: Epidemiologic and serologic studies confirm that greater than 90% of adults are immune to VZV. Rates of immunity may be lower for adults who were raised in certain tropical or subtropical areas. Vaccination for Outbreak Control : During a varicella outbreak, persons who have received one dose of varicella vaccine should, resources permitting, receive a s econd dose provided the appropriate vaccination interval has elapsed since the first vaccine. (Three month interval for persons 12 months through 12 years of age and at least a 28 day interval for persons 13 years of age and older.) Varicella vaccine , if administered within 72 hours and possibly up to 120 hours following varicella exposure , may prevent or significantly modify disease. If exposure to varicella does not cause infection, post -exposure vaccination with varicella vaccine should induce protection against subsequent infection. If the exposure results in infection, the vaccine may reduce the severity of the disease. There is no evidence that administration of varicella vaccine during the incubation period of illness increases the risk for vaccine -associated adverse events. Antivirals may be considered for persons at increased risk of moderate to severe disease. The decision to use antiviral therapy and the route and duration of therapy should be determined by specific host factors, extent of infection, and initial response to therapy. Antiviral drugs have a limited window of opportunity to affect the outcome of Varicella -zoster infection. In immunocompetent hosts, most virus replication has stopped by 72 hours after onset of rash; the duration is extended in immunocompromised hosts. Oral acyclovir is not recommended for routine use in otherwise healthy children with varicella. Administration within 24 hours of the onset of rash results in only a modest decrease in symptoms. A 7-day course of acyclovir may be given to susceptible adults beginning 7 to 9 days after varicella exposure if vaccine is contraindicated or more than 72 hours has elapsed from the time of exposure. (Most adults with no or uncertain history of chickenpox are nonetheless immune ). Oral acyclovir sho uld be considered for people at increased risk of moderate to severe v aricella, such as people older than 12 years of age, people with chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorders, people receiving long -term salicylate therapy, and people receiving short, intermittent, or aerosolized courses of corticosteroids. Some experts also recommend use of oral acyclovir for secondary household cases in which the disease usually is more severe than in the primary case. Oral acyclovir is not recommended routinely for pregnant women with uncomplicated Varicella, because the risks Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Varicella 4 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting and benefits to the fetus and mother are unknown. Intravenous acyclovir is recommended for the pregnant patient with serious complications of varicella. Children with varicella should not receive salicylates or salicylate -containing products, because administration of salicylates to such children increases the risk of Reye syndrome. Acetaminophen may be used for control of fever. Varicella zoster immune globulin (V ariZIG): This is recommended for post -exposure prophylaxis of susceptible persons who are at high risk for developing severe disease and when varicella vaccine is contraindicated. VariZIG is most effective in preventing varicella infection when given within 96 hours of varicella exposure; for maximum effectiveness it should be given as soon as possible after exposure. The decision to administer VariZIG to a person exposed to varicella should be based on 1) whether the person is susceptible, 2) whether the exposure is likely to result in infection, and 3) whether the patient is at greater risk for complications than the general public. Such groups include: Newborn infants whose mothers developed varicella around the time of delivery (< 5 days before to 2 days after d elivery), Immunocompromised children without history of varicella or varicella immunization. Susceptible pregnant women, Hospitalized premature infants > 28 weeks gestation whose mother had no history of varicella, and Premature infants < 28 weeks gestati on, regardless of the mother's history of varicella. VariZIG can be ordered from the distributor (FFF Enterprises, Inc., Temecula, CA) by calling 800 -843- 7477. Vari ZIG is given by intramuscular (IM) injection and contains between 10% and 18% Globulin and does not contain thimerosal. One vial (approximate volume, 1.25 ml) containing 125 U is given for each 10 kg of body weight and is the minimal dose. The suggested maximal dose of V ariZIG is 625 U ( i.e., 5 vials). For more information , visit: www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6112a4.htm C. Managing Special Situations Prenatal & Perinatal exposure: Women should be assessed prenatally for evidence of varicella immunity. Upon completion or termination of their pregnancies, women who do not have evidence of varicella immunity should receive the first dose of vaccine before discharge from the healthcare facility. The second dose should be administered 4 to 8 weeks later at the postpartum or other healthcare visit. Prenatal infection is uncommon because most women of childbearing age are immune to VZV. Fetal infection after maternal varicella during the first or early second trimester of pregnancy occasionally results in varicella embryop athy, which is characterized by limb atrophy and scarring of the skin of the extremities (congenital varicella syndrome). Central nervous system and eye manifestations also can occur. The incidence of congenital varicella syndrome among infants born to mot hers with varicella is approximately 2% when infection occurs before 20 weeks of gestation. Children exposed to varicella -zoster virus in utero during the second 20 weeks of pregnancy can develop inapparent v aricella and subsequent zoster early in life without having had extra uterine varicella. Varicella infection can be fatal for an infant if the mother develops v aricella from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Varicella 5 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting When v aricella develops in a mother more than 5 days before delivery and gestational ag e is 28 weeks or more, the severity of disease in the newborn is modified by transplacental transfer of varicella- zoster virus (VZV ) specific maternal IgG antibody of the parent . Hospitalized Patient : In addition to Standard Precautions, Airborne and Con tact Precautions are recommended for patients with v aricella for a minimum of 5 days after onset of the rash and as long as vesicular lesions are present, which in immunocompromised patients can be a week or longer. For exposed susceptible patients, Airbor ne and Contact Precautions from 10 until 21 days after exposure to the index patient also are indicated; these precautions should be maintained until 28 days or longer after exposure for those who received V ariZIG. Immunocompromised patients who have zoster (localized or disseminated) and immunocompetent patients wi th disseminated zoster require Airborne and Contact P recautions for the duration of illness. For immunocompetent p atients with localized zoster, Contact Precautions are indicated until all lesio ns are crusted. Healthcare worker : The Advisory Committee on immunization Practices recommends that all healthcare workers be immune to varicella, either from a reliable history of disease or from vaccination. In a health - care institution serologic scre ening of personnel who have a negative or uncertain history of varicella is likely to be cost effective. All susceptible exposed personnel should be furloughed or excused from patient contact from day 10 to day 21 after exposure to an infectious patient . The interval should be extended to 28 days or longer for people who have received VariZIG. Varicella immunization is recommended for susceptible personnel if varicella does not develop from the exposure. Serologic testing for immunity is not necessary f or personnel who have been immunized, because 99% of adults are seropositive after the second vaccine dose. Outbreaks involving children covered by childcare or school requirements : Unvaccinated children with no history of v aricella disease should be inst ructed to be vaccinated immediately or excluded from school for the duration of the period of communicability (i.e., from 10-21 days post exposure or for the duration of the outbreak. Outbreaks in child care centers or schools : The public health response includes informing parents and caregivers of the outbreak, providing them with information on v aricella and its potential to cause complications, and providing information about the availability of vaccine . Children with uncomplicated chickenpox who have been excluded from school or child care may return when the rash has crusted, or in immunized people without crusts, when lesions have faded or new lesions have appeared in the last 24 hours. Exclusion of children with zoster whose lesions cannot be covered is based on similar criteria. Children who are excluded may return when lesions are crusted. Lesions that are covered seem to pose little risk to susceptible people. Institutional outbreaks or outbreaks involving adolescents or adults : Vaccination of susceptible persons should be strongly considered because it is likely to limit or control the outbreak by interrupting transmission. Outbreak control should be considered at any stage of an outbreak if there are remaining susceptible persons. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Varicella 6 Guide to Surveillance, Investigation, and Reporting Preve ntive Measures: Vaccination The Oka/Merck attenuated v aricella vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1995. Because of the thermolability of the vaccine, the manufacturer's requirements for maintaining the cold chain must be followed strictly. Vaccin e that is not stored properly before admi nistration could have reduced potency. Recommendations for the use of v aricella virus vaccine: o Routine administration of live attenuated varicella virus vaccine for all children 12 -18 months of age. On June 2006 ACIP recommend ed a routine 2 dose varicella vaccine schedule for all children less than 13 years of age, with the first dose administered at 12 -15 months of age and the second dose at 4 -6 years of age (i.e., before a child enters kindergarten). The second dose can be administered at an earlier age provided the interval between the first and second dose is at least 3 months. However, if the second dose is administered at least 28 days following the first dose, the second dose does not need to be repeated o A second dose catch- up varicella vaccination is recommended for children, adolescents, and adults (without evidence of immunity) who previously had received only one dose, to improve individual protection against varicella and for more rapid impact on school outbreaks. The minimum interval between vaccine doses is 28 days. Catch -up vaccination can be implemented during routine health care provider visits. Children with a reliable history of typical chickenpox can be assumed to be immune to varicella. Serologic testing of such children prior to vaccination is not warranted because the majority of children between 12 months and 12 years of age without a clinical history of chickenpox are not immune. Serologic testing of adolescents and adults with an uncertain or negative history is likely to be cost -effective because 70% -90% of these individuals are likely to be varicella- immune. Serologic testing for varicella immunity following two doses of vaccine is not necessary because 99% of persons are seropositiv e after the second dose. Transmission of varicella vaccine virus Available data suggest that transmission of vaccine virus is a rare event. It appears that transmission occurs mainly and perhaps only, when the vaccinee develops a rash. If a vaccinated p erson develops a rash, it is recommended that close contact with persons who do not have evidence of varicella immunity and who are at high risk of complications of varicella, such as immunocompromised persons, be avoided until the rash has resolved. Varicella Vaccine Contraindications and Pr ecautions : o Severe a llergic reaction to vaccine component or following a prior dose o Women known to be pregnant or attempting to become pregnant should not receive varicella vaccine. Pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following receipt of varicella vaccine o Immunosuppression due to disease or medication o Moderate or severe acute illness o Recent blood product See www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00042990.htm for more information. Varicella vaccination is contraindicated for all persons with moderate or severe cellular immunodeficiency due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and is not recommended for adults who are HIV infected. However , vaccination should be considered for HIV-infected children if they have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV infection, in CDC class N, A, or B CD4+ T -lymphocyte percentage of > 15% and without evidence of varicella immunity should receive two doses of single antigen varicella vaccine at a minimum interval of three months.

Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Varicella 8 FACT causes varicella (chickenpox), when a person is first infected. After the first infection the virus stays in the body and hides in nerve cells. Herpes zoster (shingles) results from a reactivation of the hidden infection. Who gets varicella zoster/herpes zoster? Most cases of chickenpox occur in childhood. However chickenpox can occur in the 2 -8% if adults have not had the disease. Chickenpox tends to occur in late winter and early spring. Approximately 3 to 4 million cases of chickenpox occur every year in the US, 90% of which are in childr en below 4 years of age. Shingles does not seem to occur at any specific time of the year and tends to occur more frequently in patients with cancer, other immunosuppressed patients and persons under stress. How is the virus spread? The varicella zoster virus replicates in the nasopharynx or upper respiratory tract. Chickenpox is easily spread from person to person by droplet or airborne spread of respiratory tract secretions or contact with the fluid of the blisters. Contact with blister fluid from shin gle lesions can result in chickenpox in a person who has never had chickenpox, but you cannot get shingles from shingles. Shingles come from a reactivation of a previous chickenpox (varicella virus) infection. These lesions are most infectious 24 hours b efore and up to 48 hours after erupting and are generally not infectious after 7 days. What are the symptoms? The symptoms of chickenpox include generalized, itchy, rash ; blisters containing fluid, and tiredness. The blisters commonly occur in successive crops on skin and oral mucous membranes and are more abundant on covered than exposed parts of the body. Illness tends to be more severe in adults. The symptoms of shingles are eruption of blisters on one side of the body. The chest, lower back nerve r oots most commonly involved. Pain occurs in the area 48- 72 hours before developing lesions. Lesions develop over 3-5 days, lasting 10- 15 days. It may take longer for skin to return to normal. How soon do the symptoms appear? Chickenpox occurs in approx imately 2 -3 weeks after infection. How long can an infected person spread the virus? Chickenpox can be spread up to 5 days before the rash occurs and remains infectious until the blisters are crusted or dry. Shingle blisters are generally not infectiou s after 7 days. Can a person get varicella zoster/herpes zoster again? Antibodies develop and when you recover from chickenpox you generally do not get this disease again. However the virus stays hidden in the nerve cells for life. This is the cause of shingles, which may occur more than once. What is the treatment for varicella zoster/herpes zoster? Treatment is usually for immunosuppressed patients, consisting of antiviral medication. Is there a vaccine to prevent varicella (chickenpox)? Varicella vaccine was licensed in 1995 and is recommended for routine use in infants over 12 months of age and for susceptible older children, adolescents, and adults. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Varicella Health Fact Sheet 2 Children over 1 2 months of age should receive first dose of vaccine with a second dose is routine ly given at 4- 6 years. Those 12 years or younger who have not received a second dose should get one at least 3 months after the first dose. Susceptible persons 13 years of age or older require 2 doses of vaccine separated by an interval of a minimum of 28 days . Varicella virus vaccine provides 70 -90% protection against infection and 95% protection against severe disease. Is there a vaccine to prevent zoster (shingles)? Yes there is a vaccine for persons 60 years of age or older. Check with your healthca re provider.

After the first infection the virus stays in the body and hides in nerve cells. Herpes zoster (shingles) results from a reactivation of the individual's first infection. Who gets varicella zoster/herpes zoster? Most cases of chickenpox occur in childhood. However chickenpox can occur in the 2-8% of adults who have not had the disease. Chickenpox tends to occur in late winter and early spring. Approximately 3 to 4 million cases of chickenpox occur every year in the U .S., 90% of which are in children under 4 years of age. Shingles does not seem to occur at any specific time of the year and tends to occur more frequently in patients with cancer, other immunosuppressed patients and persons under stress. How is the virus spread? The varicella zoster virus replicates in the nasopharynx or upper respiratory tract. Chickenpox is easily spread from person to person by droplet or airborne spread of respiratory tract secretions or contact with the fluid of the lesions. Contact with vesicular fluid from shingle lesions can result in chickenpox in a person who has never had chickenpox. What are the symptoms? The symptoms of chickenpox include generalized itchy vesicular rash consisting of 250 -500 lesions, mild fever and tiredness. The lesions commonly occur in successive crops on skin and oral mucous membranes and are more abundant on covered than exposed parts of the body. Disease severity and complications are increased among immunoc ompromised persons, neonates, and children less th an one year of age, and adults. The symptoms of shingles are eruption of vesicles on one side of the body. The chest, lower back nerve roots most commonly involved. Pain occurs in the area 48 -72 hours b efore developing lesions. How soon do the symptoms appear? Chickenpox occurs approximately 2 -3 weeks after exposure in a susceptible person. How long can an infected person spread the virus? Chickenpox can be spread up to 2 days before the rash occurs and remains infectious until the lesions are crusted or dry or until the rash is faded away and no new rash appears for a 24 -hour period. Shingle lesions are generally not infectious after 7 days. How are susceptible staff members impacted after a significant exposure to chickenpox or shingles? All susceptible health -care workers should ensure that they are immune to varicella. In healthcare institutions serologic screening of personnel who have a negative or uncertain history of varicella is likely t o be cost effective. All susceptible exposed personnel should be furloughed or excused from patient contact from day 10 to day 21 after exposure to an infectious patient. The interval should be extended to 28 days or longer for people who have received VZ IG. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Varicella Health Professional Fact Sheet 2 Varicella immunization is recommended for susceptible personnel if varicella does not develop from exposure. Serologic testing for immunity is not necessary for personnel who have been immunized, because 99% of adults are seropositive after the second vaccine dose. What are the criteria for significant exposure to chickenpox? Exposure window is 48 hours prior to developing lesions and continues until lesions are crusted or u ntil the rash is faded away and no new rash appears for a 24 -hour period. What are the criteria for significant exposure to shingles? Direct contact with skin lesion is required. Lesions covered with clothing would not be a significant exposure. Unusual or prolonged contact with patient's bedclothes (during bed changes or bed baths) or assisting patients into whirlpools, etc. without gloves as a barrier may be considered exposure. Shingle lesions are generally not infectious after 7 days. What are chickenpox isolation guidelines? Isolate in a private room and use airborne and Contact isolation Precautions until lesions are crusted or until the rash is faded away and no new rash appears for a 24 -hour period. Any employee who is susceptible should not care for patients diagnosed with chickenpox or shingles. What are shingles isolation guidelines? Localized lesions in immunocompromised patient or disseminated (>2 dermatomes) use Airborne and Contact isolation P recautions. Localized lesions in normal patient use Standard P recautions. Can a person get varicella again? Antibodi es develop ed during initial infection generally prevent a person from getting Chickenpox again. However the virus lies dormant in the dorsal ganglia for life. Can a person get herpes zoster again? Yes, the varicella virus lies dormant in the dorsal gan glia and is the cause of shingles, which may occur more than once. What is the treatment for varicella? Treatment with antivirals may be considered for persons at increased risk for moderate to severe disease. Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG) is recommended for post -exposure prophylaxis of susceptible persons who are at high risk of developing severe disease (e.g., immunocompromised children, susceptible pregnant women, prematur e infants < 28 weeks gestation) and when varicella vaccine is contrai ndicated. What is the treatment for herpes zoster ? Treatment with antivirals may be considered for persons at increased risk for moderate to severe disease. Is there a vaccine to prevent varicella (chickenpox)? Varicella vaccine was licensed in 1995 and is recommended for routine use in infants and for susceptible older children, adolescents, and adults. Children ages one through 12 years need two doses of vaccine at least 3 months apart . Persons 13 years of age and older require 2 d oses of vaccine separated by a minimum of 28 days. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Reviewed 10/12 Varicella Health Professional Fact Sheet 2 Dear Parents: Your child's school/childcare, (insert name), has recently reported several cases of chickenpox. Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a very contagious disease caused by a virus. Below you will find information about the disease and wha t you should do if your child becomes sick. Who gets Chickenpox? This virus usually infects children. Older children and adults can also become infected if they haven't already h ad chickenpox (or been vaccinated against it). My child received the varicella vaccine, can they still get chickenpox? Yes, this is called \"breakthrough chickenpox\". The vaccine your child received is 70 -90% effective against preventing severe chickenpox . \"Breakthrough chickenpox\" that develops in a vaccinated person is usually mild and does not last as long. What if my child has never had chickenpox disease or the varicella vaccine? Your child should be vaccinated. Is it is safe to vaccinate my chi ld after exposure to chickenpox disease? Yes, this may help prevent the disease or result in a milder case of chickenpox. Vaccinations for your child are offered at medical clinics (your child's regular doctor) or at your local public health agency. How is the virus spread? Chickenpox is easily spread through the air by sneezing and coughing or through contact with someone's chickenpox rash. Your child may become sick anytime up to 2 weeks after coming in contact with someone with chickenpox. What are the symptoms? In unvaccinated children early symptoms may include aching, fever, sore throat, upper respiratory infection, poor appetite, headache, and tiredness for 1 -2 days before the appearance of the rash. If your child has been vaccinated symptoms may include a mild fever and rash. The rash may look red like a bug bite but not have a blister. Please remember even though your child was vaccinated if they develop a rash they can spread it to others. How long does my child need to stay out of school/c hild care? Chickenpox is spread several days before the rash appears. Your child should be kept home until all of the rash is crusted over or faded away and no new rash appears for a 24- hour period. Who do I tell if my child has chickenpox? Please let the school/child care know if your child is out due to chickenpox . If you have any concerns about your child's health please contact your healthcare provider. Please feel free to contact our office at ( insert phone number here) with any questions and concerns!

If additional cases are identified 2-months after the last case, that will need to be reported as a new outbreak. Number of Lesions* Check the appropriate box 4. School nurse, parent, or physician diagnoses of Varicella are acceptable. Outbreak Definition *Determining the Number of Lesions: 1. CDC definition of an outbreak: the occurrence of 2 or more varicella cases that are epidemiologically linked (e.g., where person-to-person transmission is suggested). 2. An outbreak is considered ended when no new cases occur within 2 months after the last case is no longer contagious. Cases are contagious until all lesions have crusted over or faded away, Varicella Outbreak Worksheet 1. Less than 50 lesions (all could be counted in 30 seconds or less). 2. 50-249: lesions far enough apart to be able to place child's hand on skin and not touch a lesion. 3. 250-500: Lesions so numerous unable to place child's hand on skin without touching a lesion. 4. Over 500: No normal skin is visible. An illness with acute onset of diffuse (generalized) maculopapulovesicular rash without other apparent cause. In vaccinated persons, who develop varicella more than 42 days after vaccination (breakthrough disease), the disease is almost always mild with fewer than 50 skin lesions and shorter duration of illness. The rash may also be atypical in appearance (maculopapular with few or no vesicles).Varicella Clinical Case DefinitionFACT SHEET VIRAL MENINGITIS What is viral meningitis? Meningitis is swelling of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Viral meningitis is relatively common. Many different viruses can cause viral meningitis. Coxsackievirus and echovirus, both members of the enterovirus group, are responsible for the majority of identified viral meningitis cases in the United States. Adenovirus, mumps, and varicella (chickenpox) can meningitis. What are the symptoms of viral meningitis? Illness is generally characterized by fever, stiff neck, headache, nausea and vomiting, and sometimes a rash. Other gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms have been reported by those infected with enteroviruses. Illness typically resolves within 10 days and most individuals have a complete recovery. How soon do symptoms appear? For most enteroviruses symptoms appear in 3 to 6 days. How is viral meningitis spread? Most viruses that cause meningitis are transmitted primarily from person -to-person. Person -to-person transmission modes vary, depending on the particular virus. They may be transmitted from: hand to mouth (enteroviruses), airborne transmission (measles, varicella), gets viral meningitis? Anyone can get viral meningitis. For how long is a person infectious? Enteroviruses may be shed in feces for several days to many weeks after symptoms have resolved. Enteroviruses may also be shed in respiratory secretions, usually for no longer than 1 week following symptoms. What is the treatment for this illness? No specific treatment for viral meningitis exists at this time. Most patients completely recover without treatment. Doctors often will recommend bed rest, plenty of fluids, and medication to relieve fever and headache. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or child care? Infected persons can return to school, work, or child care as soon as they feel well enough. For those viruses that are transmitted from hand to mouth or by respiratory droplet such as mumps or measles, infected people may be excluded from school or child care depending on the specific virus causing the disease. What can b e done to help prevent the spread of these viruses? Since most forms of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses, which are shed in a persons stool, individuals should be advised to practice good hygiene, especially frequent and thorough handwashing. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Rev iewed 10/12 Viral Meningitis Fact Sheet 1 FACT SHEET VIRAL RESPIRATORY ILLNESS (Influenza, Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, common cold) What are these viruses? There are probably hundreds of variants of viruses that cause upper respiratory disease, colds, etc. As a group of viruses, they can cause economic loss, personal suffering, and even death. What are the symptoms of an infection with these viruses? Many of these viruses will invade any part of the respiratory tract. Common symptoms are runny nose, cough, sneezing, and respirat ory distress. How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms can occur between 12 hours and 5 days after infection. How are these viruses spread? Viruses are spread by direct contact with someone who is ill by contact with airborne droplets when they cough or sn eeze, and probably most importantly, by indirect contact with soiled tissues or contaminated hands carrying viruses to the eyes and nose. Who gets these infections? Everyone is susceptible to viral respiratory illness, especially considering there are so many different kinds of these viruses. How long is a person infectious? People are able to spread these viruses from 24 hours before illness to five days after the illness begins. What are the treatments for these illnesses? Antibiotics work on bacteria not viruses and therefore are ineffective against influenza. In some cases, physicians may use anti -viral drugs for chronically ill children or adults. Do infected people need to be excluded from school, work, or daycare? No, but ill people should use re spiratory etiquette so they do NOT expose others. What can be done to help prevent the spread of these viruses? Handwashing is the single most important means to prevent infecting yourself and to prevent the spread of disease from you to someone else. Cover your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing with disposable tissues. If tissues are not available, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve rather than your hands. Wash your hands whenever possible after coughing or sneezing. Make an ample supply of facial tissues readily available to all persons, and an easily accessible container for proper disposal of tissues. Avoid crowded living and sleeping quarters, when possible. Provide adequate ventilation. Clean common use surfaces such as door handles, hand rails, and eating surfaces frequently with household disinfectant. Avoid smoking in households and other public environments, especially around infants, small children, and anyone with lung conditions such as asthma. Stay at home if experiencing moderate to severe upper respiratory symptoms (such as frequent coughing and sneezing) to prevent spread to others. Consult with your physician if you experience severe cough, symptoms lasting more than a few days, fever equal to or higher than 101 \u00b0 F, rash, severe headache or difficulty breathing. Get an influenza vaccine every year and ask your doctor about the pneumococcal vaccine.

Antigen - That part of an agent (bacteria, virus, etc.) capable of stimulating the production of specific antibodies. Antibody - An immunoglobulin found in tissue fluids and blood serum that is produced in response to the stimulus of a specific antigen and is capable of combining with that antigen to neutralize or destroy it. Airborne precautions - Precautions that apply to patients known or suspected to be infected with epidemiologically important pathogens that c an be transmitted widely by air currents and may become inhaled by or deposited on a susceptible host within the same room or, depending on environmental factors, over a longer distance from the source patient. These precautions are designed to reduce the risk of such airborne transmission of infectious agents through personal protection devices, such as N95 masks, and special air handling and ventilation systems, such as airborne infection isolation rooms. (Adapted from CDC/HICPAC guidelines.) Airborne infection isolation room (AIIR ) - A single patient room in which environmental factors are controlled to minimize the transmission of infectious agents that can be transmitted by the airborne route. These rooms have specific requirements for controlled ventilation, negative pressure, and air filtration and monitoring that are detailed in Guideline for Environmental Infection Control in Health -Care Facilities, 2003. Arthralgia - Pain in a joint without objective signs (see arthritis). Arthritis - Swelling, redness, tenderness, or other specific signs of inflammation in a joint. Aseptic - Absence of infectious microorganisms; free from infection; sterile. (Sometimes used to mean absence of bacteria, example; aseptic meningitis may be caused by virus). Asymptomatic - Without objective evidence of disease or condition. Attack Rate - A measure of the frequency of cases of a disease in a narrowly defined population during a specific interval of time, as in epidemics (# of cases/# of people exposed x 100). Usually expressed as a percent. Bacteria - Unicellular microorganism. There are three principal forms: spherical or ovoid forms called cocci; rod-shaped forms called bacilli or vibrios; and spiral forms called spirilla or spirochetes. Bioemergency - A situation in which a pathogen poses an immediate and severe threat to the lives or health of people in Iowa, to the extent that day -to-day operations of public health authorities are insufficient to address this threat. Carrier - A pers on or animal that harbors a specific infectious agent (but manifests no discernible clinical disease) and is a potential source of Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi sed 04 /11 Glossary 2 Iowa Department of Public Health infection for man or animals. The carrier state can occur in an individual after an infection (which was either asymptomatic or symptomatic and resolved). Case - An infected or diseased person or animal having specific clinical, laboratory, or epidemiologic characteristics. Case Definition - A set of standard criteria for deciding whether a person has a particular disease or health -related condition, by specifying clinical criteria and limitations on time, place, and person (Retrieved from CDC at www.cdc.gov/osels/ph_surveillance/nndss/casedef/index.htm on 3/15/11 ). Case Fatality Rate - A measure of the likelihood that an ill person ( i.e., one who exhibits symptoms) will die as a result of that illness (adapted from Gordis, 2000:44); can be expressed by the ratio: number who die within a specified time after disease onset or diagnosis number ill Chemoprophylaxis - The administration of a medicine, including antibiotics, to prevent the development of an infection or prevent the progression of an infection to clinical disease. Example: Rifampin for exposure to meningococcal disease. Cohort - Any defined group of persons selected for a special purpose or study. (From the Latin cohors, warriors, the tenth part of a legion). Cohorting - Method to isolate separate infectiou s persons fr om susceptible ones by grouping persons with the same infection together. Cohorting of staff is to assign specific staff to a group of patients and not have them do care on the unaffected clients. Colonization - Propagation of a microorganism on or within a host without causing cellular injury or infection. A colonized host can serve as a source of infection. Carriers are often said to be colonized with a pathogen. Communicable Disease - An illness which is caused by a specific infectious agent or its toxic products, and which arises through transmission of that agent or its products from a reservoir to a susceptible host. Complement - A chemical in the immune system which can provoke the disintegration of bacteria. It is present in all se ra. Complement is not an antibody but may work with antibodies to destroy bacteria. Contact - A person or animal that has been in such association with an infected person or animal, or a contaminated environment, as to have had an opportunity to acquir e the etiologic agent. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi sed 04 /11 Glossary 3 Iowa Department of Public Health Contact Precautions - Precautions that apply to patients known or suspected to be infected or colonized with epidemiologically important microorganisms that can be transmitted by direct or indirect contact. Direct -contact transmis sion involves skin -to-skin contact and physical transfer of microorganisms to a susceptible host from an infected or colonized person, while indirect - contact transmission involves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object. (Ada pted from CDC/HICPAC guidelines.) Culture - The growth of microorganisms on or in substances (especially laboratory media prepared for this purpose). Droplets - Liquid particles expelled into the air during the act of talking, spitting, singing, coughing, or sneezing. Droplets are formed through aerosolization of secretions present in the mouth, nasopharynx and bronchi. They can contain infectious microorganisms. Droplet Nuclei - The dried residues of droplets which may contain one or more infecti ous microorganisms. In contrast to droplets, droplet nuclei can remain suspended in the air for long periods. Droplet Precautions - Precautions that apply to any patient known or suspected to be infected with epidemiologically important pathogens that can be transmitted by infectious droplets generated from the source person during coughing, sneezing, or talking or during the performance of certain procedures such as suctioning or bronchoscopy. Unlike airborne precautions, because droplets travel only short distances ( < 3 ft.) and do not remain suspended in the air, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent droplet transmission. (Adapted from CDC/HICPAC guidelines.) Ecchymosis - A large, irregularly formed hemorrhagic area of skin. Like a large bruise the color is blue -black changing to a greenish -brown or yellow. May occur with a large bruise. Epidemic - The occurrence of cases of a disease in human populations in a particular geographic area clearly in excess of the usua l incidence. Common -source epidemic - An epidemic in which one human or one animal or specific vehicle (e.g., food or water) is responsible for transmitting the agent to the case/s identified. Point-source epidemic - like a common source but limited to a short time period (e.g., a meal). Propagated -source epidemic - An epidemic in which infections are transmitted from person to person or animal to animal in such a fashion that identified cases cannot be attributed to a single source. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi sed 04 /11 Glossary 4 Iowa Department of Public Health Epidemiologist - A person who applies epidemiologic principles and methods to the prevention and control of disease. Epidemiology - The study of the distribution and causes/risk factors of disease in human populations. Epidemiologically linked case - A case in which a) the patient has had contact with one or more persons who either have/had the disease or have been exposed to a point source of infection (i.e., a single source of infection, such as an event leading to a foodborne -disease outbreak, to which all confirmed case-patients were exposed) and b) transmission of the agent by the usual modes of transmission is plausible. A case may be considered epidemiologically linked to a laboratory -confirmed case if at least one case in the chain of transmission is laboratory con firmed. Erythema - Redness of the skin due to capillary dilatation. Etiology - The study or theory of the causes of disease. An etiologic agent is that which causes disease. Exposure - The opportunity of a susceptible host to acquire an infection by either a direct or indirect mode of transmission. Example: being bitten by an ill skunk is a potential exposure to rabies. Fomites - Inanimate objects, such as toys or articles of clothing, which can become contaminated and, therefore, be a vehicl e for transmission. Fungi - Simple, dependent plants including molds, rusts, mushrooms, toadstools, lichens and yeasts. Some forms are pathogenic to animals. Example: vaginal \"yeast infections\". Hand Hygiene - A general term that applies to hand washing, antiseptic handwash, antiseptic hand rub, or surgical hand antisepsis. (CDC) Health Care Provider - A person who is trained and licensed to give health care. Also, a place licensed to give health care. Doctors, nurses, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, some assisted living facilities and certain kinds of home health agencies are examples of health care providers. (From the Medicare web site.) Host - Organisms, including human s, that are capable of being infected by a specific agent. Hypothesis - An unproven assertion or statement based on available information, which commonly deals with the identity of an etiologic agent, the source of infection and the mode of transmission. Its role is to provide a rational basis for further investigation. Illness - A subjective state, or experience, characterized by the impairment of normal physiological function and affecting part or all of an organism Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi sed 04 /11 Glossary 5 Iowa Department of Public Health (Last, 2001:90 and Princeton University, retrieved 3/10/04). Immune Globulin - A sterile s olution of proteins made up of antibodies that are present in adult human blood. Example: RIG - rabies immune globulin. Immunoglobulin - A protein that functions as an antigen receptor. Immunity - Immunity is often used to refer to antibody statu s. Passive immunity refers to antibodies acquired from an outside source either naturally (by maternal transfer) or artificially (by inoculation of specific protective antibodies -- convalescent or immune serum, or immune globulin). Passive immunity is of brief duration (days or months). Active immunity lasts years, and is acquired either naturally (by actual infection), or artificially (by inoculation with a vaccine). Immunodeficient - Lacking in the ability to mount an immune response in response to an antigen. Incidence - Number of new cases of a disease occurring within a particular population during a specified period of time. Index Case - The first case among a number of similar cases which are epidemiologically related. Index cases are oft en identified as a source of contamination or infection. Induration - Extremely hard or firm tissue (e.g. what is measured in a reactive Tuberculin skin test) Infection - The entry and multiplication of an infectious agent in body tissues of man or animal, resulting in cellular injury. Infectious Agent - An organism, usually a microorganism but including larger parasites (such as worms), that is capable of producing infection or infectious disease. Infectious Disease - A disease of man or animal resulting from an invasion of the body by pathogenic agents and the reaction of the tissues to these agents and/or the toxins they produce. Infection Control Precautions - Measures used for decreasing the risk of transmission of microorganisms, particularly in health care facilities or when otherwise providing medical care. These fall into standard, contact, droplet, and airborne categories, which are also defined in this section. (Adapted from CDC/HICPAC guidelines) Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi sed 04 /11 Glossary 6 Iowa Department of Public Health Infectivity - A measure of the lik elihood that a person exposed to a pathogen will become infected (i.e., the agent enters, multiplies, and survives within the host) (adapted from Nelson, 2001:27); can be expressed by the ratio: number infected _ number exposed Infestation - The lodgment, development, and reproduction of arthropods (e.g., scabies, lice on the body or in the clothing.) Inflammation - Normal tissue response to cellular injury or foreign material, characterized by dilation of small blood vessels (capillaries) t hat usually cause erythema (redness) and warmth and mobilization of defense cells (blood and tissue white blood cells that form pus). Isolation - The separation, for the period of communicability, of infected persons or animals from those that are not infected, in such places and under such conditions as will prevent the direct or indirect transmission of the infectious agent from those infected to those who may be susceptible or who may spread the agent to others. Mean - Called \"the average\" in arithmetic. The mean is calculated by adding together all the observed values and dividing by the number of observations. Monospot - Agglutination test to detect the Epstein -Barr virus (the cause of mononucleosis). Morbidity - Any departure from a state of well -being. Myalgias - Tenderness or pain in the muscles. Nanometer - One billionth of a meter. Nosocomial Infection - An infection resulting from exposure to a source within a health -care facility. The term is applied to such infections transmitted between inpatients, visitors, and hospital personnel. Nosocomial - A term used to denote a new disease or condition acquired within a healthcare setting, for example a hospital -acquired infection. Outbreak - The occurrence of two or more cases of a disease which are epidemiologically related. Pandemic - An epidemic disease affecting people in several countries or continents. Example: In 1919, there was an influenza pandemic. Parasite - An organism (often microbial) which lives in or on ano ther organism, at their expense. Parasites are not necessarily harmful to their host. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi sed 04 /11 Glossary 7 Iowa Department of Public Health Pathogen - An agent capable of causing disease. Pathogenicity - The ability of an agent to cause disease in a susceptible host. Permucosal - By means of a mucous membrane. Example: Permucosal spread of hepatitis B can occur, especially in health care settings. Personal Protective Equipment - The equipment and clothing required to mitigate the risk of injury from or exposure to hazardous conditions encountered d uring the performance of duty. (From the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association) Petechiae - Small, purplish, hemorrhagic spots on the skin, mucous membranes, or serous surfaces. These are small areas under the skin, which may be due to an abnormality of blood clotting mechanism. Phagocyte - A cell which engulfs and destroys foreign particles or microorganisms by digestion. Primary Case - The person who first introduces a disease into a defined group, such as a family, and therefore the means by which members of this group may contract the disease. Compare with the definition for index case (adapted from Last, 2001:142 and Gordis, 2000:22). Prodromal Period - The prodromal period is that lapse of time between the first vague symptom of disease and the full clinical syndrome upon which a diagnosis can be based. Prophylaxis - Measures taken to prevent the development or spread of disease. Protozoa - A unicellular animal which usually reproduces asexually by fission. Public Health Disaster - Defined in Iowa Code section 135.140 as \"a state of disaster emergency proclaimed by the governor in consultation with the department [i.e., IDPH] pursuant to section 29C.6 for a disaster which specifically involves an imminent threat of an i llness or health condition that meets any of the following conditions of paragraphs I and II: I. Is reasonably believed to be caused by any of the following: a. Bioterrorism or other act of terrorism. The appearance of a novel or previously controlled or eradicated infectious agent or biological toxin. A chemical attack or accidental release. b. An intentional or accidental release of radioactive material. c. A nuclear or radiological attack or accident. II. Poses a high probability of any of the following: a. A large number of deaths in the affected population. A large number of serious or long -term disabilities in the affected population. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi sed 04 /11 Glossary 8 Iowa Department of Public Health b. Widespread exposure to an infectious or toxic agent that poses a significant risk of substantial future harm to a large number of the affected population.\" Although this statutory definition includes the conditions for a \"bio - emergency,\" as defined earlier in this section, it also encompasses conditions that are not addressed in this plan, including chemical, radioac tive, radiological, and nuclear incidents. Also, not every set of conditions that may be considered a bio -emergency by IPDH officials will result in the proclamation of a public health disaster. Purpura - A small hemorrhage in the skin, mucous membrane or serosal (serous membrane) surface which can have various manifestations. Hemorrhage into the skin becomes red, then darkens into purple, then brownish-yellow and finally disappears in 2 -3 weeks. Areas of discoloration do not disappear under fingertip pressure. Quarantine - The limitation of freedom of movement of persons or animals that have been exposed to a communicable disease, within specified limits marked by placards, for a period of time equal to the longest usual incubation period of the di sease. Ratio - A measure of the frequency of one group of events (e.g., the number of males having a specified disease) relative to the frequency of a different group of events (e.g., the number of females having the specified disease). Example: The m ale to female ratio for legionellosis is 2.5/1. Resistance - The sum total of host mechanisms which interpose barriers to invasion or multiplication of infectious agents, or that prevent damage by the agent's toxic products. Reservoir - The habit at where the etiologic agent of a disease normally thrives, grows, and replicates. A reservoir may be human (anthroponotic), animal (zoonotic), or a nonliving environment, such as soil or water (sapronotic). A characteristic feature of most diseases with non -human reservoirs is that once transmitted to humans, the epidemic chain is usually aborted, although the clinical course might be sometimes quite severe, even fatal. (Hub\u00e1lek:403). Rickettsia - A class of bacteria, which like viruses, can only multiply inside other cells. Risk - The likelihood that a person having specified characteristics (e.g., age, sex, immune status) will acquire a specified disease. Secondary Attack Rate - The frequency of new disease cases among close contacts of known cases. Secondary attack rates are usually calculated for household contacts. Example: The household secondary attack rate for Shigella can be over 50%. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi sed 04 /11 Glossary 9 Iowa Department of Public Health Sepsis - When a symptomatic person is found to have pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the b lood. Serotyping - The characterization of different strains of a microorganism by the reaction of different stocks of sera with that organism. Sign - Objective (can be detected by others) evidence of a disease. Sporadic Case - A case with no kn own epidemiological relationship to any other case(s). Standard Precautions - Precautions designed for the care of all patients in health care facilities regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status and intended to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infection. The main focus is on hand hygiene, the use of protective barriers, and the proper handling of clinical waste. The precautions apply to (1) blood; (2) all body fluids, se cretions, and excretions (except sweat), regardless of whether or not they contain visible blood; (3) non-intact skin; and, (4) mucous membranes. (Adapted from CDC/HICPAC guidelines.) Surveillance of Disease - The continuing scrutiny of the aspects of the occurrence and spread of a disease that are pertinent to effective control. Susceptible - A person or animal lacking sufficient resistance to a particular pathogenic agent to prevent disease if exposed. Symptom - Subjective (cannot be detected by o thers) evidence of a disease. Syndrome - The set of signs and symptoms which typify a particular disease. Toxin - Proteins or conjugated protein substances which can cause disease. They are produced by some higher plants, certain animals, and pathoge nic bacteria. Toxoid - A preparation containing detoxified toxin. Toxoids are used to induce specific active immunity to the related toxin. Transmission Mode - The means by which disease organisms are spread. For the purposes of this plan, the term applies to how they are spread to humans. Travel Advisory - A recommendation against nonessential travel to the area(s) for which it is issued. Travel advisories are issued when the health risk for travelers is thought to be high, and are intended to reduce the number of travelers to high-risk areas and the risk for spreading disease to other areas. (Adapted from CDC guidance). Travel Alert - A lower -level notice than a travel advisory that provides information about the disease outbreak and informs travelers how to reduce their risk of acquiring the infection. An alert does not include a recommendation against nonessential travel to the area. (Adapted from CDC guidance). Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi sed 04 /11 Glossary 10 Iowa Department of Public Health Triage - The process for sorting ill or injured people into groups based on their need for or expected benefit from medical treatment. The purpose is to provide for the efficient use of medical and nursing staff and associated facilities. Vaccine - A preparation containing killed or living whole microorganisms or a fraction of the organisms having antigenic properties. Vaccine is employed to induce, in the recipient, a specific active immunity to an infectious agent (usually an antibody response). Vector - An insect (e.g., tick) or any living carrier that transports an infe ctious agent from a source of infection to a susceptible host. Vehicle - An object or substance that can carry microorganism to a new host. Virus - Minute organisms not visible with ordinary light microscopy. They can reproduce only inside of a host cell. Virulence - The amount of power and the degree of pathogenicity possessed by organisms. Zoonosis - An infection or an infectious disease transmissible under natural conditions between animals and man. Iowa Dept. of Public Health Revi sed 04 /11 Glossary 11 "}
