Divergence exists among chronic care providers Shamans \u2014 the oldest known healers \u2014 were physicians/priests who catered to the needs of patients on every levelaccording to the available wisdom. Whether consciously or not, shamans knew that healing occurred on three levels: body,mind, and spirit. Few modern health care professionals would disagree that this is a basic need of all humans. Yet there is a great divergence ofopinion about how this should take place. Should today's physi-cian, nurse, or patient advocate also play the role of priest orpriestess, minister, or rabbi? Some say health care professionals should remain sympathetic, empathetic, but clinically detached from the spiritual needs of their patients, referring them to the profession-als for spiritual succor. Others insist theshaman's way must return, and to healthe patient, we must address all thepatient's needs \u2014 physical, emotional, and spiritual. The divergence may not be as wide as it might firstseem. Just as no responsible health care professional would suggesta primary care physician should treat a serious psychological disor-der or attempt complex surgeries, few, if any, would argue that seri-ous spiritual crises are best left in the hands of specialists.IN THIS ISSUE SEPTEMBER 2000 VOL. 1, NO. 3 (pages 25-36) GETALLTHE to heal?

A 1993 patient survey reported in the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation 1showed: \u007f 74% considered their religious and spiritual beliefs important. \u007f 54% desired pastoral counseling.\u007f 45% thought health care professionals paid too little attention to their spiritual and religiousconcerns. \u007f 73% said no one on staff ever inquired about these matters. \u007f 16% of physicians on staff, according to patients, ever inquired about spiritual or religiousmatters. Clinicians on the front lines are faced every day with ethical dilemmas that are demandingmore answers as American society turns moreand more to matters of religion and spirituality: Consider these situations:\u007f Should you agree to a patient's request for prayer just before surgery? \u007f Should you recommend, as recent literature suggests, that a patient might find peace, and per-haps healing, through faith? \u007f Do patients want you to discuss spiritual issues with them? \u007f Is it ever appropriate to encourage or dis- courage religious beliefs for the \"benefit\" of thepatient? There are no clear answers.Complementary Therapies in Chronic Care spoke to experts on both sides of the issue who offeredtheir viewpoints. (For additional viewpoints, see related stories, pp. 27-29.) Stay away from religion A cross-disciplinary team of physicians and clergy from a variety of faiths created a sensationin June when they wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine 2questioning \"the implications of making religious and spiritual matters part ofmedical care.\"While conceding that recent research suggests that religious faith and practice are positivelyassociated with health status, the authors wrote,\"We are concerned that broad generalizations arebeing made on the basis of limited, narrowlyfocused and methodically flawed studies of theplace of religion in medical practice.\" The letter was signed by Richard P . Sloan , PhD, associate professor of psychiatry at ColumbiaUniversity College of Physicians and Surgeons inNew York City, as well as seven members of theclergy affiliated with the ecumenical HealthCare Chaplaincy in New YorkCity. That organizationis the country's largestfreestanding chaplains'organization, which contracts pastoral services to hospitals, nursinghomes, and hospices. The clergy who signedthe letter represent six different faiths: RomanCatholic, Protestant, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist,and Greek Orthodox. \"It is never appropriate for a doctor to offer to pray with a patient,\" says Sloan. \"The patientought to be free to practice religion in whateverway he wants without interference.\" Furthermore, he says, the physician, nurse, or other health care professional should refer apatient to a chaplain when asked about spiritualmatters about which they have no expertise. \"At 26 COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CHRONIC CARE/ September 2000IIgnore biorhythms and suffer health risksIModerate drinking can protect diabeticsINatural hormone replacement: Sorting throughthe research on menopausalcomorbiditiesIComplementary approaches to Alzheimer'sdiseaseCOMING IN FUTURE MONTHSSpirituality Screening List Thisscreeningtoolcanbeusedduringinitialpatientcontact: Doyouconsideryourselfspiritualorreligious?

Source:NationalInstituteofHealthcareResearch,Rockville,MD. SPECIALREPORT: Tohealornottoheal? should be nice people. They shouldn't treat people like a piece of meat,but they also don't have to be counselors.\" Sloan's group made three basic points in the letter: 1.Empirical evidence for the idea that religious activities promote health is \"generally weak andunconvincing since it is based on studies with seri-ous methodological flaws, conflicting findings anddata that lack clarity and specificity.\" They con-cede that two recently reported \"well-conducted\"studies show that attendance at religious servicesis associated with reduced mortality. 2.Physicians should not recommend religious activity as a way of providing comfort. Sincephysicians have considerable influence withpatients, Sloan and colleagues argue, \"physiciansand patients, alike, are on dangerous ground ifthey believe that advice about religious mattershas the same medical support as a recommenda-tion about an antibiotic treatment.\" Such assump-tions have a ring of coercion and raise ethicalquestions about patient autonomy in religiousmatters, says Sloan. Furthermore, the signersargue, physicians are not properly trained toengage in in-depth conversations with patientsabout their spiritual concerns. 3.Finally, Sloan and his group note that only a minority of patients say they want a spiritual orreligious component as part of their medical care,and those results appear to be derived from studiesof patients in a family care setting. \"The degree towhich patients expressan interest in incorporat-ing religion and spiritu-ality into medical caredepends on the clinicalsetting, the interpersonaland communication skills of the physician, thenature of the specific physician-patient relation-ships, and the characteristics of the patient,\" Sloanwrote. Given the time constraints that are well known to health care providers, Sloan comments, \"Wequestion the assumption that this interest justifiesthe incorporation of religious matters into medi-cal practice. Patients often ask for things that areunrealistic or may not be in their best interests.\" One of the letter's authors, Larry VandeCreek , DMin, director of pastoral theHealthCare Chaplaincy in New YorkCity, says,\"From the chaplain's point of view, we are not interested at all in protecting our professionalturf. There's enough sin and sickness in theworld to keep everybody busy. \"Yet, VandeCreek contends, \"Religion is a very private issue, and patients and physicians alikehave enormous amounts of feelings.\" What should a surgeon do if a patient on the operating table requests a moment of prayer? \"I think there will always be patients who raise religious and spiritual issues with their physi-cians and there will be times, perhaps, like in asituation where the two have known each otherfor a long time or are members of the same reli-gious congregation, in which is it appropriate forthe physician to respond,\" he says.

The answer is mixed, depending on who you ask. The lack of physician attentiveness to matters of the spirit \"can constitute a form of negligence,\"says David Larson , MD, president of the National Institute of Healthcare Research in Rockville, MD. In an article published in the April 4, 2000, edi- tion of the Annals of Internal Medicine 1, Larson and his colleagues argue that spiritual care isvery appropriate for almost all patients sufferingfrom chronic disease, especially those with ter-minal illnesses. However, the stage must be setproperly, and the person who should deliver thattype of care should, in most cases, be a chaplain,he says. \"It simply doesn't work if a physician or other health care professional inquires about the patient'sreligion or spiritual beliefs on the fourth or fifth September 2000 / COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CHRONIC CARE27SPECIALREPORT: Tohealornottoheal? Body,mind,spiritappointment. The patient might, appropriately, consider it intrusive,\" says Larson. \"But if it is aroutine part of the case history, asked on the firstvisit, it is appropriate and usually well-accepted bypatients and viewed as an opportunity to expresstheir spirituality in a respectful and supportiveclinical environment.\" \"It would be disrespectful and not beneficial or supportive of autonomy to encourage patients toget religious or spiritual beliefs if they do nothave them,\" he cautions. Larson, whose organization encourages profes- sional collaboration to advance the understand-ing of spirituality and health and developseducational programs, says the chaplain plays akey role in the health care team, \"although veryfew doctors even know about their existence.\" Referral to a chaplain for the deep matters of spirit is not only helpful, it is essential, Larson says.He recalls when he wasin medical school andeven in the early yearsof internship and resi-dency, he was com-pletely unaware of the presence of chaplains. \"Ourconcern is that when doctors don't address some-thing, it doesn't happen.\" \"We don't want to make doctors into ministers or chaplains. We just want to let them know chap-lains are available when the questions get to bemore than they are prepared to deal with becauseof time constraints or lack of expertise,\" saysLarson. He notes that patients turn to their belief sys- tems, whatever those might be, in times of crisis,and they are basic concerns not necessarily tied toany particular religious tradition. \"Spirituality isthe functioning thing. Spirituality is what's impor-tant, whether it's through a church, mosque, tem-ple, or 12-step program.\" Physicians need to recognize those belief sys- tems and support them but should never prosely-tize, Larson stresses. He also warns of the importance of professional boundaries, even though those may be somewhatblurred in the mind of the patient. \"The pressureto blur the boundaries between the professionscomes from patients,\" he wrote. \"For example,about half the patients indicate a desire to havephysicians pray with them. If this finding is accu-rate, physicians might find a need to explain topatients why such activities usually fall bestunder the purview of competent pastoral care.\" He suggests that physicians and nurses tell theirpatients that chaplains have higher degrees of competency because of their specialized training. Larson agrees with Richard P . Sloan, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry at ColumbiaUniversity College of Physicians and Surgeons inNew York City, that the physician's influence,almost deified until very recently, might result inthe coercion of patients or the perception on thepatient's part that an even greater power thanwould occur without religious sanction. (See cover story.) Larson offers these examples: \"We would not condone a Jesuit medical geneticist who main-tains that it is appropriate and 'nondirective' towear his clerical collar while doing reproductivegenetic counseling in a non-Roman Catholichealth care setting. Nor would we want the clini-cian in a nonreligious health care institution toraise the question, 'Have you accepted the Lord?'Many patients would be confused and rightlyoffended,\" he says. Larson disagrees with the proposal for a return to the times of the healer-priests and argues thatin the past 30 years, the medical profession hasmade a concerted effort to demystify itself, with aspecial effort to change the image of the paternal-istic omnipotent physician. Learning more about spiritual concerns Yet at the same time, Larson advocates the education of health care professionals so they canbetter understand the spiritual concerns that arisein a clinical environment. For that reason, he says, more than 70 medical schools in the United States currently offer courseson religion, spirituality, and health. And what about the patient who requests bed- side prayer with his health care team? \"Physician-led prayer is acceptable only when pastoral care isnot readily available, when the patient is intent onprayer with the physician, and when the physi-cian can pray without having to feign faith andwithout manipulating the patient,\" says Larson. If those circumstances do not present them- selves, Larson suggests the health care profes-sionals \"simply listen respectfully while thepatient prays.\" Reference 1. Post S, Puchalski C, Larson D.

I 28 COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CHRONIC CARE/ September 2000SPECIALREPORT: Tohealornottoheal? Body,mind,spiritThe difference between religion and spirituality Address the patient on all levels \"Do I believe a belief system impacts a per-son's health? Absolutely!\" says Sister Rhea Emmer , a Roman Catholic nun who works with the Catholic Health Association of Wisconsinin Fond du Lac and teaches spirituality for healthcare professionals around the United States. There is a difference between religion and spirituality, says Emmer, and it is the spirit ofthe patient that must be addressed, regardlessof religious doctrine on either side of the medi-cal dividing line. \"Take nurses, for example: Part of the job is to help meet the spiritualneeds of the patient.They are not there topreach, proselytize, orevangelize. I make aclear distinction there,\" she says. Health care professionals who understand the difference between religion and spirituality havewhat Emmer calls \"a powerful ability to tap intothe inner resources of the patient.\" The primary role of the physician, she con- tends, should be to help patients tap into theirinner healer \u2014 not under the guise of religion,but in the sense of \"spirit to spirit. You cannotheal the body without spirit.\" What is the key to that connection? \"Active listening,\" says Emmer. Her philosophy is shared by family practi- tioner Maureen Murphy-Greenwood , MD, of the Wisconsin Dells Family Practice in Baraboo.\"Fully half the people I see every day will cry,\"says Murphy-Greenwood. \"They feel safeenough with me to open up.\" What does she do that's different? \"I listen. I try to bring an open book to every patient I see. Itry for my heart to touch their hearts. When theyfeel safe enough to talk about their soul's pain, Iknow we're where we need to be,\" she explains. Sometimes the discussion starts off simply, even casually. Murphy-Greenwood might gentlyinquire why she is seeing a patient for an upperrespiratory infection for the third time in as manymonths. \"She will usually tell me how stressed she is and how busy her life is,\" she says. \"And I'll help hersee the connection with what her body is telling her, and ask her what she can learn from it.\" There's no magic to this simple, but powerful message, Murphy-Greenwood says. She usuallytells patients with the recurring colds that shecan prescribe some pills, but the cold will likelyreturn, perhaps in a more resistant form. \"That's when [the patient will] say, 'I don't want to do this anymore,' and frequently begin to cry. Itell [that patient] we can do this together, and westart with baby steps, by taking time to meditate orpray, to exercise for energy and health, and to healrelationships.\" Emmer calls that an opportunity for the \"door to open wide and with a release of pain, whichleads to healing.\" Murphy-Greenwood agrees that patients put a great deal of stock in what a physician has tosay, but tempers it by admitting \"I am not here somuch to fix their problems as to help them [vocal-ize them].\" To health care professionals who don't think they have the personal tools to help their patientstap into the inner healer, Murphy-Greenwoodoffers some advice. \"Don't be afraid it will taketoo much time. These things just slip in duringthe ordinary conversation you have with patientsif they know you're really listening. Don't beafraid a patient will say something you don'thave an answer for. Just listen and echo backwhat you hear.\" Finally, she suggests health care professionals who aren't in touch with their own spiritualitymight be more fearful of approaching those issueswith patients. \"Do your own work, look at yourown issues, and become much more of a healer.\" Emmer adds, \"Doctors and health care profes- sionals are not just glorified mechanics of thebody. It is time to re-establish the bridge betweenmedicine and spirit. We have to go back to beingshamans.\" I September 2000 / COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CHRONIC CARE29SPECIALREPORT: Tohealornottoheal?

ICancer patients may try alternative remedies Help your patients by being fully informed Cancer is perhaps one of the most frighteningand disempowering diseases known to humankind. A diagnosis of cancer seems like adeath sentence to most patients, no matter howmuch time health care professionals spend talk-ing about options and about hope. Patients frequently feel helpless and angry until they enter the stage of fighting back, usually char-acterized by a regimen of voracious reading tolearn more about their disease. And it isn't longafter that the patient discovers the jungle of infor-mation about alternative therapies for cancer. What your patient does with that information, however, is a product of the trust you've built.Whether he discusses alternative therapies withyou or whether he goes off on his own and triesseveral approaches about which you may neverknow, studies show up to 60% of all cancer patientswill avail themselves of at least one form of alterna-tive therapy during the course of their disease. 1 Making your patient a partner And, experts say, your patients can become partners in the care by helping with the researchnecessary to make an informed decision aboutthe potential usefulness of specific alternativetherapies. \"A number of alternative agents seem to be extremely helpful,\" says James Gordon , MD, founder and director of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine in Washington, DC. \"The consid-eration of a wide range of alternative therapiesshould be part of a comprehensive cancer careprogram for everyone.\" Alternative therapies can have many effects among them. They can unleash the possibilitiesfor self-healing in patients with cancer, saysGordon, who also serves as chairman of theWhite House Commission on Complementaryand Alternative Medicine Policy and is a clinicalprofessor of psychiatry and family medicine atGeorgetown University in Washington, DC. \"[Those therapies] nourish the body's reparative processes, increase its ability to destroy cancer cells,and decrease the tumor burdens. They enhance thequality of life and help people with cancer see theirillness as more of a challenge and less of a misfor- tune,\" he says. Gordon is author of the recentlyreleased Comprehensive Cancer Care: Integrating Alternative, Complementary and Conventional Thera-pies, compiled from information presented at the annual conference of the same name as the book. Gordon recommends an integrated approach to cancer care that is tailored to each patient'sneeds. \"Doctors and members of the health care team should be proactive in helping people put togethertheir care program, particularly in helping patientscope with the psychological impact of a diagnosisof cancer,\" he says. It is inherent on the physician and his team to be up to date and well-informed about comple-mentary therapies, ranging from herbs and nat-ural supplements to chemical compounds totraditional Chinese medicine, meditation, yoga,tai chi, acupuncture, and more. \"Patients are becoming very disturbed by oncologists who make pronouncements aboutwhat works or not based on no knowledge atall,\" says Gordon. He recommends the following therapies for cancer patients, based on his own research: \u007f Green tea with its polyphenols act as a pow- erful antioxidant, \"as close to a perfect phytonu-trient as we've seen. It should be part of a cancertreatment plan.\" \u007f Shark cartilage inhibits the signals for capil- lary growth to the tumor. \"Large doses appear tobe effective for some cancer patients in control-ling cancer growth and even causing regressionof tumors.\" \u007f Maitake mushroom extract has the \"ability to kill tumors by activating the immune system,\"particularly for breast, lung, liver, prostate, andbrain cancers, especially in conjunction withchemotherapy. \u007f Coenzyme Q 10can reduce chemotherapy- induced heart damage and has an antioxidantagent that may affect tumor growth. \"For anyonewith breast cancer, CoQ 10is essential,\" says Gordon. Clearly, some alternative therapies have better evidence behind them than others, so that sim-ply gives health care professionals a strongerincentive to communicate effectively and clearlywith their patients about their use, says Jeffrey White , MD. White is the director of the National Cancer Institute's Office of Complementary andAlternative Medicine in Bethesda, MD. \"Work with your patients,\" says White. \"Don't 30 COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CHRONIC CARE/ September 2000create a situation in which patients are afraid to tell their doctors what they are taking. Have anopen dialogue with them about their expectationsand help them realistically understand what'sgoing on and what their options are.\" He says some therapies are helpful and effec- tive; his particular favorites are garlic and sawpalmetto for prostate cancer patients and grape-seed extract and milk thistle for a wide range ofother cancers. White also is willing to concedethat the placebo effect may be responsible forsome of the results that have been published forthese and other remedies. \"It doesn't matter. Wedon't want to offhandedly dismiss these sorts ofthings.\" The National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and AlternativeMedicine (NCCAM), also in Bethesda, MD, isworking to \"get a handle on the complicatedquestions associated with alternative cancer ther- apies,\" says Mary Ann Richardson , DrPH, pro- gram officer for NCCAM. Richardson encourages physicians and clini- cians to \"open the dialogue,\" to share informa-tion and case studies of these ancient remediesthat are being rediscovered in the context of mod-ern medicine.\" \"We need to collect reliable information and then undertake a systematic review of the evi-dence,\" she says. \"It's a new day; the world ofmedicine is just waking up to the possibilities ofcomplementary medicine.\" Reference 1.

I September 2000 / COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CHRONIC CARE31Know the science behind the alternative remedy According to the National Cancer Institute(NCI) in Bethesda, MD, and the University of Texas at Houston Center for Alternative Medi-cine Research in Cancer, these are some of themost commonly used alternative remedies forcancer and the science behind them: MISTLETOE A parasitic plant, mistletoe holds interest as a possible anticancer agent because extractsderived from it have been shown to kill cancercells in vitro and to stimulate immune systemcells both in vitro and in vivo. Several compo-nents of mistletoe \u2014 alkaloids, viscotoxins, andlectins \u2014 may be responsible for those effects. In modern studies, mistletoe extracts have been administered by intramuscular injection, subcuta-neous injection (sometimes in the vicinity of atumor), or intravenous infusion. Mistletoe hasbeen used for centuries to treat a number of ail-ments in humans, but scientific data from con-trolled or uncontrolled studies of cancer arelimited and often of poor quality. Several studies involving patients with breast cancer have demonstrated that extracts of Viscum album L, or the lectin ML-I purified from them, can stimulate increases in a variety of white bloodcell types and may be able to induce cells to repairdamaged DNA.SHARK AND BOVINE CARTILAGE Cartilage products are widely used in the United States for the treatment of medical condi-tions such as cancer, arthritis, and psoriasis. It isestimated that more than 50,000 Americans usedshark cartilage in 1992, and with media attentionincreasing, this number is likely to grow substan-tially. In 1995, more than 40 brand names of sharkcartilage products were being sold in the UnitedStates. Most purchases are made over thecounter. Use of the products is not limited tohumans. Products containing shark and bovinecartilage for both human and veterinary use havebeen marketed and sold throughout the world. The major components of shark cartilage are proteins (about 40%), glycosaminoglycans (about5% to 20%), and calcium salts. Chondroitin sul-fate, one of the most plentiful glycosaminogly-cans found in cartilage, is under investigation todetermine if it is one of the active ingredients.Cartilage reportedly has been sold in many formsand is given in many ways. It can be taken orallyas a pill, powder, or liquid extract; given as a top-ical agent, an enema, or infusion;or administered subcutaneous, intraperi-toneal, or intramuscular injection. During the mid-'70s, several published studies reported that the cartilage, serum, and liver ofsharks may have antineoplastic (anti-cancer) prop-erties against lung cancer and leukemia in a marinemodel. Research continued during the '80s. However, many results from early studies gen- erated additional questions about the possiblemechanism(s) of action of these compounds andprovided few definitive answers. The use of shark cartilage as a cancer treatment has drawnattention because of the popular belief that theincidence of cancer in cartilaginous fish (sharks,skates, and rays) is very rare or nonexistent.Literature on cancer in fish, however, shows thismay not be true. Very little scientifically based data have been published on this subject. Two clinical series, oneusing shark cartilage with 32 breast and prostatecancer patients and another using bovine carti-lage with 35 renal cell carcinoma patients, and aphase II trial of oral shark cartilage powder with60 advanced cancer patients were presented asabstracts at national oncology meetings. Onlytwo bovine cartilage case series and one phaseI/II shark cartilage case series have been pre-sented. The majority of studies used bovine orshark cartilage as a treatment for advanced can-cer patients, but the response rate to cartilagetherapy for those patients has not been impres-sive. Randomized clinical trials to test whethercartilage may be effective for patients with lim-ited disease have not been conducted. COENZYME Q 10 Coenzyme known as synthesized naturally in thehuman body. Coenzyme Q 10is used by cells in a process known variously as aerobic respiration,aerobic metabolism, oxidative metabolism, or cellrespiration. CoQ 10also is used by the body as an endogenous antioxidant. In part because of itsimmunostimulatory potential, CoQ 10has been used as an adjuvant therapy in patients with vari-ous types of cancer. While CoQ 10may show indirect anti-cancer activity through its effect(s) on the immune system,there is evidence to suggest that analogs of thiscompound are able to suppress cancer growthdirectly. Analogs of CoQ 10have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro andthe growth of cancer cells transplanted into ratsand mice. In view of those findings, it has beenproposed that analogs of CoQ 10may function as antimetabolites to disrupt normal biochemical reac-tions that are required for cell growth and/or sur-vival and, thus, that they may be useful for shortperiods of time as chemotherapeutic agents. Several companies distribute CoQ 10as a dietary supplement. In humans, it is usually taken orallyas a pill (tablet or capsule). Dosages are usually inthe range of 90 mg to 390 mg per day.In view of the promising results from animal studies, CoQ 10was tested as a protective agent against the cardiac toxicity observed in cancerpatients treated with the anthracycline drug dox-orubicin. It has been postulated that doxorubicininterferes with generating biochemicalreactions involving CoQ 10in heart muscle mito- chondria and that this interference can be over-come by CoQ 10supplementation. Studies with adults and children have confirmed the decreasein cardiac toxicity observed in animal studies. Anecdotal reports of CoQ 10lengthening the survival of patients with pancreatic, lung, rectal,laryngeal, colon, and prostate cancers also existin the peer-reviewed, scientific literature. Thepatients described in these reports also receivedtherapies other than CoQ 10, including chemother- apy, radiation therapy, and surgery. ESSIAC TEA Essiac is not one herb, but actually a combina- tion of several herbs. It originally contained bur-dock root, the inner bark of slippery elm, sheepsorrel, and Turkish rhubarb. More recent combi-nations have added watercress, blessed thistle,red clover, and kelp (to aid with effectivenessand improve taste). The herbs are combined to form a tea, which is then administered orally in an effort to promotehealth, strengthen the immune system, improveappetite, relieve pain, improve overall quality oflife, and reduce the size of tumors. None of these herbs are reputed to be \"anti- cancer\" rather, the body cleansing and support-ing actions are emphasized. If any or all of theseeffects could be achieved, it would be of obviousbenefit to someone dealing with cancer and anadded benefit from synergistic effects. Essiac is widely used among cancer patients.No completed formal studies have been docu- mented in the literature, and no prospective clini-cal trials have been conducted. Several attemptshave been made to document the effectiveness ofEssiac by several Canadian groups, but nothingconclusive resulted from these attempts. Basedon testimonials provided to the Canadian RoyalCancer Commission in 1938, of eight patientswith confirmed diagnoses of cancer, positive out-comes in two of four patients could be attributedto Essiac. PSK In Asian cultures, mushrooms are traditionally combined with herbal mixtures to treat cancer. 32 COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CHRONIC CARE/ September 2000Reports in 1965 documented health benefits for stomach cancer with Saru-no-koshikake tea con-taining coriolus versicolor mushroom. Research has found that this mushroom has antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-tumor proper-ties. The activity is attributed to a protein-boundpolysaccharide that can be extracted from its cul-tured mycelium, thread-like extensions. Thispolysaccharide K (PSK) also is known as Krestin. Animal studies have demonstrated that PSK prevents the induction of tumors by chemicals,radiation, or other causes. PSK is considereda promising candidate for chemopreventionbecause of the multiple effects on the malignantprocess, limited side effects, and safety of dailyoral doses for extended periods of time. Research shows that healthy people given a 1,000 mg dose experienced significant cellularimmune response within 12 hours. After cancersurgery, individuals who were not using conven-tional therapy had significant immune benefitwith 3,000 mg daily and a subsequent reduceddosage of 1,000 mg daily. When chemotherapyor radiation is used after surgery, significantimprovements in immunity were achieved with3,000 mg daily dose. For inoperable patients, adose of up to 9,000 mg a day was used with noside effects or toxicity.(Editor's note: PSK is not widely available in the United States, but it is used extensively in Japan.) GREEN TEA Green tea, like black tea, is made from the leaves of the Camellia Sinensis plant, but differs from black tea in its preparation. The leaves usedfor green tea are steamed or pan-dried withoutfermentation, so the active substances within theleaves can retain their qualities. The tea is con-sumed by billions of people, not only as a satisfy-ing beverage but to promote health. Green teareportedly lowers total cholesterol levels andimproves the cholesterol profile, reduces plateletstickiness, lowers blood pressure, and enhancesthe immune system. It also may decrease the risk of certain cancers, especially cancers of the upper digestive system,and may be beneficial as a weight-loss aid. Studiesin animals have reported that green tea polyphe-nols reduce the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Green tea contains polyphenols, which include flavanols, flavandiols, flavonoids, and phenolicacids; those compounds may account for up to30% of dry weight. Constituents of green tea canbe fractionated as GTP (green tea polyphenoliccompounds) and WEGT blocking the endogenous formation of N-nitrosocompounds suppressing the activation of carcino-gens and trapping of genotoxic agents. Many labo-ratory studies have also demonstrated inhibitoryeffects of tea polyphenols against tumor formationand growth. The effect of tea consumption on cancer is likely to depend on the causative factors of thespecific cancer. Therefore, a protective effectobserved on a certain cancer with a specificpatient group may not be generalizable. HYDRAZINE SULFATE This product is a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor that has been investigated for more than30 years as a treatment for cancer and as a ther-apy to decrease cancer-related anorexia and mus-cle wasting. It has been studied as a first-linechemotherapeutic agent, in combination withestablished chemotherapy regimens, and as anadjuvant therapy to decrease symptoms associ-ated with cancer, such as weight loss, fatigue, anddecreased appetite. September 2000 / COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN created in a labo- ratory setting, but does occur naturally in tobaccoplants, tobacco smoke, and in some mushrooms. Most of the randomized clinical trials and some clinical series conclude that hydrazinesulfate provides little or no benefit to cancerpatients when it is taken alone or in combina-tion with other cancer treatment modalities toimprove quality of life and weight gain. Threeseparate phase III randomized, placebo-con-trolled clinical trials sponsored by NCI alsocame to this conclusion. I Words can hurt you and your patients \"Sticks and stones can break my bones, butnames will never hurt me,\" according to a children's taunt that researchers have now turnedon its head. Negative beliefs or stereotypes about aging can cause cardiovascular stress in elderly Americanswho encounter such attitudes in their daily lives,wrote a Yale team in an article published in theJuly Journal of Gerontology . 1 Conversely, positive images reduce cardiovas- cular stress in the elderly, reducing their risk ofdeveloping heart disease, congestive heart fail-ure, and a variety of cardiovascular-related dis-eases, according to findings from a team headedbyBecca Levy , PhD, associate professor of psy- chology at Yale University in New Haven, CT. Levy and her colleagues recruited 54 people between the ages of 62 and 82 and showed thema math problem, which masked a subliminalsequence of stereotypical words flashed on a com-puter screen. Participants were exposed to negativestereotypes that included words such as \"senile,\"\"dying,\" and \"decrepit.\" (See box, above right.) The measures of cardiovascular stress showed an 8-point increase in systolic blood pressure, a1-point increase in diastolic blood pressure plusincreased heart and skin conductance rates in thecourse of a one-minute challenge. Another group, subjected to a similar math challenge, was given positive subliminalprompts such as \"wise,\" \"sage,\" and \"creative\"with dramatically different results. Their sys-tolic and diastolic blood pressures dropped 5points, while heart rate increased slightly andskin conductance was unchanged. Interestingly, those subjected to the positive aging stereotypes demonstrated significantlyhigher self-confidence and higher mathematicalperformance than those exposed to the negativestereotypes. \"Negative stereotypes are found inmany aspects of our culture,\" Levy says, \"fromcasual conversations to television advertisementsthat often present the elderly either as close tochildhood or close to death.\" In China, a country with more positive aging stereotypes than the United States, Levy found ina past study that older people performed better oncertain memory tasks than their American peers. \"The study suggests that negative stereotypes of aging may contribute to health problems in theelderly without their awareness,\" Levy says.\"This, in turn, could lead to older individualsmistakenly attributing declines in their health tothe inevitability of aging, which might then rein-force the negative stereotypes.\" Based on her findings, Levy says, future treat- ment aimed at reducing stress in the elderlyshould include the reduction of negative agingstereotypes and the promotion of positive ones. Jared Jobe , PhD, an experimental psychologist and chief of adult psychological development atthe National Institute on Aging in Bethesda, MD,would take Levy's suggestion a little further.\"This is an important finding with strong implica-tions in clinical practice. It shows that the powerof words is very physiological. And it gives us alla message to use positive words when we addressour patients.\" 34 COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CHRONIC CARE/ September 2000Words that Generate Negative Stereotypes About Aging Alzheimer's confused decline decrepit dementia dependentdiseases dying forgetsincompetent misplaces senile Words that Generate Positive Stereotypes About Aging accomplished advice alert astute creative enlightenedguidance improving insightfullearned sage wise Source:LevyB,HausdorffJ,HenckeR.Reducingcardiovas- cularstresswithpositiveself-stereotypesofaging.

I Supplement quality, purity reports available on-line Independent tests show shortfalls, contaminants What once seemed a pipe dream has becomereality: independent testing of vitamin and herb supplements to give consumers and healthcare professionals confidence that the over-the-counter products they use are safe. Consumerlab.com offers \"an excellent\" review of a variety of products by brand name that willsome day be considered the equivalent of the Good Housekeeping Seal of approval for supplements, says Ralph Hall , MD, emeritus professor of medi- cine at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. He advocates tighter government regulation of supplements sold over the counter, and says Con-sumerlab.com is a potent resource for patients andhealth care professionals alike. (See Complemen- tary Therapies in Chronic Care , August 2000, p. 17.) Consumerlab.com president and founder Tod Cooperman , MD, calls his White Plains, NY- based company \"an information company.\" Thesite is celebrating its first year of being on-line. \"We started this venture for all the reasons you might guess. It's a terrible problem for consumersto sort through a huge number of products interms of quality and what's been shown to workclinically,\" says Cooperman. Supplements are sent out to independent labs for testing for the presence of active ingredients,proper ingredients as labeled, and contaminants.About 25% of the products considered by Con-sumerlab.com are tested at the manufacturer'srequest, he says. Testing is blinded, however, sincelaboratories are not informed of the brand namesof the products they test. Results of those permitted to carry the now- coveted Consumerlab flask emblem are postedon the Web site. Those that failed are not named,but anyone who wishes to pay from $750 to $900per report can get all the data on all productstested. Most of the customers for the negativereports are supplement manufacturers, health food stores, and other retailers, says Cooperman. Consumerlab says a supplement's absence from the approved list does not mean it failed thetesting, since there are hundreds, perhaps thou-sands, of brand names available in some cate-gories and only a handful are tested. But Hall adds, \"If it's on the approved list, you know it's good.\" Although Consumerlab.com hasreported on only seven categories of supple-ments, the results have been impressive, he says: \u007fAsian and American ginseng. Of 22 brands tested, only nine passed review.

Two products contained lead above theacceptable level, and seven contained less thanthe stated concentration of the active ingredients,ginsenosides. Ginseng is generally used forincreasing energy levels and vitality. \u007fGinkgo biloba. Of 30 brands tested, 25% of those claiming they contained standardizedextracts did not contain the stated concentrationof ginkgo biloba extract, and among those, all hadless than adequate levels of one or more terpenelactones and three also lacked adequate levels offlavone glycosides. biloba often is used to help increase cogni-tive function and has been used for the treatmentof depression and asthma. \u007fGlucosamine and condroitin. One-half of the combined 25 products did not pass testing.Consumerlab speculates this is because of thehigh cost of condroitin. Glucosamine is used toslow the progression of osteoarthritis. \u007fSAMe. Of 13 brands of S-adenosyl-methion- ine (SAMe) tested, only seven were found to con-tain the labeled amounts. For one product, theamount of SAMe was undetectable. In additionto low levels of SAMe found in many products,labeling information on several products couldlead consumers to expect twice the amount ofSAMe in the product as was actually provided.SAMe is most often used in treating depressionand osteoarthritis. \u007fVitamin C. Ascorbic acid, required by the Food and Drug Administration to contain at least100% of the stated amount, however, it is not rou-tinely tested. Consumerlab tested 26 brands ofvitamin C, including five designed for children.Four did not pass testing. One did not break downproperly to deliver the vitamin for absorption anduse by the body. Three others had insufficient vita-min C levels in the pills. Vitamin C is a vital nutri-ent found in many foods. It is an antioxidant thatmay help boost immune function, protect andother chronic diseases. \u007fSaw palmetto. Twenty-one brands were tested, and four were found to contain less thanthe minimum amounts of specific fatty acidsand/or sterols commonly found in saw palmettoproducts commonly used in clinical trials. Sawpalmetto, widely used for treating symptoms ofprostate enlargement, is standardized to 85%fatty acids and sterols. \u007fCreatine. Eleven of 13 brands tested passed. One of the two products that failed contained lessthan the stated levels of creatine and the other wascontaminated with dicynadiamide. Creatine com-monly is used to improve athletic performance. Cooperman says his company intends to post new listings approximately every four to six weeks.Consumerlab.com will begin testing weight controlsupplements, tapping into a huge and diverse mar-ket which many believe is fraught with misrepre-sentation, sometime in 2001, he notes.
