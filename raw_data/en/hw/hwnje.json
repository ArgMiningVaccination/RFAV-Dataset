[Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD, and Timothy N. Gorski, MD, FACOG]The public's increased use of complementary and alternative medicine has added urgency to the need to examine the safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices and products and to discover the basic mechanisms underlying them. [This sidesteps the fact that the underlying basis of many \"CAM\" methods is supernatural and delusional.] Basic, clinical, and health services research in CAM are all essential to the inclusion of CAM in the health care system. [It is correct, of course, that no practice should be permissible without evidence that it works or at least makes sense. However, the Commission deliberately fails to mention that research might also justify elimination of many popular methods.] Public and private funding for this research should be increased and the paucity of private investment in research on herbal and other CAM products popular with the public should be addressed. [Popularity should not be the primary factor in setting research priorities.] Rigorous research provides the information needed to increase the public's knowledge about CAM and to educate and train CAM and conventional health care professionals. It also provides a basis for regulating the quality and use of CAM products and devices as well as improving access to safe and effective CAM practices and products and health insurance coverage for them. [Again the Commission deliberately avoids mentioning that research might provide a basis for eliminating unsafe and ineffective nethods and that vigorous action should be taken to ban methods that are already known to be unsafe or ineffective.] In addition to questions of safety and efficacy, further studies should be undertaken to determine why people use CAM, how lifestyle and self-care affect health and disease, and how practitioner-patient interactions affect treatment outcomes. [Most of this is already known, but \"CAM\" advocates love these types of studies because they make headlines that encourage people to jump on the \"CAM\" bandwagon.\"] Research is also needed to pursue answers to questions posed by CAM that lie outside the conventional medical paradigm. [This refers to practices that are based on superstition and delusion. Rational people already know that they are senseless. It would be a waste of time and money to study these unless negative results would lead to banning them.] Establishing a strong scientific base in CAM is necessary for acceptance and inclusion of safe and effective CAM therapies in health care. [This falsely assumes that research would support a vast number of \"CAM\" practices and products.] In conventional medical practice, professional judgments are based on practitioners' training and experience and an accepted and expanding body of knowledge based on research findings published in peer-reviewed journals. Professional judgments in the practice of CAM are often not viewed in a similar light because of the lack of a sufficient body of evidence-based knowledge on which to form them. [That's only part of the story. Many \"CAM\" advocates have fixed beliefs that would not be influenced by contradictory information.] As the body of research literature in CAM expands, the professional judgments of trained and experienced CAM practitioners will be accepted more readily. [\"More readily\" implies that many \"CAM\" methods are being unfairly rejected because of \"bias\" rather than lack of evidence.] An important milestone toward the goal of increasing the body of evidence-based knowledge in CAM occurred in 1992 with the establishment of the Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The mandate of this office was to facilitate and coordinate CAM research and related projects with other NIH institutes, centers and offices, and to provide information to the public. In 1998, research in CAM took another major step forward when the Office of Alternative Medicine became, through congressional mandate, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). The expanded resources available to NCCAM enhanced its ability both to continue and build upon the work of the earlier office to provide the public with evidence on the safety and efficacy of CAM practices and products. [NCCAM has a few potentially useful studies under way. So far, however, it and its predecessors have not demonstrated that any \"CAM\" method works or doesn't work and should be embraced or abandoned.] Research Support and Scope Current CAM Research Activities The Commission commends NCCAM for its leadership and contributions to CAM research, methodology, training, and infrastructure development and supports increasing the center's crucial activities in these areas, including its database development and information dissemination responsibilities. NCCAM collaborates with NIH components, as well as other government agencies and non-government organizations. It initiates and funds research projects and establishes research centers at conventional medical institutions and CAM institutions. It also supports the training of CAM researchers and the research infrastructure at conventional and CAM institutions, supports educational activities, and offers opportunities for collaborations between CAM practitioners and researchers and mainstream investigators. The Commission commends current collaborations and encourages further collaboration between NCCAM and other Federal agencies, such as the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Health Research and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. The NIH Office of Dietary Supplements is also carrying out important work. The mandate of this office includes exploring the role of dietary supplements in the improvement of health care, promoting scientific study, and supporting conferences, workshops, and symposia, which it does in conjunction with NCCAM, other NIH institutes, centers, and offices, other government agencies, professional organizations, and public groups. The Commission also recognizes the support for CAM research by the other NIH components, encourages them to increase their valuable support, and notes especially the work of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the National Library of Medicine. In response to the public's use of CAM practices and products, overall NIH funding for research on CAM increased from $116.0 million in FY 1999 to an estimated $247.6 million in FY 2002. During the same period, funding by NCCAM increased from $48.9 million to an estimated $104.6 million. [The primary reason for NCCAM's funding increase is the support of Senator Tom Harkin, who has done more to promote quackery than any other Congressman in U.S. history.] Despite this increase, an analysis of NCCAM's extramural research trends between FY 1999 and FY 2003 indicates a growing number of applications and a decreasing number of new awards, resulting in a declining success rate, which is the percentage of research project grant applications that receive funding. Research project grants are awarded for an average of four years during which time they are considered non-competing grants. As an increasing number of quality CAM research applications are submitted and awarded, the number of non-competing grants to which funds are committed (the commitment base) grows. The increasing commitment base, which also may include some larger and longer-term clinical studies is a likely cause of the estimated decline in new awards. Therefore, in order to build the much needed evidence base for CAM, adequate funding is essential to support NCCAM's commitment base, grant renewals, and as many meritorious new awards as possible. Historically, as new NIH grant-awarding organizations move through budget allocation cycles and develop longer grant histories, they gradually improve the balance between non-competing and competing grants, but they are always aware of the need for adequate funding to support both. The Commission believes that NCCAM's budget increases should be sufficient to support growing numbers of awards to meet research needs and opportunities in crucial areas to ensure public health and safety. To help identify research needs and promising research opportunities, NCCAM, assisted by the Institute of Medicine, should develop guidelines for establishing research priorities in CAM. [Research priorities should be based on the likelihood of producing useful results and not on whether or not something is designated as \"CAM.\"] Because of the diversity of CAM systems and practices and the wide range and fluidity of opinions on the definition of what constitutes complementary and alternative medicine, it is important also to address the issue of definition because the current ambiguity makes it difficult to set priorities for guiding the use of resources. [Since \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" are marketing terms intended to cause confusion, it is not possible to meaningfully define them.] Other Federal agencies with research or health care responsibilities need to take a more active role in developing programs to evaluate biomedical and health services aspects of CAM to ensure that CAM use by the public is safe and effective. Funding for these programs should be sufficient to accomplish this goal. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality together with NCCAM should develop ways to expand health services research in CAM and explore methodologies for conducting health services research in this area. Federal agencies should assess the scientific, clinical practice, and public needs regarding CAM that are relative to their missions, examine their portfolios, and develop funding strategies to address these needs. They should ensure that applicants are aware of any technical assistance available to them. Agencies might consider such activities as funding initiatives (requests for applications and proposals), establishing CAM-focused offices or centers, designating CAM-focused staff positions, and creating CAM advisory committees or ensuring the representation of qualified CAM professionals on such committees. [There seems to be no limit to the ways the Commission wants to promote \"CAM\" methods. Why not suggest passing a law to abolish logical thinking and science-based practices so \"CAM\" advocates will have fewer obstacles?] Public and Private Research Funding for CAM Products That May Not Be Patentable The funding of research on frequently used or promising dietary supplements and other natural products that may not be patentable is a public health need of paramount importance. This research is needed to determine whether the products are safe to use alone and with other CAM and non-CAM products, and whether they are effective. Research is also needed on the development of analytical methods for producing better quality products, as well as on CAM therapeutic devices that may not be patentable. This research requires substantial Federal support now and in the immediate future. Along with the need for public funding is the need for incentives to stimulate more private sector support in this area. Congress and the Executive Branch might consider incentives such as low interest loans, tax incentives, market exclusivity, and the resolution of intellectual property issues. Workshops supported by the public and private sectors should be convened to discuss the research that is needed, including discussions on funding issues and sources, and the research needed by regulatory agencies for the review and approval processes. Private companies should recognize how important clinical research, product quality and dependability, and accurate information are to the public's perception of CAM products. [It would be more important to strengthen the ability of government agencies to ban products and services that are already known to be unsafe, irrational, or ineffective.] Federal agencies need to develop outreach programs to inform manufacturers of CAM products and devices about the Federal research support available to private industry, such as the Small Business Innovative Research Grant (R43/44), the Small Business Technology Transfer Research Grant (R41/42), 1 and the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement [2]. The manufacturers of CAM products and devices should become acquainted with potential sources of funding and with the requirements they must meet to receive such funds. Federal agency staff members are available to assist applicants with protocol development and to help them understand the grant process. CAM's Emphasis on Health and the Whole Person Public interest in CAM has renewed awareness of and respect for the importance of the whole person in maintaining health and treating disease. [No study has shown that \"CAM\" practitioners actually do this.] Members of the public have expressed appreciation for the attention many CAM practitioners and disciplines give to wellness and health promotion, self-care, lifestyle, quality of life, behavior, and the combined role of mind, body, and spirituality in health, disease, and healing. People also appreciate the importance many CAM practitioners and disciplines place on the interactions between patient and practitioner and on individualizing treatments. CAM's emphasis on the individual's biochemical uniqueness [3] and the value of tailoring treatments to the biological, psychological, sociological and spiritual aspects of the person, reinforces the need to increase studies on individualized CAM treatments and the variations in patients' responses to conventional medical treatments. [Although many \"CAM\" practitioners claim to do this, much of what they do has no rational basis.] Research in these areas, which converges with conventional behavioral and psychosocial research, may contribute in important ways to health care, particularly in rehabilitation and the management of chronic diseases and disorders, and merits increased public and private investment. Treatments, such as biofeedback, meditation, guided imagery, art therapy and music therapy, which appear to be effective but may not be profitable to private investors, should also receive Federal support. [These methods may help people relaxed and helps take their mind of their symptoms. They do not deserve high research priority.] In addition, research on 1) the synergistic activities of complex compounds and mixtures frequently found in CAM products; 2) clinical interventions consisting of multiple, combined treatments; 3) how patient-practitioner interactions affect treatment outcomes; and 4) the individualization of treatments should be supported by the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic medicine are examples of systems of practice that target specific conditions and might provide interesting and worthwhile research avenues to follow in studying some of these areas. [These Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda involve nonsensical diagnostic methods and treatment of nonexistent \"energy imbalances.\" These warrant no further study. Some of the herbal concoctions they utilize might be worth investigating to see whether they contain any useful ingredients.] Pluralism in Research Approaches and Quality in Research Methodology Various research approaches, if pertinent to the CAM question being asked, contribute to developing evidence of safety and clinical efficacy, understanding basic mechanisms of action underlying practices and products, and evaluating general effectiveness in the health-care system. Among these approaches are basic research, randomized controlled clinical trials, non-randomized studies, empirical observation, case studies, evaluations of practice-based data, and practice-based outcomes research. Also included are epidemiological and surveillance studies, behavioral and quality-of-life studies, qualitative research, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit studies, population and utilization studies, studies on health care delivery, and health care demonstration projects on various aspects of CAM use and services. To be methodologically sound, CAM studies must have a clear question (hypothesis), a sound study design, a qualified and appropriately constituted research team, objective and verifiable data, carefully defined outcome measures, and balanced conclusions that meet acceptable standards of evidence. The randomized controlled clinical trial is recognized as the gold standard for examining many clinical questions. Because of the complexity and uniqueness of illness and CAM approaches to illness, it may be necessary to adapt clinical trial methodology, in a flexible, step-wise fashion, to the unique characteristics of CAM questions and systems of care, while complying with protections for human subjects and institutional review board (IRB) guidelines. Questions of standardization and non-standardization, individualization and generalization, blinding, randomization, the placebo effect, compound mixtures, and many other research methodology challenges need to be resolved within the context of the study question and design and the overall research strategy. [This bypasses the question of the extent to which \"CAM\" methods are worth sturying. Those that have an irrational basis are not.] It is important to note that investigators in conventional clinical research have also adapted methodology and design to meet the needs of a study. Scientists have always followed their quests for knowledge by developing new ways to answer difficult questions, and pluralism in research design will allow scientists to develop innovative methods to examine complex CAM questions [4]. Funding mechanisms that have promoted interdisciplinary exchange of ideas in addressing difficult research questions in conventional research may offer settings in which creative ways of approaching difficult CAM research questions can be developed. Examples of such mechanisms include Specialized Center Awards (P50), Exploratory Grants (P20), and Center Core Grants (P30). Other awards of interest are the Exploratory/Developmental Grants (R21), which encourage the development of new research activities in categorical program areas, and the James A. Shannon Director's Award (R55), which is a limited grant mechanism for developing, testing, and defining research techniques and the feasibility of innovative, creative, research approaches [5]. In addition, multidisciplinary conferences, workshops, and expert panels, such as the CAM cancer symptom management research panel convened in November 2001, provide effective forums for exploring ways to address CAM research-related issues and challenges. The results of meetings such as these are often published in peer-reviewed journals and can stimulate new research and public and private investment. [The standards for studying \"CAM\" methods should be the same as those for studying any other method.] Exploring Whole Systems Concepts and Expanding Areas of Scientific Inquiry In addition to the primary task of identifying practices and products that could become complementary to conventional care or possibly alternative treatments, CAM research may go beyond isolated treatments and contribute innovative ideas to emerging areas of science that might help expand our understanding of health, disease, and healing. [This is wishful thinking. It hasn't happened yet, and there is no logical reason to think it will.] The CAM research spectrum is broad. It includes areas that in some cases may be almost indistinguishable from conventional medicine except for pharmacological agents, techniques, or application, such as exercise/diet/lifestyle therapies, herbal/nutritional supplements, behavioral/mind-body methods, pain management, the effects of culture on health and treatment, and the ability of the body to heal. [The meaning of this sentence is unclear.] The spectrum also includes areas that may receive less attention but are, or are becoming, areas of interest to conventional science, such as increasing our understanding of complete biological systems and how they interact, the placebo effect, spirituality, consciousness, and electromagnetic fields. Finally, the spectrum includes areas that challenge current biological and scientific concepts and assumptions, such as homeopathy, bioenergy (vital force; e.g., Qi, prana), bioelectromagnetic therapy, and therapeutic prayer. [They postulate supernatural \"healing forces\" that cannot be measured and, for practical purposes, can be considered nonexistent and not worthy of government-funded study.] Answers to some of these and other research questions posed by such CAM concepts may be found in the study of Ayurvedic medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tibetan medicine, Native American medicine, medicine of Africa, Latin American and Caribbean medicine, as well as naturopathic medicine, chiropractic, and other systems of healing. Applying rigorous scientific methods to the exploration of such frontier areas of inquiry may require merging whole system concepts with objective measurements used in research. It will also require the input of CAM professionals working with experts in a wide variety of fields, including but not limited to physics, cell and molecular biology, genetics, immunology, physiology, chemistry, neurobiology, epidemiology, psychology, sociology, and engineering. In addition to NCCAM, which has issued a request for applications to foster research in frontier areas of inquiry, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and the National Science Foundation are examples of Federal organizations that should consider contributing collaboratively or independently to the support of research on core CAM questions in areas described in many CAM systems. [This appears to be a call for many government agencies to devise ways to modify their standards and develop techniques so that methods that are patently ridiculous can be given high-priority research status.] Moving Non-approved Treatments to Clinical Investigation Physicians and other health care practitioners who believe they have promising data on non-approved CAM treatments need more assistance in moving successfully to clinical investigation of the treatment while meeting their professional, ethical, and human subject protection responsibilities. It is essential to note here that, in addition to Federal requirements concerning research, all CAM and conventional practitioners, whether or not they are engaged in research, must meet whatever State practice requirements or standards govern their authorization to practice. [There is no reason to modify accepted researcyh standards merely because methods are labeled as \"CAM.\" In CAM research, as in conventional research, the following standards apply: 1) the practitioner engaging in research must be knowledgeable about the collection of objective and valid observational data and record keeping; 2) the investigation of the treatment must be part of a well designed study that meets rigorous scientific standards; and 3) protections for human subjects and IRB guidelines must be in place and followed. Practitioners, however, often do not have the expertise, the resources, or the time to conduct high-quality, scientifically rigorous practice-based research. They need both the support of research institutions and the opportunity to collaborate with expert researchers in evaluating their observations and in designing and implementing clinical studies. [There is no logical reason to believe that special training for CAM advocates is likely to be a good investment. Nor would it make sense to promote the careers of people who want to test implausible hypotheses.] To help implement and accelerate the process, NIH and other Federal agencies, as appropriate, should develop programs to evaluate practice-based observational data as the basis for potential research support and communicate the availability of such programs to practitioners. If a project merits funding, CAM practitioners and CAM-trained researchers should be part of the research team. These programs may also offer training in data collection, the scientific method, protocol development, and ethical guidelines and human subject protection. Support for research can be obtained as well from reputable, high-quality private or nonprofit institutions or organizations, which could develop ways to assist practitioners in moving successfully from preliminary data to quality clinical research. The NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine conducts reviews of practice-based data through its best-case series program. Members of the Cancer Advisory Panel for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAPCAM), medical oncologists, and CAM experts also provide NCCAM with a field investigation function to collect and evaluate outcomes data on promising complementary and alternative cancer therapies. To stimulate practitioner response, NCCAM in collaboration with NCI, has called for the submission of case histories through notices in leading conventional and CAM periodicals, with letters, and at meetings. This effort has resulted in one study under way, another under negotiation, and a third under review. NCCAM has also, through the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, contracted with the RAND Corporation to compile data histories of best-case studies for review and assessment by CAPCAM. NCCAM has also explored a pilot project with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop methods for identifying practitioners who have data on new therapies and to conduct systematic reviews of the case files and identify practices worthy of research support. [NCCAM and its predecessors have supposedly been doing this for years and have nothing to show for it.] Using both the NCI best-case series and the NCCAM collaboration with NCI as a model, concerted efforts are needed to continue strengthening existing outreach activities to CAM practitioners and conventional researchers and to create outreach programs for evaluating practice-based observational data in additional areas of research. Activities should also offer guidance and training to facilitate the move by CAM professionals from promising preliminary data to scientifically rigorous clinical studies. [This falsely assumes that the process is likely to find promising treatments and that the people who run quack cancer clinics will provide honest reports.] Recommendation 1: Federal agencies should receive increased funding for clinical, basic, and health services research on CAM. Actions |1.1||Federal agencies should increase their activities with respect to CAM in accordance with their biomedical research, health services research, or other health care-related responsibilities and make these activities, including available technical assistance, known to CAM and conventional researchers and practitioners. Activities might include funding initiatives such as requests for applications and proposals; CAM-focused offices or centers; CAM-focused staff positions; CAM advisory committees or the representation of qualified CAM professionals on such committees. [Research priorities should depend on the likelihood that projects will yield significant results and not on whether or not they are marketed as \"CAM.\"]| |1.2||Federal agencies should assess the scope of scientific, practice, and public interest and needs regarding CAM that are relative to their missions, examine their portfolios, and develop funding distribution strategies to address these interests and needs. [Since \"public interest\" is not necessarily related to effectiveness, it should not be a major factor in determining research priorities.]| |1.3||The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality together with The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine should develop ways to expand health services research in CAM and explore methodologies for health services research in this area. [NCCAM and its predecessors have produced no significant findings during its ten years of existence. It makes more sense to abolish it than to increase its funding.]| |1.4||The Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support more research on (1) complex compounds/mixtures frequently found in CAM products, (2) clinical interventions consisting of multiple treatments, (3) how patient-practitioner interactions affect treatment outcomes, and (4) individualizing treatments. [Identifying the active ingredients of promising herbs is a worthwhile endeavor that has been taking place for decades. But this recommendation also supports clinical research on crude extracts (chemical mixtures) that is likely to be unproductive. It might also be useful to study patient-practitioner interactions. However, research expenditures and other incentives should be proportional to probable value, not whether something is labeled \"CAM.\"]| |1.5||n order to protect public health and maximize benefits, Congress should provide adequate public funding for research on frequently used or promising CAM products that would be unlikely to receive private research support. [This falsely implies that their are many promising \"CAM\" products. Frequency use should be considered only if a product appears to be effective.]| |1.6||The Federal government should support research on CAM practices that appear to be effective but may not be profitable to private investors, such as biofeedback, meditation, guided imagery, art therapy, and music therapy. [Research priority should be related to the probability of obtaining useful results, not according to whether something is marketed as \"CAM.\"]| Recommendation 2: Congress and the Administration should consider legislative and administrative incentives to stimulate private sector investment on research on CAM products that may not be patentable. Actions |2.1||Incentives to stimulate private sector investment in CAM research should focus on (1) research on dietary supplements and other natural products that may not be patentable; (2) research on other CAM products that may not be patentable, including therapeutic devices; and (3) the development of analytical methods for producing better quality CAM products. [Research priority should be related to the likelihood of useful results and not to whether products are classified as \"CAM.\"| |2.2||The Federal and private sectors should provide support for workshops to discuss the research needed by regulatory agencies for their review and approval processes for CAM products and devices. [This recommendation puts the cart before the horse. CAM advocates do not need special training in how to get things approved. Regulatory approval is based on proof of safety and effectiveness. Whether methods are standard or are labeled \"CAM\" is not relevant. What counts is whether or not they work.]| |2.3||Federal agencies should develop outreach programs to inform manufacturers of CAM products and devices about the Federal research support available to private industry and how the agency can assist them.| Recommendation 3: Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support research on CAM modalities and approaches that are designed to improve self-care and behaviors that promote wellness. [Research priorities should be determined by the likelihood of useful findings and not whether they are identified as \"CAM.\" Proven self-care and wellness strategies are part of mainstream public health and should not be identified as \"CAM.\"] Recommendation 4: Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support innovative research on core questions posed by CAM in frontier areas of scientific study that might expand our understanding of health and disease. Actions |4.1||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, assisted by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, should develop guidelines for establishing research priorities in CAM . [NCCAM has supposedly been doing this for many years.]| |4.2||The National Science Foundation, in collaboration with The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, should examine frontier areas of science associated with CAM that are outside the current research paradigm and methodological approaches to study them. [This falsely assumes that that \"frontier areas of science associated with CAM\" are rational but cannot be tested by established research methods. This appears to include alleged supernatural forces such as\"electromagnetic energy flow\" that cannot be measured with scientific instruments.]| |4.3||Multidisciplinary workshops and expert panels should be convened by Federal, private and nonprofit organizations, collaboratively or independently, to explore the challenges in design and methodology presented by research questions in CAM areas that are outside the current research paradigm. [The fact that quack methods cannot be substantiated does not mean that science-based standards of evidence should be lowered.]| |4.4||The National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense are among the Federal organizations that should consider contributing collaboratively or independently to the support of research on core questions in areas described in many CAM systems. [This is a blatant pitch for more research funds for studying methods marketed as \"CAM.\" Research dollars should be allocated according to potial usefulness rather than how they are designated.]| |4.5||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, working with the World Health Organization, should examine investigative approaches for studying the traditional systems of medical practice from a variety of cultures. [The study of folk healing is probably not a cost-effective way to discover new methods.]| Recommendation 5: Investigators engaged in research on CAM should ensure that human subjects participating in clinical studies receive the same protections as are required in conventional medical research and to which they are entitled. Actions |5.1||Licensed practitioners using CAM systems and modalities who wish to conduct or collaborate in clinical research should follow the same requirements as in conventional medical research. They should develop, or partner with a research institution to develop, a scientifically valid research protocol and obtain Institutional Review Board approval to ensure that they meet accepted standards of ethical conduct and their responsibilities to protect human subjects. [These are standard operating procedures for scientific research.]| |5.2||Accredited CAM institutions and CAM professional organizations should establish Institutional Review Boards where possible, and guide their colleagues and members to utilize the Institutional Review Board process, which is required to conduct clinical research.| |5.3||Institutional Review Boards that review CAM research studies should include the expertise of qualified CAM professionals in the review.| |5.4||Research institutions, National Institutes of Health Institutes and Centers, and other Federal research and health care agencies should be more proactive in developing programs that (1) provide opportunities for expert review of promising CAM practice-based observational data by experienced researchers, (2) stimulate practitioner response to the opportunities offered by the programs and (3) facilitate communication and stimulate partnerships between CAM practitioners and conventionally-trained researchers in designing and implementing clinical studies.| Recommendation 6: The Commission recommends that State professional regulatory bodies include language in their guidelines stating that licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized practitioners who are engaged in research on CAM will not be sanctioned solely because they are engaged in such research if they: 1) are engaged in well-designed research that is approved by an appropriately constituted IRB, 2) are following the requirements for the protection of human subjects, and 3) are meeting their professional and ethical responsibilities. All CAM and conventional practitioners, whether or not they are engaged in research, must meet whatever State practice requirements or standards govern their authorization to practice. [This proposal, if implemented, would enable practitioners of quack methods to escape rstate egulatory action by setting up their own Institutional Review Boards.] Dialogue, Partnerships, and Public Input Emerging Dialogue and Collaboration between CAM and Conventional Medicine Largely in response to the public's use of CAM practices and products, an emerging dialogue between CAM and conventional medicine appears to be taking place, along with a growing willingness to study CAM and experiment with its inclusion in health care [5]. This gradual change, which presents an exciting and hopeful prospect for meaningful collaborations, is reflected in an increase in cooperation and opportunities for cooperation between CAM and conventional health care professionals and institutions. A major challenge facing both CAM and conventional medicine is to foster this emerging dialogue and, by doing so, increase mutual respect and better understanding of one another's expertise, concerns, and contributions. Strengthening the dialogue will not only help protect the public from unsafe treatments, but will also expand opportunities to improve health care. A recent national survey indicates that most people who use CAM value both CAM and conventional approaches [6]. [The survey didn't determine whether the \"CAM\" approaches were valuable. It just determined that they had been used.] The goal of integrative medicine is to identify the most appropriate treatments available from a broad spectrum of evidence-supported care [7]. [This description is marketing hype. There is good reason to believe that it is inaccurate.] To name just a few examples, in integrative cancer treatment, a patient may undergo individualized acupuncture treatment for nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy [expensive and not proven cost-effective]; relaxation techniques and support groups [used decades before the \"CAM\" concept was popularized] are used with cancer patients to reduce stress, improve mood, and enhance the immune system; and mind-body interactions and stress management are being studied with respect to the treatment of hypertension and coronary heart disease. [The claim that psychological techniques enhance the immune system is a flat lie. Moreover, cancer is not a disease of the immune system.] The Commission supports collaboration between CAM and conventional medicine and believes that combining the best of CAM with conventional medical care may help reunite the art and science of medicine. [There are no data and no logical reason to believe that \"CAM\" approaches are more humane.] Applying the Same Standards It is the view of some CAM professionals that the requirements for CAM research are higher than for conventional research. [The corect way to express this is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.] On the other hand, some representatives of the conventional medical research community have expressed the belief that CAM research often is not held to as high a standard as conventional research. [The correct way to say this would be that CAM research is rarely high-quality and that CAM advocates don't seem to mind.] The Commission's position is that the same high standards of quality, rigor, and ethics must be met in both CAM and conventional medical research, research training, publication of research results in scientific and medical journals, presentations at research conferences, and review of products and devices. [If \"CAM\" research were high quality and lack of effectiveness would lead to abandonment of ineffective methods, the \"CAM\" community would be decimated. Note carefully, however, that the WHCCAMP report does not contain a single sentence stating conditions under which any \"CAM\" practice should be disgarded.] Cooperation and Partnerships Cooperation and partnerships are at the heart of the challenge to foster dialogue and improve the quality of CAM research and the success of research applications, including those that may lie outside mainstream research. Building working relationships among professionals from conventional medical, allied health, and CAM disciplines is essential to progress in studying CAM practices and products. The absence of these relationships impedes progress in building knowledge about CAM and establishing the appropriate use of CAM within the health care system. [There is no reason why genuine scientists should affiliatiate with screwballs.] To be most effective, CAM and conventional researchers, clinicians, practitioners, and the leadership of their institutions and organizations need to communicate with one another and form working relationships. Federal and State research and health care agencies, the private and nonprofit sectors, and the public are also integral to this cooperative environment that gives the scientific and health care community an opportunity to raise the quality of CAM research and improve the research infrastructure. [This assumes that \"CAM\" methods hold sufficient promise to warrant such affiliations.] The effective regulation of CAM research, the publication of CAM research results, and the review and approval of CAM practices and products also depend on increased interaction among these various constituencies. [Regulation is ultimately in the hands of legislators who care more about being re-elected than about upholding scientific practice. The assumption that research will lead to more effective regulation is dead wrong.] Therefore trained, experienced, and properly qualified CAM and conventional medical professionals need to be represented on research, journal, regulatory, and health insurance review and advisory committees, as well as in discussions on CAM-related research policy issues. [Insurance companies don't need \"CAM\" practitioners to help them determine what services to cover. The relevant consideration is whether a practice has been proven safe and effective for intended purposes. The scientific community does not need help from \"CAM\" advocates to interpret scientific studies.] Because conferences, workshops, and expert panels are excellent instruments for enhancing communication, participants at such meetings should include CAM and conventional medical and health care professionals and the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. As stated earlier, multidisciplinary meetings offer the opportunity for people from a broad variety of disciplines and interests to build on each others' knowledge and experience in discussions about promising research topics and research planning, program development, and policy considerations, and to explore innovative methodological approaches to solving difficult research questions in focused CAM areas. [This falsely assumes that \"CAM\" advocates have something extraordinarily useful to offer.] Examples of interdisciplinary activities that have contributed to progress in CAM include the conference on \"Exploring Opportunities for Collaboration with Industry\" supported by NCCAM, the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation's \"Conference on the Education of Health Professionals in Complementary/Alternative Medicine,\" the conference on \"Building Bridges: the Link between Allopathic and Alternative Medicine in Clinical Practice and Research\" sponsored by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and School of Hygiene and Public Health and the Traditional Acupuncture Institute, and the Center for Mind-Body Medicine's \"Comprehensive Cancer Care Conference\" cosponsored by NCI and The symposia and conferences on \"Complementary, Alternative and Integrative Medical Research\" sponsored by the Harvard Medical School, Division of Research and Education in Complementary and Integrative Medical Therapies are another example of this type of activity. Federal public health grants for conference support, such as the R13, H13, and T14 [8], are available to qualified applicants. [The question could be asked whether these conferences accomplished anything beyond enabling \"CAM\" advocates from trumpeting the fact that they participated in conferences with prominent sponsors.] Partnerships and collaborations between and among public, private, and nonprofit organizations are also very important to the support of CAM research. Interested nonprofit organizations should consider pooling their resources, independently or collaboratively with the public or private sectors, to support interdisciplinary conferences on CAM research, as well as to support CAM research, research infrastructure and training at CAM institutions, and the dissemination of CAM information. [There is no logical reason to believe that collaboration, special funding, or special training for CAM advocates are likely to be good investments. Nor would it make sense to promote the careers of people who want to test implausible hypotheses. The best \"training program\" is a solid education in the sciences.] Public Input and Public Use The public's growing influence on the health care system has created a need for more research, including population-based research on why people are turning to CAM, as well as a need to ensure public participation in shaping the direction of CAM research. [Public views are shaped largely by advertising and marketing rather than effectiveness. In its 1998 report, Scientific Opportunities and Public Needs, the Institute of Medicine described public input as an essential and integral part of the democratic process, which if done well, can improve the knowledge base for public policy decisions. The report goes on to recognize the intense public interest in health issues, and agreement on the part of the public, Congress and the Executive Branch that investing in research is the right thing to do [9]. [Research priorities should be based on the likelihood of benefit. While public interest should influence where research dollars go, medical scientists themselves are in the best position to determine which methods \u2014 among a huge number of possibilities \u2014 are most likely to yield important and useful results by doing rigorous scientific studies. The best \"public representatives\" are scientists who have had high-quality training.] Federal requirements and opportunities for public participation in the shaping of health care research and related activities currently exist. Examples include the NIH Director's Council of Public Representatives, which was recommended by the Institute of Medicine, and the long standing requirement that there be public members on NIH advisory councils, boards, and committees, Food and Drug Administration advisory committees, and IRBs [10]. Such opportunities are available to members of the public representing CAM research and related areas. Public members of Federal advisory committees as well as the agencies they advise would gain from programs designed to orient and train them on how to provide their input most effectively, particularly with regard to 1) moving from promising basic science findings to clinical treatments, 2) identifying health services research needs, and 3) improving the dissemination of research information. Because of the increased use of CAM products and the published reports of adverse events, including loss of therapeutic drug effectiveness and compromised perioperative care, the NIH Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center established a policy in June 2001 requiring that all inpatients and outpatients be asked, during the admission process, about their use of herbal or other dietary supplements. There is also a growing trend to include questions about herbal or other dietary supplement use in research protocols. The possibility of including such questions in all NIH Clinical Center IRB protocols is being considered. The knowledge gained from this questioning would benefit research subjects and future protocol development by contributing important information about the use of dietary supplements and other natural products [11]. The collection of such information may in the future also offer a data source for research on consumer use of CAM. Because reliable information, including patient disclosure, is necessary to ensure informed decision making, patient safety and valid research outcomes, it is once again clear that 1) more research is needed on CAM practices and products and 2) health care professionals and researchers need to be knowledgeable about CAM. Recommendation 7: Increased efforts should be made to strengthen the emerging dialogue among CAM and conventional medical allied health practitioners, researchers and accredited research institutions; Federal and State research, health care, and regulatory agencies; the private and nonprofit sectors; and the general public. Actions |7.1||CAM and conventional medical researchers and practitioners should adhere to the same high standards of quality and ethics in all aspects of research and related activities. [This is self-evident but exaggerates the likelihood that \"CAM\" researchers and practitioners can achieve high standards of quality and ethics.]| |7.2||Federal agencies should develop programs to stimulate cooperation and partnerships between CAM and conventional medical professionals and accredited institutions. [This exaggerates the likelihood that \"CAM\" practitioners can enter into useful partnerships with science-based practitioners and their institutions.]| |7.3||Committees reviewing or advising on research, journal submissions, regulatory compliance, and health insurance coverage in both the public and private sectors should include as members or consultants trained, experienced, and properly qualified CAM health care professionals. [This falsely implies that many \"properly qualified CAM health professionals\" exist. TMoreover, the choice of experts should be based on the quality of their work rather than how they label and market themselves.]| |7.4||Multidisciplinary conferences, workshops, and expert panels on CAM research and related activities, including research methodology, should be supported independently or collaboratively by the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. [Such intermingling would have political value for \"CAM\" proponents but is unlikely to add to scientific knowledge.]| |7.5||The nonprofit sector and the private sector should create funding partnerships, whether independently or with Federal agencies, to augment support for CAM research, research infrastructure and training, research conferences, and information dissemination. [Nonprofit and private organizations can give money to whomever they please. Allocation of government funds should be based on scientific standards, not how methods are classified.]| |7.6||The Federal government should support research, including population-based research, to learn more about why people use CAM practices and products, how they determine the safety and effectiveness of the practices and products they use, and what they find satisfying or unsatisfying about them. [If done properly, research of this type could be used to educate people on how to avoid being quacked. But the statistics could also be used to promote irrational methods by trumpeting about how popular they are.]| |7.7||To benefit patients and future research protocol development and to add to our knowledge about the use of CAM, Institutional Review Boards should consider requiring that all research subjects be asked about their use of herbal or other dietary supplements. [This might be important if using dietary supplements or herbs could confound the data. But routine questioning might convey an underlying message that the products are so important that they deserve special consideration.]| |7.8||Federal agencies supporting biomedical and health services research should develop orientation and training programs for public representatives to enhance the effectiveness of their participation on advisory committees concerned with CAM. [It does not make sense to train people whose judgment is so poor that they advocate wildly implausible hypotheses.]| Research Training and Infrastructure A strong research infrastructure is crucial to training skilled investigators to study CAM questions, producing grant applications in CAM that successfully compete for support, and conducting rigorous CAM research. Sustained, adequate funding is essential to building and maintaining a long-term research capacity for training clinical investigators and health services researchers in CAM, and for training scientists who are interested in studying the underlying mechanisms of CAM products, practices, systems and concepts. A government-wide effort involving NIH, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs and other Federal agencies would strengthen the funding and strategic planning for developing or enhancing CAM research sites and training programs. Supporting research training and infrastructure in accredited CAM institutions would help build their capability to conduct high quality research and enhance their opportunities to form research collaborations with conventional medical research centers. Accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions might consider developing joint research and professional education and training programs to enhance the quality and clinical relevance of CAM research and link the research with evidence-based education and training of practitioners. [This calls for politicization of all medical research. Research dollars should be used to study which methods \u2014 among a huge number of possibilities \u2014 are most likely to yield important and useful results. The best \"training program\" is a solid education in the sciences.] The Need for Rigorous Training The same rigorous training is required for both CAM and conventional medical researchers and must be available to both. Conventional researchers need to understand CAM concepts and approaches, and both CAM and conventional investigators must have thorough training in the fundamental elements of quality clinical, basic, or health services research. Training should include a strong grounding in 1) the research process and methodology, 2) the collection and recording of unbiased data, 3) all aspects of protocol or study design and execution, 4) an understanding of the expertise needed to form a research team, 5) IRB and other regulatory requirements, and 6) the grant application, submission, and review processes. [Appropriate training in scientific methods is widely available at academic centers throughout the world. There is certainly no good reason to train people just because they label themselves as CAM practitioners.] Research training in CAM should also teach multiple outcomes measures, including social and biopsychological measures of health, and offer experience working as part of a multdisciplinary research team. The opportunity to gain solid training in a supportive environment on how to conduct quality research in CAM should continue to attract students from both CAM and conventional medicine who are interested in studying CAM questions. In addition, all Federal agencies that have training programs as part of their health care missions should support the training of researchers to address CAM-related questions that are relevant to their missions. Elements of a Strong Research Infrastructure Research sites, whether supported publicly, privately, or by foundations, need to be strategically located and structured to conduct basic, clinical, and health services research, adequately train researchers and clinical experts, and deliver integrated care services. The success of each site depends on a critical mass of personnel, equipment, basic and clinical research expertise, core laboratory facilities, and clinical environments with access to patients. CAM research sites should be developed at public, private and accredited CAM institutions with both CAM-trained and conventional medical professionals serving on faculty or as consultants and with experienced researchers serving as mentors. Cooperation between CAM and conventional medical researchers and institutions and joint research grant applications can contribute to success in obtaining funding. Current Research and Research Training Activities and Opportunities Academic health centers at conventional institutions offer excellent venues for exchanging experiences with CAM professionals on how best to educate conventional researchers in CAM practices and how to introduce CAM practitioners to the conventional research culture. Conventional health centers are gradually including CAM in their research, research training, clinical, and medical education activities. For example, the Medical Center Health System of the University of Pennsylvania, recognizing that CAM therapies merit evaluation, recently reviewed the role of CAM in the medical center and health system and is beginning to incorporate the study of CAM therapies into its research, clinical, research training and educational activities, including stimulating interdisciplinary collaboration [12]. Harvard University, Duke University, the University of Maryland, the University of Oregon, the University of Washington, Georgetown University, and many other institutions across the country have incorporated CAM into their academic health centers; each has done so in its own way. Some conventional health centers have cooperative arrangements with CAM institutions and such cooperation should be encouraged. [One reason for the \"incorporation\" has been the availabilty of funding from NCCAM. Whether anything useful results from the process remains to be seen.] Accredited CAM institutions are gradually expanding their activities to develop research and research training capacity, form interdisciplinary collaborations, and establish cooperative arrangements with conventional health centers. For example, a neurophysiology laboratory focusing on research of interest to the chiropractic field has been established at the Parker College of Chiropractic by a conventionally trained neurophysiologist. NCCAM has awarded grants to CAM institutions, such as the Bastyr University Naturopathic Medicine Program, the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine, the Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention of the Maharishi University of Management, and to a consortium of chiropractic colleges. The number of accredited CAM institutions that receive research support should increase as their capacity to conduct rigorous research improves and they submit more applications. [The number of accredited \"CAM\" institutions doing research is not large. Whether any of them will generate useful findings remains to be seen.] NCCAM provides funding for approximately 15 CAM Specialty Centers of Research in collaboration with other NIH institutes and centers and the Office of Dietary Supplements. In addition to botanicals, the specialty centers focus on such areas as arthritis, women's health, pediatrics, cardiovascular disease, addiction, cancer, and craniofacial disorders. These Centers as well as others supported by NCCAM offer research training opportunities. NCCAM and the other institutes and centers are encouraged to develop a cadre of well-trained CAM and conventional medical investigators in basic, clinical, or health services CAM research and to support career development awards. The Commission also encourages support of CAM research training and infrastructure by the private and nonprofit sectors. The General Clinical Research Centers, supported by the NIH National Center for Research Resources, form a national network of hospital-based centers that provide a research infrastructure for clinical investigators who receive NIH and other Federal agency support, and an environment and resources for developing future scientists in clinical research. In addition to the NCCAM-supported centers, the General Clinical Research Centers might offer opportunities to conduct clinical research and training in CAM and examine the inclusion of CAM in the clinical setting. [A few significanbt studies of individual hers are under way. Whether any of them will generate useful findings remains to be seen.] In addition to continued strong support for pre- and post-doctoral fellowship (F) and institutional (T) research training awards, CAM research trainees need experienced mentors. Incentives may have to be developed to attract mentors to this field. Strong support of career development (K) awards \u2014 including those that enable investigators focusing on CAM to develop into independent investigators and faculty members, and mid-career awards to provide the time required to mentor new CAM investigators \u2014 are of considerable importance [13]. Also, the NIH Loan Repayment Program is offered to individuals holding doctoral degrees who participate in clinical research. Among those who are eligible are, DCs, NDs, and OMDs [14]. Recommendation 8: Public and private resources should be increased to strengthen the infrastructure for CAM research and research training at conventional medical and CAM institutions and to expand the cadre of basic, clinical, and health services researchers who are knowledgeable about CAM and have received rigorous research training. Actions |8.1||Funding should be made available to accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions develop programs that examine CAM research questions and that stimulate cross-institutional collaborations involving faculty and students in research and research training.| |8.2||Funding should be made available to accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions support joint research and professional education and training programs to enhance the quality and clinical relevance of CAM research and link the research with evidence-based education and training of practitioners. [This falsely assumes that training advocates of irrational practices will lead to valuable results. There is no logical reason to assume that it will. Moreover, CAM is a marketing term, not a genuine field of health care.]| |8.3||Federal health agencies with research training programs and responsibilities that encompass CAM-related questions should be given adequate support to increase research training in CAM. [This falsely assumes that training advocates of irrational practices will lead to valuable results. There is no logical reason to assume that it will. Moreover, CAM is a marketing term, not a genuine field of health care.]| |8.4||Existing resources, such as The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine-supported centers and the National Center for Research Resources' General Clinical Research Centers should be utilized to increase opportunities to conduct clinical research and training on CAM and examine the inclusion of CAM into the clinical setting. [Despite nearly ten years of distributing grant money, NCCAM and its predecessors have produced no useful clinical research findings. It makes no sense to increase their funding.]| |8.5||Federal support should be increased for career development awards, including those that enable investigators focusing on CAM to develop into independent investigators and faculty members, and mid-career awards that provide the time required to mentor new CAM investigators. [The basis for training career investigators should be the quality of their work, not whether they label or market themselves as \"CAM\" investigators.]| CAM Research Results: Systematic Reviews and Evaluations Publication of CAM Research Results in Peer-Reviewed Journals Publication of CAM research results in recognized, rigorously peer-reviewed research journals is needed to provide reliable information about CAM to researchers, practitioners, and ultimately the public. Decisions on regulating the use of and reimbursement for CAM therapies should be based on published evidence of safety (including toxicity, side effects, and adverse interactions), clinical efficacy, general effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses rather than on traditional use, anecdotal reports, consumer interest, and market demand. The quality of the research and the standards of review required for journal publication affect how readers determine the reliability and usefulness of the information. To ensure a fair and accurate review, both CAM and conventional medical and scientific expertise should be represented on journal review boards when reviewing CAM research submissions. Systematic Reviews Reviews of published research from sources such as the Cochrane Collaboration's collection of systematic reviews, the evidence-based reports developed by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, and the databases of the National Library of Medicine, such as PubMed and MedlinePlus, are valuable resources for scientists, research planners, practitioners, community health centers, policy makers, and the public. The Commission is pleased with these organizations' CAM-related activities, especially their efforts to cooperate with one another, and their collaborations with NCCAM. Efforts to increase the availability of concise and understandable summaries of the research literature for the public and other audiences through MedlinePlus and other dependable information sources should be supported. Examples that could be effectively applied to CAM-related information are the Department of Health and Human Services' \"Report of the U.S. Preventive Task Force Guide to Clinical Preventive Services,\" which is a complete assessment of the literature on preventive medicine, and the more recent British Medical Journal publication, Clinical Evidence, which regularly updates information on clinical evidence. [This falsely suggests that many \"CAM\" methods could be endorsed by prestigious review bodies.] Recommendation 9: Public and private resources should be used to support, conduct, and update systematic reviews of the peer-reviewed research literature on the safety, efficacy, and cost-benefits of CAM practices and products. Actions |9.1||The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality should expand its Evidence-based Practice Center systematic reviews on CAM systems and treatments for use by private and public entities in developing tools, such as practice guidelines, performance measures, and review criteria, and for identifying future research needs. [This falsely implies that current methods of scientific review are defective and that \"CAM\" methods should be reviewed differently.]| |9.2||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine should issue a comprehensive, understandable, and regularly updated summary of current clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of CAM systems and treatments for health care practitioners and the public. [Many such summaries have been published. Whether more would serve any useful purpose would depend on who compiles them and whether their conclusions are supported by scientific evidence. To date, neither NCCAM nor WHCCAMP has ever publicly concluded that any \"CAM\" method is worthless and should be abandoned. The call for dissemination of \"evidence\" attempts to conceal how little there is that is worth disseminating.]| References - National Institutes of Health, Office of Extramural Research.

[Appropriate education would inform students that homeopathy is worthless, chiropractic \"subluxations\" are delusions, the flow of \"chi\" through \"acupuncture meridians\" is a nonsensical concept, and chelation therapy doesn't work. It is safe to assume that the Commission does not have this type of reality in mind.] Thus, the education and training of conventional health professions should include CAM, and the education and training of CAM practitioners should include conventional health care. The result will be conventional providers who can discuss CAM with their patients and clients, provide guidance on CAM use, collaborate with CAM practitioners, and make referrals to them, as well as CAM practitioners who can communicate and collaborate with conventional providers and make referrals to them. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities.] Reaching this goal will require development of CAM faculty, curricula, and programs at both CAM and conventional institutions. Because of increased consumer demand for CAM services and products, national curricular elements should be established for CAM education and training. However, the Commission recognizes the barriers to and voluntary nature of such national curricular elements. An evaluation should be undertaken of whether postgraduate training should be established for appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners. Continuing education programs should be developed for and required of all practitioners who provide CAM services and products. Finally, students of CAM want to participate in loan and scholarship programs, and it is important that this participation be evaluated. [This falsely assumes that there are enough useful \"CAM\" methods to warrant special emphasis.] Recommendation 10: The education and training of CAM and conventional practitioners should be designed to ensure public safety, improve health, and increase the availability of qualified and knowledgeable CAM and conventional practitioners and enhance the collaboration among them. Education in CAM for Conventional Health Care Professionals In 1995, a national conference on complementary and alternative therapy education recommended that CAM be included in nursing and medical education [1]. Although there has been notable progress in introducing CAM into medical, nursing, and other fields of conventional health care education in recent years, more needs to be done. [The main needs is to make sure that the information presented is accurate.] For example, in 1997, 64 percent of allopathic medical schools reported offering elective courses in CAM or including such topics in required courses [2]. Data from all 125 allopathic medical schools in response to the 2000-2001 Liaison Committee on Medical Education Annual Medical School Questionnaire indicate that although no medical school requires a separate CAM course, 91 schools include CAM in required conventional medical courses, 64 offer CAM as stand-alone elective, and 32 include CAM as part of an elective. Required and elective courses included acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, meditation, manual healing techniques, nutritional supplement therapy, and spirituality, according to the questionnaire. (Table 1). - Table 1. CAM Topics Included in Required or Elective Courses at Medical Schools Accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. Topics Required Course Only Elective Course Only Both Acupuncture 18 54 28 Herbal medicine 28 45 33 Homeopathy 17 48 18 Meditation 13 53 17 Manual healing techniques 15 50 11 Nutritional supplement therapy 30 42 36 Spirituality 25 43 35 - Source: 2000-2001 Liaison Committee on Medical Education Annual Medical School Questionnaire. More than one response could be chosen, so the total number of responses does not equal the number of respondents. In a study of an allopathic medical school with no formal or elective courses in CAM, third-year medical students were found to have insufficient knowledge about the safety of 10 common CAM modalities [3]. These modalities included massage therapy, herbal medicine, meditation, chiropractic, hypnosis, spiritual healing, acupuncture, homeopathy, reflexology, and naturopathy. The authors of this study recommended including CAM topics in the medical school curriculum to better prepare the practicing physician for soliciting information from patients about current CAM use, responding to patients' inquiries about CAM, and assessing the merit of introducing a CAM modality into, or removing it from patients' care plans. [An accurate picture of these practices could be provided in a 2-hour session that highlights the irrational practices that most of them involve.] Courses in CAM offered at conventional medical schools differ widely in content, format, and requirements [4]. In light of this variation, consensus needs to be reached on the essentials of a core curriculum [1]. In November 2000, the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation convened a conference to develop guidelines for teaching CAM in medical and other health professional schools. The participants concluded that efforts to expand knowledge about CAM should extend beyond the education of medical students to all conventional health professionals [5]. Addressing the myriad conventional health professions and programs will require a range of educational options. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities.] CAM Conventional Health Care Professions Curricula While CAM can be taught in stand-alone courses, it may be more effectively and efficiently integrated into allopathic medical school curricula by combining it with current initiatives such as evidenced-based medicine, cultural competence, and interdisciplinary collaboration. CAM in medical education has evolved to the point where two fundamental questions need to be answered: What should be taught, and how should it be taught? CAM taught in the context of conventional medical education should be evidence-based [6]. New educational programs for physicians need to be developed that include the conceptual basis of CAM practices, along with a critical review of the safety and efficacy of CAM practices and products. This information should be incorporated into required courses of medical school curricula and graduate training programs, not relegated to electives, whose content may not be critically evaluated [7]. While many CAM courses are taught from either an advocacy or neutral view, all CAM courses should be taught critically [8]. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities. Note carefully that the WHCCAMP report does not criticize any \"CAM\" method. ] Georgetown University School of Medicine plans to integrate CAM into the entire medical school curriculum as part of a recent grant from the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). [This is the home territory of WHCCAMP Chair James S. Gordon, MD. Students who are interested in getting scientific medical training would be well advised to go elsewhere.] Other innovative efforts to integrate CAM with existing medical school curricula are already underway; however, these efforts are geographically dispersed, not well known, and not systematically studied. They range from informal CAM seminars, such as brown bag lunches with CAM practitioners sponsored by student groups, to formal symposia or debates of controversial CAM issues by authorities with opposing views. While survey and other lecture courses are efficient ways of presenting a large volume of information, CAM is being integrated into a variety of courses. For example, information on acupuncture is being integrated into basic science courses, such as anatomy or physiology, as well as clinical courses, such as neurology, while herb-drug interactions are being included in pharmacology. All of these methods of teaching about CAM offer opportunities to present the history, culture, and philosophy of CAM and training of CAM practitioners as well as a critical analysis of published research on its safety and effectiveness. They also provide opportunities to communicate effectively with CAM practitioners and discuss CAM comfortably and accurately with patients. However, these didactic opportunities can be coupled with opportunities to experience CAM personally, particularly mind-body approaches and stress management, as part of self-care. This is being done at the George Washington University Center for Integrative Medicine through a Department of Education Fund for Improvement of Post-Secondary Education grant. A cogent argument for including self-care in medical education is that the health and well-being of medical students has been so neglected that by the end of their training, they often feel drained of the compassion and spirit that drew them to medicine [9]. In addition, students who learn the fundamentals of self-care will be better able to teach their patients to care for themselves. [There is no reason to believe that \"CAM\" education will provide any useful self-care measure that is not included in conventional medical training. Nor is there good reason to believe that relaxation exercises are an important part of self-care.] Medical education should include opportunities to experience CAM approaches, such as meditation and relaxation therapy, for students who personally may benefit from these approaches during their stressful journey through medical school. [This assumes that many students will benefit from these. No evidence to support this assumption is cited.] Postgraduate and Continuing Education Although the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine has published suggested curriculum guidelines on CAM and recommended that CAM knowledge, skills, and attitudes be incorporated into family practice residency training [10], very few postgraduate CAM training opportunities exist for physicians and other conventional health care providers. [That's because there is very little worth teaching.] One of the most extensive postgraduate CAM training programs is at the University of Arizona. This two-year fellowship in integrative medicine is limited to four allopathic or osteopathic physicians per year who have completed residency training. To expand the availability of training in integrative medicine, the University of Arizona recently created an associate fellowship program. Combining distributed-learning and on-site training, this two-year associate fellowship is available to 50 allopathic and osteopathic physicians and a small number of nurse practitioners per class at a cost of $27,500 for the class entering in 2003. Other postgraduate training opportunities are evolving. One is at The Continuum Center for Health and Healing at New York's Beth Israel Medical Center, which has developed not only a required rotation in integrative medicine for a family medicine residency, but also a two-year fellowship in integrative medicine. Even though the number of postgraduate training opportunities in CAM is very small indeed, there are more CAM postgraduate educational opportunities for physicians than for other conventional health care professionals. The number of continuing education programs in CAM for conventional health professionals appears to be growing. This is an important trend, since continuing education is one of the chief means by which the current generation of conventional health professionals learns about CAM. Despite these efforts and the creation of the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, more needs to be done to move from discourse to implementation of CAM in the education, postgraduate training, and continuing education of not only allopathic physicians, but also osteopathic physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and all other conventional and allied health professions. A catalyst could be a conference or series of workshops facilitated by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and other Federal Departments and Agencies. These gatherings would bring together individuals and representatives of institutions, professional and accrediting organizations, and the Federal government who have been involved with recent and on-going efforts to develop core curricula of knowledge about CAM for conventional health professionals. The elements of these core curricula should be developed in conjunction with CAM experts and institutions and implemented in conventional health professional schools, postgraduate training programs, and continuing education programs. The core curricula, educational models, evaluations, recommendations, and other relevant information could be compiled and posted on the Internet at a variety of Federal and non-Federal websites, with links to related websites. [This is a blatant call for federally funded promotion of unsubstantiated methods and their advocates throughout our medical educational system. Just the opposite is needed. Science-based accrediting bodies should attack the quackery that that has infiltrated medical education within the past few years.] However, this strategy does not address the education and training needs of conventional health care students and providers who desire an integrative approach and wish to go beyond learning about CAM to learning how to provide CAM. This type of practice-oriented education and training in CAM should be obtained in appropriate conventional health care postgraduate training and continuing education and at CAM institutions. The challenges to developing core curricula of knowledge about CAM for conventional health professional schools, postgraduate training programs, and continuing education programs include: - Professional, organizational, and institutional difficulty changing, - Lack of funding, - Provision of adequate incentives to adopt these curricula, - Logistical design, development, and implementation issues, - Consensus on curricula, - Availability of adequately trained faculty and faculty development, and - Limited ability to add to already very full curricula. [What nonsense! The main \"challenge\" is the fact that methods unique to \"CAM\" offer almost nothing of value to patients.] Action |10.1||Conventional health professional schools, postgraduate training programs, and continuing education programs should develop core curricula of knowledge about CAM to prepare conventional health professionals to discuss CAM with their patients and clients and help them make informed choices about the use of CAM. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| Education in Conventional Health Care for CAM Practitioners CAM education should be a symmetrical process. That is, the education and training of CAM practitioners should include exposure to conventional health care and its related sciences just as the education and training of conventional health professionals should include CAM [11]. CAM students should attain basic competency in the biomedical sciences and understand the components and functions of the conventional health care system, including public health. This foundation should be augmented by an evidence-based approach to education and training to achieve minimal competency in interpreting CAM and conventional literature and critiquing CAM research, particularly clinical trials. [WHCCAMP again demands that the entire medical education system be corrupted by giving CAM advocates free reign to promote their nonsense.] The core curriculum for CAM students should include clinical competencies such as medical record keeping, knowledge of medico-legal aspects of care, practice in a referral environment, collaboration with conventional providers, and communication within a health care team. Students should learn to recognize the limits of their clinical expertise as well as potential complications of CAM interventions, the circumstances under which patients or clients should be referred to conventional health care providers, and the means of doing so. Additional competencies should include a basic knowledge of other CAM systems, modalities, practices, and approaches as well as when and how to refer patients or clients to those CAM practitioners. [The Commission again fails to mention anything about irrational or ineffective methods.] The elements that should be contained in the core curriculum for CAM education and training and the best methods of incorporating them into existing curricula could be determined by conferences facilitated by DHHS and other Federal Departments and Agencies or by a series of demonstration projects conducted at representative CAM education and training programs. These demonstration projects could be supported, for example, by NCCAM, Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr), the Department of Education, foundations, and innovative partnerships. Since these two approaches are not mutually exclusive, both conferences and demonstration projects could be undertaken, if adequate funding were available. These models, evaluation results, and recommendations should be compiled and made available through several sources, including the Internet. [Standards, methods, and curricula should be based on scientific knowledge of what works and what does not. Whether or not something is called \"CAM\" is not relevant.] The challenges to developing a core curriculum about conventional health care for CAM education include: - Professional, organizational, and institutional difficulty changing, - Lack of funding, - Provision of adequate incentives to adopt curriculum, - Logistical design, development, and implementation issues, - Consensus on curriculum, - Availability of adequately trained faculty and faculty development, and - Limited ability to add to already very full CAM curricula. Action |10.2||CAM education and training programs should develop curricula that reflect the fundamental elements of biomedical science and conventional health care relevant to and consistent with the practitioners' scope of practice. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" deserve advocacy in training programs.]| Communication and Collaboration between CAM and Conventional Health Care Professionals The language of biomedicine is currently as foreign to many CAM professionals as much of CAM terminology is to conventional health care professionals. Therefore, commonality of language should be the initial focus of improving communication between CAM and conventional health care professionals, and it should begin in CAM education and training programs. Minimal fluency in biomedical language should be foremost in a core biomedical curriculum for CAM education and training programs. [This appears to be another endorsement of a two-tier system of medicine: one based on science and another based on non-science. The Commission's recommendation is just the opposite of what is needed to maintain the integrity of our science-based medical system.] CAM organizations could be the point of contact for conventional institutions seeking CAM practitioners to teach CAM courses and provide relevant examples of practice. These organizations also could help locate CAM practitioners to participate in CAM research projects conducted at conventional institutions. At the organizational level, joint conferences could be held between CAM and conventional organizations representing students, practitioners, researchers, educators, or institutions. [This falsely assumes that \"CAM\" advocates have a lot to offer.] The challenges to attaining and improving communication and collaboration between CAM and conventional students, practitioners, researchers, educators, institutions, and organizations include: - Achieving consensus on biomedical fluency and other educational strategies, - Professional, organizational, and institutional difficulty changing, - Securing sufficient funding, - Designing, developing, and implementing logistics involved with joint activities, and - Providing adequate incentives to improve communication and collaboration. Action |10.3||CAM and conventional education and training programs should develop curricula and other methods to facilitate communication and foster collaboration between CAM and conventional students, practitioners, researchers, educators, institutions and organizations. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" deserve advocacy in training programs and that the offerings \"CAM\" advocates are likely to be trustworthy.]| Increased Support for CAM Faculty, Curricula, and Program Development Access to increased funding and other resources for CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at both CAM and conventional institutions could result in better CAM education and training. [Conventional institutions include not only allopathic medical schools, but also osteopathic medical schools and dental, nursing, pharmacy, and all other health professional and allied health schools.] This, in turn, could translate into more skilled practitioners, improved CAM services, and greater patient satisfaction and safety. Although CAM faculty, curricula, and program development can be regarded as a continuum, faculty development is the most important and pragmatic point at which to begin. Faculty development is not only absolutely essential for any educational improvement, but also the cornerstone of CAM education and improved training at CAM and conventional institutions. However, the current, limited funding for this purpose appears to be directed toward only a small number of curricula and program development projects at largely conventional institutions. The type of faculty development needed by CAM and conventional institutions may be different and may vary from institution to institution. For conventional institutions, it can include providing experience in CAM systems, modalities, and therapies; teaching faculty how to collaborate with CAM practitioners and educators; and instructing them how and what to teach about CAM. For CAM institutions, faculty development can include how to teach using evidence-based, problem-based, and competency-based approaches and other educational techniques appropriate for their students and how to collaborate with conventional providers and educators. [WHCCAMP again demands that the entire medical education system be corrupted by giving CAM advocates free reign to promote their nonsense.] CAM programs at conventional health care institutions could encompass a variety of activities, including the development of CAM, integrative health, or integrative medicine clinics or centers, integrative medicine residencies and fellowships, and CAM research programs. These clinics or centers can be sites for student clinical rotations, residency and fellowship training, and clinical research and research training, particularly health services research. Juxtaposing CAM education, training, and research with conventional approaches can focus CAM research on clinically relevant topics, improve the quality of research, especially that conducted by CAM practitioners, and link CAM research with evidence-based education and training. This juxtaposition is essential for acceptance of CAM by evidenced-based conventional health care. Because CAM institutions are more heterogeneous than conventional institutions, the program needs of CAM institutions are significantly more varied. Although CAM institutions ought to be able to pursue support of their unique program needs, some CAM institutions may be more successful by forming partnerships with conventional institutions to undertake joint activities and programs. Examples of successful partnerships between CAM and conventional institutions include the Bastyr University and University of Washington and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine and the Oregon Health Sciences University. According to the available data, most support from NCCAM for education and training has been given to conventional institutions. [NCCAM established the CAM Education Project Grant (PAR-00-027) in response to Public Law 105-277, which mandated that the director of NCCAM \"study the integration of alternative treatment, diagnostic and preventive systems, modalities, and disciplines with the practice of conventional medicine as a complement to such medicine and into health care delivery systems in the United States.\"] Between fiscal years 2000 and 2001, 10 CAM Education Project Grants (R25) were made by NCCAM to accelerate the development, refinement and expansion of innovative educational approaches to incorporate CAM into medical, dental, nursing, and allied health professional school curricula, into residency training programs, and into continuing education courses. Grant recipients in 2000 were the Boston's Children's Hospital, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, the University of Minnesota -Twin Cities, the Rush-Presbyterian - St. Luke Medical Center, and the University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston. Recipients in 2001 were the Maine Medical Center, the Georgetown University School of Medicine, the Tufts University School of Medicine, the University of Michigan School of Medicine, and University of Washington School of Medicine/Bastyr University. It is important to note that NCCAM is considering a similar program for CAM institutions, but this program has not gone through the concept clearance process. Limited support of CAM training and education programs also has been provided by BHPr. The Bureau's Division of Nursing has funded three graduate programs that contain content on CAM, as well as the Chiropractic Demonstration Project Grants Program. The latter supports research projects in which chiropractors and physicians collaborate to identify and provide effective treatment for spinal and low-back conditions. All of the BHPr education and training programs are established legislatively through Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. These programs are directed toward specific health disciplines delineated in the legislation and allow very little, if any, latitude in allocation of funds. Currently, chiropractic research is the only BHPr CAM activity that is legislatively authorized. Both NCCAM and BHPr examples illustrate how legislation drives funding of CAM education and training. Therefore, it ultimately may be necessary to pass new legislation or amend current legislation to support CAM education and training. Before that can be done, however, it is necessary to identify effective CAM education and training strategies and programs. This can be accomplished through a series of demonstration projects for CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions and subsequent evaluation of the various models and publication of the findings in print and on-line. [This falsely implies that there are many effective \"CAM\" methods.] Since faculty, curricula, and program development at both CAM and conventional institutions can benefit from collaborations and the economies of scale they provide, collaboration should be an essential element of these demonstration projects. Wherever possible, joint demonstration projects should be undertaken to take full advantage of combining programs and sharing faculty, expertise, facilities, and resources. [This falsely implies that mainstream and \"CAM\" practitioners have some sort of equivalence.] Additional sources of funding sources for CAM education and training need to be found. It may be possible to obtain funding from other NIH institutes and Federal Agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Agency for Health Care Quality and Research, and Department of Education. Funding from states, foundations, and other public and private sources should be explored also. [Training subsidies should be based merit and not on whether or not someone is described as a \"CAM\" practitioner.] Bringing funding sources together with organizations such as the Association of American Medical Colleges, the American Association Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, the American Dental Education Association, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, the Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions, the Association of Schools of Public Health and comparable CAM organizations can help in identifying programs, faculty, resources, and opportunities to improve CAM education and training. Identification of funding sources, collaboration between funding sources and organizations, and development of selection criteria for competitive awards for CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions could be achieved through Federally sponsored workshops and conferences. The challenges facing efforts to increase support for CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions include: - Limited availability of funding in an era of diminishing resources and increased competition, - Resistance from conventional health professions' organizations and institutions, - Equitable identification and prioritization of appropriate recipients for funding, and - The need for Federal legislation and appropriations to support such programs. [The big \"challenge,\" of course, is that \"CAM\" is mostly smoke and mirrors.] Action |10.4||Increased Federal, state, and private sector support should be made available to expand and evaluate CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions. [This is a blatant call for promotion of unsubstantiated methods and their advocates throughout our medical educational system. Just the opposite is needed. Science-based accrediting bodies should attack the quackery that that has infiltrated medical education within the past few years.]| CAM Student Participation in Existing Loan and Scholarship Programs CAM students, institutions, and professional organizations have expressed considerable interest in participating in loan and scholarship programs. Chiropractic students were eligible for participation in the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program [as authorized by the Public Health Service Act, Title VII, Section 705], the program has been phased out, and no initial loans are available. Chiropractic students at participating institutions now may be eligible for Stafford loans. Currently, the only CAM students eligible for the Scholarship for Disadvantaged Students (SDS) program are chiropractic students [as authorized by the Public Health Service Act, Title VII, Section 705]. [It should be pointed out that chiropractors have by far the highest loan default rates.] No CAM students are eligible for the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) scholarship program at this time [as defined in the Public Health Service Act, Title III, Section 301], because it is limited to U.S. citizens enrolled in or accepted for enrollment in fully accredited U.S. allopathic or osteopathic medical schools, nurse practitioner programs, nurse-midwifery programs, physicians assistant programs, or dental schools. In other words, only students of a health profession that is named specifically in authorizing legislation can be awarded an NHSC scholarship. The purpose of the NHSC scholarship program is to provide primary health care to underserved and vulnerable populations in rural and urban areas designated by the Federal government as health professions shortage areas. As a result of program requirements and limitations as well as other factors, NHSC, which recently was transferred within HRSA from the Bureau of Primary Health Care to BHPr, meets approximately 12-15 percent of the identified need for health care in underserved areas. Because of the enormous unmet need, especially for primary care, and the limited number of NHSC positions and funds available, the government's and medically underserved communities' clear preference for conventional health care providers should not be unexpected. [Few \"CAM practitioners\" can function competently as primary care physicians. This recommendation, if followed, would result in irreparable injury to many people as well as the public health generally. It also calls for taxpayers' dollars to support irrational methods.] Any policy changes regarding CAM participation in Federal loan and scholarship programs would have to be mandated legislatively. Expansion of eligibility for loan programs administered by BHPr, such as Loans for Disadvantaged Students, Health Professions Student Loans, or Primary Care Loans, to CAM students would require, at a minimum, financial impact analyses by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), determination of which CAM professions should participate, determination of which loan programs should be expanded, and amendment of the Public Health Service Act, Title VII. Since participation in these programs is based in part on financial need, only CAM students meeting the financial eligibility criteria would be eligible. Expansion of eligibility for the Stafford loan program administered by the Department of Education would have to be preceded by similar CBO evaluations, determination of which CAM professions should participate, and legislative changes. In addition, CAM institutions would have to be accredited by an approved accreditation agency, apply and be approved for participation in Title IV of the Higher Education Act student assistance program, and sign a participation agreement. In general, expansion of Federal loan programs to CAM students appears easier than participation in the NHSC scholarship program. However, before considering any changes in NHSC policy or legislative, a number of critical aspects of CAM participation must be examined. Since the chief purpose of this program is not education, but the provision of health care to medically underserved and vulnerable populations, current participants must be able to provide the necessary health care services, which generally are described as or included as a component of primary care. [There is no logical reason to believe that a shortage of \"CAM\" practitioners exists.] Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act defines primary care by delineating required community health center primary care services and provides examples of representative clinical competencies. These include: - Health services related to family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, or gynecology that are furnished by physicians and where appropriate, physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurse midwives; - Diagnostic laboratory and radiologic services; - Preventive health services (including prenatal and perinatal services; screening for breast and cervical cancer; well-child services; immunizations against vaccine-preventable diseases; screenings for elevated blood lead levels communicable diseases, and cholesterol; pediatric eye, ear, and dental screenings to determine the need for vision and hearing correction and dental care; voluntary family planning services; and preventive dental services); - Emergency medical services; and - Pharmaceutical services. The Department of Health and Human Services should conduct a feasibility study to determine whether appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners enhance and/or expand health care provided by primary care teams. [No study is needed. The answer is no.] These primary care teams typically consists of family practitioners, internists, pediatricians, and obstetrician gynecologists as well as physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, dentists, and mental health professionals. The feasibility study could be followed with demonstration projects to determine the type of practitioners, their education and training requirements, appropriate practice sites, minimal clinical competencies, and health outcomes attributable to the addition of these practitioners and services to comprehensive care. Then, the CBO should estimate the financial impact of CAM practitioner participation in these programs. Guidelines have been set for determining the number of a given type of conventional health care provider for a defined population size or geographic area (for example, an area that has a population to full-time-equivalent primary care physician ratio of at least 3,500 to 1), but not for CAM practitioners. Such guidelines would need to be developed for each type of CAM practitioners. The challenges to expanding the eligibility of CAM students to participate in existing loan and scholarship programs include: - A preference for conventional health care providers to fill the largely unmet need, - Required changes in legislation and appropriations changes, - Identification of specific CAM disciplines and practitioners, and - Difficulty in administering CAMinclusive programs particularly in the absence of population and geographic guidelines for CAM practitioners and financial impact data. Action |10.5||Expansion of eligibility of CAM students at accredited institutions for existing of loan programs should be explored. [This would help subsidize students at schools of acupuncture and naturopathy whose teachings advocate irrational practices such as homeopathy.]| |10.6||The Department of Health and Human Services should conduct a feasibility study to determine whether appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners enhance and/or expand health care provided by primary care teams. [Typically, these primary care teams consists of family practitioners, internists, pediatricians, and obstetrician gynecologists as well as physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, dentists, and mental health professionals.] This feasibility study could lead to demonstration projects to identify: 1) the type of practitioners, 2) their necessary education and training, 3) the appropriate practice settings, and 4) the health outcomes attributable to the addition of these practitioners and services to comprehensive care. [This falsely implies that \"CAM\" advocates have a lot to offer. However, adding ineffective methods to effective ones will increases the cost of health-care delivery but not its quality.]| National Guidelines for CAM Educational and Training Questions about national guidelines for CAM education and training are by no means unique to the United States. In Great Britain, the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology considered a number of issues related to CAM education and training [12]. Despite the exceedingly complex mosaic of CAM practices, therapies, modalities, disciplines, and professions, the committee recommended that CAM training courses, whether for conventional health professionals or CAM professionals, should be made more uniform and should be accredited by appropriate professional bodies. [This falsely assumes that \"CAM\" training courses have a lot to offer.] National standards for CAM education and training may not be attainable in the United States for a number of reasons. For example, each of the 50 States has varying educational requirements for licensure for a multiplicity of professions. In addition, a given CAM modality or therapy may involve numerous CAM and conventional disciplines; but there may be no agreement among or between disciplines on accreditation requirements, processes, or body for that particular modality or therapy. [The standards for \"CAM\" should be the same as for science-based practices. The Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education [ACCME] already has an adequate standard. It does not approve programs that advocate irrational methods.] In an attempt to provide some uniform guidance, the Federation of State Medical Boards' Special Committee for the Study of Unconventional Health Care Practices has begun to develop guidelines for the use of CAM. These guidelines address education, but they focus on the scientific basis of treatment methods without delineating any specific education or training requirements. Simultaneously, nascent efforts by physician organizations to standardize CAM education and training for allopathic and osteopathic physicians have emerged. The American Board of Holistic Medicine, for example, has administered a board certification examination covering 13 areas of holistic medicine, including exercise medicine, nutritional medicine, environmental medicine, biomolecular medicine, behavioral medicine, spiritual medicine, energy medicine, social medicine, manual medicine, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, ethnomedicine including acupuncture, and conventional medicine. For physicians practicing medical acupuncture, the American Board of Medical Acupuncture has developed and administered a board certification examination. [It is not possible to develop science-based guidelines for irrational practices. Homeopathy and \"energy medicine\" are delusional practices. Any organization that certifies people in these areas should be considered untrustworthy. The fact that WHCCAMP uses the American Holistic Medical Association as an example of what should be done shows that the WHCCAMP majority is similarly untrustworthy.] Chiropractic has the most extensively developed and implemented national education and training standards of any CAM profession. [Its standards are extremely low and poorly enforced.] Traditional Chinese acupuncture, therapeutic massage, and naturopathic medicine perhaps have moved closer than other CAM professions to establishing national education and training standards. [In 2001, the U.S. Secretary of Education revoked its approval of naturopathy's national accrediting body.] Because of their progress, these CAM professions are appropriate candidates for conferences convened by DHHS and other Federal Departments and Agencies, although CAM professions and disciplines that are still in the process of developing standards should be included as well. Such conferences would assemble the leadership of CAM, conventional health, public health, evolving health professions, and the public; educational institutions; and appropriate organizations to facilitate establishing CAM education and training guidelines. Subsequently, these guidelines would be made available to the states and professions for their consideration. The challenges of establishing national CAM educational and training guidelines include: - Their similarity to education and training requirements for licensure and therefore perceived encroachment on states' rights, - Complexity-that is, the numerous disciplines or professions that may be associated with a given modality, - Lack of educational standardization within professions, - Absence of a clearly delineated scope of practice for each profession; - Funding requirements, and - Resistance from CAM and conventional professions and organizations. [The big \"challenge\" is the extent of irrational practices that \"CAM\" professions involve.] Action |10.7||The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal Departments and Agencies should convene conferences of the leaders of CAM, conventional health, public health, evolving health professions, and the public; of educational institutions; and of appropriate organizations to facilitate establishment of CAM education and training guidelines. Subsequently, the guidelines should be made available to the states and professions for their consideration. [This falsely assumes that rational guidelines can be written for teaching irrational methods.]| Demonstration Projects of Postgraduate Training for Appropriately Educated and Trained CAM Practitioners To improve education and training, the competency of practitioners, and the quality of services, CAM education and training should continue beyond the entry, professional school, or qualifying degree level. However, as previously noted, there are very few opportunities for postgraduate CAM education and training. Currently, the chiropractic profession appears to have the most extensive full-time postgraduate CAM education and training, offering residencies in radiology, orthopedics, family practice, and clinical sciences. A typical chiropractic residency program is two to three years in duration and includes outpatient care and inpatient clinical rotations at chiropractic and conventional medical facilities, along with classroom and research experiences. [This description grossly exaggerates the extent and quality of postgraduate chiropractic education.] Residencies in naturopathic medicine are less well developed. Postgraduate training has been in existence since 1979 and consists of a limited number of mainly one-year and some two-year residency programs with an emphasis on naturopathic family practice. Most of these residencies are based in outpatient clinics, some of which are affiliated with a hospital. Utah now requires at least a one-year residency for licensure of naturopathic physicians. Before establishing new or expanding current CAM postgraduate education and training programs, appropriate CAM candidates for postgraduate education and training should be identified and the feasibility, type, duration, and impact of postgraduate education and training for these CAM practitioners should be determined. For example, should one-year postgraduate training programs be available for traditional Chinese acupuncturists or doctors of oriental medicine? Should three-year primary care or family practice residencies be available for naturopathic, Ayurvedic, or Tibetan medicine physicians? [The more important question is whether graduates of these schools can provide rational health care.] The process of determining likely candidates could include demonstration projects of residencies and postgraduate training for appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners. Federal Agencies and Departments such as NCCAM, BHPr, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs could sponsor the projects. Because community health centers represent a unique opportunity for combining education in ethnically, racially, and culturally diverse learning environments with service to medically underserved populations who otherwise might not have access to CAM, any current or proposed CAM postgraduate education and training program affiliated with such centers should be given special consideration. [This falsely implies that there is a shortage of \"CAM\" services among economically underprivileged populations and that this provides an adequate basis for more federal subsidies.] Demonstration projects should be awarded on a competitive basis and funded with monies that are distinct from the current graduate medical education funding streams. In addition, projects should include funds for financial analyses and longitudinal studies to assess the types of CAM practitioner, feasibility of residencies and postgraduate training, competency-based educational effectiveness, impact on health care quality, and collaboration between CAM and conventional providers. [This falsely implies that the public has a special unmet need for \"CAM\" services. In effect, the Commission would like the U.S. Government to fund demonstration projects for methods before they are proven effective.] The challenges to establishing demonstration projects of residencies and postgraduate training in CAM for appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners include: - Determining which practitioners should participate in postgraduate education and training demonstration projects, - Developing and applying selection criteria and processes, - Funding, and - Limited availability of a sufficient number of training sites, patients, and faculty. Action |10.8||Feasibility studies of postgraduate training for appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners should be conducted to determine the type of practitioners, practice setting, and their impact on clinical competency, quality of health care, and collaboration with conventional providers. [Here WHCCAMP demands that residency training be corrupted by giving CAM advocates free reign to promote their anti-scientific nonsense.]| Continuing Education in CAM for All Practitioners Who Provide CAM Products and Services Continuing education represents a powerful means of affecting conventional and CAM practitioners' behavior, thereby enhancing public health and safety. Britain's House of Lords affirmed the importance of continuing education for CAM practitioners [12]. The Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation Conference on Education of Health Professionals in Complementary/Alternative Medicine recommended that professional and educational health care associations include high-quality, evidenced-based CAM information in continuing education programs [5]. There are more programs in CAM continuing education for conventional health professionals than for CAM practitioners. However, the number, type, and availability of programs with content appropriate for all practitioners who provide CAM services and products are not sufficient to enhance and protect the public's health and safety regarding CAM. Therefore, continuing education needs to be improved and made available to all conventional health professionals as well as all practitioners who provide CAM services and products. [Current continuing medical education standards state that organization and course is not eligible for accreditation by ACCME if, in the judgment of the ACCME, its program is devoted to the advocacy of unscientific modalities of diagnosis or therapy.] Action |10.9||Practitioners who provide CAM services and products should complete appropriate CAM continuing education programs that include critical evaluation of CAM to enhance and protect the public's health and safety. [There is no reason to expect that science-based CAM continuing education programs can be created or that \"CAM\" practitioners would attend such programs or be influenced by them. To be \"appropriate,\" such programs would have to advocate abandonment of \"CAM\" methods that are irrational.| References: - Berman B. Complementary medicine and medical education.

[Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD, and Timothy N. Gorski, MD]One of society's greatest achievements \u2014 and one of its greatest challenges \u2014 has been the dramatic improvement in the development and dissemination of information. Over the past several decades, new technologies have enabled people all over to world to gain rapid access to information. Not only does information travel faster, significantly more of it has become available in the United States because of increased population, higher educational levels, and changes in the workforce and economic structure. This is especially true of health information, including information about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). In a desire for improved quality and length of life, the public has sought increased information on healing systems, practices, and products from other cultures and healing traditions. Many Americans use these in the context in which they were originally developed. Others have borrowed practices and products from these systems and adapted, changed, or used them in ways that are very different from their original design or intent. New therapies, practices, and products that lie outside the conventional health care system have also been developed. All of these fall under the rubric of CAM, and people have both benefited and suffered from information about their usage, benefits, safety, and effectiveness. [This falsely implies that widely available information about \"CAM\" practices and products is largely accurate and provides benefits with little harm.] To ensure public safety in the continually evolving area of CAM, accurate information must be available so that people can make informed choices. [This is a truism, but most of members of the Commission have been spreading misinformation for many years.] This includes choosing the most appropriate type of practitioner, deciding what type of approach can benefit certain conditions, ascertaining the ingredients in a product (such as a dietary supplement), and determining whether ingredients are safe and can assist in maintaining health. Yet far too often information to help make these choices is nonexistent, inaccurate, or difficult to find. [The amount of information is huge, but most of it is untrustworthy.] The ready availability of accurate information is especially important to people who are confronting a life-threatening illness. For someone newly diagnosed with a serious or life-threatening illness, seeking information about the disease and treatment options is often their first course of action. Many people quickly become overwhelmed by the vast array of often-conflicting information that is available, and yet for some diseases and conditions, there is a scarcity of information. Getting accurate and useful information should not be an additional burden during this difficult time. [This implies that \"CAM\" is important to people with serious and lifehtreatening illnesses. Few \"CAM\" methods that might be useful for seriously ill people can actually influence the course of the ailment. The information most needed is about what to avoid rather than whatb to use.] To be effective, information must be tailored to the population it seeks to reach. People of different cultural, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds often have different views of health and healing, different patterns of use of health care services and products, and different ways of acquiring information. People's views and behavior also vary with their age, literacy, and specific health conditions. Informational materials need to reflect the characteristics and behavior of the target population in content, style, language, and format. The Internet has given people access to vast amounts of health care information that would not have been available to them previously. Along with the advantages of being able to find information on virtually any topic quickly, the Internet presents concerns about quality, particularly in regards to CAM information. People may be making life-and-death decisions based on information from the Internet that may be misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate. [Since the Commissioners know that this is happning, it is curious that they use the weasel-word \"may.] This is particularly true in the case of CAM, for which a significant amount of evidence-based material is not yet available. As people become more interested in CAM and explore the Internet looking for information about its usefulness, efforts should be made to ensure that they have access to the most reliable information possible. [What they need most is information on what to avoid.] Other avenues of finding information about CAM are also important. The Federal government is one of the largest developers of health information, and efforts should be made to expand its coordination of existing CAM resources. [The only real gaps in government CAM information are (a) the failure to identify which CAM methods are worthless and (b) the failure of NCCAM and other government agencies to refer people to information sources that are justifiably critical of CAM methods. Setting up more agencies with similar policies would worsen the situation rather than improve it.] Public libraries are an important source of information in many communities. Training librarians in how to find information on CAM would help people navigate through the maze of available resources. [Whether that would useful would depend on who does the training and what is taught.] Advertising and marketing are another means through which people learn about CAM products and services. Although only a small percentage of the approximately $200 billion spent yearly on advertising [1] is for CAM products and services, that percentage nonetheless is significant. The vast majority of advertisers of CAM products and services comply with current laws, yet misleading and fraudulent health claims exist and are cause for great concern. [Advertising that is misleading does not comply with our laws. Most \"CAM\"-related advertising is misleading. The Commission has no factual or evidentiary basis for claiming otherwise.] Some people, particularly those who are ill, have limited language or educational skills, or lack access to the conventional health care system, are especially susceptible to advertisements that promise to cure a disease, symptom, or problem. Not only are some of these products, services, and treatments ineffective, some may even be harmful, especially if they delay necessary treatment or take money away from those with limited resources. Efforts to enforce existing laws curbing such abuses should be increased. [This is an excellent recommendation. However, although stronger federal action could drive many \"CAM\" entrepreneurs out of business, the U.S. Congress is dominated by \"CAM\" advocates who have seriously weakened consumer protection during the past decade. If WHCCAMP really wants more protection for consumers, it should advocate repealing the [Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act of 1994,](https://www.quackwatch.org/Quackwatch.com/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html) which severely weakened FDA enforcement powers. And it should also oppose \"CAM\" advocates' efforts to weaken FTC enforcement in the same way.] One of the fastest growing areas in CAM has been dietary supplements. Sales of these products totaled $17 billion in 2000 [2], and more than 158 million consumers used them [3]. Because they are classified as dietary supplements, these products are not subject to the rigorous testing and oversight required of prescription drugs, which are targeted toward disease conditions. For this reason, complete and accurate labeling and package insert information on ingredients and on potential benefits and risks is essential. The current system does not make such information easily available to consumers. [One reason for this is the [Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act of 1994](https://www.quackwatch.org/Quackwatch.com/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html), which classified herbs as detary supplements and made it nearly impossible for the FDA to regulate them.] The use of CAM practices and products is a growing part of the American lifestyle. As CAM continues to grow and evolve, the development and dissemination of accurate, complete, and useful information on products, practices, and practitioners will be one of the most important mechanisms for ensuring the public's safety. [Whether that would useful would depend on who does the training and what is taught. Actually, accurate information and appropriate law enforcement would decimate the \"CAM\" marketplace and lead to delicensing of the majority of \"CAM\" practitioners.] Availability of Reliable, Useful, and Accessible Information for the Public on CAM Practices and Products CAM Information from the Federal Government Consumers, health professionals, and the media often look to the Federal government for reliable and authoritative information on a wide range of health topics. The government produces thousands of fact sheets, reports, pamphlets, posters, books, and other materials that provide useful, accurate information on specific diseases, health care delivery services, research findings, and other health care topics. Information is also available though various government Internet sites and toll-free numbers, many of which are associated with a clearinghouse. [So far, the U.S. Government has ignored the vast majority of \"CAM\" practices that are irrational.] The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), located in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a congressional mandate to \"establish a clearinghouse to exchange information with the public\" about CAM [4.] The clearinghouse has a toll-free telephone number and provides fact sheets, information packages, and publications on CAM research and NCCAM activities. [NCCAM and its predecessors have not been a trustworthy source of information. They have consistently and deliberately avoided criticizing the majority of \"CAM\" methods that are irrational. In addition, consumers who call for information may be referred to unreliable sources.] Consumers and health care professionals can also obtain CAM- related information from NIH's National Cancer Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements. [The amount of useful information ifrom these agencies is small.] The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Food, Safety, and Applied Nutrition has a website with information on dietary supplements. Other government entities, such as the Department of Agriculture and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), also have information related to specific CAM topics. [The FDA, FTC and USDA distribute high-quality information but have not addressed most \"CAM\"-related practices that are irrational.] Despite these resources, information on CAM from the Federal government is inconsistently available and often difficult to locate. For a variety of reasons, including limited awareness or acceptance of CAM by Federal staff or leadership, lack of agency policy on the inclusion of CAM information, and limited availability of research on many of the CAM products and services people are using, government agencies with oversight responsibilities for various aspects of health care often do not include any information on CAM in their materials. This has resulted in significant gaps in information on diseases, health conditions, practitioners, and products. Existing materials should be reviewed and, where appropriate, CAM information should be added and new materials developed. [This would be a good idea if the information were accurate. However, the odds of that happening in today's political climate are slim. The Commission seems to be implying that the availability of accurate information about \"CAM\" would promote it, but just the opposite is true.] Even when high-quality, comprehensive information on CAM is available from the Federal government, it is often difficult for the public to navigate the system and locate the desired information in a timely manner. Greater efforts should be made to promote the use of the Firstgov.gov search engine, an easy-to-use government-wide search engine. For people who do not use the Internet, a centralized, toll-free telephone number would help direct callers to the appropriate department or agency to answer their questions. Consumers, health care practitioners, the media, and other members of the public have expressed a desire for a centralized place in the Federal government to get objective, comprehensive information on CAM quickly. [This would be a good idea if the information were accurate. However, the odds of that happening in today's political climate are slim.] CAM Information From Public Libraries Many people, especially elderly and low-income people, do not have access to the Internet or do not know how to use a computer to get CAM information on the Internet. People without access to the Internet at home or at work often use publicly available resources \u2014 such as libraries \u2014 to find information. Public libraries exist in most communities and are a source of Internet access and guidance. However, many librarians lack training in how to find reliable information about CAM on the Internet. They may also be unaware of other sources of information on CAM such as books, periodicals, and newsletters. The National Library of Medicine has begun working directly with public libraries through the American Library Association to train local librarians in how to use the Internet to find health information. This effort should be expanded to include more training and focus on how to find information about CAM, both on the Internet and in other resources. [The Commission seems to be implying that the availability of accurate information about \"CAM\" would promote it, but just the opposite is true.] The Role of Public and Private Organizations in Developing and Disseminating Information about CAM Differences in how people find and use information are an important consideration in the development, distribution, and evaluation of information about CAM. According to the most recent National Adult Literacy Survey, 48 percent of U.S. adults, or close to100 million people, have very limited literacy because they lack English skills, have reading disabilities, or lack sufficient education [5]. In addition to varying literacy skills, differences in how information is located and used can exist among men and women, people in different age or income groups, and people with different racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. Health information materials (print, radio, television, or other media) are often targeted toward specific audiences, particularly populations at higher risk of developing a particular disease or condition or those with a higher propensity for using a particular practice or product. Materials may be produced in different languages, and the content, illustrations, and style may be altered to reach the intended population. Currently available demographic data do not provide adequate information about CAM usage among various population subgroups or the range of methods and patterns in accessing CAM information. However, it is known that the use of CAM varies significantly by racial, ethnic, and cultural background, age group, health status, income, and literacy. CAM materials should be developed for each of these specific groups. Some populations are particularly susceptible to advertisements of CAM products such as herbs, tonics, and vitamins that have not been shown to be effective or that, in some cases, are even harmful. These populations may also be vulnerable to the fraudulent claims of services that promise to cure disease and treat health care problems not addressed through the conventional health care system. The involvement of trusted community leaders is essential to any effort to educate vulnerable consumers and develop strategies to prevent them from being targeted by marketing of unnecessary, harmful, exorbitantly priced, or otherwise detrimental products. [Whether or not the above activities are useful would depend upon who compiles and controls the information. So far \u2014 for political reasons \u2014 the government-generated teachings about CAM methods have been woefully inadequate. There is no reason to believe that additional funding will modify this situation.] CAM Information from Other Countries Lack of information on the effectiveness of CAM therapies is often cited as the reason for not providing them or reimbursing consumers for them. However, a potentially significant amount of high-quality CAM information has been published in other countries but is not available in English or in the United States. As globalization of information increases, the research, findings, and experiences of people in other countries can provide valuable information on the safety and efficacy of CAM. Identifying and analyzing studies published in languages other than English requires expertise in both languages and science. Greater efforts should be made to make these resources available. [This paragraph falsely implies that a large amount of information about the benefits of \"CAM\" products is available in other countries but not in the United states.] Recommendation 11: The Federal government should make available accurate, useful, and easily accessible information on CAM practices and products, including information on safety and effectiveness. Actions |11.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should establish a task force to facilitate the development and dissemination of CAM information within the Federal government and to eliminate existing gaps in CAM information. The task force should include consumers, CAM providers, scientists, and conventional health care practitioners. Resources should subsequently be provided to close identified gaps and improve the availability, coordination, and dissemination of information. [The only real gaps in government CAM information are (a) the failure to identify which CAM methods are worthless and (b) the failure of NCCAM and other government agencies to refer people to information sources that are justifiably critical of CAM methods. Setting up more agencies with similar policies would worsen the situation rather than improve it.]| |11.2||Federal Departments and agencies with missions or activities relevant to CAM should 1) develop informational materials about CAM that are easy to understand and use, and 2) support and collaborate with national and local community leaders and CAM leaders and organizations to identify strategies for enhancing the development, availability, and accessibility of information on the safety and effectiveness of CAM practices and products. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |11.3||Increased funding should be provided to the National Library of Medicine and the American Library Association to expand training of librarians to include helping consumers find information on CAM. [This is another way to promote dubious methods. Why should a particular subset of medical literature get special status or attention in libraries merely because it deals with unproven, disproved or irrational therapies? Moreover, it is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |11.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should direct resources to streamline the process of identifying and making available relevant, high-quality CAM information from other countries and in other languages. [This falsely assumes that other countries have high-quality \"CAM\" information available.| Quality and Accuracy of CAM Information on the Internet The Internet has emerged as a major source of information about health care, including information related to CAM, for both consumers and providers. According to the most recent estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau, over half of all households in the United States have computers, 90 percent of all children age 6 to 17 have access to computers through their home or school, and 42 percent of all households can log onto the Internet [6]. An estimated 60 million U.S. adults used it to obtain health-related information last year [7]. Most Internet sites are general health information sites that include CAM information, but some sites are specific to CAM. The quality, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness of Internet information vary greatly. Some sites provide accurate, up-to-date information, while many others contain information that is inaccurate, misleading, or outdated. The ability to ensure the quality of information on the Internet is extremely limited, both because of the nature of the technology and the First Amendment's protection of free speech. Several organizations have developed standards on ethics-related issues such as privacy and financial sponsorship of health sites on the Internet. However, some of these same organizations have developed websites that have been cited as having problems with quality, accuracy, accessibility, or timeliness of CAM-related information. [Cited by whom?] Some do not have any qualified CAM practitioners on their review boards, and the standards do not appear to have had much impact on the quality of information on these Internet health sites. [This falsely implies that qualified \"CAM\" practitioners exist and that editorial input from \"CAM\" practitioners would improve the quality of \"CAM\" informaiton on major health sites.] Public-private partnerships that include industry groups, consumers, and governments have been successful in developing guidelines and establishing standards for many products and services. Examples include the World Wide Web Consortium, a group of more than 500 public and private organizations that have developed guidelines to make web content accessible to people with disabilities, and the Healthy People Consortium, composed of hundreds of public and private organizations that have developed objectives for the Nation's health. The government can play an important role in bringing key people together to develop voluntary, non-binding guidelines that will assist industry in setting minimum standards for quality, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness of CAM-related information on the Internet. Regardless of efforts to develop standards and ensure quality, consumers will always need to evaluate and validate information they receive from the Internet. Public education in using the Internet as a source of health information can help individuals search for knowledge and make decisions about their health. [Nearly all of the WHCCAMP Commissioners are involved in the dissemination of false and misleading infomation. Perhaps they should be concerned with cleaning up their own acts.] Internet users are concerned not only about the quality and accuracy of the information they are getting, but also about the information they may unwittingly be giving out. In a recent study, 85 percent of people seeking health information on the Internet said they are concerned about their employer or health insurance company tracking their site visits and using that information to change their insurance status or rates [7]. Unfortunately, privacy protections for people seeking health information on the Internet are limited. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 protects the privacy of consumer information collected by health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers conducting electronic transactions, but it does not protect consumers seeking health information on the Internet. In 1998, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which prevents the collection of personally identifiable information from young children without their parents' consent. The FTC has filed four civil penalty actions this year to enforce the act, and additional cases are under investigation. Congress should take steps to expand privacy protection for health information seekers on the Internet. Recommendation 12: The quality and accuracy of CAM information on the Internet should be improved by establishing a voluntary standards board, a public education campaign, and actions to protect consumers' privacy. Actions |12.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should form a public-private partnership to review new and existing websites and to develop voluntary standards promoting accuracy, fairness, comprehensiveness, and timeliness of information on CAM web sites, as well as the disclosure of sources of support and possible conflicts of interest. Sites reviewed and found in compliance with the standards could publicize the fact and display a logo denoting their merit. [DHHS's healthfinder.gov already does a poor job of sorting out reliable and unreliable sources of CAM information. There is no reason to believe that another government-sponsored system would work better.]| |12.2||Funding should be provided to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education to conduct a joint public education campaign that teaches consumers how to evaluate health care information, including CAM information, on the Internet and elsewhere. [Whether or not such information is useful would depend upon who compiles and controls it. So far \u2014 for political reasons \u2014 the government-generated teachings about CAM methods have been woefully inadequate. There is no reason to believe that additional funding will modify this situation.]| |12.3||Congress should protect consumers' privacy by requiring all health information sites, including CAM sites, to disclose whether they track users and if so, how that information is used and stored, including whether it is sold to third parties. [Individual privacy should be protected regardless of what information is sought.]| Availability of Information on the Training and Education of Providers of CAM Health Services to Enhance Consumer Knowledge and Choice Training, licensing requirements, certification, scope of practice, regulations, and even definitions of CAM practitioners can vary considerably. For example, traditional or lay naturopaths and naturopathic physicians have significantly different levels and types of training, yet most consumers are unaware of the difference. [Since neither group is likely to provide rational health care, it may not make much difference which ones consumers select.] In some states, acupuncture can be practiced by professional acupuncturists who have spent several years in training or by practitioners of another health modality (e.g., a physician, dentist, podiatrist, physical therapist, or chiropractor) with less, limited, or no additional training or experience in acupuncture. [This falsely implies that medical doctors who practice acupuncture are generally less qualified than graduates of schools that tach \"Oriental medicine\" to nonphysicians. However, the opposite is true because most (if not all) \"Oriental medicine\" are not qualified to make competent diagnoses or render appropriate treatment.] Herbalists may have years of informal training and experience or no formal training and little experience. The situation is further complicated by state variations in licensing requirements and scope-of-practice regulations. [Since neither herbalist group is likely to provide rational health care, it may not make much difference which ones consumers select. Navigating the maze of titles and certificates among the various types of practitioners is a challenge for consumers, most of whom are unfamiliar with the nuances of these professions. Information on a practitioner's qualifications should be readily available to help consumers make informed choices in their selection and use of a practitioner. Information on state regulations, requirements, and disciplinary actions should be readily available to help ensure consumers' safety. [Consumers who want this information are already free to ask for it. Requiring qualified practitioners to provide it without being asked will merely increase their overhead. Requiring unqualified practitioners to disclose their background would only be useful if consumers could judge the validity of nonstandard credentials \u2014 something very few people can do. The real way to protect consumers is to prevent unqualified individuals from practicing.] CAM practitioners without any formal training may be reluctant to make that fact known. Moreover, consumers may not be able to distinguish between a degree or certificate obtained from an accredited organization and a degree or certificate purchased from an organization with no requirement that students meet appropriate educational standards. However, disclosure of such information will help consumers evaluate the qualifications of practitioners and make informed choices. In addition to practitioners, people such as vendors, retailers, and multi-level marketers of CAM products should disclose their qualifications for providing health-related information. [It should be made illegal to for anyone to practice any form of health care without appropriate credentials. Training from a nonaccredited school cannot prepare anyone for clinical practice in any are of health care. Public display of such credentials should be banned.] Recommendation 13: Information on the training and education of providers of CAM services should be made easily available to the public. Actions |13.1||The Commission recommends that states require all persons providing CAM services to disclose information regarding their level and scope of training and to make it easily available to consumers. [Consumers who want this information are already free to ask for it. Requiring qualified practitioners to provide it without being asked will merely increase their overhead. Requiring unqualified practitioners to disclose their background would only be useful if consumers could judge the validity of nonstandard credentials \u2014 something very few people can do. The real way to protect consumers is to prevent unqualified individuals from practicing.]| |13.2||The Commission recommends that states disclose information on State guidelines, requirements, licensure, certification, and disciplinary actions of health providers, including CAM providers, and make it easily accessible to the public. [Some state licensing boards already provide such information.Whether doing this is cost-effective and actually protects people has not been demonstrated. Curiously, far less public information is available about chiropractors than about medical doctors and other mainstream practitioners.]| Availability of CAM Products That Are Safe and Meet Appropriate Standards of Quality and Consistency The availability and use of dietary supplements in the United States has grown significantly in the past several years. As a result, public interest in the safety and effectiveness of dietary supplements has also increased. Because they are regulated as foods rather than drugs, dietary supplements are regarded -from a regulatory perspective \u2014 as generally safe for human consumption. Yet problems with the composition and purity of some of these products have been reported and raise questions about their safety. Some dietary supplements do not contain the ingredients or the amount of the ingredients declared on the label. For example, in laboratory testing of 25 separate Echinacea products, only 14 (56 percent) were found to have the amount and type of Echinacea and polyphenol (or marker compound) claimed on the label [8]. Testing of 13 SAMe (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) products showed that 5 had less than half the amount listed on the label and 1 had no detectable level at all [9]. An analysis of 25 ginseng products showed substantial variability in the concentration of marker compounds [10]. Some herbal preparations contain ingredients other than those listed on the label, including undeclared pharmaceuticals. Herbal products claiming to contain only natural ingredients were found to contain the prescription drugs glyburide and phenformin, which are used to treat diabetes [11]. Two other herbal products were found to contain warfarin and alprazolam, prescription drugs that can cause serious health effects if not taken under medical supervision [12]. Dietary supplements have been found to be contaminated with heavy metals, microorganisms, and pesticides, and toxic levels of mercury have been reported in some imported herbal products [13]. In April and May 2001, two manufacturers recalled several products as a result of Salmonella contamination [14]. Public concern with dietary supplements includes not only possible contamination and adulteration, but also active ingredients that may be toxic or cause unwanted side effects. For example, aristolochic acid, a naturally occurring compound associated with cancer and renal failure, has been found in several herbal products, prompting a nationwide recall of products containing this substance [15]. Certain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are found in numerous plants used medicinally around the world, have been found to be harmful to the liver [16]. Such examples raise questions about whether current regulations are adequate to ensure the safety of dietary supplements and whether regulatory agencies can respond quickly when a problem is identified. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, a manufacturer is responsible for determining that the dietary supplements it produces or distributes are safe and that its claims are substantiated by adequate scientific evidence. However, DSHEA does not require manufacturers to disclose the source of the information they used to determine the safety of their products. The failure to require safety data weakens the current regulatory system, making it unable to provide consumers with sufficient and scientifically valid information. [The first step in protecting consumers would be to repeal DSHEA, which was passed to weaken the FDA's ability to regulate herbs and idetary supplements.] Even though dietary supplements are regulated as foods, which are subject to the standards of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), DSHEA encouraged the FDA to develop separate GMPs for dietary supplements. The process of development has been an effective collaboration between many members of the dietary supplement industry and the Federal government. Implementation of GMPs for dietary supplements will help ensure the identity, purity, quality, strength and composition of these products. Formal publication and implementation of the GMPs are pending. [The overall effect of DSHEA has been to flood the marketplace with worthless products. Even if GMPs are established, DSHEA has made it impossible to enforce quality standards.] While implementation of GMPs for dietary supplements will address domestically produced products, finished products imported from some other countries may not meet these standards or the standards of responsible manufacturers. Such products may find their way into commerce. Appropriate government entities should work with manufacturers and importers to improve the monitoring of imported dietary supplements and prevent naturally or accidentally contaminated or adulterated products from entering the United States. Cooperation with appropriate international organizations should be encouraged in order to establish standards of quality for the ingredients in dietary supplements. These standards should include preventing the exploitation of endangered animal and plant species for the manufacture of dietary supplement products. Since the passage of DSHEA in 1994, many new dietary supplements have been introduced into the United States. For many of these supplements, particularly botanicals, validated analytical methods have not been developed. Moreover, different analytic methods are used by different manufacturers, leading to varying test results regarding concentrations of active ingredients or other marker compounds. Government, industry, and scientific organizations have begun developing analytical methods for botanicals and other dietary supplements so that consensus can be reached regarding the chemical and physical standards for composition and quality. These efforts need to be accelerated. Congress has included language in the fiscal 2002 appropriation bill for the Department of Health and Human Services in support of the development of standards, and the Commission recommends that this progress be continued. [This might be a good idea, but it will have little effect unless the FDA has more freedom to ban noncompliant products.] A framework for reviewing data on the safety of ingredients in dietary supplements is being developed by the Institute of Medicine. While this is an important step that will assist in improving the safety of specific ingredients of dietary supplements, the Commission believes that an independent review process is needed to evaluate the safety of dietary supplements, many of which contain multiple ingredients that can interact with drugs, foods, and other ingested products. An external review process was recommended by the Presidential Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels in 1997 [17] and more recently by a scientific conference [18]. Continuous, enhanced cooperation between government and industry is needed to make certain that dietary supplements are safe. [These might be a good ideas, but they will have little effect unless the FDA has more freedom to ban unsafe products. Consumer protection would be far greater if the FDA had the power to ban useless products and if manufacturers has to prove safety and effectiveness before making claims. However, DSHEA prevents both of these things from happening.] Recommendation 14: CAM products that are available to U.S. consumers should be safe and meet appropriate standards of quality and consistency. Actions |14.1||The efforts of both the public and private sectors to ensure the development, validation, and dissemination of analytical methods and reference materials for dietary supplements should be accelerated.| |14.2||The proposed Good Manufacturing Practices for Dietary Supplements should be published expeditiously, followed by a timely review of comments and completion of a final rule. The Food and Drug Administration should be provided with adequate resources to complete this task. [GMPs deal mainly with the technicalities of manufacturing and the cleanliness of manufacturing and storage facilities. They are not a substitute for ensuring that the health claims for such products are legitimate. Worthless or dangerous products prepared according to GMPs are still worthless or dangerous.]| |14.3||Adequate funding should be provided to appropriate Federal agencies, including U.S. Customs and Food and Drug Administration inspection authorities, to enforce current laws monitoring the quality of imported raw materials and finished products intended for use as dietary supplements. [The FDA already has the legislative tools to do this, but many other tasks compete for attention from its limited resources.]| |14.4||Manufacturers should have on file and make available to the FDA upon request scientific information to substantiate their determinations of safety, and current statutory provisions should be periodically reexamined to determine whether safety requirements for dietary supplements are adequate. [Manufacturers are already required to have information available to the FDA, but it is obvious that current laws do not protect the public. The only way to protect the public is to require proof of safety and effectiveness before marketing.]| |14.5||An objective process for evaluating the safety of dietary supplement products should be developed by an independent expert panel. [It is not possible to evaluate safety without considering effectiveness.]| Availability of Accurate Information on Potential Benefits, Risks, and Appropriate Use of Dietary Supplements and Other CAM Products The regulation of products such as foods, drugs, vitamins, minerals, and botanicals is determined by the intended use of the product, and the label must conform to the laws and regulations governing the product's intended use. Thus, the same product can be marketed as a prescription drug, dietary supplement, or food, depending on the manufacturer's statements regarding the product's intended use. Any product that claims to diagnose, prevent, mitigate, treat, or cure a disorder must be approved as a drug by the FDA; otherwise, such claims cannot be included on the label. Statements that a nutrient will reduce the risk of disease, such as \"diets high in calcium may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" or \"diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure\" are known as health claims and must be approved under the provisions of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. This act applies to dietary supplements as well as conventional foods and it allows health claims to be made only after extensive FDA review of the scientific literature, using the \"significant scientific agreement\" standard to determine that the nutrient-disease relationship is well established. Recent Federal legislation allows a product to claim a health benefit if the manufacturer provides evidence of an \"authoritative statement\" from a Federal agency or scientific organization such as the National Academy of Sciences. However, claims about treating, preventing, curing, or mitigating diseases are reserved only for drugs. Dietary supplements may make claims related to structure and function of the body, such as \"improves immune function,\" or make no claim at all on the label. [No dietary supplement product \"improves immune function,\" and nearly all \"structure-function claims are misleading because they are incomplete. Since nutrients have many biocehnical and physiologic functions, it is truthful to state that nutrient A can \"support\" function B. However, if a person's diet is adequate with respect to nutrient A, taking a supplement is a waste of money. Therefore, to avoid being misleading, stucture-function claims must disclose the likelihood of benefit (which, for many nutrients, is very small).] Not having to undergo approval as drugs has greatly increased the accessibility of dietary supplements to the public, yet it has limited the availability of label information on potential risks, benefits, and appropriate use. For example, because it is distributed as a dietary supplement, glucosamine sulfate (2-amino-2-deoxyglucose), which has been shown in numerous scientific studies published in peer-reviewed journals to be effective in treating osteoarthritis [19], can claim only that it helps to maintain joint health. Likewise, numerous scientific studies, a monograph by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, and a meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association show that Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) is an effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia [20]. This information cannot be included on the label because dietary supplements are limited to structure-function claims. [This situation is relevant to only a small percentage of supplement and herbal ingredients.] Manufacturers of products such as these have no incentive to petition the FDA for a health or drug claim because the products are not patentable and the manufacturers are therefore unlikely to recover the cost of additional research to support the claim. This situation also acts as a deterrent to investment in research on risks, benefits, and appropriate conditions of use. Yet, even when such information is known, manufacturers are limited by current regulations as to what they can claim. When information about substantial, documented risks does becomes available, as in the case of the potential interaction between St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) and certain prescription drugs [2]1, it should be included on the label of both the prescription drug and the dietary supplement. Labels should provide information about significant interactions with prescription or over-the-counter drugs, foods, or other health products, as well as information about likely, significant risks to vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, pregnant or nursing women, and those with certain health conditions or compromised immune systems. [That is true, but it is an argument for requiring manufacturers to meet the standards for drug approval.] Under current law, which holds the manufacturer responsible for ensuring the safety of products before marketing, the provision of such information is primarily the responsibility of the manufacturer. As with labeling for all products covered by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, dietary supplement labels must include all facts that are material in light of consequences (such as potential risks and interactions) that may result from use of the product or representations made about it [22]. However, some manufacturers believe that insufficient scientific evidence is a justification for not informing the FDA of a potential problem. Greater emphasis should be placed on this important responsibility of manufacturers. [Manufacturers should be required to report adverse effects.] The public expects that products sold in the United States have been deemed safe. Most people are unaware of the complexities and implications of existing regulatory guidelines or recent court decisions that have upheld the right of commercial free speech in the advertising and labeling of dietary supplements. Since many dietary supplements are purchased without the knowledge or advice of an appropriately trained and credentialed provider, information on benefits, appropriate use, and potential risks should be made easily available to consumers at the time of purchase. [This falsely assumes that manufacturers would be willing to provide information that is accurate and complete and that the FDA has sufficient resources to ensure the validity of the information. If the U.S. Congress wants to protect consumers, it much repeal DSHEA and give the FDA much stronger enforcement tools.] Although product labeling is of primary importance, labels have only limited space for information. Other options such as package inserts and point-of-sale information should be considered to ensure that consumers receive all pertinent information. Some imported products have labels with information in a language other than English. Current regulations requiring information on labels to be in English should be enforced. This does not preclude another language from being used also, but it does ensure that the majority of consumers, providers, and regulators can understand the information. Because the use of dietary supplements has grown so dramatically since the enactment of DSHEA, Federal and State regulatory agencies need more well-trained, highly skilled professionals with expertise in dietary supplements to safeguard the public. [Increasing expertise would not help unles the FDA has adequate regulatory tools, which it does not.] Expert staff are needed, particularly in the rapidly evolving area of botanicals, to help develop mutually supportive relationships between regulatory agencies and industry, thus engendering consumer confidence. Providing accurate information to consumers on CAM products is a complex technical, legal, and regulatory matter that requires ongoing participation by and consultation with the public. Recommendation 15: Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as modified by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, should be fully implemented, funded, enforced, and evaluated. Actions |15.1||The Food and Drug Administration and other agencies with regulatory responsibilities should be provided with additional resources to 1) enforce the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act's regulations regarding labeling of dietary supplements, 2) enforce current provisions requiring that dietary supplements be labeled in English, even if the same information is also included in another language, and 3) employ additional professionals with expertise in dietary supplements. [It is difficult to understand, in practical terms, what such \"additional resources\" would accomplish. It would be far more effective to demand that products be proven safe and effective before they are marketed.]| |15.2||Current provisions requiring disclosure of material facts by manufacturers of CAM products should be enforced, and manufacturers should meet their responsibility to disclose material facts on the label, package, and/or package insert, so that the public will have information about known risks and well-documented significant interactions. Information on potential benefits of dietary supplements should also be made easily available at the time of purchase. [Current drug laws require that products marketed for the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of disease be labeled with adequate directions for their intended uses. If dietary supplements (and herbs) had to meet this standard, the industry would collapse.]| |15.3||Congress should periodically evaluate the effectiveness, limitations, and enforcement of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, including its impact on public health, and take appropriate action to ensure the public's safety. [The impact is obvious: since its passage, the marketplace has been flooded with unsubstantiated claims for dietary supplements and herbs. The only appropriate action would be to repeal the law.]| Advertising of Dietary Supplements and Other CAM Practices and Products The FTC is responsible for ensuring that advertising is truthful, not misleading, and substantiated so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products being marketed. The FTC does this by enforcing laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in print and broadcast advertisements (including the Internet), catalogs, and similar direct-marketing materials. Since the passage of DSHEA, the FTC has placed increased emphasis on monitoring the advertising of dietary supplements. More than 1,500 businesses in the United States manufacture dietary supplements [23] and an estimated $700 million was spent by these companies in 2000 to advertise their products on television and in print [24]. Almost $192 billion was spent on direct marketing of all health care products in 2000, including mail, catalogs, teleservices, and the Internet. This marketing is estimated to have generated $1.7 trillion in sales [25]. To help the dietary supplement industry conform to its standards of truthful and not misleading advertising, the FTC has produced a guide that provides detailed explanations and descriptions of acceptable statements [26]. Still, abuses have been identified, particularly on the Internet and in direct-mail advertising materials. Deceptive advertising by this small segment of the industry can not only hurt consumers, but also cause manufacturers and distributors that comply with current anti-deception and substantiation standards to lose market share and suffer financially. Deceptive advertising comes in many forms. Some advertisements promise to treat or cure a disease or condition without scientific backing for the claim. Others claim to slow or reverse the aging process and increase longevity, energy, memory, and sexual function. Although some products may be beneficial for such conditions, others have no effect. In some cases, these products cause serious unintended effects, ranging from the consequences of delayed treatment to interactions with prescription drugs to increased risk of developing other conditions. A recent Government Accounting Office (GAO) report and Senate hearing [27] highlighted the potential for physical and economic harm posed by certain dietary supplements marketed and advertised as anti-aging therapies. In addition to the potential medical consequences of these supplements, the GAO reports, 20 companies marketing the products have been targeted by law enforcement agencies and have cost consumers approximately $36 million [28]. Because of the proliferation of health fraud on the Internet, the FTC has established Operation Cure.all, an ongoing project specifically targeting deceptive health marketing claims. Although Operation Cure.all is not aimed specifically at CAM- related sites, many of the fraudulent claims uncovered by the program are for CAM products and services to cure cancer, AIDS, and other chronic diseases. Although the FTC has identified hundreds of Internet sites with questionable or clearly fraudulent health claims and has sent out e-mail advisories to more than 500 of them, the agency has brought formal action against only16 since 1997. In addition to the Internet cases, the FTC has brought 40 enforcement actions since 1997 against companies for deceptive marketing of dietary supplements in other media, including radio, television, newspapers, magazines and direct mail. The advertising challenged by the FTC promoted products for such conditions as attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, colds and allergies, impotence, diabetes, vascular diseases, and obesity. Current FTC efforts should be significantly expanded to decrease the amount of false or deceptive advertising, to solicit public comments on CAM advertising, and to expand the use of CAM experts in the process of examining advertisements. [To increase FTC efforts, Congress would have to increase its budget so it can afford to hire more staff. No \"CAM\" expertise is needed to deterine whether advertising is false. The FTC can easily do this by asking sellers for substantiation and subjecting what is submitted to review by mainstream experts.] ] Recommendation 16: Activities to ensure that advertising of dietary supplements and other CAM practices and products is truthful and not misleading should be increased. |16.1||Congress should provide additional support to the Federal Trade Commission to 1) expand efforts to identify false and deceptive advertising of CAM-related health services and products and take appropriate enforcement action when necessary, 2) use appropriate CAM experts in the process of examination of CAM-related advertising, 3) increase activities to help consumers distinguish useful and reliable information from deceptive and unsubstantiated advertising in all forms of marketing and advertising, including at the point of purchase; and 4) seek additional public comment on the benefits and potential problems in the advertising of CAM-related services and products. [This is an excellent recommendation. However, although stronger federal action could drive many CAM entrepreneurs out of business, the U.S. Congress is dominated by CAM advocates who have seriously weakened consumer protection during the past decade. If WHCCAMP really wants more protection for consumers, it should advocate repealing the 1994 Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act which severely weakened FDA enforcement powers. And it should also oppose CAM advocates' efforts to weaken FTC enforcement in the same way.]| Collection and Dissemination of Information on Adverse Events Stemming from the Use of Dietary Supplements Most dietary supplements are likely to be safe for human consumption, yet, as with any biologically active substance, adverse events can and do occur. The rigorous pre-market testing and review process required for pharmaceuticals is not required for dietary supplements. Therefore, monitoring of adverse events after supplements reach the market is critical to understanding their effects and interactions and to responding quickly when problems do occur. The FDA uses the Adverse Events Reporting system to identify emerging problems with specific products and general trends in illness and death related to dietary supplements. However, reporting is voluntary \u2014 manufacturers and distributors are not required to notify the FDA of adverse reactions that are reported to them. In April 2001, the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report calling adverse event reporting for dietary supplements \"an inadequate safety valve\" [29]. The report identifies the limitations of the Adverse Events Reporting system in detecting serious adverse events and recommends ways of improving it. Serious adverse events (as defined under Medwatch and the FDA's Standard Operating Procedures of 1999) related to dietary supplements need to be identified and, when necessary, contained in a timely manner to prevent unnecessary illness and death. Since manufacturers are not required to register themselves or their supplements with the FDA before producing or selling them, a potentially dangerous situation could be extremely difficult to contain. [The best solution to this problem should be to require proof of safety and effectiveness before they are marketed.] Manufacturers and suppliers should be required to register their products with the FDA so that the agency can quickly notify other manufacturers and suppliers and the public when a serious adverse event occurs. In addition, information from poison control centers needs to be linked with the Adverse Events Reporting system. Recommendation 17: The collection and dissemination of information about adverse events stemming from the use of dietary supplements should be improved. Actions |17.1||Congress should require dietary supplement manufacturers and suppliers to register with the Food and Drug Administration, and the agency should encourage voluntary registration until such a requirement is in effect, so that manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers can be promptly notified if a serious adverse event is identified. [This is one of the few valid ideas in the WHCCAMP report.]| |17.2||Recent congressional support for improving the Food and Drug Administration's adverse events reporting system should be enhanced by requiring dietary supplement manufacturers and suppliers to maintain records and report serious adverse events to the agency. [This is one of the few valid ideas in the WHCCAMP report.]| |17.3||Additional resources and support should be provided to 1) the Food and Drug Administration to simplify the adverse events reporting system for dietary supplements, and to streamline the database for timely review and follow-up on received reports; and 2) the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other appropriate Federal agencies to increase outreach activities to consumers, health professionals (including poison control centers, emergency room physicians, CAM practitioners, and mid-level marketers) in order to improve both manufacturers' and the public's awareness of and participation in voluntary event reporting. [This might be useful, but it would be more efficient to require that products be proven safe and effective before marketing.]| References - Coen Robert, The Insider's Report, Universal McCann, Dec 3, 2001. http://www.mccann.com/insight/bobcoen.html. - U.S. Dietary Supplements Market Size Expressed as Dollar Sales by Top Six Product Categories for 1994 to 1998 and Forecast for 1999 and 2000, National Business Journal, 2000, Dialog file No. 93, San Francisco: The Dialog Corporation, 2000. - Survey of Consumer Use of Dietary Supplements, Prevention Magazine.

Gorski, MD, FACOG]In Town Hall meetings across the country during the past two years, people voiced a number of concerns about access of the public to Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) practitioners and products. Issues raised include access to qualified CAM practitioners, state regulation of CAM practitioners, integration of CAM and conventional health care, collaboration between CAM and conventional practitioners, and the cost of CAM services. Many people who testified, including those who have only limited access to \"basic health care,\" expressed a desire for increased access to safe and effective CAM, along with conventional services. As is true for conventional health care, many factors influence access to CAM services and their delivery. The distribution and availability of local providers, regulation and credentialing of providers, policies concerning coverage and reimbursement, and characteristics of the health care delivery system all affect the quality and availability of care and consumer satisfaction. Equally important, access is limited by income, since most CAM practices and products are not covered under public or private health insurance programs. As with conventional care, access to CAM is more problematic for rural, uninsured, underinsured, and other special populations. The issue of access is further compounded by lack of scientific evidence regarding safety and effectiveness of many CAM practices and products. [Thereb is no reason to be concerned about access limitations unless practices and products have been proven to be safe and effective.] A better understanding of how the public uses CAM is needed in order to determine what can be done to improve access to safe and effective CAM within the context of other public health and medical needs. In addition, more information is needed on what constitutes \"appropriate access\" to CAM services. [This falsely implies that there are many safe and effective \"CAM methods\" and that more access to them is needed and that access to them should be increased.] Most CAM practices have developed independently of the conventional health care system and are not uniformly regulated by the states or the Federal government. A variety of market mechanisms and other arrangements have developed to pay for these services, including out-of-pocket payments, discounted fees, insurance reimbursement, and donated services. Where the public has had access to CAM services it has often been with little assurance of safety, quality, or efficacy. [That is correct. It is not possible to \"assure efficacy\" without scientific data that something works.] Moreover, because most consumers have had to pay for CAM services directly, access often has been limited to those with higher discretionary income [1] An overview of insurance coverage and reimbursement for CAM is presented in Chapter 7. As interest in CAM grows and as CAM increasingly enters the mainstream of American health care, mechanisms that worked in the past to help ensure safety and quality may no longer be adequate. For example, if CAM practices become eligible for reimbursement through the health insurance system, issues that now confront the conventional health care system \u2014 including safety, fraud, and practitioner malpractice or incompetence \u2014 will need to be addressed for CAM. In addition, if private health insurance reimbursement for CAM services increases, questions of equity arise for beneficiaries of Federal \u2014 and state- sponsored health care programs, the underinsured, and uninsured. [This passage has things backward. Issued of \"safety, fraud, and practitioner malpractice or incompetence\" should be resolved before methods are covered, not afterward.] Some people believe that existing practice structures have worked well for those who use CAM and that no further action is required. But market demand for CAM is already reshaping the dynamics of health care delivery, requiring that some issues be addressed. For example, insurers and managed care plans are offering CAM options more frequently, and integrated medical clinics and private practices are spreading. [It is unclear whether the \"shaping\" is the result of market demand or by the wishful thinking of executives who think that offering \"CAM\" services will make them more marketable.] As more evidence is published on the safety and effectiveness of CAM practices, they are more likely to be incorporated into health care treatment protocols. [How can the Commission possibly know whether research will cause them to be more accepted or less accepted?] Now is the time to look at policy options for the future and to design strategies for addressing potential issues of access and safety. Beyond these basic concerns, protecting the public, maintaining free competition in the provision of CAM services, and maintaining the consumer's freedom to choose appropriate health professionals are issues to be considered when developing strategies and policies. [Consumers are free to choose whatever they want as long as they pay for it themselves.] Moreover, the need to maintain CAM styles of practice, rather than allowing them to be subsumed into the conventional medical model, also must be considered when addressing these issues. [The Commission does not define \"CAM styles of practice\" but implies that they are superior to conventional styles.] If approached with both imagination and caution, the policy planning process could not only address these issues more effectively, but also a broader set of health issues affecting the nation, such as whether access to safe and effective CAM services can: - Benefit vulnerable populations including those with chronic diseases, the terminally ill, and other populations with special needs; - Lower health care costs and possibly increase access to conventional health care services for some segments of the population, such as the chronically and terminally ill; and, - Help solve issues of equity and quality that do not set up a zero-sum struggle over limited resources. The present state of evidence concerning the safety and effectiveness of various CAM practices precludes any final assessment of their contributions to and limitations in addressing these broader health issues. The process of gathering evidence is on-going, however, and as evidence increases concerning ways that various CAM approaches do or do not affect health, processes of living and dying, and costs for other care, access to and delivery of some CAM practices and services are likely to become more pressing public policy issues. [This falsely assumes that research will eventually demonstrate that many \"CAM\" practices are beneficial. As usual, the Commission does not consider the fact that research could also demonstrate that they don't work.] Meanwhile, public interest in CAM, and the market dynamics that have evolved in response to it, have brought issues of access to the forefront. Policy-makers should begin to address these issues and examine the implications of different kinds of policy for consumers and practitioners, for clinics, hospitals and other organizational settings where health care is now delivered, and for the system as a whole. [This puts the cart before the horse. Before considering whether additional access is needed, there must be evidence that something works.] CAM Practitioners and Public Safety The public has expressed interest in maintaining easy access to CAM practitioners and in having sufficient information about them to make informed choices. [The public also favors motherhood and apple pie.] Perceptions of the relative importance of being able to take responsibility for one's own health and health decisions, yet be protected from incompetent practitioners, underlie differences in consumers' response to possible state or Federal regulation of CAM. Public sentiment on the need for and degree of regulation ranges, with some calling for more regulation of CAM, to others who are opposed to any regulation. The Commission recognizes that Americans want to be able to choose from both conventional and CAM practices and that they want assurances that practitioners are qualified. [There is an inherent conflict between freedom to choose and the need ro be protected.] CAM practitioners have raised additional issues that are important to the public because they affect freedom of access to CAM providers. Some health care practitioners, both CAM and conventional, are concerned about liability and prosecution if the services they provide are not commonly accepted within conventional medical practice. Another concern of some CAM professionals is that they are licensed to practice in some states but not others, and that even where licensed, their scope of practice may vary across the country. [The extent to which unqualified pracitioners can practice depends on their ability to persaude state legislators to legalize what they do.] While some CAM professions endorse licensure requirements in order to participate fully in the health care delivery system, several people testified that licensure is not feasible for some categories of CAM practitioners, such as Native American and other traditional healers. Some CAM practitioners consider their disciplines to be educational (Alexander Technique) or spiritual (Reiki) and have expressed concerns about being licensed as health professionals. Some conventional health care practitioners who incorporate CAM modalities into their practices want to broaden the scope of practice laws to allow these modalities to be used. Establishing legal authority to practice requires states to establish standards of practice, including training, education and continuing education requirements, as well as scope of practice. Some CAM professionals believe that to reorganize CAM on the conventional professional model, with the kind of licensure, registration, or exemption procedures that this implies, will damage the fundamental character of much of CAM. Some believe that in the past, legislation to \"protect the public\" was often used to restrict competition in the provision of services. Five important issues of access and delivery concern both the public and practitioners: - Protecting the public from the inappropriate practice of health care, - Providing opportunities for appropriately trained and qualified health practitioners to offer the full range of services in which they are trained and competent, - Maintaining competition in the provision of CAM and other health services, - Preserving CAM styles and traditions that have been valued by both practitioners and consumers, and - Determining the extent of the public's choice among health care modalities. If addressed separately, these concerns can lead to very different public policies, and state legislation that affects access to CAM practices varies in its emphasis on these concerns. Therefore, when developing strategies to address problems of access to CAM practitioners, all of these criteria should be considered. Evaluating State Approaches Legislative and regulatory policies that affect conventional and CAM practitioners fall largely under the aegis of state governments, primarily through regulation of practice. In recent years, a few states have passed legislation and enacted regulations that affect access to CAM practitioners. These regulations provide a natural experiment for solutions to access and delivery of CAM. If properly documented and evaluated, these ventures could provide information that may guide other states and the Federal government in future policy development. [True, but the history of such boards suggests that they do almost nothing to protect the public.] Minnesota provides almost unlimited freedom to practice. Unlicensed practitioners must inform clients of their education, experience, and intended treatments, as well as possible side effects or known risks of the treatments. Clients must sign an informed consent statement acknowledging the practitioner is unlicensed, that complaints may be filed with the Minnesota Department of Health if treatment is unsatisfactory, and that they have the right to seek licensed care at any time. Requirements for practice are minimal, but practitioners are not exempted from liability for untoward outcomes. Licensed health professionals also may provide CAM services, as long as their provision of the services is consistent with regulations governing their licensure. In short, the Minnesota law preserves maximum freedom for CAM practitioners and consumers and relies primarily upon informed consent for protection of health care consumers. In contrast, Washington provides licensure, registration, or exemption for various categories of CAM professionals, based on their education and the extent to which their profession prepares practitioners to assume responsibility for the total health care of clients. Regulations delineate standards of practice, the scope of practice allowable, education and training requirements for licensure, registration, or exemption, and required professional oversight. Four CAM professional groups (naturopathic physicians, acupuncturists, massage therapists, and chiropractors) are licensed and regulated. The emphasis in Minnesota is placed on granting all CAM professionals the freedom to practice with minimal restrictions, while holding them accountable for outcomes. The Washington law emphasizes licensure as the route to protecting consumers and the practice rights of some CAM professionals. The Minnesota law preserves the range of CAM practices without distinguishing among them, whereas the Washington law requires CAM practitioners to fit into a professional model in order to receive the rights and responsibilities granted conventional health care professions. [Neither approach offers much public protection because irrational practices are so deeply ingrained in these practices that the boards are rarely inclined to attempt to stop them.] Other states vary considerably in their regulatory approaches to licensure and scope of practice. For example, chiropractors are licensed in all states, while acupuncturists, massage therapists, and naturopathic physicians are licensed in 40, 30, and 11 states, respectively. (Table 1 shows the distribution of CAM specialties by state.) These variations affect access to and delivery of CAM by limiting practitioners' ability to practice lawfully and to obtain malpractice insurance. On the Federal level, several bills have been introduced into recent sessions of Congress that could affect access to CAM, including some that allow greater latitude for unconventional treatments. Any Federal legislation drafted in the future should consider the experience states are acquiring through their various legislative initiatives. A number of factors should be studied when evaluating state models of creating access and delivery and protecting the public. Health services research should document how different legal frameworks affect access to CAM and how this different access affects health outcomes. Other issues to be considered include how state regulations affect the supply and distribution of various CAM practices and practitioners over time, as well as competition and costs of services. Also important are the effects of different regulatory models on the safety of the population, problems that may arise from use of different models, and the impact on conventional health care practitioners. Changes in the amount of time and quality of interaction with consumers of CAM services might also be assessed through periodic surveys. [It is unclear how a survey could be used to evaluate quality of care. Consumer satisfaction can be surveyed, but that is not a reliable indicator of quality of care.] As evidence becomes available about the impact each regulatory model is having, the lessons learned can help inform choices that other states and the Federal government will be making. Authority to practice has real impact on access to and delivery of services. The Department of Health and Human Services should gather and assess information about effects of these laws on the public's health as well as on access to CAM and CAM practitioners. Recommendation 18: The Department of Health and Human Services should evaluate current barriers to consumer access to safe and effective CAM practices and to qualified practitioners and should develop strategies for removing those barriers in order to increase access and to ensure accountability. Actions |18.1||The Department of Health and Human Services should assist the States in evaluating the impact of legislation enacted by various States on access to CAM practices and on public safety. [How useful this would be would depends on whether it is done properly.]| |18.2||The Department of Health and Human Services and other appropriate Federal agencies should use health care workforce data, data from national surveys on use of CAM, regional public health reports on CAM activities and other studies to identify current and future health care needs and the relevance of safe and effective CAM services for helping address these needs. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe and effective \"CAM\" activities. No data can identify a \"need\" for \"CAM\" products or services that have not been proven safe and effective.]| Regulatory Frameworks States, in exercising their authority over health care practitioners, should consider where a regulatory infrastructure for CAM practitioners might be necessary in order to promote quality of care and patient safety. The primary mechanisms used by states to regulate health care practitioners are: - Mandatory Licensure, which prohibits the practice of a profession without a license. Licensure denotes a high degree of professional development, including consensus within the profession concerning standards of education, training, and practice, and the ability to self-regulate. - Title Licensure, which permits anyone to practice the modality, but allows only those granted a license to use the title. A demonstrable level of skill or training normally is required for title licensure. - Registration, which is granted in some states to professionals such as dieticians and pharmacists upon completion of required training and exams, is in other states simply a requirement that a provider register his or her name, address, and training with a designated state agency. This type of registration prohibits non-registered individuals from practicing and gives the agency authority to receive consumer complaints and revoke registrations. - Exemption, which accords special status to religious healers. Medical licensing statutes do not apply to these healers, provided they practice within the tenets of a recognized church. State and Federal policy-makers and others with an interest in these issues should recognize three unique challenges that face regulation of CAM practitioners. First, views vary among CAM practitioners regarding how much training should be required for licensure in any given field, the extent to which such training should be required for licensure, and whether and how such education and training can incorporate intuitive skills and individualized approaches to providing health care services. [This falsely assumes that \"CAM\" services are individualized. Many \"CAM\" practitioners treat everyone the same way.] For many CAM providers, licensure presents a tension between the desire to increase standardization of CAM education, training, and practices across states and the desire to keep CAM practice flexible, non-standardized, and linked to subjective, interpersonal and intuitive aspects of care. [What should count is whether they offer valuable services, which most do not.] While increased licensure of CAM may help facilitate research, ease referrals, enhance patient access, and increase consumer protection, it may decrease individualization of services, time spent per patient, and range of patient options, qualities of CAM practice valued by practitioners and patients alike. [This paragraph is absolute baloney. Our laws should be designed to protect people from practitioners who are not qualified to diagnose or treat disease. Most people who offer \"CAM\" services are not qualified to do either.] Second, variation in what constitutes \"CAM\" makes any assessment of CAM as value-added services difficult. Disagreement also surrounds the nature and scope of various CAM professions. [Defining one's scope requires scientific evidence of effectivess.] In 2001, the University of California, San Francisco Center for Health Professions published a report that addresses this issue [2]. Questions it raised include: How does the profession describe itself in terms of the types of care it provides, and the types of care that are beyond its professional scope? Are there differences of opinion within the profession about the range of care that is appropriate for the profession to provide? What interventions and modalities does the profession use? Answers to these questions will help define the various CAM professions. A third, related concern involves the confusion and potential legal consequences that arise from the overlap of approaches and techniques used by CAM practitioners. For example, some states include homeopathy and acupuncture within the definition of the practice scopes for naturopathy or chiropractic, whereas others do not. Practitioners from states with a broad scope of practice who move to states with a more limited one may be unsure whether they risk state censure by providing these services. Confusion and legal risk can occur within a state if the legal authority to practice is not well defined or lacks clarity as to boundaries for practice. The potential for liability creates fear and uncertainty for some CAM practitioners. All providers, CAM and conventional, can be prosecuted if they are considered to have exceeded their scope of practice. [Generally speaking, licensing laws are far too liberal and insufficiently enforced to protect the public against irrational practices.] To address some of these issues the Pew Health Professions Commission, established in 1989, conducted an in-depth study of reform in the regulation of health care practitioners. They recognized that health care workforce reform would necessitate regulatory reform and created a task force to propose new approaches that would better serve the public's interest. In 1995, they published 10 recommendations for regulatory reform and offered policy options, hoping to stimulate debate and discussion by states [3]. The recommendations focus primarily on regulation of conventional health care practitioners but they are applicable to CAM practitioners as well. Recommendations from the Pew Commission Taskforce are in [Appendix B](https://www.quackwatch.org/07PoliticalActivities/WHC/b.html). [Strengthening state regulation of practitioners is a good idea, but if competency standards were uniformly raised, the professions of acupuncture, chiropractic, and naturopathy would be decimated, and no other \"CAM\" practitioners would be permitted to practice independently.] Recommendation 19: The Federal Government should offer assistance to states and professional organizations in 1) developing and evaluating guidelines for practitioner accountability and competence in CAM delivery, including regulation of practice, and 2) periodic review and assessment of the effects of regulations on consumer protection. Actions |19.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should create a policy advisory committee, including CAM and conventional practitioners and representatives of the public, to address issues related to providing access to qualified CAM practitioners, provide guidance to the states concerning regulation possibilities, and provide a forum for dialogue on other issues related to maximizing access. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason in order to develop effective methods of training and qualification, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence or method. Rational methods need no special protection. Irrational methods cannot be made safe by writing guidelines.]| |19.2||The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with states, should assist CAM organizations that wish to develop consensus within their field of practice regarding standards of practice, including education and training. The conclusions reached by CAM professional groups concerning these matters should be considered by states and regulatory bodies in determining the appropriate status of these practitioners for such regulatory options as registration, licensure or exemption. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason to develop practice standards, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence. There can be no objective standards for determining who is a \"qualified CAM practitioner.\" The basic requirement for professional practice should be knowledge of scientifically sound practices. Self-identification or recognition as a \"CAM\" or \"conventional\" professional is irrelevant.]| Recommendation 20: States should evaluate and review their regulation of CAM practitioners and ensure their accountability to the public. States should, as appropriate, implement provisions for licensure, registration, and exemption consistent with the practitioners' education, training, and scope of practice. Actions |20.1||The Department of Health and Human Services' policy advisory committee, in partnership with state legislatures, regulatory boards, and CAM practitioners, should develop model guidelines or other guidance for the regulation and oversight of licensed and registered practitioners who use CAM services and products. This guidance should balance concerns regarding protection of the public from the inappropriate practice of health care, provide opportunities for appropriately trained and qualified health practitioners to offer the full range of services in which they are trained and competent, maintain competition in the provision of CAM and other health services, preserve CAM styles and traditions that have been valued by both practitioners and consumers, and determine the extent of the public's choice among health care modalities. [This falsely assumes that there are many \"appropriately trained and qualified \"CAM\" practitioners and that consumer use is a measure of effectiuveness. Moreover, there is no logical reason why guidelines and standards should depend on whether or not somthing is marketed as \"CAM.\" This recommendation calls for weakening consumer protection against quackery.]| Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Hospice, Community Health Centers, and other Health Care Delivery Organizations Hospitals and Other Conventional Health Care Settings Because of the increased use of CAM, access and safety issues involving delivery of CAM in hospitals, hospices, nursing homes, community health centers, and other health delivery organizations are increasing. Patients sometimes bring CAM products and even CAM practitioners into inpatient settings. Health delivery organizations vary in their policies and procedures regarding such situations, and there is little monitoring of interactions between CAM and conventional health care in these settings. Health care facilities credential practitioners who provide services at their facilities. The question of who may practice and under what conditions within health delivery facilities is not addressed consistently for CAM practitioners. In some facilities, CAM practitioners who are not credentialed are permitted to provide services to patients; in others, only practitioners already credentialed by the facility may provide services. Issues of safety and quality of care also arise when conventional practitioners who are credentialed by a facility use CAM in their practice. An increasing number of physicians use CAM practices for their patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings. One way to address the growing number of issues related to the use of CAM interventions in hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, other clinical settings, and home health care is through the initiatives and leadership of nationally recognized accrediting organizations, including those that accredit health care networks and managed care organizations. For example, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), an independent nonprofit organization, surveys and accredits nearly 18,000 facilities, other health delivery settings, and health plans using professionally based standards to measure compliance. Other nationally recognized accrediting organizations include the National Committee for Quality Assurance and the American Accreditation HealthCare Commission. The efforts of these organizations to address CAM in all health care settings will contribute greatly to the public's safety. In addition, these efforts will assist state and Federal regulators of health delivery organizations and health plans, who often use accreditation as a proxy for government oversight. One important initiative that national accrediting organizations may take is to review their standards, guidelines, and interpretations for areas that affect or are affected by trends in CAM. For instance, one JCAHO standard addresses \"the relationship of the hospital staff and its staff members to other health care providers, educational institutions, and payers.\" In this case, more specific guidance is needed as to how a facility can meet the standard when incorporating CAM interventions into hospital services, serving as a component of an integrated delivery system that includes CAM, or participating in collaborative treatment plans with CAM providers. [Credentialing standards should be the same for everyone. They should not be lowered because they label their practices as \"CAM.\"] The work of national accrediting organizations includes not only a wide range of standards and guidance, but also measurement tools, quality and performance improvement initiatives, and surveys. The work usually is conducted by staff along with representatives of the health care industry, other industry experts, and consumers who serve on various committees and special working groups. It is important for national accrediting organizations to include CAM experts and representatives of CAM organizations on any group that addresses issues related to CAM. [This improperly suggests that only people who consider themselves as \"CAM\" experts are qualified to judge other \"CAM\" practitioners. It also bypasses the issue of whether it is possible to be an expert in a field whose methods have not been proven effective.] Recommendation 21: Nationally recognized accrediting bodies should evaluate how health care organizations under their oversight are using CAM practices and should develop strategies for the safe and appropriate use of qualified CAM practitioners and safe and effective products in these organizations. Actions |21.1||National accrediting bodies, in partnership with other public and private organizations, should evaluate present uses of CAM practitioners in health care delivery settings and develop strategies for their appropriate use in ways that will benefit the public. [This falsely assumes that there are many such uses. It deliberately avoids mention of inappropriate uses and what to do about them.]| |21.2||Nationally recognized accrediting bodies of health care organizations and facilities should consider increasing on-going access to CAM expertise to ensure that processes to develop accreditation standards and interpretations reflect emerging developments in the health care field. [Credentialing standards should be the same for everyone. They should not be lowered because they label their practices as \"CAM.\" This recommendation falsely assumes that \"CAM\" advocates are producing significant new developments.]| |N.||Nationally recognized accrediting bodies, using CAM experts, should review and evaluate current standards and guidelines to ensure the safe use of CAM practices and products in health care delivery organizations. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe \"CAM\" practices and products. As usual, it also fails to call for review intended to exclude unsafe and ineffective modalities.]| Community Health Centers, Hospices, Independent Centers and Other Programs A growing number of Americans use community health centers and other public health programs to meet their health care needs, including help with mental health and substance abuse treatment. These centers and programs often emphasize patient-centered care. A few community health centers have begun to use the services of CAM practitioners such as chiropractors, naturopathic physicians and acupuncturists. These centers might serve as models for the use of CAM practitioners by other community health centers and other public health service programs; however, they need to be evaluated to determine their impact on health care access and cost-benefits. [This appears to assume that close evaluation will be favorable.] Hospice care for the terminally ill is another important model that should be evaluated further. Some hospice programs are beginning to include CAM practitioners on the treatment team. Some of the CAM practices they use are chiropractic, acupuncture, music therapy, meditation, and visualization. In some instances, these services are believed to help reduce anxiety and pain. Some independent CAM centers, which may not have any direct hospital affiliation and may not have a physician on staff, also offer a variety of CAM services. These centers tend to be client-oriented with flexible hours and a broad spectrum of practitioners available. Many of the centers encourage patients to actively improve their health and concentrate on health maintenance rather than disease care and encourage coordination and collaboration among CAM practitioners who are seeing the same patient or client. More information is needed on who uses these centers, their impact on access and delivery, whether appropriate referral procedures are in place, and the quality of care provided. Only when more systematic data are available can the advantages and disadvantages of independent CAM centers be assessed. [This falsely assumes that most of the \"independent CAM centers\" offer appropriate treatment.] Special and Vulnerable Populations Special populations, such as racial and ethnic minorities, and vulnerable populations, such as the chronically and terminally ill, have unique challenges and needs regarding access to CAM. Efforts to address access to CAM need to be balanced with the need for access to conventional health care. Scarce resources need to be carefully allocated so that these populations are not denied opportunities available to others to access safe and effective conventional and CAM services. [This falsely assumes that minority groups and chronically and termianlly ill people are suffering from a lack of access to \"CAM.\" The biggest barrier to \"CAM\" use is not access but lack of scientific evidence of effectiveness.] Increased information on CAM use and barriers to access for these populations is needed. Although some studies have described CAM use among African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans, reliable access and utilization data are largely lacking. In the case of Native Americans, information gathering is limited by their status as sovereign nations. Nonetheless, the Indian Health Service has a program to encourage communication with practitioners of traditional Indian medicine, which will help ensure safety when both Native American and conventional medical systems are used. Surveys of CAM use in the general population indicate that it is being used disproportionately by highly educated, and upper-income Americans [4]. [That's because upper-income Americans have more money that they can afford to waste.] However, early studies used telephone interviews with English speakers, thus providing little information about CAM use among those who do not speak or have limited ability in English, who have lower income, or who lack telephones [5.]. Later studies corrected for these biases, but they did not use adequate statistical sampling to estimate the use of CAM in minority populations [6-11]. Other surveys have focused on low-income and ethnic groups, but these studies frequently had small, unrepresentative samples 12-15]. The National Center for Health Statistics is conducting a nationwide survey on access to and use of CAM among racial and ethnic minorities that is expected to provide statistically reliable estimates of CAM use in these groups. In an October 2000 letter to community health centers and other public health programs, the Health Resources and Services Administration's Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) endorsed the use of CAM in these centers where appropriate [16]. In 2001 they began surveying the use of CAM by persons receiving health services from BPHC-funded community health centers. Information being gathered includes participants' use of six modalities (acupuncture, manual healing, botanicals and herbs, homeopathy, traditional healing, and mind-body techniques); whether the CAM service was provided onsite or by referral, either with or without payment by the community health center; and demographic data. Results should be available in 2002 and will provide a significant, statistically reliable portrait of the use of a variety of CAM services and products by community health center clients, whose come disproportionately from rural, low-income, and minority populations. It is important to continue collecting this kind of information in the future. [Knowing the extent of use will provide no indication of what might be needed, because no data exist to determine whether adding \"CAM\" practices is beneficial and more important than increasing standard practices.] Discussions are currently underway between BPHC and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine to include clients of community health centers in CAM clinical trials, in order to increase the relevance of findings for application to the health needs of minority populations. Use of CAM is especially high among populations with potentially life-threatening diseases. Surveys show that people with cancer use CAM practices and products more frequently than the population as a whole, with CAM most often being used in conjunction with conventional therapies [17-19]. Similarly, there is high use of CAM by people who are terminally ill and their caretakers. Many people in these vulnerable populations are using CAM services regardless of whether they have insurance coverage and sometimes without the knowledge or cooperation of their conventional physician. The chronically and terminally ill consume more health care resources than the rest of the population. Approximately 75 percent of all health care spending in the U.S. currently is for the treatment of chronic disease [20], and 25 percent of Medicare spending is for costs incurred during the last year of life [21]. The great interest in CAM practices among the chronically ill, those with life-threatening conditions, and those at the end of their lives suggests that increased access to some CAM services among these groups could have significant implications for the health care system [This implies that many chronically and terminally ill people would bebefit from availability of unspecified \"CAM\" practices. Health services research, demonstrations, and evaluations are needed to assess whether CAM services can improve care and quality of life for people in these groups, and possibly lessen the use of expensive technological interventions. [Research of this type should not be done unless it appears likely to have a significant practical effect.] With the number of older Americans expected to increase dramatically over the next 20 years, alternative strategies for dealing with end-of-life processes will be increasingly important in public policy. This demographic shift should influence priorities for the kinds of research and demonstration projects that would be carried out in the near future. A more careful assessment of the potential and limitations of CAM approaches in the health care system as a whole might lead to more effective use of resources. For example, Congress could direct the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to develop a demonstration project to study evidence-based CAM interventions as part of comprehensive care of persons with chronic disease in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. [This falsely assumes that such research would find substantia benefit.] The demonstrations would assess health outcomes and total costs of care for beneficiaries in settings where physician leaders are committed to evidence-based medicine, high quality, client-centered care, and openness to CAM approaches. If evaluations show that some uses of CAM can lessen the need for more expensive conventional care in these populations, the economic implications for these Medicare and Medicaid could be significant. [This falsely assumes that this is the likely outome.] If safe and effective CAM practices become more available to the general population, special and vulnerable populations should also have access to these services, along with conventional healthcare. CAM would not be a replacement for conventional health care, but would be part of the options available for treatment. In some cases, CAM practices may be an equal or superior option. [This falsely assumes that safe and effect \"CAM\" practices are abundant.] Evidence for assessing the potential of CAM interventions in treating vulnerable and special populations is still being gathered. While it is too early to judge the effectiveness of CAM in addressing their health care needs, CAM nonetheless offers the possibility of a new paradigm of integrated health care that could affect the affordability, accessibility, and delivery of health care services for millions of Americans. [This paragraph is wishful thinking.] Recommendation 22: The Federal government should facilitate and support the evaluation and implementation of safe and effective CAM practices to help meet the health care needs of special and vulnerable populations. Actions |22.1||The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal Departments should identify models of health care delivery that include safe and effective CAM practices, evaluate them, and then support those models which are successful for use with special and vulnerable populations, including the chronically and terminally ill. [This repeats the false assumtpion that many such \"CAM\" methods exist.]| |22.2||The Department of Health and Human Services should sponsor the development and evaluation of demonstration projects that integrate the use of safe and effective CAM services as part of the health care programs in hospices and community health centers. [This repeats the false assumtpion that many such \"CAM\" methods exist.]| |22.3||The Department of Health and Human Services should identify ways to support the practice of indigenous healing in the United States and to improve communication among indigenous healers, conventional health care professionals, and CAM practitioners. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe and effective indigenous healing practices.]| Table 1.

Gorski, MD, FACOG]The coverage and reimbursement policies of public and private organizations that pay for, provide or insure conventional health care services have played and will continue to play a crucial role in shaping the health care system in this country. Likewise, policies influencing coverage of and reimbursement for non-conventional health care therapies will play an increasingly important role in the future of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), as well as the future structure of the nation's health care system. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" will become increasingly important and deserve greater insurance coverage.] Today, coverage of CAM is evolving in benefit design, type and number of interventions offered, and availability. Consumers and health care providers may use available coverage for a CAM therapy as a principal intervention or as an integral part of the treatment of certain health conditions, such as acupuncture for management of chronic pain. The direction taken by health plan coverage of CAM in the future will shape consumer access to CAM services, the degree of integration of CAM and conventional medicine, and the philosophical foundation of the nation's health care system. [Only a tiny percentage of \"CAM\" methods have garnered coverage, which, in many cases, is limited and available for an extra premium. This falsely implies that many more modalities deserve or will gain coverage in the future.] Although a considerable segment of the U.S. population is uninsured \u2014 a significant public policy issue in itself \u2014 health care coverage is widely available in this country. Recent census data indicate that 86 percent of the population had some type of health insurance during the year [1]. Included in that number are 32 million people (11 percent of the population) covered by Medicare, the federal insurance program for the elderly and for eligible persons who are disabled or who have end-stage renal disease. Other significant sources of health care coverage include private employer and sponsors of benefits, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for Federal employees, State and other public employers, the Department of Defense (DOD) for the military community, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for veterans, and Federal and State programs providing Medicaid and other health coverage for the economically disadvantaged. Researchers estimate that, in 2001, Federal and State programs (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program) accounted for 44 percent of the nation's health expenditures and that insurers and other private sources were responsible for 40 percent [2]* The entities, whether public and private, that pay for or bear most of the cost of coverage are the purchasers of health care. [Coverage of uninsured persons for standard care is vastly more important than increasing coverage for \"CAM\" care, most of which is dubious.] With some exceptions (e.g., fee-for-service Medicare), purchasers obtain health care coverage for their employees or eligible persons by \"buying\" health plans in the private market. Less commonly, purchasers directly contract with, or employ, health care providers. The entities that sell health plan coverage to purchasers are insurance and managed care companies, which include preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and health maintenance organizations (HMOs). These companies undertake all the tasks associated with operating health plans, including marketing, enrollment, paying or operating networks of thousands of providers (physicians, hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, therapists, and so on), and bearing \u2014 or sometime sharing with providers \u2014 most of the financial risk of health care coverage. That is, they shift the potential for financial loss from purchaser to themselves. Even federally sponsored programs such as Medicare, and Federal sponsors such as DOD (for the military, retirees, and dependents), have in place special programs that shift not only delivery of care but financial risk to managed care companies. Some purchasers, including a number of employers, self-insure and assume the risks inherent in providing health care coverage, although these purchasers are the exception rather than the rule. Consumers are sheltered from most of the costs associated with conventional health care, as well as from the risks of future, unknown expenses because purchasers, insurers, and managed care companies shoulder them. In contrast, most fees for CAM services and products are paid by consumers. This direct financial relationship between provider and consumer has the merit of enhancing the consumer's interest and participation in his or her treatment. Furthermore, some CAM practitioners feel that their ability to control fees \u2014 and to avoid time-consuming claims payment and network participation requirements \u2014 enables them to spend more time with clients and to maintain a high level of individualized care. On the other hand, without insurance coverage, access to CAM services is limited by the consumer's ability to pay. Many consumers are unable, or perhaps unwilling, to obtain CAM treatments or to or integrate them into their care because the treatments are not covered under their health plan. [There is no logical reason why taxpayers or policyholders should have to pay for other people's access to unsafe or irrational \"CAM\" products or services.] Coverage of CAM In the last several years, a number of health plans have begun to cover certain CAM services, although the prevalence of this coverage is relatively low, compared to coverage of conventional therapies. Information on this trend is available from an annual survey of employer-sponsored health plans that recently began to include questions regarding a few specific CAM services offered in benefit packages. In 1998, 49 percent of survey respondents indicated that chiropractic was covered; by 2000, the number had risen to 70 per cent. [Most of this is the result of state laws that force insurance companies to cover chiropractic serves whether they want to or not.] Over the same time period, coverage of acupuncture rose from 12 per cent to 17 percent, and coverage of massage therapy increased from 10 percent to 12 percent. The survey also found that large employers (those with more than 20,000 employees) were more likely to offer CAM benefits than medium and smaller employers. PPOs and indemnity insurers were more likely than HMOs to offer health plans that include CAM benefits [3]. Insurance and HMO coverage of CAM will very likely have an impact on use of CAM services. It has been reported that fully covered persons made twice as many visits to chiropractors as individuals with no health plan coverage or those required to pay 25 percent of costs [4]. In a recent survey of over 2,000 households, health insurance coverage was found to be the strongest correlate for frequent use of CAM practitioners [5]. Even where there is health plan coverage, it is often limited. For example, the CAM benefit may cover only one or a few CAM services as the data above indicates. Other limitations include ceilings on the number of visits covered, restrictions on clinical applications, and fixed qualifications for the type of practitioner; for example, ten acupuncture visits might be covered for pain management provided by a medical doctor, and thus would not be covered if provided by a professionally-trained acupuncturist. [These limits are especially important for chiropractors, many of whom recommend weekly or monthly spinal checkups and adjustments throughout life.] Why have employers begun to ask their health insurance and managed care companies to cover CAM benefits? Surveys indicate that they do so primarily in response to employee requests. Other reasons cited in the findings include: 1) attracting and retaining employees, 2) State mandates, and 3) the potential medical benefits of CAM. Although most respondents anticipated increasing their coverage of CAM programs in the future, they cited a number of obstacles to such increases, including inadequate research, regulatory concerns (e.g., licensure), lack of understanding and knowledge about CAM, and lack of data on utilization and costs [6]. A recently published survey of health plans new to offering CAM benefits supports these findings: The plans are offering CAM benefits in response to market research, consumer demand, to attract and retain enrollees, and at the request of purchasers [7]. [Evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectivess appears to have little or no role in what is offered.] At present, CAM is being offered as part of a health plan in several ways, including: - As a rider, or supplement, to the basic benefit package, often with controls on usage, such as copayments, benefit limits (e.g., visit limits, annual limits), or use of an approved network of CAM providers. - As a discount program whereby covered employees (or members) pay out-of-pocket but are eligible for discounts off professional CAM fees and CAM products (discounted fees are usually tied to an approved network of CAM practitioners). - As a defined, core benefit. This benefit is managed by limiting the type of CAM services covered (e.g., only chiropractic, or only chiropractic and acupuncture), requiring a preauthorization or a referral by a primary care physician, or setting visit or dollar limits and higher co-payments than for routine physician visits. - As a CAM benefit account, typically an annual dollar amount. Employers also may offer prevention, wellness, or health promotion programs, on-site or off-site. These typically include smoking cessation, weight control, stress reduction, yoga, health club memberships, and other special programs. More recently, employers have become interested in educational programs to help employees with chronic diseases manage their conditions. Employers who have introduced such programs do so to decrease absenteeism, improve productivity and morale, and achieve some cost savings. Like health benefit coverage, employer-based programs to promote health are often limited in scope and restricted to certain modalities. [There is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" help employees with chronic disease.] Overcoming Barriers to Coverage of Safe and Effective CAM Health care interventions known to be safe and beneficial should be reviewed and considered for coverage under health benefit programs, regardless of whether the interventions are considered conventional medicine or CAM. Such consideration has not occurred often for CAM interventions, and may continue to occur infrequently because of numerous barriers inherent in the health care industry. [The big barrier, of course, is that insurance companies prefer to cover practices that they regard as safe and effective, and very few products or procedures markets as \"CAM\" have been substantiated.] The Commission believes that these barriers to coverage and reimbursement of CAM should be addressed. Doing so does not imply that CAM should be treated differently from conventional medicine \u2014 on the contrary, CAM should be held to the same standards as conventional medicine. [This passage falsely suggests that if insurance companies would loook more closely, they would find many \"CAM\" practices to be worth covering. Curiously, the Commission does not list what it thinks deserves to be covered. Perhaps they are afraid that the list would be so short that their charade would be unmasked.] The fundamental barriers to coverage and reimbursement identified by the Commission are addressed in the remainder of this chapter. They are clustered into two broad issue areas that must be addressed as purchasers, insurers, managed care organizations, Federal agencies, States, and others respond to consumers' increasing use of CAM interventions. The first area involves the need for health services research to test the benefits and cost-effectiveness of CAM interventions, and to effectively communicate the findings. The second area is the need for equivalent and impartial consideration of safe, effective CAM interventions, especially in developing coverage policy. Testing the Benefits and Cost-Effectiveness of CAM Services and Products, and Communicating the Findings Effectiveness of CAM Therapies A growing body of evidence shows that many CAM interventions are effective in treating or helping to treat a range of health conditions. However, insurance and managed care executives have indicated to the Commission that CAM services and products are not covered, or receive limited coverage, because there is not enough evidence of \"medical effectiveness.\" [8-10] Understandably, decision-makers for organizations that purchase health plans or for the health plans themselves are concerned that their limited dollars be spent on care that has been shown to be safe and efficacious. In the face of ever-rising health care costs and the vicissitudes of the economy, purchasers and payers also want value and accountability for their investment. The addition of State-mandated benefits, as well as the constant stream of new technologies, drugs, and treatment protocols, has left these parties cautious about expanding any health care benefits. At the operational level, government agencies like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), insurers, and managed care organizations invest significant time and resources to determine which benefits are covered, for how long, which practitioners are authorized to perform the services, and how payment will be made. Except for chiropractic and, increasingly, acupuncture and massage therapy, much of CAM is not covered. The services that are covered are often accompanied by limitations, such as global visit limits that are unrelated to individual patient needs or course of treatment. With the rising cost of health care and heightened sensitivity to price in the market place, the addition of new benefits is a major undertaking. Taken together, economic and market forces, as well as pressures to manage the use of services in today's health insurance world, are creating the need for more evidence of the clinical effectiveness of CAM interventions. Evidence of clinical effectiveness in the treatment of illnesses and injuries will form the basis for sound coverage and reimbursement policies for CAM. The Commission strongly supports more health services research to establish the medical and clinical efficacy of CAM therapies. Because research dollars are limited, cooperative efforts between the public and private sectors are needed to identify and resolve methodological issues that challenge health services research and to establish research priorities. In addition to research on safety and efficacy, health services research is needed to evaluate the outcomes of CAM interventions in improving health status, treating acute and chronic conditions such as with heart disease, diabetes, and HIV infection, and supporting the care of persons with life-threatening diseases such as cancer. Research and demonstrations are needed to develop and test models of providing CAM (including integrative and collaborative programs), to compare conventional and CAM approaches for the same condition, to test the effectiveness of individual and combined CAM interventions, to test CAM offered in conjunction with conventional therapies, and to conduct population-based studies. Likewise, research is needed on whether CAM, health promotion programs, and prevention efforts increase worker morale, reduce stress, lessen the incidence of workplace disabilities and workmen's compensation claims, shorten treatment duration for illness and injuries, and improve productivity. To maximize resources, vested parties should be brought together to develop a comprehensive, cohesive agenda. The parties would, at a minimum, identify priority questions for research and demonstrations, issues in applying common research methodologies, data needs, and ways in which the public and private sectors could coordinate their efforts. The parties will need to commit to carrying out this agenda and invest financial resources to build the needed research base. Participants should include the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), including the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), CMS, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), DOD, VA, private research and other foundations, health industry associations, medical associations and experts, CAM associations and experts, and representatives for employers, States, and consumers. Cost Effectiveness and CAM Public pressure to make CAM more accessible is increasing, yet without adequate information on the use, costs and overall cost-effectiveness of CAM benefits, lawmakers, health plans, and employers are ill-equipped to make decisions about offering CAM services. Costs and cost-effectiveness of health care interventions are important factors in any consideration of changes in coverage. There is growing evidence of cost-savings from CAM interventions, such as massage therapy and the use of mind-body medicine in a variety of clinical situations [12]. For example, researchers in two randomized trials found that pre-term babies who received massage and comforting touch had greater weight gain and were discharged earlier than babies who did not receive this care. Hospital stays were shortened by 5 to 6 days, and savings averaged more than $10,000 per infant [13]. While research like this is encouraging, further evidence needs to be gathered regarding CAM interventions, especially those that are widely used by consumers or where clinical and cost effectiveness is promising. More information is needed on the cost-effectiveness of specific CAM interventions for various conditions, different models of CAM practice, the clinical and financial impact of integrating CAM with conventional medicine, and the relative costs of CAM treatments and conventional medical treatments. Information is also needed regarding whether CAM interventions reduce the use of conventional medical services and pharmaceuticals by people with heart disease, cancer, chronic pain, or other chronic illnesses, as well as by the terminally ill. The short- and long-term costs and benefits of wellness programs and self-care need to be studied, as does the impact of CAM practices on the short- and long-term health status of men, women, and children. Likewise, employers and other purchasers need to know more about the impact of CAM and health promotion programs on workplace costs, including productivity, workmen's compensation and disability costs, and recruitment and retention. Finally, Congress, the Executive Branch, and decision makers in both the public and private sectors need information about the impact of CAM on patterns and costs of health care in the United States. The information needed by purchasers, insurers, and managed care organizations can be obtained only through health services research, demonstrations, and evaluations in the areas of cost, cost-benefit, and cost-effectiveness of CAM practices and products. These studies, which ideally should stem from the research agenda discussed earlier, will require the support of the Federal government, States, employers, private research organizations, the insurance and managed care industries, and other entities. Participants in building cost-effectiveness research are the same as those identified above for research into the clinical effectiveness of CAM. Cost is not always a threshold for coverage. Health plans cover a number of costly conventional medical interventions, including heart and lung transplants. The Commission believes that the cost of CAM services and products should not in itself pose a barrier to coverage. Rather, cost should be approached in the same manner as the costs of conventional interventions. Coding for CAM Interventions On an operational level, insurers and managed care organizations need data bases to design health benefit plans, set premiums, conduct actuarial analyses, perform quality-of-care studies, manage provider networks, and manage the costs and use of health services. Policy makers and health researchers need data bases to conduct the clinical and health services research in which public policy and programs are grounded. Much of the data used by health plans, researchers, and policy makers are drawn from claim, or transaction, forms, such as the CMS/HCFA 1500 or the UB-92. A number of the information fields on claim forms are assigned standardized, nationally accepted codes for data management purposes. The use of such codes has helped create powerful data bases that drive much of health care. Standard coding has become even more critical now that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is implementing administrative requirements stemming from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). These requirements impact heavily on the electronic filing of claims; in particular, the act contains a provision that fines practitioners and insurance companies up to $10,000 per code for incorrectly submitting and processing claims. Practitioners are charged for miscoding, and insurance companies are fined for paying fraudulent claims. Government agencies, insurance companies and managed care organizations use uniform coding systems \u2014 such as the International Classification of Disease to denote diagnosis, Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) to denote medical procedures, dental codes for dentistry, national drug codes for prescriptions, and the CMS/HCFA Common Procedure Coding System for supply items and some procedures \u2014 as part of the electronic record of information about items and services used. Because coding has evolved along with conventional health care, including reimbursement trends, these systems have limited capability to capture CAM practices and products. For example, CPT codes, a set of more than 8,000 procedure codes developed by the American Medical Association for use throughout conventional health care, provides for a few CAM services including two codes for acupuncture. More recently, a coding system for CAM procedures, services and products (as well as nursing services) has been developed and is being used in a number of settings. This system, ABCcodes developed by Alternative Link, contains 4,000 codes and captures a large amount of detail regarding specific CAM interventions. For example, it has 37 codes reflecting acupuncture services. Currently, there is some variation regarding which coding system is used in CAM practice settings. Some practitioners use CPT, some use ABCcodes, and some use both. As part of their reimbursement policies, insurance companies may require the use of CPT codes. There is concern that the use of conventional coding systems, such as CPT, in limits the data that can be generated for CAM interventions. If not resolved, limited coding capability will present a barrier to health services research on the safety, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of CAM interventions, as well as on the efficiency of models of integration and collaboration, where claims data are needed by researchers. In addition, the absence of nationally recognized, standardized codes for use in claims filing creates a significant challenge for CAM practitioners as HIPAA transaction requirements move toward implementation. To address these issues, any coding system for CAM that may be adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services should reflect the nature and scope of identified CAM interventions, and should allow for modifications to the coding system over time. If these issues cannot be addressed in line with HIPAA implementation dates and compliance requirements, then the Secretary should consider alternative strategies that would allow CAM practitioners to comply with the law. Supporting Coverage of CAM Through Information Purchasers, insurers, managed care organizations, and other sponsors of health care coverage need access to timely, reliable information about safe, efficacious, and cost-effective CAM practices and products. Such information will promote equitable consideration of safe and effective CAM interventions in developing health benefit packages, supporting executive decision-making, and guiding policy-makers. Those who help develop benefit packages, including health benefits consultants, have well-established methods and processes for making such changes in coverage. At the same time, there are many barriers to changing the status quo, including concerns about the financial impact of a health benefit not previously offered to the public or for which few data exist. Cost estimates for a new benefit are often low because it is difficult to estimate the number of persons who will qualify for or need the new service, or who actually use the service. Purchasers and providers are willing to respond to consumer demand but find it difficult to make significant changes to benefit packages without sufficient, reliable information. The paucity of clinical and health services research, together with publication and dissemination issues discussed in the chapter on research, have created an information vacuum. Insurers, managed care organizations, public purchasers, employers, and other sponsors are increasingly willing to consider coverage of CAM interventions, but they need an adequate base of information in order to make decisions. Federal support is needed to bridge this information gap. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in NIH, for example, could consider making more health services research findings available electronically. Such information is used by employers, other purchasers, insurance and managed care industries, health benefits experts, health care associations, health education institutions, health policy bodies, foundations, professionals, and consumers. There is a need also for Congress and other government leaders to understand the use of CAM within Federal programs, as well as impediments to the coverage of safe and effective CAM interventions. Reports may be necessary from DHHS (particularly Medicare, Medicaid, and community health centers), DOD, VA, and OPM. More generally, there appears to be a need for the health care industry to become more informed about CAM, research on CAM modalities, and the international experience with such modalities. To meet this need, the Commission encourages health care associations and provider groups to include CAM topics at annual and other pertinent health care meetings. Government leaders and Federal agencies with health care programs also need more information about CAM and are encouraged to help management and staff become more informed. These informational needs may merit or even require Federal support and leadership to develop informational programs on the broad and complex field of CAM. Recommendation 23: Evidence should be developed and disseminated regarding the safety, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of CAM interventions, as well as the optimum models for complementary and integrated care. Actions |23.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should convene a joint public and private task force to identify and set priorities for studying health services issues related to CAM and to help purchasers and health plans make prudent decisions regarding coverage of and access to CAM. [The only prudent decisions should be to cover methods that have been proven safe, effective, and cost-effective. Whether methods are marketed as \"CAM\" is not relevant.]| |O.||Federal agencies, States, and private organizations should increase funding for health services research, demonstrations, and evaluations related to CAM, including outcomes of CAM interventions, coverage and access, effective sequencing and integration with conventional therapies, effective models for service delivery, and the use of CAM in underserved, vulnerable, and special populations. [It is pointless to invest limited health-care dollars investigating or deploying methods that have no proven value.]| |P.||Federal, State, and private entities should fund health services research on the costs, cost-benefits, and cost-effectiveness of CAM interventions and wellness programs. [This falsely assumes that such research will provide substantial benefits.]| |23.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the National Committee for Vital and Health Statistics should authorize a national coding system that supports standardized data for CAM. This system should make possible the collection of data for clinical and health services research on CAM, and support compliance with the electronic claims requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. [Few interventions promoted as CAM have been proven safe and effective for their intended purposes. There is no logical reason to assign insurance codes to methods that are unproven and/or irrational.]| |23.5||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, through its clearinghouse, should provide information on health services research, demonstrations, and evaluations of CAM services and products. [The NCCAM and its predecessors were created for this purpose but have not identified a single \"safe and effective service or product.\" Nor have they set up an honest clearinghouse. People who ask for information about specific practices are usually referred to proponents and almost never referred to science-based critics.]| |Q.||Public agencies and private organizations should support the development of informational programs on CAM targeted to health plan purchasers and sponsors, health insurers, managed care organizations, consumer groups, and others involved in the provision of health care services. [The amount of useful information that fits this description is trivial. This appears to be a brazen proposal for goverment agencies to help market \"CAM\" methods. If anything, the public needs more information about what CAM methods are known to be ineffective.]| |R.||Congress should request periodic reports from appropriate Federal departments on coverage of and reimbursement for CAM practices and products for Federal beneficiaries, Medicaid beneficiaries, Federal employees, military personnel, veterans, and eligible family members and retirees, as well as any legislative, regulatory, or programmatic impediments to covering safe and effective CAM interventions. [The big \"impediment\" is lack of evidence that they work. Unless \"CAM services and products\" are proven useful, there is no reason for policymakers to concern themselves about third-party reimbursements unless they want to know how much money is being wasted.]| Equitable and Impartial Consideration of Safe, Effective CAM Interventions Coverage Policies and Processes Any medical or health care intervention that has undergone scientific investigation and has been shown to improve health or functioning or to be effective in treating the chronically or terminally ill should be considered for inclusion in health plan coverage. To accomplish this, current methods, standards, and processes used to gather evidence and make decisions regarding coverage for conventional medicine should be extended to CAM. [This falsely implies that many \"CA,\" methods are valuable.] These methods, standards, and processes should not be prejudiced toward any philosophy of health care, but give equitable consideration to safe and efficacious interventions for both conventional health care and CAM. [This falsely suggests that the difference between conventional medicine and \"CAM\" is one of philosophy, rather than science.] The Commission's intent, in general, is that conventional medicine and CAM be considered in a similar manner with adjustments to accommodate differences in philosophical approach, not to unilaterally propel CAM into the conventional model. [Scientific medicine is built on a solid foundation of logic and rational experimentation. \"CAM\" is based on smoke and missors. The Commission attempts to trivialize this difference by calling it a difference in \"philosophy.\"] This challenge should be met by private employers and sponsors of health coverage, insurers, managed care organizations, and Federal purchasers including DHHS, DOD, VA, and OPM. Within DHHS, it is particularly important for CMS and HRSA to address CAM throughout their policies and procedures, and to identify statutory and regulatory issues. Adequate evidence as to safety and efficacy already exist for considering coverage of some CAM interventions. [How many is \"some\"? Why doesn't the Commission list them so the nature and size of the list can be evaluated?] Where there is such evidence, CAM practices and products should be considered for coverage and reimbursement through processes similar to those already in use, modified only to the extent necessary to accommodate the fundamental differences in philosophy and treatment approach that underpin CAM. [This is double-talk. The primary criteria for coverage are safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. \"Philosophy\" has no relevance.] For example, private health insurance and managed care companies conduct a number of activities that contribute to the benefit design process, including cost-benefit comparisons between current and proposed packages; appraisals of the competition; review of long-term corporate goals; estimates of potential financial liability and losses; and assessments of key factors such as employer and customer requests, potential revenues from redesigned packages, and trends in the economy and marketplace. The often-engrained viewpoints within both conventional medicine and CAM may hamper efforts to modify coverage processes to consider including CAM interventions. Each health care industry has knowledge gaps and negative perceptions about the other. For example, those who are skeptical about CAM may oppose [\"May\" oppose? Are they kidding?] coverage on the basis that CAM interventions are not backed by valid, reliable research. [That's a very good reason not to cover them.] Those who support CAM may be more willing to accept preliminary research findings as persuasive evidence that CAM services should be covered. [Preliminary research findings might be reason to do more research. But they should not be used as a basis for coverage.] Such differences in perspective may be overcome through cooperative efforts and working relationships between CAM and conventional health care experts. The public and private sectors offer many opportunities for CAM and conventional health care experts to work together, for example, advisory committees and other workgroups related to health services research and coverage. [WCCAMP's failure to produce a useful report shows why collaboration with \"CAM\" advocates is likely to be a waste of time.] Determining When to Pay For or Provide CAM Once health insurers, managed care companies, and government agencies have decided to cover a benefit, additional procedures must be followed before arriving at a decision to approve or pay for it in a particular situation. The procedures commonly include two questions: 1) Are the circumstance for use of the service or product investigational, and 2) Is use of the service or product medically necessary in the current situation? For example, a health insurance company may decide to add acupuncture to its benefit, but may limit coverage to situations in which acupuncture is no longer considered investigational, such as control of nausea during cancer treatment and treatment of certain pain conditions. In addition, the company will review each request to approve or pay for the service on a case-by-case basis to determine whether acupuncture was indeed medically necessary in that situation. A health care service or product is considered no longer investigational if it has been proven through scientific methods to be safe and effective at improving health outcomes, or if, in cases where the scientific evidence is still unfolding, expert consensus regarding its safety and efficacy is established. Various parties, such as a national professional association, a government agency such as CMS, or an organization hired to advise a health insurance or managed care company may make such a determination. In the private health care market, insurers and managed care companies often follow one another's lead in determining whether a service or product as safe and beneficial. [The scientific community has many mechanisms to arrive at a consensus about what works. By definition, \"alternative\" methods lack scientific support.] The process of determining what is medically necessary is critical to controlling use of and spending on health care services, determining the cost estimates on which premiums are based, and maintaining the financial soundness of the insurance and managed care industries. Decisions are usually made by practitioners on the basis of criteria that have been developed by bodies of experts, including professional organizations, academic medical institutions, private companies, and, in some circumstances, the insurers and managed care companies themselves. Often, the criteria are developed from studies sponsored by or the work of advisory groups for government agencies, such as AHRQ, CMS, and NIH. Government-funded programs, like Medicare develop their own coverage criteria and offer guidance either nationally or at the local level through Medicare payment contractors. Insurers and HMOs rely heavily on medical necessity criteria to define the extent of a benefit, manage the use of it, and make claims payment decisions. Controlling health care use and expenditures is fundamental to managing a company's insurance risk and to the financial stability of managed care and third-party reimbursement systems. Methods of determining investigational status and medical necessity work for CAM as long as interventions fit the conventional medical model, but they often restrict the integration of, and the complementary use of, \"alternative\" services and products. [Yes, methods that are unsubstantiated and lack a scientifically plausible rationale are usually (and justifiably) \"restricted.\"] At this time, few criteria are available to guide practitioners in deciding the medical or, more generally, the clinical necessity of CAM interventions. [That is nonsense. The methods for judging effectiveness are well established and should be the same whether something is considered conventional or marketed as \"CAM.\" The Commission appears to be suggesting that if \"CAM\" methods can't be proven effective under the rules of science, the rules of science should be bent or bypassed.] New medical and health services research on CAM, when published, will help to fill this need. [This falsely assumes that scientific research will prove that many \"CAM\" methods are valid. Agencies of DHHS (including NIH, AHRQ, and CMS) could convene groups of experts and hold conferences to assess the state-of-the-science of a particular CAM approach or treatment, and develop consensus statements, guidance for clinical use, and coverage policy. Other government bodies and nongovernmental organizations could sponsor similar efforts. [Enough is already known to discard most \"CAM\" practices. It is not possible to write guidelines for irrational practices.] Federal leadership is needed to help guide changes in health plan coverage for safe and effective CAM services and products and to develop criteria for the use of CAM interventions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, preferably through a centralized CAM office, should work with insurance companies, health care and professional associations, health insurers and managed care companies and associations, employers, other Federal departments, States, CAM professionals and associations, benefits experts, and others to accomplish these goals. [The Commission would like political endorsement for methods that can't pass scientific muster.] To make coverage of CAM more readily available to consumers, private and public entities should develop clinical necessity criteria or clinical appropriateness criteria for circumstances in which CAM is proven to be safe and effective. Such circumstances could include preventing a condition or the progress of a condition, allaying symptoms or side-effects of conventional treatments such as pain or nausea, and helping patients, particularly with life-threatening illnesses, cope with their conditions. [This falsely implies that many \"CAM\" methods are useful. Coverage and the Need for Authority to Practice Coverage of and reimbursement for most health care services are linked to a provider's ability to furnish services legally within the scope of their practice. This legal authority to practice is given by the State in which services are provided. Thus, even if insurers, managed care organizations, employers, and other health plan sponsors are interested in covering safe, cost-effective CAM interventions, they cannot do so unless there are properly licensed (or otherwise legally authorized) practitioners in a State. State laws and processes that establish professional standing protect the public by ensuring that covered health benefits are provided by qualified practitioners whose services should meet recognized standards of care. Moreover, in the absence of such laws, health insurers, managed care organizations, and any other entities that provide services would be at increased risk of liability if an adverse event occurred. [This falsely assumes that there are many competent \"CAM\" practioners who are unlicensed.] CAM practitioners qualified to furnish safe, beneficial services for which purchasers, insurance companies, managed care organizations, and other payers are willing to pay should have the ability to practice legally in their State, just as conventional practitioners do. [The basic requirement for licensure should be clinical competence, not whether the person is identified as practicing \"CAM.\" Other Issues The Internal Revenue Code allows employers and other health plan sponsors to deduct the costs of providing accident and health insurance. Although the Federal code includes chiropractic and acupuncture as deductible medical expenses, the current policy approach is weighted heavily toward conventional medical care and physician direction of services. This approach could be modified to allow purchasers, health insurers, and managed care companies to develop health benefit packages that include safe and beneficial CAM interventions that qualify fully for favorable tax treatment under the law and regulations. In addition, Federal policy-makers are encouraged to monitor evidence on the benefits and cost-effectiveness of CAM interventions and health promotion programs with an eye to possible modifications of the tax code in the future. [This falsely assumes that many uncovered services are cost-effective.] Recommendation 24: Insurers and managed care organizations should offer purchasers the option of health benefit plans that incorporate coverage of safe and effective CAM interventions provided by qualified practitioners. Actions |S.||Health insurance and managed care companies should modify their benefit design and coverage processes in order to offer purchasers, for their consideration, health benefit plans that include safe and effective CAM interventions. [Most insurance companies need no prodding to cover methods that have been proven effective. The vast majority of \"CAM\" methods have not even been scientifically tested.]| |24.2||Health insurance and managed care companies should make use of CAM expertise in the development of benefit plans that include safe and effective CAM interventions. [This falsely assumes that such methods are useful and that \"CAM\" advocates can be trusted to sort out what should be covered.]| |24.3||Health insurers, managed care organizations, CAM professional associations, CAM experts, private organizations that develop medical criteria, and Federal agencies are encouraged to develop appropriate clinical criteria and guidelines for the use of CAM services and products. [This falsely assumes that many such modalities exist and that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice.]| Recommendation 25: Purchasers, including Federal agencies and employers, should evaluate the possibility of covering benefits or adding health benefit plans that incorporate safe and effective CAM interventions. Actions |25.1||Employers, Federal agencies, other purchasers and sponsors should enhance the processes they use to develop health benefits and give consideration to safe and effective CAM interventions.| |25.2||Public purchasers such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Defense, employers, other health benefit sponsors, and health industry organizations should include CAM practitioners and experts on advisory bodies and workgroups considering CAM benefits and other health benefit issues. [This falsely assumes that many such modalities exist and that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice.]| |T.||The Secretary of Health and Human Services, preferably through the Federal CAM coordinating office when established, should maintain a list of opportunities for CAM experts to participate on advisory committees and other workgroups. [This assumes that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice. The WHCCAMP report shows the absurdity of this assumption.]| |25.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should direct agencies under his authority to convene workgroups and conferences to assess the state-of-the-science of CAM services and products and to develop consensus and other guidance on their use. [Government agencies normally promote methods that have been proven effective. There is no reason to give special consideration to methods that are marketed as \"CAM.\"]| |25.5||State governments should consider, as part of evaluating and reviewing their regulations, how regulation of CAM practitioners could affect third-party coverage of safe and effective CAM interventions. [Third party coverage is normally based on scientific merit. \"CAM\" advocates hope to promote through political means what they cannot accomplish through science.]| References - Current Population Survey.

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-nine-hundred-fifty-eight) [Analysis of the Final WHCCAMP Report: Chapter 8](https://quackwatch.org/political-activities/whc/8-2/) In recent years, people have come to recognize that a healthy lifestyle can promote wellness and prevent illness and disease, allowing them to enjoy a long, high-quality life. To achieve this goal, many people have used various approaches, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). [This is a crass attempt to equate \"CAM\" with \"healthy behaviors\" without any evidence to support such an association. There is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve health. In fact, many \"CAM practitioners denigrate and oppose the proven public health measures such as vaccination and fluoridation, and many advocate dietary practices that are irrational and unhealthy.] Wellness is defined in many different ways, but all agree that it is more than the absence of disease. For some it is ... In recent years, people have come to recognize that a healthy lifestyle can promote wellness and prevent illness and disease, allowing them to enjoy a long, high-quality life. To achieve this goal, many people have used various approaches, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). [This is a crass attempt to equate \"CAM\" with \"healthy behaviors\" without any evidence to support such an association. There is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve health. In fact, many \"CAM practitioners denigrate and oppose the proven public health measures such as vaccination and fluoridation, and many advocate dietary practices that are irrational and unhealthy.] Wellness is defined in many different ways, but all agree that it is more than the absence of disease. For some it is the achievement of one's fullest potential, for others it is an integration of body, mind, and spirit. Wellness can include a broad array of activities and interventions that focus on the physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional aspects of one's life. [\"Wellness\" is a marketing term that facilitates the marketing of questionable products and services to healthy people.] Since the publication of Healthy People: The Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in 1979 [1],1 the U.S. Public Health Service has led an initiative to define goals and objectives for the health of the U.S. population and to direct resources for improving the Nation's health. The goals and objectives are updated periodically, along with a progress report on their attainment, and have been published as Healthy People 2000 [2] and 2010 [3].3 Long-range goals and objectives for Healthy People 2020 are currently being developed. [\"CAM\" has contributed nothing unique to these endeavors. Moreover, some \"CAM\" advocates actively oppose some of the goals.] As the Healthy People 2000 and 2010 reports illustrate, approaches to improving health and wellness, preventing illness and disease, and managing disabilities and chronic conditions require the involvement of a wide range of disciplines and social institutions. [\"CAM\" has contributed nothing unique toward these endeavors.] The effectiveness of the health care delivery system in the future will depend upon its ability to make use of all approaches and modalities that provide a sound basis for promoting optimal health. People with better health habits have been shown to survive longer and to postpone and shorten disability [4]. [\"CAM\" has contributed nothing unique to the progress of medical science.] CAM practices such as acupuncture, biofeedback, yoga, massage, and tai chi, as well as certain nutritional and stress reduction practices, may be useful in contributing to the achievement of the nation's health goals and objectives. [This statement is an incredible bare-faced lie. Standard nutrition practices are central to public health goals. The rest of the items contribute nothing.] Helping people achieve a healthy, meaningful, and long life is the fundamental purpose of all health care systems. In the United States, great strides have been made in conquering disease and extending life, and the health care system reflects these remarkable scientific advances. [\"CAM\" has contributed nothing unique to the progress of medical science.] Yet in the quest to conquer illness and disease, national wellness and prevention efforts have been focused primarily on immunizations, disease screening and monitoring (e.g., pap smears blood pressure checks), and services offered in response to an already identified illness or condition (e.g., physical therapy after stroke, nutritional counseling for diabetics). [\"CAM\" has contributed nothing useful and unique to preventive health care.] With some notable exceptions, wellness and health promotion have, for the most part, been left to the initiative and discretion of the individual. [This statement trivializes all of the preventive and public health programs promoted by government, professional, and volunatry organizations.] The Commission believes that it is time for wellness and health promotion to be a national priority and for the role of CAM in these efforts to be explored further. [This falsely assumes that \"CAM\" advocates have something useful to offer.] The concomitant rise of interest in CAM and in wellness and prevention presents many new and exciting opportunities for the health care system. There is evidence that certain CAM practices, when administered by properly trained practitioners, may be beneficial. [Note that they fail to identify a single one.] Evaluating safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to wellness and health promotion activities presents new and exciting areas to explore in the quest to improve health outcomes and quality of life. [This falsely assumes that research into \"CAM\" methods will demonstrate that they can improve public health.] The Role of Safe and Effective CAM Practices and Products in Promoting Wellness and Helping to Achieve the Nation's Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Goals The most recent Federal government report on the health status of the nation, Healthy People 2010, is designed to further two overarching goals: 1) increasing the quality and years of healthy life and 2) eliminating disparities in health. These goals and objectives are the blueprint for the nation's health promotion and disease prevention activities, and they influence data collection, national health policy, and program development and implementation. Healthy People 2010 addresses clinical, behavioral, environmental, and health system issues that affect health, and it emphasizes on health education and changing the health-related behaviors of individuals and communities. The principles that underlie CAM practices are consistent with the two overarching goals of Healthy People 2010. Several CAM practices have shown promise in addressing some of the specific objectives outlined in Healthy People 2010, such as massage therapy to reduce the limited activity caused by chronic low back pain (Objective 2-11), meditation or biofeedback to reduce high blood pressure (Objectives 12-9 through 12-12), and tai chi to increase physical activity and flexibility (Objectives 22-1 through 22-5). These and other CAM practices and products that have been shown to be safe and effective should be evaluated to determine their potential for helping to achieve the nation's health promotion and disease prevention goals and objectives. The Healthy People Consortium, which includes over 600 Federal, state, and national organizations, should form a working group to evaluate the potential impact of safe and effective CAM practices and products on the nation's leading health indicators (physical activity, overweight and obesity, tobacco use, substance abuse, responsible sexual behavior, mental health, injury and violence, environmental quality, immunization, and access to health care). Strategies, including demonstration projects, should be developed to incorporate CAM practices and products found to have potential benefit to address these indicators and promote healthy lifestyles. Wellness and Health Promotion for Children For no other group is the learning and adoption of healthy behaviors and lifestyle choices more important than for children and young people. Although many programs address some of the pressing issues facing American youth, the statistics remain sobering, with unintentional injuries, homicides, and suicides accounting for the majority of deaths between the ages of 1 and 24 [3].3 Serious, chronic conditions are beginning earlier in life, as shown by the recently released The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity.5 This report highlights many of the health issues facing children who are overweight, including heart disease, diabetes, and depression, and states that risk factors for heart disease (e.g., high cholesterol and high blood pressure) occur with increased frequency among overweight children. Numerous reports have cited the dramatic increase of Type II diabetes in children and adolescents in recent years, which is also strongly associated with being overweight [6,7].6,7 Early interventions that promote the development of good health habits and attitudes could help prevent many of the negative behaviors and lifestyle choices that begin early in life. Poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, smoking, suicide, substance abuse, homicide, and depression are a silent epidemic among young people and should be considered a national priority. While many individual programs address these problems, safe and effective CAM principles and practices should be evaluated to determine their potential role in transforming the unhealthy behavior responsible for U.S. youths' dismal health statistics. Those CAM principles and practices that have been shown to be appropriate for children and young people should be included as part of a national effort and involve all sectors of the community, especially the schools. Parents, schools, communities, businesses, influential individuals, and the media should become part of a national campaign to heighten children's interest in and awareness of health issues, including how their behavior affects their life and environment and how they can establish good habits for coping with life's stresses. This effort could be similar to other national initiatives, such as those to increase seat belt use, decrease alcohol consumption when driving, and modify other behaviors that impact on public health. Schools are a particularly important part of any strategy. Schools provide activities and services to promote students' physical, emotional, and social development and they usually require that some form of health education be taught. The teaching of safe and effective CAM practices in schools to improve nutrition, reduce stress, resolve conflicts, and develop healthy lifestyles should be evaluated to determine if it can complement the efforts already under way to improve the health and well-being of young people. School programs are locally designed and implemented, and what works in one community may not work in another. Therefore, it is essential that members of the local community (children, parents, teachers, school boards, and others) be involved in these activities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed guidelines for schools to use to increase physical activity, promote healthy eating, prevent tobacco use and addiction, and prevent HIV infection [14].14 The Health Resources and Services Administration, in conjunction with the American Academy of Pediatrics, is developing guidelines for schools that address comprehensive physical and mental health and safety programs. Other Federal organizations, such as the Department of Agriculture, also produce information to assist schools in promoting health. A public-private working group should be established to evaluate the applicability of safe and effective CAM practices and products to existing guidelines. In addition to representatives from Federal organizations, CAM professionals, and parent and teacher groups should be included, and the guidelines should reflect the cultural diversity in school systems. Innovative programs that are successfully addressing wellness promotion and disease prevention in schools should be identified so that other schools can learn from them and, if appropriate, adapt them for use in developing their own programs. For example, a group of middle schools in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area has developed school nutrition advisory councils to promote the nutritional health of students. This is part of the Teens Eating for Energy and Nutrition at Schools (TEENS) program, which encourages adolescents to adopt good dietary habits to reduce their risk of cancer risk [15].15 Some elementary, middle, and high schools in New York and California are offering yoga classes as part of their health or physical education curricula. The reported benefits include increased concentration, reduced impulsive behavior, and increased self-esteem [16].16 Wellness and Health Promotion in the Workplace Most adults in the United States spend a large part of their lives in the workplace, and employers spend an average of $2,400 per employee for single coverage and $6,900 for family coverage annually.17 Premiums rose an average of 11 percent from 2000 to 2001, with small firms bearing a disproportionate share of that increases [17].17 Data consistently show that high levels of stress, excessive body weight, and multiple risk factors are associated with increased health care costs and absenteeism, and that health promotion programs in the workplace can lower health care and insurance costs and decrease absenteeism [18].18 The Department of Health and Human Service's Division of Federal Occupational Health helps Federal organizations improve the health, safety, and productivity of their workforce. It provides comprehensive medical, nursing, and wellness and fitness services at Federal workplaces around the country and serves more than 300 agencies with 1.6 million employees. Other Federal organizations may offer their employees wellness programs as well. Many health promotion programs in the workplace focus on reducing risk factors for illness by encouraging weight loss, smoking cessation, and stress reduction. Studies have shown that stress reduction techniques such as yoga and meditation are beneficial. Evaluations should be conducted to determine the role of safe and effective CAM practices and products in the workplace, and incentives should be developed to encourage those found to be beneficial. Incentives to include CAM in wellness programs and health coverage will vary with the size of the business. For example, larger companies that negotiate health plans through a union will require a different set of incentives than small companies that may only offer limited or no coverage. Some incentives currently exist but have not been evaluated for their effectiveness. Any additional programs or services will have start-up costs that may deter some companies from offering them. Recommendation 26: The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal agencies and public and private organizations should evaluate CAM practices and products that have been shown to be safe and effective to determine their potential to promote wellness and help achieve the nation's health promotion and disease prevention goals. Demonstration programs should be funded for those determined to have benefit. Actions |26.1.||The Healthy People Consortium should evaluate the role of safe and effective CAM practices and products in addressing the10 leading health indicators and develop strategies, including demonstration programs, to encourage the use of CAM practices and products found to be beneficial in addressing these indicators. [This recommendation incorrectly assumes that there are valid CAM principles and practices that the scientific community is neglecting. CAM advocates attempt to boost their credibility by including diet, nutrition, and exercise within their scope. However, the scientific mainstream has addressed these areas for decades.]| |26.2||Questions on the extent and use of CAM products and practices should be included in national surveys and other assessment tools including the National Health Interview Survey, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Where appropriate, information from these sources should be incorporated into the Healthy People 2020 goals and objectives. [It would be worthwhile to investigate the harmful impact of irrational and unsubstantiated methods. However, surveys that merely assess the \"popularity\" of such methods might make them appear more legitimate.]| |26.3||The Department of Health and Human Services, as part of the Healthy People 2010 initiative, should support the development of a national campaign to teach and encourage behaviors that focus on improving nutrition, promoting exercise, and teaching stress management for all Americans, especially children. This campaign should include safe and effective CAM practices and products where appropriate. [This is a crass attempt to equate \"CAM\" with \"healthy behaviors\" without any evidence to support such an association. There is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children. In fact, many chiropractors, naturopaths and other practitioners denigrate and oppose the proven public health measures of vaccination and fluoridation.]| |26.4||The Federal government, in partnership with public and private organizations, should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to improving nutrition, promoting exercise, and teaching stress management to children. Demonstration programs should be funded for those found to be applicable to children. [As noted in #26.3, there is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children.]| |26.5||The Health Resources and Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Education, and other Federal agencies that develop school health guidelines should evaluate the potential applicability of safe and effective CAM practices and products to these school health guidelines. Those found to have benefits should be included in the guidelines. [As noted in #26.3, there is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children.]| |26.6||Federal agencies, in partnership with the business community, should develop incentives for schools to make lunches and snacks healthful, and to limit the sale \u2014 and eliminate the advertisin \u2014 -of high-fat snacks, soft drinks, and other products that do not contribute to healthy lifestyles. [There are valid reasons to promote good health habits to children, but this activity has nothing to do with \"CAM.\"]| |26.7||The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their potential role in workplace wellness and prevention activities, and include them in Federal workplace wellness and health promotion programs and Federal health coverage plans when appropriate. [There is no reason to believe that this would be better than simply encouraging good health habits that have little or nothing to do with \"CAM.\" \"CAM\" programs that disparage standard care or advocate irrational methods would have a negative impact on the health of federal workers.]| |26.8||Federal agencies, in conjunction with the business community, should develop incentives for employers to include CAM practices and products found to be beneficial in wellness and prevention activities in their workplace wellness programs and health coverage. [There is no reason to believe that this would be better than simply encouraging good health habits that have little or nothing to do with \"CAM.\" \"CAM\" programs that disparage standard care or advocate irrational methods would have a negative impact on the health of federal workers.]| The Role of Safe and Effective CAM Practices and Products in Health Care Delivery Systems and Health-Related Programs to Help Promote Wellness and Health and Prevent Disease Federal/State Programs and Systems The Federal government funds many programs that serve vulnerable populations. Among them are Head Start; Meals on Wheels; Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children; Healthy Mothers/Healthy Babies; the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and programs for people with disabilities. These programs have a direct impact on the health and quality of life of the people they serve and may benefit from a wellness and prevention component that includes safe and effective CAM practices and products. The agencies that administer these programs should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to these programs and fund demonstration programs for those found to be applicable. An example of CAM practices and products that might be considered is teaching children in Head Start programs to breathe deeply as a relaxation technique. The State Children's Health Insurance Program might consider whether chiropractic services would be appropriate for this population, and Meals on Wheels might re-evaluate the type of food being served. Appropriately trained CAM providers should be part of the evaluation and decision-making process. Federally funded health care delivery programs should also evaluate the applicability of CAM wellness and prevention activities into their services. This includes the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has 172 hospitals and more than 500 other health care facilities serving 25 million persons; the Indian Health Service, serving 1.5 million American Indians and Alaskan Natives; community and migrant health centers, serving more than 10 million people who otherwise would not have access to care; maternal and child health programs; and school health programs. Demonstration programs should be funded for those CAM practices and products found to benefit these populations. Public and Private Programs and Systems Much of the research, education, training, services, reimbursement, and information development and dissemination activities of the health care system is directed toward identifying and treating diseases and conditions. Although many hospitals have begun to offer community programs that focus on wellness and prevention, these activities often occur outside the system of primary health care and rely upon consumers' knowing that these activities exist, belief in their potential benefit, ability to pay for them out-of- pocket, and ability to access them. Public and private health care programs and systems should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their role in wellness and prevention activities for individuals and communities. The Department of Health and Human Services should help bring together organizations from the private and public sectors for this purpose and help to develop strategies to promote the use of those found to be beneficial. Representatives of national, state, and local organizations of clinicians, administrators, health plans, pharmacists, nurses, mental health professionals, consumers, and others from hospitals, long-term care facilities, and programs serving the aging, the dying, and those with disabilities or chronic illness should be included with CAM professionals and institutions in this process. Recommendation 27: Federal, State, public, and private health care delivery systems and programs should evaluate CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to programs and services that help promote wellness and health. Demonstration programs should be funded for those determined to be beneficial. Actions |27.1||The Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, and Defense and the Commissioner of the Administration for Children and Families, should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products that contribute to wellness and health and determine their applicability to Federal health systems and programs. [This falsely assumes that many safe and effective \"CAM\" practices and products exist and need special federal promotion to gain recognition.]| |27.2||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should facilitate the bringing together of public and private health care organizations to evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products that contribute to wellness and health and determine their applicability to health systems and programs, especially in the nation's hospitals and long-term care facilities and in programs serving the aging, those with chronic illness, and those at the end of life. [There is no logical reason to believe that adding \"CAM\" services to health systems or programs would make such programs more effective or cost-effective. Before investing in any such research, there should be data showing that such an investment would be worthwhile.]| |27.3||CAM and conventional health professional training programs should consider offering training and educational opportunities for students in self-care and lifestyle decision-making to improve practitioners' health and to enable practitioners to impart this knowledge to their patients or clients. [Conventional training and public health programs already offer this. There is no reason to believe that \"CAM\" practitioners have something additional to offer.]| The Role of Safe and Effective CAM Practices and Products in Wellness and Health Promotion and the Application of CAM Principles and Practices to the Management of Chronic Disease Although a significant percentage of people who use CAM practices and products do so to prevent disease and promote health, more information is needed on how CAM approaches can improve wellness and promote health. A related but largely unexplored area is the application of CAM wellness and prevention practices to the management of chronic disease. CAM principles and practices may be useful not only in preventing some of these diseases and conditions, but also in enhancing recovery and preventing further illness. Increased research in this area will help to determine how CAM principles and practices can best be used to meet the goals of the health care system. The core philosophy and orientation of many CAM systems is to support and stimulate the inherent healing capacities of the individual. For example, Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners focus on maintaining the flow of \"qi\" and \"blood\" to balance \"yin\" and \"yang\" for the maintenance of good health. Ayurvedic medicine emphasizes early detection and balancing of \"doshas\" to prevent disease and pathology. Other CAM modalities, such as chiropractic and naturopathic medicine, seek to enhance the body's natural healing system to prevent, treat, and cure disease. A significant portion of the adult population takes supplements and herbs to maintain health. Although many CAM systems and practitioners emphasize the health-promoting nature of their approaches and interventions, research is needed to determine which ones are or might be useful for improving overall health and preventing disease. A systematic review of research to evaluate CAM approaches to health promotion would help identify promising areas for further research and development. In addition to the Federal government, private organizations such as the Institute of Medicine and the American Public Health Association should provide leadership in this area, including assistance in determining how CAM may contribute to the goals of Healthy People 2010 and the development of Healthy People 2020. Recommendation 28: Research on the role of CAM in wellness and health promotion, the application of CAM principles and practices, and the role of CAM practitioners in the management of chronic disease should be expanded. Actions |28.1||The Department of Health and Human Services should fund demonstration projects to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of comprehensive health promotion programs that include CAM. These studies should include underserved and special populations. [There is no logical reason to believe that offering \"CAM\" services to underserved and special populations will enhance their health.]| |V.||The Federal government and private health organizations should evaluate CAM practices and products that are currently being used for wellness and health promotion to determine their effectiveness and applicability to the management of chronic disease. Funding should be provided for demonstration projects in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and other Federal agencies for those CAM practices and products found to have benefit in the management of chronic disease, end of life such as hospice. [This falsely assumes that many \"CAM\" practices and products can be proven useful to chronically and terminallly ill patients and deserve special funding priority.]| References - U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Public Health Service.

Gorski, MD, FACOG] COORDINATION OF RESEARCH Recommendation 1: Federal agencies should receive increased for clinical, basic, and health services research on CAM. Actions |1.1||Federal agencies should increase their activities with respect to CAM in accordance with their biomedical research, health services research, or other health care-related responsibilities and make these activities, including available technical assistance, known to CAM and conventional researchers and practitioners. Activities might include funding initiatives such as requests for applications and proposals; CAM-focused offices or centers; CAM-focused staff positions; CAM advisory committees or the representation of qualified CAM professionals on such committees. [Research priorities should depend on the likelihood that projects will yield significant results and not on whether or not they are marketed as \"CAM.\"]| |1.2||Federal agencies should assess the scope of scientific, practice, and public interest and needs regarding CAM that are relative to their missions, examine their portfolios, and develop funding distribution strategies to address these interests and needs. [Since \"public interest\" is not necessarily related to effectiveness, it should not be a major factor in determining research priorities.]| |1.3||The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality together with The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine should develop ways to expand health services research in CAM and explore methodologies for health services research in this area. [NCCAM and its predecessors have produced no significant findings during its ten years of existence. It makes more sense to abolish it than to increase its funding.]| |1.4||The Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support more research on (1) complex compounds/mixtures frequently found in CAM products, (2) clinical interventions consisting of multiple treatments, (3) how patient-practitioner interactions affect treatment outcomes, and (4) individualizing treatments. [Identifying the active ingredients of promising herbs is a worthwhile endeavor that has been taking place for decades. But this recommendation also supports clinical research on crude extracts (chemical mixtures) that is likely to be unproductive. It might also be useful to study patient-practitioner interactions. However, research expenditures and other incentives should be proportional to probable value, not whether something is labeled \"CAM.\"]| |1.5||n order to protect public health and maximize benefits, Congress should provide adequate public funding for research on frequently used or promising CAM products that would be unlikely to receive private research support. [This falsely implies that their are many promising \"CAM\" products. Frequency use should be considered only if a product appears to be effective.]| |1.6||The Federal government should support research on CAM practices that appear to be effective but may not be profitable to private investors, such as biofeedback, meditation, guided imagery, art therapy, and music therapy. [Research priority should be related to the probability of obtaining useful results, not according to whether something is marketed as \"CAM.\"]| Recommendation 2: Congress and the Administration should consider enacting legislative and administrative incentives to stimulate private sector investment in CAM research on products that may not be patentable. Actions |2.1||Incentives to stimulate private sector investment in CAM research should focus on (1) research on dietary supplements and other natural products that may not be patentable; (2) research on other CAM products that may not be patentable, including therapeutic devices; and (3) the development of analytical methods for producing better quality CAM products. [Research priority should be related to the likelihood of useful results and not to whether products are classified as \"CAM.\"| |2.2||The Federal and private sectors should provide support for workshops to discuss the research needed by regulatory agencies for their review and approval processes for CAM products and devices. [This recommendation puts the cart before the horse. CAM advocates do not need special training in how to get things approved. Regulatory approval is based on proof of safety and effectiveness. Whether methods are standard or are labeled \"CAM\" is not relevant. What counts is whether or not they work.]| |2.3||Federal agencies should develop outreach programs to inform manufacturers of CAM products and devices about the Federal research support available to private industry and how the agency can assist them.| Recommendation 3: Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support research on CAM modalities and approaches that are designed to improve self-care and behaviors that promote wellness. [Research priorities should be determined by the likelihood of useful findings and not whether they are identified as \"CAM.\" Proven self-care and wellness strategies are part of mainstream public health and should not be identified as \"CAM.\"] Recommendation 4: Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support new and innovative CAM research on core questions posed by frontier areas of scientific study associated with CAM that might expand our understanding of health and disease. Actions |4.1||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, assisted by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, should develop guidelines for establishing research priorities in CAM . [NCCAM has supposedly been doing this for many years.]| |4.2||The National Science Foundation, in collaboration with The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, should examine frontier areas of science associated with CAM that are outside the current research paradigm and methodological approaches to study them. [This falsely assumes that that \"frontier areas of science associated with CAM\" are rational but cannot be tested by established research methods. This appears to include alleged supernatural forces such as\"electromagnetic energy flow\" that cannot be measured with scientific instruments.]| |4.3||Multidisciplinary workshops and expert panels should be convened by Federal, private and nonprofit organizations, collaboratively or independently, to explore the challenges in design and methodology presented by research questions in CAM areas that are outside the current research paradigm. [The fact that quack methods cannot be substantiated does not mean that science-based standards of evidence should be lowered.]| |4.4||The National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense are among the Federal organizations that should consider contributing collaboratively or independently to the support of research on core questions in areas described in many CAM systems. [This is a blatant pitch for more research funds for studying methods marketed as \"CAM.\" Research dollars should be allocated according to potial usefulness rather than how they are designated.]| |4.5||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, working with the World Health Organization, should examine investigative approaches for studying the traditional systems of medical practice from a variety of cultures. [The study of folk healing is probably not a cost-effective way to discover new methods.]| Recommendation 5: Investigators engaged in research on CAM should ensure that human subjects participating in clinical studies receive the same protections as are required in conventional medical research and to which they are entitled. Actions |5.1||Licensed practitioners using CAM systems and modalities who wish to conduct or collaborate in clinical research should follow the same requirements as in conventional medical research. They should develop, or partner with a research institution to develop, a scientifically valid research protocol and obtain Institutional Review Board approval to ensure that they meet accepted standards of ethical conduct and their responsibilities to protect human subjects. [These are standard operating procedures for scientific research.]| |5.2||Accredited CAM institutions and CAM professional organizations should establish Institutional Review Boards where possible, and guide their colleagues and members to utilize the Institutional Review Board process, which is required to conduct clinical research.| |5.3||Institutional Review Boards that review CAM research studies should include the expertise of qualified CAM professionals in the review.| |5.4||Research institutions, National Institutes of Health Institutes and Centers, and other Federal research and health care agencies should be more proactive in developing programs that (1) provide opportunities for expert review of promising CAM practice-based observational data by experienced researchers, (2) stimulate practitioner response to the opportunities offered by the programs and (3) facilitate communication and stimulate partnerships between CAM practitioners and conventionally-trained researchers in designing and implementing clinical studies.| Recommendation 6: The Commission recommends that state professional regulatory bodies include language in their guidelines stating that licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized practitioners who are engaged in research on CAM will not be sanctioned solely because they are engaged in such research if they: (1) are engaged in well-designed research that is approved by an appropriately constituted Institutional Review Boards, (2) are following the requirements for the protection of human subjects, and (3) are meeting their professional and ethical responsibilities. All CAM and conventional practitioners, whether or not they are engaged in research, must meet whatever State practice requirements or standards govern their authorization to practice. [This proposal, if implemented, would enable practitioners of quack methods to escape rstate egulatory action by setting up their own Institutional Review Boards.] Recommendation 7: Increased efforts should be made to strengthen the emerging dialogue among CAM and conventional medical practitioners, researchers and accredited research institutions; Federal and state research, health care, and regulatory agencies; the private and nonprofit sectors; and the general public. Actions |7.1||CAM and conventional medical researchers and practitioners should adhere to the same high standards of quality and ethics in all aspects of research and related activities. [This is self-evident but exaggerates the likelihood that \"CAM\" researchers and practitioners can achieve high standards of quality and ethics.]| |7.2||Federal agencies should develop programs to stimulate cooperation and partnerships between CAM and conventional medical professionals and accredited institutions. [This exaggerates the likelihood that \"CAM\" practitioners can enter into useful partnerships with science-based practitioners and their institutions.]| |7.3||Committees reviewing or advising on research, journal submissions, regulatory compliance, and health insurance coverage in both the public and private sectors should include as members or consultants trained, experienced, and properly qualified CAM health care professionals. [This falsely implies that many \"properly qualified CAM health professionals\" exist. TMoreover, the choice of experts should be based on the quality of their work rather than how they label and market themselves.]| |7.4||Multidisciplinary conferences, workshops, and expert panels on CAM research and related activities, including research methodology, should be supported independently or collaboratively by the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. [Such intermingling would have political value for \"CAM\" proponents but is unlikely to add to scientific knowledge.]| |7.5||The nonprofit sector and the private sector should create funding partnerships, whether independently or with Federal agencies, to augment support for CAM research, research infrastructure and training, research conferences, and information dissemination. [Nonprofit and private organizations can give money to whomever they please. Allocation of government funds should be based on scientific standards, not how methods are classified.]| |7.6||The Federal government should support research, including population-based research, to learn more about why people use CAM practices and products, how they determine the safety and effectiveness of the practices and products they use, and what they find satisfying or unsatisfying about them. [If done properly, research of this type could be used to educate people on how to avoid being quacked. But the statistics could also be used to promote irrational methods by trumpeting about how popular they are.]| |7.7||To benefit patients and future research protocol development and to add to our knowledge about the use of CAM, Institutional Review Boards should consider requiring that all research subjects be asked about their use of herbal or other dietary supplements. [This might be important if using dietary supplements or herbs could confound the data. But routine questioning might convey an underlying message that the products are so important that they deserve special consideration.]| |7.8||Federal agencies supporting biomedical and health services research should develop orientation and training programs for public representatives to enhance the effectiveness of their participation on advisory committees concerned with CAM. [It does not make sense to train people whose judgment is so poor that they advocate wildly implausible hypotheses.]| Recommendation 8: Public and private resources should be increased to strengthen the infrastructure for CAM research and research training at conventional medical and CAM institutions and to expand the cadre of basic, clinical, and health services researchers who are knowledgeable about CAM and have received rigorous research training. Actions |8.1||Funding should be made available to accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions develop programs that examine CAM research questions and that stimulate cross-institutional collaborations involving faculty and students in research and research training.| |8.2||Funding should be made available to accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions support joint research and professional education and training programs to enhance the quality and clinical relevance of CAM research and link the research with evidence-based education and training of practitioners. [This falsely assumes that training advocates of irrational practices will lead to valuable results. There is no logical reason to assume that it will. Moreover, CAM is a marketing term, not a genuine field of health care.]| |8.3||Federal health agencies with research training programs and responsibilities that encompass CAM-related questions should be given adequate support to increase research training in CAM. [This falsely assumes that training advocates of irrational practices will lead to valuable results. There is no logical reason to assume that it will. Moreover, CAM is a marketing term, not a genuine field of health care.]| |8.4||Existing resources, such as The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine-supported centers and the National Center for Research Resources' General Clinical Research Centers should be utilized to increase opportunities to conduct clinical research and training on CAM and examine the inclusion of CAM into the clinical setting. [Despite nearly ten years of distributing grant money, NCCAM and its predecessors have produced no useful clinical research findings. It makes no sense to increase their funding.]| |8.5||Federal support should be increased for career development awards, including those that enable investigators focusing on CAM to develop into independent investigators and faculty members, and mid-career awards that provide the time required to mentor new CAM investigators. [The basis for training career investigators should be the quality of their work, not whether they label or market themselves as \"CAM\" investigators.]| Recommendation 9: Public and private resources should be used to support, conduct, and update systematic reviews of the peer-reviewed research literature on the safety, efficacy, and cost-benefit of CAM practices and products. Actions |9.1||The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality should expand its Evidence-based Practice Center systematic reviews on CAM systems and treatments for use by private and public entities in developing tools, such as practice guidelines, performance measures, and review criteria, and for identifying future research needs. [This falsely implies that current methods of scientific review are defective and that \"CAM\" methods should be reviewed differently.]| |9.2||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine should issue a comprehensive, understandable, and regularly updated summary of current clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of CAM systems and treatments for health care practitioners and the public. [Many such summaries have been published. Whether more would serve any useful purpose would depend on who compiles them and whether their conclusions are supported by scientific evidence. To date, neither NCCAM nor WHCCAMP has ever publicly concluded that any \"CAM\" method is worthless and should be abandoned. The call for dissemination of \"evidence\" attempts to conceal how little there is that is worth disseminating.]| EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS Recommendation 10: The education and training of CAM and conventional practitioners should be designed to ensure public safety, improve health, and increase the availability of qualified and knowledgeable CAM and conventional practitioners and enhance the collaboration among them. Actions |10.1||Conventional health professional schools, postgraduate training programs, and continuing education programs should develop core curricula of knowledge about CAM to prepare conventional health professionals to discuss CAM with their patients and clients and help them make informed choices about the use of CAM. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |10.2||CAM education and training programs should develop curricula that reflect the fundamental elements of biomedical science and conventional health care relevant to and consistent with the practitioners' scope of practice. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" deserve advocacy in training programs.]| |10.3||CAM and conventional education and training programs should develop curricula and other methods to facilitate communication and foster collaboration between CAM and conventional students, practitioners, researchers, educators, institutions and organizations. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" deserve advocacy in training programs and that the offerings \"CAM\" advocates are likely to be trustworthy.]| |10.4||Increased Federal, state, and private sector support should be made available to expand and evaluate CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions. [This is a blatant call for promotion of unsubstantiated methods and their advocates throughout our medical educational system. Just the opposite is needed. Science-based accrediting bodies should attack the quackery that that has infiltrated medical education within the past few years.]| |10.5||Expansion of eligibility of CAM students at accredited institutions for existing of loan programs should be explored. [This would help subsidize students at schools of acupuncture and naturopathy whose teachings advocate irrational practices such as homeopathy.]| |10.6||The Department of Health and Human Services should conduct a feasibility study to determine whether appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners enhance and/or expand health care provided by primary care teams.* This feasibility study could lead to demonstration projects to identify: 1) the type of practitioners, 2) their necessary education and training, 3) the appropriate practice settings, and 4) the health outcomes attributable to the addition of these practitioners and services to comprehensive care. [This falsely implies that \"CAM\" advocates have a lot to offer. However, adding ineffective methods to effective ones will increases the cost of health-care delivery but not its quality.]| |10.7||The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal Departments and Agencies should convene conferences of the leaders of CAM, conventional health, public health, evolving health professions, and the public; of educational institutions; and of appropriate organizations to facilitate establishment of CAM education and training guidelines. Subsequently, the guidelines should be made available to the states and professions for their consideration. [This falsely assumes that rational guidelines can be written for teaching irrational methods.]| |10.8||Feasibility studies of postgraduate training for appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners should be conducted to determine the type of practitioners, practice setting, and their impact on clinical competency, quality of health care, and collaboration with conventional providers. [Here WHCCAMP demands that residency training be corrupted by giving CAM advocates free reign to promote their anti-scientific nonsense.]| |10.9||Practitioners who provide CAM services and products should complete appropriate CAM continuing education programs that include critical evaluation of CAM to enhance and protect the public's health and safety. [There is no reason to expect that science-based CAM continuing education programs can be created or that \"CAM\" practitioners would attend such programs or be influenced by them. To be \"appropriate,\" such programs would have to advocate abandonment of \"CAM\" methods that are irrational.| CAM INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT AND DISSEMINATION Recommendation 11: The Federal government should make available accurate, useful, and easily accessible information on CAM practices and products, including information on safety and effectiveness. Actions |11.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should establish a task force to facilitate the development and dissemination of CAM information within the Federal government and to eliminate existing gaps in CAM information. The task force should include consumers, CAM providers, scientists, and conventional health care practitioners. Resources should subsequently be provided to close identified gaps and improve the availability, coordination, and dissemination of information. [The only real gaps in government CAM information are (a) the failure to identify which CAM methods are worthless and (b) the failure of NCCAM and other government agencies to refer people to information sources that are justifiably critical of CAM methods. Setting up more agencies with similar policies would worsen the situation rather than improve it.]| |11.2||Federal Departments and agencies with missions or activities relevant to CAM should 1) develop informational materials about CAM that are easy to understand and use, and 2) support and collaborate with national and local community leaders and CAM leaders and organizations to identify strategies for enhancing the development, availability, and accessibility of information on the safety and effectiveness of CAM practices and products. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |11.3||Increased funding should be provided to the National Library of Medicine and the American Library Association to expand training of librarians to include helping consumers find information on CAM. [This is another way to promote dubious methods. Why should a particular subset of medical literature get special status or attention in libraries merely because it deals with unproven, disproved or irrational therapies? Moreover, it is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |11.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should direct resources to streamline the process of identifying and making available relevant, high-quality CAM information from other countries and in other languages. [This falsely assumes that other countries have high-quality \"CAM\" information available.| Recommendation 12: The quality and accuracy of CAM information on the Internet should be improved by establishing a voluntary standards board, a public education campaign, and actions to protect consumers' privacy. Actions |12.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should form a public-private partnership to review new and existing websites and to develop voluntary standards promoting accuracy, fairness, comprehensiveness, and timeliness of information on CAM web sites, as well as the disclosure of sources of support and possible conflicts of interest. Sites reviewed and found in compliance with the standards could publicize the fact and display a logo denoting their merit. [DHHS's healthfinder.gov already does a poor job of sorting out reliable and unreliable sources of CAM information. There is no reason to believe that another government-sponsored system would work better.]| |12.2||Funding should be provided to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education to conduct a joint public education campaign that teaches consumers how to evaluate health care information, including CAM information, on the Internet and elsewhere. [Whether or not such information is useful would depend upon who compiles and controls it. So far \u2014 for political reasons \u2014 the government-generated teachings about CAM methods have been woefully inadequate. There is no reason to believe that additional funding will modify this situation.]| |12.3||Congress should protect consumers' privacy by requiring all health information sites, including CAM sites, to disclose whether they track users and if so, how that information is used and stored, including whether it is sold to third parties. [Individual privacy should be protected regardless of what information is sought.]| Recommendation 13: Information on the training and education of providers of CAM services should be made easily available to the public. Actions |13.1||The Commission recommends that states require all persons providing CAM services to disclose information regarding their level and scope of training and to make it easily available to consumers. [Consumers who want this information are already free to ask for it. Requiring qualified practitioners to provide it without being asked will merely increase their overhead. Requiring unqualified practitioners to disclose their background would only be useful if consumers could judge the validity of nonstandard credentials \u2014 something very few people can do. The real way to protect consumers is to prevent unqualified individuals from practicing.]| |13.2||The Commission recommends that states disclose information on State guidelines, requirements, licensure, certification, and disciplinary actions of health providers, including CAM providers, and make it easily accessible to the public. [Some state licensing boards already provide such information.Whether doing this is cost-effective and actually protects people has not been demonstrated. Curiously, far less public information is available about chiropractors than about medical doctors and other mainstream practitioners.]| Recommendation 14: CAM products that are available to U.S. consumers should be safe and meet appropriate standards of quality and consistency. Actions |14.1||The efforts of both the public and private sectors to ensure the development, validation, and dissemination of analytical methods and reference materials for dietary supplements should be accelerated.| |14.2||The proposed Good Manufacturing Practices for Dietary Supplements should be published expeditiously, followed by a timely review of comments and completion of a final rule. The Food and Drug Administration should be provided with adequate resources to complete this task. [GMPs deal mainly with the technicalities of manufacturing and the cleanliness of manufacturing and storage facilities. They are not a substitute for ensuring that the health claims for such products are legitimate. Worthless or dangerous products prepared according to GMPs are still worthless or dangerous.]| |14.3||Adequate funding should be provided to appropriate Federal agencies, including U.S. Customs and Food and Drug Administration inspection authorities, to enforce current laws monitoring the quality of imported raw materials and finished products intended for use as dietary supplements. [The FDA already has the legislative tools to do this, but many other tasks compete for attention from its limited resources.]| |14.4||Manufacturers should have on file and make available to the FDA upon request scientific information to substantiate their determinations of safety, and current statutory provisions should be periodically reexamined to determine whether safety requirements for dietary supplements are adequate. [Manufacturers are already required to have information available to the FDA, but it is obvious that current laws do not protect the public. The only way to protect the public is to require proof of safety and effectiveness before marketing.]| |14.5||An objective process for evaluating the safety of dietary supplement products should be developed by an independent expert panel. [It is not possible to evaluate safety without considering effectiveness.]| Recommendation 15: Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as modified by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, should be fully implemented, funded, enforced, and evaluated. Actions |15.1||The Food and Drug Administration and other agencies with regulatory responsibilities should be provided with additional resources to 1) enforce the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act's regulations regarding labeling of dietary supplements, 2) enforce current provisions requiring that dietary supplements be labeled in English, even if the same information is also included in another language, and 3) employ additional professionals with expertise in dietary supplements. [It is difficult to understand, in practical terms, what such \"additional resources\" would accomplish. It would be far more effective to demand that products be proven safe and effective before they are marketed.]| |15.2||Current provisions requiring disclosure of material facts by manufacturers of CAM products should be enforced, and manufacturers should meet their responsibility to disclose material facts on the label, package, and/or package insert, so that the public will have information about known risks and well-documented significant interactions. Information on potential benefits of dietary supplements should also be made easily available at the time of purchase. [Current drug laws require that products marketed for the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of disease be labeled with adequate directions for their intended uses. If dietary supplements (and herbs) had to meet this standard, the industry would collapse.]| |15.3||Congress should periodically evaluate the effectiveness, limitations, and enforcement of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, including its impact on public health, and take appropriate action to ensure the public's safety. [The impact is obvious: since its passage, the marketplace has been flooded with unsubstantiated claims for dietary supplements and herbs. The only appropriate action would be to repeal the law.]| Recommendation 16: Activities to ensure that advertising of dietary supplements and other CAM practices and products is truthful and not misleading should be increased. Actions |16.1||Congress should provide additional support to the Federal Trade Commission to 1) expand efforts to identify false and deceptive advertising of CAM-related health services and products and take appropriate enforcement action when necessary, 2) use appropriate CAM experts in the process of examination of CAM-related advertising, 3) increase activities to help consumers distinguish useful and reliable information from deceptive and unsubstantiated advertising in all forms of marketing and advertising, including at the point of purchase; and 4) seek additional public comment on the benefits and potential problems in the advertising of CAM-related services and products. [This is an excellent recommendation. However, although stronger federal action could drive many CAM entrepreneurs out of business, the U.S. Congress is dominated by CAM advocates who have seriously weakened consumer protection during the past decade. If WHCCAMP really wants more protection for consumers, it should advocate repealing the 1994 Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act which severely weakened FDA enforcement powers. And it should also oppose CAM advocates' efforts to weaken FTC enforcement in the same way.]| Recommendation 17: The collection and dissemination of information about adverse events stemming from the use of dietary supplements should be improved. Actions |17.1||Congress should require dietary supplement manufacturers and suppliers to register with the Food and Drug Administration, and the agency should encourage voluntary registration until such a requirement is in effect, so that manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers can be promptly notified if a serious adverse event is identified. [This is one of the few valid ideas in the WHCCAMP report.]| |17.2||Recent congressional support for improving the Food and Drug Administration's adverse events reporting system should be enhanced by requiring dietary supplement manufacturers and suppliers to maintain records and report serious adverse events to the agency. [This is one of the few valid ideas in the WHCCAMP report.]| |17.3||Additional resources and support should be provided to 1) the Food and Drug Administration to simplify the adverse events reporting system for dietary supplements, and to streamline the database for timely review and follow-up on received reports; and 2) the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other appropriate Federal agencies to increase outreach activities to consumers, health professionals (including poison control centers, emergency room physicians, CAM practitioners, and mid-level marketers) in order to improve both manufacturers' and the public's awareness of and participation in voluntary event reporting. [This might be useful, but it would be more efficient to require that products be proven safe and effective before marketing.]| ACCESS AND DELIVERY Recommendation 18: The Department of Health and Human Services should evaluate current barriers to consumer access to safe and effective CAM practices and to qualified practitioners and should develop strategies for removing those barriers in order to increase access and to ensure accountability. Actions |18.1||The Department of Health and Human Services should assist the States in evaluating the impact of legislation enacted by various States on access to CAM practices and on public safety. [How useful this would be would depends on whether it is done properly.]| |18.2||The Department of Health and Human Services and other appropriate Federal agencies should use health care workforce data, data from national surveys on use of CAM, regional public health reports on CAM activities and other studies to identify current and future health care needs and the relevance of safe and effective CAM services for helping address these needs. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe and effective \"CAM\" activities. No data can identify a \"need\" for \"CAM\" products or services that have not been proven safe and effective.]| Recommendation 19: The Federal Government should offer assistance to states and professional organizations in 1) developing and evaluating guidelines for practitioner accountability and competence in CAM delivery, including regulation of practice, and 2) periodic review and assessment of the effects of regulations on consumer protection. Actions |19.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should create a policy advisory committee, including CAM and conventional practitioners and representatives of the public, to address issues related to providing access to qualified CAM practitioners, provide guidance to the states concerning regulation possibilities, and provide a forum for dialogue on other issues related to maximizing access. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason in order to develop effective methods of training and qualification, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence or method. Rational methods need no special protection. Irrational methods cannot be made safe by writing guidelines.]| |19.2||The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with states, should assist CAM organizations that wish to develop consensus within their field of practice regarding standards of practice, including education and training. The conclusions reached by CAM professional groups concerning these matters should be considered by states and regulatory bodies in determining the appropriate status of these practitioners for such regulatory options as registration, licensure or exemption. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason to develop practice standards, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence. There can be no objective standards for determining who is a \"qualified CAM practitioner.\" The basic requirement for professional practice should be knowledge of scientifically sound practices. Self-identification or recognition as a \"CAM\" or \"conventional\" professional is irrelevant.]| Recommendation 20: States should evaluate and review their regulation of CAM practitioners and ensure their accountability to the public. States should, as appropriate, implement provisions for licensure, registration, and exemption consistent with the practitioners' education, training, and scope of practice. Action |20.1||The Department of Health and Human Services' policy advisory committee, in partnership with state legislatures, regulatory boards, and CAM practitioners, should develop model guidelines or other guidance for the regulation and oversight of licensed and registered practitioners who use CAM services and products. This guidance should balance concerns regarding protection of the public from the inappropriate practice of health care, provide opportunities for appropriately trained and qualified health practitioners to offer the full range of services in which they are trained and competent, maintain competition in the provision of CAM and other health services, preserve CAM styles and traditions that have been valued by both practitioners and consumers, and determine the extent of the public's choice among health care modalities. [This falsely assumes that there are many \"appropriately trained and qualified \"CAM\" practitioners and that consumer use is a measure of effectiuveness. Moreover, there is no logical reason why guidelines and standards should depend on whether or not somthing is marketed as \"CAM.\" This recommendation calls for weakening consumer protection against quackery.]| Recommendation 21: Nationally recognized accrediting bodies should evaluate how health care organizations under their oversight are using CAM practices and should develop strategies for the safe and appropriate use of qualified CAM practitioners and safe and effective products in these organizations. Actions |21.1||National accrediting bodies, in partnership with other public and private organizations, should evaluate present uses of CAM practitioners in health care delivery settings and develop strategies for their appropriate use in ways that will benefit the public. [This falsely assumes that there are many such uses. It deliberately avoids mention of inappropriate uses and what to do about them.]| |21.2||Nationally recognized accrediting bodies of health care organizations and facilities should consider increasing on-going access to CAM expertise to ensure that processes to develop accreditation standards and interpretations reflect emerging developments in the health care field. [Current continuing medical education standards| |21.3||Nationally recognized accrediting bodies, using CAM experts, should review and evaluate current standards and guidelines to ensure the safe use of CAM practices and products in health care delivery organizations. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe \"CAM\" practices and products. As usual, it also fails to call for review intended to exclude unsafe and ineffective modalities.]| Recommendation 22: The Federal government should facilitate and support the evaluation and implementation of safe and effective CAM practices to help meet the health care needs of special and vulnerable populations. Actions |22.1||The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal Departments should identify models of health care delivery that include safe and effective CAM practices, evaluate them, and then support those models which are successful for use with special and vulnerable populations, including the chronically and terminally ill. [This repeats the false assumtpion that many such \"CAM\" methods exist.]| |22.2||The Department of Health and Human Services should sponsor the development and evaluation of demonstration projects that integrate the use of safe and effective CAM services as part of the health care programs in hospices and community health centers. [This repeats the false assumtpion that many such \"CAM\" methods exist.]| |22.3||The Department of Health and Human Services should identify ways to support the practice of indigenous healing in the United States and to improve communication among indigenous healers, conventional health care professionals, and CAM practitioners. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe and effective indigenous healing practices.]| COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT Recommendation 23: Evidence should be developed and disseminated regarding the safety, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of CAM interventions, as well as the optimum models for complementary and integrated care. Actions |23.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should convene a joint public and private task force to identify and set priorities for studying health services issues related to CAM and to help purchasers and health plans make prudent decisions regarding coverage of and access to CAM. [The only prudent decisions should be to cover methods that have been proven safe, effective, and cost-effective. Whether methods are marketed as \"CAM\" is not relevant.]| |23.2||Federal agencies, States, and private organizations should increase funding for health services research, demonstrations, and evaluations related to CAM, including outcomes of CAM interventions, coverage and access, effective sequencing and integration with conventional therapies, effective models for service delivery, and the use of CAM in underserved, vulnerable, and special populations. [It is pointless to invest limited health-care dollars investigating or deploying methods that have no proven value.]| |23.3||Federal, State, and private entities should fund health services research on the costs, cost-benefits, and cost-effectiveness of CAM interventions and wellness programs. [This falsely assumes that such research will provide substantial benefits.]| |23.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the National Committee for Vital and Health Statistics should authorize a national coding system that supports standardized data for CAM. This system should make possible the collection of data for clinical and health services research on CAM, and support compliance with the electronic claims requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. [Few interventions promoted as CAM have been proven safe and effective for their intended purposes. There is no logical reason to assign insurance codes to methods that are unproven and/or irrational.]| |23.5||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, through its clearinghouse, should provide information on health services research, demonstrations, and evaluations of CAM services and products. [The NCCAM and its predecessors were created for this purpose but have not identified a single \"safe and effective service or product.\" Nor have they set up an honest clearinghouse. People who ask for information about specific practices are usually referred to proponents and almost never referred to science-based critics.]| |23.6||Public agencies and private organizations should support the development of informational programs on CAM targeted to health plan purchasers and sponsors, health insurers, managed care organizations, consumer groups, and others involved in the provision of health care services. [The amount of useful information that fits this description is trivial. This appears to be a brazen proposal for goverment agencies to help market \"CAM\" methods. If anything, the public needs more information about what CAM methods are known to be ineffective.]| |23.7||Congress should request periodic reports from appropriate Federal departments on coverage of and reimbursement for CAM practices and products for Federal beneficiaries, Medicaid beneficiaries, Federal employees, military personnel, veterans, and eligible family members and retirees, as well as any legislative, regulatory, or programmatic impediments to covering safe and effective CAM interventions. [The big \"impediment\" is lack of evidence that they work. Unless \"CAM services and products\" are proven useful, there is no reason for policymakers to concern themselves about third-party reimbursements unless they want to know how much money is being wasted.]| Recommendation 24: Insurers and managed care organizations should offer purchasers the option of health benefit plans that incorporate coverage of safe and effective CAM interventions provided by qualified practitioners. Actions |24.1||Health insurance and managed care companies should modify their benefit design and coverage processes in order to offer purchasers, for their consideration, health benefit plans that include safe and effective CAM interventions. [Most insurance companies need no prodding to cover methods that have been proven effective. The vast majority of \"CAM\" methods have not even been scientifically tested.]| |24.2||Health insurance and managed care companies should make use of CAM expertise in the development of benefit plans that include safe and effective CAM interventions. [This falsely assumes that such methods are useful and that \"CAM\" advocates can be trusted to sort out what should be covered.]| |24.3||Health insurers, managed care organizations, CAM professional associations, CAM experts, private organizations that develop medical criteria, and Federal agencies are encouraged to develop appropriate clinical criteria and guidelines for the use of CAM services and products. [This falsely assumes that many such modalities exist and that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice.]| Recommendation 25: Purchasers, including Federal agencies and employers, should evaluate the possibility of covering benefits or adding health benefit plans that incorporate safe and effective CAM interventions. Actions |25.1||Employers, Federal agencies, other purchasers and sponsors should enhance the processes they use to develop health benefits and give consideration to safe and effective CAM interventions.| |25.2||Public purchasers such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Defense, employers, other health benefit sponsors, and health industry organizations should include CAM practitioners and experts on advisory bodies and workgroups considering CAM benefits and other health benefit issues. [This falsely assumes that many such modalities exist and that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice.]| |25.3||The Secretary of Health and Human Services, preferably through the Federal CAM coordinating office when established, should maintain a list of opportunities for CAM experts to participate on advisory committees and other workgroups. [This assumes that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice. The WHCCAMP report shows the absurdity of this assumption.]| |25.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should direct agencies under his authority to convene workgroups and conferences to assess the state-of-the-science of CAM services and products and to develop consensus and other guidance on their use. [Government agencies normally promote methods that have been proven effective. There is no reason to give special consideration to methods that are marketed as \"CAM.\"]| |25.5||State governments should consider, as part of evaluating and reviewing their regulations, how regulation of CAM practitioners could affect third-party coverage of safe and effective CAM interventions. [Third party coverage is normally based on scientific merit. \"CAM\" advocates hope to promote through political means what they cannot accomplish through science.]| CAM IN WELLNESS AND HEALTH PROMOTION Recommendation 26: The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal agencies and public and private organizations should evaluate CAM practices and products that have been shown to be safe and effective to determine their potential to promote wellness and help achieve the nation's health promotion and disease prevention goals. Demonstration programs should be funded for those determined to have benefit. Actions |26.1.||The Healthy People Consortium should evaluate the role of safe and effective CAM practices and products in addressing the10 leading health indicators and develop strategies, including demonstration programs, to encourage the use of CAM practices and products found to be beneficial in addressing these indicators. [This recommendation incorrectly assumes that there are valid CAM principles and practices that the scientific community is neglecting. CAM advocates attempt to boost their credibility by including diet, nutrition, and exercise within their scope. However, the scientific mainstream has addressed these areas for decades.]| |26.2||Questions on the extent and use of CAM products and practices should be included in national surveys and other assessment tools including the National Health Interview Survey, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Where appropriate, information from these sources should be incorporated into the Healthy People 2020 goals and objectives. [It would be worthwhile to investigate the harmful impact of irrational and unsubstantiated methods. However, surveys that merely assess the \"popularity\" of such methods might make them appear more legitimate.]| |26.3||The Department of Health and Human Services, as part of the Healthy People 2010 initiative, should support the development of a national campaign to teach and encourage behaviors that focus on improving nutrition, promoting exercise, and teaching stress management for all Americans, especially children. This campaign should include safe and effective CAM practices and products where appropriate. [This is a crass attempt to equate \"CAM\" with \"healthy behaviors\" without any evidence to support such an association. There is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children. In fact, many chiropractors, naturopaths and other practitioners denigrate and oppose the proven public health measures of vaccination and fluoridation.]| |26.4||The Federal government, in partnership with public and private organizations, should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to improving nutrition, promoting exercise, and teaching stress management to children. Demonstration programs should be funded for those found to be applicable to children. [As noted in #26.3, there is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children.]| |26.5||The Health Resources and Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Education, and other Federal agencies that develop school health guidelines should evaluate the potential applicability of safe and effective CAM practices and products to these school health guidelines. Those found to have benefits should be included in the guidelines. [As noted in #26.3, there is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children.]| |26.6||Federal agencies, in partnership with the business community, should develop incentives for schools to make lunches and snacks healthful, and to limit the sale \u2014 and eliminate the advertisin \u2014 -of high-fat snacks, soft drinks, and other products that do not contribute to healthy lifestyles. [There are valid reasons to promote good health habits to children, but this activity has nothing to do with \"CAM.\"]| |26.7||The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their potential role in workplace wellness and prevention activities, and include them in Federal workplace wellness and health promotion programs and Federal health coverage plans when appropriate. [There is no reason to believe that this would be better than simply encouraging good health habits that have little or nothing to do with \"CAM.\" \"CAM\" programs that disparage standard care or advocate irrational methods would have a negative impact on the health of federal workers.]| |26.8||Federal agencies, in conjunction with the business community, should develop incentives for employers to include CAM practices and products found to be beneficial in wellness and prevention activities in their workplace wellness programs and health coverage. [There is no reason to believe that this would be better than simply encouraging good health habits that have little or nothing to do with \"CAM.\" \"CAM\" programs that disparage standard care or advocate irrational methods would have a negative impact on the health of federal workers.]| Recommendation 27: Federal, State, public, and private health care delivery systems and programs should evaluate CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to programs and services that help promote wellness and health. Demonstration programs should be funded for those determined to be beneficial. Actions |27.1||The Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, and Defense and the Commissioner of the Administration for Children and Families, should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products that contribute to wellness and health and determine their applicability to Federal health systems and programs. [This falsely assumes that many safe and effective \"CAM\" practices and products exist and need special federal promotion to gain recognition.]| |27.2||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should facilitate the bringing together of public and private health care organizations to evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products that contribute to wellness and health and determine their applicability to health systems and programs, especially in the nation's hospitals and long-term care facilities and in programs serving the aging, those with chronic illness, and those at the end of life. [There is no logical reason to believe that adding \"CAM\" services to health systems or programs would make such programs more effective or cost-effective. Before investing in any such research, there should be data showing that such an investment would be worthwhile.]| |27.3||CAM and conventional health professional training programs should consider offering training and educational opportunities for students in self-care and lifestyle decision-making to improve practitioners' health and to enable practitioners to impart this knowledge to their patients or clients.

[Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD and Timothy N. Gorski, MD, FACOG] The White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP) was established by Executive Order No. 13147 in March 2000. The order states that the Commission is to provide the President, through the Secretary of Health and Human Services, with a report containing legislative and administrative recommendations that will ensure public policy maximizes the potential benefits of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to all citizens. The report of the Commission is to address: - The coordination of research to increase knowledge about CAM products, - The education and training of health care practitioners in CAM, - The provision of reliable and useful information about CAM practices and products to health care professionals, and - Guidance regarding appropriate access to and delivery of CAM. The Commission's 20 Presidentially-appointed members represented an array of health care interests, professional backgrounds, and knowledge. Health care expertise was provided by both conventional and CAM practitioners. To accomplish its mission, the Commission held four Town Hall meetings (San Francisco, Seattle, New York City, and Minneapolis) to listen to testimony from hundreds of individuals, professional organizations, societies, and health care organizations interested in Federal policies regarding CAM. In addition to the town hall meetings, the Commission invited expert testimony during its 10 regular meetings held in the Washington, D.C. area The Commission asked clinicians, researchers, medical educators, representatives of health insurers and managed care organizations, benefits experts, regulatory officials, and policymakers to provide informational recommendations and documentation to support them. The Commission also solicited testimony from the public at each of its regular meetings. Finally, the Commission conducted a number of site visits to see first-hand how various medical institutions are integrating CAM into clinical practice and collaboration between CAM and mainstream health care providers. To develop recommendations, the Commissioners divided into work groups, each addressing a particular topic. The work groups' recommendations were then presented to the whole Commission, discussed, and used as a basis for developing final recommendations. Based on its mission and responsibilities, the Commission endorsed the following 10 guiding principles to shape the process of making recommendations and to focus the recommendations themselves: - A wholeness orientation in health care delivery. Health involves all aspects of life \u2014 mind, body, spirit, and environment \u2014 and high-quality health care must support care of the whole person. [Good medical care has always considered these factors.] - Evidence of safety and efficacy. The Commission is committed to promoting the use of science and appropriate scientific methods to help identify safe and effective CAM services and products and to generate evidence that will protect and promote the public health. [To protect the public it is also necessary to identify what methods are ineffective. The Commission has deliberately avoided mentioning that anything called \"CAM\" is unsafe or ineffective.] - The healing capacity of the person. People have a remarkable capacity for recovery and self-healing, and a major focus of health care is to support and promote this capacity. [There is no reason to believe that \"CAM\" methods have any special ability to provide this.] - Respect for individuality. Each person is unique and has the right to health care that is appropriately responsive to him or her, respecting preferences and preserving dignity. - The right to choose treatment. Each person has the right to choose freely among safe and effective care or approaches, as well as among qualified practitioners who are accountable for their claims and actions and responsive to the person's needs. - An emphasis on health promotion and self-care. Good health care emphasizes self-care and early intervention for maintaining and promoting health. - Partnerships as essential to integrated health care. Good health care requires teamwork among patients, health care practitioners (conventional and CAM), and researchers committed to creating optimal healing environments and to respecting the diversity of all health care traditions. - Education as a fundamental health care service. Education about prevention, healthy lifestyles, and the power of self-healing should be made an integral part of the curricula of all health care professionals and should be made available to the public of all ages. - Dissemination of comprehensive and timely information. The quality of health care can be enhanced by promoting efforts that thoroughly and thoughtfully examine the evidence on which CAM systems, practices, and products are based and make this evidence widely, rapidly, and easily available. - Integral public involvement. The input of informed consumers and other members of the public must be incorporated in setting priorities for health care and health care research and in reaching policy decisions, including those related to CAM, within the public and private sectors. CAM is a heterogeneous group of medical, health care, and healing systems other than those intrinsic to mainstream health care in the United States. While \"complementary and alternative medicine\" is the term used in this report, the Commission recognizes that the term does not fully capture all of the diversity with which these systems, practices, and products are being used by consumers, CAM practitioners, and mainstream health care institutions. The Commission recognizes that most CAM modalities have not yet been scientifically studied and found to be safe and effective. The fact that many Americans are using CAM modalities should not be confused with the fact that most of these modalities remain unproven by high-quality clinical studies. The Commission believes that conventional and CAM systems of health and healing should be held to the same rigorous standards of good science. [This statement does not go far enough. The Commission deliberately avoided mentioning that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" are not merely unproven. Many are already known to be irrational, unsafe, or both.] Therefore, substantially more funding for research is needed to determine the possible benefits and limitations of a variety of CAM modalities, especially those that are already in widespread use. Well-designed scientific research and demonstration projects can help to determine which CAM modalities and approaches are clinically effective and cost-effective. With information from these studies, the public can make informed, intelligent decisions about their own health and well-being and the appropriate use of CAM interventions. Conventional and CAM practitioners also will benefit from the dissemination of this information. [Why doesn't the Commission state that present knowledge is adequate to state that many \"CAM\" methods are irrational and ineffective and that many \"CAM\" methods do not deserve additional research?] Although most CAM modalities have not yet been proven safe and effective, it is likely that some of them eventually will be, whereas others will not. The recommendations and actions in this report constitute a road map to help guide research and policy decisions over the next several years as more scientific and other information becomes available. In this context, many of the recommendations and actions may be useful immediately. Others may be more useful once a greater body of scientific evidence has been developed and made available. [Prudent policy requires disclosure of methods that are unsafe or irrational.] The Commission also notes the lack of an appropriate definition of complementary and alternative medicine and the need to differentiate between interventions that have been, or have the potential to be, found safe and effective and those that lack any scientific evidence of safety or effectiveness. Including the entire mix of CAM interventions under one umbrella fails to identify the merits and shortcomings of specific interventions. It is essential to begin separating the safe from the unsafe and the effective from the ineffective. [Much of this separation can be based on current knowledge.] Likewise, the heterogeneous array of education, training, and qualifications of CAM practitioners has made it difficult for the Commission to clearly and succinctly target its recommendations. This limitation must be addressed during the process of implementing the recommendations and actions. Coordination of ResearchThe public's increased use of CAM has added urgency to the need to examine the safety and effectiveness of CAM practices and products and to discover the basic mechanisms underlying them. Basic, clinical, and health services research in CAM are essential for including CAM in the mainstream health care system. In addition, the growing influence of consumers on the health care system has created a need for more population-based research on CAM use and for public participation in shaping the direction of CAM research. [This implies that the scientific community should not be trusted to set its own research priorities.] Federal requirements and opportunities for such participation currently exist. Public members of Federal advisory committees, as well as the agencies they advise, would gain from orientation and training programs on how to provide input most effectively. Support for Research The NCCAM at the NIH is an example of how quality research in CAM can be executed by a Federal agency. [No, it is a perfect example of why \"CAM\" advocated should not have special funding or set their own research agenda. Although the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and its predecessors have existed for ten years and spent more than $100 million for research, it has not produced a single significant research finding. Although its mission is to separate what works from what does not, NCCAM has failed to identify a single \"alternative\" method as effective or as irrational. Moreover, it is pointless to waste scarce research dollars on methods that are highly unlikely or already known not to work.] Similar efforts should now be extended to other Federal agencies. [This falsely assumes that other agencies can't be trusted to set their own research agendas and that methods should be given priority simply because someone labels them as \"CAM.\" These agencies with research and health care responsibilities need to assess the scope of scientific, clinical practice, health services, and public needs regarding CAM that are related to their missions and develop funding strategies to address them. Federal support is particularly needed for research on CAM products that are unpatentable and those that are frequently used by the public but unlikely to attract private research dollars. [This falsely assumes that many herbs and dietary supplements are so promising that they deserve special consideration and greater priority than drugs that are patentable.] Congress and the Administration should consider simultaneous legislative and administrative incentives to stimulate private sector investment in such products. [This could be a good idea as long as no taxpayer dollars are involved.] Also, CAM approaches that appear to be effective but may not attract private investment, should be considered for Federal support. [Whether this is a good idea depends on who judges what \"appears to be effective.\" Federal, private, and nonprofit sector support is essential to developing a body of evidence-based knowledge about CAM. Among the areas in need of study are the complex compounds and mixtures found in CAM products, multiple-treatment interventions, the effect of patient-practitioner interactions on outcomes, the individualization of treatments, modalities designed to improve self-care and promote wellness behaviors, and core questions posed by CAM that might expand our understanding of health and disease. [\"Individualization of treatments\" is a quack notion that even if studies find no evidence that a method has not been shown to work for other people, \"it still might work for you.\"] The Commission commends the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) for its leadership and contributions to CAM research, methodology, research training, and infrastructure development and supports increases in these crucial activities, including database development and information dissemination. [NCCAM has developed potentially useful databases, but it has utterly failed to disseminate reliable and practical information about what works and what does not. Nor has its funding led to the conclusion that any method works or does not work. A few currently funded projects (such as a study of St. John's wort) should yield significant findings, but there is no reason to believe that if NCCAM did not exist that proposals for research for promising \"natural products\" could not compete for funding.] In addition, NCCAM should collaborate with 1) the Institute of Medicine, to develop guidelines for establishing research priorities in CAM and to address the ambiguity regarding definitions of CAM, thus making it easier to decide how to allocate resources; 2) the National Science Foundation, to examine frontier areas of science associated with CAM that lie outside the current research paradigm and to develop methodological approaches to study them; and 3) the World Health Organization, to study traditional systems of medical practice from a variety of cultures. [\"Outside the current research paradigm\" refers to methods that have no rational basis and whose study \u2014 based on current scientific criteria \u2014 would waste limited resources.] The Commission also recognizes the work of the Office of Dietary Supplements, the National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the National Library of Medicine, and the other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are supporting research and related activities in CAM and recommends that they continue their efforts. Scope of Research A dialogue between CAM and conventional medicine appears to be emerging and efforts should be made to strengthen it. CAM and conventional medical practitioners and researchers; accredited research institutions; Federal and state research, health care, and regulatory agencies; private and nonprofit organizations; and the general public need to be included in the dialogue. Communication and cooperation are essential to improving the quality of CAM research and to the success of research applications. [The main effect of such activities is to enable promoters of quackery to trumpet them as evidence that their methods have \"gained official recognition.' There appears to be no evidence that previous \"dialogs\" have produced any useful results.] The same high standards of quality, rigor, and ethics must be met in both CAM and conventional research, research training, publication of results in scientific, medical, and public health journals, presentations at research conferences, and review of products and devices. Properly qualified CAM and conventional medical professionals should be represented on research, journal, regulatory, and health insurance review and advisory committees. [This falsely suggests that (a) many \"CAM\" methods are effective; (b) many \"CAM\" professionals are highly qualified; (c) component organizations within the scientific community have failed to embrace deserving \"CAM\" methods and advocates; and (d) methods and advocates deserve special consideration simply because someone labels them as \"CAM.\" Investigators engaged in research on CAM must ensure that people participating in clinical studies receive the protections to which they are entitled and which are required for all human subjects in clinical research. Moreover, licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized practitioners who are engaged in research on CAM should not be sanctioned solely because they are engaged in such research, as long as 1) their studies are well designed and approved by an appropriately constituted institutional review board (IRB), 2) they are following the requirements for the protection of human subjects, and 3) they are meeting their professional and ethical responsibilities. All CAM and conventional practitioners, whether they are engaged in research or not, must meet whatever state practice requirements or standards govern their authorization to practice. IRBs that review CAM research studies need the expertise of qualified CAM professionals, and accredited CAM institutions and professional organizations should establish IRBs whenever possible. [This is a plea to let quack practitioners set their own research standards and be exempt from consumer protection laws.] Publication of research results in recognized peer-reviewed research journals is needed to provide reliable information about CAM to researchers, clinical practitioners, health services professionals, third party payers and the public. In addition, the decisions of third-party payers regarding access to and reimbursement for CAM therapies should be based on published evidence. Public and private resources can be used to conduct and update systematic reviews of the research literature on CAM. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) should expand its systematic reviews of CAM systems and treatments for use by private and public entities, and NCCAM and AHRQ should issue and regularly update a comprehensive, understandable summary of current clinical evidence in CAM for health care practitioners and the public. [Many such reviews have been published. Whether more would serve any useful purpose would depend on who compiles them and whether their conclusions are supported by scientific evidence. To date, neither NCCAM nor WHCCAMP has ever publicly concluded that any \"CAM\" method either works or doesn't work and therefore should be embraced or abandoned. The call for dissemination of \"evidence\" attempts to conceal how little there is that is worth disseminating.] Research Training and Infrastructure Sustained, adequate funding is essential to building and maintaining a strong infrastructure for training skilled CAM researchers and conducting rigorous research. Federal agencies that have training programs as part of their health care missions should support training that addresses CAM-related questions relevant to their missions. Academic health centers at conventional institutions are gradually developing venues for exchanging experiences with CAM professionals regarding the training of conventional researchers in CAM practices, the introduction of CAM practitioners to the conventional research culture, and inclusion of CAM in research, research training, clinical, and medical education activities. Accredited CAM institutions are gradually expanding their capacity to conduct research and research training and to establish cooperative arrangements with conventional medical health centers. Public and private resources should be increased to strengthen the infrastructure for CAM research and research training at conventional medical and CAM institutions. [This suggests assume that methods should be given priority because someone labels them as \"CAM\" and that many such methods are promising.] Education and Training of Health Care Practitioners Because the public uses both CAM and conventional health care, the education and training of conventional health professionals should include CAM, and the education and training of CAM practitioners should include conventional health care. [Health professionals should be trained to use methods that have been proven safe and effective. Here the Commission suggests that popularity should influence what is taught.] The result will be conventional providers who can discuss CAM with their patients and clients, provide guidance on CAM use, collaborate with CAM practitioners, and make referrals to them, as well as CAM practitioners who can communicate and collaborate with conventional providers and make referrals to them. [This suggests that products and services deserve special recognition simply because they are labeled \"CAM.\"] The education and training of all practitioners should be designed to ensure public safety, improve health, increase the availability of qualified and knowledgeable CAM and conventional practitioners, and enhance collaboration among them. [This falsely assumes that many \"CAM\" methods are not getting the recognition they deserve and that products and services deserve special recognition simply because they are labeled \"CAM.\"] Education and training programs can do this by developing curricula and programs that facilitate communication and foster collaboration between CAM and conventional students, practitioners, researchers, educators, institutions, and organizations. [Here WHCCAMP proposes that the entire health-professional education system be corrupted by making it easier for \"CAM\" advocates to promote their nonsense.] Conventional health professional schools, postgraduate training programs, and continuing education programs should develop core curricula regarding CAM to prepare practitioners to discuss CAM with their patients and clients and help them make informed choices about the use of CAM. . [This falsely assumes that many \"CAM\" methods are useful and should be given special consideration during professional training.] The challenges to developing these core curricula include: - Professional, organizational, and institutional resistance to change, - Lack of funding, - Inadequate incentives to adopt the curricula, - Logistical design, development, and implementation difficulties, - Lack of consensus on curricula, - Lack of adequately trained faculty and faculty development, and - Limited ability to add to already very full curricula. [No, the big \"challenge\" is that \"CAM\" is a marketing term and most methods labeled \"CAM\" don't work.] Likewise, CAM education and training programs need to develop core curricula that reflect the fundamental elements of biomedical science and conventional health care as they relate to and are consistent with the CAM practitioners' scope of practice. [This overlooks the fact that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" clash with basic science and therefore should be discarded.] The challenges to developing such core curricula for CAM education are similar to those stated above. Support for CAM Programs, Faculty, and Students Access to increased funding and other resources for CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at both CAM and conventional institutions* could result in better CAM education and training, which, in turn, could translate into more skilled practitioners, improved CAM services, and greater patient satisfaction and safety. Faculty development is essential for improved CAM education and training at CAM and conventional institutions. Currently, funding is limited and appears to be directed toward only a small number of curricula and program development projects at largely conventional institutions. Increased Federal, state, and private support should be made available to expand and evaluate CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions. [This falsely assumes that methods marketed as \"CAM\" are not getting the recognition and support they deserve.] CAM students, institutions, and professional organizations have expressed considerable interest in participating in loan and scholarship programs. Currently, the only CAM students eligible for participation in the [Scholarship for Disadvantaged Students program](https://bhpr.hrsa.gov/dsa/pages/programs.htm) are chiropractic students. No CAM students are eligible for the [National Health Service Corps Scholarshi](https://www.cfda.gov/public/viewprog.asp?progid=1238)p program at this time. [This proposal does not specify what \"CAM\" programs would be involved or provide any evidence of a shortage of \"CAM\" practitioners.] In general, expansion of Federal loan programs to CAM students appears easier to accomplish than participation in the scholarship program. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) should conduct a feasibility study to determine whether appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners can enhance or expand health care provided by primary care teams. The feasibility study could be followed with demonstration projects to determine what types of CAM practitioners, education and training requirements, practice sites, and minimal clinical competencies result in improved health outcomes. [This proposal falsely assumes that \"CAM\" practitioners can be \"appropriately educated and trained.\"] Additional Education and Training in CAM To improve the competency of practitioners and the quality of services, CAM education and training should continue beyond the entry, professional school, or qualifying degree level. However, before establishing new CAM postgraduate education and training programs or expanding current ones, appropriate CAM candidates must be identified and the feasibility, type, duration, and impact of the programs determined. [This falsely assumes that such studies are likely to yield useful information.] Since community health centers represent a unique opportunity for combining education in ethnically, racially, and culturally diverse learning environments with service to medically underserved populations who otherwise might not have access to CAM, current and proposed CAM postgraduate education and training programs affiliated with such centers should be given special consideration. [This falsely assumes that various population groups are not receiving enough \"CAM\" services.] Continuing education can provide a powerful means of affecting conventional and CAM practitioners' behavior, thereby enhancing public health and safety. Currently, the number, type, and availability of programs with content appropriate for all practitioners who provide CAM services and products are not sufficient. Therefore, continuing education programs need to be improved and made available to all conventional health professionals as well as to all practitioners who provide CAM services and products. [There is no published evidence that continuing education of \"CAM\" practitioners improves the quality of their performance.] Development and Dissemination of Information about CAMOne of society's greatest achievements \u2014 and one of its greatest challenges \u2014 has been the dramatic improvement in the development and dissemination of information. Not only does information travel faster, significantly more of it has become available. This is especially true of health information, including information about CAM. To ensure public safety in the continually evolving area of CAM, accurate information must be available so that people can make informed choices. This includes choosing the most appropriate type of practitioner, deciding what type of approach can benefit certain conditions, ascertaining the ingredients in a product (such as a dietary supplement), and determining whether ingredients are safe and can assist in maintaining health. Yet far too often information to help make these choices is nonexistent, inaccurate, or difficult to find. [One reason for this is that \"CAM\" promoters almost never acknowledge their shortcomings.] The ready availability of accurate information is especially important to people who are confronting a life-threatening illness. For someone newly diagnosed with a serious or life-threatening illness, seeking information about their disease and treatment options is often their first course of action. Many people quickly become overwhelmed by the vast array of often conflicting information that is available, and yet for some diseases and conditions, there is a scarcity of reliable information. Promoting Accurate, Easily Accessible Information To be effective, information must be tailored to the population it seeks to reach. People of different cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds frequently have different views of health and healing, different patterns of use of health care services and products, and different ways of acquiring information. People's views and behavior also vary with their age, literacy, and specific health conditions. Informational materials need to reflect the characteristics and behavior of the target population. The Federal government should make accurate and easily accessible information on CAM practices and products available to the public. It can do this by establishing a task force to facilitate the development and dissemination of CAM information within the Federal government and to eliminate existing gaps in information about CAM. In addition, more librarians can be trained to help consumers find information on CAM. [The only real gaps in government CAM information are (a) the failure to identify which CAM methods are worthless and (b) the failure of NCCAM and other government agencies to refer people to information sources that are justifiably critical of CAM methods. Setting up more agencies with similar policies would worsen the situation rather than improve it.] The Internet has given people access to vast amounts of health care information that would not have been available to them previously, but this technology raises concerns about quality. People may be making life-and-death decisions based on information that is misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate. This is particularly true in the case of CAM, for which a broad base of evidence is not yet available. [\"Yet available\" falsely assumes that further investigation will yield an abundant supply of useful strategies.] Establishing a public-private partnership to develop voluntary standards for CAM information on the Internet, and conducting a public education campaign to help people evaluate information, should improve the quality and accuracy of CAM information from this source. Actions should also be taken to protect consumers' privacy. [The scientific standard is that claims should be evidence-based. There is no logical reason why methods marketed as \"CAM\" should have a different standard.] Training, licensing requirements, certification, and scope of practice; regulations; and even definitions of CAM practitioners can vary considerably. Therefore, practitioners' qualifications should be readily available to consumers to help them make informed choices about selecting and using practitioners. Information on State regulations, requirements, and disciplinary actions should also be readily available to help ensure consumers' safety. [Such information would only be useful if consumers could judge its validity \u2014 something very few people can do. The real way to protect consumers is to prevent unqualified individuals from practicing.] Consumers frequently learn about CAM products and services through advertising and marketing. While most advertisers of CAM products and services comply with current laws, misleading and fraudulent health claims do exist. [No published data support the claim that \"most advertisers of CAM products and services comply with current laws.\" The marketing of \"CAM\" products and services is no more legitimate than the services themselves.] Some people, particularly those who are ill, who have limited language or educational skills, or who lack access to the conventional health care system, are especially susceptible to advertisements that promise to cure a disease, symptom, or problem. Not only are some of these products, services, and treatments ineffective, they may even be harmful, especially if they delay necessary treatment or take money away from persons with limited resources. Efforts to enforce existing laws curbing such abuses should be increased. [This is an appropriate recommendation. Note, however, that the body of the WHCCAMP report does not identify a single product or service that is ineffective or harmful.] Ensuring the Safety of CAM Products One of the most rapidly growing areas in CAM has been the use of dietary supplements. Sales of these products totaled $17 billion in 2000, and more than 158 million consumers used them. Dietary supplements are not subject to the same rigorous testing and oversight required of prescription drugs, which are targeted toward disease conditions. While this has greatly increased the public's access to supplements, it has limited the information required on the label regarding potential risks, benefits, and appropriate use. The public expects that products sold in the United States are safe. Since many dietary supplements are purchased without the knowledge or advice of an appropriately trained and credentialed provider, information on ingredients, benefits, appropriate use, and potential risks should be made easily available to consumers at the time of purchase, especially information affecting vulnerable consumers such as children, the elderly, pregnant or nursing women, and people with certain health conditions or compromised immune systems. [Current drug laws require that products marketed for the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of disease be labeled with adequate directions for their intended uses. If dietary supplements (and herbs) had to meet this standard, the industry would collapse.] CAM products that are available to U.S. consumers must be safe and meet appropriate standards of quality and consistency. [Current laws have no such requirement. To ban a product, the FDA must prove that it is unsafe. Since the FDA is unable to monitor and test thousands of individual products, the public is virtually unprotected against supplements and herbs that are unsafe.] Efforts to ensure the development of analytical methods and reference materials for dietary supplements should be increased. Good Manufacturing Practices for Dietary Supplements should be published expeditiously, followed by timely review of comments and completion of a final rule. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will need adequate resources to complete this task. Federal agencies responsible for enforcing current laws monitoring the quality of imported raw materials and finished products intended for use as dietary supplements will also require adequate funding. [The public cannot be protected unless manufacturers are required to prove safety and effectiveness before marketing.] Manufacturers should have on file and make available to the FDA upon request scientific information to substantiate their determinations of safety, and current statutory provisions should be reexamined periodically to determine whether safety requirements for dietary supplements are adequate. [It is perfectly obvious that current laws are not adequate to to protect the public.] An objective process for evaluating the safety of dietary supplement products should be developed by an independent expert panel. Reporting of adverse events associated with dietary supplements is voluntary: Manufacturers and distributors are not required to notify the FDA of adverse reactions that have been reported to them. Congress should require dietary supplement manufacturers to register their products and suppliers with the FDA. [This is one of the few valid ideas in the WHCCAMP report.] Until this requirement is in place, the agency should encourage voluntary registration so that manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers can be notified promptly if a serious adverse event is identified. Dietary supplement manufacturers and suppliers should be required to maintain records and report serious adverse events to the FDA. Additional resources and support are needed to simplify the adverse event reporting system for dietary supplements. The system should be made easier to use, its database streamlined to permit timely review and follow-up on reports received, and its outreach to consumers and health professionals (including poison control centers, emergency room physicians, CAM practitioners, and midlevel marketers) improved. Simplifying the adverse event reporting system will improve both manufacturers' and consumers' awareness of and participation in voluntary reporting. To ensure the safety of the public and to give consumers confidence in the products they are using, Congress should periodically evaluate the effectiveness, limitations, and enforcement of the [Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994](https://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html) and take appropriate action when needed. [The only appropriate action would be to repeal it.] Access and DeliveryThe Commission heard numerous concerns about access to CAM practitioners and products, including access to qualified CAM practitioners, state regulation of CAM practitioners, integration of CAM and conventional health care, collaboration between CAM and conventional practitioners, and the cost of CAM services. Many people expressed a desire for increased access to safe and effective CAM, along with conventional services. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe and effective \"CAM\" services.] The Commission recognizes that Americans want to be able to choose from both conventional and CAM practices and that they want assurances that practitioners are qualified. [This falsely assumes that there are many qualified \"CAM\" practitioners.] Improving Access to CAM As is true of conventional health care, many factors influence access to CAM services and their delivery. The distribution and availability of local providers, regulation and credentialing of providers, policies concerning coverage and reimbursement, and characteristics of the health care delivery system all affect the quality and availability of care and consumer satisfaction. Equally important, access is limited by income, since most CAM practices and products are not covered under public or private health insurance programs. Moreover, access is more difficult for rural, uninsured, underinsured, and other special populations. The issue of access is further compounded by the lack of scientific evidence for many CAM practices and products. A better understanding of how the public uses CAM is needed to determine what can be done to improve access to safe and effective CAM within the context of other public health and medical needs. In additional, more information is needed on what constitutes \"appropriate access\" to CAM services. [This falsely assumes that greater access to \"CAM\" services is needed.] A few community health centers have begun to use the services of CAM practitioners, such as chiropractors, naturopathic physicians, and acupuncturists. These centers might provide models for other community health centers and public health service programs, but first their impact on access to care and the cost-benefit picture needs to be determined. Hospice care for the terminally ill is another important model of care that should be evaluated. Some hospice programs are beginning to include CAM practitioners on the treatment team. The Federal government should support demonstration projects that integrate safe and effective CAM services into the health care programs of hospices and community health centers. [At this point there is no reason to believe that adding \"CAM\" services to community health center or public health center programs would make such programs more effective or cost-effective. Before investing in any such research, there should be data showing that such an investment would be worthwhile.] Special populations, such as racial and ethnic minorities, and vulnerable populations, such as the chronically and terminally ill, have unique challenges and needs regarding access to CAM. Yet efforts to address their access to CAM must take into consideration their need for access to conventional health care, and scare resources must be allocated carefully. The Federal government should facilitate and support the evaluation of CAM practices to help meet the health care needs of these populations and support practices found to be safe and effective. [This restates the false assumption that \"CAM\" is safe and effective, will be supported by further research, and deserves special funding priority.] Ways of supporting the practice of indigenous healing in the United States and improving communication among indigenous healers, conventional health care professionals, and CAM practitioners should also be identified. Now is the time to look at policy options for the future and to design strategies for addressing potential issues of access and safety. A variety of issues need to be considered: protecting the public, maintaining free competition in the provision of CAM services, and maintaining the consumer's freedom to choose appropriate health professionals. The need to maintain CAM styles of practice, rather than allowing them to be subsumed into the conventional medical model, also must be considered when addressing the issue of access. [This suggests that marketers of methods they call \"CAM\" should be exempted from consumer-protection laws.] To improve consumers' access to safe and effective CAM practices and qualified practitioners, and to ensure accountability, the Federal government should evaluate current barriers and develop strategies for removing them. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" are safe and effective and need special protection from government regulators.] It should also help states evaluate the impact of state legislation on access to CAM practices and on public safety. Health care workforce data and other studies can help identify current and future health care needs and the relevance of safe and effective CAM services to those needs. [This falsely assumes that many such methods exist.] Ensuring CAM Practitioners' Accountability to the Public States should consider whether a regulatory infrastructure for CAM practitioners is necessary to promote quality of care and patient safety and to ensure practitioners' accountability to the public. The Federal government should offer assistance to states and professional organizations in developing and evaluating guidelines for practitioner accountability and competence, including regulation of practice and periodic review and assessment of the effects of regulations on consumer protection. When appropriate, states should implement provisions for licensure, registration, and exemption that are consistent with a practitioner's education, training, and scope of practice. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason in order to develop effective methods of training and qualification, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence or method. Rational methods need no special protection. Irrational methods cannot be made safe by writing guidelines.] Nationally recognized accrediting bodies should evaluate how health care organizations are using CAM practices and develop strategies for the safe and appropriate use of qualified CAM practitioners. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason to develop practice guidelines, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence. There can be no objective standards for determining who is a \"qualified CAM practitioner.\" The basic requirement for professional practice should be knowledge of scientifically sound practices. Self-identification or recognition as a \"CAM\" or \"conventional\" professional is irrelevant.] In partnership with other public and private organizations, they should evaluate the present use of CAM practitioners in health care delivery settings and develop strategies for their appropriate use in ways that will benefit the public. Current standards and guidelines should be reviewed to ensure safe use of CAM practices and products in health care delivery organizations. [This falsely assumes that methods marketed as \"CAM\" deserve special consideration.] Coverage and ReimbursementThe coverage and reimbursement policies of public and private organizations that pay for, provide, or insure conventional health care services have played a crucial role in shaping the health care system \u2014 and they will play an increasingly important role in determining the future of CAM and its place in the nation's health care system. [The primary criterion for coverage is proof of safety and effectiveness. Methods should not be considered simply because someone markets them as \"CAM.] Coverage of CAM services and products varies among purchasers of health plans, but employer-sponsored plans appear more likely than others to offer them. These plans generally offer a chiropractic benefit, and a growing number cover acupuncture and massage therapy. [Most such coverage is the result of laws forcing third-party payers to provide coverage whether they want to or not.] When offered, CAM coverage often places a ceiling on the number of visits, restricts the clinical applications, and specifies the qualifications of the practitioner. [This reflects third-party judgments that the covered methods have limited value.] Typically, CAM is offered as a supplemental benefit rather than as a core or basic benefit. [This is done to limit overutilization and to avoid forcing nonbelievers to subsidize the use of irrational methods by believers.] Benefit designs also include discount programs, in which covered individuals pay reduced fees for services provided by a network of CAM practitioners, and annual benefit accounts against which services may be purchased. Barriers to Coverage Overcoming barriers to coverage and reimbursement will require first amassing scientific evidence to assess the benefits and cost-effectiveness of CAM and then giving equitable, impartial consideration to those practices and products proven to be safe and effective. [That is absolutely correct. But it would be a mistake to waste taxpayer dollars to test methods that have an extremely low probability of proving useful.] Gathering a body of evidence will require DHHS, other Federal agencies, states, and private organizations to develop a health services research agenda and to increase funding for studies of the outcomes of CAM interventions in treating acute, chronic, and life-threatening conditions. [Although NCCAM and its predecessors have spent more than $100 million for such research, the yield of useful information has been close to zero. It is pointless to waste scarce research dollars on methods that are highly unlikely or already known not to work.] Research, demonstrations, and evaluations should focus not only on safety but also on clinical effectiveness, costs, and the ratio of costs to benefits. In addition, health services research can be used to support the development and study of models for providing safe and effective CAM within the nation's health care system. Prototypes should include integrative and collaborative models for CAM and conventional health care, comparisons of conventional and CAM treatments for the same condition, and evaluations of various combinations of services and products. Information on health services research should be made available through the clearinghouse of NCCAM. [This falsely assumes that (a) CAM is effective and in comparison with standard medicine and (b) \"integrating\" proven and unproven methods would produce a \"system\" rather than a hodgepodge.] To conduct health services research, investigators need data from claim and encounter forms, specifically data coded using nationally accepted, standardized systems. National coding systems such as Common Procedure Terminology recognize some CAM interventions, but they are currently limited in scope and specificity. More recently, a coding system for CAM procedures, services, and products \u2014 ABC codes \u2014 has been developed and is being used in a number of settings. The National Committee for Vital and Health Statistics and DHHS should authorize a national coding system that supports standardized data on CAM for use in clinical and health services research. In addition, the coding system should support practitioners and insurers who cover CAM services in complying with the electronic claims requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. [Few interventions promoted as CAM have been proven safe and effective for their intended purposes. There is no logical reason to assign insurance codes to methods that are unproven and/or irrational.] Any medical or health care intervention that has undergone scientific investigation and has been shown to improve health or functioning, or to be effective in treating the chronically or terminally ill, should be considered for inclusion in health plan coverage. To accomplish this, health insurance and managed care organizations should modify their benefit design and coverage processes in order to offer purchasers health benefit plans that include safe and effective CAM interventions. Similarly, purchasers should enhance the processes they use to develop health benefits and give consideration to safe and effective CAM interventions. DHHS can support these efforts by convening work groups and conferences to assess the state-of-the-science of CAM services and products and to develop consensus and other types of guidance for Medicare, other public and private purchasers, health plans, and even consumer representatives. [This falsely implies that many CAM interventions are beneficial, important to patients, and deserving of special government attention.] Coverage of and reimbursement for most health care services are linked to a provider's ability to furnish services legally within the scope of his or her practice. This legal authority to practice is given by the state in which services are provided. Thus, even if insurers, managed care organizations, and other health plan sponsors are interested in covering safe, cost-effective CAM interventions, they cannot do so unless properly licensed, or otherwise legally authorized, practitioners are available in a state. State governments are encouraged to consider how regulation of CAM practitioners could affect coverage and third-party reimbursement of safe and effective CAM interventions. [This is backwards. The scope of professional practice should be based on adequacy of training and evidence of safety and effectiveness.] Criteria for Using CAM Once a CAM service is covered, health insurers, managed care organizations, and government agencies must be able to determine whether use of the service or product in a particular situation is generally accepted or investigational, and whether the service or product is medically necessary in that situation. Few criteria are available to guide practitioners in deciding the medical or clinical necessity of CAM interventions. DHHS, preferably through a centralized CAM office, should work with health care and professional associations, CAM experts, health insurance and managed care organizations, benefits experts, and others to guide changes in health plan coverage for safe and effective CAM services and products and to develop criteria for use of CAM interventions. Purchasers, health insurers, and managed care organizations will need CAM expertise when developing changes in coverage and reimbursement policies that involve CAM. CAM practitioners and experts should be included on advisory bodies and work groups considering CAM benefits and other appropriate health benefit issues. CAM in Wellness and Health PromotionIn recent years, people have come to recognize that a healthful lifestyle can promote wellness and prevent illness and disease, and many people have used CAM approaches to attain this goal. Wellness is defined in many ways, but all agree that it is more than the absence of disease. Wellness can include a broad array of activities and interventions that focus on the physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional aspects of one's life. The concomitant rise in interest in CAM and in wellness and prevention presents many new and exciting opportunities for the health care system. CAM's Role in Attaining the Nation's Health Goals Since 1979, the U.S. Public Health Service has led a national initiative to define goals and objectives for the nation's health. As is clear from the resulting Healthy People series, a wide range of disciplines and social institutions is needed to improve health and wellness, prevent illness and disease, and manage disabilities and chronic conditions. The effectiveness of the health care delivery system in the future will depend upon its ability to make use of all approaches and modalities that provide a sound basis for promoting health. [This recommendation incorrectly assumes that there are valid CAM principles and practices that the scientific community is neglecting. CAM advocates attempt to boost their credibility by including diet, nutrition, and exercise within their scope. However, the scientific mainstream has addressed these areas for decades.] There is evidence that certain CAM practices, such as acupuncture, biofeedback, yoga, massage therapy, and tai chi, as well as certain nutritional and stress reduction practices may be useful in contributing to the achievement of the nation's health goals and objectives. Federal agencies and public and private organizations should evaluate CAM practices and products that have been shown to be safe and effective to determine their potential for promoting wellness and helping to achieve the nation's health promotion and disease prevention goals. Demonstration programs should be funded for those determined to be beneficial. [Demonstration programs should not be funded unless without adequate evidence that benefit is likely. No current evidence exists that the acupuncture, biofeedback, yoga, massage therapy, tai chi can promote \"the nation's health promotion and disease prevention goals.\" Prevention strategies based on nutrition science are heavily promoted by government agencies and public and private organizations. There is no reason to believe that methods marketed as \"CAM\" can add to this process.] The Federal government, in partnership with public and private organizations, should support the development of a national campaign that teaches and encourages healthful behaviors for all Americans, including children. The campaign would focus on improving nutrition, promoting exercise, and teaching stress management. [All of this is being done and has nothing whatsoever to do with \"CAM\" practices.] Safe and effective CAM practices and products should be included, where appropriate. The role of safe and effective CAM practices and products in the workplace should also be evaluated, and incentives should be developed to encourage the use of those found to be beneficial. [This falsely implies that such practices exist.] The application of CAM wellness and prevention practices to the management of chronic disease and disabilities is a largely unexplored area. CAM principles and practices may be useful not only in preventing some of these diseases and conditions, but also in enhancing recovery and preventing further illness. Increased research in this area will help to determine how CAM principles and practices can best be used to meet the goals of the health care system. DHHS and other Federal agencies should fund demonstration projects to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of comprehensive health promotion programs that include CAM. These studies should include underserved and special populations. [This falsely implies that many useful (but unspecified) \"wellness and prevention practices\" lie outside the medical mainstream. The Commission fails to note that many chiropractors, naturopaths, and homeopaths are staunchly opposed to proven public health measures such as immunization and fluoridation.] Wellness and Health Promotion in Programs for Special and Vulnerable Populations Early interventions that promote the development of good health habits and attitudes could help prevent many of the negative behaviors and lifestyle choices that begin in childhood or adolescence. Poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, smoking, suicide, substance abuse, homicide, and depression are epidemic among young people. [This is correct but has nothing to do with \"CAM\" practices.] The Commission believes that it is time for wellness and health promotion to be made a national priority. CAM practices and products that have been shown to be appropriate for children and young people should be included in this effort, which must involve all sectors of the community, particularly schools. [This falsely implies that many such practices exist.] The Federal government funds many programs that serve vulnerable populations, such as children, the poor, and the elderly. The programs have a direct impact on the health and quality of life of the people they serve, and they may benefit from a wellness and prevention component that includes safe and effective CAM practices and products. The agencies that administer these programs should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to the programs and fund demonstration projects for those found to be beneficial. [This falsely implies that many such practices exist. Despite ten years of existence, NCCAM has not identified a single one.] Federally funded health care delivery programs, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, The Department of Defense, the Indian Health Service, community and migrant health centers, maternal and child health programs, and school health programs, should also evaluate the applicability of CAM wellness and prevention activities to their services. Demonstration programs should be funded for CAM practices and products found to be beneficial to these populations. Other Federal, State, public, and private health care delivery systems and programs would also be well-advised to evaluate CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to programs and services that help promote wellness and health. [This falsely implies that many such practices exist. Despite ten years of existence, NCCAM has not identified a single one. Nor should any practice receive special consideration simply because it is marketed as \"CAM.\"] The Secretary of Health and Human Services should bring together public and private health care organizations to evaluate the contribution of safe and effective CAM practices and products to wellness and health and to determine how they may be used in health systems and programs, especially in the nation's hospitals and long-term care facilities and in programs serving the aged, persons with chronic illness, and those at the end of life. [This falsely implies that CAM offers special value to people who are elderly, chronically ill, or dying. Despite ten years of existence, NCCAM has not identified a single one. Nor should any practice receive special consideration simply because it is marketed as \"CAM.\"] CAM and conventional health professional training programs should offer students training and education in self-care and lifestyle decision-making, both to improve practitioners' health and to enable them to impart this knowledge to their patients or clients. [Conventional training and public health programs already do this. There is no reason to believe that \"CAM\" practitioners have something additional to offer.] Coordinating Federal CAM EffortsIntegration of safe and effective CAM practices and products into the nation's health care system will require an ongoing, coordinated Federal presence. Establishment of a centralized office is the most effective means of accomplishing this goal. Responsibilities of the office should include: - Coordinating Federal CAM activities, - Serving as a Federal CAM policy liaison with conventional health care and CAM professionals, organizations, educational institutions, and commercial ventures, - Planning, facilitating, and convening conferences, workshops, and advisory groups, - Acting as a centralized point of contact for the public, CAM practitioners, conventional health care providers, and the media, - Facilitating implementation of the recommendations and actions of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy, and - Exploring additional and emerging topics not included in the Commission's Executive Order. The Commission recommends that the President, Secretary of Health and Human Services, or Congress create an office to coordinate Federal CAM activities and to facilitate the integration of safe and effective practices and products into the nation's health care system. The office should be established at the highest possible appropriate level in DHHS and be given sufficient staff and budget to meet its responsibilities. The office should charter an advisory council whose members would include representatives of the private and public sectors as well as CAM and conventional practitioners with the necessary expertise, diversity of backgrounds, and training to guide and advise the office about its activities. [It would be absurd to create an \"office at the highest possible level\" to promote so-called CAM. Doing that would constitute a government endorsement of homeopathy, therapeutic touch, cranial osteopathy, rebirthing and many other preposterous practices that have been embraced by one or more members of Commission.] [WHCCAMP Analysis Index](https://www.quackwatch.org/07PoliticalActivities/WHC/00.html) ||| [Quackwatch Home Page](https://www.quackwatch.org/index.html)This article on March 25 2002. [Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-nine-hundred-sixty-five) [Analysis of the Final WHCCAMP Report: Chapter 1](https://quackwatch.org/political-activities/whc/1-2/) [Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD.] Over the past 30 years, public interest in and use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) systems, approaches, and products has risen steadily in the United States. Depending on how CAM is defined, an estimated 6.5 % [1] to as much as 43% [2 ] of the U.S. population has used some form of CAM. Until recently, the primary response of Federal, state, and local health care regulatory agencies to this phenomenon was to restrict access to and delivery of CAM services to protect the public from unproven and potentially dangerous treatments.

[Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD.] Over the past 30 years, public interest in and use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) systems, approaches, and products has risen steadily in the United States. Depending on how CAM is defined, an estimated 6.5 % [1] to as much as 43% [2 ] of the U.S. population has used some form of CAM. Until recently, the primary response of Federal, state, and local health care regulatory agencies to this phenomenon was to restrict access to and delivery of CAM services to protect the public from unproven and potentially dangerous treatments. Since the early 1990s, however, scientific evidence has begun to emerge suggesting that some CAM approaches and products, when used appropriately, can be beneficial for treating illness and promoting health. As this evidence is collected and disseminated to the wider health care community and the public, it should provide a reliable basis for making policy decisions that will facilitate the public's access to safe and effective CAM approaches and products. [The number of \"CAM approaches and products\" that are useful is minuscule. The number of bogus approaches and products marketed as \"CAM\" since the early 1990s is huge. The fundamental rule of consumer protection is that products should be proven safe and effective before marketing. Whether or not methods are labeled as \"CAM\" has no relevance. Federal laws need to be strengthened, not weakened.] The White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP) was established in March 2000 to address issues related to access and delivery of CAM, priorities for research, and the need for better education of consumers and health care professionals about CAM. The President's Executive Order No. 13147 establishing the Commission states that its primary task is to provide, through the Secretary of Health and Human Services, legislative and administrative recommendations for ensuring that public policy maximizes the potential benefits of CAM therapies to consumers. [Most of the Commissioners have a long history of promoting irrational and unscientific methods. The real purpose of the Commission was to promote such methods. The body of its final report does not identify or criticize a single method that is promoted as \"CAM.\" The only criticism is in the [minority report](minority.html) from two Commissioners who were horrified by the final report and had the courage to speak out.] Overview of the Commission's Mission and Activities Specifically, the Commission's mission is to address: - education and training of health care practitioners in CAM; - coordination of research to increase knowledge about CAM products; - provision of reliable and useful information on CAM to health care professions, and, - provision of guidance on the appropriate access to and delivery of CAM. To accomplish its mission, the 20-member Commission solicited expert testimony at its 10 meetings, which were held in various locations in and around Washington, D.C. between July 2000 and February 2002. At the WHCCAMP meetings, clinicians, researchers, medical educators, regulatory officials, policymakers, practitioners, and others were asked to provide recommendations regarding Federal policies related to CAM and documentation to support those recommendations. The Commission meetings were initially focused around four primary areas: - Coordinated research and development to increase knowledge of complementary and alternative medicine practices and interventions; - Access to, delivery of, and reimbursement for complementary and alternative medicine practices and interventions; - Training, education, certification, licensure, and accountability of health care practitioners in complementary and alternative medicine; and, - Availability of reliable and useful information on complementary and alternative medicine to health care professionals and the public. The Commission also solicited public testimony on these topics during its meetings as well as during a series of four Town Hall meetings held at various sites around the country. Overall, the Commission heard from approximately 1700 consumers, professional groups, societies, and health care organizations interested in Federal policies regarding CAM. Commissioners also visited several medical institutions and CAM clinics throughout the country to observe how CAM and conventional health care providers in integrated and collaborative care settings. During its deliberations, the Commission came to the conclusion that, in addition to the areas covered by the Executive Order, two other issues needed to be discussed and addressed in order to accomplish the four primary goals. The first is the need to evaluate the possible role of CAM approaches in supporting health and wellness. The second is the need for a centralized coordination of Federal efforts regarding CAM. The Commission also recognized early into the discussions of its charges that not only were the four topics very complex, but time and resources were inadequate to address these topics in as much depth as each topic needed. In developing recommendations, Commissioners divided into eight work groups formed around specific topics areas, e.g., education and training, research, information dissemination. Each Commissioner served on at least two work groups. The work groups' recommendations were presented to the whole Commission, discussed, and used as the basis for developing final recommendations. Guiding Principles of the Commission and Linkages with Other Health Care Reform Efforts Based on its mission and responsibilities, the Commission developed 10 principles to guide the process of making recommendations and to shape the recommendations themselves: - A wholeness orientation in health care delivery. Health involves all aspects of life-mind, body, spirit, environment \u2014 and high-quality health care must support care of the whole person. [This has been a guiding principle of good medical care for centuries. \"CAM\" practitioner have added nothing of value to this principle. In fact, \"CAM\" practititioners are far less likely to take individual differences into account. Many \"CAM\" practitioners treat nearly everyone they see the same way.] - Evidence of safety and efficacy. The Commission is committed to promoting the use of science and appropriate scientific methods to help identify safe and effective CAM services and products and to generate the evidence that will protect and promote the public health. [This falsely implies that many \"CAM\" services and products have been proven effective and that further research will find many more. It also fails to note that many chiropractors, naturopaths, and homeopaths strongly oppose proven public health measures such as vaccination and fluoridation.] - The healing capacity of the person. The person has a remarkable capacity for recovery and self-healing, and a major focus of health care is to support and promote this capacity. [The body's self-healing mechansims (e.g., homeostasis and immune responses) were discovered through scientific experimentation. \"CAM\" advocates have contributed nothing to this process. Although many of them claim to \"support and promote individual healting capacity,\" there is not a shred of scientific evidence that they do this. Chiropractors claim to promote heailng by manipulating the spine. Naturopaths claim to promote healing by \"detoxifying\" the body. Homeopaths claim to health by stimulating the patient's \"vital force.\" Acupuncturists claim to promote healing by balancing the flow of the patient's \"Chi.\" There isn't a shred of scientific evidence that these methods do any of these things or that the entities they describe actually exist.] - Respect for individuality. Every person is unique and has the right to health care that is appropriately responsive to him or her, respecting preferences and preserving dignity. [Properly interpreted, this has been a guiding principle of good medical care for centuries. \"CAM\" advocates have added nothing useful in this area.] - The right to choose treatment. Every person has the right to choose freely among safe and effective care or approaches, as well as among qualified practitioners who are accountable for their claims and actions and responsive to the person's needs. [This is a fundamental principle of consumer protection. Mentioning it in this context, however, falsely implies that most \"CAM\" practitioners are qulified and offer safe and effective care.] - An emphasis on health promotion and self-care. Good health care emphasizes self-care and early intervention for maintaining and promoting health. [This falsely implies that \"CAM\" advocates offer something special to promote health. Actually, the opposite is true. The most prestigious science-based organization working in this area is the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), which has evaluated more than 80 preventive interventions. Most \"CAM\" practitioners utilize very few of the recommended interventions. In fact, we suspect that the majority are not even aware that USPSTF exists.] - Partnerships as essential for integrated health care. Good health care requires teamwork among patients, health care practitioners (conventional and CAM), and researchers committed to creating optimal healing environments and to respecting the diversity of all health care traditions. [There is no reason to believe that most \"CAM\" practitioners offer anything of value as \"partners.\"] - Education as a fundamental health care service. Education about prevention, healthful lifestyles, and the power of self-healing should be made an integral part of the curricula of all health care professionals and should be made available to the public at all ages. [This fasely implies that \"CAM\" advocates have something unique and special to offer in health education. The concept of \"education in self-healing\" falsely implies that \"CAM\" methods can foster self-healing.] - Dissemination of comprehensive and timely information. The quality of health care can be enhanced by promoting efforts that thoroughly and thoughtfully examine the evidence on which CAM systems, practices, and products are based and make this evidence widely, rapidly, and easily available. [This falsely implies that a close look at \"CAM systems, practices, and products\" would demonstrate that they have great value.] - Integral public involvement. The input of informed consumers and other members of the public must be incorporated in setting priorities for health care, health care research, and in reaching policy decisions, including those related to CAM, within the public and private sectors. [This falsely implies that \"CAM\" methods have great value but do not receive sufficient publicity.] These Guiding Principles are remarkably consistent with the 10 rules for health care reform listed the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on ways to improve health care in the 21st century (see Appendix B). That report, [Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century](http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10027.html), found that the nation's health care industry has \"foundered\" in its ability to provide safe, high-quality care consistently to all Americans, but particularly to those with chronic conditions [3].The IOM report recommended that clinicians, health care organizations, and purchasers need to do a much better job of focusing on and improving care for common, chronic conditions such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and asthma, which are now the leading causes of disability and death in the United States and consume a substantial portion of health care resources. The IOM report also recommended some specific health care reforms, including better mechanisms for communication between patients and their health care providers, increased cooperation among clinicians, a significant expansion of the evidence base for care, improved safety, and improvements in the dissemination of health care information to patients. [The IOM report did not advocate or even discuss \"CAM\" practices.] The Commission's guiding principles also are consistent with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' most recent 10-year health objectives for the Nation. These objectives are embodied in the report Healthy People 2010: Understanding and Improving Health.4 The two overarching goals of Healthy People 2010 are to: 1) increase quality and years of healthy life, and 2) eliminate disparities in access to health care. Healthy People 2010 enumerates 28 focus areas to which these two overarching goals are to be applied. Among these 28 focus areas are several that are analogous to the Commission's Guiding Principles, including: - Access to quality health services - Educational and community based programs - Health communication - Medical product safety - Physical activity and fitness - Public health infrastructure Healthy People 2010's focus areas are especially directed toward improving access to and delivery of high-quality health care services for people with chronic, debilitating conditions, such as arthritis, cancer, back pain, and HIV infection. [Healthy People 2010 did not advocate or even discuss \"CAM\" practices.] As noted in subsequent chapters, individuals with these conditions are frequent users of CAM practitioners and practices. Thus, the Commission's focus on improving the quality of care for those with chronic conditions by increasing access to safe and effective CAM systems, approaches, and products, potentially could have a significant impact on Healthy People 2010's goals for these costly, debilitating conditions. Crossing the Quality Chasm and Healthy People 2010 emphasize better allocations and uses of existing conventional health care technologies and resources to address heath care reform. The report addresses ways in which resources and technologies that have not been part of the mainstream and that have not been applied to these problems on a large-scale basis may have a beneficial impact on reform of the health care delivery system and on the promotion of health and the prevention of illness. Commission Concerns In a group as diverse as the members of this Commission and a field as diverse as CAM, it is not surprising that areas of significant disagreement, particularly about tone and emphasis, remained to the end. [This description attempts to undercut the WHCCAMP [minority report](minority.html) by implying that its \"concerns\" were a minor matter and were appropriately considered. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Commission was not a \"diverse group.\" Its members were selected because they were perceived as staunch \"CAM\" advocates who could be counted upon to prodice a one-sided report. No outspoken critics were included. We suspect that this passage was added to the report in a last-minute attempt to pacify the Commisisoners who agreed with the minority report. Rumor has it that three Commissioners who agreed with the minory report did not sign it because this passage was added.] In particular, several Commissioners were concerned that the report needs to state even more clearly than it already does that most CAM interventions have not yet been scientifically studied and found to be either safe or effective. [These Commissioners were correct. The fact that only \"several\" Commissioners were \"concerned\" is further evidence that the Commission was stacked against science.] Some Commissioners suggest that because the Report makes so many recommendations about including CAM practices in a variety of areas, it may imply to some readers that more has been shown to be safe and effective than evidence yet indicates. Some Commissioners believe there is or may be an unstated ethos throughout the document that could be construed that many, if not most, CAM modalities are beneficial. [\"May imply\"? The implication screams from nearly every page of the report.] Adding the qualifiers \"safe and effective\" helps, but the fact that the report makes so many recommendations may imply that more have been shown to be safe and effective than evidence yet indicates. None of the Commissioners want the report to be interpreted in these ways. [What a flat lie! If the Commission wanted to avoid implying that, the report would have had to be completely rewritten and included considerable mention that many \"CAM\" practices are worthless.] Although most CAM modalities have not yet been proven to be safe and effective, it is likely that some of them eventually will be proven to be safe and effective, whereas others will not. [Another masterpiece of obfuscation. The proper perspective is that very few will prove effective and that many are already known not to work.] Thus, some Commissioners have agreed to many recommendations that they believe are premature in hopes that it may be useful to lay out a road map and context now to guide research and policy decisions over the next several years as more science and other information become available [The fact that many Commissioners have agreed to premature recommendations is further evidence of their extreme bias (and perhaps commercial interest.] The question is not, \"Should Americans be using complementary and alternative medicine modalities?\" as many \u2014 perhaps most \u2014 already are doing so. For the most part, however, they are making these choices in the absence of valid scientific information to guide them in making informed and intelligent choices. [Note carefully that the Commission does not suggest that use of unsubstantiated mthods be decreased. Rather, it goes on to suggest that the problem will be solved by spending more money on research to prove that \"CAM\" methods work as claimed.] Many of the commissioners agree with the editors of The New England Journal of Medicine who stated in 1998: \"There cannot be two kinds of medicine \u2014 conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted.\" [5] But this presumes that sufficient funding is available for rigorous testing. . [Nonsense. The basic reason that \"CAM\" methods are unsubstantiated is that most of them don't work. It does not take much money to do preliminary research that could indicate useful research directions. But the \"CAM\" community does very little of this and never concludes that anything doesn't work.] All the Commissioners believe that substantially more funding for CAM research is needed to help citizens understand the benefits and the liabilities of various CAM modalities and approaches, especially those that are already in widespread use and those that have the greatest potential for addressing the nation's most serious health care problems. They understand the limitations of science but also its power. They also know how difficult the obstacles can be in conducting good science. [Here the Commission gives lip service to the idea that \"CASM\" has liabilities. The biggest liability is that many \"CAM\" methods have a supernatural basis and make no sense at all. Yet only the minority report identifies any of these by name.] Good science can help sort out what is true from what is not, what works from what does not, for whom, and under what circumstances and which conditions. [Good science has already done much of this, but the Commission does not report a single negative finding.] Well-designed scientific research and demonstration projects can help to determine which CAM modalities and approaches are clinically effective and cost effective, as well as the mechanisms involved. Americans can then make more informed and intelligent decisions about their own health and well-being. [Note that the idea that research could also demonstrate lack of effectiveness or cost-effectiveness is deliberately omitted here.] Some modalities of conventional medicine are widely used and some are being reimbursed but have not been proven to be either medically effective or cost effective, and some have side-effects that may be more harmful than many CAM modalities. [This is not a valid comparison. The scientific comminity evaluates everything it does and, over time, is self-correcting and discards methods that do not meet appropriate standards. The \"CAM\" community is not self-correcting and does not abandon anything unless it becomes unmarketable.] However, the Commissioners believe and have repeatedly stated in this Report that our response should be to hold all systems of health and healing, including conventional and CAM, to the same rigorous standards of good science and health services research. Although the Commissioners support the provision of the most accurate information about the state of the science of all CAM modalities, they believe that it is premature to advocate the wide implementation and reimbursement of CAM modalities that are yet unproven. [This statement belies the fact that implementation of the Commission's recommendation would lead to enormous promotion of \"unproven\" methods by placing \"CAM\" advocates in a position to promote unproven methods through government agencies, medical teaching institutions, insurance programs and many other health-related channels.] Also, the Commission as a whole is concerned that the report, in using the term, CAM generically brings well established modalities under the same umbrella as those with little or no scientific evidence. [Note carefully that the report does not identify a single modality as unproven or irrational.] The report does its best to distinguish in its recommendations between those proven safe and effective, such as exercise, nutrition, and stress management, and those that are not. [This is dishonest, because exercise, nutrition, and legitimate stress management have been part of mainstream health care for decades. Or should we conclude from this list that no other CAM method has been substantiated?] But the Commission recognizes that this distinction may not always be completely clear. The Commissioners want to state in the Introduction the importance of this distinction and the role of research as the crucial instrument for determining what is safe and what is not, as well as what works and what does not. [Note carefully that the WHCCAMP report does not identify a single method or product that does not work.] Overview of Remainder of Report In addition to describing the use of CAM by people with chronic conditions, Chapter 2 also presents an overview of the recent history of CAM in this country, its current status, and its prospects for incorporation into the nation's health care system. Chapter 3 addresses the need for research coordination at the Federal level and with new directions and opportunities for CAM research. Chapter 4 covers issues surrounding the education and training of conventional and CAM health practitioners and ways to enhance communication and collaboration among them. Chapter 5 addresses the need for better approaches to developing and disseminating timely, accurate, and authoritative information on CAM, including dietary supplement labeling; the Federal Government's role in this process; and, strategies for promoting public-private ventures. Chapter 6 discusses access to and delivery of CAM practices and ways to facilitate this process, including licensing and regulation. Chapter 7 discusses the coverage of and reimbursement for CAM services and products by third-party payers, including the need for uniform coding strategies to make it easier for payers to reimburse for CAM services. Chapter 8 contains information and recommendations on issues related to the potential role of CAM in wellness and health promotion programs and strategies for advancing this process. Chapter 9 details the Commission's discussions and recommendations regarding the coordination of Federal CAM efforts. Finally, Chapter 10 contains lists all of the recommendations and action items contained in this report. References: - Druss BG and Rosenheck RA.

[Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD] Two years ago, in March 2000, the President and Congress responded to public demand and public need by creating the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. The Commission's mandate was to develop legislative and administrative recommendations that would help public policy maximize potential benefits, to consumers and American health care, of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies \u2014 chiropractic, acupuncture, massage, herbs, and nutritional and mind-body therapies, as well as a host of other approaches. Many of the 20 Presidentially appointed Commissioners are conventionally trained health professionals and others are trained purely as CAM practitioners. Several more are conventional health professionals who integrate complementary and alternative approaches into their work. The Commission also includes a number of academic physicians and health and mental health professionals who joined the Commission interested in, but not experts in, CAM approaches. There are, as well, several business executives and patient advocates. [This is intended to suggest that the Commission is composed of professionals who hold a reasonable and balanced view of the subject matter. Nothing could be much further from the truth. The Commission was deliberately stacked to ensure that the final report was promotional. Nearly all of the Commissioners are philosophically aligned and economically involved with the so-called \"CAM\" movement. Few knowledgeable critics were appointed.] Though the Commissioners came from these diverse backgrounds, all swiftly agreed that our responsibility was to ensure the safety of products and practices that had been, or might be, labeled \"CAM\", as well as to maximize potential benefits of these approaches for the public. [Despite this alleged goal, the Commission did not identify a single \"CAM\" method that is irrational, ineffective, or dangerous.] For 18 months we listened and read, in 14 meetings, the testimony of over 700 individuals and organizations and we read over 1,000 written submissions. Commission members discussed what we had heard in subcommittees and in full Commission meetings. All participated actively in these discussions and learned from one another, as well as from those who testified. In particular, I want to mention our friend and fellow Commissioner, William Fair, M.D., a world-renowned urologic surgeon, who contributed so much to this Report. Bill, who died two months before this Report was completed, reminded the Commission often about the value of this work and, particularly, about the importance of helping to prevent chronic illness by teaching children and young people the fundamentals of self-care. [Appropriate self-care is advocated by mainstream health professionals. \"CAM\" advocates have added nothing useful to this.] He taught all of us who knew him even more about how to live courageously and generously with life-threatening illness. The Report that follows, which has been prepared with the invaluable support of the Commission's Executive Director, Stephen Groft, Pharm.D., and the Commission staff, is a response to the public trust the Commission was given and to the questions we were asked by the President and Congress. At times there were differences of opinion among us about, for example, the proper balance between freedom of choice and regulation as well as the appropriate roles of the various CAM professions in the health care system. Thanks to the persistence and dedication of the Commissioners, we were able to resolve many aspects of these and other questions. Still others remain to be addressed by the appropriate Federal agencies, and by the task forces and advisory groups whose creation this Report recommends. We wrestled, as well, with other questions: What is the best way to discuss approaches like self-care and prevention that are very much a part of good conventional medicine as well as CAM? How to address the healing power of prayer and spirituality in the context of CAM when these are of such importance to so many Americans, whether or not they are using CAM, or conventional, approaches to cope with an illness. I believe the Report reflects our best response to the complexity of the questions raised, as well as the diverse nature of the Commission and of those who testified. This introductory \"Chairman's Vision\" represents my own reflections on our work. [The report fails to address the important issues raised by the [minority report](minority.html), which is why the minority report was issued.] Over the last 30 years, increasing numbers of Americans, particularly those with chronic and life-threatening illnesses, have begun to look for health care answers in complementary and alternative approaches. They are not turning their back on conventional medicine \u2014 it is, in fact, those who have had all the benefits of modern scientific medicine who have led the search \u2014 but they are very much aware of its limitations and side effects. They are exploring approaches that would complement this medicine \u2014 or in some cases, be alternatives to it. And, most often, they are exploring these approaches without valid scientific information to guide them. [This fails to point out that the majority of the approaches it refers to are worthless.] These people are looking for therapies that are both more helpful and less burdened by side effects. Many of them are searching for something else as well. They want more time with the professionals who will provide care for them \u2014 a sustained, healing partnership rather than a brief consultation, and an opportunity to participate in their own care as well as to \"follow doctor's orders\". [There is no published evidence that \"CAM\" practitioners spend more time with patients, form better relationships, or are less directive than conventional physicians.] Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, this White House Commission's Report addresses the hopes and concerns of the American people and the professionals who serve them. [The report fails to distinguish which hopes are realistic and which are not.] It acknowledges and respects the American people's use of a variety of approaches to health care and emphasizes the need to use the tools of biomedical research to assess the perspectives and findings of a worldwide spectrum of approaches, techniques and systems of healing. [This falsely implies that standard medical care is but one \"system\" among many \u2014 and that the other deserve equal consideration and respect no matter how loony they are.] This Report is grounded in the conviction that first-class scientific research on these approaches and well-designed demonstration projects \u2014 of the same high quality required for conventional approaches \u2014 is crucial to helping all Americans, and those who care for them, make the wisest healthcare decisions. [This conviction may further the ideologic and financial interests of Commission members. However, it should have been balanced by an effort to limit research into methods that are so irrational that studying them has no practical value.] The Report's vision is holistic. It is shaped by attention to the mind, body, and spirit of each person, and to the social and ecological world in which we all live. This perspective, which has also re-emerged over the last 30 years in Western medicine under the name \"biopsychosocial\", has long been the shaping principle of traditional systems of healing. [This \"tradition\" \u2014 paying attention to the patient as well as the disease \u2014 has been part of good medical care for centuries and has nothing to do with \"mathods marketed as \"CAM.\" In fact, many \"CAM methods are not individualized but are prescribed the same way for everyone.] The Commission's Report is also defined by an emphasis on the importance of each person participating in his or her own care, and moderated by the understanding that government has a responsibility to facilitate this process. [This approach was advocated long before \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" became household words.] The Report recommends, as the Institute of Medicine has also done, active participation of the public in all aspects of their care, including the development of new research agendas. [People can influence what is studied through contributions to charitable organizations that award research grants. The extent to which laypersons should be permitted to influence the award of government funds depends on how the process would work. A modest voice would probably be helpful. But it would not be helpful to enable quackery promoters to shape research agendas through massive letter-writing campaigns.] There is a powerful emphasis in the Report on the importance of good information as the basis for health care decision-making. [There is an equally notable failure to provide any information about methods that don't work.] It recognizes the American people's pressing need to know, with as much authority as possible, what works and for whom, in complementary and alternative, as well as conventional medicine. Again and again the Report makes recommendations \u2014 for more and more rigorous and relevant research and for the training of researchers \u2014 to facilitate this process. . [The report's research recommendations are based on the false assumption that many \"CAM\" mthods would be validated. The report failed to indicate what methods are so irrational that studying them would be a waste of money.] All Americans should have access to qualified and accountable practitioners and safe health care products. In this Report, there is an emphasis on the unique role the Federal government can take in making available and accessible the latest research findings; in ensuring the safety of products; in helping to assess the appropriate levels of training of various CAM practitioners and the evidence base for their practice; in evaluating the different ways that states are regulating CAM practitioners; and in facilitating dialogue among CAM and conventional providers, scientists and the public. The Report addresses as well the important leadership role that states can take in developing models for appropriate regulation of CAM practitioners and of conventional professionals who incorporate CAM approaches in their work. [All practitioners should be regulated the same way. Competent ones should be able to practice. Incompetent ones should not.] The Report's approach is pluralistic. The American people want their conventional healthcare practitioners to help them make wise decisions about whether to use complementary and alternative therapies \u2014 and which ones to use \u2014 and they want their CAM practitioners to be responsive and informed partners with their mainstream medical caregivers. The Report offers guidance for both the integration of complementary and alternative therapies that are safe and effective into conventional medicine, and for respectful collaboration and cooperation between conventional health professionals and those whose practices are shaped by other healing traditions. It looks forward to cross-fertilization among these disciplines in education and research as well as clinical care. . [The basic requirement for professional practice should be knowledge of scientifically sound practices. Self-identification or recognition as a \"CAM\" or \"conventional\" professional is irrelevant.] It seems to me that this Report is shaped by the Commission's particular concern for an aging population with an increasing incidence of chronic illness \u2014 for precisely those people who are among the most frequent users of CAM products and services. It makes clear that people with chronic illness and those who are dying need to have available approaches that can reduce their stress and suffering, approaches \u2014 including CAM therapies \u2014 that recognize the spiritual, as well as the physical and emotional dimensions of their lives. The Report also makes clear that those in the greatest need \u2014 including, most particularly, those with limited incomes - must have available the most accurate, up to date information about which techniques and products may help and which may harm, and which practitioners are basing their recommendations on solid research and which are not. These Americans and their families must be offered this information in easily accessible forms \u2014 from the Federal government, in the practitioner's office, and in pharmacies and health food stores, as well as on the Internet. [Health food stores are notoriously bad sources of advice, a situation that will never change.] There is an emphasis as well on the singular importance to the long-term health of the American people of approaches that prevent disease and promote health and wellness. Some of these approaches have been presented in government reports like Healthy People 2000 and 2010. Many of the principles and practices of CAM approaches are, like some of these more conventional health care practices, aimed at enhancing health and well-being, and promoting each person's capacity for self-healing. [Standard practices are standard and should not be labeled as \"CAM.\"] The Report highlights the opportunity that Federal agencies now have to evaluate the ways that safe and effective CAM therapies may be integrated into their ongoing efforts to promote health among all children and adults. [This falsely implies that many such practices exist.] It seems to me, that the intentions of the Commission members were to engage Americans to participate actively in their own care; to stimulate research that will fairly test promising new and ancient approaches; to fully inform all health professionals and the people they serve about what is, and is not, known about CAM therapies; to make sure safe and reliable products are available to all Americans; to expand all Americans' options for safe and effective care; and to promote the study of approaches that may save us all money as well as enhance our health and well being. My larger concern \u2014 and that of the Report - is not, of course, complementary and alternative therapies, but the health and wellness of all Americans. I believe that this Report helps create the foundation for a more comprehensive health care system, a system responsive to the unique needs of each person. [It would do nothing of the sort.] As research determines which approaches are safe and effective and for whom, as that information is widely disseminated, and as health care evolves, I expect that the words \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" will become far less important. We will be concerned then only with making what has been determined to be safe and beneficial as widely available as possible and with bringing the same rigorous but open-minded study to a new generation of approaches which we have not yet examined. [This falsely assumes that many safe and effective \"CAM\" interventions exist but are being overlooked. It also deliberately ignores consideration of unsafe and ineffective approaches marketes as \"CAM.\"] I look forward to a health care practice in which engaged and informed patients form healing partnerships with respectful and collaborative practitioners who are offering a wide range of safe and effective approaches, a health care practice in which all of us learn to take better care of ourselves and one another. [These are the standard goals of science-based public health and medical care.] I hope that this Commission's Report will help to provide a map that will guide Americans in making some next steps toward these goals. [Guidance requires information about what to avoid, which the Commission has deliberately ignored.] [WHCCAMP Analysis Index](00.html) ||| [Quackwatch Home Page](../../../index.html) This article posted on March 25 2002.

CAM includes the worldviews, theories, modalities, products, and practices associated with these systems and their use to treat illness and promote health and well-being. Although heterogeneous, the major CAM systems have many common characteristics, including a focus on individualizing treatments, treating the whole person, promoting self-care and self-healing, and recognizing the spiritual nature of each individual.

[Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD and Timothy N.

Although heterogeneous, the major CAM systems have many common characteristics, including a focus on individualizing treatments, treating the whole person, promoting self-care and self-healing, and recognizing the spiritual nature of each individual. [These are buzzwords used for marketing purposes. No studies have demonstrated that \"CAM\" practitioners actually do more than conventional practitioners to \"individualize treatments,\" \"treat the whole person,\" \"promote self-healing,\" or do more than conventional practitioners to \"recognize individual spirituality.\" In addition, many CAM systems have characteristics commonly found in mainstream health care, such as a focus on good nutrition and preventive practices. [\"CAM\" versions of nutrition and preventive care often include bogus diagnostic tests, inappropriate ecommendations for dietary supplements, and fad dietary strategies. In addition, large percentages of chiropractors, naturopaths, and various other \"CAM\" advocates do not recommend vaccination. \"CAM\" advocates have added almost nothing useful to mainstream nutrition or public health practices.] Unlike mainstream medicine, CAM often lacks or has only limited experimental and clinical study; however, scientific investigation of CAM is beginning to address this knowledge gap. Thus, boundaries between CAM and mainstream medicine, as well as among different CAM systems, are often blurred and are constantly changing. [This is a gross exaggeration. \"CAM\" research has produced almost nothing of value.] Examples of the health care systems, practices, and products typically classified as CAM in the United States are listed in Table 1. |Major Domains of CAM Examples Under Each Domain||Examples Under Each Domain| |Alternative health care systems||Ayurvedic medicine | Chiropractic Homeopathic medicine Native American medicine (e.g., sweat lodge, medicine wheel) Naturopathic medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine (e.g., acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine) |Mind-Body interventions||Meditation | Hypnosis Guided imagery Dance therapy Music therapy Art therapy Prayer and mental healing |Biological based therapies||Herbal therapies | Special diets (e.g. macrobiotics, extremely low-fat or high carbohydrate diets) Orthomolecular medicine (e.g., megavitamin therapy) Individual biological therapies (e.g., shark cartilage, bee pollen) |Therapeutic Massage, | Body Work, and Somatic Movement Therapies |Massage | Feldenkrais Alexander Method |Energy Therapies||Qigong | Reiki Therapeutic Touch |Bioelectromagnetics||Magnet therapy| Many of the CAM systems of health care listed in Table 1 have evolved from the collective clinical experiences of many practitioners over generations of practice, such as in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Others have evolved from the clinical experiences of a single practitioner or small groups of practitioners who have developed a particular intervention. [A few would be more properly described as part of conventional care. Some of are so irrational that further study is not needed to conclude that they should be abandoned.] Despite their diversity, there are some common threads that run among many traditional systems of health care as well as systems that have emerged more recently. These similarities include an emphasis on whole systems, the promotion of self-care and the stimulation of self-healing processes, the integration of mind and body, the spiritual nature of illness and healing, and the prevention of illness by enhancing the vital energy, or subtle forces, in the body [1]. [\"Promotion of self healing\" and \"enhancing vital energy\" are quack concepts that cannot be demonstrated.] Convergence of CAM and Mainstream Healthcare Some of the common threads that run through CAM health care systems also are part of mainstream, or conventional, health care. For example, conventional medicine has a long tradition of being concerned with preventing disease as evidenced by the development of programs for immunizations, healthier mothers and babies, family planning, safer and healthier foods, fluoridation of drinking water, control of infectious diseases, reducing deaths from heart disease and stroke, decreasing the use of tobacco products, and promoting motor vehicle safety and safer workplaces [2]. [The idea that \"CAM\" health care generally advocates a broad specturm of preventive and public health measures is a flat lie. Only about a third of chiropractors advocate immunization and two national chiropractic organizations strongly oppose it. Naturopaths do not generally support immunization and fluoridation. None \"CAM\" organizations has aggressively attacked the problem of tobacco use. Some \"CAM\" advocates promote concepts of \"safer foods\" that encourage consumers to waste money buying \"orgnically grown\" products.] Mainstream or conventional health care also has long-recognized that good nutrition and exercise are important components of a healthy lifestyle [3,4]. There also is a growing recognition within conventional health care that biopsychosocial and spiritual factors may play an important role in promoting health and preventing illness [5,6]. The difference between conventional and CAM health care systems in many of these areas, however, is one of emphasis. [No surveys have demonstrated that this assertion is true or that the lnutrition strategies advocated by \"CAM\" practitioners are valid. With respect to chiropractors, for example, many of their publications and continung education courses make false of improbable claims for a wide variety of dietary supplement products; but their publications and programs almost never contain information about dietary guidelines or cholesterol management.] In part, because of the many technological advances that have occurred in conventional health care over the years (see Recent History of CAM section, below), pharmacological, surgical, and other technological approaches have come to dominate conventional health care. While acknowledged, prevention and wellness promotion have been underemphasized. For example, according to a recent report by the Nutrition Education Consortium, the teaching of nutrition in medical schools and residency programs remains \"woefully inadequate,\" [7] and a survey by Cooksey et al. [8] found that most medical schools do not have faculty trained specifically in nutrition. As a result of this lack of training in nutrition in medical education, many practicing physicians are not adequately prepared to provide nutrition counseling to their patients. However, registered dieticians and clinical nutritionists are employed by hospitals and clinics. These are the specialists who are trained in this area and are well established in the conventional health care system. Because many CAM approaches often focus on prevention rather than cure [9], they have come to be identified with wellness and self-care. [Note that the citation for this highly questionable statement is a book written by WCCAMP's chairman, James S. Gordon.] This may be a reflection of history, as effective treatments for many of the infections and severe injuries that occurred were lacking. Traditional systems were better able to strengthen the individual and attempt to prevent disease than to treat many of the illnesses that killed millions even one hundred years ago. This is not to imply that CAM systems of health care are more effective than conventional health care in promoting health and preventing illness, as many have not been scientifically shown to prevent disease or promote health. [It is clearly intended to imply that \"CAM\" practitioners are doing more than maintstream practitioners.] The perception that conventional health care emphasizes high technology approaches to treating patients, while CAM health care emphasizes low technology approaches to promoting health and preventing disease, has led some to suggest that conventional and CAM health care may eventually converge to form a new health care system that integrates the best of each [10]. However, there are not only scientific, but also educational, regulatory, and political obstacles to integration of the two systems. [This falsely implies that \"CAM health care\" is a system. \"Integrated is merely another term for \"complementary.\"] Evolution of CAM Terminology As interest in and use of non-mainstream health care practices has evolved in this country over the past several decades, the terminology used to describe CAM systems, practices, and products has had to evolve accordingly. Rather than focus on what these \"other\" health care systems are not (i.e., \"unorthodox, \"unconventional,\" or \"unscientific\"), more recent terminology has begun to focus on what these systems are and how they might be used. [The new terminology, of course, is more deceptive.] For example, because many consumers appeared to be using unconventional health care practices as alternatives to conventional health care, the term \"alternative medicine\" was widely adopted in the United States and Europe in the later 1980s [11,12]. This perception, however, was largely dispelled by surveys in the early 1990's, which found that people were using the two systems of health care \u2014 mainstream and alternative \u2014 simultaneously [13,14]. [\"Alternative\" is not a system. It is a marketing term intended to make people believe that unproven methods are genuine alternatives. These surveys found that health care consumers were accessing a range of therapeutic and preventive options, both alternative and conventional, to essentially \"complement\" one another. [That phraseology is used to dignify the word \"complementary.\"] As a result, the term \"complementary medicine\" was widely adopted not long afterwards to describe systems of health care and individual therapies that people used as adjuncts to their conventional health care [15,16]. [As far as we can tell, the original suggested meaning was the use of both \"alternative\" and established methods, using the best of both. This did not actually describe what \"CAM\" practitioners did but enabled them to pretend that they offered something extra rather than something useless.] A more recent and detailed survey conducted by Astin [17] has found that, although many unconventional therapies were being used to complement mainstream medical care, some were being used instead of conventional medical care. These data suggested that the term \"complementary\" was only partially descriptive of what was occurring in the marketplace. To acknowledge this dichotomy, Congress adopted the phrase \"complementary and alternative medicine\" and applied it to the National Institutes of Health's National Center on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), when the Office of Alternative Medicine was elevated to the status of a coordinating research \"Center\" in 1999. Even this terminology is unsatisfactory to many because it does not reflect emerging models of health care that have arisen in the overlapping areas between these various systems. [This statement is meaningless because \"CAM\" is a hodgepodge, not a \"system.\"] Nor does it account for the fact that health care systems, practices, and products that are not widely accepted or readily available in one part of the United States may be fully accepted and easily available in another. Members of the Commission considered other terms, such as \"integrative health care,\" \" collaborative health care,\" \"comprehensive health care,\" and \"\"holistic health care,\" but chose to use the term \"complementary and alternative medicine\" because it is used in the President's Executive Order and is widely recognized by the media and in the scientific literature. To fully understand the complexities of CAM as well as its current relationship with conventional health care in this country, it is necessary to understand its recent history, its current status, and future prospects, including emerging models of integrative and collaborative care. Recent History of CAM in the United States The history of CAM in the U.S. is a long, complex story that has been shaped by scientific, economic, and social factors. A detailed rendering of this history is beyond the scope of this report. This section instead provides a brief overview of the more recent developments that have helped shape the present status of CAM in this country and its prospects for contributing to the health and well being of our nation. Early American health care consisted of an eclectic mix of systems. In fact, until the middle of the 19th century, the vast majority of primary medical care in this country was provided by botanical healers, midwives, chiropractors, homeopaths, and an assortment of other lay healers offering a variety herbs and nostrums for a range of illnesses [18-20]. This began to change in the latter part of the 19th century, however, with the development and validation of the germ theory and significant scientific advances in antiseptic techniques, anesthesia, and surgery. Beginning in the late 1800s and lasting until the early 20th century there also was a major revolution in medical education that helped scientific medicine evolve into the dominant health care system in this country. This revolution in medical education began with the publication of William Osler's (1847-1919) textbook, The Principles and Practice of Medicine in 1892, which brought diagnostic clarity to medical practice. By 1905 Osler's textbook was the primary medical textbook in the vast majority of U.S. medical schools [21]. This revolution culminated with the release of a report by Abraham Flexner in 1910 [22] that served to crystallize the educational reform movement. After the release of the Flexner report, many medical institutions that did not meet its standards were driven out of business or forced to implement significantly more rigorous training programs [21]. Schools for many unorthodox healing systems either ceased to exist or became marginalized [20]. The isolation and elaboration of life-saving hormones, sulfa drugs, and other antibiotics in the early and middle of the 20th century, conventional medicine cemented its place as the nation's preeminent form of health care in this country. Although most of the other health care systems and their therapies did not disappear, they were considered by most of the public and the mainstream medical community to be unscientific relics of the past. As a result, many were practiced in relative obscurity. With the reduced threat of infectious diseases and other acute illnesses, conventional medicine began turned its focus to the more complex and costly problems of chronic, degenerative illnesses. As a result of public health interventions developed earlier in the 20th century, people began living significantly longer. This gradual aging of the population began to significantly increase the prevalence of chronic conditions, such as arthritis, back pain, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and cancer, putting further pressure on conventional medicine to address these conditions. As the health care system developed more sophisticated means of diagnosing and managing chronic illnesses, the cost of health care began to rise dramatically. Between 1965 and 1975, national health care expenditures more than tripled, rising from just over $41 billion to nearly $130 billion. Although employers and government programs covered some of these increases, out-of-pocket expenditures more than doubled during this same period [23]. Since then costs have continued to rise, with national health care expenditures reaching more than $1.2 trillion in 2000, the latest year for which such figures are available, and they are expected to reach more than $2.6 trillion by 2010. It was during this time of increasing rates of chronic illness and escalating health care costs that medical pluralism began to reemerge in this country. This reemergence was spurred on by a number of overlapping and sometimes interrelated movements. [A major factor was the deveopment of television, which enabled promoters of quackery to reach large audiences.] Beginning in the 1950s, the whole foods and dietary supplement movements began to change Americans' view of food as not only something they needed to stay alive but also as potential therapeutic agents. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Americans were increasingly exposed to a variety of traditional health care systems from foreign and indigenous cultures, many of which dated back to antiquity [24]. New York Times writer James Reston's account of his emergency appendectomy in a Chinese hospital during then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's visit to China in 1971 was particularly influential in this process [25]. Reston's article described how his postoperative pain and discomfort were relieved by acupuncture and herbs. For most Americans, this was their first glimpse of Traditional Chinese Medicine and its potential uses. During this same period, the growing \"counterculture\" movement in America sparked a fascination with the religious and philosophical traditions of Asian cultures. Transcendental Meditation, which is derived from Hinduism, became widely known and practiced [25]. Meanwhile, there was a growing interest in indigenous health care traditions, such as Native American and Mexican-American health care practices, particularly their reliance on herbs and natural substances. This movement, in turn, led to a renewed interest in \"natural\" health care movements that had developed in this country in the 19th century but had been relegated to the background of the American health care landscape. The late 1970s saw the emergence of the holistic health care movement in this country. Holistic practice (holism comes from the Greek word \"holos\" or \"whole\") emphasized an attention to the whole person, including the physical, spiritual, psychological, and ecological dimensions of healing. Holistic health care incorporates practices and concepts of Eastern philosophy and diverse cultural traditions, including acupuncture and the use of herbs, massage, and relaxation techniques as well as conventional medical practices [26]. It gained its greatest following among nurses [27]. However, many physicians, particularly those in the new specialty of family medicine, also became interested in this movement. [The percentage of physicians who claimed to practice \"holistic medicine\" is probably less than 1%.] The American Holistic Medical and Nurses Associations were formed, large professional and public conferences held, and a number of holistic medical clinics and holistic health centers opened. The late 1970s and early 1980s also was a time when a variety of self-care movements emerged; they offered programs or sponsored events to help individuals and families increase wellness or reduce their risk of onset of illness through diet or lifestyle changes [28,29]. The years since then have been a particularly active time for the personal fitness movement, which increasingly is making use of the techniques of other systems of healing, such as yoga, tai chi, and massage [30]. [These are relaxation tchniques and have little or nothing to do with fitness.] The Current Status of CAM in the United States Today, use of CAM approaches and therapies is more prevalent in a number of patient populations in the Unites States, no matter how narrowly or broadly it is defined. Physicians, hospitals, and other conventional health care organizations also are showing a growing interest in CAM. Although such prevalence of use and interest in CAM is not an indication that these practices are effective, it does suggest that those with chronic conditions and the physicians who treat them are looking for more therapeutic options than are widely available in conventional health care settings. Indeed, for some chronic conditions, state-of-the-art conventional therapies have provided only modest gains. For example, according to a number of assessments over the years, expensive mainstream health care approaches to managing chronic lower back pain often have not been very effective [31-36]. This is perhaps why individuals with back pain are some of the most frequent users of CAM practices. [It would be more appropriate to say that many people undergo spinal manipulation for back pain.] Consumer Use of CAM Practices Because of the dramatic increase in the prevalence of chronic conditions, the past decade has witnessed an acceleration both in consumer interest in and use of CAM practices and/or products. Surveys indicate that those with the most serious and debilitating medical conditions, such as cancer, chronic pain, and HIV, tend to be the most frequent users of CAM practices. CAM usage also appears to be high among certain ethnic populations that have access to their traditional forms of healing. CAM and Cancer A survey that assessed both the prevalence and predictors of CAM use in a comprehensive cancer center population where all were using conventional therapies found that 63 percent had used at least one CAM approach other than a spiritual practice. Women with cancer were more likely to use CAM than men with cancer, and those patients who had surgery, chemotherapy, or both were more likely to use CAM than cancer patients who had neither [37]. Another survey of almost 2,000 tumor registry patients selected at random found that 75 percent had used at least one CAM modality.38 The most frequently used therapies among this group of cancer patients were nutritional approaches (63 percent), massage (53 percent), and herbs (44 percent). The most common reason patients gave for using CAM was to \"stimulate an immune response\" (73 percent). Breast cancer patients were significantly more likely to be consistent users of CAM therapies compared to patients with tumors in other sites areas of the body (84 percent versus 66 percent, respectively). The majority of cancer patients (63 percent) enrolled in clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health used at least one CAM therapy, with an average use of two therapies per person [39]. This same study found that the most frequently utilized therapies were spiritual approaches, relaxation, imagery, exercise, lifestyle, diet (e.g., macrobiotic, vegetarian), and nutritional supplementation therapies. Patients unanimously believed that these CAM treatments helped to improve their quality of life by helping them cope more effectively with stress, decreasing their discomforts related to treatment and the illness itself, and giving them a better sense of control. A similar pattern of CAM usage has been found among men with prostate cancer, with 42 percent of those surveyed using vitamins, prayer or religious practices, and herbs to treat their condition [40]. Most of the men in this survey did not report their use of CAM to their physicians. Most of these surveys included prayer and spirituality under CAM. Many people that attend churches, synagogues, or mosques or other religious entities do not believe that this is essential information for their physician and would not feel compelled to share this information with their physician. On the other hand, the use of botanicals and other dietary supplements during cancer treatment would be a concern if the physician were unaware that their patient was using these products. CAM and Chronic Pain A recent national survey by Astin [17] found that back problems were the most common medical condition (24 percent) for which people reported using CAM treatments. In this survey, neck problems also were associated with frequent use of CAM. Other studies have found that one-third of all patients suffering from back pain choose chiropractors over physicians to treat them, and that chiropractors provided 40 percent of primary care for back pain [41,42]. Moreover, these studies found that chiropractors retained a greater proportion of their patients (92 percent) for subsequent episodes of back pain care than did other providers. Similarly, Krauss and colleagues [43 ] found that CAM practitioners and products were chosen more often than conventional physicians and therapies by those persons with chronic pain (52 versus 34 percent) and headaches (51 versus 19 percent ), as well as by persons suffering from other associated maladies, including depression (34 versus 25 percent), anxiety (42 versus 13 percent), and insomnia (32 versus 16 percent). Surveys of rheumatology patients have found similarly high CAM utilization rates, ranging between 19 and 63 percent, depending on the type and severity of their condition [44]. Other studies have documented that people with painful chronic conditions, including arthritis and headache, and psychological problems (insomnia, depression, and anxiety) are frequent users of CAM therapies, particularly massage, chiropractic, and acupuncture [13,45]. CAM and HIV Infection A recent study of 1,675 HIV-positive men and women using CAM (usually in addition to conventional medication) found that the most frequently reported CAM substances were high doses of vitamin C (63 percent), multiple vitamin and mineral supplements (54 percent), vitamin E (53 percent), and garlic (53 percent).46 The health practitioners most commonly consulted were massage therapists (49 percent), acupuncturists (45 percent), and nutritionists (37 percent). The CAM activities most commonly used were aerobic exercise (63 percent), prayer (58 percent), massage (53 percent), and meditation (46 percent). The majority of this group of HIV-infected individuals consulted with both conventional and CAM providers and used both conventional and CAM medications simultaneously, yet few reported that their conventional and CAM providers worked as a team. Similar observations were made in a survey of 180 HIV-infected people [47]. This study found that almost half (45 percent) of this group had visited a CAM practitioner an average of 12 times per year, compared to only 7 visits per year to their conventional physician or nurse practitioner. More than two-thirds (68 percent) of the HIV-infected individuals in the study used herbs, vitamins, or dietary supplements. Eighty-one percent of those who used supplements said the remedies were \"extremely\" or \"quite a bit\" helpful. Approximately 24 percent reported using marijuana to treat weight loss, nausea, and vomiting in the previous year, and most (87 percent) said it was extremely or quite helpful. Ethnic Differences in CAM Usage In addition to the type and severity of illness one has, people's cultural and ethnic backgrounds can influence their propensity for using CAM. For example, surveys of CAM usage among Mexican-American and Hispanic populations have demonstrated that almost half of respondents have used a CAM practitioner one or more times during the previous year [48,49]. Herbal medicine, spiritual healing techniques, and traditional healers are used quite frequently by these groups. Similarly, surveys of Native American populations have found that they tend to have higher rates of CAM usage than the general U.S. population [50] and are also frequent users of herbal remedies, spiritual healing techniques, and traditional healers.51 Income, not belief systems, prohibits interaction with traditional healers by Native Americans [51]. Reasons People Give for Using CAM The reasons people seek out and use CAM practices are not fully understood. However, strong associations have been found between CAM usage and: 1) an interest in spirituality and personal growth, 2) a commitment to environmentalism, and 3) feminism [16]. In addition, several other studies have found that belief in a holistic approach to health, a strong internal locus of control, and transformational life experiences also are associated with CAM usage [17,52,53]. [The most likely reason that people seek \"CAM\" treatment is misleading publicity.] Although Astin's survey [17] found that only a small percentage (4.4 percent) of people used CAM therapies as alternatives to conventional practitioners and treatments, there is some evidence that they used CAM because they believed it is more effective than conventional medicine. For example, in the survey of rheumatology clinic patients mentioned above [54], 50 percent of respondents reported turning to CAM because they perceived their conventional treatment (drugs) as ineffective. Similarly, when researchers interviewed 113 patients at a family practice, the top reason given for to seeking CAM therapies was that patients believed they would work [54]. A similar study of primary care patients found that: 1) recommendations from friends or coworkers, 2) a desire to avoid the side effects of conventional treatments, and 3) failure of conventional treatments to cure a problem were the most frequently cited reasons for using CAM therapies [55]. In this study, use of practitioner-based CAM therapies was significantly and independently associated with patients' perceived poor health status and emotional functioning and a musculoskeletal disorder, usually low back pain. Patients who used CAM most commonly visited chiropractic (35 percent), used herbal remedies and supplements (27 percent), and sought massage therapy (17 percent). Use of self-care-based therapies was associated with high education and poor perceived general health compared to the previous year. Use of traditional folk remedies was associated with Hispanic ethnicity. Conventional Health Care's Interest in and Use of CAM Evidence suggests that a growing number of physicians already use some CAM practices and consider them safe and effective in offering them to their patients. A comprehensive review of 25 surveys of physician practices and beliefs regarding five commonly used CAM practices \u2014 acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, herbal medicine, and massage \u2014 found that about half of the surveyed physicians believed in the efficacy of these five CAM practices [56]. This study found that a significant proportion of conventional physicians were both referring patients to CAM practitioners and/or offering some of these CAM treatments in their practice. [This paragraph greatly exaggerates the significance of \"comprehensive reviuew.\" Only two of the 25 studies were done within the United States. One of these found very low beliefs, ranging from 49% favoring chiropractic to only 1% believing in homeopathy. The other survey took place at \"family practice\" seminar where many participants expressed interest and belief in the five practices. However, 27.2% of them said that they practiced chiropractic, which means that a many of the responders were not medical doctors but were chiropractors. Thus the published data were meaningless.] In addition, Pelletier and colleagues [57] found that a small, but growing number of insurance companies are offering or are considering coverage for CAM services. [The raw numbers are misleading, because \"CAM\" coverage is typically limited andx offered at extra cost.] CAM also has made significant inroads into conventional medical education, with more than two-thirds of mainstream medical schools currently offering elective courses in CAM or including CAM topics in required courses [58]. However, the acceptance of some CAM practices by the conventional health care community did not come without economic and political power struggles. [The \"power struggles\" did not lead to acceptance.] CAM practitioners have filed suit and won court cases against conventional health care professional associations [59], and in many states CAM professions have faced strong opposition from conventional health care organizations in gaining licensing from state regulatory agencies [60]. Evidence Base for CAM Surveys documenting the rise of interest in and use of CAM by consumers were a significant factor in the biomedical research community's decision to take a serious look at both the safety and efficacy of many CAM approaches and therapies. [Third refers to the establishement of the NIH Office of Unconventional Medicine, which evolved into the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Its establishment had nothing to do with any rise in consumer interest in \"CAM.\" It reasulted from persuading Senator Tom Harkin that the scientific research community was unfairly neglecting research on alleged cancer cures. Harkin has sufficient politcal clout to control legislation related to NIH funding. Harkin was also a key figure in establishing the WHCCAMP.] Federal expenditures for CAM research have risen dramatically since the early 1990s. To date, NCCAM has funded the establishment of 14 research centers to explore the safety and efficacy of a wide range of CAM therapies for a host of conditions. As a result of these and other international efforts, the evidence base for the efficacy a number of CAM approaches and treatments has grown significantly over the past decade. [Regardless of the size of this so-called evidence base, the number of \"CAM\" methods that have been proven safe, effective, and cost-effective is close to zero.] More research on CAM currently exists than is commonly recognized. In fact, the Cochrane Collaboration, an international effort to develop an evidence base for a wide variety of medical therapies, both allopathic and CAM, lists more than 4,000 randomized trials for various CAM therapies in its electronic library. [The number depends on what is included in one's definition of \"CAM.\"] Furthermore, a number of Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews of this worldwide research literature have identified the potential benefits [What is a \"potential\" benefit?] of CAM and related approaches and products for a small number of chronic conditions, including: - Low-fat or modified fat diets for preventing cardiovascular disease [61] - Acupuncture in the management of low back pain and recurrent headaches [62,63] - St John's Wort for treating mild to moderate depression [64] - Herbal and glucosamine therapy for treating osteoarthritis [65,66] - Nutritional supplements for several neurological conditions [67,68] In addition to these Cochrane systematic reviews, an NIH scientific review panel concluded that acupuncture is a plausible option for treating several conditions, including nausea associated with chemotherapy and anesthesia, acute dental pain, headaches, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, fibromyalgia, and depression [69]. [That panel, like this Commission, was stacked with advocates who wrote a loosely worded and poorly reasoned report. Its exact words were that \"acupuncture may be useful. . . .\"] Another NIH review panel concluded that that mind-body techniques, such as meditation and guided imagery, are effective both in the management of painful conditions and the relief of stress and anxiety [70]. All of these literature reviews have concluded that larger, more rigorous studies are needed before definitive statements can be made about the benefits of these therapies. [This seems to be the standard conclusion whenever \"CAM\" research is done.] These data, nevertheless, point to the need for a comprehensive and aggressive research program in several areas of CAM, particularly those areas where CAM practices and products are frequently used adjunctively to mainstream medical care [71]. [Research priorities should be based on the likelhood of useful results, not where methods are popular.] The interaction of conventional and CAM health care systems over the years has made such a research program possible by producing significant improvements in CAM research methodology and data collection [72]. Conventional health care, in turn, has used these improved research methods to examine some CAM practices, found similarities between their practices and CAM practices, and has begun including them in comprehensive care programs [20]. [This statement is false and is not supported by reference #20, whicb says nothing whatsoever about conventional health care including CAM practices in comprehenive care programs.] Safety Issues with CAM Use Despite the promising evidence that some CAM practices may be effective in managing and treating certain chronic conditions, most CAM therapies that are currently being used by consumers have not been studied adequately in regard to either efficacy or safety [73,74]. Even when evidence indicates that a particular CAM approach or modality is safe and effective for a particular condition, new safety concerns may arise when it is used in conjunction with conventional medications, which is the way most consumers use CAM. Even when evidence indicates that a particular CAM approach is safe and effective for a certain condition, new safety concerns may arise when it is used in conjunction with conventional medications, which is the way most consumers use them. A recent review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that some commonly used herbal products can cause serious complications for surgery patients [75]. The potential complications included bleeding, cardiovascular instability, hypoglycemia, and there was evidence that some herbs may increase the strength of anesthetics or the metabolism of many drugs used during and after surgery. The potential adverse interaction of CAM and conventional treatments is particularly troubling to public health officials because most people do not tell their conventional health care providers that they are using CAM services or products. [Even if they did, there is little reason to believe that they would be safer.] A survey of health food stores customers found that although these CAM consumers welcomed a partnership with their physicians, they generally believed that physicians in general were closed-minded and had little knowledge about dietary supplements [54]. [Distrust of the medical profession is probably higher among people who shop in health food store sthan among those who do not.] These consumers had decided to assess the effectiveness of dietary supplements through personal study and subjective experimentation and not discuss this experimentation with their doctors. A similar lack of communication regarding CAM has been found between cancer patients and their physicians. For example, in a survey of women with breast cancer, Adler and Fosket [76] found that the majority of respondents (55 to 85 percent) used CAM therapies but did not divulge this use to their physicians because they assumed the physicians would not be interested, would respond negatively, would not understand, or would dominate the conversation due to assumed disinterest. Another survey found that physicians were unaware of CAM usage by the majority (57 percent) of their patients [77]. These studies suggest that physicians and patients must become more knowledgeable about the potential benefits and harms of CAM approaches and treatments, and physicians and other conventional health professionals must make significant efforts to open the lines of communication with their patients about their use of CAM approaches and products. Recently, a major effort has been made to increase conventional physicians' awareness and understanding of CAM through educational programs. However, there is a great deal of variability in the content of these programs [58]. [Reference #58 refers to courses taught to medical students. The vast majority of these courses are of low-quality.] Although a few provide detailed information on potential CAM benefits and safety issues, most are too general in content to provide physicians with the knowledge base they need to feel more comfortable about the subject and to display a willingness to discuss CAM issues with their patients. [In other words, most of the \"CAM\" courses taught at medical schools are worthless.] Concerns about the safety of CAM products and their interaction take place in the context of the larger public attention to the side effects and problems accompanying all medical treatment [78]. Future Prospects of CAM Despite the increasing use and acceptance of CAM and emerging evidence supporting efficacy of some CAM approaches and therapies, it is difficult to predict whether many CAM systems and practices will ever be fully integrated into the conventional health care system. Although a significantly greater degree of cooperation between specific CAM and conventional health care approaches and practitioners in the future, how well they can integrate their practices depends to a great measure on the establishment of an evidence-base for safety and effectiveness of CAM approaches as well as the success of a variety of ongoing pilot programs to test the efficacy and feasibility of integrative and collaborative models of CAM and conventional health care delivery. Models of Integration Over the past few years, a growing number of hospitals, major academic medical centers, managed care companies, and insurance carriers have become interested in integrating some aspects of CAM into their operations. [The primaty driving force has been economic rather than scientific.] According to the American Hospital Association [79], nearly 16 percent of America's community hospitals offered CAM services in 2000, up from about 11 percent in 1999. Furthermore, many major medical centers, particularly comprehensive care cancer centers such as M. D. Anderson in Houston, Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center and Columbia -Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, have begun integrating CAM services into all of their patient care [80]. [We doubt that \"CAM\" services are part of \"all\" patient care.] However, the development of integrative health care is still in its early stages and faces a number of challenges. Many of these approaches are still without an adequate scientific basis. [No, most of these practices have no scientific basis.] Even where there is evidence of benefit, the delivery of CAM in a conventional health care setting often requires significant reconfigurations of the way both the conventional and CAM health care services are structured, conceptualized, and delivered [82.83]. Another significant challenge facing integration is many CAM practitioners' belief that they would have to dramatically alter or water down their approach to practice in order to adapt to a physician-dominated system. Some CAM professions would prefer not to integrate if it means giving up their identity and independence [20]. Models of Collaboration Another model that is being tested in a number of conventional academic and CAM health care centers is collaborative model rather than an integrative one. This model does not require full integration of services but instead is based on conventional and CAM practitioners referring patients to one another within a clinic or network. The models that are currently being pilot tested range from having conventional and CAM practitioners working side-by-side as equals, collaborating both in the diagnosis and treatment of patient conditions [10], to having to physician-centered models, where CAM practitioners provide services independently but under the supervision of a primary or a specialty care physician [83]. These models, however, reveal additional challenges, which are listed below. Meeting Challenges As noted, many of these integrative and collaborative programs are in their infancy. As they grow and develop, they face a number of challenges, including addressing: - Difficulties in communicating and significant differences in worldviews and methods of diagnosing and treating illness and promoting health; - Certification and training standards for some CAM professions; - Insurance reimbursement for safe and effective CAM practices; - Appropriate research models; - Comprehensive information on CAM for both the lay public and health care practitioners; and, - Appropriate education of both conventional and CAM professionals about each other's disciplines at all stages of their training. [This falsely assumes that closer association would lead to greater acceptence of \"CAM practices.\" In the following chapters, the Commission discusses these and other challenges in depth and recommends strategies for addressing them at the national and state level. The ways in which individual practitioners and programs meet these challenges will help to shape the future of CAM practice and determine the access people have to CAM services.

The article contributed significantly to the recent explosion of interest in \"alternative medicine\" in the United States. The paper reports a telephone poll of 1539 people on their use of \"unconventional\" methods on the previous year. Until that time quackery and medical pseudoscience practices existed in a fringe subculture. This began to change around the time of this article's appearance and the report has become one of the most frequently cited articles in the medical literature. The lead author was David M Eisenberg, MD, whose chief publication up until this time had been a popular book on the wonders of traditional Chinese medicine entitled Encounters With Qi. The article began by acknowledging the difficulty of defining \"unconventional, alternative, or unorthodox therapies,\" referring to \"medical practices that are not in conformity with the standards of the medical community.\" This is a fairly satisfactory definition of \"alternative medicine\" if \"the standards of the medical community\" are understood to include methods that are truly effective or which are under appropriate and well-designed scientific investigation. But the Eisenberg article settled on a definition of \"unconventional medicine\" being those \"medical interventions not taught widely at U.S. medical schools or generally available at U.S. hospitals.\" It addressed the question of how widespread these methods are and how much money is spent on them in relation to medical care that is more or less in conformity with medical and scientific standards. The 1539 people interviewed were a subset of 2295 respondents who agreed to participate and actually finished the interview. The 2295 people were, in turn, found by calling 5158 telephone numbers and excluding more than half of them because they were not working, were \"not assigned to households,\" did not speak English, or were cognitively or physically impaired. But for the sake of argument and brevity, my comments leave aside the implications of these facts - that the survey was not representative of the population. The telephone polling began by asking respondents about 24 medical conditions. Only 8% of respondents offered other \"important conditions.\" The ten most frequently reported medical conditions listed by the Eisenberg survey are shown in Table 1 with, for comparison, figures from the Centers for Disease Control's Vital and Health Statistics, Prevalence of Selected Chronic Conditions 1990-92. |Medical Condition||From Table 3 of | Eisenberg Article. |CDC Vital and Health Statistics, Prevalence of Selected Chronic Conditions |\"Back |Chronic bronchitis||5.2%| The Eisenberg survey also asked about dizziness, diabetes, and cancer, but the rates of these disorders and 11 others that the 1539 respondents were asked about were not given in the article. Presumably they were less than 8%, although, as is shown, hearing problems, skin conditions, and heart disease in the general population are in this range of prevalence according to the CDC. Deafness, of course, was the condition that D.D. Palmer \"cured\" when he \"discovered\" chiropractic more than a hundred years ago. Notably absent from Eisenberg's data were common ailments such as colds, cough, and flu. Neither was there mention of obstetric or gynecologic disorders, which are probably the most common medical problems of reproductive aged women. Among women aged 18-44, for example, roughly the range in which Eisenberg reported the highest rate of use of \"unconventional medicine,\" the CDC reported the prevalence of menstrual disorders as 2.8%, bladder infections 1.4%, kidney infections 1%, and other disorders of the female genital tract at 3%. Taken together as genitourinary problems, and including pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications, these would almost surely total 8% or more. Yet they appear to have been excluded. Also absent was obesity, which is notable because commercial weight loss centers were included in \"unconventional medicine\" methods and were used by more respondents than the majority of other methods. As one of a variety of chronic medical conditions that has proven extraordinarily resistant to successful management by any means, obesity has been and continues to be a prime target for \"alternative medicine\" promoters. Its absence here is inexplicable. When the survey respondents were asked about their use of \"unconventional medicine\" and whether or not they had seen a practitioner or \"provider\" of same, the answers broke down as shown in Table 2. |Type of Therapy||Used in Past 12 Months (%)||Saw a provider | (% of those exercise and prayer)||34||36| \"In the case of prayer, we thought [additional] questions would be inappropriate. As for exercise, we thought the term was too vague and the practice sufficiently ubiquitous to preclude the gathering of useful data.\" [from \"The Interview\" section of Eisenberg et al, 1993] The survey did not include some common aberrant methods, and included ones that did not fit the report's own definition. Among those not mentioned were chelation therapy (for atherosclerosis), antineoplastons, iridology, reflexology, aromatherapy, crystal therapy, kinesiology, magnets, acids and other non-herb \"nutritional supplements\" consisting of biochemical precursors, co-factors, and intermediates, Maharishi Medicine (previously known as Ayurveda), naturopathy, urine-drinking, bee pollen, royal jelly, snake venom, colloidal silver, colonics, light therapy, and ozone therapy. All of these methods and others continue to receive credulous media attention, are widely promoted, and have attracted outspoken and devoted advocates. Their absence from the list raises questions of completeness and of representation of the \"alternative\" field. Perhaps their use fell below the level of detection, but if so, that makes the \"34%\" use of \"alternative methods\" to be made up of other methods, perhaps not at all unconventional. Turning to the listed items, hypnosis, while only 1%, was included in \"unconventional medicine.\" Yet hypnosis is an accepted adjunct to medical science in appropriate circumstances. It is taught at many U.S. medical schools and psychiatry residencies. Biofeedback, despite lack of firm effectiveness, retains a similar position. Although chiropractic was listed as the second most commonly used method, the study did not distinguish it from manipulative therapy, used by some osteopathic physicians and physical therapists. Some respondents may have experienced \"chiropractic \" in those forms. The study did not look at these important distinctions in order to distinguish, say, hypnosis used for pain control from use in past-life regression or to recall alien abduction experiences, or medical manipulation for joint mobilization from chiropractic treatment of childhood ear infections and learning disabilities. The following statement explained about the methods reported in the survey: \"We did not ask whether the respondents' providers of unconventional therapy were medical doctors.\" So, conceivably, some \"chiropractic\" was administered by physical therapists and D.O.'s. Some, or possibly all \"biofeedback\" took place at medical clinics specializing in pain management. And \"megavitamin therapy\" might include niacin for hypercholesterolemia and other standard pharmacologic applications of vitamins. In the case of chiropractic there is another curious anomaly. Fully 30% of those who said they used chiropractic in the previous 12 months apparently did so without benefit of a chiropractor. The authors acknowledge that \"Some forms of unconventional therapy typically involve a provider (for example, a chiropractor or acupuncturist).\" But there is no attempt to explain or account either for the 30% of chiropractic use that people were practicing on themselves or the more curious finding that 9% of users of acupuncture had apparently been practicing on themselves. Or do these inconsistencies suggest another form of massage? Again, \"Some users of unconventional therapy may visit a provider less often than once a year but may continue to use the prescribed unconventional therapy.\" Was this the case only with imagery, \"spiritual healing,\" and commercial weight loss programs, or also with a third of those who said they had used chiropractic and nearly a tenth of those who said they had used acupuncture? The most-used \"unconventional medicine\" was \"relaxation techniques.\" It was among the most-used methods for all of the ten top medical conditions considered besides \"back problems\" and allergies, as shown in Table 3. |Of Those with||\"Unconventional Medicine\" use in the just what are \"relaxation techniques?\" Medical school graduates, as well as professionals in hospitals would agree that the idea of physical, mental, and emotional rest are components of good medical care. What is \"massage?\" It is a universal practice, when people injure themselves reflexively resort to \"massage\" the area. It would be difficult, given this, to find anyone who does not utilize \"unconventional medicine.\" The authors recognized this problem, saying: \"Some of the unconventional therapies studied warrant further clarification. For example, 'massage therapy' or 'relaxation therapy' may mean different things to different people.\" But, again, this was stated only in the small print, not to be found in interpretation and discussion of results. \"Spiritual healing\" certainly means different things to different people as well. To most it means a healing ceremony of some sort, usually with a group. But is it also \"spiritual healing\" when a Catholic priest comes to the hospital bed to administer a sacrament? Or when anyone says a religious prayer? These practices are not taught in medical schools, but it seems doubtful that this deserves to be considered as \"unconventional medicine.\" Likewise, the use of \"imagery,\" especially in the management of insomnia and anxiety, is so customary that it is a clich\u00e9 to speak of counting sheep to bring on drowsiness or imagining one's audience to be naked in order to allay stage fright. But most, if not all of these qualifications, and omissions of distinctions had the cumulative effect of maximizing the numbers of survey respondents who could be said to have used \"unconventional medicine.\" This, in turn, was used to support similarly magnified extrapolations of the use and economic impact of \"unconventional medicine.\" So, for example, the Eisenberg report stated: The estimated number of ambulatory visits to providers of unconventional therapy in 1990 was 425 million. This number exceeds the estimated 388 million visits in 1990 to all primary care physicians (general and family practitioners, pediatricians, and specialists in internal medicine) combined. But these \"providers\" included masseurs and masseuses who make no claims of curing any diseases, commercial weight loss methods, and self-help group meetings. And they might have included many physicians or people who working in conjunction with physicians, delivering appropriate care in conformity with medical scientific standards. Or perhaps they were not included. It is not possible to know from the data presented. The article compares \"alternative\" visits to those to general and family practitioners, pediatricians, and internists. As before, there is no mention of obstetrics and gynecology, even though it is well-known that many women depend on their Ob/Gyn physicians as their primary doctors, or to other medical specialists who might serve as primary physicians. Considering the prevalence of \"back problems,\" allergies, and anxiety and depression, why not include the annual number of visits to orthopedists, physiatrists, physical therapists, allergists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers? By including some practitioners and excluding others, the authors are able to pick their way to justifying their major conclusion that, \"unconventional medicine has an enormous presence in the U.S. health care system.\" The authors go on with their finding that \"fewer than 3 in 10 users of unconventional therapy mention its use to their medical doctors,\" ignoring the fact that some of this \"unconventional medicine\" may even have been supplied by or at the recommendation of medical doctors. Moreover, the importance of visits to \"unconventionals\" is variable. A physician may not attach much importance to whether a patient had a massage, attended a Weight Watchers' meeting, or even seen a chiropractor in the previous 12 months. No one study is expected to answer all questions about an investigated matter. But what would be useful to know is how many people, given a serious diagnosis by a physician, seek out acupuncture, homeopathy, or a brown rice diet in lieu of appropriate medical or surgical treatment, or use substances that interfere with prescribed drugs? How many unnecessarily use ineffective methods for disorders that are self-limited? \"Roughly half of those who use unconventional medicine for their principal medical conditions have no supervision of this treatment by either a medical doctor or a provider of unconventional therapy.\" But, again, what is the significance of someone's using \"relaxation techniques\" or imagery in an unsupervised setting? \"The use of unconventional therapy,\" they warned, \"especially if it is totally unsupervised, may be harmful.\" But what is this harm? Are the 30% of people who use chiropractic on their own more liable to injure themselves than are chiropractors to injure the other 70% of those who use this form of \"unconventional medicine?\" Would it be safer for people having a massage, or attending a self-help group? What may truly be harmful where these methods are concerned, is their substitution for proved measures in the setting of serious or potentially serious medical conditions. Two references were given by the authors in support of the idea that their data show a risk to the public of unsupervised \"unconventional medicine.\" One was the 1984 report of the U.S. Congress' Subcommittee on Long-Term Health and Aging, Quackery: a $10 Billion Scandal, known as the Pepper Report for the late chair of that committee, Claude Pepper. The other is the 1987 report of the Department of Health and Human Services' Health, Information and the use of Questionable Treatment: A Study of the American Public. The adverse effects noted in these sources are primarily from methods \u2014 herbs \u2014 that this article's data indicate were used by only a small minority of their respondents. They also found evidence of harm caused by delay or forgoing of appropriate medical treatment because of the substitution of unproved and ineffective therapies that are deceptively promoted. The present study did not mention those problems. The present report suggested that \"medical doctors should begin to ask patients about their use of unconventional therapy whenever they take a history.\" Yet delay seeking medical care may arise from \"spiritual healing\" and \"prayer\" as from other \"unconventional medicine.\" Yet the authors declined to ask patients details about about these two methods because it \"would be inappropriate.\" The major problem of the original survey was its exaggeration of the prevalence of questionable, unproven, disproven, and irrational health and nutrition use. The conclusions put forward in this article have been reported repeated since its publication. This has especially taken the form of a subtle term-switching device in which the curious and rather idiosyncratic \"unconventional medicine\" was converted to the authors' definition of \"alternative medicine\". The authors have not hesitated to use such language distortion. Dr. Eisenberg has argued strenuously that his data show the need for physicians to cooperate with their patients' use of whatever \"alternative medicine\" that they may find appealing. On September 9, 1997, for example, the University of Texas-Southwestern and the Alternative Medicine Research Foundation of Texas sponsored a CME conference in Dallas. Dr. Eisenberg was the keynote speaker, and he used his time to review his 1990 data. He admitted that much of the \"unconventional medicine\" considered in the survey was essentially \"extended self-care.\" He then, without further explanation, began referring to \"alternative medicine\" and focused on herbs, acupuncture, and homeopathy. There was no discussion of \"relaxation techniques,\" which accounted for the largest use of \"unconventional medicine\" in his 1993 article. There was no consideration of chiropractic, massage, imagery, or \"spiritual healing\" or of commercial weight-loss programs. Dr. Eisenberg, at this same conference in 1997, ridiculed critics of homeopathy as having taken the position that, \"it can't work, so it doesn't work?\" This paper was presented at the \"Science Meets Alternative Medicine\" conference sponsored by the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine in Philadelphia on February 27th of 1999. At that time, one commentator suggested that Dr. Eisenberg could hardly help how others might misinterpret his work. But in September of 1998 Dr. Eisenberg was a co-author of another article that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA 280:784-787]. The second sentence of that report stated: We have known for several years that approximately 1 in 3 adults in the United States uses chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy, or one of many other treatment modalities. The reference for this fact being \"known,\" of course, was the 1993 NEJM article. Fortunately, this deception did not appear in Dr. Eisenberg's follow up survey, a report of which appeared last November in JAMA. But in this updated report building on the 1990 data, there was no pretense about \"unconventional medicine.\" Non-rational methods were referred to as \"alternative medicine\" throughout. There was also, this time, an acknowledgement that there are \"more alternative\" and \"less alternative\" therapies among those considered in both the 1990 data and in the follow-up survey of 2055 respondents in 1997. But there was no attempt to sort out which therapies were \"more alternative\" or \"less alternative.\" There was no consideration given to what distinguishes \"more alternative\" from \"less alternative\" therapies. There was no attempt to identify whether a particular application of a therapy was consistent with facts and reason or not. The principal data presented in the follow-up survey are shown in Table 4. |Type of Therapy||Used in past 12 more therapy (excluding | exercise and prayer) |33.8||42.1 | * P .05; P .01; P .001 Many of the same problems of the 1993 article apply to this updated survey. For example, relaxation therapy and massage have still not been clarified, although this was said to be warranted five years previously in the 1993 paper. On the whole, the 1998 article is slightly less polemical that that of 1993. Given the promotional success of the earlier report, perhaps there was no need to be more emphatic. In 1998 it is merely stated that, \"the prevalence and expenditures associated with alternative medical therapies in the United States have increased substantially,\" and that, \"the magnitude of the demand for alternative therapy is noteworthy.\" Eisenberg and his co-authors do not speculate on why this is so, but express a sort of uncomprehending interest in their findings, \"in light of the relatively low rates of insurance coverage for these services.\" They do speculate that increased insurance coverage of \"alternative medicine\" would almost surely further increase its use. But they do not address the question of whether the increased use of \"alternative medicine\" since the 1990 survey has had any health benefits. On the contrary, they draw proper attention to the hazards of adverse effects, particularly in the elderly and infirm. But their data are of no help in assessing this very serious risk and no suggestions for addressing it are offered. Elsewhere, Dr. Eisenberg has suggested that physicians \"supervise\" their patients' use of \"alternative medicine\" and even co-manage their care with \"alternative medicine\" practitioners. But even in the updated 1998 survey report, Eisenberg and his collaborators do not suggest that physicians make an attempt to educate their patients or try to discourage or curtail their use of unproven and ineffective methods. Most concerning is absence of comment on major driving force behind alternative medicine - relaxed regulatory environment of the marketplace. The 1998 report mistakenly assumes \"alternative\" medicine use reflects demand for it and/or dissatisfaction with biomedical care. Two years after the collection of the Eisenberg's original survey data, Congress appropriated funds for what was to become the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM). The impetus was the will of one senator, Harkin of Iowa who used his committee chairmanship to appropriate funds because of his personal belief in bee pollen and other ineffective remedies. OAM has now been upgraded with increased funding to the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. A year after the 1993 NEJM report, the [Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)](https://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html) freed the health food industry from much of the regulatory oversight of the FDA. An avalanche of uncritical media coverage of unproved claims and practices followed. A swell of advertising dollars poured into the print and electronic media. This was a potent, and not coincidental combination. Ideologically motivated private foundations such as the $300 million Fetzer Foundation had poured millions of dollars into medical school courses and research, had sponsored the Bill Moyers' PBS series \"Healing and the Mind,\" sponsored the Eisenberg study plus his Harvard Medical School course and annual post-graduate courses for physicians and other health professionals. These and the first Eisenberg paper itself acted to create a perception that \"alternative medicine\" is safe, effective, and at least as good, if not better than, scientific biomedicine. The authors did not comment on the fact that use of acupuncturists, homeopaths, and chiropractors remained stable over the ten years, while the \"alternative medicine\" that drew the greatest increase in use, more than tripling between 1990 and 1997 were over-the-counter herbal medicine, folk remedies, and homeopathic products, all of which have been aggressively mass-marketed in the wake of DSHEA. Major manufacturers are rolling out herbal and homeopathic versions of their established trade-named products. Vitamin sales lagged by comparison, having been previously marketed maximally for years. On the other hand, many \"nutritional supplements\" combine herbs, vitamins, as well as additional ingredients and may claim to be homeopathic as well. Thus, someone's purchasing a single over-the-counter \"nutritional supplement\" of this kind would contribute to an increased prevalence of use of several different forms of \"alternative medicine.\" In 1996, under pressure from organized acupuncturists, the FDA reclassified acupuncture needles as Class II \"medical devices,\" which permitted their use and associated claims of various health benefits. In 1997 the OAM, in association with its former interim Director, carefully orchestrated a seemingly biased panel that issued a consensus statement in favor of acupuncture. The 1998 Eisenberg article mentioned none of these things, while marveling at the public's alleged demand for \"alternative medicine.\" The impression remains that acupuncture and \"natural\" products are safe, effective, and even constitute \"cutting edge\" medical science. Eisenberg is silent on how these factors may have affected his updated survey information of 1997. Yet they are crucial to any evaluation. Manufacturers are now selling products which are, for all intents and purposes, medications. But, legally, as \"nutritional supplements,\" they are \"foods.\" Even food products are now appearing which contain herbal ingredients, such as soup containing Saint John's Wort and corn chips laced with kava. Any serious discussion of the prevalence, let alone the medical and public health implications of \"alternative medicine\" will be non-productive until and unless their terminology is clarified. For if \"unconventional\" medicine cannot be distinguished from \"alternative medicine,\" \"complementary medicine,\" \"integrative medicine,\" and quackery, then there will be nothing left to call quackery or illegal promotion. Likewise, if medicine cannot be distinguished from exercise, prayer, relaxation, self-help practices, and other \"extended self-care,\" then there will be nothing left that will not be medicine. These issues are important not only scientifically, but also in the social, cultural, and economic context of continued medical scientific progress amid rising medical care costs. Unfortunately, Dr. Eisenberg, his collaborators, the lay and medical press and other commentators have been obscuring rather than clarifying, hindering instead of helping, honest efforts to confront them. ________________________ Dr. Gorski practices obstetrics and gynecology in Arlington, Texas, and is president of the Greater Dallas-Fort Worth Council Against Health Fraud.

The National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF) wants the Bush Administration to reject the final report of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP), because the Commission has failed in its mission. Its final report does not appropriately assess \"CAM\" methods, lacks objectivity, and was principally the opinions of Commission leaders who revised it without most of the members ever seeing the final edition. The report is an unqualified endorsement of so-called \"CAM,\" a New-Age marketing term which falsely proposes that untested and unscientific methods of care are equivalent to evidence-based medical practices. Some members of the Commission have objected to the methods and recommendations and issued a significant dissent, pointing out where the Commission had fallen short. WHCCAMP's public relations agency released a list of \"final draft\" recommendations more than a week ago. Subsequently, the Commission's leadership took control of the report and rewrote sections in an attempt to stifle dissent from several members. The final report went to the White House without the majority of the commissioners actually seeing the final copy.

NCAHF news release, March 13, 2002] Canadian neurologists warn against chiropractic neck manipulation. Sixty-two clinical neurologists from across Canada, all certified members of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, have issued a written warning to the Canadian public and provincial governments about the dangers of neck manipulation [Stewart B and others. [Statement of concern to the Canadian public from Canadian neurologists regarding the debilitating and fatal damage manipulation of the neck may cause to the nervous system](https://www.ncahf.org/Chirobase.org/15News/neurol.html), February 2002.] The signatories include private neurologists as well as chiefs of neurology departments of major teaching hospitals. Calling their concerns significant, they warn that stroke and death due to neck manipulation has been reported in the scientific literature for over 50 years and that manipulation is one of the leading causes of stroke in the under 45-age group. The neurologists express six basic concerns: - They first call upon physicians to be more vigilant. All patients presenting with a stroke, especially those less than 45, should be questioned about recent neck manipulation. They advise that physicians need to make an immediate referral to a neurologist for any patient with a history of neck manipulation that is followed by symptoms of stroke. - They urge the public to recognize that symptoms such as sudden neck pain, visual disturbances and nausea following neck manipulation are not normal. They warn that under no circumstances should an individual allow their necks to be manipulated is any of these symptoms are present. - They endorse the Inquest Jury recommendations into the death of Laurie Jean Mathiason of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, a 20-year-old woman who died following a chiropractic neck manipulation. That Jury recommended that the risk of stroke and other inherent risks associated with chiropractic treatment be visible and available in the reception area of every chiropractic facility. - They express concern that in a routine autopsy the vertebral arteries in the neck are almost never removed and examined. As it is these arteries that are most often damaged by neck manipulation, they urge close inspection of the vertebral arteries in all suspicious cases. Further, such cases should be referred to the office of the regional coroner. - They urge all the provincial Ministries of Health to act upon the strong concerns expressed by the Canadian Pediatric Community about neck manipulation in the pediatric age group. They call for immediate banning of all spinal manipulation of infants and children. - They call for an Inquiry into what they consider to be endless non-scientific claims being made as to the uses of neck manipulation.

California voters attack chiropractic insurance fraud. [Proposition 44,](https://www.ncahf.org/Chirobase.org/08Legal/prop44.html) which 79.4% of voters approved in the March 5 primary election, requires the Board of Chiropractic Examiners to revoke for ten years the license of a chiropractor who is convicted for a second time, or is convicted of multiple counts in a single case of various specified offenses including insurance fraud. The measure requires the board to investigate any licensed chiropractor who has been criminally charged with committing insurance fraud, if the district attorney does not object to the investigation. The measure also includes as \"unprofessional conduct\" the hiring of \"runners\" by chiropractors to procure patients. Its passage was a reaction to the exposure of widespread chiropractic fraud connected with personal injury claims. Voter approval was needed to modify the law because the original chiropractic licensing law was enacted by referendum. FTC curbs Wonder Bread claims. Interstate Bakeries Corp.

[ [Ryan charges two companies with false Internet marketing of products that supposedly detect deadly anthrax bacteria](http://www.ag.state.il.us/pressrelease/121501.htm). News release, Dec 15, 2001] - Gateway Distributors, Ltd. and TRSG Corporation d/b/a The Right Solution was charged with falsely marketing a V-Scan product\u2014a purported ultraviolet light\u2014to detect the presence of anthrax. The $50 product is a cheap-looking flashlight-like device that appears to contain a black light bulb. The company claimed that the device could detect and identify anthrax and a wide variety of other biological agents. However, according to health officials, anthrax and most bacteria and viruses do not glow under ultraviolet light, so the product is useless. - Jeff Anderson d/b/a Early Detection Services was charged with falsely marketing a nasal swab claiming that it can determine if a person has been exposed to anthrax. The $150 plastic nasal swab unit is supposedly sent to a laboratory for testing after a sample is taken. However, the suit alleges that this kind of testing will not determine if someone has contracted the disease. If the nasal swab tests negative, the individual could still have anthrax in the lungs. Similarly, a positive result does not indicate that the person has the disease, but merely that anthrax spores have been detected in the nose. Both suits seek permanent injunctions prohibiting their marketing practices in Illinois, in addition to restitution, civil penalties and court costs.

The public must be made aware that the neurological damage that can result subsequent to upper neck manipulation can be debilitating and fatal. We make the following recommendations for the attention of the Canadian public, the practitioners of manipulation, the medical community, the provincial Ministries of Health and the health care professional regulatory bodies. Our concerns are significant. Stroke and death due to neck manipulation has been reported in the scientific literature for over 50 years [1-10]. New deaths, in the past few years, have been reported to the Canadian Stroke Consortium [11]. The Canadian Stroke Consortium recently published a major prospective study [12]. The latest data from the Stroke Consortium indicates that \"more than 100 cases of dissection per year are associated with neck manipulation.\" [13] The resulting stroke and debilitation from such a large number is very significant. A recent study by the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES Ontario) indicates that patients with posterior circulation strokes under the age of 45 are 5 times more likely than controls to have visited a chiropractor within one week of the event [14]. Concern #1: Physicians need greater diagnostic awareness of the neurological complications that may result from neck manipulation, Many physicians are not aware of the risks associated with neck manipulation and thus fail to undertake the appropriate investigations [15] A history of neck manipulation or severe neck pain accompanied by signs or symptoms of stroke should prompt an immediate referral to a neurologist for examination and appropriate investigation. Multiple neurological complications can result subsequent to neck manipulation. The most dramatic is arterial dissection leading to stroke and death. Cervical manipulation most commonly causes stroke occurring in the back part of the brain. This can be particularly disabling as it can affect such basic functions as swallowing, speaking and walking. We recommend that the neurology community undertake an educational program for primary care and emergency room physicians to increase diagnostic awareness of the dangers of neck manipulation and its multiple neurological complications. Concern #2: There is an urgent need for the public to be fully and properly informed of the dangers of neck manipulation. Members of the public are largely unaware of the complications of neck manipulation. Well-documented complications include damage to the nerves in the neck, compression of the spinal cord by unstable discs, tearing of the arteries in the neck, stroke and death. The most significant complication of manipulation is stroke secondary to torn arteries in the neck. The first symptom may be sudden neck pain following neck manipulation [12]. Patients often ignore this pain, as it may have been neck pain that prompted the visit in the first place. Other important symptoms suggestive of stroke include visual disturbances, nausea, dizziness, poor co-ordination, and weakness or numbness on one side of the body. The onset of these symptoms should prompt an immediate medical assessment. Under no circumstances should an individual allow their necks to be manipulated if any of these symptoms are present. We recommend that the medical community undertake an information campaign to increase public awareness of the risks of neck manipulation. Special attention should be paid to increasing awareness of the symptoms of stroke following manipulation. Concern #3: The individual patient needs to be fully and directly aware that serious risks do exist. We endorse the major recommendations of the 1998 inquest into the manipulation-induced death of Laurie Jean Mathiason of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. This Inquest recommended that the \"risk of stroke and other inherent risks associated with chiropractic treatment be visible and available in the reception area of every chiropractic facility.\" [16] We further recommend that other practitioners of manipulation therapy, including physiotherapists, should have a warning posted in their offices about the risks of neck manipulation. Qualified epidemiologists, medical scientists and legal experts should develop a patient information form that it truly reflective of the risks. This should be presented to every patient. This should include up to date scientific information on the risks per individual patient rather than dated, non-scientific claims that significantly underestimate the risk to the individual patient. Concern #4: We are concerned that current autopsy procedures fail to diagnose all cases. In the course of a routine autopsy, the vertebral arteries in the neck are almost never removed and examined. Cases of death due to neck manipulation have been missed [17]. It is important to know the true incidence. As there may be a significant time delay between manipulation and stroke, any person dying of stroke within three months of a neck manipulation should have their carotid and/or vertebral arteries examined by a pathologist. This is especially important in those patients under the age of 45 in whom a clear cause for stroke cannot be identified [14]. Suspicious cases should be reported to the office of the regional Coroner. This will allow a better estimate of the true incidence of stroke and death secondary to cervical manipulation. Concern #5: Provincial Ministries of Health should ackowledge and act upon the strong concerns and recommendations of the scientific pediatric community regarding so-called \"pediatric chiropractic.\" Chiropractors in Canada perform cervical manipulation in children for the \"treatment\" of infantile colic, inner ear infections, bedwetting and a myriad of other paediatric illnesses. Chiropractic authorities claim that parents should bring their new-born baby to a chiropractor \"as soon as possible after birth.\" [18] Such claims and recommendations have no scientific basis and only expose infants and children to unwarranted neck manipulation. Strong concerns have been expressed by the Chiefs of Paediatrics of our Canadian Hospitals [19] and by the Canadian Paediatric Society regarding chiropractic manipulation on the spines of infants and children [20]. Paralysis and other complications in infants and children following cervical neck manipulation have occurred [21]. Death has also been reported [23]. We strongly recommend that each provincial Ministry of Health order the immediate banning of all spinal manipulation of infants and children. Concern #6: We express our strong concern about the many non-scientific claims made as to the conditions that purportedly may benefit from neck manipulaltion. There are endless non-scientific claims being made as to the uses of neck manipulation. The public must be made aware that the very great majority of these claims have little or no evidence to support them. We call upon the responsible governmental health authorities to conduct a full inquiry into the dubious claims being made. Representatives of all concerned parties should be brought together in such an inquiry. This should include an examination of the information being taught at all schools and courses dealing with manipulation therapy.
