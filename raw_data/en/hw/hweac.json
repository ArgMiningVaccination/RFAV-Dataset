Chapter 1 How Your HMO Plan Works How the Plan Works Primary Care Provider Each Member must choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) who will provide or authorize care. If you do not choose a PCP, we will not pay for any services or supplies except for Emergency care. Note : If you require non- Emergency health care services, you should always call your PCP. Without authorization from your PCP, services may not be covered. You should never wait until your condition becomes an Emergency to call. Covered Services We will pay for Covered Services and supplies when they are Medically Necessary . [For most Covered Services , you will first have to meet a Deductible . For some of these services, you will also pay a Copayment after you meet your Deductible .

Provider network We offer Members access to an extensive network of physicians, hospitals, and other Providers throughout the Service Area .

Those reasons include: a Provider's retirement; moving out of the Service Area ; or failure to continue to meet our credentialing standards. , This can also happen if Tufts Health Plan and the Provider are unable to reach agreement on a contract. This is because Providers are independent contra ctors; they do not work for us. For questions about the availability of a Provider , call a Member Specialist.

About Your Primary Care Provider Importance of choosing a PCP Each Member must choose a PCP when he or she enrolls. The PCP you choose will be associated with a specific Tufts Health Plan Provider Organization . You will usually receive Covered Services from health care professionals and facilities associated with that Tufts Health Plan Provider Organization . Once you have chosen a PCP, you are eligible for all Covered Services . IMPORTANT NOTE : Until you have chosen a PCP, only Emergency care is covered. What a PCP does A PCP: (1) provides routine health care (This in cludes routine physical examinations.); (2) arranges for your care with other Tufts Health Plan Providers , ; and (3) provides referrals for other health care services. See \" Inpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" and \"Outpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" later in this chapter. Those section have more information about obtaining referrals for these services. Your PCP, or a Covering Provider , is available 24 hours a day. Your PCP will coordinate your care by treating you or referring you to specialty services. Choosing a PCP You must choose a PCP from the list of PCPs in our Directory of Health Care Providers . You may already have a Provider who is listed as a PCP. In most instances you may choose him or her as your PCP. Once you choose a PCP in our network , you must inform us of your choice. This is required for you to be eligible for all Covered Services. You may not have a PCP. Or, your PCP may not be not listed in our Directory of Health Care Providers , . In either case, call a Member Specialist for help in choosing a PCP. [Note : Under certain circumstances required by law, if your Provider is not in our network, you will be covered for a short period of time for services provided by your Provider . A Member Specialist can give you more information. Please see \"Continuity of Care\" above.] Contacting your new PCP If you choose a new Provider as your PCP, you should: Contact your new PCP as soon as you join. Identify yourself as a new Tufts Health Plan Member , to him or her; Ask your previous Provider to transfer your medical records to your new PCP; and Make an appointment for a check-up or to meet your PCP. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-7 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com . About Your Primary Care Provider, continued If you can't reach your PCP by phone right away Your PCP may not be able to take your call right away. Always leave a message with the office staff or answering service. Wait a reasonable amount of time for someone to return you call. You may need medical services after hours. Contact your PCP or a Covering Provider . A Provider is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For Inpatient mental health or substance abuse services after hours, call 1-800-208-9565. Note : You may experience a medical emergency. If this happens, you do not have to contact your PCP or a Covering Provider ; instead, proceed to the neares t emergency medical facility for treatment (see \" Emergency and Urgent Care \" above for more information). Changing your PCP You may change your PCP. In certain instances, we may require you to do so. The new Provider will not be considered your PCP until: you choose a new PCP from our Directory of Health Care Providers ; you report your choice to a Member Specialist; and we approve the change in your PCP. Note : You may not change your PCP while an Inpatient or in a partial hospitalization program, except when approved by Tufts Health Plan in limited circumstances. Canceling appointments You may need to cancel an appointment with any Provider , . If so, always give as much notice to the Provider as possible (at least 24 hours). Your Provider's office may charge for missed appointments that you did not cancel in advance. If this happens, we will not pay for the charges. Referrals for specialty services Every PCP is associated with a specific Provider Organization . If you need to see a specialist (including a pediatric specialist), your PCP will select the specialist and make the referral. Usually, your PCP will select and refer you to another Provider in the same Provider Organization (as defined in Appendix A). The PCP and the specialists already have a working relationship; as a result, this helps to provide quality and continuity of care. You may need specialty care not available within your PCP's Provider Organization This is a rare event. If this happens, your PCP will choose a specialist in another Provider Organization and make the referral. When selecting a specialist for you, your PCP will consider: (1) any long- standing relationships that you have with any Tufts Health Plan Provider ; and (2) your clinical needs. (A long-standing relationship means that you have recently been seen or been treated repeatedly by that Tufts HP specialist.) Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-8 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com .

You are responsible for any charges over the Reasonable Charge (as well as any applicable Copayment ).] Notes: You need a referral to a specialist from your PCP. You need that before receiving any Covered Services from that specialist. If you do not do this, you will be responsible for the cost of those services. Covered Services provided by non- Tufts Health Plan Providers are not paid for unless: (1) approved in advance by your PCP; and (2) approved by Tufts Health Plan or its designee . A specialist refers you to a non- Tufts Health Plan Provider . If so, the referral must be approved by your PCP. It must also be approved by Tufts Health Plan or its designee. Referrals for mental health and substance abuse services: You do not need a referral from your PCP for care from a Tufts Health Plan Provider . However, we recommend that you obtain authorization from a Tufts Health Plan Mental Health Authorized Reviewer for that care. See \" Inpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" and \" Outpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" later in this chapter. Referral forms for specialty services Except as provided below, your PCP must complete a referral to refer you to a specialist. Your PCP may ask you to give a referral form to the specialist at your appointment. Your PCP may refer you for one or more visits and for different types of services. Your PCP must approve referrals a specialist makes to other Providers . Make sure that your PCP makes a referral before you go to any other Provider . A PCP may approve a standing referral. This referral would be for specialty health care provided by a Tufts Health Plan Provider . Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-9 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059.

Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com . Financial Arrangements between Tufts Health Plan and Tufts Health Plan Providers Methods of payment to Tufts Health Plan Providers Our goal in paying Providers is to encourage preventive care and active illness management. We strive to be sure that our financial reimbur sement system: (1) encourages appropriate access to care; (2) and rewards Providers for providing high quality care to our Members . We use a variety of mutually agreed upon methods to compensate Tufts Health Plan Providers . The Tufts Health Plan Directory of Health Care Providers indicates the method of payment for each Provider . Regardless of the method of payment, we expect all participating Providers to use sound medical judgment when providing care and when determining whether a referral for specialty care is appropriate. This approach encourages the provision of Medically Necessary care and reduces the number of unnecessary medi cal tests and procedures that can be both harmful and costly to Members . We review the quality of care provided to our Members through our Quality of Health Care Program. Feel free to discuss with your Provider specific questions about how he or she is paid. Member Identification Card Introduction Tufts Health Plan gives each Member a member identification card (Member ID). Reporting errors When you receive your Member ID card, check it carefully. If any information is wrong, call a Member Specialist. Identifying yourself as a Tufts Health Plan Member Your Member ID card is important; it identifies you as a Tufts Health Plan Member . Please: carry your Member ID card at all times; have your Member ID card with you for m edical, hospital and other appointments; and show your Member ID card to any Provider before you receive health care services. When you receive services, tell the office staff that you are a Tufts Health Plan Member . IMPORTANT NOTE : Identify yourself as a Tufts Health Plan Member .

It does this by evaluat ing whether health care services provided to Members are: (1) Medically Necessary; and (2) provided in the most appropriate and efficient manner. [Under this program, we sometimes engage in prospective, concurrent, and retrospective review of health care services.] [We use prospective review to determine if proposed treatment is Medically Necessary . This review happens before that treatment begins. Prospec tive review is also referred to as \"Pre- Service Review\". We engage in concurrent review . We do this to: monitor the course of treatment as it occurs; and to determine when that treatment is no longer Medically Necessary . We use retrospective review to evaluate care after it is provided.Sometimes, we use retrospective review to mo re accurately decide if a Member's health care services are appropriate. Retrospective review is al so called \"Post-Service Review\". ] [ TIMEFRAMES FOR TUFTS HEALTH PLAN TO REVIEW YOUR COVERAGE REQUEST: Type of Review: Timeframe for Determinations:* Prospective (Pre-Service).

When federal COBRA coverage is effective A Member who is eligible for federal COBRA cont inuation coverage (a \"qualified beneficiary\") must be given an election period of 60 days to choose whether to elect federal COBRA continuation coverage. This period is measur ed from the later of the date the qualified beneficiary's coverage under the Group Contract ends (see the list of qualifying events described above); or the date the plan provides the qualif ied beneficiary with a COBRA election notice. A qualified beneficiary's federal COBRA continuation coverage becomes effective retroactive to the start of the election period, if he or she elects and pays for that coverage. Cost of Coverage In most cases, you are responsible for payment of 102% of the cost of coverage for the federal COBRA continuation coverage.

Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of co verage, may permit a qualified beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of COBRA continuation coverage.

You may be responsible for payment of up to 150% of the cost of COBRA coverage for th is additional period of up to 11 months.

The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) The Uniformed Services Employment and Reempl oyment Rights Act (USERRA) protects the job rights of individuals who voluntarily or involunt arily leave employment positions to undertake military service or certain types of service in the National Disaster Medical System. USERRA also prohibits employers from discriminating against past and present members of the uniformed services, and applicants to the uniformed services. Under USERRA: You have the right to be reemployed in your ci vilian job if you leave that job to perform service in the uniformed service, and (1) you ensure that your employer receives advance written or verbal notice of your service; (2 ) you have five years or less of cumulative service in the uniformed service while with that particular employer' (3) you return to work or apply for reemployment in a timely manner after conclusion of service; and (4) you have not been separated from service with a dis qualifying discharge or under other than honorable conditions. If you are eligible to be reemployed, you must be restored to the job and benefits you would have attained if you have not been absent due to military service or, in some cases, a comparable job. If you are a past or present member of the uniformed services, have applied for membership in the uniformed services, or are obligated to serve in the uniformed services, then an employer may not deny you initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment because of this status. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against anyone a ssisting in the enforcement of USERRA rights, including testifying or making a st atement in connection with a proceeding under USERRA, even if that person has no service connection. If you leave your job to perform military service, you have the right to elect to continue your existing employer-based health plan coverage for you and your Dependents for up to 24 months while in the military. If you don't elect to continue coverage during your military service, you have the right to be reinstated in your employer's health plan w hen you are reemployed, generally without any waiting periods or exclusions (for example, pre-existing condition ex clusions) except for service-connected illnesses or injuries. Service members may be required to pay up to 102% of the premium for the health plan coverage. If coverage is for less than 31 days, the service member is only required to pay the employee share, if any, for such coverage. USERRA coverage runs concurrently with CO BRA and other state c ontinuation coverage. The U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans' Empl oyment and Training Service (VETS) is authorized to investigate and resolve complaints of USERRA violations. For assistance in filing a complaint, or for any other information on USERRA, contact VETS at 1- 866-4-USA-DOL, or visit its WEB site at www.dol.gove/vets.

This Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") provision applies to This Plan when an employee or the employee's covered dependent has health care coverage under more than one Plan. \"Plan\" and \"This Plan\" are defined below. B. If this COB provision applies, the order of benef it determination rules should be looked at first. Those rules determine whether the benefits of \"This Plan\" are determined before or after those of another plan. T he benefits of \"This Plan\": (1) shall not be reduced when, under the order of benefit determination rules, \"This Plan\" determines its benefits bef ore another plan; but (2) may be reduced when, under the order of benefits determination rules, another plan determines its benefits first. The above reduction is described in the \"Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" \" section below. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 7-5 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com . Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits, continued Definitions A. \"Plan\" is any of the following which provides benefits or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (1) Group insurance or group-type coverage whet her insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, group practice or individual prac tice coverage. It also includes coverage other than school accident-type coverage. (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or cove rage required to be provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (T itle XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs, of the Un ited States Social Security Act, as amended from time to time). Each contract or other arrangement for coverage under (1) or (2) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate plan. B. \"This Plan\" is the part of the Group Contract that provides benefits for health care expenses. C. \"Primary Plan/Secondary Plan:\" The order of benefit determination rules state whether \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan as to another plan covering the person. When \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan, its benefits ar e determined before those of the other plan and without considering the other pl an's benefits. When \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan, its benefits are determined after those of the ot her plan and may be reduced because of the other plan's benefits. When there are more t han two plans covering the person, \"This Plan\" may be a Primary Plan as to one or more other plans, and may be a Secondary Plan as to a different plan or plans. D. \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessary, r easonable and customary item of expense for health care; when the item of expense is cove red at least in part by one or more plans covering the person for whom the claim is m ade. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi-p rivate hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense under the above definition unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is medically necessary either in terms of generally accepted medical practice, or as specifically defined in the plan. When a plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. E. \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar y ear. However, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no cover age under \"This Plan\", or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 7-6 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com . Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Order of Benefit Determination Rules A. General. When there is a basis for a claim under \"This Plan\" and another plan, \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan which has its benefits determined after those of the other plan, unless: (1) The other plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those of \"This Plan\"; and (2) Both those rules and \"This Plan's rules, in Subsection B below, require that \"This Plan\"'s benefits be determined before t hose of the other plan. B. Rules. \"This Plan\" determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules which applies: (1) Non-Dependent/Dependent. The benefits of the plan which covers the person as an employee, member or subscriber (that is, other than as a dependent) are determined before those of the plan which covers the person as a dependent. (2) Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced. Except as stated in Paragraph B(3) below, when \"This Plan\" and another plan cover the same child as a dependent of different person, called \"parents:\" (a) The benefits of the plan of the parent w hose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before those of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; but (b) If both parents have the same birthday, t he benefits of the plan which covered the parents longer are determined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. However, if the other plan does not have t he rule described in (a) immediately above, but instead has the rule based upon the gender of the patient, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other plan will determine the order of benefits. (3) Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced. If two or more plans cover a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child are determined in this order: (a) First, the plan of the parent with custody of the child; (b) Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and (c) Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a cour t decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. The plan of the other parent shall be the Secondary Plan. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any Claim Determination Period or Plan year during which any benefits ar e actually paid or provided before the entity has that actual knowledge. (4) Joint Custody. If the specific terms of a court decree state that the parents shall share joint custody, without stating that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering t he child shall follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined above in Pa ragraph B(2) of this section. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 7-7 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com . Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits, continued (5) Active/Inactive Employee. The benefits of a plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as that employee's dependent) are determined before those of a plan which covers that person as a laid off or retired employee (or as that employee's dependent). If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benef its, this Rule (5) is ignored. (6) Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the pl an which covered an employee, member or subscriber longer are determined before those of the Plan which covered that person for the shorter term. Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" A. When This Section Applies. This section applies when, in accordance with the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section above, \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan as to one or more other plans. In that event the benefits of \"This Plan\" may be reduced under this section. Such other plan or plans are referred to as \"the other plans\" in B immediately below. B. Reduction in \"This Plan\"'s Benefits. The benefits of \"This Plan\" will be reduced when the sum of: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the A llowable Expenses under \"This Plan\" in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that would be payable for the A llowable Expenses under the other plans, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this CO B provision, whether or not claim is made, exceeds those Allowable Ex penses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the benefits of \"This Plan\" will be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under the other plans do not total more than those Allowable Expenses. When the benefits of \"This Plan\" are reduced as de scribed above, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of \"This Plan\". Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules. Tufts Health Plan has the right to decide which facts it needs. It may get needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person. Tufts Health Plan need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under \"This Plan\" must give Tufts Health Plan any facts it needs to pay the claim. Facility of Payment A payment made under another plan may incl ude an amount which should have been paid under \"This Plan\". If it does, Tufts Health Plan may pay that amount to the organization which made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under \"This Plan\". Tufts Health Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" means reasonable cash value of the benefits provi ded in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services.

ERISA RIGHTS, continued Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for plan partici pants ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the pl an. The people who operate your plan, called ``fiduciaries'' of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including y our employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a plan benefit or exerci sing your rights under ERISA. Enforcing Your Rights If your claim for a plan benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of document s relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a feder al court. In such a case, the court may require the plan administrator to provide the material s and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits whic h is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you Enforcing Your Rights - continued: may file suit in a state or federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualifi ed status of a domestic relations order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in federal cour t.

The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal f ees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees.

However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if t he attending provider (e.g., your physician, nurse midwife, or physician assistant), after consulta tion with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, plans or issuers may not set the level of benefits or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48-hour (or 96-hou r) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a physician or other health care provider obtain authorization for prescribing a length of stay or up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, you may be required to obtain precertification. For information on precertification, contact your plan administrator.

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT OF 1993 Note : The Family and Medical Leave Act only applies to groups with 50 or more employees. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), if an employee meets the eligibility requirements, that employee is legally allowed to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following reasons: for the birth and care of the newborn child of the employee; for placement with the employee of a s on or daughter for adoption or foster care; to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or to take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition. The FMLA was amended to add two new leave rights re lated to military service, effective January 16, 2009: Qualifying Exigency Leave: Eligible employees ar e entitled to up to 12 weeks of leave because of \"any qualifying exigency\" due to the fact t hat the spouse, son, daught er, or parent of the employee is on active duty, or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status, in support of a contingency operation. Military Caregiver Leave: An eligible employ ee who is the spouse, son, daughter parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty is entit led to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12- month period to care for the servicemember. T he employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks for all types of FMLA leave in the single 12-month period. In order to be eligible, the employee must have wo rked for his or her employer for a total of 12 months and worked at least 1,250 hour s over the previous 12 months. A covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage for an employee on FMLA leave whenever such insurance was provi ded before the leave was taken and on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. If applicable, arrangements will need to be made for employees to pay their share of health in surance premiums while on leave. In some instances, the employer may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from FMLA leave. An employee should contact his or her employer for details about FMLA and to make payment arrangements, if applicable. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A.

Chapter 1 How Your HMO Plan Works How the Plan Works Primary Care Provider Each Member must choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) who will provide or authorize care. If you do not choose a PCP, we will not pay for any services or supplies except for Emergency care. As described in the \"Overview\" section on pages iii and iv, your selection of a PCP affects your level of benefits under this Evidence of Coverage . Note: If you require non- Emergency health care services, you should always call your PCP. Your will either provide or coordinate your care. You should never wait until your condition becomes an Emergency to call. Covered Services Tufts Health Plan will only pay for Covered Services and supplies when we determine that they are Medically Necessary . The term, Medically Necessary , is defined in Appendix A of this Evidence of Coverage. See Chapter 3 for a description of the Covered Services available under this plan. For many Covered Services , you will first have to meet a Deductible . If you are enrolled in the Advantage Level, your Deductible is a lower amount. If you are instead enrolled in the Basic Level, your Deductible is a higher amount. For certain Covered Services , you will also pay a Copayment after you meet your Deductible . For more information about your Member costs for medical services, see \"Benefit Overview\" at the front of this Evidence of Coverage . Service Area (see Appendix A) In most cases, you must receive care in the Tufts Health Plan Service Area . (The Service Area is defined in Appendix A. It incl udes both the Standard and Extended Service Area ). The exceptions are for an Emergency , or Urgent Care while traveling outside of the Service Area . See the Tufts Health Plan Directory of Health Care Providers for Tufts Health Plan's Service Area . In rare events, a service cannot be provided by a Tufts Health Plan Provider in either the Standard or Extended Service Area. In those instances, call a Member Specialist for assistance. You can also visit our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com . Provider network We offer Members access to an extensive network of physicians, hospitals, and other Providers throughout the Service Area . We work to ensure the continued availability of our Providers. However, our network of Providers may change during the year. This can happen for many reasons. Those reasons include: a Provider's retirement; moving out of the Service Area ; or failure to continue to meet our credentialing standards. This can also happen if Tufts Health Plan and the Provider are unable to reach agreement on a contract. This is because Providers are independent contractors; they do not work for us. For questions about the availability of a Provider , call a Member Specialist. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-2 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. How the Plan Works , continued Coverage IF you... AND you are...

You may receive care outside the Standard or Extended Service Area. If this happens, the Emergency or Urgent Care Provider may: (1) bill Tufts Health Plan directly; or (2) require you to pay at the time of service. If you must pay, we will reimburse you up to the Reasonable Charge for this care. You must pay the applicable Copayment. See \"Bills from Providers \" in Chapter 6 for more information about how to get reimbursed for this care. You may need Inpatient services. In most cases, you will be admitted to your PCP's Tufts Health Plan Hospital .

About Your Primary Care Provider Importance of choosing a PCP Each Member must choose a PCP when he or she enrolls. The PCP you choose will be associated with a specific Tufts Health Plan Provider Organization . You will usually receive Covered Services from health care professionals and facilities associated with that Tufts Health Plan Provider Organization . Once you have chosen a PCP, you are eligible for all Covered Services . IMPORTANT NOTE : Until you have chosen a PCP, only Emergency care is covered. What a PCP does A PCP: (1) provides routine health care (This incl udes routine physical examinations.); (2) arranges for your care with other Tufts Health Plan Providers ; and (3) provides referrals for other health care services. See \" Inpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" and \" Outpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" later in this chapt er. Those sections have more information about obtaining referrals for these services. Your PCP, or a Covering Provider , is available 24 hours a day. Your PCP will coordinate your care by treating you or referring you to specialty services. Choosing a PCP You must choose a PCP from the list of PCPs in our Directory of Health Care Providers . You may already have a Provider who is listed as a PCP. In most instances, you may choose him or her as your PCP. Once you choose a PCP in our network , you must inform us of your choice. This is required for you to be eligible for all Covered Services. You may not have a PCP. Or, your PCP may not be listed in our Directory of Health Care Providers. In either case, call a Member Specialist for help in choosing a PCP. Contacting your new PCP If you choose a new Provider as your PCP, you should: Contact your new PCP as soon as you join. Identify yourself as a new Tufts Health Plan Member to him or her; Ask your previous Provider to transfer your medical records to your new PCP; and Make an appointment for a check-up or to meet your PCP. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-6 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. About Your Primary Care Provider, continued If you can't reach your PCP by phone right away Your PCP may not take your call right away. Alwa ys leave a message with the office staff or answering service. Wait a reasonable amount of time for someone to return you call. You may need medical services after hours. Contact your PCP or a Covering Provider . A Provider is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For Inpatient mental health or substance abuse services after hours, call 1-800-208-9565. Note : You may experience a medical emergency. If this happens, you do not have to contact your PCP or a Covering Provider ; instead, proceed to the nearest emergency medical facility for treatment (see \" Emergency and Urgent Care \" above for more information). Changing your PCP You may change your PCP. In certain instances, we may require you to do so. The new Provider will not be considered your PCP until: you choose a new PCP from our Directory of Health Care Providers ; you report your choice to a Member Specialist; and we approve the change in your PCP. Note : You may not change your PCP while an Inpatient or in a partial hospitalization program, except when approved by Tufts Health Plan in limited circumstances. Canceling appointments You may need to cancel an appointment with a Provider. If so, always give as much notice to the Provider as possible (at least 24 hours). Your Provider's office may charge for missed appointments that you did not cancel in advance. If this happens, we will not pay for the charges. Referrals for specialty services Every PCP is associated with a specific Provider Organization . If you need to see a specialist (including a pediatric specialist), your PCP will select the specialist and make the referral. Usually, your PCP will select and refer you to another Provider in the same Provider Organization . The PCP and the specialists already have a working relationship; as a result, this helps to provide quality and continuity of care. You may need specialty care not available within your PCP's Provider Organization (This is a rare event). If this happens, your PCP will choose a specialist in another Provider Organization and make the referral. When selecting a specialist for you, your PCP will consider: (1) any long-standing relationships that you have with any Tufts Health Plan Provider ; and (2) your clinical needs. (A long- standing relationship means that you have recent ly been seen or been treated repeatedly by that Tufts HP specialist.) Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-7 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. About Your Primary Care Provider , continued Referrals for specialty services, continued You may require specialty care not available through any Tufts Health Plan Provider. (This is a rare event.), Your PCP may refer you, with the prior approval of Tufts Health Plan or its designee, to a Provider not associated with Tufts Health Plan . Notes: You need a referral to a specialist from your PCP. You need that before receiving any Covered Services from that specialist. If you do not do this, you will be responsible for the cost of those services. Covered Services provided by non- Tufts Health Plan Providers are not paid for unless: (1) approved in advance by your PCP; and (2) approved by Tufts Health Plan or its designee . Referrals for mental health and substance abuse services: You do not need a referral from your PCP for care from a Tufts Health Plan Provider. However we recommend that you obtain prior authorization for that care. See \" Inpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" and \"Outpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" later in this chapter. Referral forms for specialty services Except as provided below, your PCP must complete a referral to refer you to a specialist. Your PCP may ask you to give a referral form to the specialist at your appointment. Your PCP may refer you for one or more visits and for different types of services. Your PCP must approve referrals a specialist makes to other Providers . Make sure that your PCP makes a referral before you go to any other Provider . A PCP may approve a standing referral. This referral would be for specialty health care provided by a Tufts Health Plan Provider . Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-8 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059.

Financial Arrangements between Tufts Health Plan and Tufts Health Plan Providers Methods of payment to Tufts Health Plan Providers Our goal in paying Providers is to encourage preventive care and active illness management. We strive to be sure that our financial reimbursem ent system: (1) encourages appropriate access to care; and (2) rewards Providers for providing high quality care to our Members . We use a variety of mutually agreed upon methods to compensate Tufts Health Plan Providers . The Tufts Health Plan Directory of Health Care Providers indicates the method of payment for each Provider . Regardless of the method of payment, we expect all participating Providers to use sound medical judgment when providing care and when determi ning whether a referral for specialty care is appropriate. This approach encourages the provision of Medically Necessary care and reduces the number of unnecessary medical tests and procedures that can be both harmful and costly to Members . We review the quality of care provided to our Members through our Quality of Health Care Program. Feel free to discuss with your Provider specific questions about how he or she is paid. Member Identification Card Introduction Tufts Health Plan gives each Member a member identification card (Member ID). Reporting errors When you receive your Member ID card, check it ca refully. If any information is wrong, call a Member Specialist. Identifying yourself as a Tufts Health Plan Member Your Member ID card is important; it identifies you as a Tufts Health Plan Member . Please: carry your Member ID card at all times; have your Member ID card with you for medical, hospital and other appointments; and show your Member ID card to any Provider before you receive health care services. When you receive services, tell the office staff that you are a Tufts Health Plan Member . IMPORTANT NOTE : Identify yourself as a Tufts Health Plan Member. If you do not, then: we may not pay for the services provided; and you would be responsible for the costs. Membership requirement You are eligible for benefits if you are a Member when you receive care. A Member ID card alone is not enough to get you benefits. If you receive care when you are not a Member , you are responsible for the cost. Membership identification number If you have any questions about your member ident ification number, call a Member Specialist. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-10 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Utilization Management Tufts Health Plan has a utilization management program. The purpose of the program is to control health care costs. It does this by evaluati ng whether health care services provided to Members are: (1) Medically Necessary; and (2) provided in the most appropriate and efficient manner. Under this program, we sometimes engage in prospec tive, concurrent, and retrospective review of health care services. We use prospective review to determine if proposed treatment is Medically Necessary. This review happens before that treatment begins. Prospec tive review is also referred to as \"Pre- Service Review\". We engage in concurrent review . We do this to: monitor the course of treatment as it occurs; and determine when that treatment is no longer Medically Necessary . We use retrospective review to evaluate care after it is provided. Sometimes, we use retrospective review to mo re accurately decide if a Member's health care services are appropriate Members . Retrospective review is also called \"Post-Service Review\". TIMEFRAMES FOR TUFTS HEALTH PLAN TO REVIEW YOUR REQUEST FOR COVERAGE Type of Review: Timeframe for Determinations:* Prospective (Pre-Service). Urgent : Within 72 hours of receiving all necessary information, and prior to the expected date of service. Non-urgent : Within 15 business days of receiving all necessary information and prior to the expected date of service. Concurrent Review. Prior to the end of the current certified period. Retrospective (Post-Service). Within 30 business days of receipt of a request for payment with all supporting documentation. *See Appendix B for determination procedures under the Department of Labor's (DOL) Regulations. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-11 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Utilization Management, continued We may deny your request for coverage. If this happens, you have the right to file an appeal. See Chapter 6 for information on how to file an appeal. Tufts Health Plan makes coverage determinations. You and your Provider make all treatment decisions. IMPORTANT NOTE : Members can call Tufts Health Plan these numbers to determine the status or outcome of utilization review decisions: mental health or substance abuse utiliz ation review decisions - 1-800-208-9565; all other utilization revi ew decisions - 1-800-682-8059 Specialty case management Some Members with Severe Illnesses or Injuries ma y warrant case management intervention under our specialty case management progr am. Under this program, we: encourage the use of the most appropria te and cost-effective treatment; and support the Member's treatment and progress. We may contact that Member and his or her Tufts Health Plan Provider . We may do this to discuss a treatment plan and establish short and long term goals. The Tufts Health Plan Specialty Case Manager may suggest alternative treat ment settings available to the Member . We may periodically review the Member's treatment plan. We will contact the Member and the Member's Tufts Health Plan Provider if we identify alternatives to the Member's current treatment plan that: qualify as Covered Services; are cost effective; and are appropriate for the Member . A Severe Illness or Injury includes, but is not limited to, the following: high-risk pregnancy and newborn Children ; AIDS or other immune system diseases; serious heart or lung disease; certain mental health conditions, including substance abuse; cancer; severe traumatic injury. certain neurological diseases; Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-12 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Utilization Management, continued Individual case management (ICM) In certain circumstances, Tufts Health Plan may approve an individual case management (\"ICM\") plan for a Member with a Severe Illness or Injury. The IC M plan is designed to arrange for the most appropriate type, level, and setting of health care services and supplies for the Member . As a part of the ICM plan, we may approve coverage for alternative services and supplies that do not otherwise qualify as Covered Services for that Member . This will occur only if Tufts Health Plan determines, in its sole discretion, that a ll of the following conditions are satisfied: the Member's condition is expected to require medi cal treatment for an extended duration; the alternative services and supplies are Medically Necessary ; the alternative services and supplie s are provided directly to the Member with the condition; the alternative services and supplies are in plac e of more expensive treatment that qualifies as Covered Services ; the Member and Tufts Health Plan or its designee agree to the alte rnative treatment program; and the Member continues to show improvement in his or her condition. Tufts Health Plan or its designee will determine this periodically. We may approve an ICM plan. If this happens, we will also indicate the Covered Service that the ICM plan will replace. The benefit available for the ICM plan will be limited to the benefit that the Member would have received for the Covered Service . We will periodically monitor the appropriateness of the alternative services and supplies provided to the Member . We may decide, at any time, that these services and supplies fail to satisfy any of the conditions described above.

We do this for cost, safety and/or clinical reasons. Prior Authorization Program: We restrict the coverage of certain drug produc ts. These are drugs with a narrow indication for usage, may have safety concerns and/or are extremely expensive. We require the prescribing Provider to obtain prior approval from us for such drugs. Step Therapy PA Program Step therapy is a type of prior authorization program. (This is usually automated.) This program uses a step-wise approach.

Drugs may not be covered for safety reasons, if they are new on the market, if they become available over-the-counter, or if a gener ic version of a drug becomes available. All of the alternative drug products ar e approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Membership Termination for Misrepresentation or Fraud Policy We may terminate your coverage for misrepresent ation or fraud during the first two years of coverage under this plan.

In this case, Tufts Health Plan , at its option, may: pay the Provider for those services and ask you to pay us back; or not pay for those services. In this case, you will have to pay the Provider for the services. The Premium may be more than is needed to pay for Covered Services you received after your termination date.

Chapter 5 Continuation of Group Contract Coverage and Conversion Privilege Federal Continuation Coverage (COBRA) Rules for federal COBRA continuation Under the Federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), you may be eligible to continue coverage after Group coverage ends if you were enrolled in Tufts Health Plan through a Group which as 20 or more eligible employees and you experience a qualifying event (see list below) which would cause you to lose coverage under your Group . Note : Same-sex marriages legally entered into in Massachusetts are not recognized under federal law. Federal COBRA continuation pr ovisions therefore do not apply to same-sex Spouses . Check with your employer to see if CO BRA-like benefits are available to you. Qualifying Events A qualifying event is defined as: the Subscriber's death; termination of the Subscriber's employment for any reason other than gross misconduct; reduction in the Subscriber's work hours; the Subscriber's divorce or legal separation; the Subscriber's entitlement to Medicare; or the Subscriber's or Spouse's enrolled Dependent ceases to be a Dependent Child . If a Member experiences a qualifying event, he or she may be eligible to continue Group coverage as a Subscriber or an enrolled Dependent under federal COBRA law as described below. When federal COBRA coverage is effective A Member who is eligible for federal COBRA cont inuation coverage (a \"qualified beneficiary\") must be given an election period of 60 days to choose whether to elect federal COBRA continuation coverage. This period is measur ed from the later of the date the qualified beneficiary's coverage under the Group Contract ends (see the list of qualifying events described above); or the date the plan provides the qualified beneficiary with a COBRA election notice. A qualified beneficiary's federal COBRA continuation coverage becomes effective retroactive to the start of the election period, if he or she elects and pays for that coverage. Cost of Coverage In most cases, you are responsible for payment of 102% of the cost of coverage for the federal COBRA continuation coverage. (See \"Important Note\" in the \"Duration of Coverage\" table below for information about when you may be respons ible for payment of more than 102% of the cost of COBRA coverage.) For more information, contact your Group . Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 5-2 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Federal Continuation Coverage (COBRA), continued Duration of Coverage Qualified beneficiaries are eligible for federal CO BRA continuation coverage, in most cases, for a period of 18 or 36 months from the date of the qualifying event, depending on the type of qualifying event. Generally, COBRA coverage is available for a maximum of 18 months for qualifying events due to employment termination or reduction of work hours. Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of co verage, may permit a qualified beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of COBRA continuation coverage. For more information, see the \"Duration of Coverage\" table below. FEDERAL COBRA - DURATION OF COVERAGE Qualifying Event(s) Qualified Beneficiaries Maximum Period of Coverage Termination of Subscriber's employment for any reason other than gross misconduct. Reduction in the Subscriber's work hours. Subscriber, Spouse , and Dependent Children 18 months* Subscriber's divorce, legal separation, entitlement to Medicare, or death. Spouse and Dependent Children 36 months Subscriber's or Spouse's enrolled Dependent ceases to be a Dependent Child .Dependent Child 36 months *Important Note: If a qualified beneficiary is determined under the federal Social Security Act to have been disabled within the first 60 days of federal COBRA continuation coverage for these qualifying event s, then that qualified beneficiary and all of the qualified beneficiaries in his or her family may be able to extend COBRA coverage for up to an additional 11 months. You may be responsible for payment of up to 150% of the cost of COBRA coverage for th is additional period of up to 11 months. When coverage ends Federal COBRA continuation coverage will end at t he end of the maximum period of coverage. However, coverage may end earlier if: Coverage costs are not paid on a timely basis. Your Group ceases to maintain any group health plan. After the COBRA election, the qualified benefic iary obtains coverage with another employer group health plan that does not contain any ex clusion or pre-existing condition of such beneficiary. However, if other group health coverage is obtained prior to the COBRA election, COBRA coverage may not be disconti nued, even if the other coverage continues after the COBRA election. After the COBRA election, the qualified benefic iary becomes entitled to federal Medicare benefits. However, if Medicare is obtained pr ior to COBRA election, COBRA coverage may not be discontinued, even if the other cove rage continues after the COBRA election.

The period of this continuat ion will be for up to eighteen (18) months from your termination date. The continuati on period cannot exceed the shorter of: the period that represents the period of your continuous empl oyment preceding termination with your Group; or the time from your termination date until the date that you or any other covered Member under your plan becomes employed by another employer and eligible for benefits under another group plan. Note : We must receive the applicable Premium in order to continue coverage under this provision. Rhode Island Conversion Privilege You may be entitled to enroll in a separate health benefit contract (\"converted contract\") if your coverage under this Group Contract : has been terminated for any reason other than discontinuance of the Group Contract in its entirety or with respect to an insured class; and you have been continuously covered under the Group Contract (and under any employer contract providing similar benefits which it had replaced) for at least three (3) months immediately prior to termination.

The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) The Uniformed Services Employment and Reempl oyment Rights Act (USERRA) protects the job rights of individuals who voluntarily or involunt arily leave employment positions to undertake military service or certain types of service in the National Disaster Medical System. USERRA also prohibits employers from discriminat ing against past and present members of the uniformed services, and applicants to the uniformed services. Under USERRA: You have the right to be reemployed in your ci vilian job if you leave that job to perform service in the uniformed service, and (1) y ou ensure that your employer receives advance written or verbal notice of your serv ice; (2) you have five years or less of cumulative service in the uniformed service while with that particular employer' (3) you return to work or apply for reemployment in a timely manner after conclusion of service; and (4) you have not been separated from servic e with a disqualifying discharge or under other than honorable conditions. If you are e ligible to be reemployed, you must be restored to the job and benefits you would have attained if you have not been absent due to military service or, in some cases, a comparable job. If you are a past or present member of the uniformed services, have applied for membership in the uniformed services, or are obligated to serve in the uniformed services, then an employer may not deny you initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benef it of employment because of this status. In addition, an employer may not retaliate agai nst anyone assisting in the enforcement of USERRA rights, including testifying or making a statement in connection with a proceeding under USERRA, even if that person has no service connection. If you leave your job to perform military servic e, you have the right to elect to continue your existing employer-based health plan coverage for you and your Dependents for up to 24 months while in the military. If you don't elect to continue coverage during your military service, you have the right to be reinstated in your employer's health pl an when you are reemployed, generally without any waiting periods or exclusions (for exam ple, pre-existing conditi on exclusions) except for service-connected illnesses or injuries. Service members may be required to pay up to 102% of the premium for the health plan coverage. If coverage is for less than 31 days, the service member is only required to pay the employee share, if any, for such coverage. USERRA coverage runs concurrently with COBRA and other state continuation coverage. The U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans' Empl oyment and Training Service (VETS) is authorized to investigate and resolve complaints of USERRA violations. For assistance in filing a complaint, or for any other information on USERRA, contact VETS at 1-866-4-USA-DOL, or visit its WEB site at www.dol.gove/vets . If you file a complaint with VETS and VETS is unable to resolve it, you may request that your case be referred to the Department of Justice of repres entation. You may also bypass the VETS process and bring a civil action against an employer for violations of USERRA. The rights listed here may vary depending on the circumstances.

This Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") provision applies to This Plan when an employee or the employee's covered dependent has health care coverage under more than one Plan. \"Plan\" and \"This Plan\" are defined below. B. If this COB provision applies, the order of benefit determination rules should be looked at first. Those rules determine whether the benefit s of \"This Plan\" are determined before or after those of another plan. The benefits of \"This Plan\": (1) shall not be reduced when, under the order of benefit determination rules, \"This Plan\" determines its benefits bef ore another plan; but (2) may be reduced when, under the order of benefits determination rules, another plan determines its benefits first. The above reduction is described in the \"Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" \" section below. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 7-5 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Definitions A. \"Plan\" is any of the following which provides benefits or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (1) Group insurance or group-type coverage whet her insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, group practice or individual practi ce coverage. It also includes coverage other than school accident-type coverage. (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or cove rage required to be provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (T itle XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs, of the Un ited States Social Security Act, as amended from time to time). Each contract or other arrangement for coverage under (1) or (2) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate plan. B. \"This Plan\" is the part of the Group Contract that provides benefits for health care expenses. C. \"Primary Plan/Secondary Plan:\" The order of benefit determination rules state whether \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan as to another plan covering the person. When \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan, its benefits ar e determined before those of the other plan and without considering the other plan's benefits. When \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan, its benefits are determined after those of the other plan and may be reduced because of the other plan's benefits. When there are more t han two plans covering the person, \"This Plan\" may be a Primary Plan as to one or more other plans, and may be a Secondary Plan as to a different plan or plans. D. \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessary, r easonable and customary item of expense for health care; when the item of expense is cove red at least in part by one or more plans covering the person for whom the claim is m ade. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi -private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense under the above definition unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is medically necessary either in terms of generally accepted medical practice, or as specifically defined in the plan. When a plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service r endered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. E. \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar y ear. However, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no cover age under \"This Plan\", or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 7-6 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Order of Benefit Determination Rules A. General. When there is a basis for a clai m under \"This Plan\" and another plan, \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan which has its benefits determi ned after those of the other plan, unless: (1) The other plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those of \"This Plan\"; and (2) Both those rules and \"This Plan\"'s rules, in Subsection B below, require that \"This Plan\"'s benefits be determined before t hose of the other plan. B. Rules. \"This Plan\" determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules which applies: (1) Non-Dependent/Dependent. The benefits of the plan which covers the person as an employee, member or subscriber (that is, other than as a dependent) are determined before those of the plan which covers the person as a dependent. (2) Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divor ced. Except as stated in Paragraph B(3) below, when \"This Plan\" and another plan cover the same child as a dependent of different person, called \"parents:\" (a) The benefits of the plan of the parent w hose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before those of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; but (b) If both parents have the same birthday, t he benefits of the plan which covered the parents longer are determined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. However, if the other plan does not have the rule described in (a) immediately above, but instead has the rule based upon the gender of the patient, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other plan will determine the order of benefits. (3) Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced. If two or more plans cover a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parent s, benefits for the child are determined in this order: (a) First, the plan of the parent with custody of the child; (b) Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and (c) Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a cour t decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. The plan of the other parent shall be the Secondary Plan. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any Claim Determination Period or Plan year during which any benefits are actually paid or provided before the entity has that actual knowledge.

Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Order of Benefit Determination Rules , continued (4) Joint Custody. If the specific terms of a court decree state that the parents shall share joint custody, without stating that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering t he child shall follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined above in Pa ragraph B(2) of this section. (5) Active/Inactive Employee. The benefits of a plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (o r as that employee's dependent) are determined before those of a plan which covers that pers on as a laid off or retired employee (or as that employee's dependent). If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this Rule (5) is ignored. (6) Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the pl an which covered an employee, member or subscriber longer are determined before thos e of the Plan which covered that person for the shorter term. Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" A. When This Section Applies. This section applies when, in accordanc e with the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section above, \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan as to one or more other plans. In that event the benefit s of \"This Plan\" may be reduced under this section. Such other plan or plans are referred to as \"the other plans\" in B immediately below. B. Reduction in \"This Plan\"'s Benefits. T he benefits of \"This Plan\" will be reduced when the sum of: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under \"This Plan\" in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that would be payable for the A llowable Expenses under the other plans, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this CO B provision, whether or not claim is made, exceeds those Allowable Ex penses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the benefits of \"This Plan\" will be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under the other plans do not total more than those Allowable Expenses. When the benefits of \"This Plan\" are reduced as described above, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any app licable benefit limit of \"This Plan\".

Tufts Health Plan need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under \"This Plan\" must give Tufts Health Plan any facts it needs to pay the claim. Facility of Payment A payment made under another plan may incl ude an amount which should have been paid under \"This Plan\". If it does, Tufts Health Plan may pay that amount to the organization which made that payment. That amount will then be tr eated as though it were a benefit paid under \"This Plan\". Tufts Health Plan will not have to pay that amount again.

Most plans are ERISA plans, but not all. Please contact your plan administrator to determine if your plan is an ERISA plan. ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to receive information about their plan and benefits, continue group health plan coverage, and prudent actions by plan fiduciaries. Receiving Information About Your Plan and Benefits ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to: Examine, without charge, at the plan administrator's office and at other specified locations all documents governing the plan, including insu rance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and a copy of the latest annual r eport (Form 5500 Series) filed by the plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Discl osure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration. Obtain, upon written request to the plan adminis trator, copies of documents governing the operation of the plan, including insurance c ontracts and collective bargaining agreements, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and updated summary plan description. The plan administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies. Receive a summary of the plan's annual financia l report.

B-2 To contact Member Se rvices, call 1-800-682-8059, or see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. ERISA RIGHTS, continued Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for plan partici pants ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the pl an. The people who operate your plan, called ``fiduciaries'' of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a plan benefit or exerci sing your rights under ERISA. Enforcing Your Rights If your claim for a plan benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a feder al court. In such a case, the court may require the plan administrator to provide the material s and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not s ent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits whic h is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qua lified status of a domestic rela tions order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in federal cour t. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these co sts and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. Assistance with Your Questions If you have any questions about your plan, you should contact the plan administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the plan administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Admini stration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. D epartment of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the public ations hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

Military Caregiver Leave: An eligible employ ee who is the spouse, son, daughter parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty is entit led to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12- month period to care for the servicemember. T he employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks for all types of FMLA leave in the single 12-month period. In order to be eligible, the employee must have wo rked for his or her employer for a total of 12 months and worked at least 1,250 hour s over the previous 12 months. A covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage for an employee on FMLA leave whenever such insurance was pr ovided before the leave was taken and on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. If applicable, arrangements will need to be made for employees to pay their share of heal th insurance premiums while on leave. In some instances, the employer may recover premiu ms it paid to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from FMLA leave. An employee should contact his or her employer for details about FMLA and to make payment arrangements, if applicable. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A.

The following describes the types of uses and disclosures of PHI that federal law permits us to make without your specific authorization: Treatment: We may use and disclose your PHI to health care providers to help them treat you. For example, our care managers may disclose PHI to a home health care agency to make sure you get the services you need after discharge from a hospital. Payment Purposes: We use and disclose your PHI for payment purposes, such as paying doctors and hospitals for covered services. Payment purposes also include activities such as: determining eligibility fo r benefits; reviewing services for medical performing utilization review; obt aining premiums; coordinating benefits; subrogation; and collection activities. Health Care Operations: We use and disclose your PHI for health care operations. This includes coordinating/managing care; assessing an d improving the quality of health care services; reviewing the qualifications and perfo rmance of providers; reviewing health plan performance; conducting medical reviews; and resolving grievances. It also includes business activities such as: underwriting; rating; placing or replacing coverage; determining coverage policies; business planni ng; obtaining reinsurance; arranging for legal and auditing services (including fraud and abuse detection programs); and obtaining accreditations and licenses. Health and Wellness Information: We may use your PHI to contact you with information about appointment reminders; treatm ent alternatives; therapies; health care providers; settings of care; or other health -related benefits, services and products that may be of interest to you. For example, we might send you information about smoking cessation programs. Organizations That Assist Us: In connection with treatment, payment and health care operations, we may share your PHI with our affiliates and third-party \"business associates\" that perform activities for us or on our behalf, for example, our pharmacy benefit manager. We will obtain assurances from our business associates that they will appropriately safeguard your information. Plan Sponsors: If you are enrolled in Tufts Health Plan through your current or former place of work, you are enrolled in a group health plan. We may disclose PHI to the group health plan's plan sponsor\u2014 usually your em ployer\u2014for plan administration purposes. The plan sponsor must certify that it will protect the PHI in accordance with law. Public Health and Safety; Health Oversight : We may disclose your PHI to a public health authority for public health activities , such as responding to public health investigations; when authorized by law, to appropriate authorities, if we reasonably believe you are a victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence; when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to prevent or le ssen a serious and imminent threat to your or others' health or safety; or to health oversi ght agencies for certain activities such as audits, disciplinary actions and licensure activity. Legal Process; Law Enforcement; Specialized Government Activities: We may disclose your PHI in the course of legal pr oceedings; in certain cases, in response to a subpoena, discovery request or other lawful proce ss; to law enforcement officials for such purposes as responding to a warrant or subpoena; or for specialized governmental activities such as national security.

In these cases we will only disclose the PHI that is directly relevant to the person's involvement in your health care or payment related to your health care. Personal Representatives: Unless prohibited by law, we may disclose your PHI to your personal representative, if any. A personal r epresentative has legal authority to act on your behalf in making decisions related to your health care. For example, a health care proxy, or a parent or guardi an of an unemancipated minor are personal representatives. Mailings: We will mail information containing PHI to the address we have on record for the subscriber of your health benefits pl an.

You may give us written authorization to use or disclose your PHI to anyone for any purpose. You may later change your mind and revoke your authorizat ion in writing. However, your written revocation will not affect actions we've already taken in reliance on your authorization.

For exam ple, under certain circumstances, records that contain information about alcohol abuse treatment; drug abuse prevention or treatment; AIDS-related testing or treatmen t; or certain privileged communications may not be disclosed without your wr itten authorization. In addition, when applicable we must have your written authorizat ion before using or disclos ing medical or treatment information for a member appeal. See below , \"Who to Contact for Questions or Complaints,\" if you would like more information.

The Rhode Island calendar yea r 2012 projection, using year -to-date claims and premium experience , is running more favorabl y than what was expected in pricing, after a djusting for the impact of the high cost claims . Small group claims are 3.8% below the expected level, and large group claims are 2.3% below. The current OHIC approved 2013 THP base rates include lower administrative expenses than we believe to be adequate . The lower administrative expenses account for 0.6% of the small group base rate and 1.4% of the large group base ra te. Tufts Health Plan wishes to balance the need for adequate premium with the need for competitive rates in order to gain more membership and remain an active player in the Rhode Island market. With all the above consideration s, THP is requesting a red uction in base rates of 3.2% for small group and 1.0% for large group, effective as soon as practically possible . The Affordable Care Act includes a mandated Women's Preventive Health Services benefit that was effective August 1, 2012. The mandate require s insurance carriers to cover contraceptive drugs and procedures and breastfeeding support services in full with no member cost sharing. THP has analyzed the incremental cost of the mandated benefits and determined that a benefit factor increase of 0.6% wi ll need to be applied to all plans. THP is requesting permission to include this benefit factor increase for both manual and experience rated plans. I certify that the actuarial analys es cited above were developed using sound actuarial assumptions and met hodologies. _________________________ Jen Stevenson , F.S.A., M.A.A.A.

About Your Primary Care Provider Importance of choosing a PCP Each Member must choose a PCP when he or she enrolls. The PCP you choose will be associated with a specific Tufts Health Plan Provider Organization . You will usually receive Covered Services from health care professionals and facilities associated with that Tufts Health Plan Provider Organization . Once you have chosen a PCP, you are eligible for all Covered Services . IMPORTANT NOTE : Until you have chosen a PCP, only Emergency care is covered. What a PCP does A PCP: (1) provides routine health care (This in cludes routine physical examinations.); (2) arranges for your care with other Tufts Health Plan Providers , ; and (3) provides referrals for other health care services. See \" Inpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" and \"Outpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" later in this chapter. Those section have more information about obtaining referrals for these services. Your PCP, or a Covering Provider , is available 24 hours a day. Your PCP will coordinate your care by treating you or referring you to specialty services. Choosing a PCP You must choose a PCP from the list of PCPs in our Directory of Health Care Providers . You may already have a Provider who is listed as a PCP. In most instances you may choose him or her as your PCP. Once you choose a PCP in our network , you must inform us of your choice. This is required for you to be eligible for all Covered Services. You may not have a PCP. Or, your PCP may not be not listed in our Directory of Health Care Providers , . In either case, call a Member Specialist for help in choosing a PCP. [Note : Under certain circumstances required by law, if your Provider is not in our network, you will be covered for a short period of time for services provided by your Provider . A Member Specialist can give you more information. Please see \"Continuity of Care\" above.] Contacting your new PCP If you choose a new Provider as your PCP, you should: Contact your new PCP as soon as you join.

The new Provider will not be considered your PCP until: you choose a new PCP from our Directory of Health Care Providers ; you report your choice to a Member Specialist; and we approve the change in your PCP. Note : You may not change your PCP while an Inpatient or in a partial hospitalization program, except when approved by Tufts Health Plan in limited circumstances.

Your Provider's office may charge for missed appointments that you did not cancel in advance. If this happens, we will not pay for the charges. Referrals for specialty services Every PCP is associated with a specific Provider Organization . If you need to see a specialist (including a pediatric specialist), your PCP will select the specialist and make the referral. Usually, your PCP will select and refer you to another Provider in the same Provider Organization (as defined in Appendix A). The PCP and the specialists already have a working relationship; as a result, this helps to provide quality and continuity of care. You may need specialty care not available within your PCP's Provider Organization This is a rare event. If this happens, your PCP will choose a specialist in another Provider Organization and make the referral. When selecting a specialist for you, your PCP will consider: (1) any long- standing relationships that you have with any Tufts Health Plan Provider ; and (2) your clinical needs. (A long-standing relationship means that you have recently been seen or been treated repeatedly by that Tufts HP specialist.)

Financial Arrangements between Tufts Health Plan and Tufts Health Plan Providers Methods of payment to Tufts Health Plan Providers Our goal in paying Providers is to encourage preventive care and active illness management. We strive to be sure that our financial reimbur sement system: (1) encourages appropriate access to care; (2) and rewards Providers for providing high quality care to our Members . We use a variety of mutually agreed upon methods to compensate Tufts Health Plan Providers . The Tufts Health Plan Directory of Health Care Providers indicates the method of payment for each Provider . Regardless of the method of payment, we expect all participating Providers to use sound medical judgment when providing care and when determining whether a referral for specialty care is appropriate. This approach encourages the provision of Medically Necessary care and reduces the number of unnecessary medi cal tests and procedures that can be both harmful and costly to Members . We review the quality of care provided to our Members through our Quality of Health Care Program. Feel free to discuss with your Provider specific questions about how he or she is paid. Member Identification Card Introduction Tufts Health Plan gives each Member a member identification card (Member ID). Reporting errors When you receive your Member ID card, check it carefully. If any information is wrong, call a Member Specialist. Identifying yourself as a Tufts Health Plan Member Your Member ID card is important; it identifies you as a Tufts Health Plan Member . Please: carry your Member ID card at all times; have your Member ID card with you for m edical, hospital and other appointments; and show your Member ID card to any Provider before you receive health care services. When you receive services, tell the office staff that you are a Tufts Health Plan Member . IMPORTANT NOTE : Identify yourself as a Tufts Health Plan Member . If you do not, then: we may not pay for the services provided; and you would be responsible for the costs. Membership requirement You are eligible for benefits if you are a Member when you receive care. A Member ID card alone is not enough to get you benefits.

Utilization Management Tufts Health Plan has a utilization management program. The purpose of the program is to control health care costs. It does this by evaluat ing whether health care services provided to Members are: (1) Medically Necessary; and (2) provided in the most appropriate and efficient manner. [Under this program, we sometimes engage in prospective, concurrent, and retrospective review of health care services.] [We use prospective review to determine if proposed treatment is Medically Necessary . This review happens before that treatment begins. Prospec tive review is also referred to as \"Pre- Service Review\". We engage in concurrent review . We do this to: monitor the course of treatment as it occurs; and to determine when that treatment is no longer Medically Necessary . We use retrospective review to evaluate care after it is provided.Sometimes, we use retrospective review to mo re accurately decide if a Member's health care services are appropriate. Retrospective review is al so called \"Post-Service Review\". ] [ TIMEFRAMES FOR TUFTS HEALTH PLAN TO REVIEW YOUR COVERAGE REQUEST: Type of Review: Timeframe for Determinations:* Prospective (Pre-Service).

Utilization Management, continued Individual case management (ICM) In certain circumstances, Tufts Health Plan may approve an individual case management (\"ICM\") plan for a Member with a Severe Illness or Injury. The ICM plan is designed to arrange for the most appropriate type, level, and setting of health care services and supplies for the Member . As a part of the ICM plan, we may approve cover age for alternative services and supplies that do not otherwise qualify as Covered Services for that Member . This will occur only if Tufts Health Plan determines, in its sole discretion, that a ll of the following conditions are satisfied: the Member's condition is expected to require medi cal treatment for an extended duration; the alternative services and supplies are Medically Necessary ; the alternative services and supplie s are provided directly to the Member with the condition; the alternative services and supplies are in place of more expensive treatment that qualifies as Covered Services ; the Member and Tufts Health Plan or its designee agree to the al ternative treatment program; and the Member continues to show improvement in his or her condition. Tufts Health Plan or its designee will determine this periodically. We may approve an ICM plan. If this happens, we will also indicate the Covered Service that the ICM plan will replace. The benefit available for the ICM plan will be limited to the benefit that the Member would have received for the Covered Service . We will periodically monitor the appropriateness of the alternative services and supplies provided to the Member . We may decide, at any time, that these services and supplies fail to satisfy any of the conditions described above. In this event, we may modify or terminate coverage for the services or supplies provided pursuant to the ICM plan.

Chapter 5 Continuation of Group Contract Coverage and Conversion Privilege Federal Continuation Coverage (COBRA) Rules for federal COBRA continuation Under the Federal Consolidated Omnibus B udget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), you may be eligible to continue coverage after Group coverage ends if you were enrolled in Tufts Health Plan through a Group which as 20 or more eligible employees and you experience a qualifying event (see list below) which would cause you to lose coverage under your Group . Note : Same-sex marriages legally entered into in Massachusetts are not recognized under federal law. Federal COBRA continuation pr ovisions therefore do not apply to same-sex Spouses . Check with your employer to see if CO BRA-like benefits are available to you. Qualifying Events A qualifying event is defined as: the Subscriber's death; termination of the Subscriber's employment for any reason other than gross misconduct; reduction in the Subscriber's work hours; the Subscriber's divorce or legal separation; the Subscriber's entitlement to Medicare; or the Subscriber's or Spouse's enrolled Dependent ceases to be a Dependent Child . If a Member experiences a qualifying event, he or she may be eligible to continue Group coverage as a Subscriber or an enrolled Dependent under federal COBRA law as described below. When federal COBRA coverage is effective A Member who is eligible for federal COBRA cont inuation coverage (a \"qualified beneficiary\") must be given an election period of 60 days to choose whether to elect federal COBRA continuation coverage. This period is measur ed from the later of the date the qualified beneficiary's coverage under the Group Contract ends (see the list of qualifying events described above); or the date the plan provides the qualif ied beneficiary with a COBRA election notice. A qualified beneficiary's federal COBRA continuation coverage becomes effective retroactive to the start of the election period, if he or she elects and pays for that coverage. Cost of Coverage In most cases, you are responsible for payment of 102% of the cost of coverage for the federal COBRA continuation coverage. (S ee \"Important Note\" in the \"Dur ation of Coverage\" table below for information about when you may be responsible for payment of more than 102% of the cost of COBRA coverage.)

Federal Continuation Coverage (COBRA), continued Duration of Coverage Qualified beneficiaries are eligible for federal CO BRA continuation coverage, in most cases, for a period of 18 or 36 months from the date of the qualifying event, depending on the type of qualifying event. Generally, COBRA coverage is available for a maximum of 18 months for qualifying events due to employment termination or reduction of work hours. Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of co verage, may permit a qualified beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of COBRA continuation coverage. For more information, see the \"Duration of Coverage\" table below. FEDERAL COBRA - DURATION OF COVERAGE Qualifying Event(s) Qualified Beneficiaries Maximum Period of Coverage Termination of Subscriber's employment for any reason other than gross misconduct. Reduction in the Subscriber's work hours. Subscriber, Spouse , and Dependent Children 18 months* Subscriber's divorce, legal separation, entitlement to Medicare, or death. Spouse and Dependent Children 36 months Subscriber's or Spouse's enrolled Dependent ceases to be a Dependent Child .Dependent Child 36 months *Important Note: If a qualified beneficiary is determined under the federal Social Security Act to have been disabled within the first 60 days of federal COBRA continuation coverage for these qualifying event s, then that qualified beneficiary and all of the qualified beneficiaries in his or her family may be able to extend COBRA coverage for up to an additional 11 months. You may be responsible for payment of up to 150% of the cost of COBRA coverage for th is additional period of up to 11 months. When coverage ends Federal COBRA continuation coverage will end at t he end of the maximum period of coverage. However, coverage may end earlier if: Coverage costs are not paid on a timely basis. Your Group ceases to maintain any group health plan. After the COBRA election, the qualified benefic iary obtains coverage with another employer group health plan that does not contain any ex clusion or pre-existing condition of such beneficiary. However, if other group health cove rage is obtained prior to the COBRA election, COBRA coverage may not be discontinued, even if the other coverage continues after the COBRA election. After the COBRA election, the qualified benefic iary becomes entitled to federal Medicare benefits. However, if Medicare is obtained prior to COBRA election, COBRA coverage may not be discontinued, even if the other cove rage continues after the COBRA election.

The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) The Uniformed Services Employment and Reempl oyment Rights Act (USERRA) protects the job rights of individuals who voluntarily or involunt arily leave employment positions to undertake military service or certain types of service in the National Disaster Medical System. USERRA also prohibits employers from discriminating against past and present members of the uniformed services, and applicants to the uniformed services. Under USERRA: You have the right to be reemployed in your ci vilian job if you leave that job to perform service in the uniformed service, and (1) you ensure that your employer receives advance written or verbal notice of your service; (2 ) you have five years or less of cumulative service in the uniformed service while with that particular employer' (3) you return to work or apply for reemployment in a timely manner after conclusion of service; and (4) you have not been separated from service with a dis qualifying discharge or under other than honorable conditions. If you are eligible to be reemployed, you must be restored to the job and benefits you would have attained if you have not been absent due to military service or, in some cases, a comparable job. If you are a past or present member of the uniformed services, have applied for membership in the uniformed services, or are obligated to serve in the uniformed services, then an employer may not deny you initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment because of this status. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against anyone a ssisting in the enforcement of USERRA rights, including testifying or making a st atement in connection with a proceeding under USERRA, even if that person has no service connection. If you leave your job to perform military service, you have the right to elect to continue your existing employer-based health plan coverage for you and your Dependents for up to 24 months while in the military. If you don't elect to continue coverage during your military service, you have the right to be reinstated in your employer's health plan w hen you are reemployed, generally without any waiting periods or exclusions (for example, pre-existing condition ex clusions) except for service-connected illnesses or injuries. Service members may be required to pay up to 102% of the premium for the health plan coverage. If coverage is for less than 31 days, the service member is only required to pay the employee share, if any, for such coverage. USERRA coverage runs concurrently with CO BRA and other state c ontinuation coverage. The U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans' Empl oyment and Training Service (VETS) is authorized to investigate and resolve complaints of USERRA violations. For assistance in filing a complaint, or for any other information on USERRA, contact VETS at 1- 866-4-USA-DOL, or visit its WEB site at www.dol.gove/vets. If you file a complaint with VETS and VETS is unable to resolve it, you may request that your case be referred to the Department of Justice of representation. You may also bypass the VETS process and bring a civil action against an employer for violations of USERRA. The rights listed here may vary depending on the circumstances.

This Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") provision applies to This Plan when an employee or the employee's covered dependent has health care coverage under more than one Plan. \"Plan\" and \"This Plan\" are defined below. B. If this COB provision applies, the order of benef it determination rules should be looked at first. Those rules determine whether the benefits of \"This Plan\" are determined before or after those of another plan. T he benefits of \"This Plan\": (1) shall not be reduced when, under the order of benefit determination rules, \"This Plan\" determines its benefits bef ore another plan; but (2) may be reduced when, under the order of benefits determination rules, another plan determines its benefits first. The above reduction is described in the \"Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" \" section below. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 7-5 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com . Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits, continued Definitions A. \"Plan\" is any of the following which provides benefits or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (1) Group insurance or group-type coverage whet her insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, group practice or individual prac tice coverage. It also includes coverage other than school accident-type coverage. (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or cove rage required to be provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (T itle XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs, of the Un ited States Social Security Act, as amended from time to time). Each contract or other arrangement for coverage under (1) or (2) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate plan. B. \"This Plan\" is the part of the Group Contract that provides benefits for health care expenses. C. \"Primary Plan/Secondary Plan:\" The order of benefit determination rules state whether \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan as to another plan covering the person. When \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan, its benefits ar e determined before those of the other plan and without considering the other pl an's benefits. When \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan, its benefits are determined after those of the ot her plan and may be reduced because of the other plan's benefits. When there are more t han two plans covering the person, \"This Plan\" may be a Primary Plan as to one or more other plans, and may be a Secondary Plan as to a different plan or plans. D. \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessary, r easonable and customary item of expense for health care; when the item of expense is cove red at least in part by one or more plans covering the person for whom the claim is m ade. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi-p rivate hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense under the above definition unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is medically necessary either in terms of generally accepted medical practice, or as specifically defined in the plan. When a plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. E. \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar y ear. However, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no cover age under \"This Plan\", or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 7-6 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com . Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Order of Benefit Determination Rules A. General. When there is a basis for a claim under \"This Plan\" and another plan, \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan which has its benefits determined after those of the other plan, unless: (1) The other plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those of \"This Plan\"; and (2) Both those rules and \"This Plan's rules, in Subsection B below, require that \"This Plan\"'s benefits be determined before t hose of the other plan. B. Rules. \"This Plan\" determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules which applies: (1) Non-Dependent/Dependent. The benefits of the plan which covers the person as an employee, member or subscriber (that is, other than as a dependent) are determined before those of the plan which covers the person as a dependent. (2) Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced. Except as stated in Paragraph B(3) below, when \"This Plan\" and another plan cover the same child as a dependent of different person, called \"parents:\" (a) The benefits of the plan of the parent w hose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before those of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; but (b) If both parents have the same birthday, t he benefits of the plan which covered the parents longer are determined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. However, if the other plan does not have t he rule described in (a) immediately above, but instead has the rule based upon the gender of the patient, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other plan will determine the order of benefits. (3) Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced. If two or more plans cover a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child are determined in this order: (a) First, the plan of the parent with custody of the child; (b) Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and (c) Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a cour t decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. The plan of the other parent shall be the Secondary Plan. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any Claim Determination Period or Plan year during which any benefits ar e actually paid or provided before the entity has that actual knowledge. (4) Joint Custody. If the specific terms of a court decree state that the parents shall share joint custody, without stating that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering t he child shall follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined above in Pa ragraph B(2) of this section. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 7-7 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com . Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits, continued (5) Active/Inactive Employee. The benefits of a plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as that employee's dependent) are determined before those of a plan which covers that person as a laid off or retired employee (or as that employee's dependent). If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benef its, this Rule (5) is ignored. (6) Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the pl an which covered an employee, member or subscriber longer are determined before those of the Plan which covered that person for the shorter term. Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" A. When This Section Applies. This section applies when, in accordance with the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section above, \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan as to one or more other plans. In that event the benefits of \"This Plan\" may be reduced under this section. Such other plan or plans are referred to as \"the other plans\" in B immediately below. B. Reduction in \"This Plan\"'s Benefits. The benefits of \"This Plan\" will be reduced when the sum of: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the A llowable Expenses under \"This Plan\" in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that would be payable for the A llowable Expenses under the other plans, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this CO B provision, whether or not claim is made, exceeds those Allowable Ex penses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the benefits of \"This Plan\" will be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under the other plans do not total more than those Allowable Expenses. When the benefits of \"This Plan\" are reduced as de scribed above, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of \"This Plan\". Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules. Tufts Health Plan has the right to decide which facts it needs. It may get needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person. Tufts Health Plan need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under \"This Plan\" must give Tufts Health Plan any facts it needs to pay the claim. Facility of Payment A payment made under another plan may incl ude an amount which should have been paid under \"This Plan\".

ERISA RIGHTS, continued Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for plan partici pants ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the pl an. The people who operate your plan, called ``fiduciaries'' of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including y our employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a plan benefit or exerci sing your rights under ERISA. Enforcing Your Rights If your claim for a plan benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of document s relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a feder al court. In such a case, the court may require the plan administrator to provide the material s and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits whic h is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you Enforcing Your Rights - continued: may file suit in a state or federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualifi ed status of a domestic relations order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in federal cour t. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal f ees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.

PROCESSING OF CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS The Department of Labor's (DOL) Employee Benef its Security Administration has published benefit determination procedure regulations for employee benefit plans governed under ERISA. The regulations set forth requirements with respec t to the processing of claims for plan benefits, including urgent care claims, pre-service claims , post-service claims and review of claims denials. Who can submit a claim? The DOL Regulations apply to claims submitted by ERISA participants or their beneficiaries. In accordance with the regulations, Tufts Heal th Plan permits an authorized representative (referred to here as the \"authorized claimant\") to act on your behalf in submitting a claim or obtaining a review of a claim decision. An aut horized claimant can be any individual (including, for example, a family member, an attorney, et c.) whom you designate to act on your behalf with respect to a claim for benefits. How do I designate an Authorized Claimant? An authorized claimant can be designated at any point in the claims process - at the pre- service, post service or appeal level. Please contact a Tufts Health Plan Member Specialist at 1-800-682-8059 for the specifics on how to appoint an authorized claimant. Types of claims There are several different types of claims that you may submit for review. Tufts Health Plan's procedures for reviewing claims depends upon the ty pe of claim submitted (urgent care claims, pre-service claims, post-service claims, and concurrent care claims). Urgent care claims: An \"urgent care claim\" is a claim for medical care or treatment where the application of the claims review procedure for non- urgent claims: (1) could seriously jeopardize your life, health or ability to regain maximum function, or (2) based upon your Provider's determination, would subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment being requested. For ur gent care claims, we will respond to you within 72 hours after receipt of the claim. If we dete rmine that additional information is needed to review your claim, we will notify you within 24 hours afte r the receipt of the claim and provide you with a description of the additional information needed to evaluate your claim. You have 48 hour after that time to provide the requested informa tion. We will evaluate your claim within 48 hours after the earlier of our receipt of the requested information, or the end of the extension period given to you to provide the requested information. Concurrent care decisions: A \"concurrent care decision\" is a determination relating to the continuation/reduction of an ongoing course of treatment. If we have already approved an ongoing course of treatment for you and consi ders reducing or terminating the treatment, we will notify you sufficiently in advance of the reducti on or termination of treatment to allow you to appeal the decision and obtain a determination before the treatment is reduced or terminated. If you request to extend an ongoing course of tr eatment that involves urgent care, we will respond to you within 24 hours after receipt of the request (provided that you make the request at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the ongoing course of treatment). If you reach the end of a pre-approved course of treatment before requesting additional services, the \"pre- service\" or \"post-service\" time limits will apply.

If we determine that an extension is necessary for a non-urgent request due to matters beyond our control, we will notify you within 15 days info rming you of the circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which we expect to r ender a decision (up to an additional 15 days). If you make a pre-service claim, but do not submit enough information for us to make a determination, we will notify you within 15 days and describe the information that you need to provide to us.

However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if t he attending provider (e.g., your physician, nurse midwife, or physician assistant), after consulta tion with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, plans or issuers may not set the level of benefits or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48-hour (or 96-hou r) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a physician or other health care provider obtain authorization for prescribing a length of stay or up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, you may be required to obtain precertification. For information on precertification, contact your plan administrator.

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT OF 1993 Note : The Family and Medical Leave Act only applies to groups with 50 or more employees. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), if an employee meets the eligibility requirements, that employee is legally allowed to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following reasons: for the birth and care of the newborn child of the employee; for placement with the employee of a s on or daughter for adoption or foster care; to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or to take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition. The FMLA was amended to add two new leave rights re lated to military service, effective January 16, 2009: Qualifying Exigency Leave: Eligible employees ar e entitled to up to 12 weeks of leave because of \"any qualifying exigency\" due to the fact t hat the spouse, son, daught er, or parent of the employee is on active duty, or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status, in support of a contingency operation. Military Caregiver Leave: An eligible employ ee who is the spouse, son, daughter parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty is entit led to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12- month period to care for the servicemember. T he employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks for all types of FMLA leave in the single 12-month period. In order to be eligible, the employee must have wo rked for his or her employer for a total of 12 months and worked at least 1,250 hour s over the previous 12 months. A covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage for an employee on FMLA leave whenever such insurance was provi ded before the leave was taken and on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. If applicable, arrangements will need to be made for employees to pay their share of health in surance premiums while on leave. In some instances, the employer may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from FMLA leave. An employee should contact his or her employer for details about FMLA and to make payment arrangements, if applicable. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A.

The following describes the types of uses and disclosures of PHI that federal law permits us to make without your specific authorization: Treatment: We may use and disclose your PHI to health care providers to help them treat you. For example, our care managers may di sclose PHI to a home health care agency to make sure you get the services you need after discharge from a hospital. Payment Purposes: We use and disclose your PHI for payment purposes, such as paying doctors and hospitals for covered services. Payment purposes also include activities such as: determining eligibility fo r benefits; reviewing services for medical necessity; performing utilization review; obtai ning premiums; coordinating benefits; subrogation; and collection activities.

For example, we might send you information about smoking cessation programs.

In these cases we will only disclose the PHI that is directly relevant to the person's involvement in your health care or payment related to your health care. Personal Representatives: Unless prohibited by law, we may disclose your PHI to your personal representative, if any .

Chapter 1 How Your HMO Plan Works How the Plan Works Primary Care Provider Each Member must choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) who will provide or authorize care. If you do not choose a PCP, we will not pay for any services or supplies except for Emergency care. As described in the \"Overview\" section on pages iii and iv, your selection of a PCP affects your level of benefits under this Evidence of Coverage . Note: If you require non- Emergency health care services, you should always call your PCP. Your will either provide or coordinate your care. You should never wait until your condition becomes an Emergency to call. Covered Services Tufts Health Plan will only pay for Covered Services and supplies when we determine that they are Medically Necessary . The term, Medically Necessary , is defined in Appendix A of this Evidence of Coverage. See Chapter 3 for a description of the Covered Services available under this plan. For many Covered Services , you will first have to meet a Deductible . If you are enrolled in the Advantage Level, your Deductible is a lower amount. If you are instead enrolled in the Basic Level, your Deductible is a higher amount. For certain Covered Services , you will also pay a Copayment after you meet your Deductible . For more information about your Member costs for medical services, see \"Benefit Overview\" at the front of this Evidence of Coverage . Service Area (see Appendix A) In most cases, you must receive care in the Tufts Health Plan Service Area . (The Service Area is defined in Appendix A. It incl udes both the Standard and Extended Service Area ). The exceptions are for an Emergency , or Urgent Care while traveling outside of the Service Area . See the Tufts Health Plan Directory of Health Care Providers for Tufts Health Plan's Service Area . In rare events, a service cannot be provided by a Tufts Health Plan Provider in either the Standard or Extended Service Area. In those instances, call a Member Specialist for assistance. You can also visit our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com . Provider network We offer Members access to an extensive network of physicians, hospitals, and other Providers throughout the Service Area . We work to ensure the continued availability of our Providers. However, our network of Providers may change during the year. This can happen for many reasons. Those reasons include: a Provider's retirement; moving out of the Service Area ; or failure to continue to meet our credentialing standards. This can also happen if Tufts Health Plan and the Provider are unable to reach agreement on a contract. This is because Providers are independent contractors; they do not work for us. For questions about the availability of a Provider , call a Member Specialist. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-2 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. How the Plan Works , continued Coverage IF you... AND you are...

Emergency and Urgent Care Emergency Care Definition of Emergency : See Appendix A. Follow these guidelines for receiving Emergency care If needed, call 911 for emergency medical assistance. 911 services may not be available in your area. In this event, call the local number for emergency medical services. Go to the nearest emergency medical facility. You do not need approval from your PCP before receiving Emergency care. If you receive Outpatient Emergency care at an emergency facility, you or someone acting for you should call your PCP or Tufts Health Plan within 48 hours after receiving care.

About Your Primary Care Provider Importance of choosing a PCP Each Member must choose a PCP when he or she enrolls. The PCP you choose will be associated with a specific Tufts Health Plan Provider Organization . You will usually receive Covered Services from health care professionals and facilities associated with that Tufts Health Plan Provider Organization . Once you have chosen a PCP, you are eligible for all Covered Services . IMPORTANT NOTE : Until you have chosen a PCP, only Emergency care is covered. What a PCP does A PCP: (1) provides routine health care (This incl udes routine physical examinations.); (2) arranges for your care with other Tufts Health Plan Providers ; and (3) provides referrals for other health care services. See \" Inpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" and \" Outpatient mental health/substance abuse services\" later in this chapt er. Those sections have more information about obtaining referrals for these services. Your PCP, or a Covering Provider , is available 24 hours a day. Your PCP will coordinate your care by treating you or referring you to specialty services. Choosing a PCP You must choose a PCP from the list of PCPs in our Directory of Health Care Providers . You may already have a Provider who is listed as a PCP. In most instances, you may choose him or her as your PCP. Once you choose a PCP in our network , you must inform us of your choice. This is required for you to be eligible for all Covered Services. You may not have a PCP. Or, your PCP may not be listed in our Directory of Health Care Providers. In either case, call a Member Specialist for help in choosing a PCP. Contacting your new PCP If you choose a new Provider as your PCP, you should: Contact your new PCP as soon as you join. Identify yourself as a new Tufts Health Plan Member to him or her; Ask your previous Provider to transfer your medical records to your new PCP; and Make an appointment for a check-up or to meet your PCP. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-6 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. About Your Primary Care Provider, continued If you can't reach your PCP by phone right away Your PCP may not take your call right away. Alwa ys leave a message with the office staff or answering service. Wait a reasonable amount of time for someone to return you call. You may need medical services after hours. Contact your PCP or a Covering Provider . A Provider is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For Inpatient mental health or substance abuse services after hours, call 1-800-208-9565. Note : You may experience a medical emergency. If this happens, you do not have to contact your PCP or a Covering Provider ; instead, proceed to the nearest emergency medical facility for treatment (see \" Emergency and Urgent Care \" above for more information). Changing your PCP You may change your PCP. In certain instances, we may require you to do so. The new Provider will not be considered your PCP until: you choose a new PCP from our Directory of Health Care Providers ; you report your choice to a Member Specialist; and we approve the change in your PCP. Note : You may not change your PCP while an Inpatient or in a partial hospitalization program, except when approved by Tufts Health Plan in limited circumstances. Canceling appointments You may need to cancel an appointment with a Provider. If so, always give as much notice to the Provider as possible (at least 24 hours). Your Provider's office may charge for missed appointments that you did not cancel in advance. If this happens, we will not pay for the charges. Referrals for specialty services Every PCP is associated with a specific Provider Organization . If you need to see a specialist (including a pediatric specialist), your PCP will select the specialist and make the referral. Usually, your PCP will select and refer you to another Provider in the same Provider Organization . The PCP and the specialists already have a working relationship; as a result, this helps to provide quality and continuity of care. You may need specialty care not available within your PCP's Provider Organization (This is a rare event). If this happens, your PCP will choose a specialist in another Provider Organization and make the referral. When selecting a specialist for you, your PCP will consider: (1) any long-standing relationships that you have with any Tufts Health Plan Provider ; and (2) your clinical needs. (A long- standing relationship means that you have recent ly been seen or been treated repeatedly by that Tufts HP specialist.)

(This is a rare event.), Your PCP may refer you, with the prior approval of Tufts Health Plan or its designee, to a Provider not associated with Tufts Health Plan . Notes: You need a referral to a specialist from your PCP. You need that before receiving any Covered Services from that specialist. If you do not do this, you will be responsible for the cost of those services. Covered Services provided by non- Tufts Health Plan Providers are not paid for unless: (1) approved in advance by your PCP; and (2) approved by Tufts Health Plan or its designee . Referrals for mental health and substance abuse services: You do not need a referral from your PCP for care from a Tufts Health Plan Provider. However we recommend that you obtain prior authorization for that care.

Financial Arrangements between Tufts Health Plan and Tufts Health Plan Providers Methods of payment to Tufts Health Plan Providers Our goal in paying Providers is to encourage preventive care and active illness management. We strive to be sure that our financial reimbursem ent system: (1) encourages appropriate access to care; and (2) rewards Providers for providing high quality care to our Members . We use a variety of mutually agreed upon methods to compensate Tufts Health Plan Providers . The Tufts Health Plan Directory of Health Care Providers indicates the method of payment for each Provider . Regardless of the method of payment, we expect all participating Providers to use sound medical judgment when providing care and when determi ning whether a referral for specialty care is appropriate. This approach encourages the provision of Medically Necessary care and reduces the number of unnecessary medical tests and procedures that can be both harmful and costly to Members . We review the quality of care provided to our Members through our Quality of Health Care Program. Feel free to discuss with your Provider specific questions about how he or she is paid. Member Identification Card Introduction Tufts Health Plan gives each Member a member identification card (Member ID). Reporting errors When you receive your Member ID card, check it ca refully. If any information is wrong, call a Member Specialist. Identifying yourself as a Tufts Health Plan Member Your Member ID card is important; it identifies you as a Tufts Health Plan Member . Please: carry your Member ID card at all times; have your Member ID card with you for medical, hospital and other appointments; and show your Member ID card to any Provider before you receive health care services. When you receive services, tell the office staff that you are a Tufts Health Plan Member . IMPORTANT NOTE : Identify yourself as a Tufts Health Plan Member. If you do not, then: we may not pay for the services provided; and you would be responsible for the costs. Membership requirement You are eligible for benefits if you are a Member when you receive care. A Member ID card alone is not enough to get you benefits. If you receive care when you are not a Member , you are responsible for the cost. Membership identification number If you have any questions about your member ident ification number, call a Member Specialist. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 1-10 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Utilization Management Tufts Health Plan has a utilization management program. The purpose of the program is to control health care costs. It does this by evaluati ng whether health care services provided to Members are: (1) Medically Necessary; and (2) provided in the most appropriate and efficient manner. Under this program, we sometimes engage in prospec tive, concurrent, and retrospective review of health care services. We use prospective review to determine if proposed treatment is Medically Necessary. This review happens before that treatment begins. Prospec tive review is also referred to as \"Pre- Service Review\". We engage in concurrent review . We do this to: monitor the course of treatment as it occurs; and determine when that treatment is no longer Medically Necessary . We use retrospective review to evaluate care after it is provided. Sometimes, we use retrospective review to mo re accurately decide if a Member's health care services are appropriate Members . Retrospective review is also called \"Post-Service Review\". TIMEFRAMES FOR TUFTS HEALTH PLAN TO REVIEW YOUR REQUEST FOR COVERAGE Type of Review: Timeframe for Determinations:* Prospective (Pre-Service). Urgent : Within 72 hours of receiving all necessary information, and prior to the expected date of service. Non-urgent : Within 15 business days of receiving all necessary information and prior to the expected date of service. Concurrent Review. Prior to the end of the current certified period. Retrospective (Post-Service). Within 30 business days of receipt of a request for payment with all supporting documentation. *See Appendix B for determination procedures under the Department of Labor's (DOL) Regulations.

Under this program, we: encourage the use of the most appropria te and cost-effective treatment; and support the Member's treatment and progress.

Utilization Management, continued Individual case management (ICM) In certain circumstances, Tufts Health Plan may approve an individual case management (\"ICM\") plan for a Member with a Severe Illness or Injury. The IC M plan is designed to arrange for the most appropriate type, level, and setting of health care services and supplies for the Member . As a part of the ICM plan, we may approve coverage for alternative services and supplies that do not otherwise qualify as Covered Services for that Member . This will occur only if Tufts Health Plan determines, in its sole discretion, that a ll of the following conditions are satisfied: the Member's condition is expected to require medi cal treatment for an extended duration; the alternative services and supplies are Medically Necessary ; the alternative services and supplie s are provided directly to the Member with the condition; the alternative services and supplies are in plac e of more expensive treatment that qualifies as Covered Services ; the Member and Tufts Health Plan or its designee agree to the alte rnative treatment program; and the Member continues to show improvement in his or her condition. Tufts Health Plan or its designee will determine this periodically. We may approve an ICM plan. If this happens, we will also indicate the Covered Service that the ICM plan will replace. The benefit available for the ICM plan will be limited to the benefit that the Member would have received for the Covered Service . We will periodically monitor the appropriateness of the alternative services and supplies provided to the Member . We may decide, at any time, that these services and supplies fail to satisfy any of the conditions described above. In this event, we may modify or terminate coverage for the services or supplies provided pursuant to the ICM plan.

Covered Services , continued Prescription Drug Benefit - continued Tufts Health Plan Pharmacy Management Programs In order to provide safe, clinically appropr iate, cost-effective medications under this Prescription Drug Benefit, we have devel oped these Pharmacy Management Programs: Quantity Limitations Program: We limit the quantity of selected medications Members can receive in a given time period. We do this for cost, safety and/or clinical reasons. Prior Authorization Program: We restrict the coverage of certain drug produc ts. These are drugs with a narrow indication for usage, may have safety concerns and/or are extremely expensive. We require the prescribing Provider to obtain prior approval from us for such drugs. Step Therapy PA Program Step therapy is a type of prior authorization program. (This is usually automated.) This program uses a step-wise approach. It requi res the use of the most therapeutically appropriate and cost-effective agents first. After that, other medications may be covered. Members must try one or more medications on a lower step to treat a certain medical condition first. After that, a medication on a hi gher step may be covered for that condition. Non-Covered Drugs: Tufts Health Plan covers over 4,500 drugs. However, a small number of drugs (less than 1%) are not covered. This is because there are sa fe, effective and more affordable alternatives available. Drugs may not be covered for safety reasons, if they are new on the market, if they become available over-the-counter, or if a gener ic version of a drug becomes available. All of the alternative drug products ar e approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are widely used and accepted in the medical community to treat the same conditions as the medications that are not covered. For up-to-date information on these non-covered drugs and their suggested alternatives, please call Member Services, or see the web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com.

We then make a coverage determination based on the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee's recommendation. A new drug product will not be covered until this proce ss is completed. This is usually within 6 months of the drug pr oduct's availability. IMPORTANT NOTES : Your Provider may feel it is Medically Necessary for you to take medications that are [not on the formulary or] restricted under any of the \" Tufts Health Plan Pharmacy Management Programs\" above. In this ca se, he or she may submit a request for coverage. We will approve the request if it m eets our guidelines for coverage. For more information, call a Member Specialist. The Tufts Health Plan Web site has a list of covered drugs with their tiers. We may change a drug's tier during the year. For exam ple, a brand drug's patent may expire. In this case, we may change the drug's status by either (a) moving the brand drug from Tier- 2 to Tier-3 or (b) no longer covering the brand drug when a generic alternative becomes available.

Chapter 5 Continuation of Group Contract Coverage and Conversion Privilege Federal Continuation Coverage (COBRA) Rules for federal COBRA continuation Under the Federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), you may be eligible to continue coverage after Group coverage ends if you were enrolled in Tufts Health Plan through a Group which as 20 or more eligible employees and you experience a qualifying event (see list below) which would cause you to lose coverage under your Group . Note : Same-sex marriages legally entered into in Massachusetts are not recognized under federal law. Federal COBRA continuation pr ovisions therefore do not apply to same-sex Spouses . Check with your employer to see if CO BRA-like benefits are available to you. Qualifying Events A qualifying event is defined as: the Subscriber's death; termination of the Subscriber's employment for any reason other than gross misconduct; reduction in the Subscriber's work hours; the Subscriber's divorce or legal separation; the Subscriber's entitlement to Medicare; or the Subscriber's or Spouse's enrolled Dependent ceases to be a Dependent Child . If a Member experiences a qualifying event, he or she may be eligible to continue Group coverage as a Subscriber or an enrolled Dependent under federal COBRA law as described below. When federal COBRA coverage is effective A Member who is eligible for federal COBRA cont inuation coverage (a \"qualified beneficiary\") must be given an election period of 60 days to choose whether to elect federal COBRA continuation coverage. This period is measur ed from the later of the date the qualified beneficiary's coverage under the Group Contract ends (see the list of qualifying events described above); or the date the plan provides the qualified beneficiary with a COBRA election notice. A qualified beneficiary's federal COBRA continuation coverage becomes effective retroactive to the start of the election period, if he or she elects and pays for that coverage. Cost of Coverage In most cases, you are responsible for payment of 102% of the cost of coverage for the federal COBRA continuation coverage. (See \"Important Note\" in the \"Duration of Coverage\" table below for information about when you may be respons ible for payment of more than 102% of the cost of COBRA coverage.) For more information, contact your Group . Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 5-2 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Federal Continuation Coverage (COBRA), continued Duration of Coverage Qualified beneficiaries are eligible for federal CO BRA continuation coverage, in most cases, for a period of 18 or 36 months from the date of the qualifying event, depending on the type of qualifying event. Generally, COBRA coverage is available for a maximum of 18 months for qualifying events due to employment termination or reduction of work hours. Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of co verage, may permit a qualified beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of COBRA continuation coverage. For more information, see the \"Duration of Coverage\" table below. FEDERAL COBRA - DURATION OF COVERAGE Qualifying Event(s) Qualified Beneficiaries Maximum Period of Coverage Termination of Subscriber's employment for any reason other than gross misconduct. Reduction in the Subscriber's work hours. Subscriber, Spouse , and Dependent Children 18 months* Subscriber's divorce, legal separation, entitlement to Medicare, or death. Spouse and Dependent Children 36 months Subscriber's or Spouse's enrolled Dependent ceases to be a Dependent Child .Dependent Child 36 months *Important Note: If a qualified beneficiary is determined under the federal Social Security Act to have been disabled within the first 60 days of federal COBRA continuation coverage for these qualifying event s, then that qualified beneficiary and all of the qualified beneficiaries in his or her family may be able to extend COBRA coverage for up to an additional 11 months. You may be responsible for payment of up to 150% of the cost of COBRA coverage for th is additional period of up to 11 months. When coverage ends Federal COBRA continuation coverage will end at t he end of the maximum period of coverage. However, coverage may end earlier if: Coverage costs are not paid on a timely basis. Your Group ceases to maintain any group health plan. After the COBRA election, the qualified benefic iary obtains coverage with another employer group health plan that does not contain any ex clusion or pre-existing condition of such beneficiary. However, if other group health coverage is obtained prior to the COBRA election, COBRA coverage may not be disconti nued, even if the other coverage continues after the COBRA election. After the COBRA election, the qualified benefic iary becomes entitled to federal Medicare benefits. However, if Medicare is obtained pr ior to COBRA election, COBRA coverage may not be discontinued, even if the other cove rage continues after the COBRA election.

The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) The Uniformed Services Employment and Reempl oyment Rights Act (USERRA) protects the job rights of individuals who voluntarily or involunt arily leave employment positions to undertake military service or certain types of service in the National Disaster Medical System. USERRA also prohibits employers from discriminat ing against past and present members of the uniformed services, and applicants to the uniformed services. Under USERRA: You have the right to be reemployed in your ci vilian job if you leave that job to perform service in the uniformed service, and (1) y ou ensure that your employer receives advance written or verbal notice of your serv ice; (2) you have five years or less of cumulative service in the uniformed service while with that particular employer' (3) you return to work or apply for reemployment in a timely manner after conclusion of service; and (4) you have not been separated from servic e with a disqualifying discharge or under other than honorable conditions. If you are e ligible to be reemployed, you must be restored to the job and benefits you would have attained if you have not been absent due to military service or, in some cases, a comparable job. If you are a past or present member of the uniformed services, have applied for membership in the uniformed services, or are obligated to serve in the uniformed services, then an employer may not deny you initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benef it of employment because of this status. In addition, an employer may not retaliate agai nst anyone assisting in the enforcement of USERRA rights, including testifying or making a statement in connection with a proceeding under USERRA, even if that person has no service connection. If you leave your job to perform military servic e, you have the right to elect to continue your existing employer-based health plan coverage for you and your Dependents for up to 24 months while in the military. If you don't elect to continue coverage during your military service, you have the right to be reinstated in your employer's health pl an when you are reemployed, generally without any waiting periods or exclusions (for exam ple, pre-existing conditi on exclusions) except for service-connected illnesses or injuries. Service members may be required to pay up to 102% of the premium for the health plan coverage. If coverage is for less than 31 days, the service member is only required to pay the employee share, if any, for such coverage. USERRA coverage runs concurrently with COBRA and other state continuation coverage. The U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans' Empl oyment and Training Service (VETS) is authorized to investigate and resolve complaints of USERRA violations. For assistance in filing a complaint, or for any other information on USERRA, contact VETS at 1-866-4-USA-DOL, or visit its WEB site at www.dol.gove/vets .

This Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") provision applies to This Plan when an employee or the employee's covered dependent has health care coverage under more than one Plan. \"Plan\" and \"This Plan\" are defined below. B. If this COB provision applies, the order of benefit determination rules should be looked at first. Those rules determine whether the benefit s of \"This Plan\" are determined before or after those of another plan. The benefits of \"This Plan\": (1) shall not be reduced when, under the order of benefit determination rules, \"This Plan\" determines its benefits bef ore another plan; but (2) may be reduced when, under the order of benefits determination rules, another plan determines its benefits first. The above reduction is described in the \"Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" \" section below. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 7-5 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Definitions A. \"Plan\" is any of the following which provides benefits or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (1) Group insurance or group-type coverage whet her insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, group practice or individual practi ce coverage. It also includes coverage other than school accident-type coverage. (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or cove rage required to be provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (T itle XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs, of the Un ited States Social Security Act, as amended from time to time). Each contract or other arrangement for coverage under (1) or (2) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate plan. B. \"This Plan\" is the part of the Group Contract that provides benefits for health care expenses. C. \"Primary Plan/Secondary Plan:\" The order of benefit determination rules state whether \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan as to another plan covering the person. When \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan, its benefits ar e determined before those of the other plan and without considering the other plan's benefits. When \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan, its benefits are determined after those of the other plan and may be reduced because of the other plan's benefits. When there are more t han two plans covering the person, \"This Plan\" may be a Primary Plan as to one or more other plans, and may be a Secondary Plan as to a different plan or plans. D. \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessary, r easonable and customary item of expense for health care; when the item of expense is cove red at least in part by one or more plans covering the person for whom the claim is m ade. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi -private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense under the above definition unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is medically necessary either in terms of generally accepted medical practice, or as specifically defined in the plan. When a plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service r endered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. E. \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar y ear. However, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no cover age under \"This Plan\", or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 7-6 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Order of Benefit Determination Rules A. General. When there is a basis for a clai m under \"This Plan\" and another plan, \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan which has its benefits determi ned after those of the other plan, unless: (1) The other plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those of \"This Plan\"; and (2) Both those rules and \"This Plan\"'s rules, in Subsection B below, require that \"This Plan\"'s benefits be determined before t hose of the other plan. B. Rules. \"This Plan\" determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules which applies: (1) Non-Dependent/Dependent. The benefits of the plan which covers the person as an employee, member or subscriber (that is, other than as a dependent) are determined before those of the plan which covers the person as a dependent. (2) Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divor ced. Except as stated in Paragraph B(3) below, when \"This Plan\" and another plan cover the same child as a dependent of different person, called \"parents:\" (a) The benefits of the plan of the parent w hose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before those of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; but (b) If both parents have the same birthday, t he benefits of the plan which covered the parents longer are determined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. However, if the other plan does not have the rule described in (a) immediately above, but instead has the rule based upon the gender of the patient, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other plan will determine the order of benefits. (3) Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced. If two or more plans cover a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parent s, benefits for the child are determined in this order: (a) First, the plan of the parent with custody of the child; (b) Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and (c) Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a cour t decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. The plan of the other parent shall be the Secondary Plan. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any Claim Determination Period or Plan year during which any benefits are actually paid or provided before the entity has that actual knowledge. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 7-7 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Order of Benefit Determination Rules , continued (4) Joint Custody. If the specific terms of a court decree state that the parents shall share joint custody, without stating that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering t he child shall follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined above in Pa ragraph B(2) of this section. (5) Active/Inactive Employee. The benefits of a plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (o r as that employee's dependent) are determined before those of a plan which covers that pers on as a laid off or retired employee (or as that employee's dependent). If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this Rule (5) is ignored. (6) Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the pl an which covered an employee, member or subscriber longer are determined before thos e of the Plan which covered that person for the shorter term. Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" A. When This Section Applies. This section applies when, in accordanc e with the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section above, \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan as to one or more other plans. In that event the benefit s of \"This Plan\" may be reduced under this section. Such other plan or plans are referred to as \"the other plans\" in B immediately below. B. Reduction in \"This Plan\"'s Benefits. T he benefits of \"This Plan\" will be reduced when the sum of: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under \"This Plan\" in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that would be payable for the A llowable Expenses under the other plans, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this CO B provision, whether or not claim is made, exceeds those Allowable Ex penses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the benefits of \"This Plan\" will be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under the other plans do not total more than those Allowable Expenses. When the benefits of \"This Plan\" are reduced as described above, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any app licable benefit limit of \"This Plan\".

Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules. Tufts Health Plan has the right to decide which facts it needs. It may get needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person. Tufts Health Plan need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under \"This Plan\" must give Tufts Health Plan any facts it needs to pay the claim. Facility of Payment A payment made under another plan may incl ude an amount which should have been paid under \"This Plan\". If it does, Tufts Health Plan may pay that amount to the organization which made that payment. That amount will then be tr eated as though it were a benefit paid under \"This Plan\". Tufts Health Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" means reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means reasonable cash va lue of the benefits provided in the form of services. Right of Recovery If the amount of the payments made by Tufts Health Plan is more than it should have paid under this COB provision, it may recover the excess from one or more of: A. The persons it has paid or for whom it has paid; B. Insurance companies; or C. Other organizations. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services.

Appendix B - ERISA Information ERISA RIGHTS If your plan is an ERISA plan, you are entitl ed to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended. Most plans are ERISA plans, but not all. Please contact your plan administrator to determine if your plan is an ERISA plan. ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to receive information about their plan and benefits, continue group health plan coverage, and prudent actions by plan fiduciaries. Receiving Information About Your Plan and Benefits ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to: Examine, without charge, at the plan administrator's office and at other specified locations all documents governing the plan, including insu rance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and a copy of the latest annual r eport (Form 5500 Series) filed by the plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Discl osure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration. Obtain, upon written request to the plan adminis trator, copies of documents governing the operation of the plan, including insurance c ontracts and collective bargaining agreements, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and updated summary plan description. The plan administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies. Receive a summary of the plan's annual financia l report. The plan administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary annual report. Continuing Group Health Plan Coverage ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to: Continue health care coverage for yoursel f, spouse or dependents if there is a loss of coverage under the plan as a result of a qualifying event. You or your dependents may have to pay for such coverage. Review your summary plan description and the documents governing the plan on the rules governing your continuation coverage right s under the Federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Reduction or elimination of exclusionary peri ods of coverage for preexisting conditions under a group health plan, if you have creditabl e coverage from another plan. You should be provided a certificate of cr editable coverage, free of char ge, from your group health plan or health insurance issuer when you lose coverage under the plan, when you become entitled to elect COBRA continuation cover age, when your COBRA continuation coverage ceases, if you request it before losing coverage, or if you request it up to 24 months after losing coverage. Without evidence of credi table coverage, you may be subject to a preexisting condition exclusion for 12 months ( 18 months for late enrollees) after your enrollment date in your coverage. Note : This plan does not include a preexisting condition exclusion. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. B-2 To contact Member Se rvices, call 1-800-682-8059, or see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. ERISA RIGHTS, continued Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for plan partici pants ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the pl an. The people who operate your plan, called ``fiduciaries'' of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a plan benefit or exerci sing your rights under ERISA. Enforcing Your Rights If your claim for a plan benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a feder al court. In such a case, the court may require the plan administrator to provide the material s and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not s ent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits whic h is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qua lified status of a domestic rela tions order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in federal cour t. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these co sts and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. Assistance with Your Questions If you have any questions about your plan, you should contact the plan administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the plan administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Admini stration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. D epartment of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the public ations hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

PROCESSING OF CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS The Department of Labor's (DOL) Employee Benef its Security Administration has published benefit determination procedure regulations for employee benefit plans governed under ERISA. The regulations set forth requirements with respect to the processing of claims for plan benefits, including urgent care claims, pre-se rvice claims, post-service claims and review of claims denials. Who can submit a claim? The DOL Regulations apply to claims submitted by ERISA participants or their beneficiaries. In accordance with the regulations, Tufts H ealth Plan permits an authorized representative (referred to here as the \"authorized claimant\") to act on your behalf in submitting a claim or obtaining a review of a claim decision. An authorized claimant can be any individual (including, for example, a family member, an attorney, etc.) whom you designate to act on your behalf with respect to a claim for benefits. How do I designate an Authorized Claimant? An authorized claimant can be designated at any point in the claims process - at the pre- service, post service or appeal level. Please contact a Tufts Health Plan Member Specialist at 1-800-682-8059 for the specifics on how to appoint an authorized claimant. Types of claims There are several different types of claims that you may submit for review. Tufts Health Plan's procedures for reviewing claims depends upon t he type of claim submitted (urgent care claims, pre-service claims, post-service claims, and concurrent care claims). Urgent care claims: An \"urgent care claim\" is a claim for medical care or treatment where the application of the claims review procedure for non-urgent claims: (1) could seriously jeopardize your life, health or ability to regai n maximum function, or (2) based upon your Provider's determination, would subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment being r equested. For urgent care claims, we will respond to you within 72 hours after receipt of the claim. If we determine that additional information is needed to review your claim, we will notify you within 24 hours after the receipt of the claim and provide you with a description of the additional information needed to evaluate your claim. You have 48 hour after that time to provide the requested information. We will evaluate your claim within 48 hours after the earlie r of our receipt of the requested information, or the end of the extension period given to you to provide the requested information. Concurrent care decisions: A \"concurrent care decision\" is a determination relating to the continuation/reduction of an ongoing course of treatment. If we have already approved an ongoing course of treatment for you and consi ders reducing or terminating the treatment, we will notify you sufficiently in advance of the reduc tion or termination of treatment to allow you to appeal the decision and obtain a determinati on before the treatment is reduced or terminated. If you request to extend an ongoing course of treatment that involves urgent care, we will respond to you within 24 hours after receipt of the request (provided that you make the request at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the ongoing course of treatment). If you reach the end of a pre-approved c ourse of treatment before r equesting additional services, the \"pre-service\" or \"post-service\" time limits will apply.

PROCESSING OF CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS, continued Types of claims, continued Pre-Service Claim: A \"pre-service claim\" is a claim that requires approval of the benefit in advance of obtaining the care. For pre-service claims, we will respond to you within 72 hours for an urgent request and within 15 days for a non-urgent request after receipt of the claim. If we determine that an extension is necessary for a non-urgent request due to matters beyond our control, we will notify you within 15 days in forming you of the circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which we expect to r ender a decision (up to an additional 15 days). If you make a pre-service claim, but do not submit enough information for us to make a determination, we will notify you within 15 days and describe the information that you need to provide to us. You will have no less than 45 days from the date you receive the notice to provide the requested information.

For post-service claims, we will respond to you within 30 days and describe the information that you need to provide to us. You will have no less than 45 days from the date you receive the notic e to provide the requested information. If your request for coverage is denied, you have t he right to file an appeal.

STATEMENT OF RIGHTS UNDER THE NEWBORNS' AND MOTHERS' HEALTH PROTECTION ACT Under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage generally may not restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a delivery by cesarean section. However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if t he attending provider (e.g., your physician, nurse midwife, or physician assistant), after consulta tion with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, plans or issuers may not set the level of benefits or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48-hour (or 96-hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a physician or other health care provider obtain authorization for prescribi ng a length of stay or up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, you may be required to obtain precertification. For information on precerti fication, contact your plan administrator.

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT OF 1993 Note : The Family and Medical Leave Act only applies to groups with 50 or more employees. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (F MLA), if an employee meets the eligibility requirements, that employee is legally allowed to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following reasons: for the birth and care of the newborn child of the employee; for placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; to care for an immediate family member (s pouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or to take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition. The FMLA was amended to add two new leave right s related to military service, effective January 16, 2009: Qualifying Exigency Leave: Eligible employees are entitlted to up to 12 weeks of leave because of \"any qualifying exigency\" due to the fact that the spouse, son, daugheter, or parent of the employee is on active duty, or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status, in support of a contingency operation. Military Caregiver Leave: An eligible employ ee who is the spouse, son, daughter parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty is entit led to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12- month period to care for the servicemember. T he employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks for all types of FMLA leave in the single 12-month period. In order to be eligible, the employee must have wo rked for his or her employer for a total of 12 months and worked at least 1,250 hour s over the previous 12 months. A covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage for an employee on FMLA leave whenever such insurance was pr ovided before the leave was taken and on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. If applicable, arrangements will need to be made for employees to pay their share of heal th insurance premiums while on leave. In some instances, the employer may recover premiu ms it paid to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from FMLA leave. An employee should contact his or her employer for details about FMLA and to make payment arrangements, if applicable. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A.

The Rhode Island calendar yea r 2012 projection, using year -to-date claims and premium experience , is running more favorabl y than what was expected in pricing, after a djusting for the impact of the high cost claims . Small group claims are 3.8% below the expected level, and large group claims are 2.3% below. The current OHIC approved 2013 THP base rates include lower administrative expenses than we believe to be adequate . The lower administrative expenses account for 0.6% of the small group base rate and 1.4% of the large group base ra te. Tufts Health Plan wishes to balance the need for adequate premium with the need for competitive rates in order to gain more membership and remain an active player in the Rhode Island market. With all the above consideration s, THP is requesting a red uction in base rates of 3.2% for small group and 1.0% for large group, effective as soon as practically possible . The Affordable Care Act includes a mandated Women's Preventive Health Services benefit that was effective August 1, 2012. The mandate require s insurance carriers to cover contraceptive drugs and procedures and breastfeeding support services in full with no member cost sharing. THP has analyzed the incremental cost of the mandated benefits and determined that a benefit factor increase of 0.6% wi ll need to be applied to all plans. THP is requesting permission to include this benefit factor increase for both manual and experience rated plans. I certify that the actuarial analys es cited above were developed using sound actuarial assumptions and met hodologies. _________________________ Jen Stevenson , F.S.A., M.A.A.A.

We strive to be sure that our financ ial reimbursement syst em: (1) encourages appropriate access to care; and (2) rewards Providers for providing high quality care to our Members . We use a variety of mutua lly agreed upon methods to compensate Network Providers [with whom we contract]. The Directory of Health Care Providers indicates the method of payment for each Provider . Regardless of the method of paym ent, we expect all participating Providers to use sound medical judgment when providing care and when determining whether a re ferral for specialty care is appropriate. This approa ch encourages the provision of Medically Necessary care and reduces the number of unnecessary medical te sts and procedures that can be both harmful and costly to Members . Feel free to discuss specific questions about how he or she is paid with your Provider . Member Identification Card Introduction CareLink gives each Member a member identi fication card (Member ID card). Reporting errors When you receive your Member ID card, check it carefully. If any information is wrong, call Member Services. Identifying yourself as a CareLink Member Your Member ID card is impor tant; it identifies you as a CareLink Member . Please: (1) carry your Member ID card at all time s; (2) have your Member ID card with you for medical, hospital and other appointments and; (3) show your card to any Provider before you receive health care services. When you receive serv ices, tell the staff that you are a CareLink Member . Membership requirement You are eligible for benefits if you are a Member when you receive care. A Member ID card alone is not enough to get you benefits. If you receive care when you are not a Member , you are responsible for the cost. Membership identification number If you have any questions about your memb er identification number, call a CareLink Member Specialist. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A.

It does this by evaluating whether health care services provided to Members are: (1) Medically Necessary; and (2) provided in the most appropria te and efficient manner. [This program sometimes includes prospective, concurrent, and retrospective review of health care services.] [We use prospective review to determine if proposed treatment is Medically Necessary . This review happens before that treat ment begins. It is also ca lled \"Pre-Service Review\". We use concurrent review to: (1) monitor the course of tr eatment as it occurs; and (2) to determine when that tr eatment is no longer Medically Necessary . We use retrospective review to evaluate care after it is provided.Sometimes, we use retrospective review to more accurately decide if a Member's health care services are appropriate. It is also calle d \"Post-Service Review\". ] [TIMEFRAMES FOR TUFTS HEALTH PLAN TO REVIEW YOUR COVERAGE REQUEST Type of Review: Timeframe for Determinations:[*] Prospective (Pre-Service) Review.

USERRA also prohibits employers from discriminating against past and present members of the uniformed services, and applicants to the uniformed services. Under USERRA: You have the right to be reemployed in your ci vilian job if you leave that job to perform service in the uniformed service, and (1) you ens ure that your employer receives advance written or verbal notice of your service; (2 ) you have five years or less of cumulative service in the uniformed service while with that particular employer; (3) you return to work or apply for reemployment in a timely manner a fter conclusion of service; and (4) you have not been separated from service with a di squalifying discharge or under other than honorable conditions. If you are eligible to be reemployed, you must be restored to the job and benefits you would have attained if you had not been absent due to military service, or, in some cases, a comparable job. If you are a past or present member of the uniformed service, have applied for membership in the uniformed service, or are ob ligated to service in the uniformed service, then an employer may not deny you initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment because of this status. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against any assi sting in the enforcement of USERRA rights, including testifying or maki ng a statement in connection wit h a proceeding under USERRA, even if that person has no service connection. If you leave your job to perform military servic e, you have the right to elect to continue your existing employer-based health plan coverage for you and your Dependents for up to 24 months while in the military. If you don't elect to continue coverage during your military service, you have the right to be reinstated in your employer's health plan when you are reem ployed, generally without any waiting periods or exclusions (for example, pre-existing c ondition exclusions) except for service-connected illnesses or injuries. Service members may be required to pay up to 102% of the premium for the health plan coverage. If coverage is for less than 31 days, the service member is only required to pay the employee share, if any, for such coverage. USERRA coverage runs concurrently with CO BRA and other state continuation coverage. The U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans' Employment and Traini ng Service is authorized to investigate and resolve compla ints of USERRA violations.

When \"This Plan\" is a Se condary Plan, its benefits are determined after those of the other plan and may be reduced because of the other plan's benefits.

If two or more plans cover a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for t he child are determined in this order: (a) First, the plan of the par ent with custody of the child; (b) Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and (c) Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a court dec ree state that one of th e parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of t hat parent has actual k nowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. The plan of the othe r parent shall be the Secondary Plan. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any Cla im Determination Period or Plan year during which any benefits are actually paid or provided before the ent ity has that actual knowledge. (4) Joint Custody. If the specific terms of a court decree state t hat the parents shall share joint custody, without stating t hat one of the parents is responsib le for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering the child shall follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined above in Paragraph B(2) of this section. (5) Active/Inactive Employee. The benefits of a plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as that employee's dependent ) are determined before those of a plan which covers t hat person as a laid off or re tired employee (or as that employee's dependent). If the othe r plan does not have this rule , and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benef its, this Rule (5) is ignored. (6) Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the plan which covered an employee, me mber or subscriber longer are determined before those of the Plan which covered that person for the shorter term. Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" A. When This Section Applies. This section applies when, in accordan ce with the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section above, \"This Pl an\" is a Secondary Plan as to one or more other plans. In that event the benefits of \"This Plan\" may be r educed under this section. Such other plan or plans are referred to as \"the other plans\" in B immediately below. B. Reduction in \"This Plan\"'s Benefits. The benef its of \"This Plan\" will be reduced when the sum of: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under \"This Plan\" in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under the other plans, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this CO B provision, whether or not claim is made, exceeds those Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the benefits of \"This Plan\" will be r educed so that they and the benefits payable under the other plans do not total more than t hose Allowable Expenses. When the benefits of \"This Plan\" are reduced as described above , each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of \"This Plan\".

Most plans are ERISA plans, but not all. cont act your plan administrator to det ermine if your plan is an ERISA plan. ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to receive information about their plan and benefits, continue group health plan coverage, and prudent actions by plan fiduciaries. Receiving Information About Your Plan and Benefits ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to: Examine, without charge, at t he plan administrator's office and at other specified locations, all documents governing the plan, including in surance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and a copy of the la test annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA). Obtain, upon written request to the plan admini strator, copies of documents governing the operation of the plan, includi ng insurance contracts and co llective bargaining agreements, and copies of the latest annual report (F orm 5500 Series) and updated summary plan description.

You or your dependents may have to pay for such coverage. Review your summary plan descrip tion and the documents governing the plan on the rules governing y our continuation coverage rights under the Federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA).

Without evidence of creditable cove rage, you may be subject to a preexisting condition exclusion for 12 months (18 months for late enrollees) after your enrollment date in your coverage. Note : This plan [does not include] [incl udes] a preexisting condition exclusion. B-2 ERISA Rights, continued Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for plan particip ants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the pl an. The people who operate your plan, called \"fiduciaries'' of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against y ou in any way to prevent you from obtaining a plan benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. Enforcing Your Rights If your claim for a plan benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps yo u can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a feder al court. In such a case , the court may require the plan administrator to prov ide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not s ent because of reasons be yond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits whic h is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court. In addition, if y ou disagree with the plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qua lified status of a domestic rela tions order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in federal court. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserti ng your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and f ees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. Assistance with Your Questions If you have any questions about your plan, you s hould contact the plan adm inistrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining document s from the plan administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Se curity Administration, U.S. Depa rtment of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technica l Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitu tion Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hot line of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

If you make a pre-service claim, but do not submit enough information for us to make a determination, we will notify you within 15 da ys and describe the information that you need to provide to us. You will have no less than 45 da ys from the date you receive the notice to provide the requested information.

However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending provider (e.g., your physician, nurse midwife, or physician a ssistant), after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, plans or issuers may not set the level of benefit s or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of t he 48-hour (or 96-hour) stay is treat ed in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a physician or other health care provider obtain authorizatio n for prescribing a length of stay or up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, you may be required to obtain precertification. For information on precer tification, contact your plan administrator. B-5 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT OF 1993 Note : The Family and Medical Leave Act only applies to groups with 50 or more employees. Under the Family and Medical Le ave Act of 1993 (FMLA), if an em ployee meets the eligibility requirements, that employee is legally allowed to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for one or mo re of the following reasons: for the birth and care of the newborn child of the employee; for placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; to care for an immediate fam ily member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or to take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition. The FMLA was amended to add two new leave right related to military service, effective January 16, 2009: Qualifying Exigency Leave: Eligible employ ees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of leave because of \"any qualifying exigen cy\" due to the fact tthat the spouse, son, daughter, ro parent of the employee is on active duty, or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status, in support of a contingency operation. Military Caregiver Leave: An eligible empl oyee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered servicemember who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active dut y is entitled to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12-month period to care for the servic emember. The employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks for all types of FM LA leave in the single 12-month period. In order to be eligible, the empl oyee must have worked for his or her employer for a total of 12 months and worked at least 1,250 hour s over the previous 12 months. A covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage for an employee on FMLA leave whenever such insurance was pr ovided before the leave was taken and on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. If applicable, arrangements will need to be made for employees to pay their share of heal th insurance premiums while on leave. In some instances, the employer may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from FMLA leave. An employee should contact his or her employer for details about FMLA and to make payment arrangements, if applicable.

Financial Arrangements between Tufts Health Plan and Network Providers Methods of payment to Network Providers Our goal in paying Providers is to encourage preventive care and active illness management. We strive to be sure that our financial reim bursement system: (1 ) encourages appropriate access to care; and (2) rewards Providers for providing high quality care to our Members . We use a variety of mutually agreed upon methods to compensate Network Providers [with whom we contract]. The Directory of Health Care Providers indicates the method of payment for each Provider . Regardless of the method of paym ent, we expect all participating Providers to use sound medical judgment when providing care and when determining whether a referral for specialty care is appropriate. This approach encourages the provision of Medically Necessary care and reduces the number of unnecessary medical tests and procedur es that can be both harmful and costly to Members . Feel free to discuss specific questions about how he or she is paid with your Provider . Member Identification Card Introduction We give each Member a member identification card (Member ID card). Reporting errors When you receive your Member ID card, check it carefully. If any information is wrong, call Member Services. Identifying yourself as a Tufts Health Plan Member Your Member ID card is impor tant; it identifies you as a Tufts Health Plan Member . Please: (1) carry your Member ID card at all times; (2) have your Member ID card with you for medical, hospital and other appoint ments; and (3) show your card to any Provider before you receive health care services. When you receive services, tell the st aff that you are a Tufts Health Plan Member . Membership requirement You are eligible for benefits if you are a Member when you receive care. A Member ID card alone is not enough to get you benefits. If you receive care when you are not a Member , you are responsible for the cost. Membership identification number If you have any questions about your member ident ification number, call a Member Specialist. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A.

Or see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. 1-6Utilization Management Utilization management The purpose of the utilization m anagement program is to control health care costs. It does this by evaluating whether health care services provided to Members are: (1) Medically Necessary ; and (2) provided in the most appropria te and efficient manner. [This program sometimes includes prospective, concurrent , and retrospective review of health care services.] [We use prospective review to determine if proposed treatment is Medically Necessary . This review happens before that treat ment begins. It is also ca lled \"Pre-Service Review\". We use concurrent review to: (1) monitor the course of treatment as it occurs; and (2) to determine when that tr eatment is no longer Medically Necessary . We use retrospective review to evaluate care after it is provided. Sometimes, we use retrospective review to more accurately decide if a Member's health care services are appropriate. It is also call ed \"Post-Service Review\". ] [TIMEFRAMES FOR TUFTS HEALTH PLAN TO REVIEW YOUR COVERAGE REQUEST Type of Review: Timeframe for Determinations:[*] Prospective (Pre-Service) Review. Urgen t: [Within 72 hours of receipt of the request.] [Within 72 hour s of receiving all necessary information.] Non-urgent: [Within 15 business days of receipt of the request.] [Within 15 business days of receiving all necessary information.] Concurrent Review.

Under this program, we: (1) encourage the use of the most appropriate and cost-effe ctive treatment; and (2) support the Member's treatment and progress. We may contact the Member and his or her Network Provider . We may do this to discuss a treatment plan and establish short and long term goals. A Specialty Case Manager may suggest alternative treatment settings available to the Member . We may periodically review the Member's treatment plan. We will contact the Member and the Member's Network Provider if we identify alternatives to the Member's current treatment plan are identified that: qualify as Covered Services ; are cost effective; and are appropriate for the Member . A Severe Illness or Injury includes, but is not limited to, the following: high-risk pregnancy and newborn Children ; serious heart or lung disease; cancer; certain neurological diseases; AIDS or other immune system diseases; severe traumatic injury. certain mental health condition s, including substance abuse; [Individual case management (ICM)] [In certain circumstances, we may approve an i ndividual case management (\"ICM\") plan for a Member with a Severe Illness or Injury. The ICM plan is designed to arrange for the most appropriate type, level, and setting of health care services and supplies for the Member . As a part of the ICM plan, we may approve cove rage for alternative services and supplies that do not otherwise qualify as Covered Services for that Member . This will occur only if Tufts Health Plan determines, in its sole discretion, that a ll of the following condi tions are satisfied: the Member's condition is expected to require medi cal treatment for an extended duration; the alternative services and supplies are Medically Necessary ; the alternative services and supplies are provided directly to the Member with the condition; the alternative services and supplies are in plac e of more expensive treatment that qualifies as Covered Services ; the Member and Tufts Health Plan or its designee agree to the al ternative treatment program; and the Member continues to show improvement in his or her condition. Tufts Health Plan or its designee will determine this periodically. We may approve an ICM plan. If th is happens, we will also indicate the Covered Service that the ICM plan will replace. The benefit available for the ICM plan will be limited to the benefit that the Member would have received for the Covered Service . Tufts Health Plan will periodically monitor the appropriateness of the alternative services and supplies provided to the Member . We may decide, at any ti me, that these services and supplies fail to satisfy any of the conditions described above. In this event, we may modify or terminate coverage for the services or s upplies provided pursuant to the ICM plan.] Italicized words are defined in Appendix A.

A review team will: (1) verify eligibility at that time; and (2) assign an anticipated length-of-stay guideline if the admission is approved. The review team may also review your proposed medical care, verify Medical Necessity or recommend an alternative treatment setting. Preregistration does not guarantee payment. We are not obli gated to pay claims that have been Preregistered for: (1) pers ons who are not Members on the date of service; (2) who are not eligible for coverage ; (3) who receiv e care that is determined not to be Medically Necessary ; or (4) if the claim is not for a Covered Service . If you get care at the In-Network Level of Benefits, your Network Provider is responsible for Preregistering your Inpatient admission or transfer. You do not need to Preregister the admission or transfer. Extension of Hospitalization All Inpatient hospitalizations are monitored. It may be Medically Necessary for you to stay in the hospital longer than the originally approved length-of-stay. If this happens, Tufts Health Plan staff will request additional clinical information from your attending Provider or hospital so that we can approve a longer hospital stay, if Medically Necessary . Additional Medically Necessary hospital days may be authorized. Note : After consulting your Provider, we may determine that Inpatient hospitalization is no longer Medically Necessary . If this happens, we will notify y ou that any additional hospital days will not be covered. You will be responsible for paying for all hospital and Provider charges if you choose to stay in the hospital beyond the discharge date. ] Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 2-1 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059.

This Coordination of Benefit s (\"COB\") provision applies to Th is Plan when an employee or the employee's covered dependent has health care co verage under more than one Plan. \"Plan\" and \"This Plan\" are defined below. B. If this COB provision applies, the order of benefit det ermination rules should be looked at first. Those rules determine whether the benefits of \"Thi s Plan\" are determined be fore or after those of another plan. The benefits of \"This Plan\": (1) shall not be reduced when, under the order of benefit dete rmination rules, \"This Plan\" determines its benefits bef ore another plan; but (2) may be reduced when, under the order of benefits determinati onrules, another plan determines its benefits first. T he above reduction is described in the \"Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" \" section below. Italicized words are defi ned in this Appendix A. 7-5 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Definitions A. \"Plan\" is any of the following which provides benef its or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (1) Group insurance or group-type coverage whet her insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, group practice or individual practice coverage. It also in cludes coverage other than school accident-type coverage. (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or coverage required to be provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (T itle XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs, of the United States Social Securi ty Act, as amended from time to time). Each contract or ot her arrangement for coverage under (1 ) or (2) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate plan. B. \"This Plan\" is the part of the Group Contract that provides benefits for health care expenses. C. \"Primary Plan/Secondary Plan: \" The order of benefit determinat ion rules state whether \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan as to another plan covering the person. When \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan, its benef its are determined before those of the other plan and without considering the other plan's benef its. When \"This Plan\" is a Se condary Plan, its benefits are determined after those of the other plan and may be reduced bec ause of the other plan's benefits. When there ar e more than two plans covering t he person, \"This Plan\" may be a Primary Plan as to one or more other plans, and may be a Secondary Plan as to a different plan or plans. D. \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessary, r easonable and customary it em of expense for health care; when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more plans covering the person for whom the claim is made. The di fference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi-private hospital r oom is not considered an Allowable Expense under the above definition unless t he patient's stay in a privat e hospital room is medically necessary either in terms of generally accepted m edical practice, or as sp ecifically defined in the plan. When a plan provides benefits in the form of services , the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. E. \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar y ear. However, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no coverage under \"This Plan\", or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect.

Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Order of Benefit Determination Rules A. General. When there is a basis for a claim under \"This Plan\" and another plan, \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan which has its benefits determined after those of the other plan, unless: (1) The other plan has rules coordinating it s benefits with those of \"This Plan\"; and (2) Both those rules and \"This Plan's\"' rules, in Subsection B below, require that \"This Plan's\" benefits be determined before th ose of the other plan. B. Rules. \"This Plan\" determines it s order of benefits using the firs t of the following rules which applies: (1) Non-Dependent/Dependent. The benefits of the plan which covers the person as an employee, member or subscr iber (that is, other than as a dependent) are determined before those of the plan which co vers the person as a dependent. (2) Dependent Child/Parents Not Separ ated or Divorced. Except as stated in Paragraph B(3) below, when \"This Plan\" and another plan cover t he same child as a dependent of different person, called \"parents:\" (a) The benefits of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before those of the pl an of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; but (b) If both parents have the same birthday, t he benefits of the plan which covered the parents longer are determined be fore those of the plan whic h covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. However, if the other plan does not have the rule described in (a) immediately above, but instead has the rule based upon the gender of the patient, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other plan will determine the order of benefits. (3) Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced. If two or more plans cover a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for t he child are determined in this order: (a) First, the plan of the par ent with custody of the child; (b) Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and (c) Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a court dec ree state that one of th e parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of t hat parent has actual k nowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. The plan of the othe r parent shall be the Secondary Plan. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any Cla im Determination Period or Plan year during which any benefits are actually paid or provided before the ent ity has that actual knowledge.

Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Order of Benefit Determination Rules, continued (4) Joint Custody. If the specific terms of a c ourt decree state that the parents shall share joint custody, without stating t hat one of the parents is responsib le for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering the child shall follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined above in Paragraph B(2) of this section. (5) Active/Inactive Employee. The benefits of a plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as that employee's dependent ) are determined before those of a plan which covers t hat person as a laid off or re tired employee (or as that employee's dependent). If the othe r plan does not have this rule , and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benef its, this Rule (5) is ignored. (6) Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the plan which covered an employee, me mber or subscriber longer are determined before those of the Plan which covered that person for the shorter term. Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" A. When This Section Applies. This section applies when, in accordan ce with the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section above, \"This Pl an\" is a Secondary Plan as to one or more other plans. In that event the benefits of \"This Plan\" may be r educed under this section. Such other plan or plans are referred to as \"the other plans\" in B immediately below. B. Reduction in \"This Plan\"'s Benefits. The benef its of \"This Plan\" will be reduced when the sum of: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under \"This Plan\" in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under the other plans, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this CO B provision, whether or not claim is made, exceeds those Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the benefits of \"This Plan\" will be r educed so that they and the benefits payable under the other plans do not total more than t hose Allowable Expenses. When the benefits of \"This Plan\" are reduced as described above , each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of \"This Plan\". Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules. Tufts Health Plan has the right to decide which facts it needs. It may get needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person. Tufts Health Plan need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under \"This Plan\" must give Tufts Health Plan any facts it needs to pay the claim. Facility of Payment A payment made under another plan may incl ude an amount which should have been paid under \"This Plan\". If it does, Tufts Health Plan may pay that amount to the organization which made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a be nefit paid under \"This Plan\". Tufts Health Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" means reasonable cash value of the benefit s provided in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services.

ERISA provides that all plan par ticipants shall be entitled to receive information about their plan and benefits, continue group health plan coverage, and prudent actions by plan fiduciaries. Receiving Information About Your Plan and Benefits ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to: Examine, without charge, at t he plan administrator's office and at other specified locations, all documents governing the plan, including in surance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and a copy of the la test annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA).

Note : This plan [does not include] [incl udes] a preexisting condition exclusion. (continued on next page) B-2 ERISA RIGHTS, continued Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for plan particip ants, ERISA imposes dut ies upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the pl an. The people who operate your plan, called \"fiduciaries'' of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against y ou in any way to prevent you from obtaining a plan benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. Enforcing Your Rights If your claim for a plan benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps yo u can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a feder al court. In such a case , the court may require the plan administrator to prov ide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not s ent because of reasons bey ond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or f ederal court. In addition, if you di sagree with the plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualifi ed status of a domestic relati ons order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in federal court. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserti ng your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and f ees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. Assistance with Your Questions If you have any questions about your plan, you s hould contact the plan adm inistrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining document s from the plan administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Se curity Administration, U.S. Depa rtment of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Divisio n of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitu tion Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hot line of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending provider (e.g., your physician, nurse midwife, or physician a ssistant), after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, plans or issuers may not set the level of benefit s or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of t he 48-hour (or 96-hour) stay is treat ed in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a physician or other health care provider obtain authorizatio n for prescribing a length of stay or up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, you may be required to obtain precertification. For information on precer tification, contact your plan administrator. B-5 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT OF 1993 Note : The Family and Medical Leave Act only app lies to groups with 50 or more employees. Under the Family and Medical Le ave Act of 1993 (FMLA), if an em ployee meets the eligibility requirements, that employee is legally allowed to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for one or mo re of the following reasons: for the birth and care of the newborn child of the employee; for placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; to care for an immediate fam ily member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or to take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition. The FMLA was amended to add two new leave right s related to military service, effective January 16, 2009: Qualifying Exigency Leave: Eligible employ ees are entitlted to up to 12 weeks of leave because of \"any qualifying exigen cy\" due to the fact that t he spouse, son, daugheter, or parent of the employee is on active duty, or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status, in support of a contingency operation. Military Caregiver Leave: An eligible employ ee who is the spouse, son, daughter parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty is entit led to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12- month period to care for the servicemember. T he employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks for all types of FMLA leave in the single 12-month period. In order to be eligible, the empl oyee must have worked for his or her employer for a total of 12 months and worked at least 1,250 hour s over the previous 12 months. A covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage for an employee on FMLA leave whenever such insurance was pr ovided before the leave was taken and on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. If applicable, arrangements will need to be made for employees to pay their share of heal th insurance premiums while on leave. In some instances, the employer may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from FMLA leave. An employee should contact his or her employer for details about FMLA and to make payment arrangements, if applicable. Additional information is also available from the U.S. Department of Labor: (1-866-487-9243, TTY: 1-877-899-5627 or http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fm la/finalrule/FMLAPoster.pdf ).

How We Obtain PHI As a managed care plan, we engage in routine activiti es that result in our being given PHI from sources other than you. For example, health care providers\u2014such as physicians and hospitals\u2014submit claim forms containing PHI to enable us to pay them for the covered health care services they have provided to you. B-7 How We Use and Disclose Your PHI We use and disclose PHI in a number of ways to carry out our respons ibilities as a managed care plan. The following describes the type s of uses and disclosures of PHI that federal law permits us to make wit hout your specific authorization: Treatment: We may use and disclose your PHI to health care providers to help them treat you. For example, our care managers may disclose PH I to a home health care agency to make sure you get the services you need after discharge from a hospital. Payment Purposes: We use and disclose your PHI fo r payment purposes, such as paying doctors and hospitals for covered services. Payment purposes also include activities such as: determining eligibility fo r benefits; reviewing services for medical necessity; performing utilization review; obtai ning premiums; coordinating benefits; subrogation; and collection activities. Health Care Operations: We use and disclose your PHI for health care operations. This includes coordinating/managing care; assessi ng and improving the quality of health care services; reviewing the qualifications and perfo rmance of providers; reviewing health plan performance; conducting medical reviews; and resolving grievances. It also includes business activities such as: underwriting; rating; placing or replacing coverage; determining coverage policies; business pla nning; obtaining reinsu rance; arranging for legal and auditing services (including fraud and abuse detection programs); and obtaining accreditations and licenses. Health and Wellness Information: We may use your PHI to contact you with information about appointment reminders; treatment alternatives; therapies; health care providers; settings of care; or other health -related benefits, services and products that may be of interest to you. For example, we might send you information about smoking cessation programs. Organizations That Assist Us: In connection with treatmen t, payment and health care operations, we may share your PHI with our affiliates and third-party \"business associates\" that perform activities for us or on our behalf, for example, our pharmacy benefit manager. We will obt ain assurances from our busi ness associates that they will appropriately safeguard your information. Plan Sponsors: If you are enrolled in Tufts Health Plan through your current or former place of work, you are enrolle d in a group health plan. We may disclose PHI to the group health plan's plan sponsor\u2014 usually your employer\u2014for plan administration purposes. The plan sponsor must certify that it will protect the PHI in accordance with law. Public Health and Safety; Health Oversight : We may disclose your PHI to a public health authority for public health activities , such as responding to public health investigations; when authorized by law, to appropriate authorities, if we reasonably believe you are a victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence; when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to prevent or less en a serious and imminent threat to your or others' health or safety; or to health oversight agencies for certain activities such as audits, disciplinary actions and licensure activity. B-8 Legal Process; Law Enforcement; Sp ecialized Government Activities: We may disclose your PHI in the course of legal proc eedings; in certain cases, in response to a subpoena, discovery request or other lawful proc ess; to law enforcement officials for such purposes as responding to a warrant or subpoena; or for specialized governmental activities such as national security.

Family and Friends: We may disclose PHI to a family member, relative or friend\u2014or anyone else you identify\u2014as follows: (i) when you are present prio r to the use or disclosure and you agree; or (ii) when you are not present (or you are incapacitated or in an emergency situation) if, in the exercise of our prof essional judgment and in our experience with common practice, we determi ne that the disclosure is in your best interests. In these cases we will only disclos e the PHI that is directly relevant to the person's involvement in your health care or payment related to your health care. Personal Representatives: Unless prohibited by law, we may disclose your PHI to your personal representative, if any . A personal represent ative has legal authority to act on your behalf in making decisions related to your health care. For example, a health care proxy, or a parent or guar dian of an unemancipated minor are personal representatives.

See below \"Right to Rece ive Confidential Communications\" for more information on how to make such a request. Required by Law: We may use or disclose your PHI when we are required to do so by law. For example, we must disclose your PHI to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services upon request if they wish to determine whether we are in compliance with federal privacy laws.

You may give us written authorization to use or disclose y our PHI to anyone for any purpose. You may later change your mind and revoke your authoriz ation in writing. However, your written revocation will not affect acti ons we've already taken in re liance on your authorization.

For exam ple, under certain circumstances, records that contain information about alcohol abus e treatment; drug abuse prevention or treatment; AIDS-related testi ng or treatment; or certain privileged communications may not be disclosed without your wr itten authorization. In additi on, when applicable we must have your written authorizat ion before using or disclos ing medical or treatment information for a member appeal.

The Rhode Island calendar yea r 2012 projection, using year -to-date claims and premium experience , is running more favorabl y than what was expected in pricing, after a djusting for the impact of the high cost claims . Small group claims are 3.8% below the expected level, and large group claims are 2.3% below. The current OHIC approved 2013 THP base rates include lower administrative expenses than we believe to be adequate . The lower administrative expenses account for 0.6% of the small group base rate and 1.4% of the large group base ra te. Tufts Health Plan wishes to balance the need for adequate premium with the need for competitive rates in order to gain more membership and remain an active player in the Rhode Island market. With all the above consideration s, THP is requesting a red uction in base rates of 3.2% for small group and 1.0% for large group, effective as soon as practically possible . The Affordable Care Act includes a mandated Women's Preventive Health Services benefit that was effective August 1, 2012. The mandate require s insurance carriers to cover contraceptive drugs and procedures and breastfeeding support services in full with no member cost sharing. THP has analyzed the incremental cost of the mandated benefits and determined that a benefit factor increase of 0.6% wi ll need to be applied to all plans. THP is requesting permission to include this benefit factor increase for both manual and experience rated plans. I certify that the actuarial analys es cited above were developed using sound actuarial assumptions and met hodologies. _________________________ Jen Stevenson , F.S.A., M.A.A.A.

Note : [Under certain circumstances required by law, if your Provider is not in the Tufts Health Plan network, you will be covered for a short period of time for services provided by your physician. A Member Specialist can give you more information. See \"Continuity of Care\" later in this chapter.] No Precertification by You When your Inpatient procedure is provided by a Network Provider , you do no t have to Preregister the procedure. Your Network Provider will Preregister the procedure for you. Canceling Appointments If you have to cancel an appointment with any Network Provider , give him or her at least 24 hours notice. The Network Provider may charge you for missed appointments not canceled in advance. If so, you will have to pay the charges . We will not pay for missed appointments that you did not cancel in advance. Changes to Provider network CareLink offers Members access to an extensive network of physicians, hospitals, and other Providers. They are located throughout the Network Contracting Area . Network Providers may change during the year. This can happen for many reasons. Examples include: a Provider's retirement; moving out of the Network Contracting Area ; or failure to continue to meet credentialing standards. Also, note that Providers are independent contractors. They may leave the network if they do not reach agreement on a network contract. If you have any questions about the availability of a Provider , call Member Services.

We strive to be sure that our financ ial reimbursement syst em: (1) encourages appropriate access to care; and (2) rewards Providers for providing high quality care to our Members . We use a variety of mutua lly agreed upon methods to compensate Network Providers [with whom we contract]. The Directory of Health Care Providers indicates the method of payment for each Provider . Regardless of the method of paym ent, we expect all participating Providers to use sound medical judgment when providing care and when determining whether a re ferral for specialty care is appropriate. This approa ch encourages the provision of Medically Necessary care and reduces the number of unnecessary medical te sts and procedures that can be both harmful and costly to Members . Feel free to discuss specific questions about how he or she is paid with your Provider . Member Identification Card Introduction CareLink gives each Member a member identi fication card (Member ID card). Reporting errors When you receive your Member ID card, check it carefully. If any information is wrong, call Member Services. Identifying yourself as a CareLink Member Your Member ID card is impor tant; it identifies you as a CareLink Member . Please: (1) carry your Member ID card at all time s; (2) have your Member ID card with you for medical, hospital and other appointments and; (3) show your card to any Provider before you receive health care services. When you receive serv ices, tell the staff that you are a CareLink Member . Membership requirement You are eligible for benefits if you are a Member when you receive care. A Member ID card alone is not enough to get you benefits. If you receive care when you are not a Member , you are responsible for the cost. Membership identification number If you have any questions about your memb er identification number, call a CareLink Member Specialist. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. To contact Member Services, call 1-866-352-9114. Or see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. 1-6Utilization Review Utilization review The purpose of the CareLink utilization review program is to control health care costs. It does this by evaluating whether health care services provided to Members are: (1) Medically Necessary; and (2) provided in the most appropria te and efficient manner. [This program sometimes includes prospective, concurrent, and retrospective review of health care services.] [We use prospective review to determine if proposed treatment is Medically Necessary . This review happens before that treat ment begins. It is also ca lled \"Pre-Service Review\". We use concurrent review to: (1) monitor the course of tr eatment as it occurs; and (2) to determine when that tr eatment is no longer Medically Necessary . We use retrospective review to evaluate care after it is provided.Sometimes, we use retrospective review to more accurately decide if a Member's health care services are appropriate. It is also calle d \"Post-Service Review\". ] [TIMEFRAMES FOR TUFTS HEALTH PLAN TO REVIEW YOUR COVERAGE REQUEST Type of Review: Timeframe for Determinations:[*] Prospective (Pre-Service) Review.

U nder this program, we: (1) encourage the use of the most appropriate and cost-effe ctive treatment; and (2) support the Member's treatment and progress. We may contact the Member and his or her Network Provider . We may do this to discuss a treatment plan and establish short and long te rm goals. A Specialty Case Manager may suggest alternative treatment settings available to the Member . We may periodically review the Member's treatment plan. We will contact the Member and the Member's Network Provider if we identify alternatives to the Member's current treatment plan that: qualify as Covered Services; are cost effective; and are appropriate for the Member . A Severe Illness or Injury includes, but is not limited to, the following: high-risk pregnancy and newborn Children ; serious heart or lung disease; cancer; certain neurological diseases; AIDS or other immune system diseases; severe traumatic injury. certain mental health condition s, including substance abuse; [Individual case management (ICM)] [In certain circumstances, CareLink may approve an individual ca se management (\"ICM\") plan for a Member with a Severe Illness or Injury. The IC M plan is designed to arrange for the most appropriate type, level, and setting of health care services and supplies for the Member . As a part of the ICM plan, CareLink may approve coverage for alternative services and supplies that do not other wise qualify as Covered Services for that Member . This will occur only if Tufts Health Plan determines, in its sole discretion, that a ll of the following condi tions are satisfied: the Member's condition is expected to require medi cal treatment for an extended duration; the alternative services and supplies are Medically Necessary ; the alternative services and supplies are provided directly to the Member with the condition; the alternative services and supplies are in pl ace of more expensive treatment that qualifies as Covered Services ; the Member and an Authorized Reviewer agree to the alternative treatment program; and the Member continues to show improvement in his or her condition, as determined periodically by an Authorized Reviewer . CareLink may approve an ICM plan. If this happens, CareLink will also indicate the Covered Service that the ICM plan will replace. The benefit available for the ICM plan will be limited to the benefit that the Member would have received for the Covered Service . Tufts Health Plan will periodically monitor the appropriateness of the alternative services and supplies provided to the Member . CareLink may decide, at any time, that these services and supplies fail to satisfy any of the c onditions described above. In this event, CareLink may modify or terminate coverage for the services or supplies provided pursuant to the ICM plan.] Italicized words are defined in Appendix A.

This Coordination of Benefit s (\"COB\") provision applies to Th is Plan when an employee or the employee's covered dependent has health care co verage under more than one Plan. \"Plan\" and \"This Plan\" are defined below. B. If this COB provision applies, t he order of benefit det ermination rules should be looked at first. Those rules determine whether the benefits of \"Thi s Plan\" are determined be fore or after those of another plan. The benefits of \"This Plan\": (1) shall not be reduced when, under the order of benefit determination rules, \"This Plan\" determines its benefits bef ore another plan; but Italicized words are defi ned in this Appendix A. 7-4 To contact Member Services, call 1-866-352-9114. Or see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. (2) may be reduced when, under the order of benefits determinati onrules, another plan determines its benefits first. T he above reduction is described in the \"Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" \" section below. Italicized words are defi ned in this Appendix A. 7-5 To contact Member Services, call 1-866-352-9114. Or see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Definitions A. \"Plan\" is any of the following which provides benef its or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (1) Group insurance or group-type coverage whet her insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, group practice or individual practice coverage. It also in cludes coverage other than school accident-type coverage. (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or coverage required to be provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (T itle XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs, of the United States Social Securi ty Act, as amended from time to time). Each contract or ot her arrangement for coverage under (1 ) or (2) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate plan. B. \"This Plan\" is the part of the Group Contract that provides benefits for health care expenses. C. \"Primary Plan/Secondary Plan: \" The order of benefit determinat ion rules state whether \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan as to another plan covering th e person. When \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan, its benef its are determined before those of the other plan and without considering the other plan's benef its. When \"This Plan\" is a Se condary Plan, its benefits are determined after those of the other plan and may be reduced because of the other plan's benefits. When there ar e more than two plans covering t he person, \"This Plan\" may be a Primary Plan as to one or more other plans, and may be a Secondary Plan as to a different plan or plans. D. \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessary, r easonable and customary item of expense for health care; when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more plans covering the person for whom the claim is made. The di fference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi-private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense under the above definition unless t he patient's stay in a privat e hospital room is medically necessary either in terms of generally accepted m edical practice, or as specifically defined in the plan. When a plan provides benefits in the form of services , the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. E. \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no coverage under \"This Plan\", or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. Italicized words are defi ned in this Appendix A. 7-6 To contact Member Services, call 1-866-352-9114. Or see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits, continued Order of Benefit Determination Rules A. General. When there is a basis for a claim under \"This Plan\" and another plan, \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan which has its benefits determined after those of the other plan, unless: (1) The other plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those of \"This Plan\"; and (2) Both those rules and \"This Plan\"'s rules, in Subsection B below, require that \"This Plan\"'s benefits be determined before th ose of the other plan. B. Rules. \"This Plan\" determines its order of benefits using the fi rst of the following rules which applies: (1) Non-Dependent/Dependent. The benefits of the plan which covers the person as an employee, member or subscr iber (that is, other than as a dependent) are determined before those of the plan which co vers the person as a dependent. (2) Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divor ced. Except as stated in Paragraph B(3) below, when \"This Plan\" and another plan cover t he same child as a dependent of different person, called \"parents:\" (a) The benefits of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before those of the pl an of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; but (b) If both parents have the same birthday, t he benefits of the plan which covered the parents longer are determined be fore those of the plan whic h covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. However, if the other plan does not have the rule described in (a) immediately above, but instead has the rule based upon the gender of the patient, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other plan will determine the order of benefits. Italicized words are defi ned in this Appendix A. 7-7 To contact Member Services, call 1-866-352-9114. Or see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued (3) Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced. If two or more plans cover a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for t he child are determined in this order: (a) First, the plan of the par ent with custody of the child; (b) Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and (c) Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a court dec ree state that one of th e parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of t hat parent has actual k nowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. The plan of the othe r parent shall be the Secondary Plan. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any Cla im Determination Period or Plan year during which any benefits are actually paid or provided before the ent ity has that actual knowledge. (4) Joint Custody. If the specific terms of a court decree state t hat the parents shall share joint custody, without stating t hat one of the parents is responsib le for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering the child shall follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined above in Paragraph B(2) of this section. (5) Active/Inactive Employee. The benefits of a plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as that employee's dependent ) are determined before those of a plan which covers t hat person as a laid off or re tired employee (or as that employee's dependent). If the othe r plan does not have this rule , and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benef its, this Rule (5) is ignored. (6) Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the plan which covered an employee, me mber or subscriber longer are determined before those of the Plan which covered that person for the shorter term. Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" A. When This Section Applies. This section applies when, in accordan ce with the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section above, \"This Pl an\" is a Secondary Plan as to one or more other plans. In that event the benefits of \"This Plan\" may be r educed under this section. Such other plan or plans are referred to as \"the other plans\" in B immediately below. B. Reduction in \"This Plan\"'s Benefits. The benef its of \"This Plan\" will be reduced when the sum of: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under \"This Plan\" in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under the other plans, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this CO B provision, whether or not claim is made, exceeds those Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the benefits of \"This Plan\" will be r educed so that they and the benefits payable under the other plans do not total more than t hose Allowable Expenses. When the benefits of \"This Plan\" are reduced as described above , each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of \"This Plan\".

Tufts Health Plan need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under \"This Plan\" must give Tufts Health Plan any facts it needs to pay the claim. Facility of Payment A payment made under another plan may include an amount which should have been paid under \"This Plan\". If it does, Tufts Health Plan may pay that amount to the organization which made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a be nefit paid under \"This Plan\".

B-2 ERISA Rights, continued Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for plan particip ants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the pl an. The people who operate your plan, called \"fiduciaries'' of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against y ou in any way to prevent you from obtaining a plan benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. Enforcing Your Rights If your claim for a plan benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules.

In such a case , the court may require the plan administrator to prov ide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not s ent because of reasons be yond the control of the administrator.

The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and f ees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.

Military Caregiver Leave: An eligible empl oyee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered servicemember who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active dut y is entitled to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12-month period to care for the servic emember. The employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks for all types of FM LA leave in the single 12-month period. In order to be eligible, the empl oyee must have worked for his or her employer for a total of 12 months and worked at least 1,250 hour s over the previous 12 months. A covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage for an employee on FMLA leave whenever such insurance was pr ovided before the leave was taken and on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. If applicable, arrangements will need to be made for employees to pay their share of heal th insurance premiums while on leave. In some instances, the employer may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from FMLA leave. An employee should contact his or her employer for details about FMLA and to make payment arrangements, if applicable.

PHI is information which: Identifies you (or can reasonably be used to identify you); and Relates to your physical or mental health or condition, the provision of health care to you or the payment for that care. We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your PHI and to provi de you with notice of our legal duties and privacy prac tices with respect to y our PHI. This Notice of Privacy Practices describes how we may colle ct, use and disclose your PHI, and your rights concerning your PHI. This Noti ce applies to all members of Tufts Health Plan's insured health benefit plans, including: HMO plans; Tufts Health Plan Medicare Preferred plans; and insured POS and PPO plans.

Unless your employer has notified you otherwise, this Notice of Privacy Practices also applies to al l members of self-insur ed group health plans that are administered by a Tufts Health Plan entity. How We Obtain PHI As a managed care plan, we engage in routine activiti es that result in our being given PHI from sources other than you. For example, health care providers\u2014such as physicians and hospitals\u2014submit claim forms containing PHI to enable us to pay them for the covered health care services they have provided to you. B-7 How We Use and Disclose Your PHI We use and disclose PHI in a number of ways to carry out our respons ibilities as a managed care plan. The following describes the type s of uses and disclosures of PHI that federal law permits us to make without your specific authorization: Treatment: We may use and disclose your PHI to health care providers to help them treat you. For example, our care managers may disclose PH I to a home health care agency to make sure you get the services you need after discharge from a hospital. Payment Purposes: We use and disclose your PHI fo r payment purposes, such as paying doctors and hospitals for covered services. Payment purposes also include activities such as: determining eligibility fo r benefits; reviewing services for medical necessity; performing utilization review; obtai ning premiums; coordinating benefits; subrogation; and collection activities. Health Care Operations: We use and disclose your PHI for health care operations. This includes coordinating/managing care; assessi ng and improving the quality of health care services; reviewing the qualifications and perfo rmance of providers; reviewing health plan performance; conducting medical reviews; and resolving grievances. It also includes business activities such as: underwriting; rating; placing or replacing coverage; determining coverage policies; business pla nning; obtaining reinsu rance; arranging for legal and auditing services (including fraud and abuse detection programs); and obtaining accreditations and licenses. Health and Wellness Information: We may use your PHI to contact you with information about appointment reminders; treatment alternatives; therapies; health care providers; settings of care; or other health -related benefits, services and products that may be of interest to you. For example, we might send you information about smoking cessation programs. Organizations That Assist Us: In connection with treatmen t, payment and health care operations, we may share your PHI with our affiliates and third-party \"business associates\" that perform activities for us or on our behalf, for example, our pharmacy benefit manager. We will obt ain assurances from our busi ness associates that they will appropriately safeguard your information. Plan Sponsors: If you are enrolled in Tufts Health Plan through your current or former place of work, you are enrolle d in a group health plan. We may disclose PHI to the group health plan's plan sponsor\u2014 usually your employer\u2014for plan administration purposes. The plan sponsor must certify that it will protect the PHI in accordance with law. Public Health and Safety; Health Oversight : We may disclose your PHI to a public health authority for public health activities , such as responding to public health investigations; when authorized by law, to appropriate authorities, if we reasonably believe you are a victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence; when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to prevent or less en a serious and imminent threat to your or others' health or safety; or to health oversight agencies for certain activities such as audits, disciplinary actions and licensure activity. B-8 Legal Process; Law Enforcement; Sp ecialized Government Activities: We may disclose your PHI in the course of legal proc eedings; in certain cases, in response to a subpoena, discovery request or other lawful proc ess; to law enforcement officials for such purposes as responding to a warrant or subpoena; or for specialized governmental activities such as national security. Research; Death; Organ Donation: We may disclose your PHI to researchers, provided that certain established meas ures are taken to protect y our privacy. We may disclose PHI, in certain instances, to coroners, m edical examiners and in connection with organ donation. Workers' Compensation: We may disclose your PHI wh en authorized by workers' compensation laws. Family and Friends: We may disclose PHI to a family member, relative or friend\u2014or anyone else you identify\u2014as follows: (i) when you are present prio r to the use or disclosure and you agree; or (ii) when you are not present (or you are incapacitated or in an emergency situation) if, in the exercise of our prof essional judgment and in our experience with common practice, we determi ne that the disclosure is in your best interests. In these cases we will only disclos e the PHI that is directly relevant to the person's involvement in your health care or payment related to your health care. Personal Representatives: Unless prohibited by law, we may disclose your PHI to your personal representative, if any. A personal repres entative has legal authority to act on your behalf in making decisions related to your health care. For example, a health care proxy, or a parent or guar dian of an unemancipated minor are personal representatives. Mailings: We will mail information containing PHI to the address we have on record for the subscriber of your heal th benefits plan. We will not make separate mailings for enrolled dependents at different addresses, unless we are requested to do so and agree to the request. See below \"Right to Rece ive Confidential Communications\" for more information on how to make such a request. Required by Law: We may use or disclose your PHI when we are required to do so by law. For example, we must disclose your PHI to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services upon request if they wish to determine whether we are in compliance with federal privacy laws. If one of the above reasons does not apply, we will not use or disclose your PHI without your written permi ssion (\"authorization\"). You may give us written authorization to use or disclose y our PHI to anyone for any purpose. You may later change your mind and revoke your authoriz ation in writing. However, your written revocation will not affect acti ons we've already taken in re liance on your authorization. Where state or other federal laws offer you greater privacy protections, we will follow those more stringent requirements. For exam ple, under certain circumstances, records that contain information about alcohol abus e treatment; drug abuse prevention or treatment; AIDS-related testi ng or treatment; or certain privileged communications may not be disclosed without your wr itten authorization. In additi on, when applicable we must have your written authorizat ion before using or disclos ing medical or treatment information for a member appeal. See below , \"Who to Contact for Questions or Complaints,\" if you would like more information.

The Network Provider may charge you for missed appointments not canceled in advance. If so, you will have to pay the charges . We will not pay for missed appointments that you did not cancel in advance. Changes to Provider network We offer Members access to an extensive network of physicians, hospitals, and other Providers. They are located throughout the Network Contracting Area . Network Providers may change during the year. This can happen for many reasons . Examples include: a Provider's retirement; moving out of the Network Contracting Area ; or failure to continue to meet cr edentialing standards. Also, note that Providers are independent contractors. They may leave the network if they do not reach agreement on a network contract. If you have any questions about the availability of a Provider , call Member Services. Out-of-Network Level of Benefits Out-of-Network Level of Benefits You may get care from a Non-Network Provider. If so, your cover age will be at the Out-of- Network Level of Benefits .

Financial Arrangements between Tufts Health Plan and Network Providers Methods of payment to Network Providers Our goal in paying Providers is to encourage preventive care and active illness management. We strive to be sure that our financial reim bursement system: (1 ) encourages appropriate access to care; and (2) rewards Providers for providing high quality care to our Members . We use a variety of mutually agreed upon methods to compensate Network Providers [with whom we contract]. The Directory of Health Care Providers indicates the method of payment for each Provider . Regardless of the method of paym ent, we expect all participating Providers to use sound medical judgment when providing care and when determining whether a referral for specialty care is appropriate. This approach encourages the provision of Medically Necessary care and reduces the number of unnecessary medical tests and procedur es that can be both harmful and costly to Members . Feel free to discuss specific questions about how he or she is paid with your Provider . Member Identification Card Introduction We give each Member a member identification card (Member ID card). Reporting errors When you receive your Member ID card, check it carefully. If any information is wrong, call Member Services. Identifying yourself as a Tufts Health Plan Member Your Member ID card is impor tant; it identifies you as a Tufts Health Plan Member . Please: (1) carry your Member ID card at all times; (2) have your Member ID card with you for medical, hospital and other appoint ments; and (3) show your card to any Provider before you receive health care services. When you receive services, tell the st aff that you are a Tufts Health Plan Member . Membership requirement You are eligible for benefits if you are a Member when you receive care. A Member ID card alone is not enough to get you benefits. If you receive care when you are not a Member , you are responsible for the cost. Membership identification number If you have any questions about your member ident ification number, call a Member Specialist. Italicized words are defined in Appendix A.

Or see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. 1-6Utilization Management Utilization management The purpose of the utilization m anagement program is to control health care costs. It does this by evaluating whether health care services provided to Members are: (1) Medically Necessary ; and (2) provided in the most appropria te and efficient manner. [This program sometimes includes prospective, concurrent , and retrospective review of health care services.] [We use prospective review to determine if proposed treatment is Medically Necessary . This review happens before that treat ment begins. It is also ca lled \"Pre-Service Review\". We use concurrent review to: (1) monitor the course of treatment as it occurs; and (2) to determine when that tr eatment is no longer Medically Necessary . We use retrospective review to evaluate care after it is provided. Sometimes, we use retrospective review to more accurately decide if a Member's health care services are appropriate. It is also call ed \"Post-Service Review\". ] [TIMEFRAMES FOR TUFTS HEALTH PLAN TO REVIEW YOUR COVERAGE REQUEST Type of Review: Timeframe for Determinations:[*] Prospective (Pre-Service) Review. Urgen t: [Within 72 hours of receipt of the request.] [Within 72 hour s of receiving all necessary information.] Non-urgent: [Within 15 business days of receipt of the request.] [Within 15 business days of receiving all necessary information.] Concurrent Review.

Under this program, we: (1) encourage the use of the most appropriate and cost-effe ctive treatment; and (2) support the Member's treatment and progress. We may contact the Member and his or her Network Provider . We may do this to discuss a treatment plan and establish short and long term goals. A Specialty Case Manager may suggest alternative treatment settings available to the Member . We may periodically review the Member's treatment plan. We will contact the Member and the Member's Network Provider if we identify alternatives to the Member's current treatment plan are identified that: qualify as Covered Services ; are cost effective; and are appropriate for the Member . A Severe Illness or Injury includes, but is not limited to, the following: high-risk pregnancy and newborn Children ; serious heart or lung disease; cancer; certain neurological diseases; AIDS or other immune system diseases; severe traumatic injury. certain mental health condition s, including substance abuse; [Individual case management (ICM)] [In certain circumstances, we may approve an i ndividual case management (\"ICM\") plan for a Member with a Severe Illness or Injury. The ICM plan is designed to arrange for the most appropriate type, level, and setting of health care services and supplies for the Member . As a part of the ICM plan, we may approve cove rage for alternative services and supplies that do not otherwise qualify as Covered Services for that Member . This will occur only if Tufts Health Plan determines, in its sole discretion, that a ll of the following condi tions are satisfied: the Member's condition is expected to require medi cal treatment for an extended duration; the alternative services and supplies are Medically Necessary ; the alternative services and supplies are provided directly to the Member with the condition; the alternative services and supplies are in plac e of more expensive treatment that qualifies as Covered Services ; the Member and Tufts Health Plan or its designee agree to the al ternative treatment program; and the Member continues to show improvement in his or her condition. Tufts Health Plan or its designee will determine this periodically. We may approve an ICM plan. If th is happens, we will also indicate the Covered Service that the ICM plan will replace. The benefit available for the ICM plan will be limited to the benefit that the Member would have received for the Covered Service . Tufts Health Plan will periodically monitor the appropriateness of the alternative services and supplies provided to the Member . We may decide, at any ti me, that these services and supplies fail to satisfy any of the conditions described above. In this event, we may modify or terminate coverage for the services or s upplies provided pursuant to the ICM plan.] Italicized words are defined in Appendix A.

A review team will: (1) verify eligibility at that time; and (2) assign an anticipated length-of-stay guideline if the admission is approved. The review team may also review your proposed medical care, verify Medical Necessity or recommend an alternative treatment setting. Preregistration does not guarantee payment. We are not obli gated to pay claims that have been Preregistered for: (1) pers ons who are not Members on the date of service; (2) who are not eligible for coverage ; (3) who receiv e care that is determined not to be Medically Necessary ; or (4) if the claim is not for a Covered Service . If you get care at the In-Network Level of Benefits, your Network Provider is responsible for Preregistering your Inpatient admission or transfer. You do not need to Preregister the admission or transfer. Extension of Hospitalization All Inpatient hospitalizations are monitored. It may be Medically Necessary for you to stay in the hospital longer than the originally approved length-of-stay. If this happens, Tufts Health Plan staff will request additional clinical information from your attending Provider or hospital so that we can approve a longer hospital stay, if Medically Necessary . Additional Medically Necessary hospital days may be authorized. Note : After consulting your Provider, we may determine that Inpatient hospitalization is no longer Medically Necessary . If this happens, we will notify y ou that any additional hospital days will not be covered. You will be responsible for paying for all hospital and Provider charges if you choose to stay in the hospital beyond the discharge date. ] Italicized words are defined in Appendix A. 2-1 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059.

These are drugs wit h a narrow indication for usage, may have safety concerns and/or are extremel y expensive. We require the prescribing Provider to obtain prior approval from us for such drugs.] Step Therapy PA Program Step therapy is a type of prior aut horization program (usua lly automated). This program uses a step- wise approach. It requires the us e of the most therapeutically a ppropriate and cost-effective agents first. After tha t, other medications may be covered.

USERRA also prohibits employers from discriminating against past and present members of the uniformed services, and applicants to the uniformed services. Under USERRA: You have the right to be reemployed in your ci vilian job if you leave that job to perform service in the uniformed service, and (1) you ens ure that your employer receives advance written or verbal notice of your service; (2 ) you have five years or less of cumulative service in the uniformed service while with that particular employer; (3) you return to work or apply for reemployment in a timely manner a fter conclusion of service; and (4) you have not been separated from service with a di squalifying discharge or under other than honorable conditions. If you are eligible to be reemployed, you must be restored to the job and benefits you would have attained if you had not been absent due to military service, or, in some cases, a comparable job. If you are a past or present member of the uniformed service, have applied for membership in the uniformed service, or are obligated to service in the uniformed service, then an employer may not deny you initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment b bec ause of this status. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against any assisti ng in the enforcement of USERRA rights, including test ifying or making a statement in connection with a proceeding under USERRA, even if that per son has no service connection. If you leave your job to perform military service, you have the right to elect to continue your existing employer-based health plan coverage for you and your Dependents for up to 24 months while in the military. If you don't elect to continue coverage during your military service, you have the right to be reinstated in your employer's health plan when you are reem ployed, generally without any waiting periods or exclusions (for example, pre-existing c ondition exclusions) except for service-connected illnesses or injuries. Service members may be required to pay up to 102% of the premium for the health plan coverage. If coverage is for less than 31 days, the service member is only required to pay the employee share, if any, for such coverage. USERRA coverage runs concurrently with CO BRA and other state continuation coverage.

This Coordination of Benefit s (\"COB\") provision applies to Th is Plan when an employee or the employee's covered dependent has health care co verage under more than one Plan. \"Plan\" and \"This Plan\" are defined below. B. If this COB provision applies, the order of benefit det ermination rules should be looked at first. Those rules determine whether the benefits of \"Thi s Plan\" are determined be fore or after those of another plan. The benefits of \"This Plan\": (1) shall not be reduced when, under the order of benefit dete rmination rules, \"This Plan\" determines its benefits bef ore another plan; but (2) may be reduced when, under the order of benefits determinati onrules, another plan determines its benefits first. T he above reduction is described in the \"Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" \" section below. Italicized words are defi ned in this Appendix A. 7-5 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Definitions A. \"Plan\" is any of the following which provides benef its or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (1) Group insurance or group-type coverage whet her insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, group practice or individual practice coverage. It also in cludes coverage other than school accident-type coverage. (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or coverage required to be provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (T itle XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs, of the United States Social Securi ty Act, as amended from time to time). Each contract or ot her arrangement for coverage under (1 ) or (2) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate plan. B. \"This Plan\" is the part of the Group Contract that provides benefits for health care expenses. C. \"Primary Plan/Secondary Plan: \" The order of benefit determinat ion rules state whether \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan as to another plan covering the person. When \"This Plan\" is a Primary Plan, its benef its are determined before those of the other plan and without considering the other plan's benef its. When \"This Plan\" is a Se condary Plan, its benefits are determined after those of the other plan and may be reduced bec ause of the other plan's benefits. When there ar e more than two plans covering t he person, \"This Plan\" may be a Primary Plan as to one or more other plans, and may be a Secondary Plan as to a different plan or plans. D. \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessary, r easonable and customary it em of expense for health care; when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more plans covering the person for whom the claim is made. The di fference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi-private hospital r oom is not considered an Allowable Expense under the above definition unless t he patient's stay in a privat e hospital room is medically necessary either in terms of generally accepted m edical practice, or as sp ecifically defined in the plan. When a plan provides benefits in the form of services , the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. E. \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar y ear. However, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no coverage under \"This Plan\", or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. Italicized words are defi ned in this Appendix A. 7-6 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Order of Benefit Determination Rules A. General. When there is a basis for a claim under \"This Plan\" and another plan, \"This Plan\" is a Secondary Plan which has its benefits determined after those of the other plan, unless: (1) The other plan has rules coordinating it s benefits with those of \"This Plan\"; and (2) Both those rules and \"This Plan's\"' rules, in Subsection B below, require that \"This Plan's\" benefits be determined before th ose of the other plan. B. Rules. \"This Plan\" determines it s order of benefits using the firs t of the following rules which applies: (1) Non-Dependent/Dependent. The benefits of the plan which covers the person as an employee, member or subscr iber (that is, other than as a dependent) are determined before those of the plan which co vers the person as a dependent. (2) Dependent Child/Parents Not Separ ated or Divorced. Except as stated in Paragraph B(3) below, when \"This Plan\" and another plan cover t he same child as a dependent of different person, called \"parents:\" (a) The benefits of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before those of the pl an of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; but (b) If both parents have the same birthday, t he benefits of the plan which covered the parents longer are determined be fore those of the plan whic h covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. However, if the other plan does not have the rule described in (a) immediately above, but instead has the rule based upon the gender of the patient, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other plan will determine the order of benefits. (3) Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced. If two or more plans cover a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for t he child are determined in this order: (a) First, the plan of the par ent with custody of the child; (b) Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and (c) Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a court dec ree state that one of th e parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of t hat parent has actual k nowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. The plan of the othe r parent shall be the Secondary Plan. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any Cla im Determination Period or Plan year during which any benefits are actually paid or provided before the ent ity has that actual knowledge. Italicized words are defi ned in this Appendix A. 7-7 To contact Member Services, call 1-800-682-8059. Or, see our Web site at www.tuftshealthplan.com. Coordination of This Group Contract's Benefits with Other Benefits , continued Order of Benefit Determination Rules, continued (4) Joint Custody. If the specific terms of a c ourt decree state that the parents shall share joint custody, without stating t hat one of the parents is responsib le for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering the child shall follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined above in Paragraph B(2) of this section. (5) Active/Inactive Employee. The benefits of a plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as that employee's dependent ) are determined before those of a plan which covers t hat person as a laid off or re tired employee (or as that employee's dependent). If the othe r plan does not have this rule , and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benef its, this Rule (5) is ignored. (6) Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the plan which covered an employee, me mber or subscriber longer are determined before those of the Plan which covered that person for the shorter term. Effect on the Benefits of \"This Plan\" A. When This Section Applies. This section applies when, in accordan ce with the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section above, \"This Pl an\" is a Secondary Plan as to one or more other plans. In that event the benefits of \"This Plan\" may be r educed under this section. Such other plan or plans are referred to as \"the other plans\" in B immediately below. B. Reduction in \"This Plan\"'s Benefits. The benef its of \"This Plan\" will be reduced when the sum of: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under \"This Plan\" in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under the other plans, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this CO B provision, whether or not claim is made, exceeds those Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the benefits of \"This Plan\" will be r educed so that they and the benefits payable under the other plans do not total more than t hose Allowable Expenses. When the benefits of \"This Plan\" are reduced as described above , each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of \"This Plan\". Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules. Tufts Health Plan has the right to decide which facts it needs. It may get needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person. Tufts Health Plan need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under \"This Plan\" must give Tufts Health Plan any facts it needs to pay the claim. Facility of Payment A payment made under another plan may incl ude an amount which should have been paid under \"This Plan\". If it does, Tufts Health Plan may pay that amount to the organization which made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a be nefit paid under \"This Plan\". Tufts Health Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" means reasonable cash value of the benefit s provided in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services.

Most plans are ERISA plans, but not all. Please contact your plan admini strator to determine if your plan is an ERISA plan. ERISA provides that all plan par ticipants shall be entitled to receive information about their plan and benefits, continue group health plan coverage, and prudent actions by plan fiduciaries. Receiving Information About Your Plan and Benefits ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to: Examine, without charge, at t he plan administrator's office and at other specified locations, all documents governing the plan, including in surance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and a copy of the la test annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA). Obtain, upon written request to the plan admini strator, copies of documents governing the operation of the plan, includi ng insurance contracts and co llective bargaining agreements, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and updated summary plan description. The plan administrator may make a Reasonable Charge for the copies. Receive a summary of the plan's annual financia l report.

Without evidence of creditable cove rage, you may be subject to a preexisting condition exclusion for 12 months (18 months for late enrollees) after your enrollment date in your coverage. Note : This plan [does not include] [incl udes] a preexisting condition exclusion. (continued on next page) B-2 ERISA RIGHTS, continued Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for plan particip ants, ERISA imposes dut ies upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the pl an. The people who operate your plan, called \"fiduciaries'' of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against y ou in any way to prevent you from obtaining a plan benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. Enforcing Your Rights If your claim for a plan benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps yo u can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a feder al court. In such a case , the court may require the plan administrator to prov ide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not s ent because of reasons bey ond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or f ederal court. In addition, if you di sagree with the plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualifi ed status of a domestic relati ons order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in federal court. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserti ng your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and f ees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. Assistance with Your Questions If you have any questions about your plan, you s hould contact the plan adm inistrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining document s from the plan administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Se curity Administration, U.S. Depa rtment of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Divisio n of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitu tion Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hot line of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending provider (e.g., your physician, nurse midwife, or physician a ssistant), after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, plans or issuers may not set the level of benefit s or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of t he 48-hour (or 96-hour) stay is treat ed in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a physician or other health care provider obtain authorizatio n for prescribing a length of stay or up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, you may be required to obtain precertification. For information on precer tification, contact your plan administrator. B-5 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT OF 1993 Note : The Family and Medical Leave Act only app lies to groups with 50 or more employees. Under the Family and Medical Le ave Act of 1993 (FMLA), if an em ployee meets the eligibility requirements, that employee is legally allowed to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for one or mo re of the following reasons: for the birth and care of the newborn child of the employee; for placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; to care for an immediate fam ily member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or to take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition. The FMLA was amended to add two new leave right s related to military service, effective January 16, 2009: Qualifying Exigency Leave: Eligible employ ees are entitlted to up to 12 weeks of leave because of \"any qualifying exigen cy\" due to the fact that t he spouse, son, daugheter, or parent of the employee is on active duty, or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status, in support of a contingency operation. Military Caregiver Leave: An eligible employ ee who is the spouse, son, daughter parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty is entit led to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12- month period to care for the servicemember. T he employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks for all types of FMLA leave in the single 12-month period. In order to be eligible, the empl oyee must have worked for his or her employer for a total of 12 months and worked at least 1,250 hour s over the previous 12 months. A covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage for an employee on FMLA leave whenever such insurance was pr ovided before the leave was taken and on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. If applicable, arrangements will need to be made for employees to pay their share of heal th insurance premiums while on leave. In some instances, the employer may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from FMLA leave. An employee should contact his or her employer for details about FMLA and to make payment arrangements, if applicable. Additional information is also available from the U.S. Department of Labor: (1-866-487-9243, TTY: 1-877-899-5627 or http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fm la/finalrule/FMLAPoster.pdf ).

The Rhode Island calendar yea r 2012 projection, using year -to-date claims and premium experience , is running more favorabl y than what was expected in pricing, after a djusting for the impact of the high cost claims . Small group claims are 3.8% below the expected level, and large group claims are 2.3% below. The current OHIC approved 2013 THP base rates include lower administrative expenses than we believe to be adequate . The lower administrative expenses account for 0.6% of the small group base rate and 1.4% of the large group base ra te. Tufts Health Plan wishes to balance the need for adequate premium with the need for competitive rates in order to gain more membership and remain an active player in the Rhode Island market. With all the above consideration s, THP is requesting a red uction in base rates of 3.2% for small group and 1.0% for large group, effective as soon as practically possible . The Affordable Care Act includes a mandated Women's Preventive Health Services benefit that was effective August 1, 2012. The mandate require s insurance carriers to cover contraceptive drugs and procedures and breastfeeding support services in full with no member cost sharing. THP has analyzed the incremental cost of the mandated benefits and determined that a benefit factor increase of 0.6% wi ll need to be applied to all plans. THP is requesting permission to include this benefit factor increase for both manual and experience rated plans. I certify that the actuarial analys es cited above were developed using sound actuarial assumptions and met hodologies. _________________________ Jen Stevenson , F.S.A., M.A.A.A.
