The method of aggregation plays a great role in decision-making problems, particularly when there are more conflicting criteria. The purpose of this article is to present novel operational laws based on the Yager t-norm and t-conorm under spherical hesitant fuzzy information. Furthermore, based on the Yager operational laws, we develop the list of Yager weighted averaging and Yager weighted geometric aggregation operators. The basic fundamental properties of the proposed operators are given in detail. We design an algorithm to address the uncertainty and ambiguity information in multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) problems. Finally, a numerical example related to Parkinson disease is presented for the proposed model. To show the supremacy of the proposed algorithms, a comparative analysis of the proposed techniques with some existing approaches and with validity test is presented.", "sitename": "AIMS Mathematics", "date": "2021-08-09", "cleaned_text": "| [1] || S.
