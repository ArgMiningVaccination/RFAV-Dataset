Barnes-Durity, MD Family Medicine Doctor, Primary Care Doctor My Locations About Me I appreciate the opportunity to develop a healing relationship with my patients. It is important to me to engage in healthy lifestyles and to make conscientious choices for my health as I encourage others to attain and maintain their best health. I enjoy many different physical activities. I have participated in two half-marathons and many 5Ks. More recently I have come to revel in the gentility and strength of regular yoga practice. I am Jamaican-born, Trinidad and Tobago-bred (a Caribbean person) and moved to North Carolina from New York, in 2001. My family life and faith are of utmost importance to me. I live in Cary with my husband and two wonderful daughters. From newborn to older, and from families and individuals, all are welcome at my practice. My practice is evidenced-based and experienced, I have an openness to holistic and complementary therapies. I strive for optimal life balance personally and, as a doctor, I want all of you to be well.

[Learn more about our survey process.](../duke-health-ratings-and-reviews) Responses are measured on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the best score.
