Dillon, MT 59725 406-834-3413bannack@smtel.comPART I. PROPOSED ACTION DESCRIPTION 1. Type of proposed state action : Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (FWP) proposes building an 18' x 24' shed style pole building on the east side of the existing maintenance facility. The maintenance facilit y was built in 1996 and the original plans included an addition for storage but funding constraints forced the park to cut this feature. The building will consist of 11-13 posts set in concrete approximately 2' deep, board and batten construction, a shed style roof with rolled roofing material covering 5//8\" sheeting. The building will be used to house lumber and other building materials used for preservation and maintenance of the park's buildings. 2. Agency authority for the proposed action: The 1939 Montana State Legislature passed MCA 23-1-101, which states that a State Park System would be established \"for the purpose of conserving the scenic, historic, archaeological, scientific, and recreational resources of the state and providing for their use and enjoyment, thereby contributing to the cultural, recreational, and economic life of the people and their health\". Montana statute 23-1-102 (4) gives FWP \"jurisdiction, custody, and control of all state parks, recreational areas, public camping grounds, historical sites, and monuments\". 3. Name of project: Bannack State Park Pole Building Project 4. Name, address and phone number of project sponsor (if other than the agency): Montana Fish, Wildlife, & Parks is the project sponsor. 5. Construction Timeline : June through September. Construction will be completed by park staff and the regional maintenance crew as time and weather permit. 6. Location affected by proposed action (county, range and township): Section 7, Township 08S, Range 11W. 7.

Narrative summary of the proposed action: The purpose of this project is to provide a covered storage facility for aged building materials used in the preservation and maintenance of the historic buildings at Bannack State Park. Currently there are no covered facilities to store these materials and while these materials are aged naturally outside, long term exposure to the elements causes deterioration and thus financial loss. Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks proposes building a pole building on the east side of the existing maintenance facility to fill this need. The existing maintenance facility was built in 1996 and is situated outside the historic town site in the east end parking area. Our goal is to seamlessly integrate the pole building addition with the maintenance facility by employing the same board and batten finish used in 1996. The shed style pole building was included in the original design of the maintenance facility but was cut because of funding constraints. Figure 1 Figure 2 The building will consist of 11-13 posts set in concrete approximately 2' deep, board and batten construction, a shed style roof with rolled roofing material covering 5/8\" sheeting, and gravel floor. Preservation and maintenance of Bannack's historic buildings is the top priority of the park's staff. This storage facility will protect building Figure 1: The cones represent the approximate location of the proposed pole building relative to the maintenance building. Figure 2: Looking east across the east end parking lot. The addition of the pole building here will not cause any visual distraction from the historic town site. materials from long term exposure to the elements, which will help eliminate waste cause by deterioration and thus be cost effective.

The pole building will employ board and batten construction to match the maintenance facility built in 1996. Visitors rarely visit the project area because it is outside the historic town site. There are people who use this area to gain access to recreational opportunities (horseback riders, bicyclists and fisherman), but the use of board and batten construction will help the pole building blend in with the existing maintenance facility and be virtually un-noticeable to visitors. 12. CULTURAL/HISTORICAL RESOURCES Will the proposed action result in: IMPACT Can Impact Be Mitigated Comment Index Unknown None Minor Potentially Significant a. Destruction or alteration of any site, structure or object of prehistoric historic, or paleontological importance? X Yes 12a b. Physical change that would affect unique cultural values? X c. Effects on existing religious or sacred uses of a site or area? X d. For P-R/D-J , will the project affect historic or cultural resources? Attach SHPO letter of clearance. (Also see 12.a) X e. Other: X Narrative Description and Evaluation of the Cumulative and Secondary Effects on Land Resources. 12a) The project does require digging 11-13 holes 2' deep and there is a minimal chance that historic objects may be unearthed but the site of the proposed project was disturbed historically by the impact of mining and more recently with power and water lines. Care will be taken to document and preserve all historic objects that may be unearthed. Before construction begins SHPO clearance will obtained. SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA 13. SUMMARY EVALUATION OF SIGNIFICANCE Will the proposed action, considered as a whole: IMPACT Can Impact Be Mitigated Comment Index Unknown None Minor Potentially Significant a. Have impacts that are individually limited, but cumulatively considerable? (A project or program may result in impacts on two or more separate resources that create a significant effect when considered together or in total.) X b. Involve potential risks or adverse effects which are uncertain but extremely hazardous if they were to occur? X c. Potentially conflict with the substantive requirements of any local, state, or federal law, regulation, standard or formal plan? X d. Establish a precedent or likelihood that future actions with significant environmental impacts will be proposed? X e. Generate substantial debate or controversy about the nature of the impacts that would be created? X f. For P-R/D-J , is the project expected to have organized opposition or generate substantial public controversy? X g. For P-R/D-J , list any federal or state permits required. X Narrative Description and Evaluation of the Cumulative and Secondary Effects on Water Resources PART III. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW 1. Description and analysis of reasonable alternatives (including the no action alternative) to the proposed action whenever alternatives are reasonably available and prudent to consider and a discussion of how the alternatives would be implemented: Alternative A: Proposed Action: In the preferred alternative, FWP will build an 18' x 24' shed style pole building adjacent to the existing maintenance facility. The existing maintenance facility was built in 1996 using board and batten construction and the pole building will employ the same building to seamlessly integrate the old and the new. The preferred alternative will create a covered storage facility for building materials, thus limiting deterioration and waste caused by long term exposure to the elements. The proposed action should have a positive financial benefit by limiting waste caused by exposure to the elements. Alternative B: No Action: If no action is taken the park will have to continue as it has in the past, storing building materials in the open and limiting the amount of materials they purchase. Building materials deteriorate after long term exposure to the elements. This limits the quantity of materials on site. 2. Evaluation and listing of mitigation, stipulation, or other control measures enforceable by the agency or another government agency: There are no formal stipulations of mitigation or other controls associated with the proposed action. This action does not involve any permits or granting of a license on which stipulations would be placed. 16PART IV. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION 1. Describe the level of public involvement for this project if any, and, given the complexity and the seriousness of the environmental issues associated with the proposed action, is the level of pub lic involvement appropriate under the circumstances? The public will be notified by way of a statewide press release in the Helena Independent Record , the Dillon Tribune, and the Butte Montana Standard; and by public notice on the Fish, Wildlife & Parks web page: http://fwp.mt.gov/publicnotices . Individual notices will be sent to the region's standard EA distribution list and to those that have requested one. If requested, FWP will hold a public meeting for the proposal. Duration of comment period, if any. A 30-day comment period is proposed. This level of public involvement is appropriate for this scale of project. PART V. EA PREPARATION Based on the significance criteria evaluated in this EA, is an EIS required? (YES/NO)?If an EIS is not required, explain why the EA is the appropriate level of analysis for this proposed action. Based on an evaluation of the primary, secondary, and cumulative impacts to the physical and human environment under the Montana Environmental Protection Act (MEPA), this environmental review found no significant impacts from the proposed Pole Building project at Bannack State Park. In determining the significance of the impacts, FWP assessed the severity, duration, geographic extent, and frequency of the impacts. FWP also assessed the probability that impacts would occur or reasonable assurance that impacts would not occur, and growth-inducing or growth inhibiting aspects of impacts. FWP assessed the importance to the state and to society of the environmental resource or value affected, and precedent that would be set as a result of the proposed action that would commit FWP to future actions; and potential conflicts with local, federal, or state laws. Therefore, an EA is the appropriate level of review and an EIS is not required. 2.

Section 7, Township 8S, Range 11 W. Description of Proposed Work : Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks proposes building an 18' x 24' shed style pole building at Bannack State Park. The proposed pole building will be built adjacent to the existing maintenance facility in the east end parking lot and employ the same style board and batten finish to make the addition almost imperceptible. The building will consist of 11-13 posts set in concrete approximately 2' deep, board and batten construction, a shed style roof with rolled roofing material covering 5/8\" sheeting. When the maintenance facility was built in 1996 a storage facility was included in the design but funding limitations caused the park to cut this element. The following checklist is intended to be a guide for determining whether a proposed development or improvement is of enough significance to fall under HB 495 rules. (Please check all that apply and comment as necessary.) [ ] A. New roadway or trail built over undisturbed land? Comments: None [ X ] B. New building construction (buildings <100 sf and vault latrines exempt)? Comments: The facility will be about 432 sf. [ ] C. Any excavation of 20 c.y. or greater? Comments: The only excavation will consist of 11-13 post holes approximately 2' deep. [ ] D. New parking lots built over undisturbed land or expansion of existing lot that increases parking capacity by 25% or more? Comments: None [ ] E. Any new shoreline alteration that exceeds a double wide boat ramp or handicapped fishing station? Comments: None [ ] F. Any new construction into lakes, reservoirs, or streams? Comments: None 19[ X ] G. Any new construction in an area with National Registry quality cultural artifacts (as determined by State Historical Preservation Office)? Comments: SHPO clearance will be sought before the project begins. [ ] H. Any new above ground utility lines? Comments: None [ ] I. Any increase or decrease in campsites of 25% or more of an existing number of campsites? Comments: None. [ ] J. Proposed project significantly changes the existing features or use pattern; including effects of a series of individual projects? Comments: None If any of the above are checked, HB 495 rules apply to this proposed work and should be documented on the MEPA/HB495 CHECKLIST. Refer to MEPA/HB495 Cross Reference Summary for further assistance. 20APPENDIX B Sensitive Plants and Animals in the Bannack State Park Area A search of the Montana Natural Heritage Program (MNHP) element occurrence database (nhp.nris.state.mt.us/eoportal) indicates no known occurrences of federally listed threatened, endangered, or proposed threatened or endangered plant or animal species in the proposed project site. Species of Concern Terms and Definitions Montana Species of Concern. The term \"Species of Concern\" includes taxa that are at-risk or potentially at-risk due to rarity, restricted distribution, habitat loss, and/or other factors. The term also encompasses species that have a special designation by organizations or land management agencies in Montana, including: Bureau of Land Management Special Status and Watch species; U.S. Forest Service Sensitive and Watch species; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Threatened, Endangered and Candidate species. Status Ranks (Global and State) The international network of Natural Heritage Programs employs a standardized ranking system to denote global ( G -- range-wide) and state status ( S)(NatureServe 2003). Species are assigned numeric ranks ranging from 1 (critically imperiled) to 5 (demonstrably secure), reflecting the relative degree to which they are \"at-risk\". Rank definitions are given below. A number of factors are considered in assigning ranks -- the number, size and distribution of known \"occurrences\" or populations, population trends (if known), habitat sensitivity, and threat. Factors in a species' life history that make it especially vulnerable are also considered (e.g., dependence on a specific pollinator). Status Ranks Code Definition G1 S1At high risk because of extremely limited and/or rapidly declining numbers, range, and/or habitat, making it highly vulnerable to global extinction or extirpation in the state. G2 S2At risk because of very limited and/or declinin g numbers, range, and/or habitat, making it vulnerable to global extinction or extirpation in the state. G3 S3Potentially at risk because of lim ited and/or declining numbers, range, and/or habitat, even though it may be abu ndant in some areas. G4 S4Uncommon but not rare (although it may be rare in parts of its range), and usually widespread. Apparently not vulnerable in most of its rang e, but possibly cause for long-term concern. G5 S5Common, widespread, and abundant (although it may be rare in parts of its range). Not vulnerable in most of its range. 211.Centrocercus urophasianus (Greater Sage-grouse) Natural Heritage Global: G4 U . S . F o r e s t S e r v i c e : Sensitive U.S. Bureau of Land Management: Sensitive A documented lek occurs approximately 1.75 miles north of the proposed project site, but population data is unavailable. It is unlikely that the proposed action would affect this species, as inferred extent of this species range does not overlap with the town site. 2.Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi (Westslope Cutthroat Global: G4T3 U . S . F o r e s t S e r v i c e : U.S. Bureau of Land Management: Sensitive Westslope Cutthroat do not inhabit this section of Grasshopper Creek and this project in no way should affect the creek or the fish population. 3.Buteo regalis (Ferruginous Hawk). Natural Heritage Ranks: Federal Global: G4 U . S . F o r e s t S e r v i c e : U.S. Bureau of Land Management: Sensitive This sensitive species has been regularly observed from 1977 through the present, in short-grass prairie habitat and brushy draws. The full extent of occupied breeding habitat is unknown, but most sightin gs have occurred in the Lima-Sweetwater breaks northwest of Dillon. It is unlikely that the proposed project would affect this species. 4.Perognathus parvus (Great Basin Pocket Mouse). Natural Heritage Ranks: Federal Agency Status: State: S2S3 U.S. Global: G5 U . S . F o r e s t S e r v i c e : U.S. Bureau of Land Management: Sensitive This species was first observed at two survey sites east and west of Badger Pass in 1961.

Please complete the project name and project description portions and submit this form to: Carol Crockett, Visitor Service Manager Montana Office of Tourism-Department of Commerce PO Box 200533 301 S Park Helena, MT 59620-0533 Project Name: Bannack State Park Pole Barn Project Project Location : Bannack State Park, Beaverhead County. Section 7, Township 8S, Range 11W. Project Description: Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (FWP) proposes building an 18' x 24' shed style pole building on the east side of the existing maintenance facility. The maintenance facility was built in 1996 and the original plans included an addition for storage but funding constraints forced the park to cut this feature. The building will consist of 11-13 posts set in concrete approximately 2' deep, board and batten construction, a shed style roof with rolled roofing material covering 5/8\" sheeting. The building will be used to house lumber and other building materials used for preservation and maintenance of the park's buildings. 1.
