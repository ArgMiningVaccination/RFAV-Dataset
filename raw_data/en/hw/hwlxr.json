This study examines outcomes of planned home births in the United States between 2004 and 2009. Methods: We calculated descriptive statistics for maternal demographics, antenatal risk profiles, procedures, and outcomes of planned home births in the Midwives Alliance of North American Statistics Project (MA NA Stats) 2.0 data registry. Data were analyzed according to intended and actual place of birth.Results: Among 16,924 women who planned home births at the onset of labor, 89.1% gave birth at home. The majority of intrapartum transfers were for failure to progress, and only 4.5% of the total sample required oxytocin augmentation and/or epidural analgesia. The rates of spontaneous vaginal birth, assisted vaginal birth, and cesarean were 93.6%, 1.2%, and 5.2%, respectively. Of the 1054 women who attempted a vaginal birth after cesarean, 87% were successful. Low Apgar scores ( /H110217) occurred in 1.5% of newborns. Postpartum maternal (1.5%) and neonatal (0.9%) transfers were infrequent. The majority (86%) of newborns were exclusively breastfeeding at 6 weeks of age. Excluding lethal anomalies, the intrapartum,early neonatal, and late neonatal mortality rates were 1.30, 0.41, and 0.35 per 1000, respectively. Discussion: For this large cohort of women who planned midwife-led home births in the United States, outcomes are congruent with the best available data from population-based, observational studies that evaluated outcomes by intended place of birth and perinatal risk factors. Low-ri sk women in this cohort experienced high rates of physiologic birth and low rates of intervention without an increase in adverse outcomes. J Midwifery Womens Health 2014;59:17-27 c/circlecopyrt2014 by the American College Keywords: birth place, home childbirth, midwife, midwifery, perinatal outcome, pregnancy outcomes INTRODUCTION In the United States, approximately 1% of all births occur in homes and birth centers, and these births are attended pri-marily by direct-entry midwives (DEMs), including certifiedprofessional midwives (CPMs). 1Of the 1.18% of US births oc- curring outside of the hospital in 2010, approximately 66%(31,500) were home births. Although a small proportion oftotal births in the United States, home births are on the rise.After a steady decline between 1990 and 2004, home birthsincreased by 41% between 2004 and 2010, up from 0.56% to0.79%, with 10% of this increase occurring between 2009 and2010. 1By comparison, in Great Britain and the Netherlands 8% and 29% of women, respectively, give birth outside of anobstetric unit. 2,3 Data on outcomes from planned home births in the United States have not been reported in the peer-reviewed lit-erature since 2005, 4when Johnson and Daviss described out- comes for 5418 home births attended by CPMs in 2000. In2004, the Midwives Alliance of North American (MANA) di-vision of research developed a Web-based data collection sys-tem (the MANA Statistics Project [MANA Stats]) for the pur-pose of collecting information on a large, multiyear, voluntarysample of midwife-led births occurring primarily at home and Address correspondence to Melissa Cheyney, PhD, CPM, LDM, Depart- ment of Anthropology, Oregon State Waldo Hall 238, Corval- lis, OR 97331.

BACKGROUND A complete understanding of the safety of planned home andbirth center birth is difficult to achieve. To date, universalperinatal data are only available in the United States throughbirth certificates, which are unreliable with respect to infor-mation on the intended and the actual place of birth. 6-8Until recently, high-quality data comparing outcomes by birth set-ting were not available because many published studies failedto reliably distinguish among intended and actual place ofbirth, type of attendant, and maternal risk profiles. Despiteattempts to design a randomized controlled trial, sufficientnumbers of women have not consented to be randomized ac-cording to birth site. 9 In 2009, 3 well-designed, population-based cohort studies w e r ep u b l i s h e dc o m p a r i n gp l a n n e dh o m eb i r t h st op l a n n e dhospital births with professional midwives as attendants. Inthe first study, de Jonge and colleagues 10used a national dataset (N =529,688) of low-risk pregnancies in the Nether- lands to compare perinatal mortality and morbidity outcomesfor planned home (60.7%) and hospital births (30.8%) be-tween 2000 and 2006. There were no significant differences inintrapartum death, neonatal death within 24 hours or 7 days 1526-9523/09/$36.00 doi:10.1111/jmwh.12172 c/circlecopyrt2014 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives 17 App 1-3This study reports maternal and neonatal outcomes for women planning to give birth at home under midwife-led care, as recorded in the Midwives Alliance of North America Statistics Project dataset (version 2.0, birth years 2004-2009). Among 16,924 women planning a home birth at the onset of labor, 94% had a vaginal birth, and fewer than 5% requiredoxytocin augmentation or epidural analgesia. Eleven percent of women who went into labor intending to give birth at home transferred to the hospital during labor;failure to progress was the primary reason for intrapartum transfer. Nearly 1100 women attempted a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) in this sample, with a total VBAC success rate of 87%. Rates of cesarean, low 5-minute Apgar score (/H11021 7), intact perineum, breastfeeding, and intrapartum and early neonatal mortality for this sample are all consistent with reported outcomes from the best available population-based, observationalstudies of planned home births. after birth, or rates of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)admissions. The second study, a prospective, 5-year (2000-2004) matched cohort study in British Columbia, compared out-comes for low-risk women in a midwife-attended plannedhome birth group (n =2889), a physician-attended hospi- tal birth group (n =5331), and a midwife-attended planned hospital birth group (n =4752). 11In this intention-to-treat analysis, women in the planned home birth group had signifi-cantly fewer intrapartum interventions, including narcotic orepidural analgesia, andassisted well as significantlyfewer adverse outcomes, inclu ding postpartum hemorrhage, and third- or fourth-degree lacerations. No significant differ-ences were found between the home birth group and eithercomparison group with respect to the diagnosis of asphyxia atbirth, seizures, need for assisted ventilation beyond the first24 hours of life, or low 5-minute Apgar scores (/H11021 7).

No differences were found between groups for perinataland neonatal composite outcome measures (2.4% 0.68-1.03).A l lm e a s u r e so fm a t e r n a lm o r b i d i t yw e r el o w e ri nt h ep l a n n e dhome birth group, as were rates for all obstetric interventionsincluding cesarean (5.2% vs 8.1%; RR 0.64; 95% CI, Subsequently, in 2011 the Birthplace in England Collab- orative Group reported findings from a prospective study of64,538 births among low-risk women in England. 2,13Inves- t i g a t o r sc o n c l u d e dt h a tf o rh e a l t h yw o m e n ,a d v e r s em a t e r -nal and newborn outcomes were extremely rare, regardless ofbirth setting. Planned home birth was associated with signif-icantly fewer interventions, higher maternal satisfaction, andincreased cost-effectiveness compared to birth in a hospitalobstetric unit. 13Most recently, Stapleton and colleagues14de- scribed outcomes from births attended by certified nurse-midwives (CNMs), licensed midwives (LMs), and CPMs thatoccurred in birth centers in the United States. These data werecollected through the Uniform Data Set (UDS), a Web-basedtool developed by the American Association of Birth Centers(AABC) for use in member centers. This National Birth Cen-ter Study II reported excellent outcomes and reduced inter-ventions as a result of midwifery-led care in birth centers. Olsen and Clausen, 15in their 2012 Cochrane system- atic review, suggest that while evidence from randomizedcontrolled trials sufficiently powered to assess differencesin perinatal mortality by birth site may never be available,the balance of evidence from large well-designed observa-tional studies supports informed choice of birth place injurisdictions where integrated maternity systems exist. How-ever, some have suggested that these outcomes are not gen-eralizable to the United States because there currently is nointegrated maternity care system with clear communicationbetween birth settings and across provider types. 16,17Rising rates of home and birth center births, in the absence of aunified, national policy on choice and interprofessional col-laboration across birth settings, are a major concern. 18In addition, without established systems for universal maternityc a r ed a t ac o l l e c t i o n ,i ti sd i f f i c u l tt oe v a l u a t et h eq u a l i t ya n dsafety of care across birth settings and by multiple providertypes. The establishment of reliable and inclusive tools for US-based perinatal data collection has become a priority. METHODS Data Collection Data were collected between 2004 and 2009 using the MANA Stats 2.0 Web-based data collection tool, which was devel-oped by the MANA Division of Research in 2004 in accor-dance with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qualityguidelines. 19Participation in the project was voluntary, with an estimated 20% to 30% of active CPMs and a substantiallylower proportion of CNMs contributing. 5Midwife partici- pants obtained written informed consent from all clients at theonset of care, and only data from women who consented wereincluded in the research dataset. More than 95% of women 18 Volume 59, No. 1, January/February 2014 App 1-4consented to be included,5a high rate of participation that has been observed in other studies involving this population.4,14 All analyses presented here were approved by the institutional review board at Oregon State University. The MANA Stats 2.0 online form collected data on nearly 200 variables, including demographic characteristics of par-ticipating women and families; pregnancy history as wellas general health and social intra-partum, neonatal, and postpartum events and were also collectedon antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum maternal andneonatal transfers, as well as on intended and actual place ofbirth. The data collection design for MANA Stats includespreregistration, or prospective logging, of all clients at thestart of care, before outcomes are known. Midwife contrib-utors complete the Web-based form over the course of carethrough the 6-week postpartum visit, or the final visit if ear-lier. Data are stored on a secure server with encryption soft-ware congruent with privacy and security measures for pro-tected health information, as defined by the United StatesDepartment of Health and Human Services. 20,21Upon en- rollment in the project, midwife contributors are providedwith detailed instructions on the use of the online data collec-tion tool; and data collection support team members, knownas data doulas, provide e-mail and phone support to allcontributors. All courses of care reported here were submitted by midwives using the 2.0 form. These records were subjectedto 3 postsubmission review processes, described in detailelsewhere. 5All data forms indicating maternal, fetal, or new- born deaths also underwent detailed case review using a mod-ified fetal-infant mortality review approach. 22,23Analysis of pre- and postreviewed variables during quality testing evi-denced near perfect agreement, suggesting that MANA Stats2.0 data were entered with a high degree of accuracy bymidwives. 5Thus, any errors in the dataset are likely random rather than systematic. For a detailed analysis of the history,methodology, and validity of the MANA Stats 2.0 data collec-tion tool, see Cheyney et al. 5 Inclusion Criteria The complete November 2004 through December 2009MANA Stats 2.0 dataset (N =24,848) includes records from all women receiving at least some prenatal care from contrib-utor midwives. For the purposes of this analysis, we excludedwomen who transferred care to another provider prior to theonset of labor, women who at the onset of labor had a plannedbirth location other than home, and women who did not livein the United States. Thus, our final sample for this analysisc o n s i s t e do fa l lp l a n n e dh o m eb i r t h s( N= 16,924). Data Export and Analysis All data from the 2.0 dataset were exported from the struc-tured query language-based online data collection system asa comma-separated value (*.csv) file and then imported intoSPSS Statistics 24for analysis. Our main analyses, in keeping with the descriptive objective of this study, consisted of calcu-lating basic frequencies, measures of central tendency, mea-sures of variance, and confidence intervals as indicated. Throughout the analyses, we were careful to limit the de- nominators to those women and newborns at risk for the out-come. For instance, for all demographic characteristics, ob-stetric history, and pregnancy complication data, as well asthe intrapartum transfers, the denominator is women whowent into labor intending to give birth at home. For mostperinatal outcomes, the denominator is newborns\u2014removingthose no longer at risk. For instance, the denominator forlow Apgar score (/H11021 7) is liveborn newborns. There are 2 ex- ceptions: neonatal transfers and postpartum transfers are re-ported among the entire sample of neonates/women, as wellas among only those who gave birth at home, thus exclud-ing intrapartum transfers. The second method is technicallycorrect. Mother-newborn dyads transferred during the intra-partum period are not at risk of postpartum or neonatal trans-fer. However, because the reporting of these variables is notconsistent in the literature, 14,25we report both values to allow f o rc o m p a r i s o nw i t ha sm a n yo t h e rs t u d i e sa sp o s s i b l e .I na d -dition, in keeping with standards for reporting results fromobservational studies, 26we have included the actual denomi- nators (ie, the theoretical denominator of women, or livebornnewborns, minus participants missing data for that variable)as well as 95% CIs, as relevant. RESULTS Contributing Midwives Data were contributed by 432 different midwives, including CPMs/LMs/LDMs, CNMs/CMs, naturopathic midwives, un-licensed direct-entry midwives, and others (Table 1). The ma- jority of births in the sample were attended by CPMs (79.2%). Demographic Characteristics The final sample included 16,924 women and 16,984 new-borns (Figure 1). Complete demographic characteristics for the sample are reported in Table 2.B r i e f l y ,m o s tw o m e ni nt h i s sample were white, college-educated, and married. Of note,greater than 6% of the sample was identified by their midwifeas Amish or Mennonite. Although midwives in all states areeligible to contribute data to MANA Stats, the 2.0 home birthcohort comes disproportionately from the Western UnitedStates. Almost two-thirds of the women in this sample paidfor midwifery care out-of-pocket, either because their insur-ance did not cover home birth, their midwife did not provideinsurance billing, or because they were uninsured.

Twenty-two percent of the sample was nulliparous, and 9.2%of multiparous women were grand multiparas ( 5p r e v i o u s births after 20 weeks' gestation). Of the parous women, 8.0%had a history of previous cesarean. Most women began theirpregnancies with a normal (18.5-25 kg/m 2)b o d ym a s si n d e x (BMI).

Of the 168 women with GDM, preeclampsia,eclampsia, or Rh sensitization, 74 had at least one prenatal visitwith an obstetrician, and 47 had at least 3 prenatal visits withan obstetrician (an additional 33 women did not have data onobstetrician visits).

Of the 915 successful VBACs, 94% were completed at home. A total of222 newborns in a breech presentation were born vaginally(57.2%) or by cesarean (42.8%) (Table 3). Of the 127 breech neonates born vaginally, 92% were born at home. Gestational Age and Birth Weight Ninety-two percent of newborns were full-term, 2.5% werepreterm, and 5.1% were postterm based on the midwife's clin-ical gestational age assessment following birth.

Neonatal Transfers Neonatal transfer occurred for 0.9% (149/16,984) of all new-borns whose mothers went into labor intending to give birthat home and occurred for 1.0% (149/15,134) of the newbornsborn at home. The majority of these 149 newborn transferswere for respiratory distress and/or Apgar scores below 7 (n=116, 77.9%); an additional 9 newborns (6.0%) were trans- ferred for evaluation of congenital anomalies. Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Of the 16,039 women who gave birth vaginally, 49.2% did lacer-ations or skin splits that did not require suturing occurred in12.8% of the women, and 4.8% had more substantial labial lac-erations that required suturing.

Of the women who lost greater than 500 mL of blood 22 Volume 59, No. 1, January/February 2014 App 1-8after a vaginal birth, 51.4% were given oxytocin (n =797), methergine (n =132), or both (n =317) to control bleeding. There was one pregnancy-related maternal death in the sample. This multiparous mother had no antenatal or intra- partum risk factors. The newborn was born vaginally at homewith Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 5 and 10 minutes, respectively,and the postpartum course for mother and newborn was nor-mal through the first 3 postpartum days. Death occurred att h em o t h e r ' sh o m eo nt h et h i r dd a yp o s t p a r t u mi nt h ea f t e r -noon, following a morning visit by the midwife during whichall vital signs had been normal. A blood clot was found in themother's heart during autopsy; the death was attributed to thepregnancy by the medical examiner. Fetal and Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality For all newborns in the sample (including those with congen-ital anomalies and regardless of actual location of birth), 1.5%(n=245) had 5-minute Apgar scores below 7, and 0.6% (n = 97) had Apgar scores below 4. Of the 1850 newborns born inthe hospital following an intrapartum transfer, 3.7% (n =69) had a 5-minute Apgar score below 7. During the first 6 weekspostpartum, 479 (2.8%) newborns were admitted to the NICU(Tables 3and4). The rate of intrapartum fetal death (occurring after the onset of labor, but prior to birth) was 1.30 per 1000. The rateof early neonatal death (death occurring after a live birth, butbefore 7 completed days of life) was 0.88 per 1000; and therate of late neonatal death (death occurring at 7 to 27 com-pleted days of life) was 0.41 per 1000. When lethal congenitala n o m a l y - r e l a t e dd e a t h sw e r ee x c l u d e d( n= 0i n t r a p a r t u m ,n =8e a r l yn e o n a t a l ,n= 1l a t en e o n a t a l ) ,t h er a t e so fi n t r a - partum death, early neonatal death, and late neonatal deathwere 1.30 per 1000 (n =22), 0.41 per 1000 (n =7), and 0.35 per 1000 (n =6), respectively (Table 5). Of the 22 fetuses who died after the onset of labor but prior to birth, 2 were attributed to intrauterine infections, 2 wereattributed to placental abruption, 3 were attributed to cordaccidents, 2 were attributed to complications from maternalGDM, one was attributed to meconium aspiration, one wasattributed secondary to shoulder dystocia, one was attributedto preeclampsia-related complications, and one was attributedto autopsy-confirmed liver rupture and hypoxia. The causes ofthe remaining 9 intrapartum deaths were unknown. For the 7newborns who died during the early neonatal period, 2 weresecondary to cord accidents during birth (one with shoulderdystocia), and the remaining 5 were attributed to hypoxia orischemia of unknown origin. Of the 6 newborns that died inthe late neonatal period, 2 were secondary to cord accidentsduring birth, and the causes of the remaining 4 deaths wereunknown. When examining perinatal death rates among higher-risk women, the data suggest that compared to neonates born invertex presentation, neonates born in breech presentationswere at increased risk of intrapartum death (1.09/1000 breech, 0.08). In this sample, primiparous women were at increasedrisk of having an intrapartum fetal death compared to mul-tiparous women (2.92/1000 primiparous vs 0.84/1000 multi-parous,P/H110210.01). Newborns born to primiparas were not, however, at increased risk of either early or late neonatald e a t h .T h es a m ep a t t e r nw a ss e e nf o rm u l t i p a r o u sw o m e nwith a history of cesarean undergoing a trial of labor af-t e rc e s a r e a n( T O L A C ) :a ni n c r e a s e dr i s ko fi n t r a p a r t u mf e t a ldeath, when compared to multiparous women with no priorcesarean (2.85/1000 vs 0.66/1000 multiparas with-out a history of cesarean, P=0.05; Table 5), but no increase in neonatal death. There was no evidence of increased riskof death among multiple births. When higher-risk women(those with multiple gestations, breech presentation, TOLAC,GDM, or preeclampsia) were removed from the sample, theintrapartum death rate was 0.85 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.39-1.31). Breastfeeding At 6 weeks postpartum, 97.7% (n =16,338) of newborns were at least partially breastfed. Only 0.4% (n =70) were never breastfed, and 86.0% (n =14,344) were exclusively breastfed through at least 6 weeks postpartum. DISCUSSION In this large national sample of midwife-led, planned homebirths in the United States, the majority of women andnewborns experienced excellent outcomes and very lowrates of intervention relative to other national datasets ofUS women. 27-29Rates of spontaneous vaginal birth, ce- Apgar score ( intrapartum and early neonatal mortal-ity are all consistent with reported outcomes from the bestavailable population-based observational studies of plannedhome and birth center births. 2,10-12,14,30Rates of success- ful VBAC are higher than reported elsewhere (87% vs 60-80%), 31-33with no significant increase in early or over- all neonatal mortality. There is some evidence of increasedintrapartum fetal death associated with TOLAC; however,the total number of events was too low for reliable anal-ysis. Only 4.5% of the total MANA Stats sample requiredoxytocin augmentation and/or epidural analgesia, which isnotably lower than rates of these interventions reported morebroadly in the United States (26% for oxytocin augmentationand 67% for epidural analgesia). 27Rates of operative vaginal birth and cesarean are also substantially lower than those re-ported for hospital-based US samples (1.2% vs 3.5% and 5.2%vs 32.8%, respectively). 27,29,34Such reduced rates of obstet- ric procedures and interventions may result in significant costsavings and increased health benefits for low-risk women whogive birth outside of the hospital. 13,35In addition, fewer than 5% of the newborns born in the hospital after an intrapartumtransfer had a 5-minute Apgar score below 7, and 2.1% had ascore below 4, indicating relatively low morbidity even amongthe transferred subsample. These findings are consistent withoutcomes reported in the National Birth Center Study II. 14 T h er e p o r t e dr a t eo fp o s t p a r t u mh e m o r r h a g e( /H11022500 mL f o rv a g i n a lb i r t h s )i sh i g h e ri nt h i ss a m p l er e l a t i v et ot h erates reported by others (15.4% vs 1.4%-3.7%). 36-38How- ever, hemorrhage re-ceived an antihemorrhagic agent.

It is difficult to compare birth-related mortality statistics across studies; there are so few death outcomes that statis-tical power is quite low. This is not unexpected: The intra-partum, maternal, and neonatal death rates in high-resourcecountries are remarkably low overall. The lack of power is fur-ther compounded in studies of planned home and birth cen-ter births because cohorts from these birth locations are com-monly comprised of relatively low-risk women, thus fewerdeaths are expected. Furthermore, when examining the homea n db i r t hc e n t e rb i r t hl i t e r a t u r et od a t e ,t h e r ei sl i t t l ec o n s i s -t e n c yi nt h ew a yt h a tm o r t a l i t yd a t aa r ed e f i n e da n dr e p o r t e d ,and few authors provide confidence intervals or sufficient rawdata to allow for comparison. Nonetheless, it is useful to com-pare death rates associated with planned home and birth cen-ter births, as reported across a variety of geographic settings(although confidence intervals around the rates are large) be-cause any potential differences observed can serve to generatehypotheses for future work. The intrapartum fetal death rate among women plan- ning a home birth in our sample was 1.3 per 1000 (95% CI,0.75-1.84). This observed rate and CI are statistically congru-ent with rates reported by Johnson and Daviss 4and Kennare et al30but are higher than the intrapartum death rates re- ported by de Jonge et al,10Hutton et al,12and Stapleton et al.14 While the absolute risk44is still quite low, the relatively ele- vated intrapartum mortality rate in our sample may be par-t i a l l yaf u n c t i o no ft h eh i g h e rr i s kp r o f i l eo ft h eM A N AS t a t ssample relative to de Jonge et al, 10Hutton et al,12and contain primarily low-risk, sin- gleton, vertex births. When women who are at higher riskfor adverse outcomes (ie, women with multiple gestations,breech presentation, TOLAC, GDM, or preeclampsia) are re-moved 1000; 95% CI, 0.39-1.31) is statistically congruent withrates reported by Hutton et al 12and Stapleton et al,14al- though still higher than that reported by de Jonge et al.10 It is also possible that the unique health care system foundin the United States\u2014and particularly the lack of integra-tion across birth settings, combined with elevated rates ofobstetric intervention\u2014contributes to intrapartum mortal-ity due to delays in timely transfer related to fear of reprisaland/or because some women with higher-risk pregnanciess t i l lc h o o s eh o m eb i r t hb e c a u s et h e r ea r ef e w e ro p t i o n st h a tsupport normal physiologic birth available in their localhospitals. 18,30,45-48The early neonatal death rate in our home birth sample was 0.41 per 1000, which is statistically congruent with ratesreported by de Jonge et al 10and the Birthplace in England Collaborative Group.2Our combined early and late neonatal death rates, or total neonatal death rate, of 0.77 per 1000 is sta-tistically congruent with the rate reported by Hutton et al. 12 Other studies of planned home or planned birth center birtheither define neonatal mortality differently or do not define itat all, making comparisons difficult. In addition, some of theintrapartum fetal deaths, as well as some additional neona-tal deaths, reported in MANA Stats may have been congeni-tal anomaly-related. There were several incidences when themidwife or receiving physician suspected congenital defectbased on visual assessment, but an autopsy or other testingwas declined and no official cause of death was assigned. Then u m b e ro fu n k n o w nc a u s e so fd e a t hi no u rs a m p l ei sa l s oa tleast partially attributable to parents declining autopsies 49;o f the 35 intrapartum and neonatal deaths not attributed to con-genital anomaly, only 6 received an autopsy. Collectively, our findings are consistent with the body of literature that shows that for healthy, low-risk women, ap l a n n e dh o m eb i r t ha t t e n d e db yam i d w i f ec a nr e s u l ti np o s -itive outcomes and benefits for both mother and newborn.H o w e v e r ,t h es a f e t yo fh o m eb i r t hf o rh i g h e r - r i s kp r e g n a n -cies, particularly with regard to breech presentation (5 fe-tal/neonatal deaths in 222 breech presentations), TOLAC (5out of 1052), multiple gestation (one out of 120), and ma-ternal pregnancy-induced comorbidities (GDM: 2 out of 131;preeclampsia: one out of 28) requires closer examination be-c a u s et h es m a l ln u m b e ro fe v e n t si na n yo n es u b g r o u pl i m i t e dthe effective sample size to the point that multivariable anal-yses to explore these associations further were not possible.It is unclear whether the increased mortality associated withhigher-risk women who plan home births is causally linked tobirth setting or is simply consistent with the expected increasein rates of adverse outcomes associated with these complica-tions. Limitations T h em a i nl i m i t a t i o no ft h i ss t u d yi st h a tt h es a m p l ei sn o tpopulation-based. There is currently no mandatory, reliabledata collection system designed to capture and describe out-comes for all planned home births in the United States. We arealso unable, for a number of reasons detailed elsewhere, 5to quantify precisely what proportion of practicing midwives ofvarious credentials contributed data to MANA Stats between2004 and 2009. In addition, the data entered into the MANAStats system come from medical records. Because medicalrecords are kept primarily for patient care purposes with sec-ondary uses for billing, research, and legal documentation, re-searchers using data derived from medical records must becognizant of these limitations. 50-53However, we expect that the outcomes reported here were likely to be recorded in them e d i c a lr e c o r dw i t har e a s o n a b l yh i g hd e g r e eo fa c c u r a c yb e -cause of their importance to clinical care. Furthermore, ourpre-/postdata review analysis indicated that data were ini-tially entered with a high degree of accuracy. 5Finally, we can- not confirm with 100% certainty that participating midwivesentered data from all of their clients. However, because the Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health rwww.jmwh.org 25 App 1-11MANA Stats system requires that clients be logged early in prenatal care, any such exclusions would have occurred priorto the outcome of the birth being known. 5 CONCLUSION Descriptive data from the first 6 years (2004-2009) of theMANA Statistics Project demonstrate that for this large, na-tional cohort of women who planned home births under thecare of a midwife, perinatal outcomes are congruent with thebest available data from population-based observational stud-ies that have evaluated outcomes by intended place of birthand by pregnancy risk profiles. Low-risk women in this sam-p l ee x p e r i e n c e dh i g hr a t e so fn o r m a lp h y s i o l o g i cb i r t ha n dvery low rates of operative birth and interventions, with noconcomitant increase in adverse events. Conclusions are lessclear for higher-risk women. Given the low absolute num-b e ro fe v e n t sa n dt h el a c ko fam a t c h e dc o m p a r i s o ng r o u p ,we were unable to discern whether poorer outcomes amonghigher-risk women were associated with place of birth or re-lated to risks inherent to their conditions. Prospective cohort studies with matched comparison groups that utilize the large datasets collected by MANA Statsand AABC's UDS have the potential to address critical gapsin our understanding of birth settings and providers in theUnited States. We recommend that future research focus on3 critical questions: 1) What place of birth is most likely tolead to optimal maternal and newborn health, given specificrisk profiles and regionally available birth options? 2) Whatare the characteristics of midwife-led care that contribute tosafe physiologic birth? and 3) Regardless of where a womanchooses to give birth, how can clinicians most effectively col-laborate across birth settings and provider types to achieve thebest possible outcomes for women and newborns?

Journal of Midwifery & Women's /20 /20 with the MANA Standards and Quali cations for the Art and Practice of Midwifery and the MANA Statement of Values and Ethics, and demonstrates the clinical skills and judgments described in the MANA Core Competencies for Midwifery Practice. 1. Skills\u2014Necessary skills of a practicing midwife include the ability to: Provide continuity of care to the woman and her newborn during the maternity cycle. Care may continue throughout the woman's entire life cycle. The midwife recognizes that childbearing is a woman's experience and encourages the active involvement of Identify, assess and provide care during the antepartal, intrapartal, postpartal, and newborn periods. She may also provide well woman and newborn care review and practice Deal with emergency situations appropriately Use judgment, skill and intuition in competent assessment and response 2. Appropriate equipment and treatment \u2014Midwives carry and maintain equipment to assess and provide care for the well-woman, the mother, the fetus, and the newborn; to maintain clean and/or aseptic technique; and to treat conditions including, but not limited to, Standards and Qualifications for the Art and Practice of Midwifery Revised at the Midwives Alliance Business Meeting October 2, 2005 hemorrhage, lacerations, and cardio-respiratory distress. This may include the use of non-pharmaceutical agents, pharmaceutical agents, and equipment for suturing and intravenous therapy. 3. Records\u2014Midwives keep accurate records of care for each woman and newborn in their practice. Records shall be held confidential Eexcept as legally requiredFK Records shall be provided to the woman on request. The communications regarding women in her care. 4. Data Collection\u2014It is highly recommended that midwives collect data for their practice on a regular basis and that this be done prospectively, following the protocol developed by the MANA Division of Research. Data collected by the midwife shall be used to inform and improve her practice. 5. Compliance\u2014Midwives will inform and assist parents regarding public health requirements of the jurisdiction in which the midwifery service is provided. 6. Medical Consultation, Collaboration, and Referral \u2014All midwives recognize that there are certain conditions for which medical consultations are advisable. The midwife shall make a reasonable attempt to assure that her client has access to consultation, collaboration, and/or referral to a medical care system when indicated. App 2-4Midwives Alliance 1500 Sunday Drive, Suite 102Raleigh, NC 27607 888.923.6262 www.mana.orginfo@mana.org 7. Screening \u2014Midwives respect the woman's right to self-determination. Midwives assess and inform each woman regarding her health and well-being relevant to the appropriateness of midwifery services. It is the right and responsibility of the midwife to refuse or discontinue services in certain circumstances. Appropriate referrals are made in the interest of the mother or baby's well-being or when the required or requested care is outside the midwife's personal scope of practice as described in her practice guidelines. 8. Informed Choice \u2014Each midwife will present accurate information about herself and her services, including but not limited to: Her education in midwifery Her experience level in midwifery Her practice guidelines eer financial charges for services The services she does and does not provide Her expectations of the pregnant woman and the The midwife recognizes that the woman is the primary decision maker in all matters regarding her own health care and that of her infant. The midwife respects the woman's right to decline treat- ments or procedures and properly documents these choices. The midwife clearly states and documents when a woman's choices fall outside the midwife's practice guidelines. 9. Continuing Education \u2014Midwives will update their knowledge and skills on a regular basis. 10. Peer Review\u2014Midwifery practice includes an on-going process of case review with peers 11. Practice Guidelines\u2014Each midwife will develop practice guidelines for her services that are in agreement with Practice of Midwifery, the MANA Statement of Values and Ethics, and the MANA Core Competencies for Midwifery Practice, in keeping with her level of expertise. 12. Expanded scope of practice\u2014The midwife may expand her scope of practice beyond the MANA Core Competencies to incorporate new procedures that improve care for women and babies consistent with the midwifery model of careK eer practice must reflect knowledge of the new procedureI including risksI benefitsI screening criteriaI and identification and management of potential complications.

An entry-level mid-wife is qualified to practice midwifery autonomouslyK The Competencies inform practicing midwives, student midwives, midwifery education programs, consumers, accreditation and certi- cation agencies, state and federal legislators, licensing authorities, health policy makers and other health care professionals concern-ing the practice of midwifery. Individual midwives are responsible to the licensing authority and regulations of the jurisdiction within which they practice. Midwives provide care to parturient women and their newborn babies in a variety of settings in accordance with the Midwives Model of Care, which is based on the principle that pregnancy and birth are normal life processes.Core Competencies for Basic Midwifery Practice Adopted by the Midwives Alliance Board October 3, 1994 Revisions by committee, adopted by the Midwives Alliance Board August 4, 2011 The Midwives Model of Care includes: monitoring the physical, psychological and social well-being of the mother throughout the childbearing cycle; providing the mother with individualized education, counsel- ing and prenatal care; continuous hands-on assistance during labor and delivery; and postpartum support;minimizing technological interventions; identifying and referring require obstetrical at- tention.

Note: The MANA Core Competencies were written during the early developmental phase of the Midwives Alliance of North America. The Board of Directors approved them in 1984. They were adopted by both NARM and MEAC as the education content for programs for CPMs Two years ago a task force was assembled to update and revise the original Core Competencies with representatives from MANA, NARM, MEAC, NACPM, and individuals who had been authors on the original document This resulted in a very thorough and intensive collaboration to update, revise, and invigorate this very important core document Thanks to the determination and passion of these partners and the skillful task force leadership of Pam Dyer Stewart and Justine Clegg, the revised Core Competencies for the Practice of Basic Midwifery were completed in Spring 2011 and approved by the MANA Board in July 2011 We present this incredible and inclusive document with pride and celebration of what it means to be a midwife App 2-12Midwives Alliance Core Competencies Page 2 of 5 Revised August 2011 www.mana.org The scope of midwifery practice may be expanded beyond the Core Competencies outlined in this document to incorporate ad-ditional skills and procedures that improve care for women and their families. The midwife provides care according to the following guiding principles of practice: Pregnancy and childbearing are natural physiologic life pro- cesses. Women have within themselves the innate biological wisdom to give birth.Physical, emotional, psychosocial and spiritual factors syn- ergistically shape the health of individuals and affect the childbearing process.The childbearing experience and birth of a baby are personal, family and community events.The woman is the only direct care provider for herself and her unborn baby; thus the most important determinant of a healthy pregnancy is the mother herself.The parameters of \"normal\" vary widely, and each pregnancy, birth and baby is unique. In consideration thereof: Midwives work in partnership with women and their chosen support community throughout the caregiving relationship.Midwives respect and support the dignity, rights and respon- sibilities of the women they serve.Midwives are committed to addressing disparities in maternal and child health care status and outcomes.Midwives work as autonomous practitioners, although they collaborate with other health care and social service providers when necessary.Midwives work to optimize the well-being of mothers and their developing babies as the foundation of caregiving.Midwives recognize the empowerment inherent in the child- bearing experience and strive to support women to make informed decisions and take responsibility for their own and their baby's well-being.Midwives integrate clinical or hands-on evaluation, theoreti- cal knowledge, intuitive assessment, spiritual awareness and informed consent and refusal as essential components of ef-fective decision making.Midwives strive to ensure optimal birth for each woman and baby and provide guidance, education and support to facili-tate the spontaneous processes of pregnancy, labor and birth, lactation and mother-baby attachment, using appropriate intervention as needed.Midwives value continuity of care throughout the childbearing cycle and strive to maintain such continuity.Midwives are committed to sharing their knowledge and ex- perience through such avenues as peer review, preceptorship, mentoring and participation in MANA's statistics collection program. MANA Core Competencies Academic knowledge provides the theoretical foundation for un-derstanding the scope of health during the childbearing year in order to distinguish deviations from healthy functioning. Clinical skills refer to the hands-on assessment of the woman's physical health, observation of her psychosocial well-being and skilled listening. The midwife views health holistically, uses critical thinking to evaluate clinical applies intuition as authori-tative knowledge, maintains an integrated understanding of the whole picture and, with the woman, identifies and creates a plan of care based on conscious analysis of challenges and goals.

UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP): The rights of Indigenous People to practice their cultural traditions and choose their own caregivers is protected by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Adopted by the General Assembly 61/295 in September 2007. As written, Act 32 violates these rights. UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) Article 8 1. Indigenous peoples and individuals have the right not to be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of their culture. 2. States shall provide effective mechanisms for prevention of, and redress for: (a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities; (b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources; (c) Any form of forced population transfer which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights; (d) Any form of forced assimilation or integration; (e) Any form of propaganda designed to promote or incite racial or ethnic discrimination directed against them. Article 22 1. Particular attention shall be paid to the rights and special needs of indigenous elders, women, youth, children and persons with disabilities in the implementation of this Declaration. 2. States shall take measures, in conjunction with indigenous peoples, to ensure that indigenous women and children enjoy the full protection and guarantees against all forms of violence and discrimination.Appendix 3 - Traditional Cultural Midwife App 3-1Article 23 Indigenous peoples have the right to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to development. In particular, indigenous peoples have the right to be actively involved in developing and determining health, housing and other economic and social programmes affecting them and, as far as possible, to administer such programmes through their own institutions. Article 24 1. Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and to maintain their health practices, including the conservation of their vital medicinal plants, animals and minerals. Indigenous individuals also have the right to access, without any discrimination, to all social and health services. 2. Indigenous individuals have an equal right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. States shall take the necessary steps with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of this right. https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf Traditional Cultural Midwives should be exempt from licensure because: 1.The pathway to licensure under Act 32 is based upon a set of values, beliefs and practices which come from the dominant western culture which has colonized them. Article 8 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) states that they are specifically protected from forced assimilation . Act 32 forces indigenous midwives to assimilate in order to get licensed. 2.In addition, Article 8 provides protection from destruction of culture . Requiring Indigenous Traditional midwives to attain licensure forces them to learn, practice and perpetuate the culture of western midwifery instead of the midwifery of their people. This leads to a loss of traditional knowledge and skills which is destruction of culture . History shows that a widespread lapse of practice quickly leads to ancient knowledge slipping into obscurity. \"Research shows that a strong determinant of a community's overall health is their ability to be self-determined and to reclaim and practice their cultural ways. Indigenous midwifery is crucial to this reclamation. It is the right of Indigenous midwives and communities to reclaim birth.\" App 3-2 \"Na Pua O Haumea\" is the advisory council which provides guidance and accountability for traditional cultural midwives as well as the communities they serve. They support and promote the perpetuation of traditional childbirth practices in those communities while overseeing accountability for those who practice under the Traditional Cultural Midwives exemption. Na Pua O Haumea uses the criteria in the diagram below to verify claims to indigeneity: Upon request from Na Pua O Haumea, Traditional Cultural Midwives are expected to provide the following in order to substantiate their claim to indigeneity: App 3-3Lineage: Documentation demonstrating that the individual's practice of midwifery has been directly received through a spiritual and/or cultural lineage Resume/biography of relevant experience and training in spiritual/cultural practices. Ten notarized letters from members of the community they serve, attesting to the individual's service to the community. Seven of these should be directly from families that the individual has served under the direct supervision of an exempt midwife preceptor; three of these letters can come from organizations or community members who are familiar with the services provided to the community by the individual. Na Pua O Haumea consists of seven volunteer members who have been selected for their cultural and midwifery knowledge as well as their respect in the community. They work in conjunction with indigenous and cultural midwives from Alaska, Canada and The United States to protect the integrity of Traditional Cultural Midwifery in Hawaii. National Aboriginal Council of Midwives (NACM) Position Statement on Evacuation for Birth The National Aboriginal Council of Midwives (NACM) strongly condemns the routine and blanket evacuation of pregnant people for birth and demands the return of birthing services to all Indigenous communities. It is unacceptable that people must leave their communities and travel to large and usually southern centres to access maternity care services.1 NACM strongly advocates for the return of birth to all Indigenous, remote, and rural communities in Canada. It is vital that Indigenous Peoples are surrounded with all the love and support possible, which includes their families, community members, and the land.2 Giving birth in community is safe; communities under the care of a community midwifery program with careful risk screening can have better health outcomes than communities which have a blanket evacuation policy.3 NACM recognizes that some people will need to leave their community to give birth. However, the routine and blanket evacuation for all births is one factor that contributes to poorer birth outcomes for Indigenous Peoples. Evacuation for birth exposes Indigenous Peoples to the App 3-4systemic bias, racism, and trauma that is part of Canadian health care systems and continues the trauma of colonization.4,5,6 NACM affirms that Indigenous Peoples have an inherent right to birth in our communities and on the land. As Indigenous midwives, it is our right and responsibility to revitalize Indigenous birth ceremonies, knowledges, and languages to counter Canada's colonial path of purposeful and aggressive erasure of our Peoples. We actively assert our inherent rights as Indigenous Peoples and as Indigenous midwives. NACM strongly asserts Indigenous midwives are key to the restoration of community birth. We are visibly present and engaged in health care systems across the country and provide clinically excellent care to our community members. We advocate for reproductive care that builds strong Indigenous families and communities and develops relationality. We work towards respectful, inclusive, and reciprocal relationships with Indigenous families, Indigenous care providers, and other health care providers so that Indigenous Peoples, families, and communities can achieve optimum health and wellness. RECOMMENDATIONS 1.NACM calls for the immediate return of reproductive care and birth to Indigenous lands and communities as quickly and safely as possible. Having a trained and qualified professional provide reproductive care in the community creates better health outcomes. 2.NACM calls on all levels of government, health care organizations, and educational institutions to engage and provide equitable funds to Indigenous midwives. Increasing the number of Indigenous midwives and midwifery-led practices will bring birth back to as many communities as possible. 3.NACM calls on all Midwifery Education Programs (MEP) to establish and recognize Indigenous core competencies for Indigenous students and educators for the development of community-based education programs for Indigenous midwives. 4.NACM calls on national, provincial, and territorial midwifery associations and colleges to continue their support of expanding Indigenous midwifery in their jurisdictions. 5.NACM recognizes that some people will need to leave their community to give birth and that, with optimal support, communities will self-determine their individual needs and readiness. In the interim period of restoration of community birthing services, NACM supports Indigenous midwives who engage with medical referral centres and advocates for the recognition of barriers to equitable health services and systemic changes needed to achieve optimum health and wellness. App 3-5NACM calls for immediate actions to create the following conditions for evacuated families: Establish and maintain communication links between caregivers in the home community and referral centre; Create linkages to a complete range of support services in the referral centres including legal, financial, spiritual, informational and system navigation, advocacy, education, and counselling; Establish medical housing facilities in the referral centres that are safe, comfortable, culturally reflective, and can accommodate family needs. Complete support services must be accessible at or through the housing facility in a variety of Indigenous languages; Provide an assigned companion in the referral centres available to each person and family to provide information and emotional and physical support during the period of transition to parenthood. An ideal companion is an Indigenous doula; Provide financial support for hardship incurred by travelling for birth, such as childcare expenses, family visitation in cases of extended absence, and escort costs, including employment compensation, meals, transportation, and communication costs. Breastfeeding babies and young children or children with special needs must have funded accommodation and travel; Maintain the client as an active participant in planning for place of birth, primary caregiver, and travel arrangements. This includes scheduling travel according to individual postpartum needs and adjustments, such as prioritizing the establishment and support of breastfeeding and Ensure the referral centre staff who care for evacuated parents and families are trained in cultural safety, evacuation procedures, and know the services available to evacuated clients and their families.

Statement of Ethics Our values inform and inspire midwifery practice in our hearts and minds. Acting ethically is an expression of our values within the context of our individual, geographic, religious, cultural, ethnic, political, educational and personal backgrounds and in our relationships with others. As we seek to respond in the moment to each situation we face, we call upon ethical principles of human interaction as follows: Beneficence\u2014to act so as to benefit others Nonmaleficence\u2014to avoid causing harm Confidentiality\u2014to honor others' privacy and keep personal interactions confidential Justice\u2014to treat people respectfully and equitably Autonomy\u2014to respect an individual's rights to self-determination and freedom to make decisions that affect his or her life. The equality and mutuality of the relationship between midwife and client create a foundation uniquely suited to integrate these principles. As midwives, we seek to benefit women and babies in our care. Mutual trust and respect are critical to the success of a relationship that requires joint decision making at every level. Moral integrity, truthfulness and adequate information enable all participants to judge together the best course of action in varied situations. Judgments are fundamentally based on awareness and understanding of ourselves and others. They grow out of our own sense of moral integrity, which is born within the heart of each individual. Becoming self-aware and increasing understanding are ongoing processes that must be nurtured as a function of personal and professional growth. MANA's affirmation of individual moral integrity and recognition of the complexity of life events bring us to an understanding that there cannot possibly be one right answer for all situations. Since the outcome of pregnancy is ultimately unknown and is always unknowable, it is inevitable that in certain circumstances our best decisions in the moment will lead to consequences we could not foresee. We recognize the limitations of traditional codes of ethics that present a list of rules to be followed. Therefore, a midwife must develop a moral compass to guide practice in diverse situations that arise from the uniqueness of pregnancy and birth as well as the relationship between midwives and birthing women. This approach affirms the mystery and potential for transformation present in every experience and fosters truly diverse practice. Midwifery care is woman-led care with informed choice and a clear set of values at its core. Decision making is a shared responsibility with the goals of healthy women and babies and of gentle, empowering App 3-13births with a focus on individual and family needs and concerns. Ultimately, it is at the heart of midwifery practice to honor and respect the decisions women make about their pregnancies and births based on their knowledge and belief about what is best for themselves and their babies. There are both individual and social implications to any decision-making process. Our decisions may be impacted by the oppressive rules and practices of a society that is often hostile to homebirth, midwives and midwifery clients. Our actual choices may be limited by the medical, legal, political, economic, cultural or social climate in which we function. The more our values conflict with those of the dominant culture, the greater the threat to the integrity of our own values, and the greater the risk that our actions may lead to professional repercussions or legal reprisal. In such conditions we may be unable to make peace with any course of action or may feel conflicted about a choice already made. The community of women, both midwives and those we serve, may provide a fruitful resource for continued moral support and guidance. In summary, acting ethically requires us to define our values, respond to the communities of families, midwives and cultures in which we find ourselves, act in accord with our values to the best of our ability as the situation demands, and engage in ongoing self-examination, evaluation, peer review and professional growth. By carefully describing the multifaceted aspects of what we value and defining the elements of moral integrity and decision making, we have created a framework for ethical behavior in midwifery practice. We welcome an open and ongoing articulation of values and ethics and the evolution of this document. Midwives Model of Care Is Woman-Centered The Midwives Model of Care is a fundamentally different approach to pregnancy and childbirth than contemporary obstetrics. Midwifery care is uniquely nurturing, hands-on care before, during, and after birth. Midwives are health care professionals specializing in pregnancy and childbirth who develop a trusting relationship with their clients, which results in confident, supported labor and birth. While there are different types of midwives practicing in various settings, all midwives are trained to provide comprehensive prenatal care and education, guide labor and birth, address complications, and care for newborns. The Midwives Model of Care is based on the fact that pregnancy and birth are normal life events. The Midwives Model of Care includes: monitoring the physical, psychological and social well-being of the mother throughout the childbearing cycle providing the mother with individualized education, counseling, and prenatal care, continuous hands-on assistance during labor and delivery, and postpartum support minimizing technological interventions and identifying and referring women who require obstetrical attention. The application of this model has been proven to reduce to incidence of birth injury, trauma, and cesarean section.

Van Wagner V 1, Osepchook C . Education Program, University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Abstract BACKGROUND: The Inuulitsivik midwifery service is a community-based, Inuit-led initiative serving the Hudson coast of the Nunavik region of northern Qu\u00e9bec. This study of outcomes for the Inuulitsivik birth centers, aims to improve understanding of maternity services in remote communities. METHODS: We used a retrospective review of perinatal outcome data collected at each birth at the Inuulitsivik birth centers to examine outcomes for 1,372 labors and 1,382 babies from 2000 to 2007. Data were incomplete for some indicators, particularly for transfers to Montreal. RESULTS: Findings revealed low rates of intervention with safe outcomes in this young, largely multiparous \"all risk\" Inuit population. Ninety-seven percent of births were documented as spontaneous vaginal deliveries, and 85 percent of births were attended by midwives. Eighty-six percent of the labors occurred in Nunavik, whereas 13.7 percent occurred outside Nunavik. The preterm birth rate was found to be 10.6 percent. Postpartum hemorrhage was documented in 15.4 percent of women; of these cases, 6.9 percent had blood loss greater than 1,000 mL. Four fetal deaths (2.9 per 1,000) and five neonatal deaths (< 3.6 per 1,000) were documented. Nine percent (9%) of births involved urgent transfers of mother or baby. The most common reasons for medical evacuation were preterm labor and preeclampsia, and preterm birth was the most common reason for urgent neonatal transfer. App 3-15CONCLUSIONS: The success of the Innulitsivik midwifery service rests on the knowledge and skills of the Inuit midwives, and support of an interprofessional health team. Our study points to the potential for safe, culturally competent local care in remote communities without cesarean section capacity. Our findings support recommendations for integration of midwifery services and Aboriginal midwifery education programs in remote communities. Reclaiming Birth, Health, and Community: Midwifery in the Inuit Villages of Nunavik, Canada VickiVan WagnerRMBrendaEpooJulieNastapokaEvelynHarneyBA, SM Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health Volume 52, Issue 4, July-August 2007, Pages 384-391 This article describes the Inuulitsivik midwifery service and education program, an internationally recognized approach to returning childbirth to the remote Hudson coast communities of Nunavik, the Inuit region of Quebec, Canada. The service is seen as a model of community-based education of Aboriginal midwives, integrating both traditional and modern approaches to care and education. Developed in response to criticisms of the policy of evacuating women from the region in order to give birth in hospitals in southern Canada, the midwifery service is integrally linked to community development, cultural revival, and healing from the impacts of colonization. The midwifery-led collaborative model of care involves effective teamwork between midwives, physicians, and nurses working in the remote villages and at the regional and tertiary referral centers. Evaluative research has shown improved outcomes for this approach to returning birth to remote communities, and this article reports on recent data. Despite regional recognition and wide acknowledgement of their success in developing and sustaining a model for remote maternity care and aboriginal education for the past 20 years, the Nunavik midwives have not achieved formal recognition of their graduates under the Quebec Midwifery Act. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526952307001122?via%3Dihub While the modern medical system may be working for the most privileged portion of our population it is not working for the indigenous, impoverished and disenfranchised. Native Hawaiian infant mortality rates are 22.81% higher than the statewide average and more than double that of caucasian infant mortality rates. African American and Filipino infant mortality rates are even higher than those of Hawaiians.

Instead the system has developed a modern understanding of this term based on the following: Self- identification as indigenous peoples at the individual level and accepted by the community as their member. Historical continuity with pre-colonial and/or pre-settler societies Strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources Distinct social, economic or political systems Distinct language, culture and beliefs Form non-dominant groups of society Resolve to maintain and reproduce their ancestral environments and systems as distinctive peoples and communities. A question of identity According to the UN the most fruitful approach is to identify, rather than define indigenous peoples. This is based on the fundamental criterion of self-identification as underlined in a number of human rights documents. https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf Additional Resources: https://midwiferytoday.com/mt-articles/traditional-midwives-are-midwives/ https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B67ejH46ELQ_UE43RXUxRG1Qak5DSFpJUk9MZE9jSmJwanB V/view?usp=sharing App 3-18Appendix 4: Training and access to emergency drugs and devices. The role of oxygen in neonatal resuscitation Approximately 10% of newborns require some assistance to begin breathing at birth. Less than 1% require extensive resuscitation measures, 4 such as cardiac compressions and medications. Although most newly born infants successfully transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life without special help, because of the large total number of births, a significant number will require some degree of resuscitation. 3 Newly born infants who do not require resuscitation can be generally identified upon delivery by rapidly assessing the answers to the following 3 questions: Term gestation? Good tone? Breathing or crying? If the answer to all 3 questions is \"yes,\" the newly born infant may stay with the mother for routine care. Routine care means the infant is dried, placed skin to skin with the mother, and covered with dry linen to maintain a normal temperature. Observation of breathing, activity, and color must be ongoing. If the answer to any of these assessment questions is \"no,\" the infant should be moved to a radiant warmer to receive 1 or more of the following 4 actions in sequence: A.Initial steps in stabilization (warm and maintain normal temperature, position, clear secretions only if copious and/or obstructing the airway, dry, stimulate) B.Ventilate and oxygenate C.Initiate chest compressions D.Administer epinephrine and/or volume Approximately 60 seconds (\"the Golden Minute\") are allotted for completing the initial steps, reevaluating, and beginning ventilation if required ( Figure 1 ). Although the 60-second mark is not precisely defined by science, it is important to avoid unnecessary delay in initiation of ventilation, because this is the most important step for successful resuscitation of the newly born who has not responded to the initial steps. The decision to progress beyond the initial steps is determined by simultaneous assessment of 2 vital characteristics: respirations (apnea, gasping, or labored or unlabored breathing) and heart rate (less than 100/min). Methods to accurately assess the heart rate will be discussed in detail in the section on Assessment of Heart Rate. Once positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) or supplementary oxygen administration is started, assessment should consist of simultaneous evaluation of 3 vital characteristics: heart rate, respirations, and oxygen saturation, as determined by pulse oximetry and discussed under Assessment of Oxygen Need and Appendix 4 - Training and Access to Emergency Drugs and Devices App 4-1Administration of Oxygen. The most sensitive indicator of a successful response to each step is an increase in heart rate. 3 https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/136/Supplement_2/S196 https://www.aap.org/en-us/continuing-medical-education/life-support/NRP/Pages/About- NRP.aspx WHO Recommendations for the prevention of PPH (1) \"The use of uterotonics for the prevention of PPH during the third stage of labour is recommended for all births.

It is a relatively common illness, occurring in 1% to 12% of newborn infants. Antibiotics used in the prevention of gonococcal ophthalmia (tetracycline and erythromycin) may be more effective than silver nitrate and they are considered to be acceptable alternatives ( 2,11-14). Tetracycline is more active than erythromycin in vitro against sensitive isolates of N gonorrhoeae . The estimated failure rate of tetracycline prophylaxis is 0.012%, while that of erythromycin is 0.005% ( 9). Other agents may also be effective in prophylaxis. The use of these agents may also provide some benefit in the prevention of ophthalmia due to other organisms. As well, the Canadian Paediatric Society supports routine prenatal screening for N gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis , and the treatment of identified infections during pregnancy. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2795679/ The use of erythromycin eye ointment in newborns has its roots in the late 1800s. Back then, about 10% of newborns born in hospitals across Europe developed an illness called ophthalmia neonatorum. This illness caused blindness in 3% of affected infants (Schaller & Klauss, 2001). App 4-3https://evidencebasedbirth.com/is-erythromycin-eye-ointment-always-necessary-for-newborns / Vitamin K in the Newborn Period Failure to receive vitamin K after birth significantly increases the risk of vitamin K dependent bleeding (VKDB). VKDB has been classified as early (<24 hours of age), classical (days 1-7) and late (> 1 week and < 6 months of age). Late VKDB is usually characterized by intracranial bleeding and carries a high risk of negative neurodevelopmental impact. The risk for late VKDB is 81 times greater among infants not receiving vitamin K intramuscularly compared to those receiving this treatment.

The antibiotics help protect babies from infection, but only if given during labor. Doctors cannot give antibiotics before labor begins because the bacteria can grow back quickly. Clinicians give the antibiotic by IV (through the vein). Clinicians most commonly prescribe a type of antibiotic called beta-lactams, which includes penicillin and ampicillin. https://www.cdc.gov/groupbstrep/about/prevention.html Use of Intravenous Fluids in the Treatment of Postpartum Hemorrhage Most common causes of postpartum blood loss: 70% Primary coagulopathy Thrombin <1% From a transfusion requirement perspective, among women who fit the basic diagnostic criteria for PPH there are generally 3 groups: Mild PPH May require fluid resuscitation but generally respond to first line pharmacological treatment Do not require blood products. https://www.ucc.ie/en/media/research/nationalperinatalepidemiologycentre/npecstudyday201 6/PPH_Transfusion_Strategies_NPEC_2017.pdf ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 181: Management of Alloimmunization During Pregnancy Rho (D) immune globulin per ACOG; In the United States, a recommendation for the administration of anti-D immune globulin was introduced in the 1970s. The current practice of administering a single antenatal dose of 300 micrograms of anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks of gestation followed by a second dose after birth when newborn Rh D typing has identified the infant as Rh positive.

We are thankful we had the opportunity to work on the report for the Hawai'i Home Birth Task Force regarding Act 32 with the other concerned task force members. Act 32 clearly mandates this community of \"birth attendants\" DEFINE THEMSELVES and develop common standards, accountability measures, and disclosure requirements\" (Act 32 Part I Section 1). In the four short months of meetings HiHBC has seen \"this community\" accomplish all of what it was asked to do in this section and clearly outline this in the task force report. How to incorporate themselves into a \"statute that will incorporate ALL birth practitioners and allow them to practice to the fullest extent under the law\" has been more challenging, primarily due to opposition from ACOG and DCCA to fulfill what is mandated (\"define themselves... and incorporate ALL birth practitioners and allow them to practice to the fullest extent under the law\"). Once again, the statute clearly states this community is to DEFINE THEMSELVES, not be defined by others. We are confused as to why ACOG or DCCA feel they have the right to tell this community who they are and how they should practice and insists on filing separate appendices, for example. This community is self determined and knows clearly who they are. The Task Force Report speaks for itself, as the statute requires. We are however optimistic because we did have a unanimous decision from all task force members to continue working on this complex issue together. We look forward to finding consensus and fulfillment of what Act 32 mandated, and anticipate producing a second report before the dissolution of the task force to fulfill the purpose of this act. We sincerely appreciate your hard work as Chair. Mahalo, HiHBC Board of Directors Appendix 6 - Comments by Task Force Members and the Public App 6-1Dear Kristie Duarte Home Birth Task Force Chair and Public Member I am reaching out as a member of the community in regards to the Home Birth Task Force Committee Report and Findings. As many legislators know, this law was extremely controversial and passed despite the mass majority of the public being in opposition to it. Upon looking at the data collection performed by both HIHBC and the department of health birth certificate informat ion, it appears we do not have a public health crisis when it comes to home birth in Hawaii. Our diverse group of home birth midwives are having safer outcomes than the hospitals, despite the lack of licensing and regulation. With these numbers reveale d, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for Act 32 for creating the opportunity to allow non -CM and non -CPM midwives to define themselves and find pathways for exemption of licensure. The public supports an alternative to licensure for non -CM/CPM m idwives for a variety of reasons and just as every family has the right to a licensed medical midwife, they also have a right to a traditional midwife without fear of persecution of their chosen provider. It is crucial for the legislative body to understan d that even if they personally would not choose a home birth, it is not the State's responsibility to choose or limit the choice for someone else. I am in agreement for continued data collection. The suggestion of updating birth certificate forms for mo re accurate collection is an important step in understanding the numbers we are looking at. I agree that registration through HIHBC is an appropriate alternative to licensure for non-CM/CPM midwives for accountability purposes. I agree that the title \"midwife\" is too broad for the medical community to claim, and the suggestion of using licensed or unlicensed midwife is more accurate and transparent for the public to understand. I agree with the addition of the PEP process for CPMs and removing the deadline date for the bridge certificate. It is the only way for Hawaii's student midwives to obtain a CPM certificate locally.

MYTH: SB 1033 is needed because a better bill is not possible. 18 Bibliography 19 App 6-4Introduction Hnau (birth)is in many ways Hawaii's most ancient tradition. Nearly 100% of all births in the Kingdom of Hawaii prior to 1893 happened at home. And attending those births, from the most ancient Kanaka Maoli ancestors in the mists of time, to the plantation camps and villages of every ethnicity that arrived here, were midwives. Kanaka Maoli pale keiki. Japanese sanba. Filipino partera. Each had a rich knowledge of of tradition, and how that tradition could be used, along with knowledge of health and the workings of the body, to safely bring forth the next generation. Despite the medicalization of birth in 20th Century, some of these traditions survived. This practical birth knowledge is important. It is also fragile, and in imminent danger of extermination \u2014 much is already gone. The thing that makes birthing knowledge difcult to keep alive is that, to preserve it, it must be perpetuated through practice. If SB 1033 passes into law, the only way to keep this knowledge alive will be to continue it underground, where these practices were prior to 1999. Out-of-hospital birth is very much a matter of reproductive choice. And one thing we should all know about matters of reproductive freedom is that forcing practices underground does not stop them; it only endangers lives. Birthing freedom is also a matter of human rights, indigenous rights, and civil liberty. A better law is absolutely possible, and we have outlined a picture of what such a law would look like here. However, the only way to achieve this is to stop this terrible measure from moving forward, and start over. Governor Ige, we urge you, on behalf of all of the midwives and other traditional birth attendants who helped to bring your ancestors into this world, and all of those continuing their legacy, wherever they mar be: VETO SB 1033 SD2 HD2. We hope that this report, which was written with 100% volunteer labor, and is in itself an act of love, will help your understanding of this matter to grow. And we know that when it does, you will understand how important this protection really is. Please veto SB 1033. Mahalo nut loa for your attention to this very urgent matter. Mahalo nui loa. App 6-5Major Problems with SB 1033 at a Glance Constitutionally protected practices are not protected. Alleged protections for Indigenous Kanaka Maoli practices are purely speculative. Papa Ola Lkahi does not have the means to protect Kanaka midwifery at this time. While this could possibly be developed (subject to convening and agreement of kupuna), it has not been developed yet. Constitutional Protections must be actual (existig at all times), not speculative (possibly existing at some point in the future). Papa Ola Lkahi also does not have the means to protect the central practice in question, which is hnau (birth), which requires assistance from traditional practitioners who are not Kanaka Maoli. Religious and spiritual practices are not protected at all, as required by the constitution. Faith-based midwifery is a longstanding tradition practiced by many cultures and churches, as well as indigenous midwifery of many lands. These are deep- rooted traditions that are protected by the US Constitution, the Hawaii State Constitution, and federal law. SB 1033 is DISCRIMINATORY as applied. Hawaii-born midwives and students are excluded, as licensure is only available to CPMs. 100% of all CPMs eligible for licensure are from outside of Hawaii. There is NO equivalency pathway, as was recommended by the 2017 Audit. 100% of local-born practitioners are made illegal in 2023. Some are made illegal in 2020. There is no feasible means for practitioners born and raised in Hawaii to achieve legitimacy and legality. All cultures and religions whose practices are made illegal in 2020 or 2023 are discriminated against by this measure, which only benets Caucasian CPMs from outside of Hawaii (as the 2 eligible POC CPMs are both traditional, and ghting the bill). \"Fixing\" a bad bill through a task force that needs to develop another bill to attempt to bring this one into compliance (IF the legislature agrees) is NOT a solution to discrimination. Remedies through these means are again speculative \u2014 addressing the problem of discrimination needs to be done in the bill itself, because laws cannot be discriminatory for ANY length of time. To be clear, there is nothing wrong with Caucasian midwives, who are represented in both CPM and traditional categories. There is a problem when ONLY Caucasian CPMs from the Continental US are legally able to ll the diverse needs of Hawaii's local communities, and other practitioners, including elders of many cultures, are criminalized. SB 1033 is special interest legislation, and not compliant with the Regulatory Licensing Reform Act, which requires \"all qualied members\" of a profession\" to have equivalent access. Only 10-13 members of a much larger profession are licensed, with no equivalency pathway. Exempting the bodies in SB 1033 from the Sunshine Law is wrong, and should not be allowed. Many of the problems in the measure are due to this law not being properly followed in the rst place. Transparent, inclusive communication is needed, per the OIP. Report to Governor SB 1033 VETO Request Page \u0000 of \u00002 21 App with SB 1033 at a Glance (ctd) SB 1033 Makes family assistance illegal. Family members are illegal unless they are a \"spouse, domestic partner, parent, sibling, or child\". Grandparents, aunts, uncles, lanai family, cousins (all of whom play traditional attendant roles in many cultures) are all illegal. SB 1033 harms the public. It limits the availability of options. It creates dangerous birth conditions by driving legitimate practices underground. It interferes with women's reproductive choices. It articially drives up costs. It reduces birth privacy, by overburdening scarce preceptors with the volume of student need that would be created. SB 1033 is divisive, and harms communication between midwives, as well as between midwives and hospital staff in the event of a hospital transport, by driving them underground. SB 1033 attempts to x something that is not broken. The passage of this bill has been based on statements and testimony that is simply false, or only partially true (with very important pieces missing)! There has been NO actual evidence of abuse by any midwife. There is no evidence that it is needed. \"Horror stories\" about alleged midwife error are continually debunked. A 2017 survey of home birth parents showed 94.6% satisfaction. There is zero actual evidence that this would be safer or benecial for families. SB 1033 misses the elements that ARE needed, such as education for the public, effective data collection, comprehensive problem-solving, and the building of better communication. The public does not want SB 1033. Over 2000 people signed a petition against it. Over 700 pages of opposing testimony were submitted Major organizations have opposed it, such as The Health Committee of the Democratic Party of Hawaii Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA) City Council of Maui Pono Hawaii Initiative Report to Governor SB 1033 VETO Request Page \u0000 of \u00003 21 App 6-7Hawaii Midwives by Ethnicity Report to Governor SB 1033 VETO Request Page \u0000 of \u00004 21 Estimated Total: 13There are approximately 13 CPMs currently eligible for licensure in Hawaii. 100% of these are originally from outside of Hawaii. There are no local-born CPMs in Hawaii. There is NO pathway that would allow any local-born person to achieve licensure prior to the 2023 \"drop dead\" date, after which all non-CPMs become illegal. Most local midwives can never achieve CPM status, due to costs, continental location of schools, and time required away from Hawaii.Note: the only midwives in these two ethnic categories are also traditional practitioners, and OPPOSE SB 1033 Estimated Total: 60 Estimates for traditional midwives and student midwives serving all ethnic groups based on 22 meetings, 14 interviews, and community research. This does not include culture-specic midwives. The standard for criminalization being applied is: subject to $1000 ne and damages to reputation for non-compliance with requirements that the birth attendant is unable to meet within the timeframes in the measure, for cultural, spiritual, economic or logistic reasons.

Report No. 17-01 January 2017 http://files.hawaii.gov/auditor/Reports/2017/17-01.pdf \"The proposed regulation of CPMs is flawed because it does not require licensure and benets one group of midwives.\" - p15 \"We expect that regulation of the practice of midwifery will likely reduce options for mothers interested in a midwife-assisted home birth.\" - p.39 Hawai'i Regulatory Licensing Reform Act \"Evidence of abuses by providers of the service must be given great weight in determining whether regulation is desirable.\" There have been no proven cases of abuse by midwives in Hawaii. Virtually every example that has been brought forward in the course of SB 1033 testimony has been either examined through community process and found to be non-abusive (i.e. debunked) or possibly nonexistent, and based on rumor. Partial stories and hearsay have unfortunately caused reactions that have not been properly informed. These would not hold up in a court, and should not be used to create law. \"Regulation must not unreasonably restrict entry into professions and vocations by all qualied persons\"SB 1033 violates the Hawaii Licensing Reform Act by creating a singular pathway that cannot be reasonably achieved by anyone but a CPM trained outside of Hawaii. There are many skilled pathways recognized elsewhere that are ignored by SB 1033. \"Regulation must be avoided if it will articially increase the cost of goods and services to consumers, except in cases where this cost is exceeded by the potential danger to the consumer.\"Since there is no danger to consumers, and since many midwives typically do 24 or fewer births per year, the costs passed to consumers is tremendous. Studies have shown that regulatory licensing does NOT increase safety.; Hawaii is amongst the most burdened.

Constitutional Rights MUST have ACTUAL PROTECTIONS at all times.(concept originally proposed by Josh Green in 2014) App 6-10The requirement for CPM status in SB 1033 is discriminatory. This is largely because MEAC-accredited schooling is prohibitively expensive and distant for Hawaii midwives, the majority of whom are low-income healers, many with small children. These midwives are also already integral parts of their communities, and uprooting them so that they can receive training that many already have equivalency for is wrong. The Facts about MEAC Schooling: There are 11 Total MEAC-Accredited Schools Tuition ranges from $10,000-$90,000 Most programs are 2-3 years with some outliers Seven schools offer distance learning, 4 do not. Of the seven distance learning programs, three require regular travel to the learning site, and one is currently on probationary status, leaving only 3 schools that do not require regular travel or relocation from Hawaii. These are: National College of Midwifery Taos, NM Approx $10,500 2-5 yrs full time Midwives College of Utah Approx $45,000 4-6 years full timeSouthwest Wisconsin Technical College Approx: $10,130 yrs w 3 preceptors w/contracts, must be on 24/7 call, near zero absences Tuition does not include travel expense, books or the cost of CPM certication itself which is an additional $2500. Preceptors vary in training charges. Some do not charge, and others do. This is an additional expense. It is unlikely that students would have a choice, due to rarity and geographic considerations. Midwifery is not a high-prot \"Profession.\" Community midwives can't afford this. A note on apprenticeship: In Hawaii, across all islands, there are only a handful of approved NARM preceptors. Anyone who attends any of the schools listed below will have to attend approximately 60 births under the supervision of an approved preceptor REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY BIRTHS THEY HA VE ALREADY ATTENDED. The homebirth rate in Hawaii is low. It may take 2 or three years for an approved preceptor to attend 60 births and any apprentices they choose to take on will have to share this number of births between them. It follows that anyone who seeks to achieve CPM and thus Hawaii State Licensure by attending one of the MEAC accredited schools will probably have to leave the State in order to fulll the clinical requirements involved. The added cost of this should be factored in when considering even the distance learning options on this list. Report to Governor SB 1033 VETO Request Page \u0000 of \u00007 21Licensure under SB 1033 requires CPM status, which is not achievable for most local people from Hawaii. CPM status involves graduation from a MEAC (Midwifery Education Accreditation Council) school ($10,000 min), Apprenticeships of at least 60 births with a CPM preceptor (which realistically means travel for unpaid work), and $2500 on top of tuition for Certication. Licensure cost ($1000/yr) is on top of all of this. App 6-11What is a Traditional Midwife? The spectrum of midwifery largely exists between two major axis points: Traditional and Clinical. Most midwifery practices exist somewhere along this spectrum. Here is the recognized MANA denition of Traditional Midwifery: Report to Governor Page \u0000 \u00008 21TRADITIONAL MIDWIFERY Requires traditional mentorship from elders, hands-on work known in community and to elders Utilizes ancient techniques, herbs, traditional cultural practices, etc. Validity through recognition by elders, community Emphasizes ancient techniques, culture, ancient traditional knowledge Essentially a cultural, spiritual practice Mandates are primarily cultural, spiritual, based on mandates of training lineage Exchange based on traditional principles (can involve money, gifts, trade, or no compensation, depending on tradition) CLINICAL MIDWIFERY Requires formal (school) training, documented hours of hands-on practice with recognized preceptor Utilizes certain medical devices, techniques, drugs - IV, O2, pitocin injections, etc. along with herbs, etc. Validity through certification, recognition by established professional bodies Emphasizes modern techniques, research, updated knowledge Essentially a professional practice Mandates are primarily legal, professional, based on training and law Exchange based on fair business model, often involves some gratis services It must be emphasized that this is a spectrum, and not a dichotomy. Most actual practices exist at some point along this continuum, with many variations that work for that particular midwife. Safety is best assured when midwives practice according to their own cultural and professional mandates, skills, and community needs. Traditional Midwifery \"In addition, there are midwives who\u2014for religious, personal, and philosophical reasons\u2014 choose not to become certied or licensed. Typically they are called traditional midwives. They believe that they are ultimately accountable to the communities they serve; or that midwifery is a social contract between the midwife and client/patient, and should not be legislated at all; or that women have a right to choose qualied care providers regardless of their legal status.\" - Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA), \"Types of Midwives\" https://mana.org/about-midwives/types-of-midwife App 6-12Traditional Midwifery: Indigenous Governor SB 1033 VETO Request Page \u0000 of \u00009 21 The roots of all midwifery \u2014 and obstetric practice, for that matter \u2014 are in the indigenous cultures they have come from. Birthing knowledge, along with food lore, farming methods, herbal medicines, and other practices, are being recognized worldwide as crucial to sustainability and human survival and diversity. These practices are threatened and fragile. They are being extinguished with urbanization and medicalization. To continue into the future, they must be practiced. Furthermore, that practice must be directed by healers themselves, and not by external forces, because their healing power lies in their veracity, which is easily lost through interference. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR) both recognize cultural practices, including health practices, as a fundamental right. Protection of these practices must be actual, and without lapse. The revival of indigenous midwifery is improving health outcomes worldwide. From Africa to Standing Rock, midwifery traditions are making a comeback, and achieving excellent results. Alignment with this cultural revival would benet the State of Hawaii greatly. App 6-13Knaka Maoli Hnau and Midwifery: Overview As in any ancient culture, birth is Hawaii's oldest cultural practice. Before Kapiolani Maternity home opened in 1890, the entire population was born outside of a hospital setting. Midwives have always been an important part of this picture. Ancient Kanaka Maoli Midwifery While specialty kahuna attended the births of the highest chiefs, and might intervene for complications, most Kanaka births, since ancient times, were generally attended by immediate family and/or traditional community midwives, who used knowledge passed through generations. As hnau is traditionally seen as an active process controlled by the wahine giving birth (as opposed to a passive process in which emphasis is on \"delivery\" by professionals, in American thought) along with the direction of the child him/herself and ancestral \"messages\", part of the mother's kuleana (responsibility/right) is choosing the proper location for her baby's birth, and the proper attendants, based upon her personal understanding of what is needed and pono. Midwifery Remains Important. This continued through the early 20th Century, and in many cases, through the present day. Much of this was cultural. Only six babies were born in Kapiolani Home in the rst year it opened (1890), as Native Hawaiian women remained suspicious of doctors and institutions. * In some rural areas, there is still no realistic access to hospital facilities, and while many will stay in or near a hospital for days or weeks to give birth, others simply follow their community traditions of birthing at home. In some of these areas, trained midwives still serve their communities, some of them learning their skills from early youth, and receiving many years of knowledge transmission and experience from kupuna, and sometimes haole or other immigrant midwives. Most of this has been done underground. Forced medicalization, licensure and persecution of healers (see Timeline), along with perceptions of discrimination and mistreatment for birth choices has led to deep wariness and secrecy. Rural families commonly report births as \"accidental\", and omit midwife information (note: family-attended births may be more common than midwife-attended births in some areas, where midwives are only called in as needed). This approach has indeed kept the practices from being wiped out, according to families interviewed, but may limit the ability to transmit medical information in the event of an emergency. Revitalization of Tradition. Since 1999, with the advent of decriminalization of midwifery practices in Hawaii, a new generation of Kanaka Maoli mothers revitalizing hnau traditions, and in many cases becoming student midwives themselves, has arisen. Through them, hope has been rekindled for traditional Kanaka Maoli birthing practices to achieve even broader revitalization, even in urban areas.

The trouble is that: 1) this is not guaranteed protection, as it is up to the kupuna, and not the legislature to recognize (SPECULATIVE), and 2) the primary practice being revitalized is HNAU (birth), and not midwifery. Practitioners of Hnau (Hawaiian mothers revitalizing ancestral traditions) rely on midwives and other birth attendants who are not Kanaka Maoli by blood or practice. They also rely on the ability of these birth attendants to attend other births in the community, including those that are not Knaka Maoli. Report to Governor SB 1033 VETO Request Page of \u000011 21 Hnau Practitioners (Mkuahine) The 1998 Kahuna Statement is at the foundation of Papa Ola Lkahis Healer Recognition system. This statement was very clear: it is inappropriate for the State of Hawaii to ascertain licensure matters relating to Hawaiian Healing Practices. Kahuna Statement 1998 (excerpt) (1) THAT WE ARE ONLY INSTRUMENTS IN THE HEALING PROCESS AND THAT THE TRUE SOURCE OF HEALING COMES FROM THE ALMIGHTY , KNOWN AS AKUA, 'IO, OR GOD. IT IS THIS SOURCE THAT GIVES US OUR CALLING TO PRACTICE; (2)THAT THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAI`I IS NOT KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THE HEALING TRADITIONS OF THE HAWAIIAN PEOPLE; AND (3) THAT WHILE WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED S.B. 1946, THE BLOOD QUANTUM, LICENSURE, AND CERTIFICATION ISSUES RAISED IN THE LEGISLATION ARE INAPPROPRIATE AND CULTURALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR GOVERNMENT TO ASCERTAIN.

There were Chinese, Portuguese, and eventually Filipino, Japanese, Okinawan and other cultural midwives. Like Knaka Maoli, these communities did not see birth as a medical emergency or event, but as a natural part of life needing minimal intervention. Control of immigrant midwives was intrinsically linked to control of plantation workers themselves. Along with harsh educational assimilation programs, the Territory of Hawaii actively sought to medicalize birthing practices amongst the immigrant population. Between 1910 and 1920, Territorial obstetricians sought to eliminate midwifery entirely, but were met with opposition. In 1931, in concert with its clampdown on medical kahuna (see Timeline), the Territorial Board of Health required registration of midwives. By 1937 it had hired a midwife overseer, Alice Young, a Chinese nurse-midwife who inspected midwife bags, supervised births, and attempted to ease tensions between the midwives and government, as restrictions imposed by the Territorial Board of Health continued to increase. In 1941, the Territory made it illegal to practice midwifery without a license, and began to restrict its licensure to nurse-midwives, which became ofcial in 1976. This nearly exterminated immigrant traditional midwifery, and drove its remaining practices underground, where very little was known about them. The rules under Sections 321-13 to 321-15 had essentially become obsolete, and sunset in 1989, re-emerging as Hawaii's existing CNM licensure, which did not address traditional births. After decriminalization in 1999, non-nurse midwifery began to rise again amongst settlers, as it was re-emerging amongst Kanaka Maoli. Post-plantation immigrants, including neighboring Polynesians, Micronesians, and settlers from other States and countries, brought with them their birthing traditions. Birth Centers, and other options available outside of Hawaii, were proposed, and consciousness of the worldwide revival of birthing traditions grew. Strong relationships were formed between traditional midwives, and tensions arose as legislation \u2014 every version of which essentially outlawed traditional practices \u2014 was proposed.

Any person who shall attempt the cure of another by the practice of sorcery, witchcraft...or other superstitious or deceitful methods, shall be ned in a sum not less than one hundred dollars or be imprisoned not to exceed six months at hard labor.' 1865: Extermination through Licensure: \"Increasing Western influence on such cultural practices triggered inconsistent laws for over a century. (This) set up an obstacle for all legitimate practitioners, requiring them to go through a licensing process to practice. There is no record of the government issuing licenses to kahuna at this time.\" June 1, 1868: Kingdom Law recognizing healers. \"a motion to allow traditional Hawaiian practitioners to practice passed. One legislator argued: Hawaiians were all dying under the influence of foreign medicine. If a man died under a native doctor, the doctor would probably be taken up for murder. No one could deny that natives had died at the Queens Hospital.\" 1890s: Anti-healer fervor in buildup to Overthrow. As the monarchy sought to restore traditions, fervor grew amongst U.S. settlers in the attack of \"dangerous\" healing and spirituality. From an 1891 article: \"Kahunadom must be discredited, and then it may die out. It cannot be stamped by force unless it was possible to convict a dozen or so of kahunas of manslaughter.\" 1893: Outlawing of kahuna and healing practices. All kahuna practices were banned following the takeover by the Committee of Safety and ensuing Provisional Government and Republic. Many healers were actively persecuted. Practices continued in secrecy. 1919: Territory of Hawaii authorizes Hawaiian Medicine Board to issue licenses to Hawaiian herbalists. This required a written exam, with tests including the latin names for plants used, before a primarily Caucasian examination board. Hawaiian healers could not pass this exam. The Board was dismantled as obsolete in 1965. 1998: Act 162 temporarily exempted Native Hawaiian practitioners from state licensure, to give time to structure parameters. These were developed through subsequent legislation. Under the administration of Papa Ola Lokahi, kupuna councils recognizing specic practices (currently Lomilomi, Hooponopono and eventually, Laau Kahea) could apply for recognition through Papa Ola Lokahi. Councils would keep records and resolve any problems arising with their individual practitioners. This has worked well. It must be noted, however, that midwifery is not included amongst the practices recognized, and that the original Kahuna Statement at the foundation of the Council system stands against legislative dictation of recognition. 2019: SB 1033 SD2, HD2 passes House and Senate. This measure, if enacted, would again repress or outlaw traditional Kanaka Maoli healing practices. The most signicant practice affected would be the practice of hnau (birth) itself, which, according to tradition, is practiced by each wahine in the manner she deems appropriate, with assistants chosen by her specically. Practices of Pale Keiki (midwifery) would also be forced underground, westernized, or exterminated. Sources: Chun, Malcolm Naea.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS RELATING TO TRADITIONAL HAWAIIAN HEALING PRACTICES SINCE 1985.Pukui, Mary K., E.W. Haertig, and Catherine A. Lee. Nn i ke Kumu: Look to the Source. V ol. 1,1972 Testimony on SB 1033 SD2 HD1 Before the Committee on Finance of the House of Representatives, State of Hawaii, March 29, App 6-17Spiritual Birth & Midwifery Practices Another important area of traditional midwifery is in faith-based midwifery practices. These may be associated with a church or faith, or they may be individual spiritual practices. Hawaii has Christian, Muslim and Rastafarian practitioners, along with others. Many are highly skilled, as well as strong in their faith. Indigenous practices, in and of themselves, are also often faith-based, as indigenous cultural practice connotes spiritual bonds, ancestral obligations, and direction that should be respected. SB 1033 does not adequately respect faith-based practices, which are constitutionally protected. Examples: The consent release listed in Section 6(5)C, requiring a signed consent form, violates some religious practices, which forbid State interference in a spiritual process. Many spiritual healers view their relationship with those they assist as a divinely mandated. While they follow principles of health and safety, these are determined by a righteous relationship, or pono. Following State mandates that may not be Pono violates their rights to practice their religion without interference. The separation of Church and State should go both ways. Birthing itself is a spiritual process for many parents practicing faith-based birth. If faith- based midwives are made illegal in 2023, they would be forced to be unassisted in order to practice the spiritual practice of birthing in a faith-based setting. This is dangerous, and imposing secular practices (or no assistance) on to faith-based birthing practices violates the freedom of religion for the parents.

Besides sometimes people can't make it to the hospital on time.\" - Indira, Oahu (from Pohnpei) \"My Tutu's, my grandmother and her sister were midwives in the villages from Kaupo to Hana before the dispensary was built. After 2 hospital births, i chose to have my last 2 children at home.\" - Noelani, KauaiCarrying On T raditions App 6-18Myths and Facts 1. 1033 would make home birth safer. FACT: SB 1033 is dangerous, and does not address actual safety. In a 2017 survey of Hawaii home birth families, nearly 36% were found to live in areas that were at least 45 minutes from the nearest hospital; in some cases, hours. There are too few CPMs to serve this population. Outlawing traditional midwives puts some families in the position where their only legal option is an unassisted birth. SB 1033 creates dangerous transport scenarios with poor communication. When problems arise in a home birth that require medical assistance, two crucial variables make the biggest difference in outcome: 1. Timing of transport, and2. Communication. Both of these are harmed by SB 1033, by forcing the majority of practitioners underground with no feasible recourse to legality. The climate of fear created by a state of illegality has been shown to be harmful to labor itself. In addition, it is known to delay transport decisions. It should be noted that the nal say in when to transport to a hospital is the decision of the mother, not the midwife. Mothers may delay transport due to bad experiences with hospitals or fear of repercussions. Fear of trauma, discrimination or unwarranted child removal is increased amongst ethnic groups, such as Kanaka Maoli and African-Americans, who have experienced actual systemic prejudice in their communities. Birthing with an illegal traditional midwife could increase that fear signicantly, resulting in avoidance of medical services and delay of transport. If a midwife is illegal, she cannot accompany the mother to the hospital, due to fear this might increase systemic danger to the parents and the likelihood of a child welfare accusation. She cannot provide medical records, birth information, or the story of what happened. The mother is unlikely to disclose information that she may fear might be used against her or her midwife. This creates a gaping chasm at a critical point in a medical crisis. It has been historically proven that forcing a reproductive choice underground is never a safe thing to do. SB 1033 does exactly this. By making traditional practices illegal, it widens the communication gap between them and medical professionals, and between families and doctors as well. Furthermore, SB 1033 does not address actual safety. There is no evidence that licensure of midwives increases safety for mothers and babies anywhere; in fact, there is evidence that safety is decreased overall where licensure has been mandated.

MYTH: Home birth is dangerous; hospitals are safe. FACT: They are about the same. However, rates of unnecessary interventions and obstetric violence are higher in planned hospital births, and successful vaginal delivery rates are highest at home. Planned home birth with the possibility to a transport to the hospital if needed are as safe as planned hospital births, or more. As shown by a recent review of international studies, out-of-hospital birth safety increases with the increase of communication with a referral network of obstetric care when needed. SB 1033, however, actually cuts all communication, depriving both the non-medical birthing system and the medical one from their reciprocal containment of respective risks (medical emergency on one hand, and unnecessary or abusive interventions on the other). Home birth and hospital births have similar morbidity rates but for different reasons. Home births have the highest rates of uncomplicated birth and the lowest rates of medical interventions, which leads to lower negative outcomes initiated by such interventions. For instance, in the US the rate of cesarean sections among US hospital births in 2006 was 30.2%, against the evidence-based approach presented by the WHO which suggests that hospital births should not have a c-section rate over 10-15%, while the rate of cesarean sections among home births in 2004-2009 was even lower, that is 5.2%. If we consider high-resource settings like the Netherlands, where maternal mortality after cesarean section is 3 times higher than after vaginal birth, we can understand the importance of lowering the risk of unnecessary medical interventions. The rates of obstetric violence, that is, abuses perpetrated by OB/GYN personnel, that women face during hospital births are also high. Among survey respondents in the Listening to Mothers Study III (n=2400), 30% of black and Hispanic primiparous women and 21% of white women who delivered in hospitals in the United States reported that they sometimes or always felt \"treated poorly because of a difference of opinion with [their] caregivers about the right care for [herself or her] baby\". In the same study, 25% of women who had experienced an induction of labor or a cesarean section felt pressured to accept those interventions, 59% of women who received episiotomies did not give consent at all, and 63% of women experiencing a primary Cesarean section and 47% of women who had a repeat C-Section reported that the provider made the \"final decision\" about whether they would receive cesarean surgery .

MYTH: Many Hawaii midwives lack rigorous training i.e. \"Self trained\" and \"haven't had a formal education or done apprenticeships\" (Star Bulletin, 4/15/19) FACT: There is NO evidence of any untrained midwife in Hawaii. a Non-CPM midwives in Hawaii have an estimated average of 1.5 years of formal schooling or equivalent1, 2.5 years of hands-on apprenticeship, and 7 years of experience attending births. While this varies widely, NO Hawaii midwives (using the title \"midwife\") were found to have less than 1 year of schooling or equivalent, 1 year of hands-on apprenticeship, and 3 years attending births. Midwifery training - both traditional and clinical - is intensive and Report to Governor SB 1033 VETO Request Page \u0000 of \u000016 21 App 6-20rigorous. Hawaii's midwifery community is small. With the exception of culture-specic traditional midwives whose practices exist deep within specic communities, the vast majority of midwives and birth workers are known to one another. Out of 45 midwives, students, doulas, cultural experts and home birth parents questioned (ranging from clinical to very traditional) 2, none had ever met or heard of a person in Hawaii representing themselves as a midwife who was \"self-trained\" or had not done some form of intensive apprenticeship prior to attending births without supervision. \"Formal education\" was variable: about 70% had heard of someone practicing without this, which is consistent with the intensive cultural training required of indigenous healers and other known equivalencies. Two people on islands other than Oahu said that they had heard \"rumors\" of people reportedly calling themselves \"midwives\" with no known credentials; however, these were said to have quickly left Hawaii, without having done any births, to the knowledge of those interviewed. 4. MYTH: Hawaii Midwives had licenses revoked elsewhere FACT: No midwife in Hawaii has had a license revoked or suspended. Revoked licenses are listed on the NARM website: https://narm.org/accountability/revocation-of-certication/. No Hawaii midwives appear (out of only 6 since 2000) . No State licenses have been revoked. This is one of many examples of false rumors used in SB 1033 promotion. 5. MYTH: SB 1033 Stops \"dangerous\" midwives. FACT: \"Dangerous\" midwives * are not stopped, but legitimate ones are. It should be noted that SB 1033 would not stop anyone who was actually problematic. Because no public education is provided, because the nes for infractions are the same as the cost for annual licensure, and because midwives have always been able to operate underground through periods of illegality, this would not stop an actual charlatan at all. Fortunately, there is no evidence that charlatan midwives have existed in Hawaii in our time. The only midwives potentially stopped by this are those who are so law-abiding that they will shut down rather than break the law, while everyone else goes underground. Are those the midwives the State of Hawaii really wants to shut down? * If they exist at all, as their existence in Hawaii has NOT been proven. 1 Equivalency may consist of formal or informal but intensive training with master practitioners, study with multiple elders, or other means of equivalency recognized by the culture in question and the community of midwifery2 Interviews conducted May 2014 to April 2019, consisting of 45 participants; 3 CPMs 5 non-CPM midwives, 12 Student Midwives, former student midwives, or Doulas; 7 traditional elders, 2 naturopaths, and 16 home birth parents not represented in other categories.See: Horsley, Ritta Jo, and Richard A. Horsley. \"On the Trail of the 'Witches:\" Wise Women, Midwives and the European Witch Hunts.\" Women in German Yearbook, vol. 3, 1987, pp. 1-28 6. MYTH: SB 1033 is based on community input. FACT: The community was NOT consulted in creating this measure. SB 1033 was created through a flawed and discriminatory process: Note: There is no record of this process, which did not follow Chapter 91 rules. This is the best we can ascertain what happened: 1 Midwives Alliance of Hawaii (MAH), representing pro-licensure CPMs/ CNMs, requested licensure. 2. DOH convened a \"Hawaii Maternal and Infant Health Collaborative\" to create legislation. The collaborative consisted of medical, government and clinical professionals (no traditional practitioners, families or other community). Report to Governor SB 1033 VETO Request Page \u0000 of \u000017 21\"The dangerous midwife has long been a convenient ctional gure of misogyny and societal control all over the world. She goes back to the witch hunts of the Inquisition. and is akin to the construed \"welfare queen\" of modern political yarns. Exaggeration and invention follows her everywhere.\" App 6-213. A \"Midwifery Working Group\" was created by the \"Collaborative.\" Participants were ACOG, the Chair of DCCA, the ACNM, the MIH Collaborative, Hawaii Pacic Health, DOH, Healthcare Association of Hawaii, HMSA, Hawaii State Center for Nursing, and MAH (no traditional practitioners, families or other community were included). 4. In 2017 and 2018 this \"working group\" held several private meetings and one public meeting. These were not made known to the community. 5. in December 2018, a single discussion was held in which some community members were invited to attend. They were given no actual input or time for discussion. There was a request to work on building comprehensive solutions, but this was not done, except for a small \"problem solving\" gesture in the last ve minutes of the meeting. An extension of time was requested for this, but the meeting ended ve minutes later, and no further time was scheduled. This was the only known participation of any community member outside of the all-medical/clinical \"Working Group\". In other words, the entire process lacked community participation and input entirely. Much of the birth/midwifery community was shocked that this had been taking place without their knowledge. 5. It was widely and incorrectly told to legislators that a Working Group inclusive of community voices had helped to create this measure. The birth community and some legislators asserted that SB 1033 needed more community discussion, and that rather than impose a restrictive law prematurely without community input, comprehensive solutions should be developed. However, this was rejected by legislators, under the incorrect assertion that there had already been a community Working Group process. The legislature was essentially lied to in order to create special interest legislation. 7. MYTH: SB 1033 is needed because a better bill is not possible. FACT: A better bill is not only possible, but necessary. It should be noted that creating a better bill through the process in SB 1033 will not work. If SB 1033 passes into law, protest and litigation are likely, as these would be the only way to address the Constitutional violations and discrimination inherent in the measure. These processes, though necessary for the protection of basic human rights, civil rights, reproductive rights and cultural rights in the case of such deep injustice, would make it very difcult to simultaneously work on legislative efforts to remedy the disaster that SB 1033 created, especially as these efforts are clearly unlikely to succeed, as there would be no motivation on the part of the regulatory interests within the legislature, as evidenced by the swift passage of this bill itself, to protect these rights at all. The truth is that there has never been an opportunity to work together. Since 2014, our community has been embattled over terrible legislation, leaving us no opportunity to focus on the creation of real solutions. Fortunately, several legislators have now recognized this measure for what it is, and have offered to introduce an effective bill (see p.6) in the next session. This would be supported by the Commission on the Status of Women, and many other prominent voices. However, these legislators too recognize that these efforts would be likely to be futile if SB 1033 passes into law, as we would be starting from an extreme decit. The ONLY way to achieve true safety for out-of-hospital births in Hawaii is a VETO on SB 1033. Mahalo nui loa.

A film by Steph Smith, 2019.http:// www.givelight.info/midwivesandexperts Please \u0000 of \u000021 21 App 6-25Aloha Kakou, We, as representatives of traditional cultural and spiritual birthing practices in Hawaii, would like to offer the following comments to the Report to the Governor and the Legislature by the Hawaii Home Birth Task Force under Act 32. We deeply appreciate the work of all who participated in this process. This Task Force brought together many extremely different viewpoints, and laid a foundation for important communication in the future. Everyone who participated in its work did so with diligence, sincerity and aloha. We thank everyone for their tremendous efforts. There is still much work to be done. We as traditional practitioners do not feel that our practices are adequately protected. In truth, Act 32 represents persecution of our ways, which have come from our ancestors, and belong to our daughters and granddaughters. These fragile ancient practices require the protection of all of the midwives of the entire community, all of whom have an important role in perpetuating and revitalizing ancient cultural practices that were nearly decimated by the modernization of medical birth in the past century. A'ohe pau ka ike i ka hlau ho okahi This well-known lelo noeau tells us that not all knowledge is taught in one school. In the context of midwifery regulation it is important to remember that there are many kinds of intelligence and many ways of knowing. Creating one pathway to licensure without exemption criminalizes those who perpetuate the other kinds of knowledge. Hawaii is heading towards a dynamic and innovative future of economic and cultural abundance. Creating legislation which threatens to make some kinds of knowledge extinct counters that progress. The more diversity in knowledge the more resilient a community is. We appreciate the inclusion of indigenous peoples of all origins in the Task Force's recommendations for exemption from Act 32. The practices of Kanaka Maoli, the indigenous people of Hawaii, are complemented by the continued traditional practices of other cultures and spiritual practices. Samoan birthing practices, Filipino birthing practices, European birthing traditions, African-American birthing traditions, and the practices of many spiritual and religious birthing ways have all helped to support the revitalization of Kanaka birthing ways; likewise, the host Kanaka Maoli culture provides an important connection to land and history that has been crucial for the rights of traditional practices of all lands to flourish. Harm to any part of this network of tradition is harm to all of it. We strongly recommend that the legislature take the recommendation to exempt traditional practitioners of all cultures and spiritual traditions to heart, and act accordingly. We would like to note that the other recommendations also affect traditional cultural practices. Access to reasonable training pathways of all kinds is crucial in completing the full spectrum of App 6-26traditional practices, which range from strictly ancient to contemporary. The revitalization and perpetuation of cultures depends upon the health of this entire spectrum. While there are parts of this report that we would very much like to see strengthened in real protection of our traditions and our rights, we stand by the hard-earned consensus represented here. We are disappointed that the constituencies of some member agencies opposed the findings of the Task Force. This was rather shocking, after all of the work that was put into building consensus at the table. From this, we take the lesson that greater communication is essential going forward. In response to those who repeatedly thwart the collaboration process we offer this variation on the lelo noeau above: A'ohe pau ka ike i ku hlau It tells us that not all knowledge is taught in YOUR school. We are living in a time of global de-colonization and Hawaii is on the forefront. Believing that the only valuable knowledge is that which is taught at your school is the definition of colonization, an archaic mentality of the last century. Tolerance, flexibility and understanding are the only ways for us to evolve forward and keep up with the times we are living in. In summary, we support the recommendations provided to exempt and protect all traditional birthing practices of all kinds, in accordance with the rights articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the United Nations Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples (UNDRIP). Me ke aloha aia Halau O Haumea Na Pua O Haumea Hale Hoolana Island Inspired Therapies Ka Womens Health Collective Wahine Hoopaa Ka P Ehu O Waiola Nawahineakauhiakama App 6-27To: Ms. Kristie Duarte, Chair and Public Member, Hawai`i Home Birth Task Force From: Midwife Mieko Aoki, CPM, Kaua`i, Member, Hawai`i ForceDate: December 6, 2019 Re: Homebirth Midwife/CPM response to Hawaii Home Birth Task Force RecommendationsDear Ms. Duarte,Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed amendments to Act 32. Regulating Direct Entry Midwives (DEM) is an important topic to me as I am a DEM who has gone through the process of becoming a Certied Professional Midwife (CPM). I support the amendments recommended by the Hawai`i home birth task force as it is based on how best DEMs can practice and function transparently. Homebirth Midwife recommendations on home birth ethics & care are based on direct experience & evidence and are not simple opinions, such may be from distinct medical organizations. Homebirth Midwives have and offer their experience, expertise, skills, time and love to: mindfully assist in physiological labor and with truly minimal interventions at birth attend to maternal, newborn and family needs support the mother in emotional, mental, physical, spiritual realms be present for individual maternal & newborn care with ample time and compassion nurture the relationship between mother and midwife build a trusting bond between mother, family and midwife listen to maternal & midwife's instincts and intuitions full access and transparency to informed consent (responsibility) educate in nutrition, any health conditions and decision making (accountability) heal their traumatic hospital birth experiences and bullying obstetrical care (treatable conditions gone lethal, unprepared for emergency, etc.) heal their unnecessary traumatic cesarean birth experiences (home birth after cesarean) heal their abandoned postpartum period (postpartum care for mother and newborn) Homebirth Midwives attend to the mother in supportive birthing positions, private location of choice and when it is time to birth. Home has always been the place of birth since the beginning of time and is the safest feeling for most mothers to birth at. ACOG's belief that hospitals are safest is a matter of inexperienced opinion (class C) in home birth and is not based on evidence-based research. There is a private contract between mother and midwife where an agreement is made in conscious comprehensive conversation to begin the relationship. It is the mother's responsibility to ask questions and to inquire about anything of the Homebirth Midwife of their choice. It is the App 6-28Homebirth Midwife's responsibility to respond and to disclose any information that is being sought. This type of relationship is vital to the well-being of the mother and child, and is primarily built on trust, transparency and accountability. Homebirth Midwives come in all shapes, forms, colors and sizes. Our path to becoming a Homebirth Midwife are variable and unique. Apprenticeship paths are powerful and rooted in direct home birth life experience. Academic programs are rich in science & research and also participates in an apprenticeship. There is traditions in many midwives practices and that is to be honored and upheld independently. Culture is rooted in many generations and signies identity, customs, rituals, beliefs in midwifery practices and is to be honored and respected. Western medical education is also available for nurse-midwives who have options to attend home births after training in hospitals. The various routes and times in each Homebirth Midwives education is nonetheless equally profound and all can be perpetuated. The public, primarily Home Birthing mothers who have had obstetrical/hospital care, have repeatedly made comments that they detest, despise, dislike, shudder at, feel aversion to obstetrical care and protocolized care given at the hospital. Some opinions of obstetricians have been that they had to \"x\" a homebirth transfer to the hospital. Homebirth Midwives evidence has been that we had to \"x\" the long-term trauma induced by obstetrical care and hospital policies. Recommendations for ACOG and HAH are to focus on reducing the rapid rise in US maternal mortality rates that rank 24th in the developed nations in 2015 (10.3 in 1991, 23.8 in 2014, 26.4 in 2015 of deaths per 100,000 live births), rather than restricting consumers' choice under the guise of safety by limiting availability of Homebirth Midwives through restrictive licensure. And two-thirds of these deaths were considered preventable! The US is the only developed nation that increased in maternal mortality with the most expensive healthcare system. https:// www.npr.org/2017/05/12/528098789/u-s-has-the-worst-rate-of-maternal-deaths-in-the- developed-world Recommendations for ACOG and HAH to reconsider protocols that promote to sacrice the freedom of consumers to make an informed choice by protecting hospital and medical industry or obstetricians. Is it in the consumer's interest if you sacrice their freedom of choice in the intention of keeping them safe? Recommendation for obstetricians is to attend normal physiological undisturbed labor & birth at home before providing any recommendations for home birth midwives. Recommendation for HAH: 1. Push contracted health plans to create strong incentives for health care providers to charge a single \"bundled\" price for the entire episode of maternity care. Since C-sections cost more than App 6-29vaginal deliveries, a bundled payment would give providers an incentive to avoid unnecessary Cesarean births. 2. Demand that health plans require participating hospitals to follow best evidence-based practices. https://hbr.org/2019/06/the-rising-u-s-maternal-mortality-rate-demands-action-from-employers Home birth Midwife Mieko Aoki, CPM supports the Hawai`i Home Birth Task Force recommendations and advises the legislature to strongly adhere to these recommendations. Thank you for your dedication and commitment to the Task Force and for your leadership as Task Force Chair. Sincerely, Mieko Aoki, CPM Home Birth Midwife, Kaua`i App 6-30 App Kristie Duarte Chair and Public Member, Hawai 'i Home Birth Task Force DATE: November 4, Hawai i Re: ACOG Response to Hawaii Home Birth Task Force Recommendations Dear Ms. Duarte: The Hawaii Section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (HI ACOG) represents more than 200 obstetrician/gynecologist physicians in our state. We thank you for the opportunity to participate in and provide comments on the report from the Hawai i Home Birth Task Force regarding Act 32. We appreciate the shared concerns of other task force members regarding the safety of birth in Hawai i while still supporting a woman's choice. The College believes that hospitals and accredited birth centers are the safest settings for birth, and each woman has the right to make a medically informed decision about delivery . We believe that women should be informed that several factors are critical to reducing perinatal mortality and achieving favorable home birth outcomes. These factors include the appropriate selection of candidates for home birth; the availability of a certified nurse- midwife, certified midwife or midwife whose education and licensure meet International Confederation of Midwives' (ICM) Global Standards for Midwifery Education, or physician practicing obstetrics within an integrated and regulated health system; ready access to consultation; and access to safe and timely transport to a hospital. The Committee on Obstetric Practice considers fetal malpresentation, multiple gestation, or prior cesarean delivery to be an absolute contraindication to planned home birth. https://www.acog.org/- /media/Committee- Opinions/Committee- on-Obstetric - Practice/co697.pdf?dmc=1&ts=20191105T0635572563 In April 2015, ACOG endorsed the ICM education and training standards and strongly advocates the ICM criteria as a baseline for midwife licensure in the United States. The ICM definitions are accepted throughout the world across 6 regions, by over 130 member organizations and by all U.S. midwifery professional organizations. Women in every state should be guaranteed care that meets these important minimum standards. Hawai i should uphold the standards of midwifery care expected by women in other nations around the world. Unfortunately, the Task Force Proposal for the education and training of \"direct -entry midwives\" does not adhere to the ICM standards. ICM's baseline midwifery education standards include: o curriculum is a minimum of 40% theory and 50% practice o minimum length of direct -entry education is 3 years o minimum length of post -nursing education is 18 months o faculty is formally prepared to teach American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists District VIII, Hawaii (Guam & American Samoa) Section App 6-36o time limited certification o certifying body should not simultaneously define/validate education and develop/administer exam o defined continued education requirements o periodic external review of education program effectiveness In addition, the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) Portfolio Evaluation Process (PEP) does not meet international standards as the apprenticeship programs lack accreditation. ACOG does support the \"bridge certificate\" program as a grandmothering in pathway for certified professional midwife applicants who have been credentialed prior to January 1, 2020 through non- accredited apprenticeship programs. ACOG supports requiring all midwife providers certifying on or after January 1, 2020 to have completed an accredited education that meets ICM education and training standards. Hawai i ACOG advocates for implementation of the ICM standards to ensure all women have access to safe, qualified, highly skilled providers in all settings . Sincerely, Chrystie K. Fujimoto, MD, FACOG ACOG Hawai i Section Chair App 6-37To: Kristie Duarte, Hawaii Home Birth Task Force From: The Hawaii Affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives (HAA). Date: October 25, 2019 Re: Task Force Report. HAA is on record in whole-hearted support of families ' choices for safe, high quality care, home birth, and the midwifery model of care. In consultation with the State Government Affairs Consultant of the American College of Nurse-Midwives, HAA opposes the Hawaii Home Birth Task Force's Recommendation VI. A., to remove the International Confederation of Midwives and US MERA language, definitions, and standards from Act 32. Consequently, HAA cannot support the additional recommendations of the Task Force. We recognize the lack of midwifery education and midwife preceptors as a contributing factor to li miting access to care. We hope that future initiatives focus on this issue. Additional comment: HAA notes that the opinions of the certified nurse-midwife who served on the Task Force are her own, and they are not in alignment with the official position of HAA. HAA only learned about the Task Force meetings and this report 4 days before final comments on the draft were due. HAA would have willingly sent a CNM representative actively involved in homebirth practice to join the Task Force, since HAA represents the perspectives of CNMs who provide home birth care in Hawaii. We are committed to excellence in midwifery and believe that the people of Hawaii should have access to pregnancy and birth care that is safe and satisfying at home, in birth centers or hospitals.

ACT 032(19) Sincerely, DAVID Y. IGE Governor, State of Hawai'i Appendix 7 - Act 32, SLH 2019 App 7-11 Approved by the Governor on __ AP_R_..._1 ........ 0 ......... 201 ........ 9 _ THE SENATE THIRTIETH LEGISLATURE, 2019 STATE OF HAWAII ACT 032 S.B. NO. A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO THE LICENSURE OF MIDWIVES. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HA WAIi: PART I 1033 S.D.2 H.D.2 2 SECTION 1. As determined by Senate Concurrent Resolution 3 No. 64, S.D.1 (1998), subsequent Auditor's Report No. 99-14 4 (1999), House Concurrent Resolution No. 65, H.D.1 (2016), and 5 the subsequent Auditor's Report No. 17-01 (2017), the 6 legislature finds that it is necessary to establish a mandatory 7 regulatory process for the midwifery profession. 8 Hawaii regulated midwifery starting with registration in 9 1931, which progressed into certification and then licensure. 10 However, the regulation of midwifery was repealed in 1998 when 11 nurse-midwives were placed under the purview of the board of 12 nursing. Since 1998, there has been a lapse in regulation, yet 13 individuals in the community have continued to practice 14 midwifery and offer birth services to the public. 15 The legislature finds that mothers and families seek out 16 alternatives to hospital births and they find significant value 17 in community or home birth services. These services are SB1033 HD2 HMS 2019-3746 S.D.2 H.D .. 2 1 currently provided by individuals identifying themselves as 2 traditional or cultural practitioners, midwives, certified 3 professional midwives, lay midwives, direct entry midwives, 4 birth keepers, or birth attendants. This Act will continue to 5 allow a woman to choose where and with whom she gives.birth. 6 The legislature further finds that the profession of 7 midwifery has continued to evolve since the lapse in regulation. 8 Common definitions, training, and competency standards for the 9 practice of midwifery have developed on both a global and 10 national level. However, not all practitioners easily fit into 11 these definitions, categories, and standards. Hawaii currently 12 has many individuals offering birth services under different 13 titles and at varying levels of competency and training. 14 The legislature further finds the term \"midwife\" connotes 15 an expectation of a minimum level of care by consumers and the 16 community. The Hawaii regulatory licensing reform act requires 17 the State to regulate professions or vocations where the health, 18\" safety, or welfare of the consumer may be jeopardized by the 19 nature of the service offered by the provider. The practice of 20 midwifery meets these criteria, and, therefore, must be 21 regulated by the State. SB1033 HD2 HMS 2019-3746 lllillllllHIDlllllllll~IIII 2 App 7-3Page3 ,S.B. NO. 1 The purpose of this Act is to resolve the lapse in 1033 S.D. 2 H.D. 2 2 regulation of midwifery and to regulate midwives engaged in the 3 practice of midwifery by establishing licensure and regulatory 4 requirements under the department of commerce and consumer 5 affairs. This Act also exempts a separate category of birth 6 attendants for a three-year period, to allow this community to 7 define themselves and develop common standards, accountability 8 measures, and disclosure requirements. By the end of the three- 9 year period, the legislature intends to enact statutes that will 10 incorporate all birth practitioners and allow them to practice 11 to the fullest extent under the law. The legislature also notes 12 that practicing midwifery according to this Act does not impede 13 one's ability to incorporate or provide cultural practices. 14 SECTION 2. The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by 15 adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read 16 as follows: 17 \"CHAPTER 18 MIDWIVES 19 \u00a7 -1 Findings and The legislature finds that: SB1033 HD2 HMS 2019-3746 ll~illl!~IIIH~l~~lll~Hllllllll~lilllmH~I 3 App 7-4Page 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 S.B.
