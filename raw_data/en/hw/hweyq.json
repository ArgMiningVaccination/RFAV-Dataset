Unlike the whole 5G conspiracy theory, this one - namely, that there may be a link between immunity from COVID-19 and the vaccine, which was developed to protect against tuberculosis - does have scientific underpinnings. What happened is this. Researchers at the [The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) in the US found that deaths from COVID-19 are almost six times lower in countries that use the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) jab in their vaccination programmes. They decided to examine this idea as a result of two recent studies suggesting a link between BCG vaccination policy and deaths from COVID-19. Their findings, it's important to note, are yet to be peer reviewed and therefore cannot be used to guide any sort of clinical practice. As such, they have been published on [online archive MedRxiv,](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20053272v1) rather than in an academic journal. Currently, two clinical trails devoted to decoding the findings are underway, [according to](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/bacille-calmette-gu%C3%A9rin-(bcg)-vaccination-and-covid-19) the World Health Organisation (WHO.) What is the BCG vaccine? The Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine is used to protect against tuberculosis, known as TB, a contagious, bacterial infection that can most commonly affects the lungs but can also affect the bones, joints and kidneys. Mass BCG vaccination [was dropped in 2005 in the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jul/06/schools.education) for children age 10-14 thanks to falling rates of tuberculosis infection. (If you went to school before then, you may well remember receiving the injection.) This means that it's not a part of the routine [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/bcg-tuberculosis-tb-vaccine/) vaccination programme, and so is only only given to children or adults who are at increased risk of coming into contact with TB. What is the link between the BCG vaccine and Coronavirus? The research from John Hopkins looked at mortality rates in the top 50 countries affected by the novel coronavirus and found a link between lower death rates and a widespread vaccination programme that includes the BCG jab. 'Covid-19-attributable mortality among BCG-using countries was 5.8 times lower than in non BCG-using countries,' academics noted in the paper. [Dr Andrew Preston](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/andrew-preston), an academic in the Department of Biology and Biochemistry at the University of Bath, told WH: 'Two reports have made associations between the use of a BCG vaccine and reduced COVID fatality. The studies attempted to account for other factors at play, including population size and socioeconomic status of different countries. 'The idea is that although the BCG vaccine is used to protect against TB, it has some general effects on the immune system, including boosting anti-viral responses.' Is the BCG vaccine proven to protect against Coronavirus? In short, no. Dr Preston says: 'To demonstrate a cause and effect for BCG vaccination, a controlled trial is required that can properly eliminate other factors. 'Two trials have been registered to test the effect of BCG vaccination, but data from these will not be available for several months at the earliest. 'In the meantime, the WHO caution that there is no evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of BCG vaccination against COVID disease severity.' A [statement](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/bacille-calmette-gu%C3%A9rin-(bcg)-vaccination-and-covid-19) from the WHO says: 'There is no evidence that the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine (BCG) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus.' It continues: 'In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19.' How long will it be until we have a Coronavirus vaccine? New vaccines can take months or even years to develop. However, given the severity of coronavirus, the UK government hopes it will have access to a vaccine [sooner rather than later](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/conditions/a32067297/when-will-coronavirus-end/). 'For COVID, there is clearly an acute need for the vaccine to be introduced as soon as possible, but its hugely important to balance safety and efficacy with speed,' says Dr Preston. Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, told [the Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-by-september-flmwl257x) that a vaccine could be ready as early as September, but the official line from government experts such as Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty is that the vaccine may not be ready this year. However, [Public Health England](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/phe-plays-crucial-role-in-hunt-for-covid-19-vaccine) will soon start evaluation of the Oxford University COVID-19 vaccine that could potentially enter clinical trials in the next month or so. 'Attempts are being made to shorten each phase of development to the minimum. Animal testing is running parallel to the initial human safety testing,' continues Dr Preston. 'Even so, there is a limit to how quickly a vaccine can make it through testing and manufacturing, so the autumn is the earliest that any of the groups involved have identified as the point at which a vaccine might be ready, and even then, it might have to be a phased roll-out.'
