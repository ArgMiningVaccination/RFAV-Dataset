Why do we need vaccinations? Vaccines save lives. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that vaccines save 2-3 million lives worldwide every year. In the past 50 years, vaccines have saved more lives in Canada than any other medical intervention. Vaccines protect against more than 25 debilitating or life-threatening diseases, including measles, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, meningitis, influenza, tetanus, typhoid and cervical cancer. Vaccines prevent outbreaks. Cases of diseases that can be prevented with vaccines have decreased over the years. Yet, the pathogens that cause these diseases still exist. Vaccination rates must remain high until diseases are completely eliminated to protect ourselves. Vaccines are an important part of herd immunity. Herd immunity or indirect protection from infectious diseases is achieved through vaccination. The majority of the population needs to be vaccinated and immune to infectious diseases to limit the spread of pathogens. Learning resources - It can be difficult to understand the importance of vaccines and how you can access them. [This recorded webinar](https://wpl.ubc.ca/browse/wellbeing/wellness/ubc-wellbeing/courses/wpl-wb-vac)for faculty and staff from the UBC Pharmacists Clinic and Human Resources covers the immune system, how vaccines work, vaccine safety, introduction to COVID-19 vaccines, and navigating the resources available to you. - There are certain vaccines that are recommended for all adults. Learn more about the vaccines and most recent recommendations on [ImmunizeBC website](https://immunizebc.ca/adults). [A schedule and cost of recommended vaccines](//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://immunizebc.ca/sites/default/files/docs/vaccine-schedule-recommended-adults-2021.pdf)is a useful tool to understand when and why you might need a certain vaccine. Some of the recommended vaccines are publicly funded and free to you, while others may need to be purchased. COVID-19 vaccines At this time, UBC does not provide COVID-19 vaccinations directly to faculty and staff, but we can assist you in finding the information you need. You can also find more helpful information about vaccines on the [UBC COVID-19 page](https://covid19.ubc.ca/health-guidance-and-vaccines/#faq-vaccines). Canada's vaccination program has made tremendous progress in the fight against COVID-19. The [approved COVID-19 vaccines](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/plan#canada) are being rolled out across B.C. as we speak, and everyone aged 6 months and older in BC can now register to get vaccinated. UBC encourages all members of our community to support the provincial vaccine program. Vaccines are the best way to protect yourself - and everyone around you - from COVID-19.
