I hope that you will join us on the active conversations of our listserv and learn from our colleagues. Also, don 't hesitate to post any questions you may have so that you can benefit from the wisdom of our group. As a follow -up to the email I sent to all SOIM members at the start of the New Year, the SOIM Executive Committee (EC), with the help of our AAP Manager Teri Salus, has now \"opened \" the revised SOIM web- site within the AAP website. Everything had to be rebuilt and we are still in the process of adding con- tent, but this is a start. To access the website, go to https://www.aap.org/en -us/about -the -aap/Sections/ Section -on-Integrative -Medicine/Pages/SOIM.aspx . From there, click on \"My Collaboration Sites \", log in with your AAP login, and then click on \"Section of Integrative Medicine \". Again, this is currently \"bare bones \" but we are working on adding content. What would you find helpful on this site? Please give us your feedback ( tsalus@aap.org ). A few of us recently attended the AAP Annual Leadership Forum (ALF) where new policies are proposed, debated, and then voted on to be brought forth to the AAP Board for consideration for action. What was apparent to us representing SOIM was the relative lack of evidence -based integrative therapies offered within these and other policies \u2014most notably the recent policy statement on pain management in children. Because of this concern, the SOIM EC is working on an ALF proposal advocating that all AAP Policy Sta te- ments, Clinical Statements, and Technical Reports include evidence -based integrative strategies. Our proposal will be submitted early Fall 2019 for consideration at the Spring 2020 ALF. That being said, members of the EC have reached out to and are working with other sections and committees within the AAP who are in the process of policy reviews to add integrative content. Some of the current projects include addressing pain in sick le-cell disease, sensory processing disorders, and an ADHD tool kit, to name a few. We will keep you informed on the progress of thes e en- deavors. Blessings to you all! THE SECTION ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE Meaning and Purpose: Burnout and Resilience Hilary McClafferty, MD, FAAP Past Chair, Section on Integrative Medicine Like many of you, my work life has changed significantly over the years. These transitions have reinforced my conviction that a strong sense of meaning and purpose are integral to a sustainable career in medicine. Take a moment to consider your current feeling of meaning and purpose at work. Where would you fall on an informal scale of 1 -10, with 10 being a high sense of meaning and purpose on most days? If you fall in the upper range, say 7 -10, that is a tremendous accomplishment and a powerful buffer against burnout. What are those things that are bringing you meaning and joy, providing you energy to meet the challenges of the day? Write them down. These are your guideposts. If you are on the lower end of the scale, say less than 5, when was the last time you did have a strong sense of meaning and purpose at work? What work were you were doing? Which specific elements deeply reso- nated with you then? What fueled your sense of purpose? Write it down - these are your bread crumbs. When you think about that prior sense of purpose and direction, what is different now? Elements that may have changed include the actual job you were performing, and also the setting, the people, your support system, technology, time constraints, call schedule, sleep schedule and so on. Once you have identified some of the differences between then and now, write them down. These are your clues: potential obstacles, speed bumps, closed doors blocking your way to regaining meaning and pur- pose in your work life. The next important question to ask when considering your perceived obstacles is this, which elements of the situation are actually in your control and which are not? Research shows that a strong sense of 'locus of control ', i.e., an inner 'can -do' perspective, is a recognized trait of highly resilient people.1 It is not that these people don 't recognize the obstacle, it is that they simul- taneously recognize it, maintain an attitude of realistic optimism, and begin to problem solve without fear of failure. One of things I 've observed when talking with some colleagues about burnout is a profound sense of loss of control, a feeling that medicine has changed for the worse and there is little they can do about it. This con- AAP SOIM Newsletter \u2014 Spring 2019 Page 2 THE SECTION ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE Meaning and Purpose: Burnout and Resilience Continued from Page 2 AAP SOIM Newsletter \u2014 Spring 2019 Page 3 cerns me because I have seen many colleagues make deep and significant shifts in their outlook, turn events in their favor, seek out new opportunities, connect with broader networks and open doors to solutions not previ- ously considered. If you need to refuel your sense of meaning in medicine, it may be worthwhile examining an area where you feel stymied, stuck, or stagnant. Take some time to consider these questions: Can you clearly bring to mind a time you felt a strong sense of meaning and purpose at work? Which elements resonated with you then? If you 've lost your sense of purpose, what is different now? Does the change involve elements that are, in fact, in your control? If so, focus on one small area where you can realistically make a change. Then make it. Each time you follow the breadcrumbs and act, whether it 's a step towards physical self -care or in seeking out a new job opportunity, you enhance your inner locus of control, refining a perspective that will help you reengage with the powerful sense of purpose that drew you to medicine in the first place, providing welcome relief from feeling burned out, off course, and out of control. _______________________________ 1 Stress in America: Paying with Our Health.
