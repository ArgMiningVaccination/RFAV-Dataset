These methods were based on the belief that the energy zones in the feet are connected to internal organs. Both Chinese and Japanese cultures believed that you could cleanse the entire body by extracting accumulated toxins via the soles of the feet. In addition to cleansing toxins from your system, all of these foot remedies to detox your body are very relaxing. Pampering your feet is a fantastic way to alleviate stress and unwind after a long day. Your feet are an important component of your overall health. Taking care of your feet properly is one of the first steps in an overall health plan. Soak your feet in warm water to open the pores. Add 1 cup of sea salt, 1 cup of Epsom salt and 2 cups of baking soda to the water. Dissolve all ingredients in boiling water and, when the water cools to a comfortable level, soak your feet for 30 minutes. In addition to toxic relief, this bath will help fight body aches and tiredness and increase magnesium levels. Fill your foot tub with hot water. Add 2 cups of hydrogen peroxide and 1 tablespoon of dried ginger powder. Stir the water to mix the ingredients and then soak your feet for 30 minutes. This is a great bath to treat irritations and allergies as well as remove toxins from your body. Pour hot water into a foot tub. Add 1/2 cup of Epsom salt and allow it to dissolve. Prepare a mixture of 1/2 cup of [bentonite clay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentonite) and water, then add it to the Epsom salt bath. Soak your feet for 20 minutes to heighten the level of magnesium in your body and remove toxins. You can purchase foot detox pads from a variety of online stores. You will need to follow the directions for the specific product but, in general, you place them on the soles of your feet before you go to bed and remove them in the morning.
