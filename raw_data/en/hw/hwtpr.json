She is the oldest in my mom's family and likes to make this dessert whenever there are gatherings at her house.

It is strong, with lots of flavour, and you can adjust the chilli content to make it as spicy as you wish. This can be served as a main dish with tortillas and sour cream or as a side with grilled steak or chicken.
