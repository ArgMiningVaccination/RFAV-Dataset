PicnicHealth \"BrainPower\" Pan-Neuroscience Patient Experience Research Genentech is initiating a neuroscience research study called BrainPower (Brain Patient Outcomes With Experience Research), an expansion of our five-year partnership with a patient-centered medical records healthcare technology company, PicnicHealth, to analyze longitudinal, real-world clinical data of people living with neurologic diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (EMPOWER AD), Myasthenia gravis (MG), and MS to identify common data trends and understand shared patient challenges across neurological disorders. This further builds on previously announced neuroscience partnerships in MS and Huntington's disease. Details on the EMPOWER AD study with PicnicHealth will be shared in an [oral presentation](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aan.com%2FMSA%2FPublic%2FEvents%2FAbstractDetails%2F54139&esheet=53385597&newsitemid=20230424005241&lan=en-US&anchor=oral+presentation&index=3&md5=4cdaf9fb8798e91f7fe48f4f9f214475) on Monday, April 24 at 8:00 a.m. ET. \"Social determinants of health impact quality of life, outcomes and overall health, and we are acutely aware of the disparities and inequities they perpetuate across neurological disorders -- particularly in the United States. We are partnering with the leading minds in healthcare technology, telehealth, inclusive research and evidence generation to identify barriers and co-create solutions with the neurology community to facilitate equitable healthcare delivery,\" said Gregory A. Rippon, M.D., M.S., F.A.A.N., Vice President and Chief Medical Partner, Neurology. \"Our hope is to help people living with neurological disorders preserve their health, independence, and what makes them uniquely who they are - and that will only be possible when every person not only receives a transformative treatment, but also receives the same quality of care, regardless of their zip code, income or background.\" Cleveland Clinic Neurology Telehealth Pilot Telehealth is an accessible option for a variety of patients, including those living in rural areas, facing barriers to healthcare access, who are immunocompromised or could face issues with an in-person setting (e.g., due to financial or mobility challenges). Neurology practices saw one of the highest uptake rates for ambulatory telemedicine (nearly half of total visits) during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cleveland Clinic and Genentechestablished a research collaboration in 2022 to better understand the utilization of telehealth in nearly 200,000 people living with neurological conditions (MS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), and impact on access to care, clinical outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization within Cleveland Clinic's health system. We hope to understand patient barriers to facilitate more equitable healthcare delivery, particularly among underserved minority communities, older and lower socioeconomic status individuals and people living in rural areas.

Longer-term data to be presented at AAN to reinforce importance of early treatment and slowing disease activity and progression in MS, NMOSD and SMA Across neurological disorders the main goal of treatment is to prevent disease progression to ultimately preserve function. Genentech will present 33 abstracts, including new long-term data for market leading Ocrevus in MS and Evrysdi in SMA, including: - The Phase III OPERA I/II and Phase IIIb ENSEMBLE trials highlight the importance of early treatment with Ocrevus, with new 8.5- and 9-year follow-up data from the Phase III OPERA I/II trials in relapsing MS (RMS), which significantly slows disease activity and disability progression - an important goal in MS. Also presented for Ocrevus will be new four-year data from the Phase IIIb ENSEMBLE trial demonstrating minimal disease activity in newly diagnosed patients living with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). Ocrevus is the #1 prescribed MS medicine in the US, and more than 300,000 patients globally have been treated with Ocrevus. See AAN oral session presentation details on Ocrevus sessions [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aan.com%2Fmsa%2Fpublic%2Fevents%2Findex%2F45&esheet=53385597&newsitemid=20230424005241&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=5&md5=d96c62bc2841e7d8fb4234ed5bb99f1d). - Data from three studies reinforce the longer-term efficacy and safety of Evrysdi for people living with SMA across a broad range of ages, disease severities and treatment histories, including: three-year data from the FIREFISH study in infants with Type 1 SMA showing improvements in survival and reaching motor milestones, four-year data from the SUNFISH study in people aged 2 to 25 years with Types 2 or 3 SMA with sustained motor function and a decreased rate of adverse events, and two-year data from the JEWELFISH study in people with SMA aged 6 months to 60 years who initially received other investigational or approved SMA therapies, which showed maintenance of motor function. Without treatment, children with Type 1 SMA are never able to sit without support and natural history data show that patients with Type 2 or 3 SMA typically show a decline in motor function over time. More than 8,500 people globally \u2014 from newborns to those over 60 \u2014 have been treated with Evrysdi, which is now approved in more than 95 countries worldwide. See AAN oral session presentation details on Evrysdi sessions [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aan.com%2Fmsa%2Fpublic%2Fevents%2Findex%2F45&esheet=53385597&newsitemid=20230424005241&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=6&md5=83a415fd5fecbca627a1651758336a68).

About Genentech in Neuroscience Neuroscience is a major focus of research and development at Genentech. Our goal is to pursue groundbreaking science to develop new treatments that help improve the lives of people with chronic and potentially devastating diseases. Genentech and Roche are investigating more than a dozen medicines for neurological disorders, including MS, SMA, NMOSD, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's, Acute ischemic stroke, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Angelman syndrome. Together with our partners, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of scientific understanding to solve some of the most difficult challenges in neuroscience today. About Ocrevus\u00ae (ocrelizumab) Ocrevus is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS (including RRMS and active, or relapsing, secondary progressive MS [SPMS], in addition to clinically isolated syndrome [CIS] in the U.S.) and PPMS. Ocrevus is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to target CD20-positive B cells, a specific type of immune cell thought to be a key contributor to myelin (nerve cell insulation and support) and axonal (nerve cell) damage. This nerve cell damage can lead to disability in people with MS. Based on preclinical studies, Ocrevus binds to CD20 cell surface proteins expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells, suggesting that important functions of the immune system may be preserved. Ocrevus is administered by intravenous infusion every six months. The initial dose is given as two 300 mg infusions given two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as single 600 mg infusions. About Enspryng\u00ae(satralizumab-mwge) Enspryng, which was designed by Chugai, a member of the Roche Group, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor activity. The cytokine IL-6 is believed to be a key driver in NMOSD disease processes, triggering the inflammation cascade and leading to damage and disability. Enspryng was designed using novel recycling antibody technology. When compared to conventional antibodies, Enspryng's recycling antibody technology enables the medicine to remain in the bloodstream for a longer period of time and bind repeatedly to its target (the IL-6 receptor) - maximally sustaining IL-6 suppression in a chronic disease like NMOSD and enabling subcutaneous dosing every four weeks. Positive Phase III results for Enspryng, as both monotherapy and in combination with baseline immunosuppressive therapy, suggest that IL-6 inhibition is an effective therapeutic approach for NMOSD who are AQP4-IgG seropositive. The Phase III clinical development program for Enspryng includes two studies: SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky. Enspryng is currently approved in 80 countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea and the European Union. Enspryng has been designated as an orphan drug in the United States, Europe, Japan and Russia. In addition, it was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of NMOSD by the FDA in December 2018, which is given to treatments that may demonstrate substantial improvement over other available options. About Evrysdi\u00ae (risdiplam) [Evrysdi](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evrysdi.com%2F&esheet=53385597&newsitemid=20230424005241&lan=en-US&anchor=Evrysdi&index=9&md5=2fba9edd1a492e1dae74276043e1c3f1) is a survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q that lead to survival motor neuron (SMN) protein deficiency. Evrysdi is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or by feeding tube. Evrysdi is designed to treat SMA by increasing and sustaining the production of SMN protein in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues as demonstrated in animal models. SMN protein is found throughout the body and is critical for maintaining healthy motor neurons and movement. Evrysdi was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017. In 2021, Evrysdi was awarded Drug Discovery of the Year by the British Pharmacological Society as well as the Society for Medicines Research award for Drug Discovery. Evrysdi is currently approved in more than 90 countries and the dossier is under review in a further 16 countries. Evrysdi is currently being evaluated in five multicenter trials in people with SMA: - FIREFISH (NCT02913482) - an open-label, two-part pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study in 21 infants with the primary objective of assessing the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determining the dose for Part 2. Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of risdiplam in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA treated for two years, followed by an open-label extension. Enrollment for Part 2 was completed in November 2018. The primary objective of Part 2 was to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support for 5 seconds after 12 months of treatment, as assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development - Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds). The study met its primary endpoint. - SUNFISH (NCT02908685) - a two-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal study in people aged 2-25 years with Types 2 or 3 SMA. Part 1 (n=51) determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2. Part 2 (n=180) evaluated motor function using the total score of Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) at 12 months. MFM-32 is a validated scale used to evaluate fine and gross motor function in people with neurological disorders, including SMA. The study met its primary endpoint. - JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) - an open-label exploratory trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in people with SMA aged 6 months to 60 years who received other investigational or approved SMA therapies for at least 90 days prior to receiving Evrysdi. The study has completed recruitment (n=174). - RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334) - an open-label, single-arm, multicenter the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in babies (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is fully enrolled. - MANATEE (NCT05115110) - a global Phase II/III clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GYM329 (RG6237), an anti-myostatin molecule targeting muscle growth, in combination with Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA in patients 2-25 years of age. The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development granted GYM329 Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of patients with SMA in December 2021. The study is currently recruiting.
