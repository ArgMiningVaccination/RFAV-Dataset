Such requests generally relate to chemicals for which there are incomplete,non-standard or controversial data sets for which independent authoritative advice onpotential mutagenic hazards and risks is required. Frequently recommendations forfurther studies are made. During 2003, the Committee provided advice on a wide range of chemicals which included DEET (an insect repellent), malathion (an insecticide), Flunixin (in the form of its meglumine salt) and malachite green (both used as veterinary medicines), 2-phenylphenol (a biocide) and a number of contaminants such as 1,3-dichloropropan-2-ol and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The Committee has an ongoing responsibility to provide Government Department's and Regulatory Authorities with advice on developments in procedures for the evaluation and risk assessment of mutagens.In this regard the Committee provided advice on the conduct of in-vitro mammalian cell mutation assays, the investigation of germ cell mutagens and a strategy for the assessment of the significance of in-vivomutagenicity seen at high doses in bone-marrow tests. This latter statement is particularly recommendedfor regulatory agencies who may have to assess such data. During 2003, the Committee also said farewell to three highly respected members. Professors Ashby, Cooper and Tweats have provided valuable advice to the Committee over many years. I wish to record my thanks for their scientifically excellent contribution and their commitment to public health during theirterms of office with COM. Professor P B Farmer Chair MA DPhil CChem FRSC PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:15 new in vivo mutagencity studies 2.11,3-Dichloropropan-2-ol (1,3-DCP) is a member of a group of chemicals called chloropropanols, which also includes 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol (3-MCPD) and 2,3 dichloropropan-1-ol (2,3-DCP).Chloropropanols are contaminants of some foodstuffs and of polyamine flocculants used in thetreatment of drinking water. The COM considered the mutagenicity of 1,3-DCP in 2001 and noted thatthe in-vitro data indicated that it had mutagenic potential. In the absence of any in-vivo data in mammals, it was concluded that it would be prudent to assume that 1,3-DCP was potentially genotoxicin-vivo and agreed it should be tested in-vivo using the approach set out in the COM guidelines. 2.2T wo studies, a bone marrow micronucleus assay and an unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay had been carried out to investigate the in-vivo genotoxicity of 1,3-DCP. Members discussed the results of the two new studies and considered that both assays had been conducted to relevant guidelines and thatthe results were clearly negative. In the micronucleus assay, Members noted that the PCE:NCE ratio wasvery variable amongst controls and that the top and bottom ends of the range was outside the range for historical controls. These findings were not considered to invalidate the study but Members requestedthat the contract laboratory be asked to comment on the reason for the variability. 2.3Members considered that it would be appropriate to consider these studies provided evidence that 1,3- DCP was not an in-vivo mutagen. 2.4A statement is appended at the end of this report. DEET (Diethyl-m-toluamide)2.5The COM considered the available mutagenicity data on DEET in April 2002 and concluded that whilst there were apparently no concerns regarding mutagenicity, there was a need to consider the fullreports of the two unpublished studies (carried out for the DEET Joint Venture Group), namely a metaphase assay for clastogenicity in CHO cells and an assay for UDS in rat hepatocytes. The COMconsidered these additional reports. 2.6Members noted that DEET appeared to be highly toxic in-vitro to mammalian cells in both CHO cells and rat hepatocytes and hence adequate results were only available from a relatively narrowconcentration test range in both assays. 2.7The COM concluded that there were limitations in all of the submitted studies. In particular, the COM considered that the exogenous metabolising fraction used in the in-vitro chromosome aberration assay had not produced satisfactory results with cyclophosphamide. However, overall the results of the in- vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO cells and an in-vitro UDS assay in hepatocytes were negative. This information together with the information previously reviewed by the Committee (lack of structuralalerts with DEET, negative Ames tests and negative carcinogenicity studies) suggest there is no concernwith regard to the mutagenicity of DEET. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:15 Page 1281292.8An amendment to the published statement to include this conclusion was made (http://www.doh.gov.uk/pdfs/ deetstatement.pdf.) Flunixin, meglumine and Flunixin-megulimine2.9Flunixin in the meglumine salt is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug and a non-narcotic analgesic drug with antipyretic activities. It is used in veterinary medicine (includingfood-producing animals) but it is not used in human medicine. Flunixin-meglumine dissociates in-vivo to Flunixin and meglumine. In 1997, the European Medicine Evaluation Agency's (EMEA) Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) considered the safety of Flunixin-meglumine as part of its review of old veterinary medicinal products, operating under Council Regulation 2377 /90, which covers the marketing authorisation of pharmacologically active substances used in veterinary medicines. The Food Standards Agency was concerned about the possible mutagenicity of Flunixin,meglumine and Flunixin-meglumine and asked for an opinion from the COM. 2.10 The COM considered the mutagenicity data on these compounds at meetings in 2001/2 and heard a presentation from the data holder (Schering-Plough) at the February 2003 meeting. 2.11 Most of the mutagenicity data were relatively old and had limitations. Members agreed there was no evidence to suggest that flunixin itself had mutagenic potential in-vivo but the in-vitro data were inadequate. There was limited evidence to conclude that flunixin meglumine was an in-vitro mutagen, which suggested that it was the meglumine component that was responsible for the mutagenicactivity. There was a negative in-vivo bone marrow micronucleus test with flunixin meglumine, but this study was considered too limited to allow conclusions to be drawn. Meglumine was not considered tohave any structural alerts. A positive result had been reported with meglumine itself in a bone marrowmicronucleus test. In this study involving administration of 2 doses 24 hours apart with harvest at6and 24 hours later, a positive result was produced only at the 6 hour sampling point. Negative results were also obtained in a second assay using a similar dosing schedule, but with harvest only after 24 and 48 hours. 2.12 New in-vivo micronucleus data was considered at a further meeting and agreed to be inconclusive. One study did indicate activity 6 hours after the 2 doses spaced 24 hours apart. No activity was seenat 24 hours after the second dose. The Committee noted that there was much variability in the results with individual animals, and the effects may possibly be due to toxicity. Members agreed that on thebasis of the available data, the situation regarding the in-vivo activity of meglumine was not completely resolved. 2.13 The COM considered that further studies were needed before it could be concluded that the mutagenic activity seen in-vitro with flunixin meglumine (believed to be due to the meglumine component) could be discounted. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:15 Page 129Annual Report 2003 1302.14 The presentation from the data holder and subsequent COM discussion focused on the most appropriate testing strategy given the complex set of mutagenicity data on these compounds.The data holder accepted the proposed strategy which is outlined in para 2.15 below. 2.15 The COM concluded: i. The mutagenicity data on Flunixin, Flunixin-meglumine and meglumine are relatively old and the studies have not been conducted to contemporary standards. ii. It is therefore difficult to draw any definite conclusions on the mutagenicity of these chemicals. Anumber of prudent conclusions were agreed: a. For Flunixin (a non-steroidal anti inflammatory veterinary medicine) there was limited evidence that Flunixin was mutagenic in-vitro but there was no evidence to suggest that flunixin had mutagenic potential in-vivo . Members felt the in-vitro mutagenicity data on this compound were inadequate and considered this should be raised with the CVMP. b. For Flunixin-meglumine (Flunixin in the form of the meglumine salt), there is limited evidence for a mutagenic effect in-vitro . In addition the inconclusive in-vivo data on meglumine suggest that a definite conclusion regarding flunixin-meglumine cannot be reached. c. For meglumine, the available in-vivo mutagenicity data are inconsistent with some positive and negative results. It is recommended that additional in-vitro mutagenicity tests conducted to modern standards are undertaken with meglumine to assess whether meglumine has any mutagenic potentialusing the approach recommended in the COM guidance. Negative results are available for a genemutation assay in Salmonella . Therefore these additional tests should comprise: i. An in-vitro chromosomal aberration test in mammalian cells. ii. An in-vitro mouse lymphoma assay. 2.16 A statement is appended at the end of this report. Malachite Green2.17 Malachite green is a cationic triphenylmethane dyestuff used in a number of industries, including fish farming. It is used in freshwater fisheries for the treatment of external fungal and other infections, its main use being to stop fungal growth on the eggs. The COT has asked for advice on the mutagenicityof malachite green and the lipophilic metabolite leucomalachite green. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:15 Page 1301312.18 The COM last considered the mutagenicity of malachite green and leucomalachite green in 1999. Astatement had been forwarded to the Committee on Toxicity (http://www.doh.gov.uk/ com/malachit.htm). The COM had concluded that, on the basis of thelimited data available, and specifically a 32P-post-labelling study, both compounds should be considered as potential in-vivo mutagens. Further results were now available from the NTP studies on the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of leucomalachite green. These new data included results of lacI mutations in the livers of BigBlue\u00ae rats fed leucomalachite green at levels of up to 543 ppm in thediet for 4, 16 and 32 weeks and results of DNA adducts measurements in the livers of rats fedleucomalachite green for 4 weeks using 32P-postlabelling assays. (Culp SJ et al, Mutation Research vol 506-507, 55-63, 2002). 2.19 The Food Standards Agency had asked the COM for advice on these new data. The mutagenicity data were from studies on leucomalachite green fed to BigBlue\u00ae rats. An approximate 3-fold increase in lacI mutations was reported in the liver only at the top dose level at the 16-week time interval. Anapparent dose-related increase in DNA adducts using the 32P-post-labelling assay was reported. 2.20 Members agreed that the results for lacImutations were unusual in that the claimed positive response seen at 16 weeks feeding had disappeared after 32 weeks of feeding leucomalachite green. It was notedthat the inter-animal variation in mutation frequency was high and the apparent positive result mightrelate to one only out of the five animals fed leucomalachite green for 16 weeks. The Committee was not convinced that a clear positive response had been obtained in this mutagenicity study. A reportedincrease in DNA adducts in the liver of female BigBlue\u00ae rats did correlate with the increasing dose ofleucomalachite green. However, it was noted that adduct levels produced were very low; the highestlevel of DNA adducts found equated to approximately 1 adduct per 10 8nucleotides (this was considered to be a difficult adduct formation frequency to detect). The author's explanation was that the reported increase in mutation frequency at 16 weeks may have been due to a proliferativeresponse of background mutations rather than induced by leucomalachite green. The Committee did not find this particular argument convincing and agreed that overall no conclusions could be reachedfrom the investigations reported in this published paper. 2.21 Members heard that additional information from an NTP bioassay in rats with leucomalachite green would be forthcoming and that it was possible that additional in-vivo mutagenicity studies using BigBlue mice would be reported. 2.22 In answer to the questions posed by the FSA, members agreed that no conclusions could be reached from the new mutagenicity data on leucomalachite green summarised in the paper by Culp SJ et al (Mutation Research vol 506-507, 55-63, 2002). 2.23 The Committee agreed there was no need to alter its previous advice on malachite green and leucomalachite green, but that the situation should be reviewed when full reports of thecarcinogenicity bioassay became available.PT2 is an organophosphorus insecticide. It has been marketed in the UK for use in agriculture and horticulture since 1956. There were three products with approvals for use in agriculture andhorticulture, home garden and use in pigeon lofts at the time when this review was initiated in January2002. A number of products containing malathion are also licensed as human medicines for use in thecontrol of head lice. 2.25 The Advisory Committee on Pesticides reviewed the available toxicological information on malathion as part of its ongoing review of organophosphorus compounds. The ACP asked for advice from COMand COC on mutagenicity and carcinogenicity at its 289 thmeeting on 17 January 2002. The Chairs of COM and COC agreed that a joint statement was required in view of the need for a full review of all mutagenicity and carcinogenicity data. 2.26 The COM undertook an initial consideration of the in-confidence mutagenicity data provided by the pesticide data holder and the available published information provided by the data holder at its 25April 2002 meeting. A number of additional published papers on malathion and impurities present intechnical grade malathion were also considered at this meeting. At its meeting of 10 October 2002 the COM considered some additional information provided in-confidence by the pesticide data holder (areport of one additional in-vivo study and information on the potential for variation in impurities between different sources of malathion) together with a number of published studies notpreviously reviewed. 2.27 The Committee agreed a number of conclusions, which were forwarded to the pesticide data holder. Additional data on the conduct and results of the in-vivo oral rat liver UDS assay were submitted by the pesticide data holder and were considered at the February 2003 meeting of COM. The Committeewas informed that the data holder had responded to the 1st draft statement and there had been an exchange of views between the COM and the data holder particularly with regard to the adequacyof the in-vivo rat liver UDS assay. A revised draft COM statement containing additional comments inresponse to the data holder's submission was agreed. 2.28 Malathion was also considered at the COC meeting of 27 June 2002. A full statement from COC and COM is appended at the end of this report. Phenol2.29 The COM had previously considered phenol on a number of occasions (1994, 1995 & 2000) (http://www.doh.gov.uk/hydphen.htm). The in-vitro data on this compound were poor. The committee had decided that phenol should be regarded as an in-vivo somatic cell mutagen based on positive results at high doses in the bone marrow assays for clastogenicity. Negative results wereobtained in carcinogenicity bioassays in rats and mice. The committee agreed that a threshold formutagenicity could be assumed for the oral route because there was evidence to show that anyphenol active metabolites formed in-vivo were r apidly detoxified by multiple pathways following ingestion. But a threshold for mutagenicity for exposure by other routes, such as inhalation ordermal, could not be assumed. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 1321332.30 Since then, data have become available to provide a plausible mechanism to support the view that positive results in the bone marrow assays were not due to a direct mutagenic effect of phenol, butwere due to a secondary threshold toxic effect, namely hypothermia occurring at dose levels associated with positive results in the micronucleus assays. 2.31 The Committee was asked to consider whether these new unpublished data together with the absence of any other positive in-vivo mutagenicity data and the negative results in the carcinogenicity bioassays indicated that phenol did not produce clastogenic effects at doses below those thatproduced hypothermia. These new data indicate that phenol can produce hypothermia in mice atdoses that result in micronuclei formation. An intraperitoneal dose of 300 mg/kg phenol producedsignificant and prolonged hypothermia with a drop in body temperature of up to 7 degrees centigrade.No effects on body temperature were seen at doses below 300 mg/kg, and single doses of 400 and500 mg/kg reduced body temperature and cause marked lethality. To investigate micronucleusinduction single intraperitoneal doses of phenol were administered at 0, 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg andbone marrow harvested at 24 and 48 hours post dose (cyclophosphamide was used as a positivecontrol and produced micronuclei). An increase in micronuclei was seen only at 300 mg/kg phenol, which was associated with significant and prolonged hypothermia. The investigators argued that theinduction of micronuclei by phenol at the maximum tolerated dose is threshold related and may becausally related to hypothermia. 2.32The COM considered that the new data provided a plausible mechanism. Members agreed the function of spindle fibres could be inhibited at low body temperatures, which could result in adversechromosome effects, such as aneuploidy. The Committee was also aware of other data that indicatedthat hyperthermia can also induce chromosome damage both in-vitro and in-vivo , and that high body temperature induces micronuclei in mouse bone marrow. Members agreed that inhibition of the spindle function and disturbance of the mitotic apparatus was also a possible mechanism for this effect. 2.33 Members agreed that before definite conclusions could be drawn on the significance of these new data they would like to see a peer reviewed published report of this study. Members requested furtherdata on the dose-response of hypothermia induced by phenol. It was also agreed that strong evidenceto support this hypothesis would be provided if micronuclei were not induced by phenol in a separate group of animals maintained at normal body temperature (e.g. by the use of heated plates and warmbeds). If such information could be provided members agreed that phenol could be regarded as havingno significant in-vivo mutagenic potential at dose levels that do not produce any significant toxic effects (hypothermia). 2-Phenylphenol2.34 2-Phenylphenol and its sodium salt are broad spectrum fungicides that are approved in the UK under the Control of Pesticides Regulations (COPR 1986 amended) for use as wood preservatives. They arealso used as surface biocides in a number of areas. The COM have advised on the mutagenicity ofthese compounds, specifically in the context of the mechanism of the bladder tumours seen in malePT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 133Annual Report 2003 134rats fed high doses of these compounds, on a number of occasions, the most recent being in 1997. Significant new relevant data are now available. Furthermore an EU review of the use of 2-phenylphenol and its sodium salt in wood preservation is shortly to be initiated under the BiocidalProducts Directive (98/8/EC). It would thus be timely to update the COM view on the mutagenicityof these compounds. This information would be helpful in developing the UK position with regard tothe EU in the context of the Biocidal Products Directive. 2.35 At high dose levels 2-phenylphenol induces bladder tumours in the rat and it is particularly important to be able to exclude a genotoxic mechanism being involved. In 1992 the COM noted that although negative results were obtained in bone marrow assays and germ cell assays for mutagenicity in-vivo , some conflicting results were obtained in in-vivo assays for effects on the DNA in bladder epithelium.The COM recommended that data from an in-vivo study to investigate DNA adduct formation in bladder epithelium should be carried out using more sensitive methods, to provide definitiveinformation regarding the absence of a genotoxic mechanism. At that time the Committee felt thatthere was insufficient concern to recommend a departure from a risk assessment approach based onthe use of uncertainty factors to estimate safe levels of exposure (i.e. a threshold approach wasadopted). In 1997 the Committee considered data from an in-vivo 32P- post-labelling study on DNA adducts in the bladder but they had concerns at the limitations of the method used andrecommended that this be further investigated. This recommendation was not made into a regulatory request because of other data on carcinogenicity provided to the ACP who felt that the post review regulatory requirements had been provided, and that a threshold based risk assessment was appropriate. 2.36 Considerable additional data has now been published relating to the metabolism and mutagenicity of 2-phenylphenol, including further in-vivo DNA adduct work. The Committee agreed that the new Accelerator Mass Spectrometry study (AMS) study provided good evidence for the lack of covalentDNA binding in the male rat bladder. The method was a particularly sensitive technique and the studyhad been well performed. Protein but not DNA binding had been clearly shown. Members agreed thatthe weight of evidence with regard to the DNA binding studies in the rat bladder was now sufficient toconclude that significant DNA binding was unlikely to occur. 2.37The Committee agreed the following overall conclusions regarding the mutagenicity of 2- phenylphenol and its sodium salt, after consideration of all the new data: i. Data from several assays to investigate the ability of 2-phenylphenol or its sodium salt to produce gene mutation in Salmonella typhimurium were consistently negative. ii. Positive results were obtained in in-vitro metaphase analysis studies in CHO cells and also in mouse lymphoma assays in both cases in the presence of an exogenous metabolic activationsystem. The induction of small colonies in the latter assay is consistent with the compound havingclastogenic potential. phenylphenol, (PHQ usually being present as conjugates), have been shown to produce oxidativeDNA damage and single strand DNA breaks in-vitro using HL60 and V-79 cells. iv. Negative results were obtained in bone marrow assays for clastogenicity in-vivo and also in germ cells (dominant lethal assay), suggesting that any possible clastogenic potential was not expressed in the whole mammal. v. The weight of evidence from in-vivo studies to investigate 2-phenylphenol binding to DNA in the male rat bladder was negative: a recent study using a highly sensitive AMS techniques wasparticularly important in this regard. However the possibility of prolonged high level exposureproducing DNA adducts cannot be entirely discounted. vi. Although a contributory role of oxidative DNA damage cannot be excluded when considering the mechanisms of bladder tumour induction in the male rat, this would not be expected to occur atlow dose levels. vii. The Committee concluded that it would be reasonable to adopt a threshold based risk assessment for 2-phenylphenol and its sodium salt. 2.38 A statement is appended at the end of this report. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in air pollution: A discussion of approaches to risk assessment 2.39The COC has recently evaluated published carcinogenicity data on dibenzo(a,l)pyrene (DB(a,l)P) and had agreed that this compound was between 10-100 times more potent than benzo(a)pyrenedepending on the test system used (see section 3.1 of the COC Annual Report). Thus a paper had beendrafted which considered the potential impact of DB(a,l)P and other high carcinogenic potency PAHson the existing approaches to risk assessment of PAHs in air pollution. 2.40 Three approaches to carcinogenic risk assessment have been advocated: the use of Potency Equivalency Factors (PEFs) (equivalent to Toxicity Equivalent Factors, TEFs, for general toxicity); thecomplete mixture method; and use of B(a)P as a surrogate carcinogen for all PAHs. It was possible that the B(a)P surrogate approach which is currently used to monitor for compliance with UK air pollutionstandard, might not be appropriate if high potency PAHs were present in air pollution and if theconcentrations of these compounds varied significantly when compared to B(a)P. A review of the possible approaches to risk assessment has been undertaken, taking into account available data oncarcinogenicity, including a discussion of kinetics of PAH uptake via the lung and self-induction of PAHmetabolism. COM advice was particularly sought on the proposals for use of DNA adducts ormutations as surrogate end-points for carcinogenic potency.PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 135Annual Report 2003 1362.41 Members agreed that the majority of these compounds were activated in-vivo to diol-epoxides. It was possible to make informed predictions regarding the pathways of metabolism and reaction of diol-epoxides with DNA from the structure of PAHs. Members agreed that PAHs could be considered asmembers of a single group of genotoxic carcinogens whose mechanism of activation, formation ofDNA adducts and metabolism were all broadly similar. There were some exceptions where PAHs werealso metabolised by another minor route also leading to activation and DNA binding, for example thebis-diol-epoxide formed by dibenz(a,h)anthracene (DB(a,h)A). It was agreed that PAHs activated byroutes other than via a diol-epoxide would need to be considered carefully. Members noted the carcinogenic process leading to PAH induced tumourigenicity was complex and included factors suchas tumour promotion and cell proliferation which would also affect carcinogenic potency. PAHs alsohad other molecular targets (e.g. oestrogen receptors) which might potentially impact on thecarcinogenic process in target tissues. 2.42The Committee reviewed the available data regarding use of DNA adducts as a surrogate marker for PAHcarcinogenic potency. There was evidence that DNA adducts may be an adequate endpoint for this group of genotoxic carcinogens from two research groups using different experimental approaches.Dermal application of PAHs to the skin of mice showed a good correlation for DNA adducts in skin andlung with applied skin dose. Studies using intraperitoneal administration of PAHs to A/J mice showed agood correlation between total DNA adducts (Time Integrated DNA Adduct Levels; TIDAL) in lung and administered PAH dose. Both research groups had documented a good correlation between DNAadducts and tumourigenicity. It was suggested that DNA adducts could serve as a pragmatic marker(it is argued for DNA adduct formation from reactive diol-epoxides of PAHs) that correlates withtumourigenicity. It was noted that there was also data from studies in A/J mice using administrationof mixtures of PAHs that suggested that any departure from additivity was limited. 2.43 Members noted the evidence for a lack of correlation between PAH induced mutation frequency in transgenic mice given oral doses of PAHs and target organ for carcinogenicity. Members felt that itwould be important to evaluate dose-response for PAH induced mutation frequency in cancer target tissues in a similar way to the DNA adduct data before conclusions regarding the utility of mutationsas a surrogate marker for PAH induced carcinogenicity could be drawn. 2.44 The Committee considered the proposals for experiments to rank carcinogenic potency of PAHs. It was agreed that intratracheal instillation of small doses in rats, with measurement of total DNAadducts in lung, would be appropriate for inhalation of PAHs. Members also considered thatmeasurement of DNA adducts in skin following topical treatment would also yield a similar rankingof PAHs. It was suggested that it might be possible to undertake DNA adduct measurements anddetermination of PAH induced mutation frequency in the same animals, although it was acknowledgedthis would represent a very large research project and that it was not a practical approach for rankingPAHs. Members briefly considered whether in-vitro approaches could yield relevant data but agreed that differences in metabolism between in-vitro cultures and whole animals would limit the value of in-vitro studies.PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 1361372.45 The Committee agreed the proposals in the draft paper. It was noted that the paper would be provided to COC for comment and then submitted to a peer review journal for publication. Membersasked for detailed information regarding air levels of highly potent carcinogenic PAHs when available. Review of Committee Procedures Horizon Scanning 2.46 The Code of practice published by the Office for Science and Technology (OST) on Guidance for Scientific Advisory Committees (http://www.ost.gov.uk/policy/ advice/ copsac/) encouragedCommittees to develop strategies for the early identification of issues. This included i) \"new issues\" , eg previously unidentified potential chemical mutagens/ carcinogens which may represent a risk to publichealth and where advice is required, and ii) \"new or unexpected developments in science..\" 2.47The COM considered a number of topics for potential future consideration. Members considered that future consideration of the potential for formation of mutagens during food processing/ cooking(particularly frying) would be valuable. On a separate subject it was suggested that the significance ofmitochondrial mutation and the possible genotoxicity of phytoestrogens could be possible topics forfuture COM consideration. 2.48 Regarding new methods of evaluation, members agreed there could be a review of changes in gene expression induced by chemical mutagens. Also further consideration could be given to theappropriate weight of evidence provided by negative in-vivo results in two tissues (as suggested by the COM guidance) when discounting positive results in-vitro . 2.49 It was agreed that members could raise new issues or developments in chemical induced mutagenicity at any time and that the committee should formally discuss issues relating to horizon scanning at least once per year. Test Strategies and Evaluation In-vitro Mammalian cell mutation assays 2.50 The COM guidance on a strategy for testing chemicals for mutagenicity (http://www.doh.gov.uk/ com/guidance.pdf) published in 2000 includes the use of a mammalian cellmutation assay as the third of three in-vitro screening tests recommended in Stage 1 of the testing strategy. The COM concluded that the mouse lymphoma assay using L5178Y cells was the preferredtest. The Committee was asked to review this conclusion in the light of an expert opinion submitted by one pesticide applicant which focused on the use of mammalian cell mutation assays to screen for gene mutagens. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 137Annual Report 2003 1382.51 The Committee agreed that that there was no evidence that the mouse lymphoma assay had any higher inherent sensitivity for the detection of point mutations than other assays in mammalian cellsuch as the hprt assay in CHO cells, provided that adequate number of cells had been used in each assay. This presented, on statistical grounds, some practical difficulty with regard to the use of surfacecultures of CHO cells, rather than with suspension cultures of mouse lymphoma cells. The number ofcells needed is governed by the spontaneous mutation frequency of the cell system used. This is covered in some detail in the OECD test guideline in which it is stated that, as a general guide, the cell number should be at least 10 times the inverse of the spontaneous mutation frequency. The Committeeendorsed this and indicated that, allowing for cytotoxicity, it would usually be necessary to use 10 7 cells or more in the hprt CHO cell assay. 2.52Members also confirmed that another reason why the mouse lymphoma assay was preferred as part of Stage 1 in the COM strategy ( in-vitro screening for potential mutagenicity) was that it detected a wider range of genetic endpoints, for example, chromosome deletions as well as gene mutations. Thisgives the mouse lymphoma assay added value as the second in-vitro mammalian cell assay in addition to cytogenetics in mammalian cells. Members accepted that the hprt CHO cell assay might have a role in mechanistic studies where it was an advantage to specifically measure gene mutation. Strategy for investigating germ cell mutagens2.53The COM guidance on a strategy for testing chemicals for mutagenicity (http://www.doh.gov.uk/ com/guidance.pdf) published in 2000 recommended that in the initial stagesof investigating whether a chemical has in-vivo activity there was no need to screen for germ cellmutagens. This was because all germ cell mutagens had been shown to produce positive results inbone marrow assays, and there was no evidence for any germ cell specific mutagens. It was recognisedthat the reverse was not true, and not all somatic cell mutagens were germ cell mutagens. 2.54 The Committee was made aware of a recent published paper (Witt Kl et al, Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis, volume 41, 111-120, 2003) where evidence had been reported that N-hydroxymethylacrylamide produced positive results in the mouse dominant lethal assay for germ cellmutagenicity, but gave negative results in the micronucleus test in both bone marrow and peripheralerythrocytes. This chemical was negative in a range of in vivo bone marrow assays (using acute, sub- acute and subchronic dosing regimes). Positive results, however, were obtained when an especiallysensitive method involving flow cytometry was used. Positive results were obtained in the dominantlethal assay in mice after one week and 8 weeks dosing. At the latter time point negative results wereobtained in a micronucleus test using peripheral blood. A single dose dominant lethal assay also gavenegative results. 2.55 The Committee was asked whether the data warranted any modification to the COM strategy of testing as outlined in the 2000 guidelines.PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 1381392.56 Members agreed that there were a number of possible reasons why this new study on N- hydroxymethylacrylamide detected a positive mutagenic result in germ cells but not in the bonemarrow. In relation to the analysis for micronuclei in peripheral erythrocytes, it was noted that thespleen could have removed damaged cells. Members felt that accumulation in the germ cells(positive results had only been detected after repeated administration) could also be significant inproducing positive effects on germ cell DNA. Additionally, a certain stage of a developing germ cellcould be more susceptible to N-hydroxymethylacrylamide genetic damage, and germ cells might stay in a susceptible stage for a longer period of time than the faster dividing bone marrow cells. Membersalso felt that some of the bone marrow micronucleus tests involving repeated administration wereequivocal, rather than negative. 2.57The Committee noted that if the COM guidance was followed, a second in vivo assay in a different somatic tissue was needed. After consideration of all the available information, members agreed thatN-hydroxymethylacrylamide was not a germ cell specific mutagen. 2.58 Members considered that this one study by itself did not warrant any change to the COM strategy as outlined in the 2000 guidelines, but that this issue should be kept under review in case other similarexamples were found in the future. Significance of in-vivo mutagenicity at high doses 2.59The COM has previously agreed that it is prudent to assume that there is no threshold for mutagenicity unless appropriate mechanistic data can be provided to identify a threshold relatedmechanism. In-vivo studies in the bone marrow provide key data in identifying compounds as in-vivo mutagens. In some cases the only data available to indicate such in-vivo activity is from mutagenicity studies using excessively high doses (by current guidelines) associated with severe toxicity/lethality,and there is no evidence from carcinogenicity bioassays to suggest that a compound is a genotoxiccarcinogen. Due to the importance of these data in risk assessment, where positive results normallylead to a 'non-threshold' approach being adopted by regulatory agencies, it is important that theobserved effects are not secondary to toxicity. The Committee considered a paper drafted by theSecretariat at its October 2002 meeting which presented \"in-confidence\" data from submissionsreceived by regulatory authorities. These were to be used as examples in order to draft generic guidance which could be published. 2.60 The COM undertook further consideration of this subject at its February and May meetings in 2003. Anumber of potential mechanisms with a threshold of action (eg hypothermia and erythropoiesis) had been identified in the discussion papers as well as severe toxic effects. The COM placed considerableemphasis on considering all the available data on a case-by-case basis, including results fromadequately conducted carcinogenicity bioassays. Due to the close association between mutagenicityand carcinogenicity, two members of the COC attended the February 2003 meeting for the discussionof this item to provide advice on the weight of evidence to be given to carcinogenicity studies. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 139Annual Report 2003 1402.61 Members of COM and COC agreed that consideration needed to be given to the whole data package, including chemical reactivity, toxicokinetics and whether the carcinogenicity data of acompound is consistent with the profile of a genotoxic carcinogen. Chemicals needed to be considered on a case-by-case basis. A negative carcinogenicity bioassay on its own could not discount a 'high dose' positive in-vivo mutagenicity result. Conversely a positive result in a carcinogenicity bioassay may not necessarily mean that a chemical was a mutagen, as there were 'non-genotoxic'mechanisms that could induce cancer. 2.62The committee had previously agreed that in-vivo mutagenicity data from dose levels associated with lethality (ie clearly above the top dose recommended by OECD guidelines) could not beinterpreted with any certainty due to the confounding effects of toxicity. If adequate information werenot available from lower doses then further testing would be required with more appropriate lowerdoses. Members considered that mechanistic data were valuable in discounting positive mutagenicityresults seen at toxic doses i.e. to demonstrate the response was secondary to toxicity. 2.63 It was agreed that adequately conducted carcinogenicity bioassays, if available, provided important information to help evaluate the significance of positive results from mutagenicity studies at 'high'doses. Adequate negative carcinogenicity bioassays, preferably in two species, could be used to helpdiscount evidence of mutagenicity at lethal doses, and where there was some concern at therelevance of the in-vivo mutagenicity data. Members discussed the need to take into account the differences in the maximum dose levels in these studies. It was noted that consideration of thedifferences in maximum dose levels would be of limited value in view of the differences in duration ofdosing (usually 1-2 days compared to 2 years). However consideration should always be given toavailable toxicokinetic data. 2.64 Overall the COM considered that a weight of evidence approach using the whole data package on a case-by-case basis had to be used when considering whether a 'high' dose positive in-vivo result could be discounted in somatic cells due to a biologically plausible mechanism. 2.65 The Committee agreed that the following points need to be considered when deciding whether positive in-vivo bone marrow clastogenicity data can be discounted with regard to considering a compound as an in-vivo mutagen. i. The totality of the relevant data relating to the specific compound in question needs to be considered, including any information on its chemical reactivity, toxicokinetics, its mutagenic profile ( in-vitro and also any available data from carcinogenicity bioassays to enable an assessment to be made as to whether the compound appears to be a genotoxic carcinogen. ii. Positive bone marrow in-vivo mutagenicity data from dose levels that are associated with high levels of toxicity or lethality (ie above the maximum dose level recommended in the currentOECD guidelines) cannot be interpreted with any certainty because of the confounding effects oftoxicity. If adequate information is not available at lower, non-lethal dose levels then retesting is necessary.PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 140141iii. It is also important to consider whether there is any evidence for a plausible mechanism to support the contention that the observed positive results in the bone marrow assays at high doselevels may be secondary to other non-genotoxic effects rather than being a mutagenic effect ofthe compound (or its metabolites). Examples of such mechanisms include (but are not limited to)hypothermia, hyperthermia, and erythropoiesis. iv. Data from adequately conducted carcinogenicity bioassays, if available, provide important information to help in the assessment of the significance of such high dose bone marrowmutagenicity results. Such data may indicate that the carcinogenic profile of the chemical isconsistent with either a genotoxic or a non-genotoxic mechanism, or that the compound is not carcinogenic. v. Only generic advice can be given in this area and it should be emphasised that each compound needs to be considered in a case-by-case basis. However consideration of the above factors, withexpert judgement, may provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the positive in-vivo bone marrow data at high dose levels was due to a non-genotoxic effect. A threshold based riskassessment may thus be appropriate. 2.66 A statement is appended at the end of this report. Ongoing reviews Chromium picolinate 2.67Chromium picolinate is a widely available food supplement. The adverse effects of chromium were recently reviewed by the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM). The reports of genotoxicity associated with chromium picolinate were noted and chromium picolinate was excluded from theirrecommendations for an upper safe level. Following the publication of the EVM report, the Food Standards Agency advised that consumers should use other forms of trivalent chromium supplementsuntil more detailed advice is available. The COM undertook a preliminary discussion of availablemutagenicity data at its October 2003 meeting. A request for additional information has beenforwarded to the manufacturers who supply chromium picolinate to the food supplement industry. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 141Annual Report 2003 of malathion2-PhenylphenolSignificance of in-vivo mutagenicity at high dosesStatements agreed by 18/5/04 12:16 Page 142143Introduction 1. 1,3-dichloropropan-2-ol (1,3-DCP) is a member of a group of chemicals called chloropropanols, which includes 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) and 2,3-dichloropropan-1-ol (2,3-DCP). 1,3-DCP and 3-MCPD can be present as process contaminants in some foodstuffs and as contaminants of polyamineflocculants in drinking water. 1,3-DCP was last considered by the COM and the COC in 2001. COM concluded that it would be prudent to consider 1,3-DCP as potentially genotoxic in vivo but agreed that it should be tested for genotoxicity in vivo using the approach set out in the COM guidelines. 2. 1,3-DCP has been considered by the COC, originally in 1991 and more recently in 2001. The COC noted that in a carcinogenicity study undertaken by Hercules Inc 1. 1,3-DCP was administered in the drinking water of 80 male and 80 female Wistar rats for 104 weeks. Statistically significant positivetrends were observed for benign and malignant tumours (intermediate and high dose level) in the liver,kidney, tongue/ oral cavity and thyroid. The COC concluded that \"it was prudent to assume 1,3-DCPis a genotoxic carcinogen and that exposure to 1,3-DCP should be reduced to as low astechnologically feasible\" 2. COM evaluation: 2001 3. Members agreed that the metabolism of 1,3-DCP was likely to produce a reactive epoxide intermediate that could damage DNA. Members were aware that 1,3-DCP had been found to bemutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535 and or TA 100 3-10. Studies with mammalian cells have produced increased frequencies of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations11,12. Apositive result has been obtained in a mouse lymphoma assay13,14. 1,3-DCP was negative in the wing spot test in Drosophila melanogaster (a somatic mutation and recombination test)15. No in-vivo mammalian studies had been carried out. 4. The Committee concluded that it would be prudent to regard 1,3-DCP as potentially genotoxic in-vivo and agreed that it should be tested for genotoxicity in-vivo using the approach set out in the COM guidelines. COM evaluation: 2003 5. The Committee considered two new in-vivo genotoxicity studies at its May meeting. These comprised a rat bone-marrow micronucleus test and a rat liver unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay, both ofwhich are widely used to assess genotoxicity in vivo .Statement on the mutagenicity of micronucleus test 16 6. The assay followed the current OECD guideline (No. 474). The highest dose used in the study was selected so that it would produce some signs of toxicity, but not severe effects, based on the resultsof a range-finding study. In the main study, 1,3-DCP was administered once daily for two consecutivedays to groups of six male Han Wistar rats at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg. Bone marrow washarvested 24 hours after the final dose. A single sex study was considered adequate because nosubstantial difference in toxicity was observed between males and females in the range-finder. 7. Weight loss (25 mg/kg), piloerection and weight loss (50 mg/kg) and piloerection, weight loss and lethargy (100 mg/kg) were observed in treated animals, indicating that the test was conducted atadequate doses. The Committee noted that the ratios of polychromatic to normochromaticerythrocytes (PCE/NCE) were variable amongst individual animals of the control group. However, themean value was within the range of historical control group mean data. Rats treated with 1,3-DCP atall doses exhibited group mean PCE/NCE ratios that were similar to those of the control group andwithin the normal range. Therefore toxicity to the bone marrow was not demonstrated, although1,3-DCP clearly caused systemic toxicity. 8. There were no statistically significant increases in micronucleus frequency at any dose of 1,3-DCP. The positive control agent, cyclophosphamide, produced a clear increase in micronuclei. Rat liver in-vivo UDS assay 17 9. The UDS assay protocol conformed to the current OECD guideline (No. 486). Based on the results of the range-finder for the micronucleus study, the study was conducted in male rats and the highestdose was 100 mg/kg. Single doses of 40 and 100 mg/kg were administered to groups of four maleHan Wistar rats. Hepatocytes were isolated for analysis for UDS by the autoradiographic techniqueafter 12-14 hours in the first study (3 rats per dose group) and at 2-4 hours in the second study (3 ratsper dose group). 10. In the 2-4 hour experiment, piloerection was observed in all 1,3-DCP treated rats and lethargy was observed at 100 mg/kg. There were no clinical signs following dosing in the 12-14 hour experiment.There was no evidence for any increase in UDS at either dose level or time point. The positive controlcompounds 2-AAF and DMN both gave clear positive results. COM discussion 11. Members agreed that the two new studies met the previously stated requirement that 1,3-DCP should be tested for genotoxicity in-vivo using the approach set out in the COM guidelines. The studies were adequately conducted and gave clear negative results, and therefore Members considered that thesestudies provided evidence that 1,3-DCP was not an in-vivo mutagen. Members then gave consideration as to possible mechanisms whereby mutagenic activity observed in vitro was not expressed in vivo .PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 14414512. The role of metabolism in the in-vitro mutagenicity is unclear. Most bacterial studies have shown mutagenicity both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Two studies indicated thatmetabolism increased the mutagenicity in TA100 and/ or TA1535 7,9, whereas one reported a decrease in TA100 revertants in the presence of metabolic activation8. Activation was found to result in reduced frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in V79 cells11. 13. It has been postulated that metabolism to epichlorhydrin could be responsible for the mutagenicity of 1,3-DCP18. There is some evidence that bacteria can convert 1,3-DCP to epichlorhydrin19, which could account for the direct activity seen in the bacterial mutagenicity tests, although no data are availablewith respect to Salmonella typhimurium . It has been suggested that epichlorhydrin may be formed non-enzymically during the pre-incubation stage of the SOS chromotest assay with Escherichia coli stain GC4798 6. 14. An alternative active metabolite is 1,3-dichloroacetone. It has been postulated that this may be formed from 1,3-DCP by action of alcohol dehydrogenase20or CYP2E121. Glutathione conjugation is believed to be a detoxification pathway since 1,3-DCP depletes glutathione both in vitro 22 and in vivo23, and glutathione depletion has been shown to potentiate the toxicity of 1,3-DCP to rat hepatocytes22. 15. One known route of 1,3-DCP metabolism in rats involves hydroxylation to 3-monochloropropane-1,2- diol (3-MCPD), accounting for 1 to 14% of a 10 mg subcutaneous dose in rats24. The COM has concluded that 3-MCPD can be regarded as having no significant genotoxic potential in vivo25. 16. The COM considered that the metabolism of 1,3-DCP had not been fully elucidated. Metabolic activation in vivo to two active metabolites had been postulated. In both cases the compound formed would be expected to be rapidly de-activated in vivo by glutathione. In one case deactivation would also occur by the action of epoxide hydrolase. Thus once formed, the active metabolite is rapidlydetoxified and hence 1,3-DCP would be unlikely to have significant activity in vivo . This is supported by the negative results obtained in the two new in-vivo mutagenicity assays. Conclusions 17. The Committee concluded that both the rat bone-marrow micronucleus test and the rat liver UDS test had been carried out to an acceptable standard and were negative. Thus the additional informationrecommended by the COM as being necessary to provide adequate reassurance that the mutagenic activity seen in vitro was not expressed in vivo had now been provided. 18. The Committee noted the uncertainties with regard to routes of metabolic activation of 1,3-DCP and agreed that the two new mutagenicity studies supported the view that reactive metabolites, if formed,did not produce genotoxicity in vivo in the tissues assessed. 19. The Committee concluded that 1,3-DCP can be regarded as having no significant genotoxic potential in vivo . COM/03/S4 2003 146References 1. Hercules Inc.

Mutagenicity 18/5/04 12:16 148Background to COM review 1. Flunixin in the form of the meglumine salt is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug and a non-narcotic analgesic drug with antipyretic activities. It is used in veterinary medicine (includingfood-producing animals) but it is not used in human medicine. Flunixin-meglumine dissociates in-vivo to Flunixin and meglumine. In 1997, the European Medicine Evaluation Agency's (EMEA) Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) considered the safety of Flunixin-meglumine as part of its review of old veterinary medicinal products, operating under Council Regulation 2377 /90, which covers the marketing authorisation of pharmacologically active substances used in veterinary medicines. 2. With regard to meglumine, the CVMP considered that it could be regarded as an excipient that had the purpose of increasing the solubility of flunixin. The CVMP concluded that \"meglumine used as anexcipient at up to 1.5 mg/kg bw does not fall within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC)number 2377 /90\" 1. 3. The Food Standards Agency is concerned about the possible mutagenicity of Flunixin-meglumine, meglumine and Flunixin. The Food Standards Agency considered that it would be useful to seek theopinion of the COM. Assessment of Mutagenicity data 4. As a general comment Members noted that relatively high levels of micronuclei had been documented in all of the in-vivo bone-marrow micronuclei studies submitted on these chemicals which had all been undertaken in the early 1980s by one particular contract laboratory. Flunixin5. The available mutagenicity data were relatively old and of limited value. Negative results were reported in Salmonella typhimurium 2and in an in-vivo micronucleus assay in BS1 mice using intraperitoneal administration of two doses separated by 24 hours (200 mg/kg bw reduced to150 mg/kg bw) and harvested 6 hours after the last dose 3. The DNA damage assay in Escherichia coli p3478 repair deficient strain showed an increase in DNA damage at one interim concentration, but thisfinding was not seen in a repeat test 4. A positive result was claimed in a mitotic gene conversion assay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae5. 6. Overall Members agreed that there was limited evidence that Flunixin was mutagenic in-vitro but there was no evidence to suggest that Flunixin had mutagenic potential in-vivo . Members felt the in- vitro mutagenicity data on this compound were inadequate and considered this should be raised with the CVMP. Statement on flunixin, meglumine and flunixin megluminePT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 148149Meglumine 7. Negative results were reported in an old plate incorporation assay in a limited number of Salmonella typhimurium strains6. A positive result had been reported in a bone-marrow micronucleus assay in BSI mice using intraperitoneal administration of 500 or 1000 mg/kg bw suspended in 0.25%methylcellulose (two doses given 24 hours apart and harvest 6 hours after last dose) 7. A repeat test using 1000 mg/kg bw was also positive. Members queried how the repeat test could have beenundertaken on the same day as the initial test. It was noted that negative results were obtained in aseparate in-vivo micronucleus assay using intraperitoneal administration of two doses given 24 hours apart at up to 600 mg/kg bw of meglumine to CD1 mice 8. Members noted that a clear positive control response had only been seen in males and not females in this latter assay and that the sampling regimen (24 and 48 hours after last dose) differed from the study in BS1 mice. 8. A number of in-vivo bone marrow micronucleus assays were recently undertaken for the Committee using a variety of single/ double intraperitoneal dosing regimens at dose levels of 500 bw and 1000 mg/kg bw and sampling for micronuclei at 6 or 24 h after the last dose9. There was some evidence for an effect 6 h after the second dose in one study using Alpk:ApfCD-1 mice, but no definite conclusions could be reached as the result was not repeatable, there was considerableindividual animal variation and the observed effect could have been complicated by toxicity. 9. The Committee agreed that there was a need to further evaluate the potential mutagenicity of meglumine. This is discussed in the COM evaluation section below. Flunixin meglumine 10. Members agreed that the mutagenicity data on Flunixin-meglumine (ie the mixture used in veterinary medicines) was difficult to assess. Negative results were reported in an old plate incorporation assayusing a limited number of Salmonella typhimurium strains 10. Negative results were also reported in an in-vitro UDS assay using rat hepatocytes11. Positive results were documented in a mitotic gene conversion assay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae12,13. There was also evidence for DNA damage in two separate tests in Escherichia coli p3478 repair deficient strain but not in a third test14,15,16. However there was limited evidence for a mutagenic effect in three separate mouse lymphoma assays17,18,19and evidence for an equivocal response in a cytogenetics test in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells20. 11. Overall the Committee agreed that there was limited evidence that Flunixin-meglumine was an in-vitro mutagen. Members noted that negative results had been documented in an in-vivo micronucleus assay in BS1mice using intraperitoneal administration of two doses (up to 80 mg/kg bw) separated by 24 hand sampling 6 h after the last dose. Members were concerned with regard to the adequacy of theselection of dose levels 21In addition the inconclusive in-vivo data on meglumine suggest that a definite conclusion regarding Flunixin-meglumine cannot be reached. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 149Annual Report 2003 150COM Evaluation 12. The Committee noted the poor quality of mutagenicity data on Flunixin, meglumine and Flunixin- meglumine. Members noted that while negative results obtained in carcinogenicity bioassays withFlunixin-meglumine in the rat and the mouse provided some reassurance with regard to Flunixin,they were not informative with regard to meglumine. 13. The Committee was aware of several in-vivo bone-marrow micronucleus assays using meglumine but noted that the results were inconsistent. Thus there was evidence in two separate studies (in BS1and Alpk:ApfCD-1 mice) for a mutagenic effect following intraperitoneal dosing of 1000 mg/kg bwfollowing a treatment regime of two doses of meglumine (24 hour apart) with a sampling time of 6hours after the second dose (ie 30 hours after the first dose) 7,9. One of these studies had been undertaken by a Committee member. However this result was not repeated in two recent bonemarrow micronucleus assays in mice which had been conducted for the Committee whichattempted to repeat these findings using an equivalent treatment regime 9. 14. The Committee considered a number of options for further investigating the mutagenicity of meglumine. The Committee agreed the most appropriate way forward would be to request additionalin-vitro assays with meglumine to properly assess whether meglumine had mutagenic potential in-vitro before considering the need for any further in-vivo mutagenicity studies with meglumine. Thus data were required from an in-vitro chromosomal aberration assay and a mouse lymphoma assay, which together with the data currently available for a test in bacteria using Salmonella, would complete the in-vitro package to modern standards given in the COM guidance. In this case the weak andinconsistent induction of micronuclei in mice after two treatments with meglumine 24 hours apartwith sampling 6 hours after the last treatment would be disregarded as strain-or-system specificeffects of no genotoxic relevance if these two additional in-vitro tests were negative. 15. Thus negative data were available for a test in bacteria using Salmonella, but data were required from an in-vitro chromosomal aberration assay in mammalian cells and a mouse lymphoma assay to complete the in-vitro package to modern standards given in the COM Guidance 22.If these were negative, there would be no concerns regarding meglumine. Consideration of presentation by Schering-Plough on mutagenicity testing strategy (6 February 2003) 16. Schering-Plough (referred to as the data holder in this statement) suggested that two further in-vivo mutagenicity studies be carried out with meglumine, namely a bone-marrow chromosome aberrationassay in rats and a bone-marrow micronucleus test in rats. 17. Members considered the presentation and concluded that provision of two adequately conducted in-vitro tests as outlined in COM Guidance with negative results would obviate the need for anyfurther in-vivo testing. The purpose of these assays would be initial screening of meglumine and its metabolites in-vitro . The data holder proposal. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 15015118. COC Members considered some additional data23provided by the data holder on the conduct of the carcinogenicity studies in the rat and mouse using Flunixin-meglumine and drew conclusions withregard to the adequacy of these studies for the assessment of Flunixin-meglumine and meglumine (see paragraph 12 above). The COM noted comments from the data holder on the rapid dissociation ofFlunixin-meglumine into Flunixin and meglumine and the suggested fast metabolism of meglumine. TheCOM agreed that it would be useful for the data holder to consider undertaking appropriate ADME studies with meglumine using radiolabelled material. COM conclusion and recommendations 19. The COM concluded: i. The mutagenicity data on Flunixin, Flunixin-meglumine and meglumine are relatively old and the studies have not been conducted to contemporary standards. ii. It is therefore difficult to draw any definite conclusions on the mutagenicity of these chemicals. Anumber of prudent conclusions were agreed: a. For Flunixin (a non-steroidal anti inflammatory veterinary medicine) there was limited evidence that Flunixin was mutagenic in-vitro but there was no evidence to suggest that flunixin had mutagenic potential in-vivo . Members felt the in-vitro mutagenicity data on this compound wereinadequate and considered this should be raised with the CVMP. b. For Flunixin-meglumine, (Flunixin in the form of the meglumine salt) there is limited evidence for a mutagenic effect in-vitro . In addition the inconclusive in-vivo data on meglumine suggest that a definite conclusion regarding flunixin-meglumine cannot be reached. c. For meglumine, the available in-vivo mutagenicity data are inconsistent with some positive and negative results. It is recommended that additional in-vitro mutagenicity tests conducted to modern standards are undertaken with meglumine to assess whether meglumine has anymutagenic potential using the approach recommended in the COM Guidance. Negative resultsare available for a gene mutation assay in Salmonella . Therefore these additional tests should comprise: i. An in-vitro chromosomal aberration test in mammalian cells. ii. An in-vitro lymphoma assay.

Malathion is an organophosphorous insecticide. It has been marketed in the UK for use in agriculture and horticulture since 1956. There were three products with approvals for use in agriculture andhorticulture, home garden and use in pigeon lofts at the time when this review was initiated in January2002. A number of products containing malathion are also licensed as human medicines for use inthe control of head lice. 2. The Advisory Committee on Pesticides is reviewing the available toxicological information on malathion as part of its ongoing review of organophosphorous compounds. The ACP asked for advicefrom COM and COC on mutagenicity and carcinogenicity at its 289th meeting on 17 January 2002.There are inconsistent results in mutagenicity studies (both in-vitro and in-vivo ) and there is evidence for the mutagenic activity of some impurities which may be present in some batches of technical malathion. There is also some limited evidence for tumourigenicity in rats (in particular the occurrenceof benign nasal tumours in animals given high oral doses of technical grade malathion in the diet). 3. The Chairs of COM and COC agreed that a joint statement was required in view of the need for a full review of all mutagenicity and carcinogenicity data. 4. The COM undertook an initial consideration of the in confidence mutagenicity data provided by the pesticide data holder 1-5and available published information provided by the data holder6-55at its 25 April 2002 meeting. A number of additional published papers on malathion56-61and impurities present in technical grade malathion were also considered at this meeting62-65. The COC reviewed the available carcinogenicity data on malathion which included in confidence reports (provided by the pesticide dataholder regarding two studies in rats one in mice) 66-68and published reports of long-term bioassays in rats69,70and mice69at its 27 June 2002 meeting. Three long-term bioassays using malaoxon (the principle metabolite of malathion and also present in technical grade malathion as an impurity) were availablewhich included two in rats 71,72and one in mice71. In addition the Committee also considered in confidence reports of Peer Reviews of the histology slides from the 1993-96 rats77provided by the Pesticide Data holder. A number of additional follow up reports from the contract laboratoryconcerning the 1993-96 bioassay of malathion in F344 rats were also reviewed 78-81. In addition the pesticide data holder submitted a response to questions from COC secretariat which provided anoverall summary of the histology of the nasal tissue in animals with tumours and additional evaluation of the historical control data on nasal tumours in F344 rats and possible mechanisms for nasal tumoursinduced in F344 rats fed high doses of technical grade malathion 82. A published Peer Review of a number of published carcinogenicity bioassays was also available83. The COC also considered expert reports from the EPA84and a Scientific Advisory Panel85established by EPA to review malathion. At its meeting of 10 October 2002 the COM considered some additional information provided in confidenceby the pesticide data holder (a report of one additional in-vivo study 86and information on the potential for variation in impurities between different sources of malathion87) together with number of published studies not previously reviewed88-92. The in confidence reports provided by the pesticides data holder contained appropriate Good Laboratory Practice and Quality Assurance statements. Joint statement on review of malathionPT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 154155Introduction to review 5. The Committees had access to sections of the draft risk assessment prepared by the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) for the ACP. This include evaluations of the absorption, distribution, metabolism andexcretion and toxicology data on malathion. Information on the manufacturing process used by thepesticide data holder and the impurities present in commercial technical material was presented. 6. The Committees noted that malathion is an organophosphorothiolate compound and required activation to malaoxon which inhibits cholinesterases in mammals. It is rapidly absorbed orally and israpidly metabolised and excreted (mainly in the urine) as metabolites. Dermal absorption studies in human volunteers suggested a moderate absorption (6-15%) depending on formulation and malathionconcentration. The available information from a wide range of toxicity studies (including acute, sub acute, sub chronic and chronic studies and reproduction studies in a range of species) demonstratedthat inhibition of cholinesterase is the most sensitive toxicological effect in all available studies. Thetoxicity of malathion can be influenced by the presence of impurities in the technical material. Thus, for example, data presented in the PSD draft risk assessment showed that isomalathion andOOS-trimethyl phosphorothioate can inhibit the detoxification (via carboxyesterases and glutathione)of malaoxon resulting in a potentiation of cholinesterase effects of this compound. It was notable thatthe acute toxicity of technical grade malathion differed between two manufacturing sources. In answerto questions raised by the COM, the pesticide data holder reported that the levels of impurities would vary according to quality of raw materials, reaction parameters and purification steps. In addition it was also reported that the level of one impurity (isomalathion) could increase during storage of technicalgrade malathion. Thus the possibility that impurities may have mutagenic potential needed to beconsidered. The Committee agreed that the specification of the test materials used in mutagenicity studies undertaken by the pesticide data holder had been adequately demonstrated. The evidenceprovided by the Pesticide Data Holder suggested that the impurities present in technical grademalathion from other manufacturers would be qualitatively similar but it was not possible to drawany conclusions on the levels of the individual impurities in the test materials used in publishedmutagenicity studies. COM review of mutagenicity In-vitro data on malathion 7. It was agreed that the primary objective of the COM review was to consider the mutagenic potential of commercially supplied (e.g. technical grade) malathion. Technical grade malathion used in many ofthe reported mutagenicity tests had a purity of between 93-96%, whilst in a small number ofpublished studiesthe authors reported using highly purified malathion ( /H3289799%) 8,38,39,51. The COM methylating agent56. N7-Methyl guanine was the main identified adduct but others could not be excluded. There were also data to show that iso-malathion (an impurity formedduring manufacture and storage) and OOO-trimethylphosphorothioate (a process impurity found insome batches of technical grade malathion) could alkylate nitro-benzyl-pyridine in-vitro 62. The Committees noted the proposed metabolism pathway in the draft risk assessment document prepared by the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) and agreed that there were a number ofmalathion metabolites identified in metabolism studies, which could theoretically methylate DNA. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 155Annual Report 2003 1568. The Committee agreed that there was no evidence for mutagenicity of technical grade malathion in bacteria. The results in a number of tests in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli were negative1,14,21,24,30,31. The significance of enhanced SOS DNA repair activity in Escherichia coli was unclear50. The COM noted that only brief details of the studies in yeast were available, 21,31but considered that further evaluation of the data would be of limited value in view of the clear evidence for in vitro mutagenicity in mammalian cells (see next para). 9. Regarding in-vitro assays in mammalian cells, the COM agreed that a cytogenetics assay with technical grade malathion conducted by the pesticide approval holder, was positive in the presence and absenceof endogenous metabolic activation at the high dose (which was moderately cytotoxic) 4. The Committee reviewed the available published literature and agreed that details of purity of malathion used was absent in several studies. However, the COM agreed that positive results had been obtainedin published studies in human lymphocytes, where malathion was of technical grade or of higherpurity ( /H3289799%) 23,27,51. Activity was reported both in the presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation. Additionally, technical grade23,27and purified malathion ( /H3289799% pure)38,39had been shown to induce Sister Chromatid Exchanges in mammalian cells (CHO cells) and human lymphocytes and fibroblasts. The COM also noted that evidence for a gene mutation in the hprt locus in human lymphocytes had been published41. The authors of this study noted that positive results had also been reported for different batches of technical grade malathion, which had contained slightly different levels of impurities. In a subsequent publication, these authors had provided limited information tosuggest that malathion might induce specific mutations in the hprt gene in human lymphocytes. Therewas evidence for an increase in mutations at G:C base pairs and at GG dinucleotides in hprt gene in malathion treated cells compared to unexposed cells 89. The Committee agreed that the mouse lymphoma assay, recently conducted by the pesticide data holder using technical grade material, hadalso given positive results in the presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation after a short4-hour exposure period 3. However, a second trial using a 24-hour exposure period was negative (COM Members commented that the control mutation frequency in this study was relatively highand this might mask a weak positive response). 10. The COM agreed that the UDS assay in isolated hepatocytes with technical grade material, which had been submitted by the pesticide data holder, was negative 2. The Committee noted that although the top dose level (0.16 /H9262l/ml) had produced evidence of cytotoxicity, the dose might have been too low to detect any DNA damage induced by impurities rather than by malathion itself. The Committee noted that a recent COMET assay with malathion (98% pure) and using human peripheral bloodlymphocytes had yielded negative results 12. However, no exogenous metabolic activation had been used and the exposure period (1hour) used in this study was shorter than expected for an adequateregulatory study (ca 3 or 24-h). 11. Overall the COM agreed that the available evidence was consistent with the conclusion that technical grade malathion (including its metabolites and impurities) induced the mutagenicity observed in in-vitro studies. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 156157In-vitro data on malaoxon 12. The Committee reviewed the available in-vitro mutagenicity data on malaoxon, the principle metabolite of mutagenic theabsence of exogenous metabolic activation, and induced SCEs in CHO cells 64,65. The test material used in these assays was approximately 94-96% pure. Malaoxon (98% pure) had also induced DNA damagein human peripheral blood lymphocytes in one assay 63. 13. The committee considered that the mutagenic activity seen in-vitro with technical grade malathion could, in part, be due to the metabolism of malathion to malaoxon. In-vivo data on malathion Studies submitted by the pesticide data holder 14. The Committee agreed that the oral rat bone marrow clastogenicity study, conducted by the pesticide data holder using high doses of technical grade material, had been adequately conductedand was negative 5. 15. The Committee had reservations regarding the adequacy of the oral in-vivo liver UDS assay in rats submitted by the pesticide data holder86. Members were concerned with regard to the apparent positive response in animals 24 and 25 in the assay. The Committee did not accept the rationaleprovided by the contract laboratory that these positive responses were caused by technical errors(staining errors, the timing of dosing relative to other rats and/ or use of control rats sampled 2-4 hoursafter dosing as controls for treated rats sampled 12-16 hours after dosing). Members also considered itfeasible that a positive control substance had been dosed to these animals by mistake or there had been a mislabelling of the animals. Whilst such explanations may be plausible, there was a lack ofdirect evidence linking the positive effects in the two rats to any experimental error. However, it wasnoted that no evidence of mutagenicity was found in a repeated 12-16 hour sampling time experiment.Overall the COM agreed that no weight could be attributed to the study and that it should berepeated. Negative results in such a repeat study would remove any concerns that technical grade malathion was mutagenic to rats when dosed orally. Published Studies 16. The Committee was aware that there were a large number of published in-vivo studies which reported positive results for malathion. No definite conclusions could be drawn from the majority of these studies because the test material used was not of technical grade or the purity could notbe determined and/ or the methods used were inadequate by current standards 6,8,18-20,28,33,42,57,90. The Committee was aware that there were some studies which reported negative findings in-vivo with technical grade malathion17,46,52,53but agreed that it was important to consider in detail the available studies where positive finding had been reported and where there was sufficient information reportedto comment on the results 18,57,90. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 157Annual Report 2003 158Oral administration 17. Giri et al (2002)57documented limited evidence for an increase in chromosomal aberrations in bone- marrow of groups of 3 Swiss mice (sex not given) given either a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg bw or fivedaily doses of 2 mg/kg bw. A fixation time of 24 hours after the last dose was used. The test materialused was a technical grade material manufactured in India 93.The Committee agreed that in view of the lack of lack of evidence for carcinogenicity in the long-term feeding carcinogenicity bioassay in mice,that there was no need for a further oral study in mice at this juncture. Dermal administration 18. The Committee considered the study by Dulout et al. (1982) 90which had used both the dermal and intraperitoneal routes of dosing in bone-marrow micronucleus assays in mice. Members agreed it wasdifficult to explain why such a strong positive response had been documented following dermalapplication compared to intraperitoneal dosing. The test material (a technical grade materialmanufactured in Argentina) had been dissolved in corn oil which would have led to residual vehicleon the skin. Members noted that dermal absorption in human volunteers ranged from 5% to 15%depending on formulation and dilution with water. It was not possible to quantify the extent of dermalabsorption in this study. There would have also been some oral ingestion arising by grooming of theanimals, but his could not be quantified. Members noted that there was no evidence for a doseresponse following dermal administration in this study, but felt that the results could not be refuted and thus there was a need for a repeat study in mice. Intraperitoneal administration 19. The Committee agreed there was evidence from several studies for a mutagenic effect of technical grade malathion in the bone-marrow of mice given the test material by intraperitoneal administration 18,57,90. The Committee agreed that these data suggested technical grade malathion had mutagenic activity in-vivo in mice and reinforced the need to evaluate dermal exposure to technical grade malathion adequately. 20. Overall the Committee concluded that malathion was mutagenic in-vivo in mice dosed by the intraperitoneal route, and possibly also by the oral and dermal routes. Conversely, there was noevidence of in-vivo mutagenicity in rats dosed orally. These data may indicate species-specific in-vivo mutagenicity in mice. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 158159Studies in humans exposed to malathion and other pesticides 21. The Committee discussed the available studies in humans exposed to malathion14,29,35,44,47,49,54. It was noted that an increase in the incidence of micronuclei had been reported by the Californian HealthDepartment, in a preliminary study of 13 applicators who used malathion in 1992 14,54. This result was not confirmed by a further study undertaken by the same group of researchers in 199314,54. Overall the Committee felt that no conclusions could be drawn from this study. The Committee considered that no conclusions could be derived from the other available published studies relating to monitoring ofhuman exposure for mutagenic effects. The Committee concluded that appropriately designed studiesof pesticide applicators using malathion, might be informative with regard to mutagenic activity inhumans. Response of data holder to COM Evaluation (19/11/02 and 2/01/03) 22. The data holder provided some additional data on the 19 November 2002 on the in-vivo liver UDS assay in rats 86, namely additional details of the conduct of the study and results in animals 24 and 25 and photomicrographs of slides from animal 24 and from a negative and positive control animal. It wasnoted that additional repeat investigations had been included in the study which had been triggeredwhen technical difficulties concerning animals 24 and 25 had been noted. The data holder provided anadditional in-vivo intraperitoneal micronucleus assay in the mouse 94. The holder provided comments on the dermal in-vivo micronucleus assay in mice published by Dulout et al90. Additional photomicrographs and comments on the conduct of the rat liver UDS assay were provided by thepesticide data holder on 2 January 2003. COM comments 23. Regarding the new data on the rat liver UDS assay, COM members considered the additional data submitted on the 19/11/02 and on 2/01/03 and agreed that the assay was flawed. The argumentsregarding the background staining of the slides did not match with the reported positive NNG values for animals 24 and 25. Overall members could not endorse this assay. The lack of evidence for a carcinogenic effect in livers of rats dosed with malathion is noted. However considering the clearmutagenicity of malathion in-vitro and in some other in-vivo assays, an adequate, technically defensible assay is considered appropriate. 24. Members noted the new intraperitoneal bone marrow micronucleus test which gave negative results and provided some reassurance, although the specification of the test material was uncertain and only1000 PCEs had been scored 94. 25. COM members acknowledged there are considerable problems with the conduct of study reported by Dulout et al. 198290. However members felt that the pesticide data holder had not provided a rationale to suggest it was a false positive response and agreed that a repeat dermal assay was appropriate. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 159Annual Report 2003 16026. The COM considered other comments from the Data holder regarding the interpretation of human studies and the assessment of in-vitro studies with malathion. The Committee agreed that no alterations with regard to these areas of the statement were required. COM conclusions 27. The Committee agreed the following conclusions: i. Technical grade malathion is mutagenic in-vitro in human lymphocytes and mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma cells). The observed mutagenic activity is due to malathion, its metabolites andits impurities. ii. The weight of evidence suggests technical grade malathion is not mutagenic following oral administration to rats. There is a need for a further in-vivo oral rat liver UDS assay with technical grade material supplied in the UK. Negative results in such an assay would provide full reassurance with regard to oral exposure of rats to technical grade malathion. There is good evidence for a mutagenic effect of technical grade malathion given intraperitoneally to mice, and some limited evidence for mutagenicity in mice with oral or dermal administration. TheCommittee recommends that a further study using dermal administration in mice would be appropriate to adequately assess the potential for mutagenicity by this route of exposure as thisis particularly relevant to the route of human exposure. iii. There are a number of studies of humans exposed to malathion which have investigated potential mutagenic effects. There are limitations in all of these studies predominantly due tosmall numbers of subjects, study design and co-exposure to other chemicals which might havemutagenic effects. No conclusions could be drawn from the available data. Further monitoring ofpopulations exposed to malathion might be informative with regard to potential mutagenicactivity in humans. COC review of carcinogenicity 28. The Committee reviewed the conduct, adequacy and results from the available carcinogenicity bioassays in rats and mice where malathion or malaoxon had been administered in the diet. 66-72 In reviewing these studies, the COC agreed that particular reference should be made to theevaluation of nasal tissue. The Committee commented that nasal tissue was generally not examined in carcinogenicity bioassays until around 1990. The Committee made the following comments oneach of the long-term bioassays. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 NCI 1978, Osborne Mendel rat69. The study authors had reported that there was an increase in thyroid follicular cell carcinomas/ adenomas in females in the high dose group. A peer review of pathology had concluded that there was no significant increase in thyroid tumours83. The COC noted there was no examination of nasal tissue, non-neoplastic pathology was reported in females but not males, therewere no full necropsies of decedents and the control groups were too small. Overall it was agreed that this study was inadequate by contemporary standards and no conclusions could be drawn. 30. FDRL 1980, Sprague Dawley Rat 66. The study authors had not reported any evidence for a treatment related carcinogenic effect. The committee noted that there was no examination of nasal tissue. With this limitation noted, the committee considered the study had in general been adequately undertaken. 31. NCI 1979, Rat F34471. There was an increase incidence in phaeochromocytomas in low dose but this was not found in high dose males, and the absence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia further questioned the significance of this finding. There was limited evidence for increased leukaemia in lowdose males. It was agreed that this study provided no consistent evidence for a carcinogenic effect.The COC noted that examination of nasal tissue had not been undertaken in this study, but agreedthat overall the study had in general been conducted adequately. 32. HLS 1993-1996, Rat F344 72. The COC agreed that this bioassay was conducted to modern standards and was the critical carcinogenicity study in the rat. Dietary levels used were 100 ppm (reduced to 50 ppm at month 3), 500 ppm, 6000 ppm and 12000 ppm. (Averaged dose levels (mg/kg 739/868 mg/kg bw/ day). The COC considered that the top two dose levels in males exceeded the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) level. This was based on reduced mean body weight (-16.8% at month 18 in the 12000 ppm group and -11.1% at 6000 ppm) and statistically increased mortality compared to control animals. In females the MTD was exceeded at12000 ppm (based on reduced mean body weight at 24 months; -16.8% and significant mortalitycompared to controls) but was not exceeded at 6000 ppm (mean reduction in body weight /H11021 5.1% compared to controls, 62% survival to termination). The study investigators had documented two nasal tumours in males (an olfactory epithelial adenoma in one animal at 6000 ppm and an olfactoryepithelial carcinoma in one animal at 12000 ppm). The COC noted that an independent peer review ofthe nasal pathology had been undertaken 73. The COC concluded that the report of the peer review was satisfactory and agreed that the classsification of tumours used in this review should be used in the evaluation of this cancer bioassay. Following the peer review of the pathology, a consensusagreement had been reached that there were three nasal respiratory adenomas (one male and onefemale) at 12000 ppm and one female at 6000 ppm) and an olfactory epithelial adenoma in one male at 6000 ppm. These tumours were associated with severe non-neoplastic pathology in the nasal tissue at 6000 and 12000 ppm (including epithelial degeneration, hyperplasia and inflammation). The peer review also documented four tumours of the oral palate. The data holder had provided a concise summary of the neoplastic pathology in animals with nasal tumours 82. The COC observed that based on the relatively small laboratory historical control data, the incidence of nasal tumours was highlystatistically significant. However it was evident from the EPA review and information supplied by thedata holder that the background incidence of nasal tumours was unclear and depended upon thenumber of nasal sections used in bioassays 82,84. In modern bioassays this would comprise 5 sectionsPT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 161Annual Report 2003 162whilst only two sections were used in the bioassays in the laboratory historical control database. The historical control range from 20 bioassays undertaken as part of the NTP program was 0-2% in bothmales and females. The Committee considered that overall there was evidence of a tumourigenicresponse to malathion in the nasal tissue of the rat but the observed tumours were induced in tissue which was subject to severe ongoing nasal inflammation. The COC agreed there was an increase inliver tumours at the two highest dose levels and that this was likely to be due to an effect oftreatment on the background pathology of ageing animals. Malathion bioassays in mice 33. NCI 1978, Mouse B6C3F1 69. The COC observed that there was no examination of nasal tissue, there were no full necropsies of decedents and the control groups were too small. A statistically significant increase in combined hepatocellular carcinoma and neoplastic nodule were reported in males animalsby trend analysis. No increase was reported when analysed by pair wise comparison or by life-time analysis. The Committee commented that the terminology used to describe histological lesions of theliver was now considered outdated and that there was a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma inhistorical control groups. The committee agreed that by contemporary standards this bioassay wasinadequate. The Committee observed the evidence of coughing and wheezing in most high doseanimals from week 72 which provided some evidence for an effect on the respiratory tract. 34. HLS 1992-1994, Mouse B6C3F1 68. The COC agreed that this bioassay had been conducted to modern standards. Dietary levels of 100 ppm, 800 ppm, 8,000 ppm, and 16000 ppm were used. (Averaged doselevels 1476/1707,2978/3448 mg/kg bw/ day) The COC agreed that the Maximum Tolerated Dose level was exceeded at16 000 ppm in both males (-20 % reduction in mean body weight compared to controls at week 78)and in females (-16% reduction in mean body weight compared to controls at week 78). The MTD wasexceeded in males at 8000 ppm (-14% reduction in mean body weight compared to controls at week78). The COC considered that the 8000 ppm dose level in females equated to the MTD (reduction in mean body weight for females was -9.7%). The study investigators reported the finding ofhepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular hypertrophy and increase liver weight in (male andfemale) at 8000 ppm and 16000 ppm. A Peer review of histology in male mice essentially confirmed the liver findings reported by the study investigators 75. The Peer review group also identified significant and excessive non neoplastic pathology of the nasal tissue similar to that reported in F344 rats. TheCommittee agreed that the liver tumours were treatment related. Malaoxon bioassays in rats 35. NCI 1979, Rat F344 71. A statistically significant increase in thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas werereported in females at the top dose. A Peer review had been undertaken83. The Committee agreed with the conclusion reached by the peer review group that the evidence for a carcinogeniceffect in the thyroid was equivocal. The Committee noted that examination of nasal tissue had notbeen undertaken in this study. The Committee noted the high dietary level was 1000 ppm, but agreedthat, based on the preliminary 13 week study (no effects on body weight or histology at 2000 ppm),ahigher dose level might have been used. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 16216336. HLS 1993-1996, Rat F34472.The COC agreed that this bioassay had been conducted to modern standards. Dietary levels of 20 ppm, 1000 ppm, and 2,000 ppm were used. (Averaged dose levels(mg/kg bw/ day) in males females /68, 114/141 mg/kg bw/ day) TheCommittee considered that the Maximum Tolerated Dose level had not been exceeded in this study (-1.4% to -7.1% reduction in body weight compared to controls in males and -4.0% to -8.8% in femalesat termination). However a dose related increase in mortality was reported in males. A significant dose-related trend in mononuclear cell leukaemia was reported in males but no statistically significantincrease was evident in pair wise comparisons with controls. The incidence of this tumour was withinthe historical control for the laboratory. A significant increase in testicular interstitial cell tumours wasreported at 2000 ppm when the data were corrected for time to tumour identification. However the observed increase was within the historical control incidence. There was thus no evidence for anytreatment related increase in neoplasia. The study investigators found significant non-neoplasticpathology of the nasal tissue and respiratory tract. This included significant purulent inflammationof the lungs. There was evidence of food particle deposition in many animals in this study. Malaoxon bioassay in mice 37. NCI 1979, Mouse B6C3F1 71. The COC noted that examination of nasal tissue had not been undertaken in this study. The Committee noted the high dietary level was 1000 ppm, but agreed that, based on thepreliminary 13 week study (no effects on body weight at 2000 ppm), a higher dose level might havebeen used. No treatment related neoplasia were reported. Overall malathion carcinogenicity evaluation 38. The COC agreed that the assessment of the significance of the observed nasal tumours in F344 rats in the modern study undertaken by HLS USA was the critical neoplasm for discussion. The Committeeagreed that the finding of liver tumours in F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice in the modern studies should alsobe evaluated in detail. The findings reported in earlier studies undertaken in the 1970's and 80'scontributed little weight of evidence to the assessment of malathion. Nasal tumours in F344 rats 39. The COC noted that tumours of the nasal tissue in F344 rats were rare and that there were difficulties in assessment particularly with regard to the adequacy of historical control data from the laboratory.The COC noted the additional sectioning and microscopic evaluation of additional slides from the HLSUSA study suggested that the US NTP historical control data for F344 rats might be more appropriate.Overall it was agreed that a tumourigenic response had been documented in this study. The COCobserved that the observed tumours were all benign and included an olfactory epithelial adenomaarising from the Bowmans' gland in a male fed 6000 ppm and a respiratory epithelial adenoma in amale fed 12000 ppm. In females one animal at 6000 ppm and one at 12000 ppm had respiratoryepithelial adenomas. All tumours were well defined and there was no evidence of pleomorphism oratypia 82. The Committee considered that the significance of these tumours had to be assessed against a background of severe inflammation, which exceeded that found in inhalation carcinogenicity studieswith chemicals that were directly irritant to the nasal tissue. It was unclear from the HLS malathionPT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 163Annual Report 2003 164study in F344 rats to what extent inhalation of food particles contributed to the induction of this inflammatory response in this study. The Committee agreed that direct irritant effects on the nasalpassages was possible when animals were fed powdered diets. It was noted that the food pots used inthe malathion study had some degree of covering which might have limited inhalation of foodparticles. It was noted that there was clear evidence to show the effect of food particles in theinduction of localised inflammation of the nasal passages and the lungs in the malaoxon bioassay inF344 rats undertaken at the same laboratory as the critical malathion F344 rat bioassay. The Committeeconsidered that the proposal from the data holder that de-esterification of malathion in nasal tissue to form acids was also potentially plausible. It was noted that nasal tissue would have appropriate metabolic capacity to metabolise malathion to its corresponding diacid metabolites. The Committeediscussed the possibility of a genotoxic mechanism in the induction of nasal tumours. However theweight of evidence including the formation of tumours only at excessive doses, the evidence for severe prolonged localised inflammation in the target tissue, and the lack of multi-organ responsesuggested that a non-genotoxic mechanism was probable in this instance. Liver tumours in F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice 40. The Peer review pathology report of the Huntingdon Life Sciences bioassay in F344 rats conducted between 1993 and 1996 reported a consensus incidence of 5/70 (7.1%) hepatocellular adenomas infemales at ppm (ca 868 mg/kg bw/ day) 74. The historical control incidence for the laboratory was 0-5.4% ( n= 254). The Peer review report noted that there were a number of non-neoplastic microscopic findings in the five animals with tumours, which included hypertrophy,congestion and vacuoloation. The COC agreed that the time of death and liver pathology seen in these animals would appear to be generally consistent with ageing pathology in this strain of rat. Therewas a significant increase in mortality in the female high dose group from month 18 to 24 (above that seen in controls) resulting in limited numbers of animals available at terminal sacrifice and thus thepossibility existed that there might be some animals which could have developed liver tumours beingmissed. However there was no evidence of a dose response in females and only one hepatocellularadenoma was found in treated males (in a high dose male). All the available pathology evidencesuggested that these tumours are most likely to be an effect of malathion on the backgroundpathology of ageing F344 rats and are unlikely to be of significance for human health. 41. The COC commented that the increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in male and female B6C3F1 mice was associated with clearly overt increases in liver weight and hepatocellularhypertrophy and are unlikely to be significant to humans. It was suggested that, given the evidenceforhepatocellular hypertrophy induced at doses exceeding the MTD, that it was highly likely that these tumours were induced through a non-genotoxic mechanism of technical grade malathion. Overall evaluation of malaoxon 42. The Committee concluded that there was no evidence for a carcinogenic effect of malaoxon, the main metabolite of malathion. PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 164165COC conclusion 43. The COC drew the following overall conclusion: i. The COC agreed that technical grade malathion had been tested in four long-term dietary bioassays in rats and two long-term dietary bioassays in mice. The most recent studiesundertaken in F344 rats (1993-96) and in B6C3F1 mice (1992-94) were adequate for the evaluationof carcinogenicity. There is evidence for tumourigenicity in the nasal tissue and liver (femalesonly) of F344 to rats fed malathion. The nasal tumours were associated with severe ongoinginflammation, which is most likely involved in the mechanism of tumourigenesis. There wasevidence for liver tumours in female F344 rats and male and female B6C3F1 mice. The weight of evidence suggested that these liver tumours were induced through a non-genotoxicmechanism and were not relevant to human health. Overall conclusion: Mutagenicity and Carcinogenicity of Malathion 44. The Committees agreed the following overall conclusion: i. Technical grade malathion is mutagenic in-vitro . The observed activity is due to malathion, its metabolites and impurities. ii. The evidence from mutagenicity studies suggests technical grade malathion is not mutagenic in rats by the oral route. There is a need for a further in-vivo oral rat liver UDS assay with technical grade material supplied in the UK. Negative results in such an assay would provide full reassurancewith regard to oral exposure of rats to technical grade malathion. iii. There is good evidence from published studies that technical grade malathion is mutagenic in mice following intraperitoneal administration and some limited evidence for mutagenicity inmice following oral and dermal administration. These data may indicate a species-specificin-vivo mutagenicity in mice. The Committee recommends that a further study using dermal administration in mice is appropriate to adequately assess the potential for mutagenicity bythis route of exposure as this is particularly relevant to humans. iv. Technical grade malathion has been shown to induce benign tumours at high oral doses which were above the Maximum Tolerated Dose in rats (nasal tissue and liver (females only) and in mice (liver) following administration via the diet in long term bioassays. The nasal tumours wereassociated with severe ongoing inflammation, which is most likely involved in the mechanismof tumourigenesis. The weight of evidence suggested that the liver tumours were not relevant tohuman health. The Committees concluded that the nasal and liver tumours were induced bynon-genotoxic mechanisms.

PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 172173Introduction 1. 2-Phenylphenol and its sodium salt are broad spectrum fungicides that are approved in the UK for use as wood preservatives. They are also used as surface biocides in a number of areas. The COM haveadvised on the mutagenicity of these compounds, specifically in the context of the mechanism of thebladder tumours seen in male rats fed high doses of these compounds, on a number of occasions, themost recent being in 1997. Significant new data are now available. Furthermore an EU review of the useof 2-phenylphenol and its sodium salt in wood preservation is shortly to be initiated under theBiocidal Products Directive (98/8/EC). It would thus be timely to update the COM view on themutagenicity of these compounds. This information would be helpful in developing the UK positionwith regard to the EU in the context of the Biocidal Products Directive. 2. The advice of the COM was thus sought on the mutagenicity of 2-phenylphenol and its sodium salt, and specifically whether the induction of bladder tumours at high dose levels in male rats in thechronic bioassay is likely to have arisen from a genotoxic mechanism. If this were the case the riskassessment would need to adopt a non-threshold approach. Background 3. The COM gave detailed consideration to a comprehensive review of the mutagenicity of 2- phenylphenol in 1992 and agreed the following conclusions: i. Data from several assays to investigate the ability of 2-phenylphenol or its sodium salt to produce gene mutation in Salmonella typhimurium were consistently negative. ii. Positive results were obtained in in-vitro metaphase analysis studies in CHO cells *. Mouse lymphoma assays in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation also gave positive results inthe form of small colonies. These results suggested that a metabolite of 2-phenylphenol hadclastogenic potential. These findings conflicted with an earlier in-vitro metaphase analysis in a single study. iii. Negative results were obtained in bone marrow assays for clastogenicity in vivo and also in germ cells (dominant lethal assay), indicating that any possible clastogenic potential was not expressed in the whole mammal. iv. Conflicting results appeared to be obtained in in-vivo assays for effects on DNA in bladder epithelium, the target tissue of concern. The Committee therefore wished to see data from amore sensitive in-vivo method to investigate adduct formation. There was insufficient evidence to recommend a departure from the use of the safety factor approach for regulation of this compound at the present time.Statement on 2-phenylphenol and its sodium salt *Not included in the 1992 conclusions. The positive results seen in the in vitro metaphase study in CHO cells were in the prese nce of an exogenous metabolic activation system.PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 173Annual Report 2003 1744. In the light of this advice the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) requested further data relating to DNA adduct formation in the urinary bladder epithelium of the male rat with particular emphasis on the dose response relationship at levels known to produce hyperplastic and neoplastic changes inmale rats. 5. In 1997 industry provided these data to the registration authority (HSE) which was referred to COM for an opinion. The following conclusions were drawn by the COM: The Committee expressed concern regarding the limitations of methodology used in the study entitled \" 32P-post-labelling study of technical grade 2-phenylphenol to examine the potential for the formation of DNA adducts in the urinary bladder of the male rat.\" The Committee requested additional analyses of the bladder epithelial samples from this study using an appropriate sensitiveadduct enrichment method for the detection 32P-postlabelled adducts (namely both nuclease P1 and butanol extraction) and appropriate control experiments to evaluate the fate of 2-phenylphenol DNAadducts during the extraction and enrichment procedures. 6. The ACP considered the COM opinion, together with additional data from specialist feeding studies/ carcinogenicity bioassays in 1998 and concluded that the post-review data requirements hadbeen met and confirmed that a threshold based approach remained relevant for risk assessmentpurposes. Consideration of new data published since the comprehensive review in 1992 7. A number of papers relating to the metabolism of 2-phenylphenol and its sodium salt and the production of reactive species were considered together with DNA adduct studies in rat bladderepithelium, mutagenicity data on the quinone metabolites and other data relevant to the mutagenicityof 2-phenylphenol. This new information is summarised below. Metabolism 8. The metabolic profile of 2-phenylphenol is now well established 1, 2, 3. Recent data on the metabolism of 2-phenylphenol in the rat and the mouse confirms that at relatively low dose levels(around 20mg/kg bw/ day) the compound is metabolised and excreted in the urine as sulphate, or to alesser extent, the glucuronide conjugate 1. At higher doses increased levels of conjugates of PHQ were present, but very little non-conjugated PHQ or PBQ. Studies on the comparative metabolism in the ratand the mouse indicate only minor differences 2. It is difficult to see how these could explain the marked species difference in the induction of bladder tumours in the male rat and not the mouse. It ispossible that localised deconjugation of PHQ glucuronide (or sulphate) may play a role at high doselevels in the male rat 2.PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 174175Formation of DNA adducts in male rat bladder epithelium 9. Further data are now available on the ability of 2-phenylphenol or its sodium salt to induce DNA adducts in the rat bladder in vivo . The earlier studies had given conflicting results, with negative results using radioactivity detection following a very high acute exposure with 14C-2-phenylphenol, but positive results using 32P-postlabelling in a subchronic dietary study using a single high dose level (2%) and examining total bladder DNA (rather than epithelial DNA)4,5. 10. The study considered by the COM in 1997, and criticised because of its insensitivity, has now been published, and a rationale for the chosen methodology was given6)The Committee did not agree with this and maintained their view that an appropriate sensitive enrichment method for the detection of 32P-post-labelled adducts should have been used. However a study to investigate both DNA and protein binding in the liver, kidney and bladder of male F344 rats has now been published using thehighly sensitive AMS technique 7. An extensive dose response was investigated, (6 single doses by gavage over the range 15-1000mg/kg 2-phenylphenol). A clear dose-related and essentially linearresponse was seen with protein binding in the liver and kidney, but protein binding was seen in the bladder only at high dose levels (about 500mg/kg and above). There was no evidence for DNAbinding at any dose level in bladder tissue. 11. The Committee agreed that the weight of evidence from in-vivo studies is now sufficient to conclude that 2-phenylphenol does not produce significant DNA binding in the male rat bladder. However most of the available data were from short term studies and the one, limited, subchronicstudy had provided some evidence of adduct formation in bladder DNA. The Committee thus feltthat the possibility of prolonged high level exposure producing DNA adducts could not beentirely discounted. Genotoxicity of PHQ and PBQ 12. A number of studies have investigated the ability of the PHQ or PBQ metabolites to induce chromosome damage, micronuclei or DNA damage in HL60 or V79 cells 8,9,10. There was also some evidence for the induction of aneuploidy8. Positive results were obtained, sometimes only in the presence of arachidonic acid supplementation. Members noted that these cells were readily stimulatedto generate an oxidative environment. The relevance of positive data with high concentrations of metabolites rather than the parent compound, was felt to be questionable. Members felt that it was notpossible to exclude oxidative damage arising from PBQ or PHQ contributing to the induction of bladdertumours at high dose levels, but they agreed that such effects would not be expected to occur at lowdose levels. Additional In-vivo Mutagenicity Data 13. Members considered data from a study to investigate micronucleus induction cell proliferation and hyperdiploidy in bladder epithelium cells of rats treated with 2-phenylphenol at 2% in the diet 11. An increase in micronuclei, but no effect on chromosome number, was reported. However, in view of thelimitations of this study, particularly the failure to be able to distinguish micronuclei from cell debris,it was felt that no conclusions could be drawn from the reported micronucleus induction.PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 175Annual Report 2003 17614. The Committee also considered the results obtained in a study in rats to investigate DNA damage in stomach, liver, kidney, bladder, brain and bone marrow using a modified version of the COMET assaybased on isolated nuclei 12. The results were suggestive of high dose activity in the stomach, liver, kidney and lung but not the bladder. There were concerns however as to whether the method used atthat time would have adequately distinguished between genotoxicity and cytotoxicity, and it was feltthat no definite conclusions could be drawn. Conclusions 15. The Committee agreed the following overall conclusions regarding the mutagenicity of 2- phenylphenol and its sodium salt: i. Data from several assays to investigate the ability of 2-phenylphenol or its sodium salt to produce gene mutation in Salmonella typhimurium were consistently negative. ii. Positive results were obtained in in-vitro metaphase analysis studies in CHO cells and also in mouse lymphoma assays in both cases in the presence of an exogenous metabolic activationsystem. The induction of small colonies in the latter assay is consistent with the compound havingclastogenic potential. iii. Phenylhydroquinone (PHQ) and phenylbenzoquinone (PBQ), which of 2- phenylphenol, PHQ usually present as conjugates, have been shown to produce oxidative DNAdamage and single strand DNA breaks in-vitro using HL60 and V-79 cells. iv. Negative results were obtained in bone marrow assays for clastogenicity in-vivo and also in germ cells (dominant lethal assay), suggesting that any possible clastogenic potential was not expressed in the whole mammal. v. The weight of evidence from in-vivo studies to investigate 2-phenylphenol binding to DNA in the male rat bladder was negative: a recent study using a highly sensitive AMS techniques wasparticularly important in this regard. However the possibility of prolonged high level exposureproducing DNA adducts cannot be entirely discounted. vi. Although a contributory role of oxidative DNA damage cannot be excluded when considering the mechanisms of bladder tumour induction in the male rat, this would not be expected to occur atlow dose levels. vii. The committee concluded that it would be reasonable to adopt a threshold based risk assessment for 2-phenylphenol and its sodium salt.

The advice of the COM previously has been that compounds that are clearly positive in any in-vivo mutagenicity assay should be regarded as mammalian mutagens (and hence potential genotoxiccarcinogens) 1. (http://www.doh.gov.uk/ com/guidance.pdf). Furthermore the COM consider that for such compounds it is prudent to assume that there is no threshold for their mutagenic activity,unless appropriate mechanistic data can be provided to identify a threshold related mechanism,e.g. induction of aneuploidy, where the site of initial action is not DNA but the spindle apparatus 2. (http://www.doh.gov.uk/ comivm.htm). Such mechanistic data are rarely available. 2. This approach has major implications with regard to risk assessment of such chemicals, with the assumption that there is no 'safe' level and that any exposure results in some increased healthdetriment, albeit this may be very small. 3. In practice this means that much weight is placed on the in-vivo genotoxicity assays recommended by the COM in their strategy of testing, in particular on one of the bone marrow assays for clastogenicity (usually the micronucleus test) which is usually the initial assay investigated.Apositive in one of these assays results in the compound being considered as an in-vivo mutagen. It is thus especially important that such decisions are based on sound data, and that the positiveresults truly reflect in-vivo mutagenic activity. In some cases such positive results in the bone marrow assays have only been seen at high dose levels associated with severe toxicity including lethality, givingrise to concern at the relevance of the results. This is particularly true if the overall weight of evidencefrom the in-vivo data, including the results of carcinogenicity bioassays, is not supportive of the compound being an in-vivo genotoxin. 4. Furthermore it is now recognised that in the case of the in-vivo micronucleus test, micronuclei can be induced by mechanisms such as hypothermia, hyperthermia, stimulation of erythropoiesis andpossibly indirectly due to severe cytotoxicity in the bone marrow. In such cases the positive results,if not supported by other in-vivo data, may be regarded as artefacts, which do not reflect mutagenicity of the compound itself in animals. 5. Draft COM guidance on the interpretation of in-vivo bone marrow mutagenicity data that may give rise to concern with regard to being a 'false positive' is provided in this document.Statement on guidance on considering high dose positive in-vivo mutagenicity data in the bone marrow assays that may not be biologicallysignificant with regard to considering a chemicalto be an mutagenicity data 6. The COM guidance on a strategy for testing chemicals for mutagenicity is based on the identification of compounds with mutagenic potential on the basis of a small number of well conducted in-vitro tests. This is followed by establishing whether activity seen in-vitro can be expressed in-vivo in somatic cells, to establish whether the compound can be regarded as an in-vivo somatic cell mutagen and hence a potential carcinogen. In the initial in-vitro testing it is recognised in the guidelines that artifactual positives may be obtained in the mammalian cell assays which do not reflect intrinsicmutagenic activity, and that this uncertainty may be resolved by in-vivo assays, and specifically the bone marrow assays for clastogenicity. Until recently there has been little consideration as towhether artifactual positive results can also be obtained in the in-vivo bone marrow assays. 7. However it is now known that effects such as hyperthermia 3,4or hypothermia5,6, which can be produced as a secondary toxic effect at high dose levels with certain compounds, can producemicronuclei in bone marrow cells in-vivo . Another possible mechanism is the induction of erythropoiesis. This was demonstrated following unexpected positive results in the bone marrowmicronucleus test with a series of recombinant human erythropoietin products; similar effects werelater shown with native erythropoietin 7,8,9. The induction of micronuclei by such non-DNA reactive compounds has been shown to be due to the accelerated proliferation and differentiation of erythrocytes and promotion of early release of PCEs resulting in the micronucleated PCEs. 8. Another possible mechanism is excessive toxicity at high dose levels, associated with severe toxicity including lethality, i.e. higher levels than recommended in the current OECD guidelines. Such 'highdose' studies may possibly give positive results due to the severe toxicity seen in the bone marrow.Thus there are a number of reasons why the in-vivo data may not indicate that the compound is an in-vivo mutagen but further information would be needed to draw any definite conclusions. 9. In considering whether positive results in in-vivo bone marrow mutagenicity data may be caused by factors other than mutagenicity of the compound itself, or its metabolites, it is important to consider all the available data regarding the mutagenic profile of the chemical and whether the hypothesis thatit is not an in-vivo mutagen is biologically plausible. This will include information on relationships, data from in-vitro mutagenicity assays, other in-vivo mutagenicity data, information on toxicokinetics of the substances and any available data from carcinogenicity bioassays. Each compound needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis. 10. An important consideration with regard to data from bone marrow assays for clastogenicity (metaphase analysis or micronuclei) is the highest dose level used. The guidance in the current OECDguidelines is that the top dose should produce signs of toxicity such that higher dose levels, basedon the same dosing regime, would be expected to produce lethality (or for non-toxic compounds itshould be set at a limit dose of 2 grams/kg for single doses and 1 gram/kg for multiple dosingregimes) 10. In the past considerably higher dose levels have been used, and on occasions the relevance of such data needs to be assessed. In the most extreme case, when positive results have beenPT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 179Annual Report 2003 180obtained only at highly toxic or lethal dose levels, the Committee believe that the results obtained are confounded by toxicity and cannot be interpreted with any certainty in these circumstances; it is thus necessary to repeat the test using lower, more appropriate dose levels. It may, however, be possible toutilise the available data from the lower dose levels, together with other relevant information, toenable the isolated high dose in-vivo positive data to be discounted. Consideration of carcinogenicity data (if available) 11. The implications of mutagenicity data with regard to carcinogenicity was considered in some detail in the 1989 COM guidelines for the testing of chemicals for mutagenicity and also in the 1991 COCguidelines on the evaluation of chemicals for carcinogenicity 11,12. At that time both committees concluded that it was reasonable and prudent to regard compounds that were mutagens in-vivo in the somatic cell assays recommended by the COM to also have carcinogenic potential even though suchpotential had not been examined or had not been demonstrated in formal carcinogenicity tests. 12. The updated COM guidelines on a strategy for testing chemicals for mutagenicity published in December 2000 endorsed the view that in-vivo somatic cell mutagens should be regarded as potential carcinogens 1. These conclusions have implications with regard to the testing of chemicals for carcinogenicity. The need to use large numbers of animals in carcinogenicity bioassays on compoundsthat were clear in-vivo somatic cell mutagens is unlikely to be justified; this is recognised in the 1991 COC guidelines. The COC is currently updating its guidance on risk assessment of carcinogens. 13. These conclusions also have implications regarding how carcinogenicity bioassay data that are not supportive of a compound being a genotoxic carcinogen may be used to assist in the interpretation ofin-vivo mutation data when there is concern about the relevance of such data. 14. On occasions in the past the COM have used negative data from carcinogenicity bioassays in this way. An example was the chemical incapacitant CS (2-chlorobenzylidene malonitrile). This compound ismutagenic in-vitro inducing both clastogenic and aneugenic effects in mammalian cells. Although there were negative results from in-vivo bone marrow micronucleus assays it was noted that no data were available to indicate whether adequate amounts of CS, or short-lived reactive metabolites, reached the target organ. Data from DNA binding studies in the liver and kidney did not help with regard toconcerns in tissues of initial contact due to the direct acting mutagenic potential. However the COM took into account the negative carcinogenicity bioassay data from the NTP programme comprising inhalation studies in the rat and the mouse 13. The advice from the COC was that these assays had been adequately conduced and were negative. The COM agreed these negative data provided reassurancesthat the in-vitro effects seen with CS do not occur in-vivo at the site of initialcontact in animals. (Full information can be found at www.doh.gov.uk/ cot/ csgas/htm.) 15. Thus consideration of the results from carcinogenicity bioassays, if available, is important when assessing the overall weight of evidence as to whether the compound should be regarded as an in-vivo mutagen. In this regard an assessment needs to be made as to whether the carcinogenicity data areconsistent with the compound being a genotoxic carcinogen. Alternatively the tumour profile may bePT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 180181suggestive of a non-genotoxic mechanism of chemical carcinogenesis, or that the chemical is not carcinogenic. Consideration may need to be taken of any difference in dose levels used but it must berecognised that the difference in duration of the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity bioassays will severely limit the utility of any comparison. However, consideration of the available information onthe toxicokinetics of the compound will often be useful. 16. It is not possible to give more than generic guidance in this area, as each compound will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. Expert judgement will be needed with particular consideration of a number of key points that are summarised in the conclusions. Conclusions 17. The following points need to be considered when deciding whether positive in-vivo bone marrow clastogenicity data can be discounted with regard to considering a compound as an in-vivo mutagen: i) The totality of the relevant data relating to the specific compound in question needs to be considered, including any information on its chemical reactivity, toxicokinetics, its mutagenic profile ( in-vitro and also any available data from carcinogenicity bioassays to enable an assessment to be made as to whether the compound appears to be a genotoxic carcinogen. ii) Positive bone marrow in-vivo mutagenicity data from dose levels that are associated with high levels of toxicity or lethality (i.e. above the maximum dose level recommended in the current OECDguidelines) cannot be interpreted with any certainty because of the confounding effects of toxicity.If adequate information is not available at lower, non-lethal dose levels then retesting is necessary. iii) It is also important to consider whether there is any evidence for a plausible mechanism to support the contention that the observed positive results in the bone marrow assays at high doselevels may be secondary to other non-genotoxic effects rather than being a mutagenic effect ofthe compound (or its metabolites). Examples of such mechanisms include (but are not limited to)hypothermia, hyperthermia, and erythropoiesis. iv) Data from adequately conducted carcinogenicity bioassays, if available, provide important information to help in the assessment of the significance of such high dose bone marrow mutagenicity results. Such data may indicate that the carcinogenic profile of the chemical is consistent with either agenotoxic or a non-genotoxic mechanism, or that the compound is not carcinogenic. v) Only generic advice can be given in this area and it should be emphasised that each compound needs to be considered in a case-by-case basis. However consideration of the above factors, withexpert judgement, may provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the positive in-vivo bone marrow data at high dose levels was due to a non-genotoxic effect. A threshold based riskassessment may thus be appropriate. COM/03/S5 November 2003 PT2 3rd 18/5/04 12:16 Page 181Annual Report 2003 182References 1. COM.
