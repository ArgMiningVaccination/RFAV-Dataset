Selenium: a dietary mineral essential for chemical reactions in the brain and other parts of the body Sensitive subpopulation: people who may be more vulnerable to exposure to an environmental exposure, whether a biological, physical or chemical agent; commonly refers to infants and children, elderly and people with compromised immune systems Sentinel lymph node: the first lymph node where cancer spreads Signaling: a complex system of communication that governs basic cellular activities and coordinates cell actions; errors in cellular information processing are responsible for diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity and diabetes. The ability of cells to perceive and correctly respond to their micro-environment is critical to development, tissue repair, immunity and homeostasis. Somatic mutations: alterations in the DNA that are not transmitted to the offspring; distinguished from germ line mutations which can be transmitted to descendants Somatomedin: see insulin-like growth factor Statistical significance: based on probabilities, the observed outcome is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone; statistical evidence of a difference Stress: disturbance of physiologic equilibrium Stress hormones: such as cortisol and norepinephrine are released during periods of high stress; the hormone regulating system is known as the endocrine system Stromal: pertaining to the connective tissue of an organ, gland or other structure Susceptible/susceptibility: a term used to describe a person(s) who is more likely to develop a disease; at risk of disease T T cell: a type of white blood cell that attacks damaged cells, including cancer cells Target population: particular group of people selected for study, intervention, education, etc. Telomerase: an enzyme which mediates the repair or preservation of terminal sequences of chromosomes Terminal ductal lobular unit (TDLU): alveolar-lobular structure which forms the functional unit of the human breast; changes with hormonal events such as puberty, pregnancy and lactation. Terminal end buds: structures at the tips of invading primary ducts in the developing mammary gland Thelarche: the beginning of breast development in the female Threshold dose response: a type of response in which, at very low exposures, there appears to be no detectable increased risk of disease; there is a threshold below which no risk is detected Tissue: a group or layer of cells, such as the skin, that together performs specific functions Titration: a procedure to determine the lowest antibody concentration needed to produce effective staining of given structures with minimal background Toxicology: the study of the effects of physical and chemical agents on living organisms Transcriptional: relating to the transfer of genetic information from one kind of nucleic acid to another; for example, from DNA to RNA Transgenic: referring to an organism in which new DNA has been introduced into the germ (reproductive) cells by injecting it into the nucleus of the ovum Tumor: an abnormal mass of tissue that results from uncontrolled cell division; can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) Tumor suppressor genes: or \"cell guardians\" - genes whose normal function is to prevent abnormal cells from dividing; certain mutations in tumor suppressor genes lead to cancer U UV: ultraviolet light V Vascular: relating to or including blood vessels; the vascular system includes the arteries, veins and capillaries that carry blood to and from the heart VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor): responsible for the growth of blood vessels Virus: parasitic microorganisms capable of causing disease; smaller than a single cell or bacterium, they cannot reproduce outside a living organism W Water contaminant: anything found in water (including microorganisms, radionuclides, chemicals, minerals, etc.) which may be harmful to human health - Inorganic contaminants are mineral-based compounds such as metals, nitrates, and asbestos, which are naturally occurring in some water, but can also enter water through human activities. - Organic contaminants are carbon-based chemicals, such as solvents and pesticides, which enter water through cropland runoff, discharge from factories, and other means. Whole mounts: a preparation in which a sample of tissue (e.g., the entire breast) is examined for structure, type and frequency of lesions and other measurable parameters X Xenobiotic: an environmental compound; outside the body Xenografts: a type of tissue graft in which the donor and recipient are of different species "}
