A new proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated with four ingredients; a mixture of the minerals (zinc, magnesium, and selenium) and the herbal root extract ashwagandha. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of Biofield Energy Healing (The Trivedi Effect\u00ae) on the herbomineral formulation in male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The test formulation was divided into two parts. One part was denoted as the control without any Biofield Energy Treatment, while the other part was defined as the Biofield Energy Treated sample, which received the Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment remotely from eighteen renowned Biofield Energy Healers. The immunomodulatory effect of the Biofield Energy Treated and untreated test formulations was studied in SD rats to determine any alteration in humoral immune response (IgG and IgM), cellular immune response, hematological parameters, lipid profile, hepatic enzymes, and the sex hormone (testosterone). The ratio of CD4 /CD8 was significantly increased by 51.98% and 12.99% (p0.05) in the Biofield Energy Treated (G3) and untreated test formulations (G4), respectively compared with the disease control group (G2). The level of IgM was significantly increased by 28.57% in the G3 group, while decreased by 14.29% in the G4 group compared with the G2 group. The eosinophil count was significantly increased by 27.27% in the G3 group, while decreased by 18.18% in the G4 group compared with the G2 group. The levels of triglycerides (TG) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) were reduced by 8.99% and 9.12%, respectively in the G3 group compared with the G2 group. However, the levels of TG and VLDL were reduced by 2.40% and 3.46%, respectively in the G4 group compared with the G2 group. Among the tested hepatic parameters, results showed decreased 7.67%, in the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation group (G3) compared to the G2 group. The level of testosterone was significantly increased by 22.02% in the G3 group compared with G2 group. The overall results demonstrated that the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation showed better immune response compared with the untreated test formulation. These data suggest that the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation can be used for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, stress management and anti-aging by improving overall health.
