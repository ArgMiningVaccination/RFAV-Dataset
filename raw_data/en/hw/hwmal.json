Oriental Art of Healing Acupuncture and Herb Clinics provide top quality services of acupuncture, Chinese herb medicine, Qigong and other traditional Chinese health care in Denver, CO and Houston, Katy, TX. Known as one of the best acupuncture and Chinese medicine clinics in metro Denver and Houston communities, our offices offer not only the professional health care, but also a cozy home environment to relax. The acupuncture needles we use are sterile, individually-packed, and disposable. To meet the diversity of needs from our health seekers, the offices offer various Chinese healing services including acupuncture (classical and electrical), auricular (ear) acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping, acupressure, Chinese herbal medicine, and medical Qigong (also known as Dao Yin). Considering the complexity of human body and multi-factors involved in the development of human illnesses, our treatment regimens also address the essential health-relating issues, such as diet, life style, living and working environment and emotional -personality profiles. We carefully observe and study on each case, looking for any earliest subclinical signs (that predict the underlying serious health concerns) and treat them in advance and provide the patients with prevention advice accordingly. Our patients are not only from the Denver and Houston metropolitan, Katy and Memorial City areas, but also from the distant cities and towns; some patients are from other states such as Louisiana, Florida, Wyoming, New Mexico, Oklahoma and California. We take gracious care of people and are glad to work together with you for your healthier and happier life.
