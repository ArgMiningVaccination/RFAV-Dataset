As part of these actions, FDA has tested the chemical content of cannabinoid compounds in some of the products, and many were found to not contain the levels of CBD they claimed to contain. It is important to note that these products are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease. Consumers should beware purchasing and using any such products. |Firm||State||Purchase Website| Pharmaceuticals, LLC](/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/new-leaf-pharmaceuticals-llc-609744-12222020) [NextL3vel Services Group, LLC dba This Stuff Is | |[For Our Vets LLC "}
