Edited May 2005. Practitioners of integrative medicine recognize that health is more than the absence of disease and that a multi-disciplinary approach to medicine often provides the maximum therapeutic benefit. Dr. David P. Sniezek, DC, MD, MBA, Lic Acup is an integrative medical practitioner with the following designations: Medical Doctor, Doctor of Chiropractic, and Medical Acupuncturist. Dr. Sniezek is a pioneer in the newly developed field of integrative rehabilitation medicine and has been recognized as a Washingtonian Magazine \"Top Doctor\" in Rehabilitation Medicine for over 15 years. Unlike some integrated practices (with many providers sharing one office), Dr. Sniezek is an integrative health provider trained in multiple disciplines. This saves you time and money, not to mention the distinct advantage of being able to benefit from this combined knowledge, skill, and experience in one visit! Integrative medicine combines the discipline of modern science with the wisdom of ancient healing. For people living with chronic or life-threatening illnesses, integrative medicine and rehabilitation can transform the physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of their lives. Integrative treatment may also be valuable to those who are not ill but wish to increase self-awareness, enhance well-being, and help prevent health-related problems. In treating disease, complementary integrative therapies are not substitutes for mainstream medical care; they are used in concert with medical treatment to help alleviate stress, reduce pain and anxiety, manage symptoms, and promote a feeling of well-being. Dr. Sniezek is a Diplomate and Fellow of the American Association of Integrative Medicine. NUTRITIONAL MEDICINE is based on the principle that nutrients, including essential micronutrients, are required for the proper functioning of all the biochemical processes on which our bodies depend. Therefore, when treating symptoms or diseases, we look for the underlying causes which, although often partly genetic, are usually very much tied up with nutritional and environmental factors. This is in contrast to the tendency in the conventional medical approach to treat symptoms by means of drugs or surgery.
