Historically, the NEORFC has focused its support on the activities and operations specific to Cleveland and other urban jurisdictions, creating a gap due to the unbalanced attention on urban areas. Public safety entities play the primary role in security, planning, and required threat mitigation for public events, activities, schools, etc. These local agencies have the greatest awareness of, and ability to report organizations or persons who may become a potential threat to their communities. Under this proposal, Preventing and Assessing Rural Threats for First Responders (PART), the NEORFC will work with the Begun Center at Case Western Reserve University to engage rural agencies by establishing an Advisory Board, provide training to identify b)(7)(E) I violent extremism specific to rural areas, and for events and activities within local jurisdictions. PART will focus on (1)(7)(E) and training that can assist public safety personnel before attacks occur while improving collaboration and information sharing across Northeast Ohio. Applicant: Case Western Reserve University Location: Cleveland, Ohio Location of Activities: Lake County, Ashtabula County, Geauga County, Ohio Application Track: Replication Track Project Type: Training and Awareness Raising Amount of Funds Requested: $184,981 Application Contents Cover Page 1 Body 2 Needs Assessment 2 Program Design 3 Organization and Key Personnel 5 Sustainability 5 Budget Detail and Narrative 6 References 7 Appendix A: Implementation and Measurement Plan 8 Appendix B: Resumes and Curriculum Vitae 16 Appendix C: Letters of Support and Commitment 76 (b)(7)(E) 1 1. Needs Assessment Extremism in Ohio. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), in 2019 there were 31 hate groups present in Ohio, eight of which are statewide organizations and six are considered national headquarters located in Ohio.' These groups include Anti-LGBTQ, Anti-Muslim, Black Separatist, Ku Klux Clan, Neo-Nazi and White Nationalist groups.' Nine of the organizations listed by SPLC are present in Northeast Ohio and fall within the area of responsibility (AOR) of the NEORFC which consists of Cuyahoga, Lorain, Geauga, Ashtabula and Lake Counties. According to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, Ohio ranks 8th nationally for the number of individuals radicalized in the United States.2IQb)(4) _I (b)(4) Of the 24 individuals, five were either located in, or conspired to conduct attacks in Northeast Ohio.3 From 2000 to 2018, Ohio experienced 14 active shooter events, four of which occurred in rural areas and five occurred in Northeast Ohio, to include one event in Geauga County in 2012 and one in Ashtabula County in 2003.4 Ohio experienced the second highest number of casualties (nine killed, 27 wounded) in the United States in 2019 for mass killings at the Oregon Historic District in Dayton.' The NEORFC's Area of Responsibility(AOR). Geauga, Lake and Ashtabula will be the targeted counties for this program; all three are predominantly white populations and are all considered rural as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture. Ashtabula County is 93% white (11.1% higher than the Ohio average), Geauga County is 96.9% white and Lake County's population is 91.8% white.6 The racial demographics of these counties are vastly different than NEORFCs primary area of focus in Cuyahoga County and the City of Cleveland, which is primarily urban and only 63% white.6 Target Audience. The target audience for this proposal, which is titled Preventing and Assessing Rural Threats for First Responders (PART), will be public safety agencies of the aforementioned three rural counties, to include law enforcement, fire service and emergency management. The priority group of trainees will be law enforcement personnel who conduct planning and/or provide security for critical infrastructure, public events and other mass gatherings, and school security or school events. Of the law enforcement entities within these three counties, the County Sheriff Departments will be the most pertinent training recipients, as they are the primary law enforcement agency and first responders for the most rural areas. Additionally, the Sheriff Departments typically provide security services and support to school activities and other large gatherings and events such as annual County Fairs. Program History. The NEORFC has coordinated and provided training opportunities for law enforcement and first responder personnel across their AOR in the past, to include Active Shooter Emergency Response and Transit Terrorist Tools and Tactics training in 2015 and an Active Threat Integrated Response Course in 2018.3 These courses primarily emphasized reactive tactics to mass casualty events or provided specific response techniques and protocols for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) attacks. PART will focus on the development of tools and training that can assist public safety personnel in (b)(7)(E) and indicators before attacks occur. (b)(4) 2 2. Program Design Problem Statement. Historically, the NEORFC has focused its support on the activities and operations specific to Cleveland and other urban jurisdictions, creating a gap due to the unbalanced attention on urban areas NEORFC covers. Local law enforcement in these rural counties have reported previous training offered on targeted violence, domestic terrorism and violent extremism has lacked applicability to rural public safety entities. Additionally, there is a general lack of knowledge regarding the NEORFCs roles, responsibilities and capabilities as well as a significant gap in reporting and communication to and from NEORFC and its local rural partners. According to the NEORFC, the three targeted counties for PART combine for less than (b)(7)(E) (b)(7)(E) Solution. The NEORFC and the Begun Center for Violence Prevention Research and Education (Begun Center) at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) will work in collaboration to close the gap between the AOR rural counties and the NEORFC with this PART proposal. PART will utilize an Advisory Board consisting of law enforcement, mental health, and other safety personnel to inform a well-rounded training program and structure for the rural AOR. The PART training program will be developed by adapting components of existing targeted violence and terrorism prevention training (i.e. DHS Law Enforcement Awareness Lab) and will include a train-the-trainer (TtT) option. PART will also create a rural-focused (b)(7)(E) (b)(7)(E) (b)(7)(E) PART Training will focus on these four key learning objectives: 1.Understand the capabilities and resources offered by the NEORFC. 2.Identify community threat groups or individuals who show signs of violent extremism. 3.Gain knowledge of effective engagement and referrals for persons exhibiting violent extremist behaviors. 4.Recognize the importance and value of information sharing and (b)(7)(E) PART Training will be conducted by subject matter experts (SME) and accomplished in a one- day period (see Table 1). PART training will be delivered twice each year to an audience of approximately 100 personnel for each event; two separate TtT events will be offered in each calendar year. The training program and tools will be continuously evaluated and modified based on feedback. All products created will be published and made available for use for all law enforcement or public safety personnel nationally (DHS Law Enforcement Awareness Briefing). Table 1.

Program Goal: Increase the ability to identify, mitigate and report violent extremism threats within the rural area of responsibilities of the Northeast Ohio Regional Fusion Center. Objective 1: Identify threats in rural communities. Conduct a needs assessment during the first three months of the award period to identify rural-specific threats and review available TVTP related training curriculums. Objective 2: Develop a b)(7)(E) award period, create the b)(7)(E) Objective 3: Provide training to public safety personnel. Conduct two training events (-100 personnel in each event). Conduct one TtT course each year (5-10 trainees annually). Objective 4: Evaluate training and reporting protocols. CWRU will evaluate the PART program for effectiveness through a) 2 post-training surveys per year, and b) feedback on the b)(7)(E) Ifrom rural partners to NEORFC. Objective 5: Provide rural-focused training and for sustainability and replicability. During the final four months of the award period, NEORFC and CWRU will utilize feedback and evaluation results to publish a finished rural-specific TVTP training program an hat will be disseminated nationally (DHS LAB). Logic Model. Theory of Change: PART will improve collaboration and information sharing about violent extremism and possible terrorist threats by developing tools, curricula and a sustainable training framework that can assist law enforcement and first responder personnel in rural Northeast Ohio counties. Table 2. PART Training Logic Model kb)(7)(E) Contextual Factors and Underlying Assumptions: We anticipate the possibility of having to address factors that could possibly influence the successful implementation of PART. First, we recognize that the participation of key stakeholders is critical to the success of PART and thus will convene an Advisory Group consisting of representatives from law enforcement, first responder and mental health agencies. Second, in order to avoid low participation at PART trainings, we will work closely with the training liaisons at County Sherriff Departments to develop marketing and recruitment strategies. Third, we will attempt to lessen the possibility of a low response rate to the post-training online survey by using CWRU online survey software to continually monitor response rate statistics and utilize tools to engage non-respondents. Fourth, During the first six months of the (b)(7)(E) (b)(7)(E) 4 we are aware there is a chance that the situation with COVID-19 will affect our ability to conduct in-person trainings. If this is the case, we are prepared to either conduct remote trainings or work with local and state public officials to develop appropriate protocols for in-person trainings. 3. Organization and Key Personnel Organization. The NEORFCs mission is to enhance inter-agency communications and information sharing among federal, state, and local stakeholders and the public and private sectors in order to anticipate and counter criminal activity, terrorism, and other hazards. The NEORFC relies on receiving information from partners across its AOR in order to fuse, organize and analyze for the production of finished, actionable intelligence to public safety and the intelligence community. The Begun Center for Violence Prevention Research and Education is a research center at Case Western Reserve University. Begun Center faculty have provided violence prevention related implementation training, data collection assistance, technical assistance, and consultation to the Cleveland Division of Police, Cleveland Metropolitan Housing Authority Police, United States Marshal Service, the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, and numerous non-law enforcement agencies for over 20 years (https://case.edu/socialworlc/begun/). Key Personnel. Dr. Daniel Flannery will serve as Principal Investigator for PART and is the Director of the Begun Center. He previously served on the advisory board of the NEORFC. Dr. Flannery will be responsible for overall administrative oversight of the project to include communication with internal and external senior project staff, participation in regular planning meetings, review and development of training materials and reports, and approving data collection methodologies. Ryan McMaster will serve as Project Director. He is the Begun Center's Research Data Manager and a retired USAF Intelligence and Antiterrorism Officer. Mr. McMaster will be responsible for all daily operations of the project, including assisting with developing training protocols, logistics, organizing data collection efforts, completing statistical analyses, writing reports, and serving as a liaison between project and public safety agencies. Dr. Gregory Moore is Professor of History and Intelligence Studies, Director of the Center for Intelligence Studies and the Head of the Department of Public Service and Security Studies at Notre Dame College. Dr. Moore will serve as a consultant and instructor for PART. Dr. Moore will serve as the primary instructor for PART training and will provide SME input for course curriculum development. Patrick Thomas is the Senior Intelligence Analyst for the NEORFC. Mr. Thomas will provide subject matter expertise, assist in the development of the training curriculum and scalable threat assessment tool, and be the lead instructor for PART training. 4. Sustainability The NEORFC possesses the capacity to implement and sustain PART. The costs incurred and funded through this grant will cover the initial work required to develop the training curriculum, course materials, consultant and instructor costs, research and development of threat assessment tools and the costs associated with travel for collaboration with the advisory board.

CWRU maintains the capacity to provide web- based live or recorded training and can make this available to the target audience. Low participation in training events Medium Low participation would significantly impact the program and the intent to raise awareness of all aspects of PARTs training plan and assessment implementation across NEORFCs AOR. PART Team will work closely with training liaisons at the County Sheriff's Departments to develop marketing and recruiting strategies. 15 Appendix B Resumes and Curriculum Vitae 16 OFFICE ADDRESS Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences Case Western Reserve University 11402 Bellflower Cleveland, OH 44116 VITA Daniel J.

The proposed Preventing and Assessing Rural Threats for First Responders (PART) application builds on the urban threat assessment and training measures urgently needed in rural counties and the specific challenges they face with violent extremism. Throughout our response to foreign and domestic targeted violence and terrorism, we have become concerned about the challenges surrounding rural communities, the knowledge and practice of available resources, and risk factors of individuals engaging in targeted violence. The expansion and prevention framework outlined in this proposal will enhance the partners' ability to identify and respond to local threats and broaden local law enforcement and societal awareness through the all- hazards approach provided by the NEORFC. With respect to PART, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio supports the plan to implement training and awareness opportunities for the rural communities focusing on mobilization and radicalization of violent extremists. The participants in PART will be contributing in the following ways: 1.Working cooperatively to build a standardized and scalable threat assessment tool (STA) and suspicious activity reporting (SAR) protocols; 2.Having agency personnel attend PART training(s); 3.Encouraging other local entities to participate in training sessions; 4.Participating in outcome collection measures such as surveys and general feedback; and 5.Continuing to engage with NEORFC on information sharing and train-the-trainer opportunities. 77 The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio will continue to collaborate with the NEORFC and the Begun Center team on this important initiative to effectively address the significant targeted violence and terrorism risks facing local communities.

Expanded training focused on preventing and assessing rural threats for first responders will provide the opportunity to address the specific needs and challenges rural counties face with violent extremism. Throughout our response to foreign and domestic targeted violence and terrorism, we recognize the challenges surrounding rural communities, the knowledge and practice of available resources, and risk factors of individuals engaging in targeted violence. The expansion and prevention framework will enhance the ability to identify and respond to local threats and broaden local law enforcement and societal awareness through the all-hazards approach provided by the Northeast Ohio Regional Fusion Center.

Specifically, we offer our support for the proposed Preventing and Assessing Rural Threats for First Responders (PART) which focuses on strengthening of societal resistance against the drivers of violent extremism and ensure broad awareness of the threat of targeted violence and terrcurism. Part of ATF's mission includes working with local and federal partners to respond to acts of violent extremism motived by foreign or domestic actors. While most ATF responses to acts of violence and terrorism occur in urban areas, we also work closely with rural counterparts as incidents occur. ATF supports the enhancement of awareness and training focused on rural communities so that community members, law enforcement, and service providers have enhanced abilities to identify individuals mobilizing or radicalizing violence. The expansion and prevention framework outlined in the NEORFC proposal will enhance the ability of rural communities to identify and respond to local threats and broaden local law enforcement and societal awareness through the all-hazards approach provided by NEORFC. By enhancing the abilities of the rural communities, ATF believes that this will foster closer coordination and response between federal and local partners to developing threats and incidents should they occur. In closing, ATF is pleased to support the NEORFC application and will work closely with the NEORFC should they receive this grant.

The proposed Preventing and Assessing Rural Threats for First Responders (PART) application builds on the urban threat assessment and training measures urgently needed in our rural county and the specific challenges with violent extremism we face. We are located in a rural County of about 90K people. We have not had many threats or incidents of violence or terrorism. With that being said we know that we are not immune to these types of incidents. We do not have the training that we should have mostly because it has not been offered. We also don't have the equipment needed to handle these types of incidents due to budget issues. We recently discovered that we do need more training and equipment after we were called to the City of Cleveland to assist with their civil unrest. We look forward to improving our skill with the proper equipment that this grant may help to accomplish this. Throughout our response to foreign and domestic targeted violence and terrorism, we have become concerned about the challenges surrounding rural communities, the knowledge and practice of available resources, and risk factors of individuals engaging in targeted violence. The expansion and prevention framework outlined in this proposal will enhance our ability to identify and respond to our local threats and broaden local law enforcement and societal awareness through the all-hazards approach provided by NEORFC. Mission Statement: It is the mission of the Geauga County Sheriff's Office to serve the Courts and the people of Geauga County in the most efficient and equitable way possible, providing, where appropriate, Law Enforcement Patrol, Corrections (Jail), Communications, Records, Investigations and Civil Process Services. 81 With respect to PART, the Geauga County Sheriff's Office supports the plan to participate in training and awareness opportunities for our rural community focusing on mobilization and radicalization of violent extremists. We agree to contribute in the following ways: 1.Provide at least one Sheriff's Office member to serve on the PART Advisory Board to build a standardized and scalable threat assessment tool (STA) and suspicious activity reporting (SAR) protocols 2.Have agency personnel attend PART training(s) in year one and year two 3.Encourage other local entities to participate in training sessions 4.Participate in outcome collection measures such as surveys and general feedback 5.Continue to engage with NEORFC on information sharing and train-the-trainer opportunities We look forward to working with the NEORFC and the Begun Center team on this important initiative to effectively address the significant targeted violence and terrorism risks facing our local community.

The proposed Preventing and Assessing Rural Threats for First Responders (PART) application builds on the urban threat assessment and training measures urgently needed in our rural county and the specific challenges with violent extremism we face. Lake County has great concerns regarding the threat of targeted violence and terrorism. We are home to the Perry nuclear Power Plant facility. As well, we have one of the largest chemical plants on the Northshore of Lake Erie with the Lubrizol Corporation production facility being housed here in both Painesville Township and the City of Wickliffe. Attacks against any of these facilities would have catastrophic consequences in our County. Equally, we must highlight the recent attacks in our cities not only against law enforcement, but the people and property we are charged with protecting. This criminal destruction on property, murder of people on our streets, and massive civil unrest highlight the absolute need for the Northeast Regional Fusion Center to enable asset threat 83 ;b)(6) heriff, ake County Sheriff's Office 104 East Erie Street, Painesville, Ohio 44077 identification and the assistance of information gathering and disbursement across our law enforcement communities.

The Lake County ADAMHS Board has a long standing relationship with our Emergency Management Agency, and we are an integral part of the county's Disaster Response Plan. Further, our ADAMHS Board works closely with local police, fire and first responders, providing ongoing training, education and collaboration. We've provided Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) for first responders throughout Lake County for over 2 decades. We facilitate our Community Alliance of Law Enforcement and Mental Health Services (CALMHS) Committee, which regularly convenes to address issues facing our systems. In 2018 we established our Quick Response Team (QRT), partnering behavioral health and first responders to address substance abuse and help connect individuals with treatment. We recognize the importance of first responders and behavioral health working side by side to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our citizens. The targeted violence and terrorism prevent training and tools outlined in this proposal will enhance our ability to identify and respond to our community needs, coordinate with first responders, and increase societal awareness through the all-hazards approach provided by NEORFC. With respect to PART, the Lake County ADAMHS Board supports the plan to participate in the following ways: 1.Provide at least one ADAMHS Board member to serve on the PART Advisory Board to a) provide input on for the training modules used in the PART training events and b) assist with the development of threat assessment tools and suspicious activity reporting (SAR) protocols. 2.Provide a list of available resources to include in the PART trainings as well as handout materials first responders to refer at-risk individuals. 3.Continue to engage with NEORFC on information sharing and training opportunities.

The proposed training will work to fill a void in threat assessment and training measures that are urgently needed in rural counties for the specific challenges that they face with violent extremism. The NEORFC is one of eighty fusion centers designated and recognized by the Department of Homeland Security. The mission of the NEORFC is to \"enhance the level of inter-agency communications, criminal and intelligence analysis, and information sharing among Federal, State and local stakeholders, and the public and private sectors in order to anticipate and counter criminal activity, terrorism, and other hazards in coordination with the Ohio Fusion Center Network and the Intelligence Community.\" Within our five-county area of responsibility, there is quite a dichotomy between the counties and public safety agencies' role in security, planning, and threat mitigation for public events, activities, and schools. Through our work in recent years, we have recognized that our work and relationships with first responders in the rural counties has suffered due to our focus on the larger urban communities and their potential targets for violent extremism. In partnering with the Begun Center for Violence Prevention Research and Education at Case Western Reserve University, the NEORFC is hoping to improve upon our current work and enhance training in the rural communities which can lead to improved detection, analysis, and deterrence of violent extremist actors and activities.

I am prepared to support the project by providing consultation, subject matter expertise and provide training instruction for PART training events. I have written and taught graduate and undergraduate courses both in traditional face to face and online environments. As an instructor in this field I actively stay current in this area and continuously update my courses to keep them as up to date as possible and would happily share my knowledge in PART training events. As the Director for Intelligence Studies and Chair of the Department of Public Service and Security Studies at Notre Dame College, I have become concerned about the challenges surrounding rural communities, the knowledge and practice of available resources, and risk factors of individuals engaging in targeted violence. The public safety training outlined in this proposal will enhance our ability to identify and respond to our local threats and broaden local law enforcement and societal awareness. I look forward to working with the Begun Center and the Northeast Ohio Regional Fusion Center on this important initiative to effectively address the significant targeted violence and terrorism risks facing our local community.

I am prepared to support the project by providing consultation and access to historical information and current threat reporting that can be shared. As a central hub for information and intelligence sharing I am prepared to assist the project in finding relevant subject matter experts who can assist in creating the most robust training possible. As an Intelligence Analyst with the Northeast Ohio Regional Fusion Center since 2014 I have contributed to the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) by gathering all-source intelligence (open source, tips, leads, and suspicious activity reporting) for our 5-county area of responsibility and synthesizing that information with intelligence from the federal government. In 2019 I was recognized by the Cleveland Division of the FBI for my dedication and contribution to a joint law enforcement operation and am currently a member of the International Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence Analysts. The targeted violence and terrorism prevent training and tools outlined in this proposal will enhance our ability to identify and respond to our community needs, coordinate with first responders, and increase societal awareness through the all- hazards approach encouraged by the Department of Homeland Security.. I look forward to working with the Begun Center and team on this important initiative to effectively address the significant targeted violence and terrorism risks facing our local community.
