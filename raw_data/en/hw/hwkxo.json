New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007 . The theoretical model by Reuben Granich and colleagues1 concludes that a massive scale-up of HIV test-ing with immediate initiation of anti-retroviral therapy could nearly stop HIV transmission. Writing on behalf of a group of advisers to UNAIDS on HIV and human rights, 2 we welcome a model that proposes the attainment of universal access to HIV treatment and HIV testing, and con rms the link between HIV prevention and treatment; these are essential components of the right to health which must be pursued with much greater e orts. Granich and colleagues acknowledge many barriers to implementation, but neglect a crucial issue: whether uni-versal annual testing and immediate treatment can be applied safely and acceptably in the face of widespread HIV-related stigma, discrimination, and human rights abuses. There is abundant evidence that the uptake of HIV prevention and treat-ment programmes is undermined by gender inequality and violence against women, stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV, and the criminalisation or denial of the existence by some governments of populations at high risk of HIV\u2014eg, men who have sex with men, people who use drugs, and sex workers.The model would have been stronger had it costed concrete programmes to reduce these barriers and support people's ability to access services. Without attention to such programmes, the model would not achieve the posited uptake necessary to achieve its goals. If e orts to determine the model's potential are deemed worthy of study, it is imperative that not only HIV testing and treatment be scaled up, but also programmes to protect and promote human rights of people living with and vulnerable to HIV. 3 Additionally, people living with and a ected by HIV should be involved.

They also assume a yearly dropout rate of 1\u00b75%, which would seem overly optimistic for a long-term \"universal\" programme. A sensitivity analysis with these model parameters would have allowed us to see how di erent values might a ect the results qualitatively. Scienti cally, their results merely indicate some possible future scenarios\u2014if antiretroviral therapy strikingly lowers the infectivity of treated patients, if long-term compliance is su ciently high, and if this programme does not lead to signi cantly more risky behaviour by the population owing to a false sense of security. Furthermore, to remedy the inadequacies of implementing a universal testing programme, one could consider the experience of Cuba, where extensive random testing accompanied by contact tracing of infected individuals has resulted in a high HIV detection rate, estimated by two di erent methods at around 77% 3 and 80%,4 respectively. This has resulted in Cuba having a signi cantly lower HIV prevalence than its neighbours in the Caribbean Basin. 5 Moreover, contact tracing is less costly than universal testing, and hence is an ideal complement to large-scale intervention programmes in developing countries.

Ascertaining HIV underreporting in J Biol Systems 2005; 13: 441-54.Reuben Granich and colleagues1 suggest universal HIV testing and immediate treatment of those found positive, which is indeed \"a bold move away\" 2 from the current approach of treatment on the basis of clinical need and prevention through behavioural education. Granich and colleagues' modelling results depend heavily on the validity of assumptions about future or unrealised events.

In their important and provocative article,1 Reuben Granich and colleagues argue that universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate antiretroviral therapy, irrespective of the degree of immune suppression, could eliminate HIV from countries where the infection is highly prevalent. However, we agree with Geo rey Garnett and Rebecca Baggaley 2 that this approach could strongly shift the bene ts of treatment from the individual to the population. Although current HIV treatment guidelines favour earlier treatment, the risks and bene ts of treatment for people with CD4+ cell counts above 350 per L are unknown. Trials of therapy for patients with higher counts are yet to begin. Within the eld of communicable diseases, we are aware of little precedent for the approach of \"treating for the common good\". Treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis might have the e ect of decreasing transmission, but the primary goal is to decrease morbidity and mortality for the a ected person. A better analogy might be found in immunisation programmes\u2014eg, rubella vaccination of infants and children aims to reduce exposure among pregnant women. However, there is still a clear bene t and minimal risk for the individual vaccinee. The World Medical Association international code of medical ethics states that \"A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.\" 3 If we are to deviate from this basic principle, we will need a robust ethical model for balancing individual and societal bene ts.

Reuben Granich and colleagues1 use mathematical models to show that annual screening of most adults for HIV, with immediate commencement of antiretroviral therapy for all infected, would strikingly reduce HIV incidence. The ndings are very interesting. We would like to share our lessons from Ethiopia. Ethiopia had a millennium AIDS campaign with the objective of increasing the number of people tested for HIV through universal voluntary counselling and testing and providing antiretroviral treatment for eligible patients. We were able to increase the number of people tested in 1 year from 560 000 in 2005/06 to 4\u00b76 million in 2007/08. The number of patients started on antiretroviral therapy per month increased from 3500 to more than 5700. 2 Even though we accomplished a lot in terms of HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy provision, we had challenges during the rapid scale-up of these services. We learnt that mass testing is very resource-intensive and needs a strong health system, including adequate human resources and a continuous supply of commodities. As a result, our current guiding principle is \"high yield\" and \"high impact\" through targeted testing of most-at-risk popu-lations: patients with tuberculosis or sexually transmitted diseases, and pregnant women. Universal voluntary HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy provision might be e ective in reducing HIV transmission, but with the current health system constraints in many sub-Saharan African countries such as Ethiopia, it is really not feasible to practise it. We recommend \"high yield\" and \"high impact\" HIV testing with early initiation of antiretroviral therapy, and improved adherence and retention of patients in care and treatment.

Authors' reply We thank the many colleagues around the world who have commented on our theoretical paper, and are encouraged by the ongoing discussion about how best to use antiretroviral therapy for HIV prevention. These comments signal that more research is needed. The hypothetical approach that was modelled need not be interpreted as putting public health in competition with individual health. There is increas-ing evidence of individual bene t from earlier initiation of anti retro-viral therapy, and the opti mum time to start therapy remains uncertain. Only research can determine conclusi-vely whether the modelled approach would bene t individuals by reducing HIV transmission and HIV disease, or whether drug toxicity and other consid-erations would outweigh advantages. We agree that operational challenges in high burden, resource-constrained settings are formidable. The paper was a hypothetical exercise and further research is required to assess whether the studied approach has merit. We also agree that ethical and human rights issues need to be addressed, along with technical and nancial considerations, as the concept of antiretroviral therapy for HIV prevention is further developed. We stress that other prevention modalities would continue to have a role, including ethical partner noti cation, as appropriate. "}
