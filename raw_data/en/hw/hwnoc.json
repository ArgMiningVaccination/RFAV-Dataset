It is not a text -book, and information on other clinical sciences: pathophysiology, anatomy, pharmacology, biochemistry, genetics, clinical and information technology are availa ble from many other resources. There is often more than one clinical approach to the conditions included in this booklet; we describe a standardised way that is practiced at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. The diseases and conditions reflect th e epidemiology of paediatric critical illness in Victoria, but with just a few exceptions this list is common to most middle and high income settings. The rapid changes in medicine and health in this century are reflected in intensive care, so some of the information will be out of date in the next few years. However the basics of intensive care - the maintenance of airway, breathing, circulation, prevention of secondary brain injury, meticulous attention to clinical detail, prevention of hospital -acquired infections, minimizing antimicrobial resistance, quality improvement and good communication will always be key skills to learn and priorities on which to to focus. Since the first edition of this booklet in 2003 we now care for more children with chronic and complex underlying diseases; and for many children repeated ICU admissions or needing some ICU -technology at home are realities of life. It remains however that the minimal objective of treating children in ICU should be to restore them to the best po ssible level of health, which enables them to leave hospital and be at home with their families. Optimising function and quality of life are major outcomes in PICUs where mortality rates are now low. All who work in ICU need to focus on continuous quality improvement to avoid unnecessary complications, and to mitigate the effects of intensive care on development and psychological health. We hope this book will be useful to doctors and nurses working in paediatric intensive care in many countries. Please n ote: these guidelines may not apply to an individual patient or every circumstance of illness. Doctors and nurses should not regard them as universally applicable. Trevor Duke Editor 4th Edition THE GOLDEN RULES 1. The prime goal of intensive care is to preserve airway, breathing and circulation at all times 2. Identify high -risk child ren before they deteriorate ; be proactive rather than reactive in treatment 3. Wash your hands - always observe the 5 moments of hand hygiene 4. Be polite and helpful to referring staff from both RCH and other hospitals 5. All visiting medical teams must speak with the PICU consultant or senior registrar when seeing a patient in the ICU 6. In a child with suspected severe sepsis, admit immediately to ICU if any one or more of : Venous blood Lactate >3 mmol/L; Neutropenia (neutrophil count <1000 / not related to cancer chemotherapy) Large pleural effusion (e.g. near white out of hemithorax) Coagulopathy (INR> 1.6, APTT>60, Fib <1) Signs of shock persisting despite a total of 40ml/kg fluid 7. Admit to ICU: infants with bacterial meningitis; children with croup who needed more than 2 doses of adrenaline in the previous hour; children with acute leukaemia and a white cell count >300,000 8. If you order a pathogy test you have to follow up. All pathology results must be reviewed, acted -upon or handed on to the next registrar to follow -up 9. Do not order diagnostic tests at regular intervals (such as every day), but rather i n response to specific clinical questions 10. Do not transfuse red blood cells in hemodynamically stable, non-bleeding ICU patients with a haemoglobin concentration greater than 7 g/dL (Hb threshold in cardiac patients varies with lesion and age) 11. Do not deeply sedate mechanically ventilated patients without a specific indication and without daily attempts to lighten sedation 12. Do not continue life support for patients at high risk for death or severely impaired functional recovery without offering patients and th eir families the alternative of care focused entirely on comfort. 13. Do not continue antibiotics when clinical and laboratory signs of sepsis are absent or resolved and cultures are negative 14. Do not give oxygen for upper airway obstruction unless you have made the decision to intubate 2 15. Intubate for upper airway obstruction before cyanosis or exhaustion develops 16. Do not paralyse a child with upper airway obstruction when intubating 17. Take chest x -ray (and look at it) in all intubated admissions, and in all children intubated in the unit 18. Never paralyse a child without looking at the tidal volumes and adjusting the ventilator appropriately 19. Do not extubate after a severe hypoxic -ischaemic insult or suspected non -accidental brain injury without discussion with t he ICU consultant 20. Give at least 2 ampoules of antivenom before giving FFP or cryoprecipitate for coagulopathy after snakebite Cardiac 21. A child with a lactate > 4 mmol at 4 hours after cardiac surgery has a 45% risk of a major complication: maintain blood volume, Hb 120 -140, do not stop inotropes, optimise oxygen saturation, deep sedation & paralysis, correct arrhythmias, consider echo. Contact ICU consultant if t he lactate is higher at 8 hours. 22. Single ventricle (eg Norwood, pulmonary atresia plus Blalock): balance pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance (saturation 70 -85%). See protocol. 23. Oxygen delivery is usually best with dobutamine 5 -10 mcg/kg/min plus a va sodilator; ensure adequate coronary perfusion pressure (diastolic BP - CVP). 24. If you think that a cardiac surgical patient needs an echo, call the ICU consultant. 25. After a shunt (central, Blalock, Norwood), start heparin 10u/kg/hr immediately on return to I CU. Do not wait for coagulation test results. 26. Internal jugular and subclavian central lines, and surgically - placed lines are not to be inserted without ICU consultant approval , and should use ultrasound guidance . 27. Call the ICU consultant if you take more than 30min s to insert a femoral line. 28. Unless there is a contraindication, give heparin 10u/kg/hr to a maximum of 250 U/hour to all children with a central line (neck or femoral). 29. Never place an ulnar or radial artery catheter without first ensuring the pr esence of dual blood supply to hand and fingers by other arteries (by ascertaining the presence of ulnar and radial pulses, and ideally by ultrasound). 30. If digits show signs of ischaem ia associated with intra - arterial cannula, remove catheter immediately, c all Plastic Surgeon and ICU consultant, and haematologist with view to 3 heparin therapy. 31. No child should go to theatre on parenteral nutrition - change to equivalent glucose infusion, mg/kg/min. Administration 32. At least one registrar should stay in each Pod at all times, except in an emergency. 33. If you leave the unit, tell the nurse in charge , and hand over your patients to another registrar. 34. Inform the bedcard unit when a child is admitted to ICU, and on discharge. 35. For every patient, write a progress note at least twice a day, and when there is a change in status or an inva sive procedure is performed. If you admit a patient, complete EMR admission before you leave the unit. 36. Discharges. Carefully complete all the tasks listed on the ICU Discha rge Check List. Night registrars should write discharge summaries before the 8am handover. 37. If a child dies in ICU, the summary and medical certificate of death should be written by the ICU Registrar , and the ICU Consultant is responsible for a Coroner's su bmission . Complete the ICU Discharge Check List. 38. The AUM (nurse in charge o f a shift) has the right to ask an ICU registrar to ring the ICU consultant about a patient (and the AUM may phone the consultant if the registrar refuses). 4 ADMIN - FELLOWS The roles of the ICU Fellow include: Provide continuity of clin ical care Provide supervision and teaching to ICU registrars Assist and supervise ICU registrars in procedures Facilitate communication between ICU registrars and the director of ICU Supervise MET calls and review of PICU discharges. The ICU Fellow should attempt to provide contin uity of care, especially for long term or complicated patients. The Fellow is sometimes not allocated to individual patients, so that he or she is free to provide overall supervision and teaching to the registrars. Should ensure that each ICU registrar gets a lunch break, and covers the rooms if necessary. Supervises all new admissions and discusses the manag ement with the registrar - but lets the registrars do as much as possible themselves, and encourages them to formulate their own plan of management. Can take PETS calls during the day Ensure that the Boyle's machine has been checked daily . The Fellow may r espond to referrals from Emergency and Met calls during the day. Inform the consultant about PETS, Emergency, and M ET calls. Teaching is an important part of the Fellow's job. The Fellow should do a teaching round with the registrars and medicval students each day if there is time. The Fellow should keep the ICU consultant informed of new admissions and important developments at all times. 5 ADMIN - CONTACTING THE PICU CONSULTANT PURPOSE To ensure ICU consultants are notified of key events and information. The ICU consultant must be notified in the following circumstances: Patient deterioration Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrest or refractory significant arrhythmia Major bleeding requiring transfusion or activation of massive transfusion protocol VIS score doubled or adrenaline >0.1 or norad renaline to endotracheal intubation or extubation, if unplanned Unanticipated commencement of mechanical ventilation or NIV Marked increase in ventilation or NIV requirements including increase of 30% in FIO2 (e.g. increasing from a FIO2 30% to 60%) Upper airway obstruction persistent despite >2 of adrenaline, or hypoxic (SpO2<90%) Neurological: Refractory int racranial hypertension (notify Neurosurgeons as well) New focal neurological signs or marked deterioration in GCS Refractory seizures unresponsive to 2 doses of midazolam and loading with a long -active anticonvulsant agent Renal / Metabolic Before co mmencing CRRT Urine output < 0.5 ml/ kg/hour unresponsive to therapy for > 4 hours (unless on renal replacement therapy) Oliguria with hyperkalaemia or acidosis Hyperammonaemia: >150 micromol/L Procedural Prior to any major invasive procedure planne d in ICU Prior to any procedure in an ECMO patient If there is a complication of any procedure Prior to referral to an external unit e.g. Endocrinology, General Surgery, Neurosurgery PETS / PIPER Referral of any patient who fulfils the \"Go Now\" criteria Where any PETS trip is being delayed for any reason: lack of staffing / transport difficulty / bed availability 6 If on arrival the patient is sicker than was previously understood ICU workflow Unexpected death in ICU or discharge from ICU Any referral to ICU (whether accepted or refused) Excessive workload for ICU junior medical staff resulting in unsafe conditions or inability to complete tasks Significant disagreement or conflict with ICU nursing staff, external medical staff, patient or patient's family Adverse clinical event leading to a VHIMS (Victorian Health Incident Management System) report There should be a low threshold for notification. Even if you are able to manage the situation the consultant still needs to know that th ese significant events have occurred. 7 ANALGESIA AND SEDATION Children tolerate short -lived discomfort remarkably well if they are treated sensitively - they fall over and run into things almost daily. Narcotic analgesics and heavy sedation inhibit movemen t (needed to get rid of excess body water) and coughing, and prolong intubation and mechanical ventilation with substantial additional risk of morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, inadequate analgesia for severe or prolonged pain is cruel and harmfu l. Muscle relaxants do not prevent pain or awareness. Although ideally a PICU patient should be alert, cooperative and free of pain and anxiety, in practice, painful procedures and alarming surroundings often make life unpleasant. In particular, being para lysed but aware and unable to move, communicate or avoid noxious stimuli may not be painful but is highly unpleasant and represents a failure of care. Opiates, even in high dose, don't reliably prevent awareness or produce amnesia. An opioid plus a sedativ e relieves distress better than high opioid doses alone. Treat every child as if he or she is aware: speak frequently to the child (not loudly enough to prevent sleep); warn the child of procedures; explain alarms and sudden loud noises; limit bedside conv ersations with parents and other staff to what you would want the child to hear. In nonparalysed children use a scoring system (we use COMFORT B , see below ) and document the required sedation score range. It will reduce the amount of drug use and minimize risks of withdrawal and polypharmacy. BIS monitors can be used over the age of 2 years and titrated to the level of sedation required. BIS > 65 is associated with awareness during anaesthesia but not distress unless in pain and paralysed. Signs of pain if paralysed or apparently unaware Autonomic: sweating, dilated pupils, tachycardia, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension. Exclude other causes of autonomic response (hypercarbia, hypovolaemia, hypoglycaemia). Raised intracranial pressure. Non-drug means of managing pain and distress Remove obvious avoidable sources of pain, and minimise the distress caused by painful procedures: Wrap and cuddle neonates if able. Give oral sucrose 12.5% before painful procedures in neonates. This may be more effective if the baby is wrapped. Topical amethocaine or EMLA creams, vibratory or cooling devices are all effective at reducing pain during cannulae insertion. 8 Electronic devices with games or movies can also be very effective as distraction. Tell the child beforehand w hat is going to happen and why, even if the child is paralysed and appears too young or too unconscious to understand. Don't say, \"This won't hurt\" if it will. Say, eg, \"It will hurt a little, but only for a moment and then I'll get you a drink\". Use \"rewa rds\" after procedures: sip of fluid, dressings with a smiley face, TV, read the child a book. Discuss painful procedures and the reasons for them with the parents (if present) beforehand. Parents should stay with the child if they are likely to remain calm . Feed the child as soon as possible. Promote sleep and keep the child warm and comfortable; if possible, schedule procedures to allow rest periods and preserve the child's day -night cycle. Play the child's favourite music. Speak gently to the child and keep the surroundings as non - threatening as possible. Consider contacting the Play Therapists or Comfort Kids for ideas Drug management Our standard regimen uses infusions of morphine and clonidine (<12 months ), older ), often supplemented with paracetamol. Dexmedetomidine is available for short term (<72 hour use) Use the age appropriate Pain and Sedation algorithm (a specific algorithm available for ECLS patients usually requires larger initial dosing and rel oading with circuit changes) Paracetamol can greatly reduce the dose of narcotics needed, even with severe pain. Up to 90 mg/kg/day can be used for a maximum of 2 -3 days. Similarly tramadol 1 -2 mg/kg 6 hrly and NSAID's such as ibuprofen 5 -10 mg/kg 8 hrly ( if feeding or on anti -ulcer prophylaxis, normal renal function, not bleeding) should be used. Parecoxib 1 mg/kg daily can also be used intravenously. When converting to oral opiates chart oxycodone rather than codeine . Reduce morphine and midazolam well before you plan to wean the child from ventilation, especially if drug excretion is likely to be slow (eg newborns; poor liver or kidney function because of recent sepsis or low cardiac output; prolonged administration of the drug; large drug load because of ascites or oedema). Midazolam has a short duration of action after a single dose, but a prolonged duration of action after several doses, so it should be stopped well before weaning from ventilation . It is associated with increased rates of delirium. 9 Consider using midazolam (0.1 -0.2 mg/kg IV bolus) for procedures requiring brief sedation - beware myocardial and respiratory depression. If analgesia and sedation are required, consider ketamine. It may be necessary to give multiple doses of morphine (100mc g/kg) and midazolam (100mcg/kg) before giving maintenance infusions take 4 -5 half -lives to reach plateau concentrations. IV boluses of morphine and midazolam cause hypotension and myocardial depression. Consider reducing the doses (to 50 m cg/kg) or giving them more slowly (over 10 mins) or if necessary, by means of a more rapid infusion over an hour. In a critically unstable child, the best sedation is a compromise between ideal sedation and severe myocardial depression. Morphine has lower rates of tachyphylaxis and withdrawal than fentanyl, so use morphine as first line opoid infusion . For proven morphine sensitivity in a ventilated child, use fentanyl 2 mcg/kg IV bolus, then infuse 2 or hydromorphone afte r 5-7 is given as an IV bolus (1 -4 mcg/kg) for rapid onset with minimal CVS effects. Cardiac output may be reduced, as fentanyl suppresses endogenous catecholamine output. It often causes apnoea in unventilated patients. Larger doses given r apidly cause apnoea with chest wall rigidity unless a muscle relaxant is given first. Give fentanyl slowly in an unstable patient. Remifentanil can be used for renal and hepatic failure or severe pulmonary hypertension. Infusions aim for 0.05 - 0.2 mcg/kg /min. Boluses of 0.1 - 0.5 mcg/kg/min can be given but there is a very high risk of bradycardia and hypotension. Tachyphylaxis occurs. Hydromorphone (load 50mcg/kg slow IV over 1 hour 2mg max dose) Bolus <50kg: 5 - 10 mcg/kg >50kg: 0.1 -0.2mg, infusion 5 -40 mcg/kg/hr Dexmedetomindine is a newer (more specific) alpha1 agonist with a shorter half life than clonidine. It is useful for short term sedation and also provides analgesia. If stable give 1mcg/kg over 1 hour then commence an infusion at 0.3 -0.5 mcg/kg /hr (it can be increased upto 2mcg/kg /hr). Cease after 72 hours or transition to clonidine as associated with withdraw al if used longer than 96 hours. Propofol is available for short term (< 48 hours) use in those over 2 years of age. Small boluses of 0.5 -1 mg/kg are effective for short term sedation and infusions should be limited to 4 mg/kg/hr. It should be avoided in mitochondrial diseases, malnourished and unexplained lactic acidosis. TCI (target controlled infusions) can be used aiming for plasma (or effect site concentrations) of 1 - 4 mcg/ml titrated to level 10 of sedation required (or BIS if available) Patient -controlled analgesia (PCA) Used if the child can understand the concept of pr essing a button to self -administer pain relief when required. Consider its use in intelligent children > 6 years old, and in most children > 8 years. Contact the Children's Pain Management Service (CPMS) for advice before use, document a referral and a PON V (post - operative nausea and vomiting protocol) add MR number . Usual regimen: morphine 0.5 mg/kg (up to 50kg use 50 mg) in 50 ml 0.9% saline; bolus dose 2 ml (= 20 mcg/kg morphine); lockout interval 5 minutes; background infusion (optional - rarely re quired and increase side effects) 0.5 ml/hour (= 5 mcg/kg/hr). Fentanyl or oxycodone PCA are alternatives refer to - CPMS. Fill in the PCA prescribing sheet especially the naloxone orders; observe carefully for respiratory depression, excessive sedation, n ausea or vomiting; monitor SpO 2; only the child may press the demand button. Adolescents may benefit from naloxone added to the PCA or prn if PONV, non -ventilated Usually need no sedation. If very agitate d or distressed, try -5 hourly, 0.1 -0.15 mg/kg 6 hourly prn. Try feeding, comfort and entertainment. If a painful wound or injury (se e below, trauma), use paracetamol, IV morphine infusion or PCA, or local anaesthesia. Paralysed children Morphine <3mo: 10 -30 mg/kg mins (Fentanyl 1 - 4 5 mins) before ET suction. Reassess analgesia and sedation needs frequently (hold relaxants if po ssible and perform COMFORT B). Need increased doses of sedation if using IRV or PRV ventilation patterns. For long -term paralysis, consider adding clonidine 0.5 -2 mcg/kg/hr or chlorpromazine 0.25 -0.5 mg/kg 6 -8H slow IV, rather than increasing doses of mor phine and midazolam. Intubated and ventilated but non -paralysed children 11 Consider using PCA (qv) in children > 6 years of age, depending on cognitive development. Morphine infusion: <3mo: 10 0.5 -2 mcg/kg/hr. Reassess sedation and analgesia needs frequently (COMFORT B) If using pressure -support ventilation or ASB, use a backup ventilator rate if there is any possibility that the doses of sedative or o piate will suppress breathing. Painful procedures Don't forget to optimize all developmentally appropriate non - pharmacologic measures (eg music and play therapy, Comfort Kids, parents) . Wrap and cuddle neonates if able. Give oral sucrose 12.5% before painful procedures in neonates. This may be more effective if the baby is wrapped. Topical amethocaine or EMLA creams, vibratory or cooling devices are all effective at reducing pain during insertion of peripheral IV or IA cannulae, even in a paralysed child. Conventional infusion rates of morphine don't usually abolish the acute pain of IV cannulation. Electronic devices with games or movies can also be very effective as distraction. For int ermittent painful procedures in a child who is comfortable the rest of the time, give IV boluses of fentanyl eg 1 -2 mcg/kg 5 minutes before the procedure. Ensure that local anaesthesia is given before isolated painful procedures (eg insertion of a central line or intercostal catheter, or bone marrow aspiration). Surgery in ICU For example, chest opening, cardiac catheter, balloon atrial septostomy, ECMO cannulation. Give full general anaesthesia sufficient to guarantee the absence of pain and awareness. A doctor must be continuously present with any anaesthetised patient. Use additional local anaesthesia with bupivacaine 0.5% \u00b1 adrenaline or ropivacaine 0.75% (max 0.5 ml/kg) if possible to prevent post -operative pain. Cardiac surgery In theatre, all chil dren have received large bolus doses of opiate; the effect will continue for several hours in ICU. Unless the child is to be weaned immediately from IPPV without any further doses of muscle relaxant, start morphine infusion (<3 mo 10 -30 mcg/kg/hr; >3mo 20 -40 mcg/kg/hr; >30kg 1 -12 5mg/hr). Add dexmedetomidine 0.3 -2 mcg/kg/min (omit loading dose if unstable) or use clonidine 0.5 -2 mcg/kg/min or midazolam 1 -2 mcg/kg/min (>30kg 1 -3m/hr) if paralysis is likely to last more than 4 hours. If planning immediate weanin g, infuse morphine 10 -20 mcg/kg/hr (use nothing, low dose propofol or dexmedetomidine); increase if child is in pain. Reduce or cease sedatives and reduce morphine 2 -4 hours before starting to wean from ventilation. Prolonged analgesia or sedation Rather than increasing the dose of -4(max) mcg/kg/min is useful for thoracotomy pain but tachyphylaxis develops quickly, use diazepam rather than midazolam. It will often be used in burns patients and doses will escalate during dressing changes - aim to de -escalate as soon as possible Patients on opiate infusions for >5 days are at risk of opi ate resistance and withdrawal (worse if also on midazolam). Use a WAT score (below) and document the weaning regimen with breakthrough prescriptions. Reduce the dose slowly and look for withdrawal symptoms (agitation, myoclonic jerks, sweating, fever, diar rhoea); increase the dose of morphine or add clonidine (or both). Convert to oral morphine or methadone and diazepam. Add clonidine if not already charted. Trauma and burns patients often have coexisting nerve injuries and neuropathic pain - amitr iptyline (especially at night) , gabapentin and or pregabolin may have a role . During transport (PETS) Do not sedate children unless they are ventilated, but ensure adequate analgesia for trauma victims (local blocks, paracetamol, and morphine 0.025 mg/kg boluses i f no head injury). 13 COMFORT B SCORE The Comfort B score indicates a child's level of pain and sedation. Step 1: stimulate the patient : touch to the torso or score following general nursing Step 2: watch for 5 minutes to assess how your patient responds to the stimul us and then assess them using the 6 categories. (If patient ventilated use the Respiratory Response category, if not ventilated use the Cry category) Step 3: Sum numbers in each category t o produce the overall Comfort B score Alertness 1. Deeply asleep 2. Lightly asleep 3. Drowsy 4. Fully awake and alert 5. Hyper alert Calmness/ Agitation 1. Calm 2. Slightly anxious 3. Anxious 4. Very anxious 5. Panicky Respiratory Response (Ventilated ) 1. No coughing/ no spontaneous ventilation 2. Minimal assistance from ventilator 3. Occasional cough, splint ing or resistance to the ventilator 4. Actively breathes against the ventilator or coughs regularly 5.Fights ventilator, cough, gag or choking Cry (N on-ventilated ) 1. Quiet breathing, no crying 2. Sobbing or gasping 3. Moaning 4. Crying 5. Screaming Physical Movement 1. No movement 2. Occasional, slight movement 3. Frequent, slight movements 4. Vigorous movement limited to extremities 5. Vigorous movement including torso and head Muscle Tone 1. Muscles totally relaxed, no muscle tone 2. Reduced musc le tone 3. Normal muscle tone 4. Increased muscle tone and flexion of fingers and toes 5. Extreme muscle rigidity and flexion of fingers and toes Facial Tension 1. Facial muscles totally relaxed 2.

Many children have the combination of food -related allergy or anaphylaxis and episodic or chronic asthma. The treatment is adrenaline. 1. Give oxygen by mask (or increase the FiO 2 on a ventilator) . 2. Give 0.01 ml/kg of adrenaline 1:1000 (=10mcg/kg) by deep intramuscular injection . Repeat after 5 minutes if the child is not improving. 3. If angioneurotic oedema or laryngeal oedema do not respond to parenteral and inhaled adrenaline, early endotracheal intubation is indicated. 4. Give 10 ml/kg boluses of 0.9% saline for hypotension. Large volumes may be needed - in this situation, insert a central venous line and monitor centra l venous pressure . 5. If the child still has clinical signs of anaphylaxis after 2 IM doses of adrenaline commence an adrenaline infusion. In an emergency with no central line: put 1mg in 1000ml and run at 5ml/kg/hour (0.08 mcg/kg/min). Principle is to start with a large dose then reduce when symptoms relieved, rather than a small dose and escalate. Severe tachycardia or systolic hypertension shoul d lead to dose reduction . 6. If hypotension persists despite adequate fluid therapy (as shown by CVP >10), obtain an echocardiogram and consider infusing noradrenaline as well as adrenaline . 7. If a child needs ongoing adrenaline infusion (sometimes needed for ingested allergens which continue to trigger mast cell activation for up to 24 hours), or if there is a need to reduce fluid volume infused because of risk of fluid overload, give adrenalin e via central line (0.15mg/kg in 50ml 1ml/hour = 0.05 mcg/kg/min) . 8. If there is severe bronchospasm, treat with nebulised adrenaline and ipratropium, IV adrenaline, IV aminoph ylline, and IV methylprednisolone. 9. Antihistamines and steroids are not given routinely. Anti - histamines often reduce severe pruritis, but may cause hypotension. 10. If a child has to be given a drug when they are known to be allergic to it, give methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg IV and low - dose adrenaline infusion (as above) before admin istration of the drug. 11. Emergency calls from theatre may be for refractory anaphylaxis - don't forget to remove potential triggers eg latex, chlohexidine. 18 12. Refractory anaphylaxis may require (0.02 -0.06 units/kg/hr), glucagon (40mcg/kg iv to max 1 mg) ; consider ECLS or cardiopulmonary bypass 13.

We have also seen several deaths from carbapenem -resistant enteric Gram negatives. The unregulated use of vancomycin provides selection pressure for vancomycin -resistant enterococcus (VRE), which can be deadly in the PICU. In deciding which an tibiotics to give consider: Probability of bacterial infection Fever or temperature instability, increasing IT ratio or procalcitonin (see procalcitonin section) Is infection likely to be community or hospital / PICU - acquired? Are there any signs of severe sepsis? Signs of severe sepsis: increased inotropic requirement with no other likely cause, worsening hypoxaemia associated with new CXR infiltrates. Likely pathogens For hospital see: http://ww2.rch.org.au/emplibrary/picu_intranet/Antibiotics_i n_the_PICU.pdf First line treatment of PICU acquired sepsis b e flucloxacillin and gentamicin (or benzylpenici llin, gentamicin and metronidazole for GI tract Hospital -acquired MRSA is uncommon in RCH PICU , although increasing community -acquired MRSA is being seen, e specially among high risk group s (indigenous, Pacific islanders, Indian sub-continent) . Although flucloxaci llin won't cover the majority of coagulase - negative Staphs, many of these isolates are contaminants, or the infection indolent, so changing -up to vancomycin if an MRS E is isolated will not result in adverse clinical outcomes Indications for vancomycin Signs of serious sepsis PLUS Known methicillin -resistant Staph aureus colonization or infection 22 High risk of methicillin resistant coagulase negative Staph aureus infection: such as a VP shunt or previous MRSE sepsis with CVC Risk factors f or community acquired MRSA (indigenous, Pacific islander origin, Indian sub -continent, plus signs of Staph infection) A short -term central line alone is NOT an absolute indication to use vancomycin rather than flucloxacillin as first -line treatment for PI CU acquired sepsis Indications for meropenen or amikacin Signs of serious sepsis PLUS Known colonisation or infection with Klebsiella spp or Enterobacter spp Recent gen cephalosporins, quinolones, pip/tazo, Timentin, carbapenems Approval is required by the RCH Drug Usage Committee (DUC) STOPPING ANTIBIOTICS or SCALING DOWN ANTIBIOTICS Before antibiotics are started cultures (blood, urine +/ - BAL) should be taken. Antibiotics should be ceased after 48 -72 hours if cultures are negative , and procalcitonin is low . If it is not appropriate to cease antibiotics (because of a high probability of bacterial infection or signs of severe sepsis) antibiotic therapy ca n be scaled down when 48 hour cultures are negative. Appropriate antibiotics to scale down to depend on the clinical context, but include benzypenicillin and gentamicin for culture -negative severe pneumonia or sepsis in the PICU. When scaling down antibi otics, the RCH Clinical Practice Guidelines can be followed for the treatment of focal infections. Other considerations Give a single dose of cephazolin 50 mg/kg just before any cardiac surgical proedure. Do not give prop hylactic antibiotics after the pro cedure . After 48 - 72hr of antibiotics, the patient has resistant flora; infection occurs at the same rate but with resistant bacteria. Do not give antibiotics just because an organism has been isolated from an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube aspirate (colonisation is to be expected). Do a BAL. Always give oral or NG nystatin when giving antibiotics. All children who have chronic lympopaenia, congenital or acquired T -cell immunodeficiency, or are on chronic immunosuppressive drugs, including corticosteroids and cancer 23 chemotherapy, should be on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis three days per week. \"The Sanf ord Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy\" is a useful reference.

Linezolid Streptomycin +/ - tetracycline. 27 ASTHMA These guidelines are for severe asthma in ICU. Determine the need for ICU admission by the patient's clini cal state and the response to treatment, not by the blood gases. Consider diagnoses other than asthma, especially in infants with poorly responsive respiratory distress. High doses o f salbutamol may be toxic if the child does not have small airways obstruction - consider this possibility if the child has minimal wheeze and develops marked tachy cardia, tachypnoea, hypokalaemia and lactic acidosis. Take a chest x -ray. Antibiotics ar e very rarely required. Inform the ICU consultant about any ventila ted asthmatic, or any child with asthma who is likely to need ventilation soon. Management 1. Oxygen. Removal of hypoxic drive is not a threat in children, and death i s caused by hypoxia. Therefore give high concentrations of oxygen - if on a nebuliser, use 100% oxygen. 2. Nebulised salbutamol . Outside ICU, salbutamol is best given via a spacer device. In patients sick enough to need ICU, use 100% oxygen to drive a wet nebuliser (eg Hudson Micro Mist 1880). Use 0.5% undiluted respirator solut ion (5 mg/ml), not the 2.5 ml nebules (which are only 1 mg/ml or 2 mg/ml). Put 6 ml of 0.5% solution in the nebuliser (and refill when about 2 ml remain): <2 years: oxygen at 10 -12 L/min (tape connections) >=2 years: oxygen at 8 L/min If salbutamol, u se adrenaline 1/1000 (0.1%). Note: The respirator solution can be added via a 3 -way tap on the end of an NG tube passed into the nebuliser through a hole in the side of the face -mask. 3. Ipratropium (Atrovent) 250 mcg/ml. 1 ml added to salbutamol in nebuliser every 20 min for 3 doses, then every 4 hours. 4. Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/dose 6H IV for 24 hours, then 12H for 24 hours, then daily. 5. Aminophylline . If not on any theo phylline product, give a loading dose of 10 mg/kg IV over 1 hour, and then a continuous infusion (see Drug Doses booklet). Use separate IV lines for aminophylline and salbutamol. Measure theophylline concentration after 12 hours and then daily (target 60 -110 mmol/L). 6. Magnesium sulphate 50%. 0.1 ml/kg (50 mg/kg) over 20 28 min, then 0.06 ml/kg/hr (30 mg/kg/hr) to keep serum Mg 1.5 - 2.5 mmol/L. 7. Severe ast hma and anaphylaxis is increasingly common and causes deaths. If the child with acute asthma has a history of food -related allergy or anaphylaxis , or has any signs of an allergic reaction (such as urticarial, hypotension, facial swelling) then adrenaline should be given. Give 0.01 ml/kg of adrenaline 1:1000 (=10mcg/kg) by deep intra muscular injection . Repeat after 5 minutes if inadequate response. If still symptoms after 2 doses of IM adrenaline commence adrenaline infusion (see analphylaxis section for dilution and administration peripherally). 8. IV salbutam ol. Give in addition to nebulised salbutamol. Give 5 mcg/kg/min for 1 hour, then 1 mcg/kg/min . Check for hypokalaemia and lactic acidosis at least 6 hourly. 9. Some children with mild asthma develop severe lactic acidosis (often with hyperglycaemia) when the y are given large doses of sympathomimetics. The acidosis causes hype rventilation, which may be misinterpred as asthma, so even more sympathomimetics are given. If a child has severe acidosis with minimal hyperinflation, reduce the dose of sympthomimetics. 10. Give 10 ml/kg boluses of 0.9% saline if for dextrose in mmol/L 2 ml/kg/hr (1 -9 yr), and 1.5 ml/kg/hr (10 -16 yr). Monitor blood glucose 6 hourly. 11. Do not sedate an unintubated child with asthma. 12. Positive pressure can be helpful in asthma, but increase s the risk of pneumothorax. High flow nasal prong oxygen therapy or CPAP may help some patients, but should not interrupt adequate therapy with beta -2 agonists (inhaled or IV) and other therapy. Indications for intubation are severe hypoxaemia and/or clinical signs of exhaustion from severe respiratory distress, despite 100% high flow oxygen by mask and adequate bronchodilator therapy, +/ - after a trial of high flow / C PAP. 13. If intubation is required, induce with ketamine . Ventilate a child aged 1 -9 yr at 16 -20 breaths/min, IT 0.8 sec, PEEP 7, use pressure controlled ventil ation - observe chest movement carefully, aim for a pCO 2 of 60 -100 mmHg with pH 7.10 - 7.20. Sedate with ketamine 10 -20 mcg/kg/min; try to stop vecuromium by 12 hours or as soon as possible because of the risk of myopathy . Cisatracurium ma y be associated with less myopathy . 14. Induction and intubation may be associated with significant 29 haemodynamic instability. Give 10ml/kg volume prior to induction and ensure that adrenaline is available. A common reason for decompensation after intubation is breath stacking with increased intrathoracic pressure and reduced venous return. Disconnection from ventilation to allow expiration may be helpful 15. Intrinsic PEEP and gas trapping can be estimated by stopping the ventilator at end expiration for 15 sec; in trinsic PEEP = pressure at end of a normal breath minus pressure at end of prolonged expiration, a nd trapped gas volume = tidal volume to end -expiration minus normal tidal volume. If you suspect gas trap ping, (a) increase expiratory time, (b) pre-oxygen ate then dis connect the ventilator tubing for 30 - 60 sec hourly - or more often if you suspect severe gas trapping (listen near the end of the ETT for exhaled gas flow). 16. Monitor CVP. If there is hypotension despite a normal or high CVP, consider obtaining a CXR (air leak) and an echo . Left atrial size and IVC distensibility with changes on passive leg raise may be used to assess volume responsiveness 17. Avoid rapid cessation of treatment just before discharge to the ward. Salbutamol and ipratropium inhalation s can be continued in the ward, with daily prednisolone and aminophylline given IV over 1 hr via a burette every 6 hours. 30 BRONCHIOLITIS The first episode of wheezing, apnoea or respiratory dis tress associated with an upper respiratory tract infection in a child less than 24 months of age. Nurse in a separate area of ICU if possible. 1. Handle the child as little as possible. 2. Neutral thermal environment. Small infants should be fully clothed (with a hat) in a warm room. 3. Give oxygen if SpO 2 is <9 2%, give oxygen by nasal prongs. If respiratory distress is severe enough to warrant ICU admission, give Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen therapy 4. Feed with a NG tube unless severe respiratory distress or hypoxaemia despite oxyg en or High Flow Nasal Cannula. IV fluids 1 ml/kg/hr for 24 -48 hours, monitor blood glucose . An IA line is not required routinely unless the child is ventilated. 5. A chest x -ray should be taken on admission, but is not required every day unless there is deter ioration. 6. If the child is becoming exhausted on HFNC oxygen therapy , give nasopharyngeal CPAP (NCPAP) of 6 -12 cm H 2O. 7. If the child is becoming tired on NCPAP, consider endotracheal intubation and mechan ical ventilation using pressure support. When a child is ventilated, a pCO 2 of 60 -80 mmHg (pH 7.10 -7.20) is often appropriate. See the advice about ventilation in the entry on Asthma. 8. Antibiotics should not be given routinely . If the neutrophil I/T ratio is high or PCT and give penici llin (or flucloxacillin) gentamicin. Check blood glucose in an infant who presents with apnoea . If there is apnoea, fever and PCT >2ng/ml, consider lumbar puncture when safe to do so. 9. A trial of nebulised adrenaline and dexamethasone may be useful for children with severe bronchiolitis. Give adrenaline 1% 0.05ml/kg diluted to 6ml 8 hourly. Adren aline may worsen V:Q matching and causes tachycardia, so monitor closely and stop if worsens 31 BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE Equipment Combicath, simple dressing set, 10ml syringe, sterile saline, drawing -up needle, sterile scissors, mask, gloves, hat. Measure the distance from the patient's xiphist ernum to the tragus (ear), then to the outer end of the endotracheal tube. If the total distance is less than 35cm, use a Combicath 58223.19 (short), and if it is 35cm or more use a Combicath 58229.19 (long). Procedure 1. Use a sterile technique (scrub, g loves, mask, hat). 2. Pre-oxygenate the patient. 3. Insert the Combicath through a valved swivel connector (Bodai) and into the endotracheal tube until it is gently wedged. 4. While keeping the white outer protective sheath wedged, pull back the clear inner cannula 0.5 cm so you can remove the 5cm grooved tube that is between the end of the white protective sheath and the end of the clear inner cannula. 5. Push the inner cannula back in so it is gently wedged in the airway, and hold it wedged while pull ing the white protective sheath out about 5cm (until it meets the Luer fitting on the end of the inner cannula). 6. While keeping the inner cannula gently wedged, inject 1ml/kg (maximum 10ml) of sterile saline over 5 seconds, and then aspirate gently for 1 0 seconds using the 10ml syringe. 7. Stop aspirating. To avoid contamination with tracheal secretions, ONLY ASPIRATE WHILE THE INNER CATHETER IS WEDGED. 8. After you have stopped aspirating, hold the outer protective sheath still and pull the inner cannula back about 5cm until you can see the end of the metal tube that is inside the inner cannula. 9. Pull out the whole Combicath (protective sheath and inner cannula). 10. Wipe the end of the protective sheath with a sterile swab, then cut off the distal 1cm of the protective sheath with sterile scissors. 11. Push the Luer fitting of the inner cannula back into the Luer fitting of the outer protective sheath so that the end of the inner cannula that was inside the patient is poking out of the protective sheath . 12. Inject 1ml of sterile saline through the inner cannula into a sterile sampling bottle. 13. Label the bottle and send it for a Gram stain, culture , viral PCR, and other tests as indicated (fungal wet -prep and MTB/Rif if TB suspected) . 33 BURNS Many patients with severe burns are managed in the burns unit - the risk of infecti on is high in ICU. Children with airway burns should be admitted to ICU (stridor, hoarseness, black sputum, facial swelling). Airway and oro -facial burns often need early intubation even if the airway is not yet compromised - always discuss this with the ICU consultant. Care fully document what is seen at laryngoscopy including presence of soot and colour changes. Get an ophthalmology consult early for facial burns. Adequate analgesia is very important. Use morphine 0.2 mg/kg IM, or 0.1 mg/kg boluses IV titrated to effect - then an IV infusion. Insert an IV (preferably through normal skin). Take b lood for FBE, electrolytes, blood group and hold. After burns in an enclosed space, measure carboxyhaemoglobin and thio cyanate (1ml blood in gel tube). If carbon monoxide >10% on admission, or if decreased level of consciousness, low blood pressure, or high blood lactate , treat as CO and cyanide (CN) poisoning (the CN result will come back too late to guide initial treatment). Discuss hyperbaric oxygen treatment (at the Alfred) with the ICU consultant - it may not be beneficial , and the risk of transporting the child is very great, especially <12 months of age. If there are circumferential burns of the neck, trunk, limbs or digits, es charotomy should be discussed with the burns surgeon urgently . Escharotomy can be done in theatre or on the ICU if urgently required. Blood transfusion is rarely required. Do not give prophyl actic antibiotics or steroids. Fluids The goal is to minimi ze oedema, with albumin 30 g/l, Na > 140 mmol/l, and urine output >1 ml/kg/hour. Initial resuscitation: treat shock with 10 ml/kg boluses of 0.9% saline. Give a total of 3 ml/kg per 1% area burnt for the first 24 hours from the time of the burn (half in the first 8hr, and the remainder over the next 16hr); use equal parts of 4% albumin and Hartmann's solution. Maintenance: Plasma -lyte 148 and 5% dextrose. 34 After the first 24 hours, give about 1.5 ml/kg/day per 1% area burnt, plus usual maintenance fluid. Adjust fluid intake according to urine output, CVP, pulse and BP. Do not use hypertonic saline for resuscitation. Start enteral (NG or NJ) feeds early. If there are signs of sepsis, antibiotic therapy should be based on cultures of skin biopsies, not surface swabs. Ask the surgeons to do biopsies when they are skin grafting or changing dressings. 35 CARDIAC DEFINITIONS CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS Aortic cross -clamp time .

After cardia c surgery , there is a high risk of arrest: 1. In infants <2yr with a high lactate (>5 mmol/l on ar rival in ICU, or >4 mmol/l after 4 hr) 2. In children with a low central venous O 2 saturation (<60% in a fully correc ted heart, or SaO 2-ScvO 2 gradient >35% in an uncorrected heart). Treat for low cardiac output syndrome . Notify cardiac surgeon and ICU consul tant if lactate still rising 4 hours post -op. After handover e xamine the patient fully. Pay particular attention to site and security of all hardware, adequacy of ventilation, cardiac examination. Set ventilator and alarms. Check for bleeding from chest drains. Take the first set of bloods on admission: ABG, ScvO 2, urea, creatinine, coags. Order and examine the initial CXR. Identify position of all hardware and look at lung fields and cardiac silhouette. Perform a 12 lead ECG (and an atrial ECG if rhythm is unclear). At the end of this process answer the following questions: - Is the child haemodynamically stable? - Is the cardiac output adequate? - Is the repair adequate? - Are any complications present? 39 GEN ERAL STRATEGIES IN EARLY POST -OP PERIOD Analgesia/sedation See full Analgesia and Sedation Guideline PICU Intranet Targeted sedation - usually Comfort B 10 -20.

BT shunt 10u/kg/hr, started No APTT Therapeutic anticoagulation for mechanical valve: APTT 60 - 80s. Aspirin - Aortopulmonary shunt, RV -PA conduit, Glenn/BCPC, valve repair, PA patching, homograft valves/conduits 3 - 5mg/kg/d ose daily when feeding. Stop heparin 6 hours later. Clopidogrel - 3.0mm aortopulmonary shunt, in addition to aspirin. Biochemistry Glucose: May be low (newborns - limited reserve), or high (stress response). No evidence for tight glycaemic control. Aim: 4-10mmol/L Replacement: 2ml/kg 10% dextrose bolus and increase amount of glucose being given in fluids. If frequent administration required, start 50% dextrose 0.3ml/kg/hr and titrate to effect. Dose being given (mg/kg/min) = (ml/hr x %dex)/(6xWt) Hyperg lycaemia: only treat if sustained (>6 hours in mid -teens) or if glucosuria and osmotic diuresis. Short -acting insulin 0.02 - 0.05u/kg/hr. Check glucose hourly IV for up to 4 hours. Check K+ 1-2hourly. Treatment of hyperK+ (>5.5 or rapidly rising): Remember acidosis produces hyperkalaemia. being emide 1mg/kg, IV NaHCO 3 8.4% 1 ml/kg IV over 30 minutes. Start PD. Other measures if still rising (rarely needed): resonium, dextrose/insulin, IV Ca gluc. Ca2+: often low hrs post 0.5ml/kg slow IV. If frequent replacement (?Di George), infuse at 0.1 -0.4ml/kg/hr. Mg2+: often low in first 24 hrs post CPB. >0.8mmol/L, 1 -1.2 if slow Beware hypotension. Albumin : often low immediately post CPB, usually returns to normal after 12 -24 hours. In infants, capillary leak and PD losses may prolong hypoalbuminaemia. Chest drains Underwater seal chest drains set at -10 to -20cmH 2O. Drains milked to encourage free drainage of intrathoracic fluid. Redivac drains have narrower, rigid tubing - difficult to milk. Watch for loss of vacuum. Acceptable losses: up to 5ml/kg for first 2 hours, <1ml/kg thereafter. Chest drain removal Remov e at surgeon's discretion - usually 4 days. Do not stop anticoagulation. Do not X -ray routinely post -removal. Echo Post-operative echo is not done routinely first night. Ask for the test if there is a specific question to answer (myocardial function, tamp onade, residual lesion etc). Echo if escalating treatment for low cardiac output. All clinically indicated echos are done by on - call cardiology fellow. Fluids Total fluids: Wt(kg) 3 5 7 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 ml/hr 5 7 10 14 17 21 25 28 32 40 45 50 Increase fluid as child recovers, up to full IV requirement when extubated (see Fluid and Electrolytes). carefully; small aliquots (5ml/kg) with observation 41 and potential to repeat, rather than large boluses. Many patients will have significant increase in filling pressures with small volumes. Fluid type: 0.9% NaCl if Transfusio n of blood products WCC and ITR: both rise following surgery, peaking 24 hours post-op. Coagulation: INR and APTT may be mildly deranged following CPB, nor malizing with time. If bleeding aim for normal APTT and INR (see Post -op bleeding). Inotropes/dilators/vasoconstrictors - Dobutamine 2.5 -7.5mcg/kg/min. First line to prevent/treat LCOS. - Adrenaline 0.02 -0.2mcg/kg/min. Additional inotrope if poor myocardial f unction - Noradrenaline 0.02 - 0.2mcg/kg/min. Pressor and nitroprusside 0.5 -3mcg/kg/min. Vasodilator if poor myocardial function and preserved blood pressure. - Milrinone 0.25 -0.75mcg/kg/min Long acting vasodilator if poor myocardial function and preserved blood pressure; LCOS if unacceptable 1ml/hr. - LA line enters heart through LA appendage or R upper pulmonary vein. Common atrial lines enter through R side of atrium. These lines have significant intrathoracic extracardiac course - risk of migration out of the heart with cardiac and lung movement. Do not access LA line for sampling. Neuromuscular blockade Only in severe pulmonary hypertension or haemodynamic instability. Intermittent vecuronium 0.1mg/kg. Always with deep sedation - Comfort B <10. Open sternum. Delayed sternal closure routine in some patients (post -Norwood) and common in other neonates fo llowing complex or problematic operations. Keep well sedated (Comfort - B 10-15) but not paralysed unless otherwise indicated. Do not give antibiotics rou tinely. Closure usually occurs in PICU post -op day 1 -2. 42 Pacing wires Temporary pacing wires are suture d onto the epicardium and exit skin through lower mediastinum. Conventions: blue=atrial, white=ventricular; if wires exit separately, R side=atrial, L side=ventricular. Do not touch uninsulated wires without gloves (microshock risk). Connect wires to pacemaker in all neonates and all patients with intraoperative arrhythmias or heart block. Peritoneal d ialysis (PD) catheter PD catheter placed routinely in all neonates and most infants. Catheter usually sits in RUQ and may be palpable. Catheter not on free drainage when admitted. Allow drainage if significant 3rd spacing and ascites. For PD use, see oliguria and PD (qv). PD catheter is removed by cardiac surgical fellow when no longer required. Removal of intracardiac lines and pacing wires Remove pacing wire s and intracardiac lines post -op day 4, regardless of presence or absence of chest drains. Cease heparin for 4 hours before removal, then check coag s only if therapeutic anticoagulation. Check echo afterwards. Routine blood tests. For initial tests, see a bove. ABG 2 ary with position of line]) 4 -6 hourly on the first night, mor e often if indicated. Albumin, magnesium, phosphate, creatinine and FBE daily for 2 days, then as indicated. Clotting studies and liver function tests are checked on the first post-op morning, and thereafter only if indicated. Transfusion of blood product s All cellular blood products to PICU are irradiated, except emergency O -ve blood and massive transf usion protocol. Packed red cells. Post-op transfusion targets depend on age, circulation and severity of illness. Try to avoid transfusion in patients who h ave had a clear CPB prime (>8kg) and no exposure to donor blood. Transfusions in ICU are associated with worse outcomes; a lower Hb is increasingly tolerated in a stable child. Suggested thresholds in stable child: 2V repair UniV repair Newborn 10 12 Infant 843 10 Child 7 8-10 Transfusion may be useful to increase oxygen delivery in low cardiac output states, and to reduce left -to-right shunting in infants. Pump blood. Heparinised blood collected from CPB circuit at end of bypass (Hb~100). Give within 6hr of return from theatre . Give 1mg of protamine for every 25 ml pump blood transfused (beware hypotension). Platelets. Platelet function compromised by CPB so transfuse platelets (10ml/kg) if bleeding. Tolerate platelets >50,000 if no bleeding. Ventilation Most children admitted following cardiac surgery have normal lungs. Use sufficient PEEP to avoid atelectasis and minimise PVR and ventilate to normocarbia. Positive pr essure ventilation improves cardiac output by reducing LV afterload. High pressure ventilation may increase RV afterload and may also reduce cardiac output by impairing venous return. Suitable initial ventilator settings <10kg pressure -limited; >10kg press ure or volume limited. Rate 20 -30 (<5yr), 15 -20 (5 -12yr), 12 -15 (>12yr); PIP 15 -25 cm H2O; PEEP 5cm H 2O; tidal volume 6 -8 ml/kg; trigger sensitivity <1L/minute; fresh gas flow 2 -3 L/kg/min (newborn), 1 -2 L/kg/min (child); FiO 2 0.5. Blood gas targets In most cases, PaCO 2 35-40mmHg and PaO 2 95-100 mmHg for FiO 2 <0.5 and In with a known R -to-L shunt (eg BT shunt, Nor wood), a PaO 2 of 95 -100 usually indicates excessive pulmonary blood flow. In most of these patients aim for PaO 2 35-40 mmHg and saturation 70 -80%. See notes on individual lesions for specific ventilation strategies (BTS, Norwood, Glenn, Fontan....) Difficulty with achieving target gas exchange requires investigation. Start with examination and CXR: ensure airway patent, ETT in normal position, adequate ventilation, no collapse, consolidation, effusions, pneumothorax, and abdominal distension. Consider inadequate pulmonary blood flow as a problem (pulmonary hypertension, mechanical obstructi on). 44 CARDIAC - POST -OPERATIVE PROBLEMS CARDIOVASCULAR Bleeding More than anticipated chest drain (qv) losses. Drainage bloody, not haemoserous. Blood and clot may accumulate in pleura factors; residual heparin (early post -op); hole in a blood vessel. Investigation and treatment: Priorities are aggressive treatment of coagulation abnormalities and early communication with surgeon. Check coags, ACT, FBC. Consider tamponade/pleural collection - CXR, echo if signs. Give platelets 10ml/kg if recently on aspirin. Recheck labs, aim to normalize. If ongoing bleeding and not returning to theatre consider tranexamic acid 100mg/kg over 1 hr, infusion at 10mg/kg/hr. Talk to surgeon aga in. Talk to haematologist about rFVII. Bradycardia Relative bradycardia common. Limits cardiac output. bradycardia, and treatment: check temperature, rhythm and conduction (ECG), drugs. Treat identified causes. If relative sinus bradycardia in early post -op period, pace to increase output (qv). Coronary ischaemia Any evidence of coronary ischaemia o n monitoring must be investigated further. These problems are usually mechanical in nature. Causes: manipulation of coronary arteries (ASO, Ross, Bentall), Ao V surgery, coronary compression (RV -PA conduit, PA band), coronary abnormalities. Investigation and treatmen t: obtain ECG and Troponin I (uninterpretable immediately after surgery, but important baseline). Ensure adequate coronary perfusion pressure. Inform ICU consultant and cardiac surgeon. May need urgent intervention (chest opening/ECMO/theatre/cath). High atrial pressures 45 Causes: awareness/pain, non Shone's), stenosis regurgitation, miss tamponade (qv) - high atrial pressures, tachycardia, hypotension with low pulse pressure. Ensure number is real (transducer), line in correct place (CXR, waveform), adequate sedation. Check waveform (canon waves in CHB, big a -wave in AV stenosis, big v -wave in AV regurg or tip at AV valve, damped if tip out of heart). Confirm rhythm (ECG). Echo if suspected tamponade, myocardial dysfunction or unexplained. Treat identified causes. Treat over - filling with diuretics, vasodilation or judici ous removal of blood. Hypertension General causes: awareness, pain, agitation, seizures, vasoconstriction (drugs, cold) Specific causes: after coarct repair (qv) or other LVOTO relief, BCPS (qv) or cardiac transplant (qv). Investigation and treatment: ensure adequate analgesia and sedation, exclude seizures. If hypertension persists use short - acting vasodilator (SNP 0.5 -3mcg/kg/min). Treat ongoing hypertension with short -acting beta blocker (esmolol 50 - 250mcg/kg/min) unless contraindication (bradycardi a, myocardial dysfunction, Convert hypovolaemia; treat per LCOS (qv). Use to treat excessive vasodilation bolus, -55mmHg, Hb 140 -160g/dl). Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) (see intranet protocol) Post-op oxygen delivery/consumption mismatch. 2 or 2 increased SaO problem. Investigations: clinical examination, review CXR, 12 lead (+/ - atrial) ECG, echo (function/residual lesion/tamponade). Recheck 46 zeroing of transducers, delivery of drugs, patency of lines. Treatment (see intranet protocol) Optimise preload with adequate filling. Avoid hypovolaemia. Reduce afterload if vasoconstricted. Add a vasodilator; half -life) initially. Optimise contractility: AV synchrony, appropriate heart rate, treat tachyarrhthmias. Increase inotrop y if poor function and no other cause. Minimise O 2 consumption with deep sedation. Consider paralysis. Avoid fever and consider active cooling (min 34 \u00b0C) to reduce oxygen consumption. Notify ICU consultant early. Notify cardiac surgeons if persistent problem or rapid deterioration. Refractory cases may require chest opening in ICU or ECMO. Pulmonary hypertension Pre-op risk factors: newborn, high pulm blood flow (big L -R shunt), pulmonary venous hypertension (L heart obstruction). CPB increases PVR & reac tivity. Episodic crises often with stimulation, ETT suction. Signs: rising PAP, falling LAP & BP, tachycardia, hypoxia. Treatment: Deep sedation, plus bolus sedation and paralysis for suction/cares. Consider regular neuromuscular blockade. Provide inotropy for RV. Start iNO (20ppm) if episodes are haemodynamically significant. Ensure adequate ventilation, aim for PaCO 2 30-40mmHg. Once stable, stop relaxants and bolus sedation. Then lighten sedation and wean ventilation. Reduce iNO over 12 hours to 2 ppm, th en give sildenafil 0.4 mg/kg once and increase FiO 2 by 0.2 before ceasing iNO. Consider regular sildenafil in ongoing pulmonary hypertension. Tachycardia An important sign that something is wrong. Causes: LCOS (qv), drugs (catecholamines), central (ECG), ventilation (CXR, ETT suction, ABG), glucose, Hb. Echo if suspicion of pulmonary hypertension, LCOS or tamponade. Treat identified cause. Tamponade Accumulation of pericardial or mediastinal fluid compresses the heart, progressively limiting venous return and cardiac chambe r size, reducing cardiac output. Signs: tachycardia, high atrial pressures, hypotension, low pulse pressure, poor perfusion, acidosis, oliguria. 47 Causes: accumulation of blood in the post -op period. Beware drainage that suddenly stops - drain blocked. Investi gation and treatment: look for clinical signs. Milk chest drains, make sure they are on suction. Check ABG and coags. Echo and CXR if time allows. Tamponade is a clinical diagnosis and if rapidly progressive is a true emergency: call the ICU consultant and cardiac surgeon. Fluid boluses temporarily improve cardiac output. Note that myocardial swelling may produce a tamponade -like picture, without significant collection of fluid or clot, particularly in neonates. Chest opening alone may be sufficient to impr ove cardiac output. RESPIRATORY Atelectasis Causes: thick palsy (qv). Investigation and treatment : check humidifier and tubing, hand - ventilate, suction with saline, Review PEEP, culture BAL, physiotherapy. Consider investigation for phrenic nerve palsy or tracheobronchomalacia (qv). Causes: thrombosis, pulm mmol/L (if fed) WBC >1000/L, veins for venous clot. Start enteral, low fat, MC T feed (Monogen). If high volume drain losses: change to TPN; Replace 50-75% of losses with 4% albumin; check albumin, protein, FBC, coags daily and immunoglobulins weekly. Give IVIG if low. Beware sepsis. Monitor for clot formation. Consider ligation of thoracic duct if persistent (>1 week) Signs: rising PaCO 2, tachycardia, sweating, desaturation, rising PAP, BP may rise (hyper carbia) or fall (impaired myocardial performance). Causes: pulmonary oedema, chest wall oedema, inadequate ventilation (leak in circuit, around ETT), abdominal distension. Investigation and treatment: examine chest and abdo, ABG, hand -ventilate , suction ETT; CXR, check ETT and ventilator circuit for leaks, check ventilator settings, alter ventilation as necessary, aspirate NG tube, drain ascites. 48 Hypoxaemia Investigation and treatment: Examine chest, ventilation, check sat probe. Verify with ABG. CXR. Ensure adequate ventilation and FiO 2. Treat identified causes. If cardiac cause suspected, check echo +/ - bubble study, discuss cath or CT angio with cardiology. Phrenic nerve palsy (paralysed hemidiaphragm) Causes: surgical injury to phrenic nerve. Usually unilateral. Investigation and treatment: Suspect if high hemidiaphragm on CXR or no upper abdominal protrusion with spontaneous inspiration. Screen during spontaneous breathing with image intensifier (or ultrasoun d). Indications for plication: newborn with failed extubation or not extubatable and no other cause; older child if 2 -3 failed extubation attempts. Tachypnoea Causes: pain, fever, sepsis, lung disease, pneumothorax/effusion, small lung volumes (CDH, Ebste in), pulmonary venous hypertension, cardiac failure, high pulm blood flow, metabolic acidosis, weakness, phrenic nerve palsy (qv). Investigation and treatment: examine (chest, abdomen, pupils, muscle tone and power, distress, ventilator synchrony); review HR, BP, toe temp, urine output; ABG; hand -ventilate & suction trachea; bolus sedation; FBC & ITR, procalcitonin, culture blood, urine, BAL and drain fluid. Increase venti lation (IMV rate or support pressure) if muscle weakness present. Screen diaphragm if suspicious. Echo if indicated. Treat identified causes. Tracheobronchomalacia Suspect if likely lesion (APVS), prolonged expiration, hyperinflation, on (APVS); intrinsic malacia. Investigation treatment: (spontaneously breathing, ETT high in the trachea, varying CPAP). Treat with high enough CPAP to stent airway. Slow (weeks) wean with sedation. Consider tracheostomy and CPAP. Ventilator dependence Inability to we an from ventilation often mul tifactorial in chronic patients in cardiac ICU. 49 Causes:central - excess sedation, delayed excretion of drugs, encephalopathy, hypercarbia; peripheral - neuromuscular weakness (residual relaxant drugs, ICU myopathy, steroids, deconditioning and muscle loss) ; airway - vocal cord palsy (qv), post-extubation (qv); residual lesion, cardiac failure. Investigation and t reatment: examine level of sedation, encephalopathy signs, respiratory drive, muscle strength. CT/MRI if abnormal neurology. Check leak around ETT, CXR, diaphragm movement (+/ - screening), respiratory pattern. Nutrional assessment, appropriate feeding. Ech o if evidence of residual lesions or myocardial dysfunction, may need further imaging and intervention. Treat identified causes. Young infants who have had a long complex stay may need a period of low level respiratory support while they grow and recover f rom surgery. Vocal cord palsy Causes: surgical damage to recurrent laryngeal nerve (usually L), 50 -60% of Ao arch repairs. Investigation and treatment: Suspect if arch surgery, hoarse voice, stridor, tachypnea, difficulty feeding. Diagnosis - flexible laryngscopy (ENT). Tube feed, refer to speech pathology. May require CPAP/HFNP. GI/GU Abdominal distension Causes: air PD especially if tense/tender abdo. Leave PD on free drainage. Increase ventilation if Oliguria and PD Causes: ADH secretion following (cross -clamp, haemolysis). Investigation and treatment: Oliguria is normal after surgery. Poor response to diuretics in first 12 hours. Do not use PD just to remove fluid in haemodynamically unstable infant early post -op. Start frusemide post -op day 1. PD used f or control of hyperkalaemia, active cooling, fluid removal if required, short - term renal support. Start hourly cycles (40 minute dwell), 10ml/kg, 1.5% dialysate. More concentrated solutions will remove more fluid. Unstable neonates may have haemodynamic 50 changes with filling and emptying. Renal US for prolonged (>3 days) renal dysfunction. Post -op, post LCOS renal failure almost always recovers, but occasionally takes weeks. Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) Risk factors: enteral feeding; newborn with single ventricle, left - sided obstruction or aortopulmonary shunt. Investigation and treatment: AXR, refer general surgery. Stop feeds. Antibiotics (benzyl penicillin, gentamicin, metronidazole) 7 days. Daily AXR. Watch for perforation. GENERAL Fever Causes: fever following cardiac surgery (\"post -pump fever\") now unusual. Think about other causes: SIRS, coincident infection (URTI), drug/transfusion reaction. Significant consequences in immediate post -op period: tachycardia, vasodilati on, increased VO 2. Fever s everal days after surgery is sepsis (qv) until proven otherwise. Investigation and management: get pre -op history, examine chest and haemodynamics. CXR, ETT secretions. Blood cultures, BAL (qv), other ITR and procalcitonin. Both ITR and proc alcitonin rise after cardiac surgery and peak on POD1. Treat excessive vasodilation with vasoconstrictors. Cool to normothermia in immediate post -op period. Treat sepsis (qv) if indicated. Seizures Seizures often difficult to ide ntify in early post -op per iod, with only hypertension, tachycardia and pupillary changes. Causes: cerebral hemorrhage, hypoxia, ischaemia, embolism gas. Investigation and treatment: examine tone, suppressibility of movements. Look for focal movements or deficits. Tr eat suspected seizures with IV midazolam bolus, recurrent seizures with levetiracetam or phenobarbitone. Check glucose and electrolytes. Perform CT brain urgently if decreased conscious state or abnormal neurological signs. Consider EEG if unsure of seizur e diagnosis. Sepsis High-risk group with multiple barrier breaches, poor nutrition, implanted foreign material, immunosuppression (therapeutic, chylothorax, Di George). Signs: Fever, vasodilation or decreased cardiac output, liguria, lactic acidosis, increased PAP. Rising procalcitonin, ITR, falling platelets. 51 Investigation and treatment. Examine chest, abdo, skin. Culture blood (CVC, art, percutaneous), urine, BAL, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid. Swab red/oozing wounds, drai n sites. Consider echo for endocarditis, LP, CT (mediastinal/abdo collection) Start antibiotics promptly (fluclox and gent initially for unknown organism), refine with further results. Stop after 48 hours if clinically resolved and cultures negative. Incre ase inotropic/ pressor support as indicated. Review cultures, FBC, ITR daily. Consider deep -seated infection (mediastinitis, endocarditis, bone, sinus) and fungal infection in longer stay patients on antibiotics. 52 CARDIA C - TACHY ARRHYTHMIAS Treat unstable patient with wide QRS tachycardia as VT - synchronised DC shock. Sinus tachycardia is more common than t achyarrhythmia. Investigation ECG: Do 12 lead ECG and compare to preop and immediately postop. Run limb lead rhythm strip with notation during diagnostic & therapeutic manoeuvres. Atrial ECG: Connect one atrial pacing wire to the RUL ECG electrode and the other atrial wire to the LUL electrode, then run a rhythm strip on the ECG machine. Lea d I is a bipolar atrial ECG, II & III are unipolar. This will help to identify the P wave during a tachycardia, and demonstrate the association between Ps and QRSs. Answer the following questions: Are the QRS complexes regular? Irregularity in 2nd degree heart block and atrial or ventricular ectopy. Are the QRS complexes wide? Wide QRS suggests VT. QRS may be widened post -op (RBBB post TOF repair) and occasionally during supraventricular tachycardias (rate -related aberrant conduction). Is there a v isible P wave every QRS complex? (sinus tachy, EAT, re -entry SVT, JET with retrograde conduction) If not, are Ps than QRSs, versa? (P>QRS - atrial flutter with block; P<QRS - JET, VT). Is the P wave morphology the same as previous ECGs? (abnormal in atrial flutter, EAT, retrograde conduction) ( JET) automatic tachycardia arising from AVN/His bundle. Narrow complex, AV dissociation (QRS>P) or retrograde conduction (P follows QRS). Self -limiting. General measures plus incremental cooling to min 34\u00b0C. Aim to slow JET, then pace above JET rate (AAI if AV conduction intact, DDD if not). Amiodarone if persistent and unstable - discuss with consultant. Back -up pacing (DDD, DVI, VVI) in case of heart block. ECMO atrial ta chycardia (EAT, AET ) automatic tachycardia arising from atrium remote to SA node. Narrow complex, AV synchrony, abnormal P morphology. 53 Treatment: general measures - very sensitive to catecholamines. -blocker or amiodarone may suppress automaticity - discuss with ICU and car diology consultant. Re-entrant SVT reentry circuit involving AV node and accessory pathway. Abrupt onset, narrow complex, AV synchrony, P follows QRS, abnormal P morphology, may h ave pre -excitation in sinus rhythm. General measures. Try to interrupt re -entry circuit: vagal manouevres (ice to face, gag, breath); rapid atrial pacing (qv); DC shock 0.5J/kg. Atrial flutter Re-entry circuit within atria, often 2:1 block at AV node. Narrow complex, P:QRS >2:1. Adenosine diagnostic - increases block, unmasks flutter waves. Interrupt circuit by rapid atrial pacing (qv) faster than atrial rate (may be >300). If unsuccessful, DC shock. Amiodarone helpful if recurrent. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) Wide complex, QRS>P, may see capture beats, often unstable. Think about Consid er amiodarone if resistant. Give Mg if torsades de pointes. Discuss with consultant. Heart block 1st degree common, 2nd uncommon. Set backup ventricular pacing in case of progression to complete AV block (CHB). CHB: ensure secure pacing (DDD, DVI, VVI); treat expectantly for 1 week before permanent pacemaker; watch V wire thresholds. If no wires, use isoprenaline, transcutaneous pads, transvenous pacing wire. TEMPORARY CARDIAC PACING Definitions Mode nomenclature. Chamber paced / chamber sensed / respons e to sensing AV delay. Interval between sensed or paced atrial stimulus and delivered ventricular stimulus. Maximum tracking rate. Maximum sensed atrial rate at which 1:1 ventricular pacing will occur (DDD). Post ventricular atrial refractory (PVAR P). Period following paced/sensed ventricular event when atrial sensing will not occur (DDD). 54 Sensitivity. Level of electrical signal from atria/ventricles that the pacemaker will sense. Threshold. Lowest output from the pacemaker that will consistently pa ce the atria/ventricles. Common uses Sinus bradycardia. AAI if intact AV conduction, DDD if AV block, DVI if poor atrial sensing, VVI if no atrial wires. JET (once slow enough). AAI if intact conduction, DDD or DVI if AV block. Complete heart block. DDD. VVI if poor atrial sensing. Rapid atrial pacing (RAP). To terminate reentrant SVT or A Flutter/IART. Put pacemaker in RAP mode. Pacemaker continues to deliver previous settings until 'Start' is pushed. Set RAP rate 10 -15% higher than tachycardia rate (at rial rate in flutter/IART). Press and hold 'Start' for 5 -10s, then release. AAI delivered at RAP rate. Pacemaker checking Underlying rhythm. Turn rate down below native rate. Sensitivity. Set rate below native rate. Start at lowest 'sense' setting and tur n up until pacemaker fails to sense (paces instead). Set sensitivity at half this level. Do not check ventricular sensitivity in CHB. Threshold. Set rate faster than native rate. Start at high output ('stim') setting, capturing appropriate chamber. Turn o utput down until loss of capture. Set at 2 -3 times this number. Pacing with a single ventricular wire. Use V wire in negative V terminal of pacemaker, insert skin wire or use atrial wire for positive terminal. VVI. Troubleshooting All sensing or pacing problems. Check electrical circuit: wires - connectors - leads - correct pacing terminals. Failure to sense (usually atrial). Reduce sensitivity. Reverse lead polarity. Failure to pace (no output). Hardware problem (pacemaker or circuit). Oversensing - increase sensitivity. Failure to capture. Increase output, increase pulse duration, reverse lead polarity. Pacing the diaphragm. Looks like hiccoughs at pacing rate. Often due to atrial output and position -dependant. Reduce output. Reverse polarity. Repositio n patient. 55 CARDIAC - BY LESION / OPERATION ALCAPA ANOMOLOUS ORIGIN OF LEF T CORONARY ARTERY FROM PULMONARY ARTERY LV dysfunction and ischaemia. MR almost always present. Repair once diagnosis made. LCA direct transfer to aorta or via intrapulmonary aortocoronary tunnel (Takeuchi). ARCAPA much less common. Important points Don't miss this diagnosis in infant presenting with heart failu re ?cardiomyopathy / myocarditis. Very sick pre -op. LV dysfunction and MR persist following repair. Usually return from theatre on ECMO/VAD. Specific post -op problems MR and LV dysfunction . with intoropy and dilation. Coronary Arrhythmias. may be source ectopy VT (qv). Usual course ECLS 2 -4 days. Inotrope and dilator to decannulate and through extubation (post -op day 4 -6). ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD) Extubated in theatre or soon after return to ICU (within 4 hours). Inotropes not usually necessary. Complications (arrhythmia, bleeding, effusion) very un common. Discharge to ward same day/next morning. AVSD ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT Pre-op problems Cardiac failure due to big L to R shunt, worse if severe AV valve regurgitation or L -sided obstruction. Pulmonary hypertension, worse if trisomy 21. T reat cardiac failure with diuretics, transfusion to Hb140 -160, positive pressure ventilation. Complete repair usually at 2 -4 months. Unblanced defe ct: common AV valve opens predominantly into one ventricle. May progress down single ventricle route, depending on degree of hypoplasia of non -dominant ventricle. Specific post -op problems JET (qv), or AV valve regurgitation). Usual Course 56 Sedation and observation for first 4 -6 hours, then wean. Aim to extubate following day in uncomplicated repair. Modify approach if any of above complications present. BIDIRECTIONAL CAVOPULMONARY SHUNT (BCPS/bidirectional Glenn) All SVC blood flows passively through pulmonary arteries, bypassing hear t. Usually no other source of pulmonary blood flow. Removes volume load from ventricle. Usually done at 3 months as part of single ventri cle pathway. Important points Intracardiac mixing - expect SpO 2 70-85%. Positive pressure ventilation increases intrat horacic pressure and decreases pulmonary blood flow. Use low mean airway pressure. PEEP 5 to avoid atelectasis. Specific post -op problems Cyanosis. Causes: i) pulmonary; -PA flow; v) low cardiac output (low SvO 2). Look for high SVC pressure and clinical signs of SVC obstruction. Ensu re no reason for high PVR (acidosis, hyperinflation, atelectasis, pneumothorax etc.). Echo to look at ventricular function, AV valve, anastomosis and PAs. Bubble study to identify SVC to atrial shunting, more formal imaging (catheter or to cl early define VV collaterals or BCPS obstruction. Ensure adequate, low pressure ventilation and inotropy for impaired ventricular function. Allow PaCO 2 to rise to 50 (increases cerebral and SVC blood flow, improves oxygenation), but avoid acidosis. Trial of iNO if persistent signs of increased SVC pressure. Systemic hypertension. Due to increased SVC pressure. Treat with vasodilator, many need ongoing ACE inhibition. Headache. Patients are often sore and irritable, again probably because of high SVC pressur e. Usual course Extubated first post -operative night, low inotrope requirement, remove IJ line post -op day 1. Start aspirin when feeding. FONTAN All systemic venous blood diverted to flow passively through lungs. Extracardiac conduit from IVC to undersi de of RPA.Final operation in single ventricle pathway, usually after a BCPC. Done at ~4years old. Important points 57 Transpulmonary gradient = SVC -atrial pressure. Fenestration between conduit and atrium is only point of mixing. R -L fenestration flow ensure s ventricular filling in the face of high PVR. SpO 2 usually 80s first night, rising to 90s over next few days. Positive pressure ventilation increases intrathoracic pressure and decreases pulmonary blood flow. Use low mean airway pressure. PEEP 5 to avoid atelectasis. Heparin 15u/kg/hr. Specific post -op problems Poor fontan flow. High venous pressures, big liver, increased chest drain losses, cyanosis. Causes: low cardiac output, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, conduit obstruction. Check ventilation, CXR. Bag & suction. Ensure no reason for high PVR (acidosis, hyperinflat ion, atelectasis, pneumothorax etc.). Echo to look at ventricular function, AV valve, Fontan conduit, fenestration and PAs. Treat respiratory causes and acidosis. Inotropes for ventricular dysfunction. iNO if persistent evidence of increased PVR. Cyanosis. Causes: pulmonary, poor fontan flow (see above); pulmonary AV malformations (develop in some patients with BCPC). Investigate as above. Check preop cath for evidence of pulmonary AVMs. Effusions. Ongoing high volume effusions may need partial replacement with intravenous 4% albumin. Chylothorax (qv) common. Usual course Most return to ICU on 0.1mcg/kg/min noradrenaline. Wean this off over first 12 hours, using filling to maintain BP in the face of peripheral vasodilation. Early extubation (within 4 hours). To ward post -op day 1. Transition to warfarin later. HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME (HLHS) Generally delivered locally and transferred early in good condition - breathing spontaneousl y, alprostadil, SpO 2 80s. Pre-op problems Balancing circulation. Systemic blood flow via PDA. Usually good systemic output at birth, but may change as PVR drops in first few days. If signs of excessive PBF an d inadequate systemic perfusion (tachycardia, tachypnea, high SpO 2, hypotension, lactaemia) require intubation, control of ventilation. Intubate with dobutamine, volume and senior assistance. Manage as per systemic to pulmonary shunt post -op problems (qv). Restrictive atrial septum. These babies are cyanotic, tachypnoeic and become rapidly unwell after birth. Require 58 intubation and ventilation, with discussion of urgent septectomy/Norwood or comfort care. Important points Surgery performed at 3 -7 days. Rout ine is Norwood with mBTS. Sano in wt<3kg. All return to ICU with an open sternum. Fragile circulation, sensitive to small changes in initial post -op period. Aim for SpO 2 70-85%. Manage as per mBTS (qv), with tendency for LCOS (qv). Specific post -op problem s LCOS (qv). Common post -op problem. Likely to need increase in inotropy over first night. Echo if concerned (RV function, AV valve regurgitation). Balancing circulation. Treat pulmonary overcirculation as per systemic to pulmonary shunt post -op problems ( qv). Desaturation. Causes: i) pulmonary, ii) inadequate shunt flow - as per systemic to pulmonary shunt post -op problems (qv), iii) restrictive shunt (3.0 or wrapped 3.5). Ischaemia. Watch for any evidence of coronary ischaemia, especially if aortic atresi a with tiny ascending aorta - ECG, troponin, echo and discussion of further imaging. Usual course Well sedated for first night. Chest closure post -op day 1 or 2, extubate 1 -2 days later. Discharge to ward post -op day 5 -7. Anticoagulation as per mBTS. Many patients have more complex and slower course thr ough ICU. 59 INTERRUPTED AORTIC ARCH (IAA) Complete interruption of arch, always with VSD. Duct -dependant systemic perfusion. Neonatal repair. Strong association with 22q11 microdeletion. Important points Often shocked at presentation. Big, unrestrictive VSD - SpO 2 similar pre & post ductus. Specific post -op problems Pulmonary hypertension (qv). Arrhythmia: JET (qv), CHB (qv). Vocal cord palsy (qv). Left main bronchus compression. Hyperinflation/collapse o f L lung. Investigate with bronchogram and CT angiogram. May need prolonged respiratory wean or aortopexy. Usual course Targeted sedation and inotropy first night. Wean ventilation post - op day 1, extubate post -op day 2 -3. PULMONARY ARTERY BAND Fixed restriction to pulmonary blood fl ow (PBF). Usually i) in neonates with unrepairable L -R shunts, ii) to protect pulmonary circulation during a period of growth before further surgery, or iii) to prepare LV for switch in late presentation T GA. Important points Difficult to get tightness of band right. Usually loose initially, with relative tightening with growth. Can be quite unstable post -op, with acute increase in afterload to banded ventricle. Specific post -op problems Tight band. Poor v entricular function, ventricular arrhythmias/bradycardia, +/ - desaturation. Resuscitate, echo, call cardiac surgery. Loose band. High saturations, with ongoing high PBF. Aim to increase PVR (FiO 2 0.21, PEEP 10, PaCO 2 50, Hb 140 -160). Slow wean of respiratory support. Pulmonary hypertension (qv). Often have had high PBF pre -op, susceptible to sudden increase in PVR postop. Band placement. Injury to MPA or pulmonary valve. Ischaemia suggests compression of a coronary ar tery. Usual course Well sedated for first night with additional sedation for suction. Weaning first post -op day, extubation 24 -48 hours later. Loose band with high PBF needs slow wean of respiratory support. 60 PULMONARY ATRESIA , IVS (PA, IVS) Very variable anatomy, with degrees of RV hypoplasia, tric uspid valve dysplasia and coronary abnormalities. Neonatal surgical priorities are to secure PBF, either by valvotomy, mBTS or both, and to maximise potential for growth of RV. Ulitimate repair may be uni/biventricular or mixed, depending on RV & tri cuspid anatomy. Important points Duct-dependant PBF. Thick, hypertensive, non -compliant RV. Fistulous connections develop between RV and coronary circulation, creating potential for coronary ci rculation that is dependant on high RV pressure. Specific post -op problems Depends on surgery Cyanosis. Exclude other causes, but may be poor PBF. Minimize PVR - ventilation and iNO as per pulmonary hypertension (qv). Avoid vasodilators. May need mBTS if not already done. Coronary ischaemia, if RVOT opened with RV dependant coronary circulation. ECG, echo, troponin. Give volume, increase SVR (noradrenaline), call cardiac surgery. Usual course Again, very variable, depending on course taken. Some infants may spend considerable periods cyanotic in ICU, waiting for forward flow through RV to increase. 61 SYSTEMIC TO PULMONARY SHUNT (mBTS, central shunt) Means of securing pulmonary blood flow in neonatal period (R- sided obstruction or single ventricle). Flow dependant on i) fixed resistance through goretex shunt (proportio nal to length and inversely proportional to 4th power of diameter of shunt), ii) driving pressure (BP) and iii) downstream pressure (PAP). Important points Complete intracardiac mixing - expect SpO2 70 -85%. Listen to the shunt murmur with the stethoscope bell at open end of ET tube or over ipsilateral 2nd intercostal space. Start heparin 10u/kg/hr immediately on admission. Ensure adequate sedat ion, including bolus for suction etc. Continue dobutamine. Wean alprostadil over first post -operative night. Specific post -op problems Desaturation. Can be pulmonary (examine, bag & suction, CXR) or due to poor shunt flow (blocked shunt or pulmonary hypert ension), Abrupt desaturation may be shunt blockage. Give volume, increase systemic blood pressure with inotrope or vasoconstrictor. Examine for change in murmur, urgent echo. If profound or persistent call cardiac surgeons (cardiac callout) and give 50 -100u/kg heparin. Consider a trial of iNO if unrestricted pre-op pulmonary blood flow. Excess shunt flow. Tachycardia, high SpO 2, low diastolic BP, lactaemia, cardiac failure. Excessive pulmonary blood flow at the expense of systemic perfusion and increased my ocardial work. Increase PEEP to 10, decrease FiO 2 to 0.21, transfuse to Hb 140-160. Consider allowing CO 2 to rise to 50 (may need to paralyse). Discuss adding N 2 to further reduce FiO 2. Surgeons may reduce shunt size by 'wrapping' - constriction along the length of a goretex sleeve around outside of shunt. These children may spend a long time on positive pressure 'growing into' their shunt. Usual course Keep well sedated for first 12 hours, then wean. No need to paralyse unless unstable. Aim for extubation post-op day 1 -2. Start aspirin when feeding, add clopidogrel if 3.0mm shunt. 62 TAPVD TOTAL ANOMO LOUS PULMONARY VENOUS DRAINAGE All pulmonary venous blood drains to R atrium . Connection between pulm veins and systemic venous system supra -, intra -, or infraca rdiac. R -L via PFO maintains LV output. Usually isolated, also occurs as part of complex defects. Important poin ts Severity of presentation in isolated TAPVD depends on degree of obstruction to PVs. Infracardiac almost always severely obstructed - cyanosis, hypotension, pulm hypertension - surgical emergency. Unobstructed - mild respiratory distress, SpO 2 80s- 90s. LA & LV often relatively small and non -compliant. Specific post -op problems Pulmonary hypertension (qv). Very common after repair of obstructed veins. Echo to check for residual obstruction. Non-compliant LA/LV. High LAP, very sensitive to volume administration. Small LV cavity - relative tachycardia. Chylothorax (qv). Common after repair of obstructed veins. Secondary pulmonary lymphangi ectasis. Consequnce of obstruction. Ongoing tachypnea, ventilator dependency and CXR changes. Rule out residual/re -obstruction. Very slow wean of respiratory support Usual course Depends on pre -op state/obstruction. Well, unobstructed - similar to repair o f L-R shunt. Sick, obstructed - deep sedation, manage pulmonary hypertension (qv), slow wean. TETRALOGY OF FALLOT (TOF) Physiology depends of shunt, acyanotic; obstruction points Symptomatic neonates get mBTS. Aim for complete repair after 3 months. Transatrial repair with attempt to preserve pulmonary valve. Systolic ventricular function usually good. Pre-op problems Hypercyanotic minute). Specific post -op problems Restrictive RV physiology. Diastolic RV dysfunction leads to continuous forw ard flow through RVOT in diastole. Confirm with 63 echo. Ensure RAP adequate (low -mid teens), AV synchrony, low ventilation pressures. Arrhythmia/heart block. Prone to JET (qv), CHB (qv). Usual course Systemic to pulmonary shunt (qv). repair. Targeted sedation. Low dose inotropes. Avoid Wean after Tetralogy with atretic pulmonary valve, small central PAs and variable, tortuous connections between systemic and pulmonary arterial circulations (MAPCAs). Important points RCH approach is early (few weeks) shunt from ascending aorta to central PA (to increase flow and promote growth of native PAs), often with further shunt procedures before complete repair (VSD closure, RV -PA conduit) at ~2 years. MAPCAs are not usually ligated or translocated onto PAs (unifocalisation). Specific post -op problems High PBF post central shunt. Unusual. L -R via MAP CAs and shunt. High SpO2, low BP. Treat as systemic to pulm flow CXR changes, potential infection. Restrictive RV physiology (qv) post complete r epair. Usual course As per systemic - pulmonary shunt (qv) or TOF repair (qv). ABSENT PULMONARY VALVE APVS) TOF variant with pulmonary valve leaflet agenesis, small valve annulus and extensive dilatation of PAs. Important points Course dictated by degree of dilation of pulmonary arterial tree and consequent bronchomalacia. RV dilation due to PR. Newborns requiring intubation and ventilation for widespread disease have poor prognosis. TOF repair often includes plication of PAs.64 TRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT ARTERIES (TGA) Usually isola ted lesion. Coronary anatomy important, but no contraindication to surgery. TGA with IVS often deeply cyan osed at birth. Arterial switch operation (ASO) within fir st 10 days, longer (weeks) if VSD. Late presentation of TGA IVS needs PA band to prepare LV for ASO. Important points Oxygenation depends on shunting (VSD septost omy (BAS) in PICU. BAS. Intubate and sedate for procedure. Inflammatory response often after BAS with hypotension and tachycardia - give volume, low dose vasoconstrictor/inotrope. Wean ven tilation and extubate when stable, try to cease alprostadil over next 1 -2 days. If cyanosis persists despite successful BAS, may need ECMO or immediate ASO. Specific post -op problems Coronary ischaemia (qv) Urgent investigation and discussion with cardiac exclude coronary problem. Usual course Targeted sedation, inotropy first night. Start weaning at 12 hours if stable. Wean off alpr ostadil and GTN by post -op day 1. Extubate post -op day 1 -2. TGA variants CONGENITALLY CORRECTED also subpulmonary stenosis, tricuspid valve abnormalities. Surgery to avoid progressive RV failure and TR. Senning (qv) + ASO (qv) = 'double switch'. Timing of surgery difficult and variable. Preparatory PA banding improves RV and tricuspid valve function and trains LV. Important points Associated defects dictate clinical course. CHB (qv) and reentrant SVT common (abnormal conduction pathway). Specific post -op problems Rhythm disturbance. CHB (qv), SVT(qv). Systemic or pulmonary venous obstruction. Watch atrial pressures, echo if concerned. LV dysfunction. Check post -op echo. Adjust inotropes and vasodilat ors accordingly. Usual course 65 If stable rhythm & LV coping with systemic circulation, wean overnight and extubate post -op day 1. TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Single arterial trunk to systemic and pulmonary circulations (always with VSD). May have arch hypoplasia/ interruption. 22q11 microdeletion common. Develop pulmonary overcirculation rapidly as PVR drops. Neonatal repair: PA removed from trunk, VSD closed, RV -PA conduit. Important points Big pre -op L-R shunt predisposes to pulmonary hypertension (qv) post -op. Coronary anomalies in ~50%. Truncal (neoaortic) valve may be abnormal and regurgitant. AV bundle position variable. Specific post -op problems LCOS (qv) common. Pulmonary hypertension (qv). Usual night (deeper if complications). Wean post-op day day 2 FECT (VSD) Small (particularly muscular) VSDs likely to close. Large or multiple VSDs create L -R shunt, heart failure and pulmonary vascular disease. Patch closure at 2 -6 months. PA band in multiple defects or premature infants. Important points Early (neonatal) presentation with heart failure - look for L sided obstruction. Transfusion to Hb 14 -16 will reduce L -R shunt in unoperated infant with failure. Specific post -op problems Pulmonary hypertension (qv) . Particularly in later repairs, large defects or Trisomy 21. Arrhythmia. JET (qv), CHB (qv) Respiratory problems. Some infants get clinical small airways disease/gas trapping after repair of big L -R shunt (poor compliance, prolonged expiration). Unresponsive to bronchodilators, settles with time and diuresis. Usual course Small VSD, older child. No inotropes, rapid wean and extubate. Large VSD, infant heart failure. Targeted sedation first night, dobutamine. Wean first post -operative day, extubate post -op day 1-2. 66 CARDIOMYOPATHY (Also see Myocarditis) (see intranet protocol) FBE, ESR, glucose, ABG, pyruvate, lactate, liver card). Urine for metabolic screen and GLC for organic acids. Urine / NPA / stool and 5ml clotted ECG, echo (2D and M), 24hr Holter, chest X- ray. Consult Metabolic Unit Management CPAP, BIPAP or mechanical ventilation. These reduce left ventricular wall tension and work of breathing. Cardiac echo and CVP should be used to ensure optimal intravascular volume. A high CVP may be needed in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Treat arrhythmias (consult a cardiologist). Consider biventricular QRS >=120ms. Rotation of milrinone and for arrhythmias. Inotropes usually cardiomyopathy, vasodilators (milrinone, levosimendan) are desirable, but introduce slowly (especially if there is hyopvolaemia). When stable, introduce captopril slowly. Give spironolactone. Frusemide may also be needed (avoid hypovolaemia). Beta-blocker s (Carvedilol) may be beneficial if tolerated. IV esmolol should be considered in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Beta -blockers are illogical if on catecholamines. Ensure normoglycaemia. Maximise nutrition; consider TPN, especially if signs of gut hypoperfusion. In ICU, give low-dose heparin and an antiplatelet drug. Long term anticoagulation is indicated for those with LVEF < 25%. Other treatments used occasionally include carnitine, coenzyme Q10, Selenium and L-arginine. Durable VAD support is indicated only for potential transplant candidates . Consider centrifugal VAD or peripheral ECMO for evolving end organ dysfunction if primary durable VAD insertion not possible. 67 CATHETERS - INTRAVASCULAR ARTERIAL LINES Never place an ulnar artery catheter in small children , prefer a radial or femoral . If you are going to insert a radial or ulnar artery catheter first confirm the presence of dual blood supply to hand and fingers by other arteries (by ascertaining t he presence of both ulnar and radial pulses, and ideally by ultrasound). Remove any arterial line if distal blanching or cyanosis occurs . Get urgent plastic surgery consult if distal ischaemia, and heparinise unless contra indicated. In a small infant, ra pid replacem ent of the fluid aspirated from the dead space of an arterial line can cause retro grade blood flow in the artery with a substantial risk of cerebral embolism. To sample from an arterial line: Remove cap and keep clean. If debris present, clea n tap with sterile swab stick and alcohol before starting. Aspirate dead space using a 2 ml syringe; at least 0.7 ml is neces sary to guarantee an undiluted specimen. Inspect line and aspirate any thrombi. Keep dead space syringe sterile. Collect samples as required. Do not take more blood than is absolutely essential for the tests required - this is particularly important in small babies. Replace dead space slowly via arterial line unless thrombi or debris visible in aspirate. The rate of replace ment shoul d not be greater than 1 ml in 10 seconds. Resistance to injection may be due to thombosis, spasm, or malposition or kinking of catheter; this should be investigated. Forced flushing is hazardous. Replacement of dead space results in heparinised solution throughout the extension and catheter. Further flushing is unnecessary. Clean tap with sterile swab stick and replace cap. CENTRAL VENOUS LINES Internal jugular and subclavian central lines must not be inserted without ICU Consultant approval. The use o f central li nes means a significant risk of compli cations, such as pneumothorax, haemothorax, haemoperi cardium, and IVC thrombosis, septicaemia and endocarditis, all of which have occurred in this Unit. Thromb osis and vessel perfor ation are more likely with double lumen than with single lumen catheters. Before inserting a central line, consider: 68 Does this child REALLY need a central line (would peripheral lines be safer and cheaper)? If TPN is the reason for the central line, could the child be fed enterally ? (it is safer and cheaper) If the child really needs a central line, would a safer, cheaper single lumen catheter with or without peripheral lines be better than a double lumen catheter? In an emergency, central veno us access can usually be achieved rapidly via the umbilical vein in babies up to 5 -7 days of age. While the anter ior fontanelle is open, it can be used to gain venous access in an emergency. Right internal jugular central line (inserted midway between mastoid and sternal notch): depth = (height in cm) / 10. Central lines (neck or femoral) carry a very high risk of thrombosis in children <5 kg - either avoid using a central line, or give heparin 10 u/kg/hr (unless contra indicated). Chec k the pressure trace on all central lines after insertion to check that they are venous rather than arterial. Put heparin 1u/ml in all monitoring lines (IA, CVC, RA, LA, PA). Do not put heparin in infusions with betalactams, dobutamine, erythromycin, mor or high volume infusions (>100 ml/kg/day), or in children with life - threatening bleeding. Put dobutamine in 0.9% saline. 1u/ml even if on warfarin or aspi rin. Heparin reduces the risk of thrombosis and bacteraemia with central lines. Do not change CVCs routinely to prevent infec tion Do not remove a CVC on the basis of fever alone UMBILICAL LINE S Catheter sizes: Weight UAC size Pay careful attention to thermoregulation. Sterile precautions. 2. Attach 3 -way taps and flush each catheter with saline. 3. Grasp the cord clamp with a pair of artery forceps, hand to your assistant, prep and drape the umbilicus and surr ounding skin while the umbilicus is held taut. Place and tie a sterile tie around the base of the cord. 4. Smoothly slice the cord (as you do this your assistant removes the clamp). 5. Identify vessels: the single UV sits at the 12 o'clock position, and has floppy walls. The two UAs have more muscular walls, and pout out of the cord's jelly. 6. Grasp the side of the cord with artery forceps to stabilise while you cannulate. 7. Dilate the umbilical artery with iris forceps: insert both tines of the forc eps into the artery, separate slightly as you withdraw. 8. Insert the UAC. Distance from skin = (weight in kg x 3) + 9cm. Check that it aspirates, flush slowly. 9. Insert the UVC. Distance from skin = (weight in kg x 1.5) + 6cm. Check that each lumen aspirates and flushes. 10. Suture the UVC, then the UAC. Use 'goalposts' to anchor them to skin. 11. Xray: the UAC should sit between T6 and T9. The UVC should sit at T9-T10. Tips: Insert the UVC second and suture it first. The UAC is unlikely to move once positioned, while the UVC moves easily. Tighten the umbilical tie if the stump is oozing; loosen if the catheters bounce at several centimetres. Remove it at the end of the procedure. A UVC which has fed to an intrahepatic position can be pulled back to a 'low' position, and used as short term (NOT CENTRAL) venous access. Patience is important: using force when attempting to insert umbilical lines can cr eate a false passage. Arterial. Tip above diaphragm, below the left subclavian artery; depth = 2cm more than distance from the tip of the shoulder to the umbilicus. PERIPHERAL INTRAVENOUS LINES 70 No more than 2 peripheral veins should be used before esca lating to a more experienced doctor . Never run a calcium infusion through a peripheral IV line (even for a short time). If TPN is run through a peripheral line, the risk of extravasation needs to be considered. NO child should ever go to theatre with TPN running through a peripheral line. If a child is on TPN prior to surgery , change to glucose infusion and ensure the equivalent mg/kg/min glucose infusion during surgery. If extravasation occurs, tell a doctor immediately . Call plastic surgeons to review urgently , and follow the extravasation guideline: http://www.rch.org.au/rchcpg/hospital_clinical_guideline_index/E xtravasation_Injury_Ma nagement/ This hyaluronidase irrigation within extravasation of parenteral nutrition and calcium chloride used for vaso constrictor extravasation . 71 CHEST DRAIN In children, chest drains should be inserted in the mid -axillary line (not the mid -clavicular line), in the 4th or 5th intercostal space. To drain a pneumothorax in a supine infant, the tip of the drain should be positioned anteriorly near the xiphisternum . Use a large drai n for blood or pus (eg 16 gauge for a 5 -10 kg child), and a smaller drain (preferably a 6F or 8F pigtail catheter ) - Empyema) . Lay the child supine with the arm above the head. Roll the child slightly away from you for a p neumothorax or slightly towards you for a collection of fluid. Infiltrate the skin and intercostal space with 1% lignocaine. For pigtail catheters, the technique is Seldinger: needle puncture through a small skin incision, then dilatation. For non -pigtail drains: make a small incision (just bigger than the chest drain) in the skin in the 4th or 5th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line. Use only blunt dissection of the intercostal space with a pair of artery forceps over the top of the rib (the neuro vascular bundle lies just below each rib). Hold the artery forceps about 2 cm from the tip (so that they cannot go i n too far), angle them towards the xiphi sternum, then push the forceps smartly through the pleura (you will feel a pop). Remove the forceps, and use them to hold the chest drain and push it into the pleural space angled towards the xiphisternum. Make sure that all the exit holes are inside the pleural space. To keep the tip of the tube anterior, tape the outside part of the tube to the skin behind the shoulder (so the tube runs under the arm). Seal the tube with a 3 -0 silk purse -string stitch, and tie the silk firmly to the tube. Put an adhesive clear dressing over the entry site (with some gauze if there is ooze from the wound). Take AP and lateral chest X -rays to check the position of the tube. Make sure that all the side holes are inside the pleural spac e. Good analgesia can often be achieved after chest trauma or surgery by infusion of 0.5% bupivacaine into the pleural space via a chest dra in: 0.5 ml/kg (max 20ml) 8 -12H, or 0.5 ml/kg stat and then 0.1 -0.25 ml/kg/hr (max 10 ml/hr). 72 COMA Coma is a symptom, not a diagnosis. Consider trauma (which may be non -accidental), meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral tumor , vascular accident, sodium epilepticus , tuberculom a and hyper tensive encephalopathy. See specific sections on these conditions. Maintain airway, breathing and circulation. Check blood pressure. Intubate early, especially in young children , and in children who have signs of acute raised intracranial pre ssure . Blood for glucose, culture, gas, electrolytes, creatinine, liver function tests, ammonia and cortisol. Urine for ward test (keton es), drug screen, and metabolic screen (and gas -liquid chromatography, if acidotic ). Do not do a lumbar puncture . Lumbar puncture can be done later when the child is conscious. Give cefotaxi me and acyclovir. Do a CT brain (to exclude haemorrhage or major stroke) or ideally MRI brain (if more likely encephalitis, ADEM, metabolic brain injury , early ischaemia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome secondary to hypertension ). Consider a trial of naloxone 0.1 mg/kg (max 2 mg) IV. If responds, give 0.01 mg/kg/hr (0.2 mcg/kg/min) IV. See sections on meningitis and encephalitis for further investig ations . Consider doing an EEG. 73 CONVULSIONS - STATUS EPILEPTICUS Most convulsions stop spontaneously. ICU admission will usually be required for patients who have not respon ded to midazolam (0.2mg/kg x 2) , or diazepam (0.2mg x 2) followed by a loading dose of a -line drug: levetiracetam (50mg/kg), pheno - min) or phenytoin (15-20 mg/kg IV over 60 min). It is important to stop seizures quickly in patients with acute brain injury (eg trauma or meningitis or acutely raised ICP ). Maintain airway, oxygenation and blood pressure at all times. 1. Give oxygen. Time seizures from its onset, monitor vital signs. Give benzodiazepine x 2 within first 5 -30 minutes, then if still seizing give loading of second -line drug by 30 -60 minutes. 2. Measure blood glucose. Consider blood gas, electrolytes, creatinine, liver function tests, full blood examination, drug screen, metabolic screen, ward test urine (ketones), blood culture, ammonia , CK. Do not do a lumbar puncture. 3. Respiratory depression caused by anticonvulsant therapy in an unintubated child is at least as dang erous as the convulsion. Children who have con vulsions despite the above treatment usually need to be intubated and ventilated. Pre-oxygenate, cricoid pres sure, , vecur onium 0.1 mg/kg IV, wait 2 minutes then intubate quickly. 4. If no IV access, use midaz olam 0.2 mg/kg IM or 0.5 mg/kg buccal, repeated as required. 5. Ensure adequate dose of one or 2 second -line drugs, then if still seizing give midazolam infusion 1 mcg/kg/min increasing if required (usually 2 -3 mcg/kg/min, range 1 -18 mcg/ kg/min). 6. Give pyridoxine 100 mg IV to a child <18 mo with recurrent or refractory seizures. Pyridoxine -dependent convulsions should respond in 10 -60 minutes. 7. Give cefotaxi me and acyclovir (do not do a lumbar puncture) , see encephaliti s. CT or MRI brain when the child is stable. 8. Maintain core temperature 36 -37oC. 9. Continuous EEG monitoring. 10. Thiopentone may be required if convul sions persist despite adequate loading of one or 2 second -line drugs (levetiracetam, phenobarb or p henytoin) Give thiopentone 1-2 mg/kg slow boluses until control achieved, and then 1 -5 mg/kg/hr. Monitor level of thiopentone needed with EEG (aim for burst 74 suppression - a level of anaesthe sia at which all seizure activity is usually controlled ) and monitor clinically. 11. Hypotension is a dangerous side effect of thio : maintain CVP 8 -12 cm, and echo early to check myocardial contractility ( dobutamine and noradren aline may be required). 12. If stat us continues despite thiopentone infusion (or recurs on withdrawl of and immunotherapy (steroids, IViG, plasma exchange in specific cases likely to have immune -mediated refrac tory seizures: FIRES CROUP High-pitched inspiratory stridor in a child with a hoarse voice and a harsh barking cough - usually with an upper respiratory tract infection. The differential diagnosis includes epiglottitis, foreign body, retropharyngeal or peritonsillar abscess, disease, the stridor is pr esent only when the child is agitated. In more severe disease, there is stridor at rest - but the loudness of the stridor is a poor guide to severity. When airway obstruction is severe, there is marked inspiratory indrawing of suprasternal, intercostal and subcostal soft tissue. In very severe diseas e, there is cyanosis and reduced air entry, with stridor that may be expiratory as well as inspiratory , and may be soft despite severe obstruction . Cyanosis or apnoea require intubation. 1. Give dexamethasone or IV , then prednisolone 1 mg/kg 8H IV, oral or NG. 2. Nurse the child fully clothed in a warm room (to avoid cold stress), and disturb as little as possible. 3. Give 1% adrenaline (L isomer) 0.05 ml/kg/dose diluted to 4 ml by inhalation, or 1/1000 0.5 ml/kg/dose (max 6 ml) by inhalation as required. Outside ICU, a doctor must be in attendance whenever adrenaline is given (not because it is dangerous, but because the need for it implies severe airway obstruction). 4. Any child giv en adrenaline must be reviewed by ICU and considered for admission by ICU. If a child is considered to need another dose of adrenaline within 3 hours of a previous dose, the child should be re viewed by ICU before the dose is given, and, if the dose is required , the child must be admitted to ICU. If ICU cannot review the child immediately, the adren aline should be given and the child should be admitted to ICU. 5. In ICU, adrenaline can be given repeatedly every hour or two if required to give the dexamethason e time to take effect. 6. Do not give oxygen unless a decision has been made to intubate (as oxygen may mask the signs of impending complete obstruction). Do not give steam or mist therapy. 7. The child should be intubated if he or she has severe obstruction, or has a poor response to inhaled adren aline. Do not wait until the child is exhausted or very severely obstructed. It is often helpful to sit the child on the mother's lap, and get her to hold the face -mask near the child's face with 4 L/min of 100% oxygen . Gradually introduce 76 sevoflurane, increasing to 6% over 1 -2 minutes. When the child goes to sleep, lie him or her down, place the mask firmly over the face (held by the middle, not the edge), pull the jaw for wards, and apply gentle positive pressure dur ing inspiration if required (beware of inflating the stomach). It will take 5 -10 minutes of 6% sevoflurane to achieve adequate anaesthesia in a child with severe croup. If possible, monitor end -tidal CO 2 and sevoflurane (aim for 4.5%). Apnoea and atheto id or epileptiform move ments may occur. Vasodilation may cause hypo tension if the child is even mildly dehyd rated - be prepared to insert an IV and give 10 -20 ml/kg of 0.9% saline quickly. If inhalational agents are not available, consider using ketamin e 5-10 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg IM. 8. Intubate the child with an oral endotracheal tube 0.5 -1.0 mm smaller than the usual diameter: for example, use a 3.0 mm or 3.5 mm tube in a child aged 12 -23 months. Most children will have copious yellow secretions when first intubated - this does not mean they have bacterial tracheitis. Instil 0.9% saline if necessary to enable all the secretions to be removed. Reduce the sevoflurane to 4.5%, and be careful to allow the child to breathe spontaneously (hand -ventila te briefly after suction). 9. When the child's trachea has been well sucked -out and there is adequate depth of anaesthesia, remove the oral tube and replace it with a nasal uncuffed endotracheal tube. 10. Insert an IV drip and a nasogastric tube. Firmly splint both arms with splints that reach from the axilla to the wrist - this must be done carefully. Allow the child to wake up, and do not give any sedation unless this is needed for transport. 11. Put a condenser -humidifier on the tube. Careful and frequent suction (often after putting 0.5 -1 ml saline down the tube) is very important to prevent the copious thick secretions blocking the tube. 12. Children should be extubated when there is a leak around the tube, or at 24 -36 hours (>2 yr) or 36 -48 hours (<2 yr). Childre n with influenza or herpes simplex croup will need to be intubated for longer. 13. Do not give antibiotics unless there is bacterial tracheitis, which is very uncommon (many organisms of a single type seen on gram stain, with a heavy pure culture). Do not routinely culture tracheal aspirate for bacteria. 14. 95% of croup will resolve by 5 days. If a child has upper airway obstruction beyond 5 days, or if not typical croup (URTI symptoms), or cyanosis at any stage, do a chest xray and review for alternative diagnos is (subglottic stenosis or web, mediatinal mass, vascular sling). 77 DEATH OF A CHILD From within RCH, detailed information and all the necessary forms can be found under \"Death of a Child\" in the Clinical Practice Guidelines on the intranet at: www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/cpg.cfm?doc_id=5305 All cases Notify ICU Consultant, Bedcard Unit (who should arrange followup), referring doctor, GP. Complete ICU discharge procedures. If organ donation does not occur, record in the notes (1) why organ donation was not requested, or (2) that it was requested but that permission was refused. Ask the family if they will consent to a post -mortem. No report to Coroner Complete a Medical Certificate of Cause of Death, RCH autopsy form and consent form. Do not call the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death a \"death certificate\" - the death certificate is a document issued by the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriges. Report to Coroner Report the death to the Coroner if it is unexpected, unnatural, violent or an accident; occured during anaes thetic (even from natural causes); as a result of an anaes thetic or operative procedure ; a person held in care (eg. care order with DHS); a person of unknown identity , or the second child death in a family (reviewable death) . It is not always necessary to report a death to the Coroner just because it occured within 24 hours of an anaes thetic (unless i t occured during or as a result of the anaes - thetic or 63d29d263c81/flowchart+to+determine+whether+a+death+is+re portable+or+reviewable.pdf If in doubt about whether to report a death, ask the ICU consultant (who may discuss the case with the Coroner , or discu ss with a senior colleague ). Ring 96844444 to report the death. Record the Coroner's case number in the UR. Fill out a Coroner's deposition (summary of the case), with a copy for the Coroner, a copy for the notes, and a copy for you to keep. Ask family to complete a Statement of Body Identification. Lodge a request for no autopsy if family wants this. 78 A Medical Certificate of Cause of Death is not required. Inhibition of lactation If the mother requires inhibition of lactation, prescribe cabergoline (Dostinex) 1mg oral once . 79 DEATH - ORGAN DONATION Organ donation can occur after brain death (DBD), or following circulatory death (DCD) and should be considered in all children having withdrawal of intensive care. For the comple te guideline for Donation after Circulatory Death visit: http://www.rch.org.au/picu/Donation_after_cardiac_death_p rotocol/ 1. Diagnosis of brain death. The diagnosis of brain death requires unresponsive coma, absent brainstem reflexes and absent respiratory function. (See ANZICS Statement on Death and Organ Donation Edition 3.2) The necessary preconditions for clinical suspicion of brain death must be pre sent: The child has a condition known to cause brain death Norm al blood pressure (use age appropriate SBP) Body temperature >35oC and normoglycaemia No significant electrolyte or endocrine abnormalities Neuromuscular transmission is normal by train -of-four stimulus testing Significant drug intoxication (including morphine, benzodiazepines and barbiturates) has been excluded. (flumazenil and naloxone can be used to reverse benzodiazepine and opiate activity) The following are clinical tests of brainstem fun ction (In Victoria - must be performed by 2 doctors of 5 years experience): Test both eyes for corneal reflex + pupil response to light Vestibulo -ocular (caloric) test on at least one side (observe for at least 60 seconds) Do not perform an oculo -cephalic (doll's eye) test Gag and cough reflexes Test response to painful stimuli to limbs and supraorbital region (V cranial nerve distribution) Note: we no longer test for respiratory movement in response to hypercarbia and acidosis as this may lead to increase d intracranial pressure . Instead a test of cerebral blood flow, usually a radionucleide scan using Ceretec is done. Radionuclide scanning or 4 -vessel angiogram is used to demon - strate absence of blood flow above the carotid siphon. The time of death is recorded as the time when the second medical officer has confirmed the absence of cerebral blood flow 80 (ie reviewed the reported complete Ceretec scan) For children over 30 days of age : determination of brain death is the same as adults For neonates 36 we eks-29 days : determination of brain death is to be performed after 48 hours from birth. Second clinical exam should occur 24 hours after the first. All aspects of DBD can be performed by the treating intensivist. Management of haemodynamic instability s econdary to brain death Brain death can lead to a neuro -humoral response leading to profound circulatory instability which can last hours. Diabetes Insipidus, loss of sympathetic tone, hypothermia and lost pituitary function contribute to this. Diabetes I nsipidus - Vasopressin 2 -5 units in 1litre of fluid : replace urine output + 10% per hour OR 1 unit/kg in 50ml at 1- 3ml/hr (0.02 -0.06 units/kg/hr) Circulatory dysfunction - inotrop e myocardial dysfunction : based on echocardiographic findings and in consultation with the cardiac intensivist or cardiologist. Maintain normoglycaemia with infusion of 50% dextrose, or an infusion of insulin (0.05 -0.1 unit/kg/hr ) as needed. Treat coagulopathy with FFP. Give platelets if bleeding due to platelet count <50 x 109 Stable gas exchange (PaCO 2 + PaO 2 as close to normal as possible); prevent atelectasis (PEEP 5 -10 cm + ETT suction); use low tidal volumes to avoid volutrauma. 2. Donation following Circulatory Death (DCD) Main considerations DCD is to be considered for all patients where withdrawal of life sustaining therapies is going to occur. The intensivist, the treating unit consultant and the family must agree on withdrawal of life sustaining therapies first before consideration of organ donation . All units involved must document thi s in the medical record. Designated intensivist - a second intensivist provide s the donation counselling and seek s consent for DCD. Designated officer (representing the hospital) - a number of senior medical staff are registered as designated officers and their consent on behalf of the hospital is required to permit DCD to occur . Usually a member of the RCH executive. 81 Medical suitability - is determined by transplantation teams so referral to the organ procurement agency (Donatelife) is indicated even to d iscuss potential suitability. DCD is not possible if the child is likely to breathe for 90 minutes following withdrawal of life sustaining therapy . See PICU intranet for complete protocol. 3. Coroner. In a Coroner's case, the ICU consultant should discuss organ donation with the duty coroner via the on -call pathologist at the Coroner's office . ICU medical staff should complete a Coroner's Deposition (found at https://secure.vifm.org/m eddep/ ) and a Statement of Body Identification. Police will attend as agents of the Coroner , and they may or may not wish to speak to parents in the ICU . Warn parents of this possibility, and that this is routine practice . 4. Serology and other tests. Most ante -mortem tests are conducted with the instruction of the donor co -ordinator from Donatelife if the parents have agreed to organ donation: 10 ml clotted blood (gel tube) should be sent via RCH Core Laboratory for urgent hepatitis B, C & D; HIV 1 & 2 a nd CMV serology; ECG; cardiac for contractility, valve function, vegetation and anatomical abnormality. Bronchoscopy may be indicated. 5. Donor coordinator (Don atelife) notification. After brain death has been certified or DCD has been consented for , RCH staff (usually the ICU consultant) will conduct the initial discussion with the parents about the meaning and significance of brain death and about organ donation. If parental consent is obtained, the donor coordinator will be contacted by the ICU consultant and will meet the parents. The 24 hour contact phone number for the duty Donatelife donor coordinator is 9347 0408 . The donor c oordinator needs the child's age , weight , diagnosis and previous medical history , blood group , all current medication s, LFTs , urea and creatinine , hepatitis B, C and D, HIV 1 and 2, and CMV status. The donor coordinator will : meet the parents and discuss the process of organ donation; notify the recipient coord inators; coordinate the activity of the organ removal teams; book theatres for organ removal; notify the anaesthetist for the donor; notify ICU of the likely theatre ti me. 82 Provide the Donatelife donor co -ordinator a space with computer access, supervised access to the child's EMR and introduce them to the nurse in charge. They may not be familiar with the PICU or staff. 5. Requirements of recipient transplant teams. These should be discussed by the donor coordinator with the individual recipient teams and then with the RCH ICU con sultant. Important considerations (apart from ABO group, serology and exclusion criteria such as dissem inated malignancy, active auto -immu ne disease and presence of some inborn metabolic errors such as mucopolysaccharid oses vasopressin, electrolytes, LFTs, clotting profile, glucose. Pancreas: age, Low BP, high dose inotropes, blood glu cose and serum amylase, abdominal trauma. Heart: age, weight, hypotension, use of high dose inotro pes, cardiac echo examination including assessment of contractility, ECG, CXR. Lungs: age, size, weight, hypotension, high dose inotropes, cardiac echo, bronchoscopy, ECG, CXR, and blood gases after 15 minutes on 100% O 2 and 5 cm PEEP. Corneas: age, eye injury or ulceration. Age should not be considered a contraindication to donation. Case by case consideration will be applied to potential infant and neonatal donors. 6. Booking of theatre time. The donor coordin ator will contact theatre nursing staff and the ana esthetist in charge, in order to book the case. In -hours, this can be done by ringing the duty anaesthetist (ext 52000). The organ procurement procedure needs to be booked on the electronic medical record. 7. Planning for transfer of the child from inte nsive care unit to theatre . For donor patients who are brain dead , intensive care should be notified of the anticipated theatre time by the donor coordinator as soon as possible. For DCD donors a pre - withdrawal planning meeting will occur with all relevant operating theatre staff, anaesthetists, surgeons , and the designated intensivist. 8. Parents and visitors. Well in advance t he ICU consultant will discuss with parents and visitors the procedure for taking the child to theatre. Parents and visitors will say their farewells in the patient's ICU room and will then leave the ICU. They should not accompany the child to the theatre. 9. Intra -operative management of brain dead donors. In 83 general the medical management commenced in ICU should be continued. Mus cle relaxants should be given to prevent spinal reflex movements. The order of organ procurement will be decided by surgeons. Drugs that are usually required intraoperatively include heparin, methylprednisolone and antibiotics. The exact dosage and timing of dosage should be discussed with the surgeons involved and/or the donor coordinator. Femoral lines will not be useful if and when the IVC is cross -clamped, so intravenous access in the upper body must be available. 10. Postoperative management. The duty social worker will arrange for the parents and friends to view the child's body after the procedure if they wish to . At the end of the procedure, the donor is taken to the mortuary to prepare for transfer to the funeral director or Coroner's office . For Coron er's cases the office should be informed when the patient arrives at the mortuary. 11. Pastoral care - participation in organ donation is stressful and can be distressing . PICU can facilitate debriefs soon after the event. Staff are encouraged to seek help, internally or externally, for persistent or unresolved distress. 12. Hospital Donation Specialists - Any concerns regarding organ donation at RCH can be relayed to the PICU medical donation specialist or nursing donation specialist 84 DEATH - TISSUE DONATION Tissue donation can occur within 24 hours of death. This is feasible for patients who die in PICU or other locations in the hospital. Enquiries in relation to tissue donation can be made at the Donor Tissue Bank of Victoria ( DTBV; Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine) ph 9684 4444 in hours or 0407326705 after hours. Standard tissue donation and age criteria Cardiovascular tissue - Standard donation: aortic valve, pulmonary valve and pericardium Age: 3 months (no weight criteria as long as babies were born at full term with no growth restrictions in utero). Skin Standard donation: superficial layer of skin from upper back, flanks, posterior upper/lower legs and anterior upper legs Age: no specific age limit but depends on size. Very small body surface areas and bony prominences may be excluded. Bone Standard donation: femur, and Achilles , tibialis (anterior) and patella Age: From 18 years Eyes : Corneas - will consider 2 -6 years. Confirm with Lions Eye Donation Service (LEDS) Sclera and eye research - May accept any age. Confirm with LEDS Procedures to be followed 1. When heart valve donation is proposed, the transplant coordinator should be notified as soon as possible. Note that for tissue donation an autopsy will be required , and the DTBV Medical and Social History Questionnaire (F000) must be completed. 2. Potential donors should meet all the criteria listed in Part B, Medical Acceptance for Heart Valve Donors. The suit ability of the donor will be discussed with the treating doctor by the donor coordinator at the time of referral. 85 3. When the suitability of the donor has been established, the transplant coordinator will coordinate with the car diac surgeon on-call and arrange transport details with ward and anatomical pathology. 4. The transplant coordinator will be responsible for dis cussing the option of donation with the family and comple ting the necessary form s for consent or denial. 5. A copy of the consent will be provided for inclusion in the donor medical history. 6. When the donor is a Coroner's case, the transplant co ord- inator will be responsible for dealing with the family. However, in such cases, the autopsy if ordered by the coroner will be perfor med at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine. 7. Blood for serology will be collected at autopsy and for warded to DTBV for testing by a TGA licensed lab. 8. The parents should be informed that the child will be tested for HIV, and that a brain biopsy will be needed for CJD (although this may change). PART B. MEDICAL ACCEPTANCE FOR HEART VALVE DONATION The following criteria must be me t: Death certified and recorded in the patient's history. The patient does not have active systemic infection. There is no evidence of active infection involving the tissues to be retrieved. There is no evidence of present or past slow virus disease. There is no clinical history of active tuberculosis. There is no clinical history of syphilis. There is no evidence of malignancy. There is no history of active hepatitis or unexplained jaundice. There is no diffuse connective tissue disorder, metabolic bone disease, or other serious disorder or disease of unknown aetiology, including rheumatoid arthritis. The cause of death is known. There is no history of non -medical parenteral drug use in the patient, or in the parents if the patient is being breast -fed. There is no history of irradiation to the mediastinum. There is no history of ingestion or administration of toxic substances that might be transferred in heart valves or arteries. There is no history of dementia or neurologic degenerative disease. There is no history of living in the UK for a cumulative per iod of more than 6 months between 1980 and 1996. There is no clinical evidence of HIV infection. The patient has not received pituitary growth hormone 86 The patient has not received human derived clotting fac tor concentrates for treatment of haemophilia. The patient has not been identified as being at high risk for HIV infection. If the patient is being breast fed, the parents have not been identified as being at high risk for HIV infection. 87 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS Children with diabetic ketoacidosis should be admitted to ICU if they are less than 2yr old, or if there are signs of cerebral oedema. The major risks are cerebral oedema, rapid changes in serum osmolality (usually caused by over rehydration and/or hypo glycaemia, wors ening acidosis (due to hypovolaemia or lack of insulin), and severe hyper - kalaemia or hypokalaemia. Insulin 2.5u/kg , increase to 0.1u/kg/hour if blood sugar not falling. When the blood glucose is less than 12 mmol/L: give more intravenous dextrose do NOT stop insulin or reduce <0.05 u/kg/hr. While on an insulin infusion: do glucose hrly, + elec 2 -4H, urinary ketones 6H do hourly neuro obs (bradycardia a major calculate effective plasma osmolality 2 -4 hrly = 2[Na+] + [glucose]. Do not give insulin routinely for hyperosmolar non ketotic diabetes (ketonuria no more than one plus). 1. Assess clinica l condition. If only very mildly dehydrated and not vomiting or acidotic, proceed to protocol for stabilisation rather than emergency treatment. 2. Give nil by mouth (except ice to suck). Insert a naso gastric tube if the patient is comatose or has repeated v omiting, and leave on free drainage. 3. Take blood for glucose, electrolytes, plasma osmolality, acid - base studies. In newly diagnosed patients, do islet cell antibodies, insulin antibodies, GAD antibodies, total IgA, anti - endomysial IgA antibody, and thyroid function. 4. Check urine for ketones and presence of infection. 5. Commence resuscitation without waiting for results. 6. Nurse head -up 15o (in coma position if unconscious). 7. Check for precipitating cause, eg infections (check injection sites, urine, consider blood culture and CXR). 8. Use diabetic ketoacidosis chart to improve monitoring. 9. Blood transfusion is almost never necessary. Resuscitation and rehydration 1. Children with DKA who are hypotensive should be given 10 ml/kg boluses 0.9% saline until blood pressure is normal. A guide to minimum acceptable systolic BP 75 75 75 80 80 85 90 95 95 2. Because of the risk of DVT, do not put in a central line unless it is absolutely necessary. If a CVC is used, give heparin 10 u/kg/hr through the line. 3. After restoration of blood pressure, all children with DKA and unequivocal signs of dehyd ration should be given the following amount of IV fluid (based on maintenance requirements of 80% of normal, and 3 -5% dehydration corrected over 48 hours) irresp ective of their apparent degree of dehydration: Wt (kg) 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 14 16 18 20 25 30 35 40 45 ml/hr 24 28 32 36 40 45 50 55 65 70 75 80 90 95 105 110 This fluid rate (ml/hr) includes deficit AND maintenance fluid needs. The degree of dehydration is often over estimated in children. Fluid therapy should be reviewed if oliguria develops: tubular necrosis caused by severe hypo tension before resuscitation may require fluid restriction, but persistent hypovolaemia may require extra fluid. 4. Type of fluid a. 0.9% NaCl is to be used for the first 24 hours, then Plasma - lyte 148 in 5% dextrose. At the time of starting the insulin infusion, add KCI to the saline at 40 mmol/L if body weight <30kg, and at 60 mmol/L if >30kg. b. When the blood glucose falls below 12 mmol/L, either add dextrose to the maintenance fluid (i.e, make it 5% or change 0.9% NaCl to Plasma -lyte 148 with 5% glucose) , or (only if there is a central line) give 50% dextrose IV at 0.5 ml/kg/hr (max imum 10 ml/hr). Adjust the dose of dextrose to keep the blood glucose at 8 -12 mmol/L. If the blood glucose falls below 8 mmol/L, increase the dextrose infusion rate - DO NOT STOP THE INSULIN INFUSION. Insulin Infusion a. Start the insulin infusion together with the KCI replace ment after the initial resuscitation has been completed and the patient is in ICU. b. Add 2.5 unit/kg of clear or rapid -acting insulin (Actrapid HM or Humulin R) to 50 ml 0.9% NaCl , and run at 1 ml/hr (0. 05 u/kg/hr of insulin). This dose provides near maximal glucose clearance; lower doses may be needed to prevent a rapid fall in blood gluc ose. The insulin infu sion may be run as a sideline with the rehydrating fluid via a three -way tap providing a 89 volumetric or syringe pump is used. Ensure that the insulin infusion is clearly labelled. Insulin is infused in 4% albumin to reduce adsorption t o the tubing. c. Adjust the dextrose infusion rate to keep the glucose level at 8-12 mmol/L. Remember that insulin is needed to clear the acidosis (ketonaemia) and adequate insulin must be continued IV or SC until the ketones have cleared. The insulin infu sion rate can be increased if the acidosis does not improve by at least 0.03 pH unit/hour, increase the % dextrose infused if necessary. d. The best time to change to SC insulin is just before a meal, when the child is alert and metabolically stable (glucose <8 -12 mmol/L, pH >7.30 and HCO 3 >15). The insulin infusion should only be stopped 30 minutes after the first SC injection of insulin. Potassium Replacement Potassium replacement should begin at the same time as the insulin in fusion is commenced. Start KCI at a conc entration of 40-60 mmol/L body wt <30 kg, and 60 mmol/L if 30 kg or above). If K levels are tending low, check with venous or arterial K (rather than capillary). Extreme care should be taken if the in itial serum K is >5.5 mmol/L or if the may increase the risk of cerebral oedema . A low pH is not in itself harmful if the child has a good cardiac output and good peripheral perfusion. Worsening acidosis usually means hypo - volaemia, insufficient insulin, hyperchloraemia from 0.9% NaCl, or tissue necrosis from ischaemic injury before adequate resuscitation. CLOSE CLINICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL MONITORING Clinic al a. Document fluid balance carefully. All urine should be measured, and tested for ketones at least 6 hourly. All fluid input should be recorded (including oral). b. Record observations hourly for 24 hr: pulse, blood pres sure, respiratory rate, level of consciousness and pupils. See cerebral oedema, below. c. Record temperature 4 hourly. Biochemical These tests may have to be performed more frequently. Use the DKA flow chart. While on an insulin infusion do: a. Hourly blood glucose levels, and 6 hourly urine ket ones 90 b. 2-4 hrly blood gases, sodium, potassium, chloride and urea. Calculate the effective plasma osmolality 2 -4 hrly = 2[Na+] + [glucose]. If capillary bloods are done, beware of falsely high K+ levels. Aim to prevent the effect ive plasma osmolality falling faster than 0.5 mmol/L per hour; the plasma Na+ will have to rise to compensate for the fall in glucose (and K+). It may be neces sary to give 3% saline (4 ml/kg over 6 hr raises sodium by 3 mmol/L). Do not use the \"corrected sodium\" to monitor therapy. HAZARDS OF THERAPY 1. HYPOGLYCAEMIA. Treat hypoglycaemia with 50% dextrose 1 ml/kg infused over 3 minute s, and by increasing the amount of dextrose infused. Do not discontinue the insulin infusion or reduce it to less than 0. 05 u/kg/hour. If venous access cannot be obtained, give oral or NG 50% dextrose 1 ml/kg, glucagon 1 mg IM and notify the ICU consultan t. Preven tion includes adding dextrose to the IV fluids when the blood glucose has fallen to 12 - 15 mmol/L 2. CEREBRAL OEDEMA. Subclinical brain swelling is present during most episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis. Clinic al signs of cerebral oedema occur suddenly, usually 6 -12 hr after starting therapy (range 2 -24hr). Mortality or severe morbidity is very likely without early treatment. Risk factors: first presentation, long history of poor control, age <5 yr; failure of sodium to rise as glucose levels decline, development of hyponatraemia, initial low osmo lality; HEAD - ACHE, behavioural changes such as irritability, lethargy and depressed level of consciousness. BRADY CARDIA, INCREASED BP, AND RESPIRATORY IMPAIR MENT are late signs of raised intra cranial pressure. Prevention: The most important factor is SLOW correction of the fluid and biochemical abnor malit ies - osmolality (2Na + glucose) should not fall faster than 0.5 mmol/L per hour . Nurse 15o head up. Treatment: a. Mannitol 20% should always be readily available; the dose is 2.5 ml/kg (0.5g/kg) IV stat. This can be repeated every 15 -20 minutes. It should be given as soon as the clinical diagnosis is made - it should NOT be delayed for confirmatory brain scans. b. Fluid input should be severely reduced and changed to 0.9% 91 NaCl with added dextrose. c. Transfer immediately to ICU. HYPEROSMOLAR NONKETOTIC DIABETES Some children have very high blood glucose levels without marked ketosis (ketonuria no more than one plus); t he pH is usually > 7.10; they are often obese, and may have axillary freckling. There may be severe dehydration. These children are at very high risk of cerebral oedema. Start with boluses of 0.9% saline 10ml/kg IV to correct hypo volaemia, then slower as for ketoacidosis (see Resuscitation and Rehydration, above). The effective osmolality (2Na + glucose) must not fall faster than 0.5 mmol/L per hour. Insulin is NOT needed initially, and is dangerous if it causes an abrupt fall in effective osmolality. Rhabdo myolysis , renal failure and gut i schaemia may occur . If insulin is required for severe hyperkalaemia (consider haemofiltration rather than insulin) or for moderate ketosis that does not resolve with rehydration (mixed DKA and hyperosmolar syndrome), start with only 0.01 u/kg/hr (0.5 u/k g in 50ml 0.9% NaCl at 1ml/hr). 92 DISASTER - CODE BROWN See the Emergency Displan Folder in each room in ICU. The ED Consultant is likely to be the first person aware of the Emergency. They communicate to the Director of Operations, or Nursing Hospital Manager, who in -turn communicates with the Hospital Commander who determines if a Code Brown, or Code Brown Standby is announced. The ED Consultant will activate a trauma page as required, and will liaise di rectly with the PICU General consultant regarding the event ASAP. PICU Notification PICU Consultant will notify: AUM Clinical Technologist Other Consultant medical staff as indicated below and ICU registrars AUM will notify: NUM Nursing staff on duty Ward Clerk PSAs PICU areas of responsibility PICU general unit / flexipod PICU cardiac unit PICU will set up and staff an annex in operating t heatre recovery area to decant less unwell patients . Some children can be moved to the wards , or to this PICU annex staffed by PICU nurses and a n ICU registrar. This will free up PICU beds for Code Brown admissions. The PICU General consultant will oversee the transfer of children to this area, and their subsequent care. If needed PICU will also staff 2 beds in the Medic al Imaging Recovery bay , requiring 3 nurses and a senior registrar . The intention is to hold no more than 2 patients in this area while waiting for CT , but with full ventilation, inotrope, resuscitation facilities as needed . If a child is likely to ne ed to wait more than 2 hours before CT or OT , they will be transferred to PICU and return ed when ready . If neces sary (eg at the request of State Displan Coordinator) PICU will provide a team to go to the disaster site (ICU registrar + a nurse from ICU or Emerg ency Department or recovery) for triage and site resusc itation . Will use PETS equipment , plus site team equipment as needed . 93 ROLE DESCRIPTIONS FOR KEY ICU PERSONNEL ICU Associate Unit Manager (AUM).

Locate and assemble equipment requ ired (in ICU, from other wards, or from outside RCH); per form special tasks as needed (eg. set up haemofiltr ation); en sure adequate gas supplies and electrical connections for patients managed in remote locations (eg. NNU and DSU); assist in transfer of patients. See the RCH Intranet home page: Emergency Procedures - Code Brown 96 DIURETIC THERAPY Intravenous frusemide should be given slowly , at a maxi mum rate of 0.05 mg/kg/min (eg 1 mg/kg over at least 20 min). Frusemide has a half -life of only 30 -120 minutes so, in comparison to 3 -6 hourly intermittent administration, a continuous infu sion gives less fluctuation in urine output and CVP, lower dose requirements, and less urine sodium and chloride loss . How ever, vancomycin - so another IV lin e is often needed for a continuous infusion. If mixed at a Y connection just before the patient, frusemide is compatible with adrenaline, al diuresis, spir ono- lactone can be given with frusemide (unless low doses are being used for just a few days). If a strong diuretic effect is required, give hydrochloro thiazide (a tubular diuretic) as well as frusemide (a loop diuretic) and spironolactone. The risk of severe hypokalaemia with this combin ation can be reduced by spironolactone + hydrochlorothiazide + aceta - zolamide is a very potent combination that may cause hypo - natraemi a and hypovolaemia. It s hould be used for no more than a few days, with close monitoring of electrolytes , acid -base and intravascular volume. 97 ECLS - ECMO Indications : Progressive respiratory (VV-ECMO) and/or cardiac (VA-ECMO) failure not responsive to maximal medical management. cVAD for single ventricular failure (ALCAPA, TGA) or bridge to long -term Irreversibility underlying condition, GA<34 weeks, intracerebral bl eed, post -BMT. Every ECMO referral should be discussed with the ECLS consultant on call, especially where there are relative contraindications or uncertainty DP3 circuit of VA flows. Higher flows needed in sepsis and CHD with systemic to pulmonary shunts. Monitor blood flow & SvO 2 with Spectrum monitor. Target inlet pressure > - 20mmHg, plasma Hb <0.1g/L. Gas Exchange: Initial sweep gas to flow ratio 0.7:1 if <10kg & 1:1 if>10kg. FiO 2 0.5. ventilation: 10 x 20/10 with FiO 2 0.3-0.5.

ECMO management Order 1 unit of RBC if cross match available or 1 unit of O -Neg irradiated blood if cross match not available. A clear prime circuit can be used during ECPR and if 10kg. needed during the ECMO run. Ensure good central venous access with extension so taps accessible when patient draped, volume attached. Ensure good arterial access & obtain ABG soon post cannulation. Cannulation site based on type of supp ort, patient age and underlying condition (see Intranet guideline). Cannulae positon and adequacy of support to be reviewd by team members through CXR & echo within 1 hour from cannulation (Huddle). 98 Invasive procedures on ECMO are discouraged and need to be discussed with ECLS consultant. For sedation on ECMO & weaning off support see Intranet guideline. 99 ECLS - DURABLE (LONG -TERM ) VAD Eligibility criteria for durable VA D insertion: 1. Transplant candidacy confirmed by formal assessment 2. Cardiac or end organ recovery likely within 4 weeks of adequate circulatory support Patient selection and timing: Timing and indication for device support should be defined , and destination Risk factors include wei ght < 5kg, end organ dysfunction , need for biventricular support, or single ventricle physiology Most children receive ECMO or centrifugal VAD prior to conversion to durable VAD Primary durable VAD insertion should be considered for those without end organ dysfunction Centrifugal VAD (< 14 days ) may be used to allow for end organ recovery Chronic inotrope or ventilator dependance can be indications for durable support Device selection is determined by patient and ventricular size Long term venous access inserted at time of durable VAD cannulatio n VAD Configuration (In order of increasing risk) Left ventricular (LV apex to ascending aorta) Right ventricular (Right Biventricular (RA:PA pulmonary arteries) Surgical considerations: Optimal inflow cannula placement must be confirmed by VAD operation and TOE Closure of residual intracardiac shunts Aortic incompetence is poorly tolerated, consider valve repair or replacement (not closure) Tricuspid valve repair may reduce the risk of right heart failure VAD devices used at RCH Berlin Heart (EXCOR) Paracorporeal pulsatile device 100 Patient size < 20kg / LVESD < 40mm Pneumatic driving system (IKUS) Pump size 10 / 15 / 25 / 30 / 50 ml Initial anticoagulation with Heparin, aspirin and clopidogrel start 6-24 hours post op , then convert to long term Warfarin or Clexane for infants Usual operating parameters (discuss with VAD team) VAD rate 60 - 120 bpm systolic pressure +50 mmHg above patient systolic diastolic pressure -20 to -50 mmHg systolic time 30 - 40% it is not appropriate to titrate VAD settings to MAP Berlin Heart clinical practice tips 1. Poor chamber filling; - Assess preload / rhythm / RV function / PVR / pleural effusion or tamponade / cannula position - High mean airway pressure will affect venous return - Consider volume / ECHO / decrease VAD rate or % systole / diastolic pressure more negative 2. Poor chamber emptying; - Assess afterload / out let cannula position / chamber for thrombus - Consider dilator / increase systolic pressure or % systole / decrease VAD rate 3. Fibrin / clot in chamber; - Review anticoagulation / notify VAD team - Consider CT brain even for subtle neurological changes 4. Pneumatic or driver malfunction; - Hand pump (60 - 90 bpm) / cardiac call -out / change IKUS unit - Oxygenate, ventilate and support the RV Heartware HVAD - Intracorporeal centrifugal continuous flow pump (160g) - Patient size > 20kg / LVESD > 45m m - Driveline connects to controller and batteries - Anticoagulate with warfarin and aspirin Usual operating parameters (discuss with VAD team) - Speed 2200 - 3200 rpm (device range 1800 - 4000 rpm) - Estimated flow determined by speed, power (variabl e) and blood viscosity (HCT) - Continuous flow pumps are preload dependent and afterload sensitive 101 - MAP should be maintained < 80mmHg (< 70 mmHg for younger child) - It is not appropriate to titrate VAD settings to MAP Heartware clinical practice tips 1. Baseline flow and amplitude; - Maintain baseline >2L/min, increase speed - Maintain amplitude > 2 L/min, amplitude will decrease with increasing speed - Baseline flow should never fall below 0 (regurgitant region) 2. Decreased estimated flow; - Low amplitude waveform = RV failure or tamponade - consider volume / iNO / inotropes / ECHO / CT mediastinum - High amplitude waveform = systemic hypertension - Anaemia presents as decreased estimated flow over days (check VAD HCT) 3. Increased estimated flow; - Low amplitude or aortic High amplitude waveform = hypervolaemia - Pump thrombosis presents as increased estimated flow over days 4. Aortic valve function; - Intermittent aortic valve opening may be benef icial - Aortic incompetence is poorly tolerated, reduce after load and device speed - Increasing device speed with significant aortic incompetence will lead to low cardiac output 5. Patient may not have a palpable pulse 6. Oscillometric BP not reliable, use Doppler method 7. No external 'hand pump' and CPR is not recommended 8. Usual Mx for defibrillation and APLS - oxygenate, ventilate and support the RV 102 ENDOTRACHEAL TUBES <10yr: use a nas al endotracheal tube (but n ot if there is a possible fracutured base of skull, or coagulopathy). >10yr: use an oral endotracheal tube (unless there is a particular reason to use a nasal tube). We now use Microcuff ETTs for all children , except those with croup . - On insertion of an ETT, listen for an air leak around the tube. If no leak is heard, insert a smaller tube - Once a leak is heard, inflate the cuff with air via the one way valve until the leak just disap ears. Record the amount of air in the cuff on the vital signs chart - With the introduction of Microcuff ETTs, which have a low pressure cuff, it is no longer neces sary to deflate the cuff for short periods frequently . - Remember that air can be absorbed into the cuff, even when it is not intentionally inflated. LARYNGEAL MASK AIRWAY SIZES Size 1 <5kg Size 3 30-50kg Size 1.5 5-10kg Size 4 50-70kg Size 2 10-20kg Size 5 70-100kg Size 2.5 20-30kg Size 6 >100kg CHEST PHYSIOTHERAPY Definite benefit. In chronic diseases with large amounts of sputum: cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, chronic ventilated patie nts; benefit may be from bagging -suction rather than vibration - percussion Possible benefit. Deep breathing exercises for atelectasis after cardiac surgery. Vibration -percussion probably harmful . No benefit, po tential harm . Pneumonia, bronchiolitis, acute asthma 103 EPIGLOTTITIS There is usually a low -pitched expiratory stridor in an un well, febrile child who is sitting up with an open mouth and drooling saliva. If there is a cough, it is usually just to expel saliva from the mouth, and it does not have the harsh bark ing quality found in children with croup. Epiglottit is is now very rare. This increases the risk that, when epiglottitis does occur, the diagnosis will be missed or man age- ment will be inappropriate. Almost all cases were caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b , but now occasional cases are due to other or ganisms (e.g. Staph or group A strep) or other cause of epiglotic injury / inflammation . Call the ICU consultant immediately if there is any sus picion of epiglottitis. 1. Do not lay the child down. 2. Do not examine the child's throat. 3. Give two doses of ceftriaxone: 100 mg/kg IM or IV stat, and 50 mg/kg after 24 hours , plus flucloxacillin is Staph suspected. 4. Steroids and adrenaline are not helpful. 5. Most children with epiglotittis will need to be intubated, but the procedure can be difficult. Obtain expert help before attempting intubation. It is performed as for croup. Achieve deep anaesthesia, do not put a pad under the shoulders, apply cricoid pressure, be prepared to as pirate copious saliva, and, if the tube sticks just below the cords, flex the neck a nd twist the tube on its long axis while gently pushing it down the trachea. Do not intubate without informing the ICU consultant. 6. Do not give paracetamol. Extubate when the child is afebrile, usually at 12 -24 hours. 104 FEVER - TREATMENT IN ICU Unparalysed* Paralysed Brain injury (head injury) Paracetamol if encephalitis, febrile fit), cardiac failure. Paracetamol often blanket), aim ineffective ; consider for 36 -37o low dose chlorpromazine or paralysis and cooling . Respiratory failure (croup, Paracetamol >38.5oC, Paracetamol pneumonia, bronchiolitis). aim for 37 -38oC. ( cooling blanket), aim for 37 -38o After cardiac surgery Paracetamol to Paracetamol achieve 37 - 38o ( cold PD) to achieve 37 - 38oC. May - thermia for some Epiglottitis Paracetamol only if > 40oC. *Do NOT nurse naked or use topical sponging, fans or cooling blankets in an unparalysed child - even if cooling to normothermia. Paracetamol may be needed to treat pain or discomfort (regardless of the temperature). - Fever does not cause pain (although many infections cause significant discomfort as well as fever). Do not give paracetamol routinely to treat fever (unless it is contributing to respiratory or cardiac failure, is causing an arrhythmia, or there is traumat ic or hypoxic brain injury , or pain ). Antipyretics increase viral shedding and impair the antibody response ; they prolong the illness in influenza, chickenpox, malaria, and perhaps measles ; and paracetamol does not prevent febrile convulsions. 105 FILTRATION Haemofiltration (veno -venous) Indications: Renal failure with fluid overload, hyperkalemia, acidemia or severe uremia and removal of toxins (inborn errors of metabolism and drug -toxicity non plasma -bound). Cannula: 6.5 Fr double lumen in newborn/infants (blood flow 8 - 10 ml/Kg/min), 8 Fr in child (blood flow 5 -8 ml/Kg/min), 11.5 Fr in teenager (blood flow 4 -6 ml/Kg/min), 13.5 Fr in adolescent or adult (blood flow 2 -4 ml/Kg/min). Max blood flow 200 -250 ml/min. Blood prime if weight < 10 Kg, Hb < 100 g/L or priming volume > 15% of circulating volume. Filter: Removes particles of MW up to approx 30,000 da. Filtrate: 20-35 ml/kg/hr (monitor serum creatinine), main tain ratio of blood/filtrate flow of 5 or more. In sepsis keep filtrate 50 mls/kg/hr. In Hypermmonemia 500 \u00b5mol/L, rhabdomyolysis associated renal dysfunction (see Rhabdomyolisis) or fulminant/hyperacute liver failure use high -flow filtration with UFR>200 ml/Kg/h . To achieve such high filtration rate , accept a blood/filtrate ratio of 3:1 and/or increase the filter surface area by using a bigger filter or 2 filters in series. For hyperammonaemia also lactulose 1ml/kg of 3.3g/5ml every hour until loose stools are produced, then 6 - 8 hourly, and ammonia s cavangers ( see METABOLIC - HYPERAMMONAEMIA ). 10 U/Kg/h pre -filter and titrate to keep ACT 1.5 x normal (Actalyke 140 -160 seconds); post -filter Heparin of pre -filter Heparin.

Calcium Chloride 10% infusion post -filter at approx 3 -5% of ACD flow rate. In children < 2 years recieveing RCH solution start Calcium Choloride 10% infusion at 1 -2 ml/h. Maintain patient 1.0 2-Heparin -Protamine: start Heparin infusion at 10 U/Kg/h pre - filter and titrate to keep the circuit ACT 1.5 x normal (Acta lyke 140-160 seconds); post -filter Heparin. Administer 1 mg/h of Protamine for every 100 units/h of total Heparin into the returning arm (venous side) of the VasCath to gain normal ACT in patient (90 -120 seconds). In reg ional Anticoagulation, if red and blue lumen of the VasCath are swapped, the risk of recirculation is high and Calcium or Protamine must be administered directly to the patient via CVL. Plasmafiltration (veno -venous) Indication : Removal of large molecular weight substances from blood (autoantibodies, immunocomplexes,) and intoxications with drugs that are highly protein (beta -Blockers, Calcium -channel blockers, (blood flow 8 - 10 ml /Kg/min), 8 Fr in child (blood flow 5 -8 ml/Kg/min), 11.5 Fr in teenager (blood flow 4 -6 ml/Kg/min), 13.5 Fr in adolescent or adult (blood flow 2 -4 ml/Kg/min). Filter: Removes particles of MW up to 2,000,000 da. Filtrate: 1.5-2 plasma volume exchange (max 3-3.5 L) over 4 -6 hours. Maintain ratio of blood/filtrate flow of 5 or more.

Aim for 4 -6mg/kg/min Give enteral nutrition wherev er possible If needed in infants on restricted fluids, infusions of 50% glucose at low rates can be used to maintain normoglycaemia. 50% dextrose must be given by a central line. It should not be given as a bolus. For the treatment of hypoglycaemia, use 2ml/kg of 10% dextrose, then increase glucose intake (start or increase enteral feeds, increase glucose concentration in maintenance fluid, add low rate infusion of 50% dextrose if CVC. Never give insulin without a source of intravenous glucose in a non-diabetic patient Peritoneal dialysis Cycles. Ventilated: 10 -20 ml/kg/cycle (in/dwell TESTING COMPLEX CONDITIONS Recently whole exome sequencing (WES) has become available and evaluated in children in ICU, showing a high yield of recognisable single gene defects for children with undiagnosed syndromes, and that the identification of a genet ic diagnosis often changes management. Early referral to Genetics for consideration of WES should occur for children with complex undiagnosed conditions who are seriously ill. These conditions include: Metabolic disorders with lactic acidosis Immunodeficiency or bone marrow failure Many of these disorders can be diagn osed with simpler, more targeted tests, and often Genetics and other departments will already be involved, so check what diagnostic tests have already been done. If management may change on the basis of a specific genetic diagnosis, discuss with the bed -card unit and refer to Genetics for WES. 110 GUILLAIN -BARRE SYNDROME Progressive weakness with reduced reflexes, often starting in legs and arms about 10 days after an infection of respira tory tract (eg. mycoplasma) or bowel (eg. C jejuni ). Usually symmetrical, often muscle pain and parathesiae, cranial nerves may be involved, usually afebrile, may be severe autonomic dysfunction. CSF protein >0.9 g/l, cells <10 per mm3. CK normal or moderately transverse myelitis, tick paraly sis, NPA for M pneumoniae PCR if respiratory illness. Consider tests for ANF , HIV, Zika virus in certain circumstances . Immunoglobulin 1g/kg IV over 8 hr daily for 2 doses. If no response after 3 -5 days, consider plasmafiltration 50ml/kg exchange alternate days to total 250ml/kg , then give (or repeat) immunoglobulin . 1. Steroids are proba bly not effective. 2. Measure vital capacity using spirometer if possible. Ventilate if vital capacity below 20 -25 ml/kg , or if drooling, no cough or poor bulbar function . Low pO 2 and high CO 2 are late signs; ventilate before they occur. Weak children may no t appear distressed despite maximal respiratory effort. 3. Autonomic dysfunction may cause serious hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia; sudden death may occur. Monitor ECG and blood pressure closely. Avoid hypovolaemia. Pacing is seldom need ed for bradycardia in children , sometimes aminophylline useful for bradycardia . 4. Catheterisation may needed urinary retention. Constipation may be severe; erythromycin or neostig mine may help. 5. Pain may be severe. Try paracetamol, and gabapentin 15mg /kg daily NG. If this is inadequate, add tramadol 2 -8 mcg/kg/min. Morphine may be required, but worsens constipation. Carbamazepine is less effective than gabapentin; amitriptyline is more effective than gabapentin, but may exacer bate autonomic i nstability. Steroids probably do not reduce pain. 6. Enoxaparin and stockings should be used in adults, but not in children. 7. Children with GBS will almost all recover. Delayed recovery or poor outcome more likely if (a) a ventilated patient has not started t o improve within 18 -21 days of reaching peak deficit; (b) if ventilation is needed early; (c) EMG shows absent motor 111 responses or axonal involvement; or (d) there is C jejuni or CMV infection. 112 HAEMATOLOGY Compatible blood groups WHOLE PACKED CRYO - PATIENT BLOOD RED CELLS FFP PRECIP O O O Any O A A or O* A or O A or AB A B B or O* B or O B or AB A AB Any* Any AB A *Low titre gp O blood; do not use whole blood. Platelets : donor preferably has same ABO and Rh groups as recipient, otherwise usually as for FFP. Avoid giving FFP or platelets rapidly for hypovolaemia: they may cause vasodilation and severe hypotension. Except in an emergency, all blood given to ICU patients should be irradiated just before administration. In ICU, unless the patient is known to be CMV +ve, give CMV - ve blood or use an Imugard III -RC filter. Plate lets will usually have been leucocyte filtered by central blood bank. If giving unfiltered platelets (from interstate), use an Imugard III -PL filter. Contact Blood Bank and on -call haematologist and a ctivate massive transfusion protocol if transfusion requirement >40ml/kg of PRBC. https://www.transfusion.com.au/disease_therapeutics/transfusi on IMMAT URE / TOTAL NEUTROPHIL RATIO (I/T RATIO) The immature to total neutrophil ratio is a useful guide to the presence of sepsis in ICU patients - it is much more accurate than the total neutrophil count. The I/T ratio is calculated from the number of immature neutrophils (blasts and myelocytes + bands) divided by the total number of neutrophils (immature + mature) in the peripheral blood. The I/T ratio is usually < 0.2 in young infants, and <0.15 over about 3 months of age. After cardiopulmonary by pass, the I/T ratio is usually <0.5 (day 1), <0.35 (day 2), <0.3 (day 3), <0.25 (days 4 -5), and <0.2 thereafter. The change from day to day is more informative than a sin gle absolute value - eg. a ratio of 0.25 on day 5 would be reassuring if it had been 0.40 the day before, but sug gestive of sepsis if it had been only 0.10 the day before. In addition, the acute onset of neutropenia strongly sug - gests sepsis (even if the I/T ratio is normal ). Integrate the results of the I /T ratio with serum procalcitonin in deciding to scale down or cease antibiotics if cultures negative at 48 hours. 113 HEAD INJURY Summary: severe traumatic brain injury: SSEP day 2 , MRI . A. INTUBATION AND VENTILATION For all patients who present with: a. flaccid or extensor (decerebrate) or flexor (decorticate) b. or deteriorating conscious state c. or respiratory failure. Maintain a Pa CO 2 of 35 -40 mmHg, oxygen saturation >90%, and provide PEEP of 5 cm H 2O. B. PARALYSIS, SEDATION, ANALGESIA Following initial neurological assessment: 1mg/kg in 50ml) IV before painful procedures e .g. turning in a child with fractures , leave adequate time to take effect (5 -10 minutes) . 2. Sedat ion a. midazolam 1 -4mcg/kg/min b. give extra boluses of midazolam 0.2 mg/kg if response to stimuli (eg. tachy cardia, increased blood pressure or lacrimation on passive movement of limbs) or high ICP, and consider increasing infusion (up to 18mcg/kg/min used rarely) or adding diazepam 0.1 mg/kg 4H slow IV. 3. When thiopentone is used all other sedative drugs should be ceased. (Morphine/fentanyl can be left on a small dose if significant pain likely) . If thiopentone used, ideally do continuous EEG monitoring. 3. Paralysis a. all patients until verification of head injury status is obtained through CT scan b. all patients when it is decided to insert an ICP catheter c. all patients with sustained intracranial hypertension (paralyse 114 for at least 72 hours from t he time of injury) d. can use pancuronium: 0.1 -0.15 mg/kg prn or vecuronium 0.1mg/kg . Do not continue to paralyse the patient if a decision has been made not to insert an ICP catheter. Avoid vecuronium infusions, as likely to lead to prolonged neuromuscul ar paralysis. C. TEMPERATURE CONTROL 1. All patients should have active interventions to preserve normothermia (36 -37 oC), including a cooling blanket if required. While hypothermia (<35o C) reliably reduces ICP, it has unproven effects on mortality. Therefore outside of a research context, therapeutic hypothermia should be reserved for elevations of ICP refractory to other treatments. 2. For active cooling to therapeutic hypothermia, p atien ts are ventilated, paralysed and cooled using a cooling blanket to first 35 oC, then 32-33oC if ICPs remain uncontrolled. 3. Hypothermia is maintained until the ICP is stable and less than 20mmHg. 4. Rewarm gradually via a servo -controlled warming -cooling blanket. The patient's core temperature should be allowed to rise 0.5o every 3hr up to 36 -37oC (not over 37o); recool if the ICP rises sharply and the CPP falls. 5. Vasodilation is common during re warming, and intra vascular filling \u00b1 noradrenaline is often needed. 6. Do not wean sedatives until ICP stable for 12 hr with cooling blanket turned off. 7. Nutritional requirements are significantly reduced while temperature <36oC 8. With hypothermia infection risk is increased (and clinical signs are masked - i.e. no fever), cease hypothermia if signs of VAP, neutropenia, increased procalcitonin or rising IT ratio . D. MAINTAIN CARDIAC OUTPUT 1. Correct hypovolaemia: IV 0.9% sali ne, 5 -10 4% albumin for resuscitation maintenance hydration: a. volume saline with KCl mmol/l or IA + inotrope + 50% dextrose): Wt(kg) 3 5 7 15 20 25 30 4 0 50 60 70 ml/hr 5 7 10 17 21 25 28 32 40 45 50 b. Maintain urine output >= 1.0 ml/kg/hr 3. Biochemistry a. Serum of 3% saline IV over 1hr; consider reduced water intake. b. Maintain blood glucose at 4 -10 mmol/L; use 50% dex trose 0.5 115 ml/kg/hr adjusted as required, or insulin 0.05 u/kg/hr adjusted as required. If BSL consistently >12, reduce IV sources of glucose and commence insulin. 4. Mean arterial pressure: a. Normovolaemia (CVP saline (not albumin ). b. Meticulously avoid hypotension and maintain CPP (see age specific targets below), particularly for the first 5 days. After this period a specific CPP aim is controversial. Use Noradrenaline 0.05 -0.5mcg/kg/min IV if required. c. Consider addition of adrenaline 0.05 -0.1 mcg/kg/min IV (especially if giving thiopentone IV or if cardiac echo demonstrates decreased ventricular function) E. ICP MONITORING (VIA INTRA -VENTRICULAR CATHETER or CODMAN CATHETER ) 1. Instituted for all patients who have: a. extensor or flexor posturing or flaccidity b. or a swollen brain at craniotomy c. or non -purposeful movements, posturing or flaccidity and requi re a prolonged surgical procedure e .g. laparotomy or orthopaedic procedure. If ICP is elevated, a catheter placed in the lateral ventricle is much preferred to a Codman monitor (which does not allow for removal of CSF). Decompressive craniectomy with duraplasty is associated with lower ICP but more severe disability in survivors. Its utility is restricted to evacuation of haematoma where bone cannot be returned. 2. General principles of management: a. The arterial pressure transducer and ICP transducer are zeroed at the level of the external acoustic meatus to allow ICP and CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure) to be measured from the same baseline. b. Venting of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is regulated by the height of attachment of the d rainage burette (at the level of the drip point) above the level of the external acoustic meatus. For example, to lower the ICP to 15mmHg pressure whenever the ICP is over 20mmHg, the height of the burette above the external acoustic meatus = 15mmHg x 1.36 = 20.4cm, so the top of the burette (at the level of the drip point) is secured 20cm above the external acoustic meatus to drain at 15mmHg. c. When continuously venting, the ICP should only be measured after the venting has been turned off at the distal 3-way tap for at least 30 seconds. d. Daily culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): see Procedure Manual - Intracranial Pressure Monitoring. 116 3. Treatment of raised intracranial pressure. The primary objective is maintenance of an adequate cerebral perfus ion pressure (CPP) = mean arterial pressure - mean intracranial pressure. Adequate CPP is: Neonate: >30 mmHg 1 month month - 11 mo: >40 mmHg 1 year - 4 years - 9 mmHg for 30mmHg saline; and v - consider urgent CTB to rule out evolving haematoma/hydrocephalus which may be amenable to neurosurgical intervention. - after surgery, give full medical management (see below). If there is high ICP and a high CPP, there must be high blood press ure. Look for the cause of the high BP (eg pain , seizures ) and treat it; do NOT give antihypertensives. Avoid wide swings in blood pressure or CPP (low CPP is bad, but very high CPP can have adverse effects also). Aim for ICP 20 mmHg or less Medical management of elevations: i. Ensure adequate sedation and analgesia, para lysed, CO 2 35-40, serum Na 140 -150, temperature control. ii. Moderate hyperventilation via hand bagging only if there is cerebral herniation or an ICP >30 mmHg. Use either 20%). Precautions: ensure serum osmolality is no greater than 320 mOsm to prevent risk of renal failure, and do not give more than 3 doses of mannitol per 24 hours due to the risk of cerebral accumulation of mannitol and potentiation of cerebral oedema ; given in boluses of 2 -4mL/kg over 5 minutes. Repeat to maximum 2 -4mL/kg 6 hourly PRN. Hold 3% saline if severe hyperosmolar state develops (ie Na >150 ). Do not give boluses of hypotonic solutions to lower sodium. iii. Intermittently vent CSF for five minutes . 117 iv. Continuously vent CSF (inform neurosurgical team). v. Thiopentone. Avoid hypotension. Slow bolus dose o f 1mg/kg IV, repeated not more than 4 times if needed to control seizures or ICP, then 1 -5mg/kg/hr IV via central venous catheter. Total cummulative dose to achieve burst suppression may be up to 20 -40mg/kg). Level: 150 -200 ummol/L (x 0.24 = mcg/ml); Bioch emistry Department to be notified of request for thiopentone levels before blo od sampling . Based on the lack of evidence for ICP -directed management for more than the early part of ICU admission, there should consideration for ceasing all ICP -directed man agement after 7 - 10 days (including ICP monitoring). Ceasing ICP -directed management should be agreed by both ICU and neurosurgery. F. CERVICAL COLLAR AND USE OF SAND BAGS 1. Use sand bags beside the head and a cervical collar on all patients; remove them only on the written instruction of the consultant ne urosurgeon or consultant orthopod aedic surgeon . Immobilise with tape if transporting a para lysed child. Avoid compression of soft tissues and venous obstruction. 2. X-ray cerv ical spine: AP, lateral, peg (and right and left 30o oblique if unconscious or uncooperative). If X-rays normal in a child old enough to clinically assess : Aspen collar until conscious and cooperative, then remove collar and assess for pain, tenderness, mu scle spasm, or reduced movement: - if assessment normal (fully conscious, no neck pain, swelling, tende rness or muscle spasm, full range of movement) no further action - if assessment abnormal or the child is unable to be assessed because of young age , lack o f cooperation or encephalopathy: replace Aspen or Philadelphia collar, do an MRI to look at soft tissues and cord . If X-rays abnormal or will be unable to assess clinically : Philadelphia or Aspen collar, MRI (+/- CT). Avoid compression of soft tissues and venous obstruction. G. ANTIBIOTICS 1. Prophylactic cefazolin only for external compound skull fracture or if surgeons request prophylaxis for EVD. 2. Antibiotics are NOT routinely required for: a. children with a fractured base of skull opening into the nose, middle ear or paranasal sinus . Use high dose penicillin if concerns. b. children with a Codman pressure monitor. 3. Use high dose vancomycin (target level 20 -25) and 118 ceftazidime for suspected or confirmed ventriculitis (>1 WCC to every 500 RBC f rom EVD CSF). H. ANTICONVULSANTS 1. Evidence that prophylaxis reduces seizures . Prophylactic anticonvulsants should be ceased after 7 days unless there has been evidence of seizures . Levetiracetam provides equivalent seizure prophylaxis to phenytoin, with the added advantage of: reliable dosing without a requirement for levels; equivalent bioavailability given enterally with no requirement to stop feeds before or after administration ; fewer drug interactions; no derangement to LFTs. a. prophylaxis dose levetiracetam 10mg/kg (max 500mg) 12 hourly IV/oral. 2. Monitor for and document all suspected seizure activity. I. GI/NUTRITION 1. Early enteral feeds if possible, although may no t be well tolerated if temp maintained <36oC. If NG feeds poorly tolerated: reduce narcotics, and give IV erythromycin 3mg/kg 8H. 2. Recommended preparations for NG feeding (nil evidence of cows milk protein allergy): 1yr maintenance infant formula or EBM, 1-6 . Use (hyperosmolar) if high calorie intake required. 3. Naso -jejunal (NJ) feeding may succeed if NG feeding fails. Recommended preparations for NJ feed s are described in Nutrition. 4. If diarrhoea occurs, investigate cause before stopping feeds. 5. Patients deeply sedated for ICP management should be started on early aperients IV/oral daily) J. POSITIONING All patients should be: 1. Nursed head elevated 30o 2. Maintained with their head in a neutral position with all flexion, extension, lateral flexion, axial traction and rotation avoided during turning. 3. Log rolled from side to side every 2 -4 hours and maintained at a 45o angle. The patient's head and shoulders should be supported throughout the turn. 4. Cooling blankets under the trunk only, so that pressure relief is available to the head at all times. 5. Bed can be br oken once thoracolumbar spine and pelvis cleared. 119 K. SPECIFIC DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 1. CT or MRI of brain (+/- spine) at the time of admis sion, upon subsequent deterioration in neurological condition, sustained elevations of ICP and at the discretion of the intensivist or neurosurgeon. If doing an MRI brain, consider whether it will be possible to clear the c ervical spine clinically - if not do MRI cervical spine also. 2. SSEP (somatosensory evoked potentials ) 24-48 hr post injury if not brain dead but poor outcome seems likely. For accurate SSEP ensure : no focal lesion preventing the stimulus reaching the cortex, no subdural or extradual h aemorrhage preventing the cortical response being recorded, and no crani ectomy in the previous 24hr. Absent SSEPs should be repeated after 24hr. Bilaterally absent SSEPs in setting of severe global injury on CT or MRI, history of severe injury (low motor score at scene), and sustained high ICP indicates very poor outcome. 3. Monitoring of (1) jugular venous oxygen saturation or (2) brain oxygen partial pressure (using a Licox monitor) may improve the management of patients with traumatic brain injury. However, their role is uncertain and they are not used routinely at RCH. 120 HYPOXIC INJURY From drowning , cardiac arrest or SIDS , for example. Admit to ICU if there is impaired conscious state or lung disease. Do a chest X -ray, gas, electrolytes, creatinine, lipase, liver function tests, FBE, coagulation, group and hold. Consider ECG (check for prolonged QT syndrome) and EEG. Prognosis is de termined by multi -modal evaluation - history of event (including rhythm, first response CPR, number of doses of adrenaline needed to achieve return of spontaneous perfusing rhythm), objective clinical neurological signs (in absence of sedativ e or paralyzing drugs) , imaging (MRI) and electrical information (EEG, SSEPs). 1. Maintain airway, breathing and circulation at all times. 2. Pass a large NG tube and rem ove as much stomach contents as possible. 3. Intubate and ventilate if there is impaired conscious state or evidence of significant lung disease. Pre -oxygenate, use cricoid pressure, give thiopentone 1 -2 mg/kg (if circu lation stable), vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg IV, wait 2 minutes then intu- bate quickly. 4. Insert a femoral venous line, and use 0.9% saline to maintain a CVP of 7 -10 cm. Correct hypovolaemia if it occurs. If there is hypotension, get a cardiac echo to guide fluid and inotrope therapy - is the left atrium small (give more fluid) or large (restr ict fluid); is left ventricular contractility poor (increase inotropes) or too good (reduce inotropes). Correct hyponatraemia by maximum 0.5 mmol/L/hr with 3% saline ml/kg serum Na by 3 mmol/L). Give dobutamine (and noradrenaline if required). If there is persistent hypo tension, give hydrocortisone 1 mg/kg/dose 6H IV. glucose 3.5 -5.5 mmol/L (65 -100 mg/100 ml). If glucose is low, infuse 50% dextrose at 0.5 ml/kg/hr, adjusted as required. Hypoglycaemia is more dangerous in children t han in adults, and hyper glycaemia is less dangerous: if glucose is >10 mmol/L for over 12hr, consider giving insulin 0.025 u/kg/hr (1.25 u/kg in 50 ml at 1 ml/hr) and monitor glucose hourly. 6. There is limited evidence that hypothermia improves the outcome in children after in -hospital cardiac arrest, but some evidence of improved outcome for adults after out -of- hospital VF and in asphyxiated neonates. If it is used, hypothermia should be induced as soon as pos sible after the insult, preferably within 6 hr . 121 7. After near -drowning, give penicillin 50 mg/kg/dose 6 hourly IV for 5 days. If there is severe lung disease, consider urgent bronchoscopy. 8. Do not routinely give steroids or mannitol. 9. Do not insert an ICP catheter (unless traumatic brain injury is present as well). If the ICP is very high, the outlook is very poor, and there is no evidence that treatment of the ICP improves outcome. 10. Check carefully for seizure activity. At the very least, allow relaxants to wear off every 12 -24 hours to check for abnormal movements. However, non -convulsive seizure s are common and dangerous, and EEG monit oring is required to detect them. Treat seizures with levetiracetam (50mg/kg then 10mg/kg 8 hrly) or phenobarb itone (20 mg/kg IV over 30 min stat, then 10 mg/kg over 30 m in as required) or phenytoin (15 mg/kg IV over 1 hr); if required, add midazolam 1-4 mcg/kg/hr. 11. Use PD or haemofiltration early if there is oliguria for more than 24 -48 hours , or hyperkalaemia . 12. Be careful not to wean too quickly or too soon. A child who has had a severe hypoxic insult should be ventilated for at least 72 hr, and much longer periods may be needed. 13. After asystolic arrest caused by hypoxia, the prognosis is poor (but not necessarily hopeless) if the pupils remain fixed and dilated for more tha n 6 hours. A daily full neurological examination should be done, including the tests of brain - stem function (apart from the apn oeic oxygenation test). Lack of motor response to pain, or extensor response, bilateral lack of pupillary reflexes or lack of c orneal reflexes at 72 hours, in the absence of sedation are indicators of poor prognosis. However a multi -modal approach to prognosis should be taken ( history, clinical signs , MRI +/ - electrical) 14. Bilaterally absent somatosensory evoked potentials 24 hours or more after the event suggest a poor prognosis , repeat in further 24 hours if absent . EEG changes indicating a poor prognosis include status epilepticus (despite treatment), burst suppression, alpha coma , or an EEG that is non -reactive to patient stimulation in the absence of sedation . 15. An MRI scan done at 3 -5 days will identify the severity and extent of restricted diffusion, which indicates dysfunctional cell membranes seen in ischaemic neurones. 122 IMMUNE SUPPRESSIVE MONOCLONAL AND monoclonal antibod ies and other biologic immunomodulatory agents are increasingly used in complex patients in the ICU. They are used by many departments: Oncology, Rheumatology, Immunology, Nephrology, Gastroenterology, transplant services and Dermatology. These drugs have complex effects on the immune system, and many potential interactions and adverse effect s in critically ill patients. Before commenced of a biologic immunomodulatory agent have a case conference involving the bed -card unit, the unit wishing to prescribe the immune suppressive therapy, the ICU consultant and PICU pharmacist . Answers to the fo llowing questions w ill be clearly defined. DRUG PROPOSED TO BE USED Dose and duration DIAGNOSIS What is the diagnosis or condition being treated? What are the objective diagnostic criteria? What international criteria are being used to confirm diagnosis ? What further investigations are needed to be as sure as we can be about the diagnosis? INDICATION FOR DRUG What is the indication for a biologic immunomodulatory agent in this diagnosis? What is the evidence What other therapies (including less immune -suppressive) should be considered? OBJECTIVE THERAPEUTIC GOALS What are the objective therapeutic goals? These should be clearly stated, such as reduction in A -a gradient, improvement in renal or liver function , increase in platelet count, and resolution of haemolysis on blood film. There will usually be several objective metrics to assess the effect of any immune therapy, which when triangulated enable a valid assessment of whether the overall therapeutic goal is being achieved. LABORATORY MONITORING What laboratory monitoring is needed to assess the effects of the drug on the immune system? Specify the exact tests, and frequency TIME FRAME What is the time -frame for the expected therapeutic goals to be reached? SIDE EFFECTS AND DRUG INTERACTIONS 123 What are the common side effects of these drugs? How can these be mitigated? What are the possible interactions of these drugs in this child: interactions with other immune dysfunction the child may have interac tions with other drugs exacerbation of existing organ injury potential for systemic effects (neuro -myopathy, SIRS, nutrition) INFECTION PROPHYLAXIS What prophylaxis of infection is needed? OPT OUT CRITERIA What criteria will result in cessation of the im mune modulation therapy? Immune suppressive monoclonal antibody and other biologics require the approval of the Drug Usage Committee. A form outlining the answers to the above questions should be submitted to DUC as evidence of a case conference.

Monitor fluid balance and CVP (aim for 5 -8) and intervene early (frusemide early (grade 2 encephalopathy or NH 3>100). Use as large a catheter as possible and a large filter. For NH 3 >150 , use as high a blood flow rate and filtrate flow rate as possible No heparin in the prime Lactate -free replacement solution ; regional anticoagulation (heparin/protamine); avoid ACD as a failing liver will not handle a citrate load. INFECTION: mortality risk and a risk factor for cerebral oedema Culture blood, urine, tracheal aspirate daily; WBC count, I/T ratio and procalcitonin Empirical broad -spectrum antibiotics for patients from time of admission with encephalopathy grade 3, SIRS or renal failure Consider antifungal therapy in patients with new signs of sepsis after 5 days in PICU .

Less likely to be effective if >10 hours post overdose. 132 133 LONG -STAY PICU PATIENTS Chronically ill children now make up a high proportion of PICU bed days . Many long -stay patients have chronic neurological problems or chronic respiratory or cardiac needs. These include children with cerebral palsy, post op spinal surgery, neuromuscular disease, or other brain injury. Children who stay in PICU longer than 28 days make up about 1% of all ICU patients, but nearly 20% of bed days . Just over a quarter of long -stay patients (LOS >28 days) have a favourable outcome (normal, functionally normal or mild disability), while nearly 50% die. Patients with PICU LOS >7 days and with complex needs are supported by the ICU care manager to ensure consistency of communication and care. Each week there is a long -stay patient meeting. Some children have a long -term ICU consultant, whose role is to maintain consistency of management, be the person who generally has discussions with the family, sub -specialty units and the duty ICU consultant about overall management, but not in day-to-day medical management. Transition from PICU to ward Chronic r espiratory support Children requiring long -term invasive ventilation may be appropriate for transition to the ward. The Sugar -glider (General Medical) and other wards will provide nocturnal BiPAP, +/ - BiPAP with physiotherapy, or BiPAP when children are asleep during the day ( e.g. some children with neuromuscular disease). However the child must first be established on BiP AP in ICU and stable. CPAP or BiPAP can be initiated on the ward in a child who has an acute deterioration, but the child will then be managed in the PICU until stable. BiPAP or CPAP can also be given in the context of palliative care on the wards. Current ly Sugarglide r is the only ward outside PICU where children requiring invasive ventilation or CPAP via tracheostomy are accepted. All patients requiring invasive or non -invasive ventilation must be referred to the Respiratory Unit, who will then manage ventilation and weaning outside PICU . 134 There is a weekly ventilation meeting on Wednesday morning organized by the Respiratory Unit at which ward patients or those soon to be discharged from PICU requiring ventilation are discuss ed. Children who are on home oxygen or non -invasive respiratory support who are having surgical procedures should generally have a bed booked in ICU post -op, as they may have worse respiratory function after surgery. For some procedures where post-op resp iratory function is uncertain (such as spinal surgery, or after fundoplication where CPAP/ BiPAP may carry a risk) children with chronic respiratory requirements should return to ICU intubated, and weaning and extubation can be planned and occur after a pr oper assessment of analgesia and ventilation requirements. BiPAP / VPAP Children in PICU may be on BiPAP Vision (Philips), or their home BiPAP machine. Patients needing transition to the ward are put on the VPAP ( ResMed). Modes of operating CPAP : only for children who do not require tidal volume augmentation and do not retain CO 2, e.g. obstructive sleep apnoea Spontaneous mode: a child who needs augmentation of tidal volume, but who is able to trigger the device. The patient breathing in and out t riggers transition between IPAP and EPAP Spontaneous / Timed mode: a child who sometimes is unable to trigger the device, and is needing to rest the respiratory muscles Timed: a child who is unable to trigger the device, the breath rate, IPAP Min and IPAP Max are set IPAP Max time : the time set as the maximum time the flow generator will remain in IPAP before switching to EPAP. This should be no greater than 50% of the cycle length. IPAP Min time: the minimum time the flow generator will remain in IPAP before switching to EPAP (if the patients inspiration is too short, the IPAP will remain for the IPAP minimum time, before changing to EPAP. This should be no less than 0.3 seconds. Ventilator parameters to be set: EPAP pressure IPAP pressure Respiratory rate (only in timed or spontaneous/timed modes) : usually set 4-6 breaths below the patient's relaxed rate. Count the patients respirations for 60 seconds with the child breathing quietly , calculate the respiratory cycle length (60 / RR) seconds 135 Setting i nspiratory times: Maximum IPAP time (IPAP Max) rise time = respiratory cycle length / 2 Minimum IPAP time (IPAP Min) Weaning from BiPAP: generally allow children to have several short periods (30 -60min) off BiPAP, then progressively lengthen time off (1-2 hours x 3 per day, 2 -3 hours x 3 per day) . Continue night -time BiPAP until off for the whole day when awake. Consider tds Bi PAP with physio during the day if the patient requires night -time BiPAP Before discharge ensure patients have VPAP orders p rescribed, Respiratory Unit and physiotherapy referral s have been made and the ICU technologists are aware of impending transfer Other things to consider for long-term or chronic PICU patients: Weaning plan for sedation and analgesia All drugs orally where possible Activity, physiotherapy, wheelchair, communication tools , play Nutrition: regular weighing, head circumference, length , plot growth Providing optimal calories , see Nutrition section Consider risk of aspiration - feed upright Feed intoleranc e: if large gastric residual volumes, consider metaclopramide or Constipation: consider lactulose, movicol Routine s D levels (25-hydroxy vit D decreased; 1 -25 hydroxy vitamin D may be increased), Prevention: adequate amou nts and ratio (1.3 -1.7:1) of Ca and P intake with an adequate caloric (> 80 Kcal/kg/d) and nutritional (2.5-3 g/kg/d amino acid and 400 IU/d vitamin D); consider ceasing frusemide or changing to anti -calciuric diuretic, such as chlorthiazide; limit use of corticosteroids; encourage physiotherapy and activity , consider bisphosponates Rationalis e tests : reduc e frequency of x-rays, blood tests , have a weekly timetable Prevent anaemia: essential blood tests only, haematinics (iron and folic acid , darbepoietin if renal impairment ) 136 Immunizations, newborn screening PALLIATIVE CARE Palliative care is an important part of ICU care. This requires different things for different children and families, but the following are important: Effective communication , children with chronic illness generally have many sub -speciaty units caring for them . ICU Care Manager can coordinate meetings. Some of these children will we have a long -term ICU consultant who can can provide consistency in discussions with families. A documented treatment plan outline s the care that will be provided if there is deterioration . RCH has a Palliative Care service. Do not repeatedly ask families if their child is \"for full resuscitation\" , and do not tell families that living is \"not in the child's best interests\". This can be wearing and distressing for families. Discuss with the ICU and bed -card C onsultant . The person who is best to talk to the family is usually someone senior who knows the child and the family well, whom they trust. For more information about Palliative C are, see http://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Withholding_ or_Withdrawal_of_LifeSus taining_Treatment/ 137 MENINGITIS AND A child < 1yr old with meningitis or encephalitis should usually be admitted to ICU because of the potential for deterior ation or acute complications ; con tact the ICU consultant if you think a child < 1 yr does not need admission to ICU. Admit any child with coma, hypo tension, sodium <130 mmol/L, multiple convul sions or a convulsion lasting longer than 15 minutes. See also Men - ingococcal Sepsis, and Sepsis - Severe. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated if there is absent or non - purposeful response to squeezing the ear lobe hard (the child should push you away or seek a parent), or if the child has focal neurological signs. Do blood culture, FBE and I /T rati o, gas, U&E, glucose. 1. Antibiotics. Give cefotaxine 50 mg/kg/dose (max 3g) 6H IV. If <2 mo, also give penicillin and gentamicin. 2. Fluids. Avoid both hypovolaemia (and hypotension) and water overload (cerebral oed ema). Correct hypotension with 10 ml/kg bol uses of 0.9% saline, and consider inserting a femoral venous cannula to monitor CVP. Give maintenance fluid of Plasma -lyte 148 and 5% dextrose at 1 ml/kg/hr (less if there is hyponatraemia). 3. Monitor electrolytes and glucose 4 hourly for at least the first 24 hours. Hyponatraemia suggests water overload. 4. Usually give dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg 6H IV, but give hydro cortisone 1 mg/kg 6H IV instead if there is septic shock. In addition, give a single dose of methylpredniso lone 10 mg/kg or dexa meth asone 2mg/kg if this can be given before the first dose of antibiotics. 5. Intubation and ventilation. Do this early for even mild impairment of consciousness, con vulsions, focal neuro logical signs, acidosis or IV; mins then intubate quickly. 6. Do a CT or MRI of the brain in any child who is intubated. If there is any clinical or radiological evidence of raised intracranial pressure, the ICU consultant may consult neurosurgery about an intraventricular catheter (and early cerebral decompression if the pressure is high). 7. Treat repeated or prolonged convulsions with intubation , and a long-acting anticonvulsant - levetiracetam or phenobarbitone phenytoin (se e Convulsions) . If convulsions persist despit e a long -acting anticonvulsant , give midazolam infusion increased until controlled (range 1 up to 10 mcg/kg/min in refractory cases ) - see CONVULSIONS - STATUS . 8. The bedcard unit should report measure CK), enterovirus (look for papular lesions on paraneoplastic, toxic (alcohol, paracetamol, salicylate, tricyclic, and heavy metals), and septic encepahalopathy. Decision to do LP is based on clinical features not only on a CT. If clinical contraindications to an LP (above) are present, an urgent CT or MRI should be done to identify brain oedema, tight basal cisterns, mass lesions, abscess, empyema . A normal CT does not exclude intracranial hypertension. Investigations Should b e selective based on the clinical presentation, and staged according to treatment response and initial tests. CSF microscopy, Gram stain, bacterial culture , cell count and type, protein, glucose bands (non-specific indication of CSF inflammation) CSF Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies NPA for respiratory viruses , enterovirus PCR Throat and rectal swabs for enterovi rus PCR or antigen testing for enterovirus, sensitive than CT at de tecting early cerebral changes of viral encephalitis Treatment Supportive, antibiotics until bacterial meningitis excluded Acyclovir: 3 months - 12 years: 500mg/m2 8 hourly; >12 years 10mg/kg erythromycin if mycoplasma suspected; Immunotherapy (steroids, IVIg, plasma exchange for immune - mediated encephalopathy) 140 MENINGOCOCCAL SEPSIS See also Sepsis , and Meningitis . Do not do lumb ar punc ture if there is a strong suspicion of meningococcal disease (typical rash in an ill child). Do a blood culture, blood smear on slide for gram stain, throat swab (in trans port medium), 2ml blood in an EDTA (for with diff ratio, group, gas, Na, K, Cl, Ca, phosphate, creatinine, glucose and chest X -ray. 1. Children with meningococcal disease often need very large amou nts of fluid initially (and antibiotics may make the hypovolaemia worse). Give 10 -20 ml/kg boluses of saline; 60-100 ml/kg is often needed. For septic shock, see Sepsis - Severe. 2. If it can be given before the first dose of antibiotic, give methylprednisolo ne 10mg/kg. 3. Give hydrocortisone 1 mg/kg 8H IV. 4. Intubate early (eg more than 40 ml/kg fluid, BE < -10, progressive skin lesions); do not wait until very ill. Pre - oxygenate, use cricoid pressure, give ketamine 1-2mg/kg and fentanyl 2 -3mcg/kg slowly IV if cons cious and circulation stable, vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg, wait 2 minutes, and intubate quickly. 5. Give cefotaxime 50 mg/kg/dose (max 3g) 6H IV. 6. Give immunoglobulin 0.5 g/kg IV over 2 hours. 7. If oliguria >12 -24 hours, consider haemofiltration. 8. If there is purpura fulminans , give FFP 1 bag per 15 kg (about 15 ml/kg) every 8 hours, and heparin 20 u/kg stat then 10 u/kg/hr (unless the child is heparin ised for filtrat ion) 9. Because large volumes of FFP are often needed, g ive 50% dextrose inf usion if requ ired to maintain blood gluc at 4 -6 mmol/L. If glucose > 10 mmol/L, add insulin 0. 05 u/kg/hr. 10. Do urgent fasciotomy if compartment pressure >40 mmHg (or > DBP - 30 mmHg) in adult -sized . 11. Isolat e the child for 12hr after sta rting anti biotics. The risk to staff is very low after just a few hours of antibiotic treatment. 12. ICU staff rarely need to take prophylactic antibiotics. They are only needed if staff have had unprotected exposure to respiratory droplets (generated from c oughing or during airway management) within 24hr (and perhaps less) of the patient starting antibiotic treatment. 13. The bedcard unit should report to the Health Department, and arrange prophylaxis for contacts. 141 METABOLIC - HYPERAMMONAEMIA Contact the meta bolic consultant on call to discuss the management of these patients. Metabolic patients have individualised management pl ans and different thresholds for various treatment modalities. Below is a general guideline for treatment options at different ammonia thresholds. Enteral feeds should not be interrupted for even a short time without providing adequate intravenous energy Ammonia < 250 \u00b5mol/l Inform intensive care and metabolic consultants Enteral feeds (energivit 20%) preferred If enteral feeds are not tolerated or even temporarily interrupted give iv glucose (10%, 12%, 15%) and intralipids (20%) to prevent or enteral) after discussion with changes in conscious level; consider ICP monitoring. Monitor ammonia level hourly until downward trend is observed. Start haemofiltration if ammonia level is rising at a rate of >50 \u00b5mol/l per hour or fails to fall / stabilize within 3 hours Note that in states other than inborn errors of metabolism, such as liver failure, a serum ammonia >100 is neurotoxic and an indication for haemofiltration. Ammonia 250 - 400 \u00b5mol/l: Inform intensive care and metabolic consultants Enteral feeds (energivit 20%) preferred If enteral feeds are not tolerated or even temporarily interrupted give iv glucose (10%, 12%, 15%) and intralipids (20%) to prevent catabolism. Specific metabol ic medications (such as li sted above) to be given intravenously Prepare haemofiltration but do not start immediately Monitor for changes in conscious level; consider ICP monitoring. Monit or ammonia level hourly. Start haemofiltration if ammonia level is ri sing at a rate of >50 \u00b5mol/l per hour or fails to fall / stabilize within 3 hours Ammonia > 400 \u00b5mol/l: Inform intensive care and metaboli c consultants Enteral feeds (energivit 20%) preferred 142 If enteral feeds are not tolerated or even temporarily interrupted give IV glucose (10%, 12%, 15%) and intralipids (20%) to prevent catabolism. Start haemofiltration ASAP Specific metabolic medications (such as listed above) to be given intravenously Ammonia >1000 \u00b5 mol/l Inform intensive care and metabolic consultant Evaluate whether to start curative treatment or palliative care Consider the following and discuss with Metabolic Team 1. ICP monitoring 2. Lower threshold for haemofiltration in patients with organic acideamia or with hyperammonaemia of unknown cause Reference: Haberle et al.

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012; 7:32 http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/32 143 MET: MEDICAL EMERGENCY TEAM The aims of the MET service are to prevent unexpected cardio - respiratory arrest and to reduce unplanned admis sions to ICU. The MET is composed of an ICU doctor, ICU nurse, The ICU doctor is the team leader. Responsibilities of MET members. Attend immediately (as for cardio -respiratory arrest). ICU nurse will take MET Trolley. Equipment is on wards. Most calls are not arrests. Introduce yourself as the ICU doctor, find out who the other people are in the room, listen carefully to what ward staff say about the patient and the reasons for the call. Politely ask people who are not assisting to leave. Ensure the parents are informed about what is done. Liaise with ICU ANUM if patient requires ICU admission. Call the ICU consultant if assistance with disposition is required or extra medical personnel are required. For patients remaining on ward - ensure ward nurse and unit doctor have an agreed follow up plan. Assign MET modifications as required. Complete the MET navigator in the Electronic Medical Record. Please do not criticise or embarrass the staff who called MET - be supportive and take the opportunity to educate. Enquire why the MET was called for the purpose of resolving the issue. Encourage and commend staff for calling a MET Multiple METs can occur concurrently. Call the PICU fellow or consultant to arrange attendance to all METs See Escalation of Care procedure on the RCH intranet PICU MET will attend all calls to: North Building - Level 1 and above, including Kelpie and Banksia (level 1), Sugar Glider and Kookaburra (level 2), Rosella and Koala (level 3), Platypus and Cockatoo (level 4), Butterfly (level 5), the clinica l & service (silver) lifts and the helipad. East Building - Level 3 and above, including the Operating Theatres, Recovery Rooms, MRI Suite, Possum (level 3) and Laboratory Services (fourth floor). Standard MET call criteria VICTOR chart - vital signs in the purple zone 144 OR Any one or more of: 1. Parent, nurse or doctor worried about clinical state. 2. Airway threat. 3. Hypoxaemia: SpO 2 <90% in any FiO 2, or cyanotic heart disease and SpO 2 <60% in any FiO 2. 4. Severe respiratory distress, apnoea or cyanosis. outside range 100 -180 (<12mo), 90 (>12yr). 8. Acute change in neurological status or convulsion. 9. Cardiac or respiratory arrest. Some of the values for respiratory rate, heart rate and blood pressure are outside the normal ranges for age: th ey represent values that may indicate serious illness, and that require expert review. It is also important to look for worsening trends in vital signs and report these. If a child fulfils any of these criteria, the treating medical team and the MET servi ce are notified (via switch on 777). MET modifications MET criteria can only be modified under the following circumstances : 1. In a stable patient, where there is a clear underlying clinical reason for one variable existing outside the normal range . 2. Any crit eria can be modified b y no more than 20%. 3. Do not modify more than one criteria (this effectively puts a child outside the protection afforded by the MET service). 4. By a doctor of registrar level or above. 5. For a defined period of time (not more than 24 hours). 6. Inform the bedcard consultant of any modification 7. Inform the PICU outreach registrar 145 MYOCARDITIS 1. Initial investigations and treatment as for cardiomyopathy (qv). 2. Consider early administratio n 35 ml/kg of 16% solution ) IV over 16 hours. 2. The use of immunosupressive drugs is controversial. Therapies include prednisolone , prednisolone plus azathioprine , or cyclosporin patient dies of suspected myocarditis or cardiomyopathy A full PM is desirable, but it can be limited to biopsies. Tissue should be collected rapidly. Inform pathology. The autopsy (tissue) kit is in the core lab. Dry ice is on the 10th floor (call Security if out -of-hours). Cardiac + skeletal muscle: 1 piece of each in glutaralde hyde for EM (store at 4\u00baC); 1 piece of each in formalin or paraffin for histochemistry + microscopy; 2 x 0.5cm cubes of each (wrap in foil, place in screw cap tube, cover in dry ice, store at - 70\u00baC). Liver: 1 piece in glutaraldehyde for EM (store in 4\u00baC fridge); 2 cores or 2 cubes (wrap in foil, place in screw cap tube, cover in dry ice, store at -70\u00baC). Skin. 1 piece full-thickness (2 -3mm surface diameter) in tissue culture or viral medium. Store at 4\u00baC. Blood. 10ml in heparin tube for DNA tests.

Discuss any suspicion of non -accidental injury with the ICU consultant. The ICU and bedcard consultants will decide whether to refer the child to the on -call social worker and the Victorian Forensic Paediatric Medical Service (VFPMS). In Australia reporting of suspected child abuse is mandated by law. 2. The bedcard unit registrar is responsible for formally admitting the child , and a V FPMS paediatric consultant should see the child early and document injuries . However, ICU staff should carefully record any statements made to them by the family about the cause of the injuries. 3. Carefully examine the child all over, and record your find ings in the notes in words and diagrams. 4. Invest igations will usually include clotting studies (PT, PTT, fibrinogen, platelets), a skeletal survey (and often a bone scan when the child is well enough), ophthalomogy (to look for fundal haemorrhages - dilate the pupils with short not with long -acting cyclopentolate) . Contact VFPMS and the RCH photographer for clinical photo - graphs of any skin lesions or external physical injuries . 5. Remember that unlike accidental trauma, with a non - accidental injury you can never be sure of when it occurred, or the force that was applied, or whether there were multiple injuries over time, or whether the child suffered secondary injury (hypoxic, hypotensive) following the abuse. Therefore , the natural history is much less certain than with injuries where these things are known, and children with NAI may deteriorate unexpectedly. 148 NORMAL VALUES Blood and sweat Acid Enteral Nutrition Feed children in ICU enterally as soon as possible. Feed using 3 hourly boluses initially. Start with half the calculated feed volume and increase over the next 6 hours. Approximate daily energy requirements in PICU: Age KJ/Kg/Day 1-2 mth 353 - 441 3 mths 320 - 400 4-6 mths 281 - 348 7-9 mths 271 - 338 13-24 mths 275 - 345 2 yrs 278 - 346 3-6 yrs 193 - 234 7-10 yrs 152 - 181 11-14 yrs 122 - 141 15-18 yrs 109 - 118 Consider increasing energy provided in non -ventilated, burns, complex cardiac patient, chronic sepsis , prolonged ICU stay . Suggested rates for grading up continuous feeds Age Initiation Standard feed choices Weight Standard energy concentration Increased energy concentration <8kg Breast milk (280kJ/100ml) Standard formula tolerated : reduce narcotics, give erythromycin 3mg/kg 8H. Or insert a nasojejunal tube for continuous post-pyloric feeding. Do not give ranitidine routinely to ventilated patients. If enteral feeds cannot be given, give ranitidine to high risk patients (burns, trauma, shock, sepsis, renal failure, spinal cord lesion, 152 corticosteroids, coagulopathy). Give omeprazole if GI hge occurs. Parenteral Nutrition In a well nourished child give parenteral nutrition if enteral nutrition is not possible for: > 2 da ys in a neonate > 3 days in infants > 5 days in an older child Earlier PN carries higher risk of infection. Consider PN earlier i n malnutrition or weight loss >10% and it is not possible to feed enterally . Lipid solutions: ClinOleic if anticipated use <2 weeks SMOF if lo ng term use anticipated Start lipid at 0.5 -1g/kg/day (older children may need 1 -2g/kg/day) Contraindicated : fungal infection, thrombocytopenia, LFT, FBC Daily while PO PO bloods Interruptions to PN If parenteral nutrition has to be suddenly discontinued, infuse at least half the amount of glucose (in mg/kg/min ) to prevent hypoglycaemia (especially in infants). NO child should ever go to theatre on peripheral PN. The risk of unrecognized extravasation is very high. C hange to equivalent dextrose -electrolyte solution (mg/kg/min glucose) and notify anaesthetist. No child should go to theatre on central PN, except for short procedures and only if the anaesthetist is aware. Refeeding Syndrome At risk after >7 days fasting, malnourished, recent weight loss (>10% body weight), baseline low K, PO 4, Mg Manifests as low PO 4, K, Mg and thiamine deficiency . Observe for arrhythmias , weakness , 6 hrly initially and replace , give thiamine, reduce energy intake if PO 4 <0.6mmol/L.

Leucostasis is more common in AML at lower white cell counts as blast are larger and coagulopathy more severe. All treatment decisions in consultation with oncologist. Admit direc tly to ICU, such children should not be managed on the ward until they deteriorate, it is common that they will. Baseline CT head scan on admission if any neurological signs. Intubate early if the child has headache, is irritable, has oedema or bleeding o n CT scan, don't wait for neurological deterioration. Meticulous attention to correcting coagulation and thrombocytopenia. For all leukaemia with high white cell counts maintain platelets counts over 50,000. If any bleeding on CT scan correct coagulopath y and give Nova 7, keep platelets above 100,000. Give rasburicase early (0.2mg/kg DAILY for 5 days). Do not prescribe it as a PRN order, as second and subsequent doses may not be given (duration can always be reviewed). Use mannitol with pre -chemotherapy hyper -hydration. 500 ml Plasma -lyte 148 and mannitol 20g (100 ml of 20%). Run at 1.5 L per m2 per 24 hours. If the child is referred from a regional centre, transfer as soon as possible. If the chemotherapy is going to be delayed by transfer, consider Hydroxyurea for AML or corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) for ALL until transfer and initiation of chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy should be as intense as possible to reduce the WCC as rapidly as possible (Oncology will consider this on an individual basis) Monitor for tumour lysis syndrome (see below). For large mass disease lymphoma or high risk of tumour lysis syndrome Give rasburicase early (0.2mg/kg DAILY for 5 days). Do not prescribe it as a PRN order, as second and subsequent doses may not be g iven (duration can always be reviewed) 155 Use mannitol with pre -chemotherapy hyper -hydration (as above). Al kalinisation should be avoided when phosphate is elevated, as this can cause calcium phosphate to precipitate. With rasbusricase the problem of hyperu ricemia is rare. Monitor potassium, uric acid, calcium, phosphate, creatinine, and urea. Do not give calcium unless symptomatic (risk of calcium phosphate deposition). Treat hyperkaelaemia according to guideline (see Cardiac - post-op and hyperkalaemia ) Consider haemofiltration if electrolyte abnormalities, progressive fluid overload or oliguria refractory to treatment. 156 OXYGEN GRAPHS 157 OXYGEN THERAPY In bronchiolitis administer oxygen when SpO 2 <90%. For critically ill children with multiple organ dysfunction or potential deficits in oxygen delivery, administer oxygen to maintain SpO 2 >94%. Wean oxygen therapy if SpO 2 >97%. Humidify oxygen if flow rates > 2 litres/min in infant, or >4 litres/min in an older child. Always humidify oxygen therapy given through a tracheostomy, nasopoharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube . If giving oxygen via face mask have flow rates >5 L/min to avoid re -breathing CO 2. Avoid h yperoxaemia, which can exacerbate ARDS - aim for FiO 2<0.6 in an intubated patient (use PEEP and other strategies to improve SpO 2 in order to reduce FiO 2<0.6. Before giving oxygen to children with cyanotic congenital heart disease, find out what their usual SpO 2 is when they are well. Beware of giving oxygen to infants with balanced circulations (univentricular hearts) or large VSDs (which can increase shunt and worsen pulmonary congestion. Aim for SpO 2 within their usual range (in balanced circulation usually 75-85%); for VSD with lung disease (such as bronchiolitis) SpO 2 88-92% is adequate . In very pre -term infants (<32 weeks GA) maintain SpO 2>88% but no t greater than 95%. Use the Respiratory Distress S core (below) to monitor patients on oxygen therapy: If RDS>8 consider the need for higher level of support (e.g. High flow or CPAP), refer to ICU registrar, fellow or consultant. 158 OXYGEN - HIGH FLOW NASAL CANNULA Humidified high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HHFNC) used for the same indications as the traditional method of CPAP using a nasopharyngeal tube: Severe respiratory distress from bronchiolitis, pneumoni a, asthma, congestive heart failure hypoxaemia (SpO2 yr; 4 L/min older children) respiratory support post extubation and mechanical ventilation weaning therapy from mask CPAP or BIPAP respiratory support to children with neuromuscular dise ase apnoea of prematurity Equipment Oxygen and air source, blender Flow meter <10Kg use standard 0 -15L/min flow meter >10Kg use flow meter which delivers up to 100L/min flow (available from clinical technologists) Humidifier (Fisher and Paykel\u00ae MR850) Circuit tubing to attach to humidifier Children <10kg: small volume circuit tubing (RT 329) Children >10kg: adult oxygen therapy circuit tubing (RT203) Nasal cannula (prongs) to attach to humidifier circuit tubing Newborn, full term: Infant cannula BC2745 or BC 2755 (size to fit nares comfortably) Infants and children up 10kg: Paediatric cannula Children Secure nasal cannula on patient using Comfeel and tape, ensuring the prong s sit well into the nares. Start the high flow nasal cannula system at the following settings: Flow rate s: 2 L/kg/min for the first 10kg: i.e. 6 kg child = 12 L/min; 8kg=16L/min; 10kg child = 20 L/min 0.5 L/kg/min for each kg above that (max 50 L/min) : 16kg child will receive 20+3 = 23 gives 4 -8 cmH2O PEEP . For <10kg start at target flow, fo r >10kg start at 6L/min and increase up to target flow rate over a few minutes to allow patient to adjust to high flow 159 FiO 2: Always use a blender , never use flow meter off wall delivering FiO 2 100% . Start at 50 -60% for bronchiolitis and respiratory distress Lower FiO 2 (e.g. 21% - 25%) may be needed for cyanotic congenital heart disease with balanced circulation Target range for SpO 2 of 93%-98%, use lowest FiO 2 to achieve this 75-85% in cyanotic congenital heart disease with balanced circulation Humidification : Because flows used are high, heated water humidification is needed. Set humidifier on 37 C invasive setting Most children have an NG tube Monitor HR, RR, SpO2, work of breathing (use Respiratory Distress Score , below) . If within 2 hours SpO 2>90%, HR and RR by 20% or both to normal range for age escalation of respiratory support - e.g. to CPAP or intubation is unlikely to be needed. If RDS> 8 consider the need for higher level of support , refer to ICU fellow or consultant 160 Use the respiratory distress score for monitoring patients on HFNC and Oxygen therapy RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SCORE Hypoxaemia Chest wall retraction Respiratory sounds (Audible) Respiratory sounds (Auscultated) Respirat ory rate / min ** Heart rate / min ** Mild =1 Mild hypoxaemia SpO 2 90-93% None or minimal None or minimal external sounds Good air extry on auscultation, some wheeze chest wall retraction Intermittent grunting and/or nasal flaring Moderately reduced air entry. Wheeze and some crepitation on auscultation 40-60 140-170 Severe =3 hypoxaemia <85% Marked chest wall retractions, tracheal tug Grunting with every breath, or audible wheeze, nasal flaring Widespread crepitations. Poor air entry on auscultation >60 >170 Score / 18 Note that on high flow if high FiO 2 is used, oxygen saturation may be maintained in an infant despite the development of hypercarbic respiratory failure. FiO2 adjustment and weaning Wean FiO 2 but do not wean flow rate until need for PEEP support resolved For infants <10Kg First step is to wean the FiO 2 to <40% (usually within the first 1 -2 hours) Once respiratory distress improved, c hange to standard low flow 100% oxygen (1 to 2 L/min) or cease oxygen therapy For children >10Kg Wean FiO 2 to 40 % (usually within the first 1 -2 hours) 161 Once the indication for using high flow has resolved, and the patient is stable in 40% oxygen, change to standard flow 1 -2 L/min (up to 4L/min for older children) with FiO 2 of 100% via st andard nasal prong therapy, or mask oxygen if preferred . There is no need for a prolonged weaning process, either be on humidified high flow, or standard low flow. 162 PERTUSSIS Pertussis (whoopi ng cough) usually presents as episodes of severe, prolonged coughing, but may present as apnoea in young infants. A whoop (loud stridor on inspiration after a paroxysm) is rare in children <6 mo old. Patients often appear well between paroxysms; persistent respiratory dis tress suggests that there is pneumonia. Mortality is highest in very young infants, and with a white cell count >100,000 (especially neutrophils >50,000). Diagnosis is by immunofluorescence or PCR of nasophayngeal aspirate. Severe illness may be associat ed with circulatory failure (from pulmonary hypertension), respiratory failure (often pneumonia), and encephalopathy with coma or convul sions (probably from hypoxic -ischaemic injury). 1. Give clarithromycin 7.5 mg/kg/dose 12H for 7 days oral or NG. If parenteral treatment is required, give azithro mycin 15 mg/kg (max 500 mg) IV day 1, then 5 mg/ kg (max 200 mg) daily for 7 days. Treat contacts if they are not fully immunised and either <12 mo old, or chronic cardio -respiratory illness, or in last month of pregnancy. 2. Oxygen therapy is often indicated even though the child is well oxygenated b etween paroxysms; pre -oxygenation reduces cyanosis during paroxysms of coughing. 3. There are copious thick secretions, and effective suctioning is very import ant (particularly after intubation). 4. In severe disease, consider giving methylprednisolone. 5. Humidified high flow or Nasal CPAP may be helpful for apnoea (but may stimulate coughing paroxysms) . 6. Pulmonary hypertension may cause severe circulatory or respiratory failure; it may be caused by leukocyte aggregates in pulmonary vessels. If there is leukocytosis (especially neutrophilia) with pulmonary hypertension, con sider urgent exchange transfusion or apheresis to remove white cells. For pulmonary hypert ension , consider nitric oxide and sildenafil. 7. In very severe disease, ECMO should be considered providing there is not severe hypoxic -ischaemic injury. However, mortality rates are high, especially in infants <6 weeks old. 8. Hypotension may respond to vasopressin 1 u/kg in 50ml given at 0.5 -2 ml/hour. 163 PETS The Victorian Paediatric Emergency Transport Service (PETS) offers retrieval of critically ill children in Victoria, southern NSW and Tasmania, and advice about their manage ment. The service is amalgamated with PIPER, to be the Paediatric Infant Perinatal Emergency Retrieval service. Managing PIPER Referral Calls PIPER calls should be taken by the PETS consultant when available , or the most senior registrar or fellow when not available. All PIPER calls are answered and scribed by a Clinical Coordinator in PIPER. You will receive a page directing you to call into a conference room. If you take the PIPER call, you should state your name and role (eg ICU registrar). Use the 'PETS Activity Activity Notepad' as a guide. Obtain essential details (name, age, hosp ital, refer ring doctor's name and contact telephone number), provis ional diagnosis, current condition, treatment and response to treatment... At the finish of the phone conversation, ask the referring doctor to speak directly with the receiving bedcard r egistrar (eg general paeds, or general surgery) if they have not already done so. If the PETS consultant is not immediately available: listen to the referring doctor's concern s; offer advice on manage ment; advise on preparations for transfer (see below); arrange to transfer the child if required; ring back wit h your ETA at the referring hospital (for very unstable children, ring back yourself in 15 -30 minutes, or get another experienced ICU doctor to do so). Always be polite, diplomatic and never condesc ending. Double -check the name of the town and the name of the hospital. The most appropriate doctor should perform retrievals. For example, a child with a difficult airway should always be retrieved by a senior ICU registrar or a consultan Only the PETS consultant may decide that we are not able to perform a requested transport. The consultant should discuss the best method of transferring the child with the referring doctor. Prioritisation . There are certain conditions for which the PETS team should be mo bilized immediately, these are referred to as the Go Now criteria. The team deployed may need to be a second team if the PETS team are already out. The criteria are: PETS GO NOW CRITERIA Lactate >6 mmol/L or pH <7.0 Upper airway obstruction persistent despite >2 doses of adrenaline, or hypoxic (SpO2<90%) Pneumonia with hypoxaemia (SpO2 <90%) despite locally 164 available non -invasive respiratory support Sepsis or shock requiring intubation Sepsis or shock despite >40ml/kg fluid Large pleural eff usion (e.g. near white -out of hemi -thorax) Ongoing seizures despite 2 doses of midazolam and loading with a long acting agent (phenytoin, levetiracetam, phenobarbitone) Signs of raised intracranial pressure than flexion motor res ponse Any arrhythmia with haemodynamic compromise (shock, hypotension, signs of heart failure) Any child with suspected systemic to pulmonary shunt who is about to be intubated or needing inotropes Any child with suspected cardiomyopathy / myocarditis who is about to be intubated or needing inotropes Cardiac or respiratory arrest Serum ammonia >200 mcg/dL ECLS retrievals must always be co -ordinated by the PETS and ECLS consultant. They require an ECLS PIPER nurse, senior ICU doctor, cardiac surgeon and perfusionist. They take up to 16hr, so are a significant resource consideration. All interstate ECLS retrievals must first be ratified by the exec on -call for RCH. Advising referring hospital staff Secure the Airway, Breathing and Circulation. Intubate if necessary (nasal tube if appropriate); check ETT position on chest x -ray (tip at medial end of clavicles); strap ETT securely; and frequent ETT suction; NG tube; adequate plasma expansion; guide lines on when to start inotrope infusion; check blood glucose and give dextrose if necessary; stop fits; continue ventilating any child after cardiac arrest even if they appear to be breath ing adequately; maintain body temperature ; urine catheter if neces sary; check electrolytes if appropriate; splint arms. Doctor's letter to RCH; copy of observation chart and drug chart if pos sible; copy of x-rays if possible; ring RCH ICU if there is a problem before the PETS team arrives. Mode of transport All transpo rt is organised through PIPER: 1300 659 803 (Non Emergency calls), 1300 137 650 (Emergency calls) Metro - Non-urgent: PIPER vehicle or taxi Urgent: Ambulance City Fringe & rural <150km - Non-urgent: PIPER vehicle or taxi Urgent: Helicopet 165 Rural >150km: Fixed Wing Equipment to take Complete a checklist (found in the PIPER Equipment room) for every retrieval .

Unless inappropriate to do so (resuscitation), perform a 'huddle' between PIPER team and local team to discuss the expected plan and who will do what in case of expected or unexpected d eterioration. Do not initiate discussion about th ings you consider to be mistakes in management (on return to RCH, 167 discuss these with the ICU consultant, who will arrange feedback later). If you are asked to com ment, be diplomatic and consider the stress under which referring staff have been working. Us e local expertise if appropriate. For example, a local anaes thetist may be more exper ienced at intubation than you. Explain any changes in treatment you feel are needed before departure (eg changing oral to nasal t ube). Ask the referring hospital staff to help in the preparations for depar ture. Use referring hospital consumables when appropriate. Go carefully through the pre -departure checklist on the retrieval form. Make sure the patient and equipment are stabilised before departure. Contact the ICU Consultant and receiving Consultant before departure. Check: water in ET tube cuff; avoid air splints; pneumo thorax drained; adequate supplies of drugs, IV fluids, oxygen and batteries. Thank the referring staff, and ring them on arrival. Ensure the pat ient, all lines, equipment, bags and staff are secured in the vehicle. At least one parent should be carried in the transport vehicle whenever possible - ask driver/pilot. Briefl y discuss the child's illness and the retrieval and management plan. Mention a ny problems anticipated during retrieval. Tell the parents how to find RCH /Monash Give them the receiving hospital information handouts. Analgesia and sedation during transport Upper respiratory tract obstruction . Splint the arms securely; secure the ETT to with adequate strapping; ensure adequate ETT humidifica tion and suction; NG chloral or IV midazolam if all other measures fail to reduce the risk of self -extubation. Asthma, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, ARDS. If not ventila ted, do not sedate during tran sfer: it suppresses respirat ory drive and precipitates respiratory failure. If ventilated (not just CPAP or NCPAP), adequate anal gesia and sedation (with or IV midazolam) should be given. Muscle relaxant drugs are usually used during transpor t in these circumstances. Conditions with raised intracranial pressure (head injury, meningitis, blocked VP shunt, tumour, intracranial haemor - rhage). Unless they are ventilated, these children should not be sedated - sedation depresses conscious ness, obscuring the main sign of progression of the intra cranial hypertension, and suppresses the respiratory drive (raising PaCO 2 and ICP). If they are paralysed and ventilated, use morphine infusion or boluses of morphine (0.01 -0.05 mg/kg/hr) to prevent incre ases in ICP caused by pain or distress. Midazolam 1 -2 mcg/kg/min may be given IV if necessary unless neuro logical assessment 168 will be needed in the next 2 -4 hours. If the PIPER team believes that a patient with raised ICP should be sed ated before or durin g transport, this should be discussed with the ICU consultant on call. Trauma. Children without head injury may be given a morphine infusion or small IV boluses of morphine (0.025 mg/kg) repeated as necessary up to 0.15 mg/kg per 4 hours. Children with a head injury and painful fractures or other painful injuries may require doses of morphine large enough to suppress spontaneous venti lation, and may require IPPV to allow adequate anal gesia without secondary brain injury. Beware using intercostal nerve b locks before travel in aircraft (risk of pneumothorax). Miscellaneous disorders (eg septic shock). Unless the child is clearly in pain or agitat ed, sedative or analgesic drugs should not be given as they may cause hypotension or impaired car diac output d uring transport when observation and monitoring are difficult. If analgesia is required, consider giving ketamine by infusion (1 mg/kg/hr) or repeated IV boluses (0.5 -1 mg/kg every 30 minutes). Otherwise, give small IV boluses of fentanyl (eg 0.2 mcg/kg) o r morphine (0.025 mg/kg) repeated as necessary, allowing at least 2 minutes between doses to assess the effect of the drug on blood pressure and circulation. Repeated small doses of midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg may be given, especially if ketamine is used (beware reduction of blood pressure and cardiac output). Retrieval Paperwork Complete and thourough documentation must be completed for every retrieval. 15 min observations; note all drugs and fluids given, any changes in the child's c ondition, any problems occurring at the referring hospital and during transfer, times of arrival and departure. Whenever possible, leave a photocopy of the P IPER notes (up to departure) you have made with the referring hospital just prior to departure. On return to RCH Notify the receiving medical or surgical unit immediately. Discuss the child with the ICU consultant. Contact the referring hospital staff and let them know the child's condition on arrival and the management plan. Replace any items used fro m the P IPER bagsClean the equipment and charge the monitor, ventilator, and syringe pumps. 169 PIM SCORE The paediatric index of mortalit y (PIM2) is a statistical model that predicts the number of children who die after admission to intensive care. PIM can be used to assess quality of care in individual PICUs, and compare different ways of organising intensive care. PIM can also be used to assess risk -of-mortality in groups of child ren with a specific disease, but is not ideal for this purpose. To assess the quality of care in an ICU, we use the stan dardized mortality rate (SMR). The SMR is obtained by dividing the number of patients who actually died by the number of deaths predicted by PIM . An SMR SMR >1.0 sug gests poor quality care (but the variation from 1.0 may well be due to chance if the 95% CI of the SMR includes 1.0). The SMR compares the actual number of deaths in the ICU with an estimate of the number of deaths that would have occurred if the same patients had been looked after in the units that derived the score (at the time the score was derived). Before using the SMR results, check the performance of PIM in the ICU being assessed by using the area under the ROC plot - an area over 0.7 suggests that PIM is probably an approp riate model. PIM (and PRISM) are designed to be used to describe groups of patients, not individual patients. They should never be used to decide that an individual patient is too sick to treat, or not sick enough to need intensive care. It is important that the infor mation used to calc ulate PIM is accurate - so it has to be collected very care fully. Data from a random sample of 20 -50 patients should be collected in duplicate annually. At least 50 deaths are needed to obtain a reliable estimate of the SMR. To allow for valid comparison , report results for a standard age range (such as 1 mo to 15 yr inclusive), and for ventilated and unventilated children. It is also important that paed iatric intensivists obtain population -based information about children from defined regions who receive inten sive care , and those who die without receiving intensive care . 170 PNEUMONIA Indications for ICU admission: hypoxaemia (SpO 2<90%) or severe respiratory distress despite oxygen therapy sepsis with hypotension or need for 40m l/kg bolus of fluid large effusion (e.g. near a hemi -thorax or culture, procalcitonin, FBE. Distinguish pneumonia (lung consolidation, small lung volumes) from bronchiolitis (gas trapping, prol onged expiratory phase, large lung volumes). If clinical / radiographic picture of bronchiolitis: antibiotics only if toxic, very unwell, Pct >2, IT ratio >0.2 or high fever (>39 C). Antibiotics for pneumonia : benzylpenicillin and gentamicin are first-line therapy, except if you suspect Staph infection (flucloxacillin) or atypical (azithromycin), or hospital -acquired (see - Acquired). If empyema , give ceftriaxone, flucloxacillin and clindamycin (see below). Give oxgen by mask or nasal pr ongs If persistent respiratory distress give humidified high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy or nasal CPAP. Restrict fluids. If needing IV fluids give no more than 50% of normal maintenance requirements in the first 24 hours IV, unless dehydrated or hypovolaemic. Enteral feeding if possible. Intubate if severe respiratory distress or persisting hypoxaemia despite HFNC or non -invasive respiratory support (CPAP / BiPAP), or severe sepsis and hypoxaemia. Notify ICU consultant if need to intubate any ch ild with pneumonia Assess cardiac function Be prepared for deterioration in oxygenation (de -recruitment with induction) Beware of Stabilise with oral intubation first, -recruit, suction, then change t o nasal, insert NGT Beware ETT obstruction with secretions Chest x -ray to check ETT & NG position, no PTX 171 Sedation with morphine / midazolam, as per sedation guidelines Often after intubation of a child with pneumonia there is respiratory or cardiovascula r instability. This can be mitigated by maintaining lung inflation with during induction, avoiding derecruitment, suctioning ETT early and gentle recruitment with long inflations, avoiding overinflation which will reduce venous return, pre -induction low d ose vasopressor or inotrope if hypotension or poor perfusion. Decide if there is a component of airflow obstruction (such as in viral pneumonia) that may need a different ventilation strategy. Ventilation PIP<30 PEEP 8 - 10 FiO2 <0.6 I-time 1 sec Ensure adequate expiration (no gas trapping) Paralysis or HFOV if these parameters cannot be achieved, with PaO 2>60, pCO 2 50-70 and pH >7.2 Do echo if signs of heart failure (tachycardia, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly) or murmur, measure lactate and SvO 2 Do a BAL in any child intubated with pneumonia. Drainage of effusion / empyema (see below) Consider V -V ECMO for refractory hypoxaemia despite HFOV 172 PNEUMONIA - EMPYEMA Do not delay draining a large effusion in a child who has significant cardiac or respira tory compromise. Do an ultrasound scan to confirm presence of effusion, look for septation, fibrin strands that suggest complex empyema, underlying lung for evidence of haemorrhagic change, abscess or necrotizing pneumonia. Intubation of a child with large empyema often leads to severe deterioration. If evidence of cardiorespiratory compromise, drain the effusion early. Many children stabilise after primary drainage and avoid ventilation. On PETS retrieval, drain effusion in any unstable child with severe pneumonia prior to transport. Chest drain: pigtail catheter if simple effusion, or if complex effusion: chest drain using blunt dissection. Send pleural fluid for Gram stain, culture, pneumococcal PCR, + cefotaxime + c lindamycin) +/- VATS in theatre either primarily or if no improvement after 48 hours of effective antibiotics. Consider Urokinase if no improvement, but only do if no coagulopathy, and no evidence of haemorrhagic lung underlying empyema (do a CT if needed to identify this). Urokinase - 40,000 units in 40 mL 0.9 percent saline for children one year and older, and 10,000 units in 10 mL 0.9 percent saline for children younger than one year. This dose should be administered twice daily (with a four -hour dwell time) for three days only. Additional doses may be considered if the response is incomplete after six doses of Urokinase, but only if no bleeding complications or coagulopathy. Intrapleural bupivacaine (0.5 to 1.0 mL/kg of a 0.25 percent solution) can be a dministered with urokinase if the child finds it uncomfortable. If no improvement, do a CT, consider resistant organisms, TB, discuss with surgeons regarding thoracotomy. 173 PNEUMONIA / ARDS IMMUN OCOMPROMISED HOST Diagnostic possibilities include bacterial (primary or VAP), viral, fungal, oedema (fluid overload or cardiogenic), immune, transfusion or chemotherapy related, baro -trauma, thrombo - embolic. Many cases of ARDS in immunocompromised children are multifactorial. Investigate early, to avoid p olypharmacy. Fluid overload and cardiac causes (cardiomyopathy, tamponade) may mimic ARDS Risk factors for fungal and PjP include prolonged corticosteroid therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, prolonged neutropenia, and lymphopenia. Do BAL, CT and consider lung biopsy early. Investigations: BAL bacterial Gram stain and culture, fungal wet prep and culture. Viral PCR: fluid suspect fungal infection: as above, plus fundoscopy, microscopy and culture non-infective causes: Fluid overload Transfusion related lung injury Tumour infiltrate BA L) Pulmonary (wide spectrum, to severe bronchiolitis obliterans in chronic GVHD) Chemotherapy induced lung injury (alkylating ag ents, antimetabolites, bleomycin, others). Can cause various lung pathologies: diffuse alveolar damage, bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) or Lung biopsy 175 POISONING The severity of poisoning depends on the toxicity of the substance, its formulation, the quantity, and the time since exposure. These notes refer only to potentially serious cases. Information about poisoning can be obtained from the ICU consultant, the Poisons Information Centr e (phone 131126) and from Poisindex (www. clinicians.vic.gov.au/electlib.htm and click on Micromedex then Toxicology). 1. Ipecac use is controversial, even if it is given within 1 hour of ingestion - so it is very rarely indicated in ICU. 2. Gastric lavage removes less than half of most substances even if performed promptly. Lavage should be discussed with the ICU consultant for potentially serious cases within 2 hours of ingestion (or longer if the drug impairs g astric emptying); it is contraindicated for corrosives, hydrocarbons and petrochemicals. Children who are not fully alert should be intubated before lavage (but note that intubation does not guarantee that aspiration will not occur). Lay the child on the side, head down. Use a single -lumen 24 -32 French orogastric tube, and check position carefully (return of gastric contents and auscultate air injected into stomach). Instill 10 ml/kg aliquots of saline and then aspirate; repeat until the aspirate is clear (several litres may be required). 3. Several specific adsorbants are used: Fuller's earth (for paraquat), potassium ferrocyanate (for thallium), milk (for fluoride), sodium polystyrene sulfonate (for lithium), and cholestyramine (for lindane). 4. Activate d charcoal adsorbs many poisons, but not common electrolytes, iron, mineral acids and bases, alcohols, cyanide, most solvents, hydrocarbons, pesti cides, or lithium. It is most effective in the first hour after ingestion, wit h little benefit from a single dose of charcoal after 2 -4 hours. Charcoal causes severe lung damage if aspirated. Children who are not fully alert should be intubated (but this does not guarantee pro - tection against aspir ation). Check that bowel sounds are present, pass an NG tube (minimum size 10 FG), check the position carefully (preferably by X -ray), empty the stomach as much as possible. Lie the child on the side, give charcoal 1 g/kg via NG tube, then (if slow -release preparation ingested) give 0.2 5 g/kg hourly. If multiple doses of charcoal are given, also give sorbitol 1 g/kg (1.4 ml/kg of 70%) NG repeated after 5. Whole -bowel irrigation (with polyethylene glycol and electrolytes) is reserved for use in (a) d elayed presen tation after ingestion of slow -release preparations, or (b) substances 176 not adsorbed by charcoal (eg iron). Eucalyptus and essential oils Cause coughing, vomiting and aspiration pneumonia. Coma usually occurs within 30-60 min, but may be delayed. Do not use lavage, charcoal or bowel irrigation. Iron Take chest and abdominal X -rays (may see tablets). Charcoal is useless. Gastric lavage <2 hr. Whole bowel irrigation if no ileus, obstruction or erosion. Give desferrioxamine 10 mg/kg/hr for 12 - 24 hr (max 6g/24 hr) if serum iron >60 -90 umol/L at 4 hr or 8 hr (x 5.59 = ug/dl). Paracetamol Discuss gastric lavage with the ICU consultant if it can be performed within 2 hours of ingestion. Give activated char coal. Give acetylcysteine if plasma paracetamol >1000 umol/L at 4 hr, 500 at 8 hr, 200 at 12 hr, 80 at 16 hr or 40 at 20 hr (x 0.15 = ug/ml); give even if presentation is delayed: 150 mg/kg over 1 hour, then 10 mg/ kg/hr IV. Monitor liver function tests and potassium. Paraquat >30 mg/kg severe toxicity, >50 mg/kg usually fatal: O 2 free radicals cause multi -organ failure over several days. Immediate charcoal 1g/kg NG, haemofiltration or charcoal haemoperfusion (within 2hr if possible), add N 2 so sats 70 -80% V -V level >25 mmol/L (x 13.8 = Monitor glucose, K, pH. Theophylline Consider gastric lavage (<2 hr), activated charcoal, or whole - bowel irrigation (delayed presentation of slow -release form). Consider pla smafiltration with levels over 500 umol/L. Metoclo - pramide for severe vomiting. Monitor ECG and potassium (low early, high later). Tricyclic antidepressants Monitor ECG (rate, QRS, QT). Adjust pH to 7.45 -7.50 with bicarbonate or or both. phenytoin arrhythmia). Noradrenaline for hypo (avoid beta agonists). DC shock then amio darone up to 5 mg/kg or beta blocker for VT, VF. For torsade, give mag - nesium 0.1-0.2 mmol/kg (0.05 trying 3 ml/kg of 3% saline slowly IV for severe arrhythmias or CNS toxicity. Monitor ECG in ICU until 12 -lead ECG shows normal duration of QRS at normal pH (7.35 -7.45). 178 PROCALCITONIN Measure PCT in patients where temperature or IT ratio are unreliable, or high risk of sepsis: ECMO Haemofiltration Burns Traumatic brain injury Induced hypothermia Post-cardiopulmonary bypass Immunocompromised Measure PCT if you are prepared to change management based on the result, i.e. if you will withhold, cease or scale back antibiotics if the result is <2ng/ml. If PCT >2 ng/ml consider antibiotics according to PICU Antibiotic Protocol. If the PCT is substantially rising (such as from 0.5 to 1.8 ng/ ml over 24 hours) and there are other signs of sepsis, also consider antibiotics according to PICU Antibiotic Protocol. The higher the PCT gets, the more likely bacterial sepsis, and the more strongly antibiotics are recommended. For example a PCT of >5 n g/ml mandates antibiotics. Measure PCT in a child with fever T>38 C, if there are no absolute indications for antibiotics: If <2 ng/ml consider to withhold, cease or scale back antibiotics. If >2 ng/ml consider antibiotics according to PICU Antibiotic Protocol. PCT should be measured no more frequently than 24 hours. Key facts No marker of infection can rule in or rule out sepsis in all children Procalcitonin (PCT) is an early marker of sepsis; it is more sensitive and specific than C -reactive protein (CRP) In normal healthy children the reference range for PCT is <0.05 ng/ml (or microgram per L) but this reference range is not appropriate for PICU In local infection the PCT is typically >2 ng/ml, but may be in the range 0.5 -2 ng/ml In systemic inflamm atory response without bacteraemia PCT is typically 0.5 -2 In bacteraemic is almost always >2 ng/ml, usually >10 ng/ml, and often in the 100s In pneumonia or bronchiolitis a PCT is not very helpful in distinguishing between bacterial and vi ral aetiology, i.e.a child can have RSV bronchiolitis and a PCT of 2 or more; it is only if very high that this is suggestive of bacterial pneumonia . 179 Post cardiopulmonary bypass the PCT increases, peaking on day 2. In the absence of infection the PCT level post-CPB is typically <2.2 ng/ml In neonates in the first 48 hours of life PCT levels are higher than the normal range in older children. A PCT of <10ng/ml can be seen in normal healthy newborns at 24 -48 hours, but in a sick neonate a PCT >10 ng/ml strongly suggests sepsis . After 3 days of age threshold of >2 ng/ml should be used. PCT decreases after infection is treated adequately As it can take 2 hours to get a PCT result, a decision to start antibiotics in a pot entially septic child should not be delayed. Local infection PCT is not needed to diagnose local infections. In many local infections the PCT range overlaps with the range of PCT in uninfected children in intensive care, so it will not be a strong discriminator of local bacterial infection in this population. Also , there are more specific clinical or laboratory signs referable to the site of the local infection (thrombophlebitis, sternal wound inflammation, cellulitis, white cells in urine, new opacity on chest x-ray). If these signs are present local infection is likely. Blood and other cultures should be taken, and the local infection should be treated appropriately (remove the IV drip or catheter, remove the infected sutures, treat the UTI, etc), without the need for using less -specifi c biomarkers. Do not order PCT unless (a) there are clinical signs suggestive of infection and (b) you are prepared to withhold, cease, scale back or not escalate antibiotics if the PCT is <2ng/ml. PCT is not a \"routine daily screening test\" for sepsis. Do not order CRP Always take blood cultures before starting antibiotics 180 RHABDOMYOLYSIS AND MYOGLOBINURIA Causes: prolonged seizure, heat stroke, extreme exercise, sepsis (influenza, group A strep, Staph aureus), crush injury, pressure effects of prolonged surgery, hypokalaemia, snake, spider or scorpion bite, neuroleptic malignant syndrome / malignant hyperthermia, metabolic abnormalities: serum ammonia, urinary organic and amino acids, other metabolic tests as directed by metabolic unit. Early aggressive resuscitation with 0.9% saline is crucial. Maintain normovolaemia: CVP 5 -8 cmH20 1. 50% glucose 30 ml, and mannitol 20g (100 ml of 20%). Give 10 ml/kg/hr IV until there is no myoglobinuria (usually by the third day). Aim for urine output >2ml/kg/hour. 2. Keep urinary pH >6.5. Give acetazolam ide if the blood pH >7.45. 3. Do urgent fasciotomy if compartment pressure >40 mmHg (or > diastolic BP - 30 mmHg) in adult. 4. High-flow CVVHF (see Filtration) : >2x baseline risin g) or fluid overload or metabolic derangement (acidosis and/or K 6.5 or rapidly rising) or poor response to medical therapy . 5. Consider Rasburicase if uric acid level high 6. Metabolic consultation i f cause uncertain . Consider desferrioxamine. 7. Calcium and loop diuretics (eg frusemide) may be harmful. 181 QUALITY Quality in intensive care requires care delivered to accepted standards care based on evidence meticulous attention to detail adequate staff numbers and skills credentialing a continuous quality assurance program including a system of audit, including reporting and investigation of adverse events continuing education research a multidisciplinary approach and an open culture where people's views are respected highly effective communication family -centred ca re and care planning an ethical approach, including a focus on relief of suffering when cure is not possible a safe environment Reporting of adverse events All adverse events should be reported through the Victorian Health Incident Management System (Risk man Q) or through the ICU Quality, Data and Research team The PICU has several internal quality processes : The ICU Quality, Data and Research team collect data regarding admissions, adverse events and complications of disease, and discharges daily Monthly morbidity meeting Monthly quality meeting, which reports quality indicators, including: standardized mortality rates cardiac arrest data ECMO cannulation in PICU accidental extubations hand hygiene compliance central line infections ventilator associated p neumonia nosocomial bacteraemia wound infections accidental device removal pressure areas patient identification compliance sentinal events that occur around MET calls readmission or MET <24 hours post PICU discharge 182 SEPSIS - SEVERE In sepsis -induced hypoperfusion, at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid be given within the first 3 h. Continue fluids resuscitation as long as there is positive effect. If more than 40ml/kg fluid needed, there is an urgent need to differentiate aetiolo gy, address source control, and provide therapy based on the pathophysiology (i.e. vasoplegia, myocardial failure, warm or cold shock, hypovolaemia) . Additional fluids guided by frequent reassessment of HR, neurologic status , SvO2, lactate, CVP trend. Echocardiography enables a more detailed assessment of the causes of the hemodynamic issues Target mean arterial pressure is age either vasopressin 0.02 -0.06 units/kg/hr (especially if contractility acceptable) and adrenaline 0.01-0.5 mcg/kg/min (especially if contractility poor) or dobutamine (up to 15 mcg/kg/min) as next agent s. Consider albumin 4% if > 40ml/kg required. If persistently poor contractility , rising lactate (not due to or (>=9 yr) : consider ECMO (VA, central). Don't use low -dose dopamine for renal prote ction. All patients requiring vasopressors need an arterial catheter placed as soon as practical. Consider steroids (hydrocortisone, 1 mg/kg 6 -8 Hr) if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are unable to restore hemodynamic stability. Respi ratory: give high flow mask oxygen , nasal cannula oxygen or CPAP . Intubation . Indicated if there is severe respiratory distress or hypoxaemia despite oxygen, hypoventilation, impaired mental status or the presence of a severe shock state despite 60ml/kg and inotropes. Intubation can be hazardous, with many children deteriorating significantly on induction . Use ketamine, vecuronium or small doses of fentanyl . Have inotrope running, metaraminol and adrenaline ready (see also section on intubation of the child with pneumonia). Do not use thiopentone or propofol . Ventilation. Use minimum FiO 2 to maintain SpO 2 >90% (PEEP as needed). Ventilate to keep pH >7.25 (but minimum pCO 2 35 mmHg, and max PIP 30 if <12 mo, or 35 if >12 mo). If pH <7.2 5 and base deficit >10 mmol/L, consider bicarbonate (IV over 1 hour). Diagnosis and source identification Send at least two sets of blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) without delaying antibiotic treatment. Send urine culture. No LP in a shocked patien t. Consider other cultures as appropriate 183 (BAL). If a long term line is in -situ, send culture from lines + peripheral culture. Blood cultures volume: c ollect 0.25 ml/kg (minimum 1ml, maximum 20ml) per sample. Higher volumes and multiple sampling times both increase the diagnosis of bacteraemia. There is a higher yield if 2 or 3 (but not more) percutaneous cultures can be performed at least 1hr apart. If only one culture is taken and coagulase negative S epidermidis is isolated, contamination cannot be excluded. If subacute bacterial endocarditis is suspected, take 3 -5 cultures over 48 hours. Percutaneous blood sampling . Wash and glove, keep the skin moist with alcoholic chlorhexidene for at least 2 minutes , allow skin to dry, then use a no -touch techni que. Line culture . Wash and glove, use a swab -stick to care fully remove all visible debris from the 3 -way tap, fill the luer fitting with 70% alcohol for 2 minutes, empty out the alcohol and allow to dry, remove dead space, aspirate the sample, replace th e dead space, clean blood from tap. Antimicrobial therapy Antibiotic therapy should be ini tiated within one hour: specific antibiotics if organism known; otherwise give flucloxacillin (or vancomycin if hospital -acquired), cefotaxime an d genta micin. If a gut source is suspected, give penicillin and gentamicin and metronidazole. Give clindamycin and immunoglobulin if signs of toxin -mediated disease (toxic shock syndrome). If relevant, see on-line Febrile Neutropenia protocol. If relevant see Infections - Hospital acquired for indications for carbapenems. Source control Specific anatomic diagnosis of infecti on requiring emergent source control should be iden tified or excluded as rapidly as possible in pati ents with sepsis or septi c shock, and any required source control interventi ons should be done as a matter of urgency . Immunoglobulin . Give immuno globulin if evidence of toxin - mediated disease (Group A strep or Staph): IVIg 0.5 g/kg IV over 2 hours stat, and after 36 hours. Adjuctive therapies. Consider IV thiamine (if high lactate, malnutrition , vasodilated sepsis ); steroids (as above) ; give G - CSF if neutropenia Renal replacement . Consider venovenous haemo filtration >0.4 mmol/L or increasing >0.1 mmol/L/day. Consider plasma filtration in severe sepsis (see below ). Nutrition. Use enteral feeding early , when organ perfusion restored consider early trophic feeds . Use RCH PICU feeding protocol in case of feed intolerance. Avoid early TPN. Insulin 0.05 u/kg/hr if reqd to keep heparin 10u/kg/hr products . RBC transfusion occur only when hemoglob in concentration decreases to < 7.0 g/dL, in the absence of extenuating circumstances, such as myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, single ventricle physiology, prematurity or acute haemorrhage. Consider platelet transfusion when counts are < 10,000/mm3 in the absence of apparent bleeding and wh en counts are < 20,000/mm3 if the patient has a significant risk of bleeding. Higher platelet counts ( 50,000/mm3) are advised for active bleeding, surgery, or invasive procedures. Plasma filtration Consider in severe sepsis. \u00ad cannula: 8 Fr in child (blood flow 30 -60 ml/min), 11.5 Fr in a teenager filtrate: 20 ml/kg/hr for 6 hr, then 10 ml/kg/hr for 30 hr \u00ad replace any filter that clots before 24 hours \u00ad 100 0u in 50ml saline at 1 -10ml/hr prefilter, 10 00 u in 50 ml saline at 1 -10 ml/hr postfilter. Keep ACT x 1.5 normal (Hemochron 160 citrate dextrose, every of blood \u00ad replacement fluid: de xtrose 0.3%, Na 135 mmol/L, K 3.5, Ca 2.0, Mg 0.7, Bic 25, Phos 1.5, Cl 100, acetate 9.2, albumin 30g/L; give 1 bag of FFP (about 230ml) after every 800 ml of replacement, and cryoprecipitate 5 ml/kg (1 bag/4kg) if fibrinogen <2.0 g/l. REPAIR POST -OP Some c hildren after scolisosis repair will have prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation. Check for lung collapse, pneumonia, chest flail (if more than one rib removed), diaphragm paralysis ( especially if anterior approach). Positioning. Keep the back straight at all times . Beds should generally not be broken, due to the risk of patients sliding down and putting pressure on the instrumentation, which is often in soft bone. If you must break the bed i.e. post extubation then ensure that th e flexion is only at the hips and not in the lower back. Never leave a patient in such a position that they can slide down the bed. A much safer position is with bed tilted rather than broken in the middle. Considering the importance of physiotherapy after extubation, and to increase the chances of successful extubation, aim to extubate these patients early in the day. This will often be day 1 post-op. Children on pre -existing respiratory support (e.g. nocturnal CPAP or BiPAP) or those with other risk factors for respirato ry failure, should be extubated to NIV. Once extubated, all children can be hoisted into a sitting position in a chair (with the help of a physiotherapist). 186 SNAKEBITE Fang marks may not be visible, bite site may not be pain ful. There ma y be headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tender local lymphadenopathy, weakness (ptosis, blurred vision, bulbar palsy, general or respiratory weak ness), coagu lopathy (bleeding, or just a bnormal tests), hypotension, rhab domyolysis and renal failure. Always inform the ICU consultant about any patient with potential or confirmed envenomation. Examine the patient carefully; insert an IV; take FBE, PT, PTT, FDPs, e: - possible bite (asymptomatic, normal coag tests): remove pressure bandage and observe for 4 hours if well - definite bite (asymptomatic, normal coag tests): remove pressure bandage and observe for 12 hours if well - definite bite (mild symptoms, or abnormal coagulation): admit to ICU, test for venom on swab of site (and in urine if swab negative), discuss with ICU consultant - very ill (hypotension, bleeding, paralysis): full resuscitat ion, admit to ICU, leave bandage on (or apply), give 2 amp of tiger and brown snake antivenom (total 4 amp), test for venom on swab of site (and in urine if swab neg ative). Any further antivenom should be for that snake (see below). Obtain more supplies of an tivenom (RCH holds only 4 amp tiger and 4 amp brown). Only remove bandage when stable (may then need more antivenom). Venom detection kit. Used to determine whether enveno mation has occurred (b ut not to decide whether to give antivenom), and which antive nom to use. Do not rely on an observer to identify the snake, use the kit. Antivenom. In Victoria, all snakes are covered by giving anti - venoms against tiger snake (covers re d-bellied black, copper - head and tiger snakes) plus brown snake. Give only for significant symptoms or coagulopathy (not minor symptoms or minor coagulopathy). The dose of antivenom depends on the amount of venom injected, NOT the size of the patient. Repeated doses may be needed if symptoms or coagulopathy persi st (after 30min) or recur. Adrenaline premedication. Give 0.01 ml/kg of 1/1000 SC before the first dose of antivenom. FFP and platelets. Do NOT give these until adequate anti - venom has been given. Tetanus. Give prophylaxis if indicated. 187 SPINAL INJURY Assume any child with significant trauma has a spinal injury Injuries commonly occur at several vertebral levels. < 8 y.o.: ml/kg boluses Hypotension + check loss; give one 10 ml/kg bolus then noradrenaline infusion + atropine or benztropine or benzhexol boluses; insert CVC and measure CVP Beware ongoing paroxysmal bradycardia; esp. with ET suction; consider regular benzhexol or aminophylline. Avoid hard collar < 2 y.o. Maintain spine in alignment without distraction Spine board in children <8 y.o. should have 2 -4 cm deep pad extending from knees to shoulders Remove collar; manual immobilisation and log roll to examine spine. Examine for other injuries: head; neck; C0 -C1# MRI if suspect cord injury, including SCIWORA Nil by mouth until bowel sounds appear; give PPI for 4 weeks Maintain body temp ~36oC Urine catheter: indwelling for 3 -4 days, then intermittent Pressure area care: log roll 2 hourly Pain control: opioids; consider gabapentin DVT prophylaxis in adolescents, especially girls LMW heparin unless surgery is likely; calf compressors Don't give steroids 188 SPLENECTOMY OR ASPLENIA 1. Patients should be informed about the risk of infection, and advised to wear a form of medical alert (eg brace let). Patients should be advised to see their doctor when unwell, when planning to travel to a malaria -endemic area or if bitten by any anim als. 2. The patient's medical records should be pro minently labelled with the information that he or she has had a splenectomy, or is asplenic. 3. Conjugate vaccines against pneumococcus, meningo coccus type c and Haemophilus influenzae type b should be given at least 14 days before splenectomy or as soon as possible after the operation. Booster injections every five years should be considered. Measurement of anti body levels as a guide to the need for revaccination has been suggested, but interpretation is often difficult. 4. Oral phenoxymethylpenicillin (adults: 250 mg or 500 mg twice daily), or, for patients allergic to penicillin, erythro mycin (adults: 250 mg to 500 mg twice daily) should be given for at least one to two years after splenectomy. Immunocompromised patients should be advised to take lifelong prophylaxi s. 5. Upon cessation of penicillin prophylaxis, patients should have an amoxycillin 3 g tablet (for adult) available to take if a fever develops, especially if immediate medical attention is not at hand. 189 SURGICAL PROCEDURES IN THE GENERAL ICU The following surgical or interventional procedures may be done under certain circumstances in the ICU Percutaneous tracheostomy Chest drain insertion Bronchoscopy - flexible Emergency escharotomy burns Wound suturing Cut-down vascular access Bone marrow aspirate Other routine medical procedures done by ICU staff Lumbar puncture Broncho -alveolar lavage Bronchoscopy Vas-cath insertion Not every time or in all circumstances will it be appropriate for these procedures to be done in PICU. If there are multiple proce dures to be done on the one patient it is often better to do these in OT. If OT time is available without delay which would compromise the safety of the patient, procedures such as burns escarotomy are better not done in ICU. The same considerations appl y as in cardiac procedures: procedures can only performed in ICU if there are adequate staff and facilities to do so safely, and if they will not cause excessive disruption to the running of the ICU and the care of other patients. The anticipated duration and complexity of procedures must be taken into account on any given day. The procedure should be planned by the surgeon and ICU consultant together and communicated by the ICU consultant with nursing and other staff. There must be an assessment of feasi bility, availability of staff and timing, before finalising arrangements. If the procedure requires a surgeon (General, Plastic, Neuro, etc) the procedure should be booked as routine through the OT. 190 TRACHEOSTOMY CHANGE Equipment needed before attempting the procedure: oro - pharyngeal airway, suction, replacement tracheostomy tube and smaller reserve tracheostomy tube, lubricant, stomal dilat ors, flexible tubing which can be used as a tracheal guide ( eg a nasogastric tube or tracheal suction catheter with the proximal end cut off). Procedure to be followed: 1. Place a rolled towel or pillow beneath the shoulders of the patient so that the neck is in a position of extension. Do not place the towel or pillow beneath the head of the patient. Position the head, neck and body in -line supine. Lubricate the new tracheostomy tube. 2. Suction the trachea before attempting tube change. 3. Undo the tracheostomy tapes. 4. Ventilate with 100% oxygen for at least 5 breaths so that the lungs are filled with oxygen. 5. Pass the flexible catheter being used as a guide down through the old tracheostomy tube to the carina. 6. Remove the old tracheostomy tube, making sure that the tracheal guide remains in the trachea. 7. Pass the new tra cheostomy tube over the guide into the trachea, and remove the tracheal guide. 8. Bag with 100% oxygen. 9. Re-tie the tracheostomy tapes. Course of action if difficulty is experienced in replacing the tracheostomy tube: 1. If the stoma is constricted, the stomal dilator may be used to aid insertion of the new tube. Alternatively, gradated dilators may be used (for example, a series of smaller to larger size endotracheal tubes). 2. Avoid hypoxaemia at all costs. Remember that unless there is obstruction above the tra cheostomy site, the patient can always be ventilated by bag and mask (with the trache ostomy stoma occluded by a second person using their fingers). Do not persist in your attempts to insert the new tube if the patient is cyanotic; bag and mask until the patient is pink, and then try again with a new or smaller tube. As a last resort, if the new tracheostomy tube cannot be inserted, oral endotracheal intubation may be necessary. The key to an anxiety -free tracheostomy change is to be prepared. If diffic ulty is experienced, ventilate the patient by bag and mask to avoid hypoxaemia between successive attempts. 191 TRACHEOSTOMY SIZES - - - - 2.5 4.0 30/38 Term 3.0 4.2 35 3.0 4.5 30/39 3.0 4.7 32/39 <6mo 3.5 4.9 39 3.5 5.2 32/40 3.5 6.5 36/42 4.0 6.0 36/41 4-5yr 5.0 6.9 50 5.0 7.1 44/50 4.5 6.7 42 6yr 5.0 6.9 50 5.5 7.7 46/52 5.0 7.3 44/60 8yr 6.0 8.2/9.2 55/65 6.0 8.3 5.5 8.0 46 10yr 6.0 8.2/9.2 55/65 6.5 9.0 56 6.0 8.7 70 12yr 7.0 9.6/10.5 65/70 6.5 9.0 56 6.5 9.4 70 14yr 7.0 9.6/10.5 65/70 5.0 9.4 65 7.0 10.0 80 16yr 7.5 10.3/11.3 71/73 6.4 10.8 76 7.5 10.4 80 Adult 8.0 11.0/11.9 76/76 6.4 10.8 76 8.0 11.0 88 Adult 8.0 11.0/11.9 76/76 7.6 12.2 81 8.5 11.8 88 Adult 9.0 12.3/12.3 87/81 7.6 12.2 81 9.0 12.3 98 Adult 10.0 13.7/14.0 98/88 8.9 13.8 81 9.5 13.3 98 a.

Procedures When taking blood samples, eg for a blood gas, full sterile procedure to be followed . 193 TRANSPLANT - LIVER Pre-transplant workup will have been completed before transplant for all patients except fulminant hepatic failure - check with the liver transplant coordinator or hepatologist on call th at the work -up is complete. Post -op management: day of transplant The child will return from theatre with an ETT, NG tube, urinary catheter, triple l umen CVC, arterial line, 2 peripher al IV lines, 1-2 abdominal drains on closed suction, bile duct T -tube on closed drainage, and a Swann Ganz catheter in larger children. Routine care . Nil orally until surgeon says to feed; routine oral hygiene; NG tube on free drainage with hourly aspir ation; strict fluid balance, daily weigh after transfer to ward. Fluid balance. Postoperative fluid requirements are variable. Vasodilatation from rewarming, intra -abdominal bleeding from extensive raw surfaces, and the reaccumu lation of ascites cause extravascular losses that must be corrected. Give sufficient crystalloid to replace urine, insensible and third space losses. The haematocrit should be maintained at around 30% (Hb 90 - 100) to optimise perfusion and risk of hepatic artery throm bosis. Serum albumin should be kept at 28 -30 g/L and right atrial press ure at 9 -10mm Hg Renal function. Often impaired after liver transplantation. Patients may arrive with grossly positive fluid balance yet low filling pressures because of intra -operative blood loss, IVC clamping, noradrenaline to defend MAP for 24h r post -op. Closely monitor fluid balance and volume status, urine output. If the urine output drops, give fluid challenge: 4% albumin g/l). If urine osmolality < plasma, give frusemide. If no response , give mannitol 0.25 gm/kg, then a large dose of frusemide + hydrochloro thiazide. If oliguria persists, use haemofiltration early. Cardiac output may be 2 -3 times normal with the new liver. Maintain CVP approximately 9 - 10 mmHg. Check Na+, K+, urea and cre atinine 4 -6 hourly. In established renal failure, replace urine output, insensible losses, NG aspirate, drainage and bile losses and review all drugs. Abdominal drains . The Jackson Pratt drains are con nected to Minivacs. There may be substantial loss, w ith ascites, chylous 194 peritoneal fistula due to coeliac axis dissection, leak age from raw surface if cut down liver. Bleeding or bile leakage may require reoperation (as citic fluid can be easily mistaken for bile. The JP drains should be milked hourly (wet w ith Hexol or Alcowipe) and a sample of drain fluid taken at least daily: the drain is disconnected, emptied, wiped with Betadine and recon nected using a no -touch technique. The surgeons should be notified if the haemoglobin concentration of drain fluid >3 gm/100 ml. The drain is removed on day 2 -10. Drain losses should be replaced ml for ml with 4% albumin. Check electrolyte and protein content daily to guide re place ment. T -tube. In patients who have had duct-to-duct reconstruction, a T -tube is left in pl ace and drained into a closed system. Because of delayed healing due to protein malnutrition and high dose steroids, the T -tube is left in place for at least 3 months. The bag is only changed as necessary. Early withdrawal is associated with a high risk of biliary leak. In patients in whom the recipient common bile duct cannot be used for reconstruction, a choledocho -jejunostomy is constructed using a Roux loop. This will have external drainage but radiological definition will be suboptimal as the tube has end and side holes. The tube is clamped around day 10 to 12. Clamping the T -Tube and cholangiography will usually result in a jump in hepatic enzymes. Clamping the T -Tube will increase absorption of cyclosporin (but not tacrolimus). All invasive radiology of the bile tract must be covered with prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of septicaemia. CVS monitoring . Car diac monitoring includes ECG, BP, toe temp, urine output and plasma lactate. Rarely, cardiac output is measured by themodilution via a Sw ann Ganz catheter. Arterial lines and 4F central lines are flushed with hep saline 1u/ml at 1 ml/hr. No heparin is used in any other line, including a haemo - filter (bu t see Haemofilter protocol below). Hypertension is always present post -transplant and usu ally lasts some weeks. The BP is very labile and is affected by volume loading, cyclosporin, tacrolimus and steroids. Exclude correctable causes (hypoventilation, hypoglycaemia, fits, awareness, pain). Hypertension is controlled (due to the risk of bleedin g) using SNP (measure plasma cyanide) and esmolol. Later, control BP with captopril, nifedipine and atenolol orally. Central nervous system . Full neuro obs chart is important post - op, especially when coma was present before operation. Development of encep halopathy may mean a non -functioning hepatic graft, but is difficult to recognise in a paralysed and sedated patient. D ilated or sluggishly reactive pupils plus irritability may be the only signs. Papilloedema is uncommon. Circulatory instability may indic ate coning and may require 195 urgent measures to control ICP: consider craniectomy and hypothermia; elevate head of bed 20o; ventilate to PaCO 2 35 - 40 mmHg; mannitol 0.25 - 0.5 g/kg; aim for a serum 145 -150 mmol/l and plasma osmolality 300 -310 mOsm/kg. Respiratory . Take chest x -ray on return to ICU, then daily as required. PEEP should be kept low, as high PEEP levels red uce hepatic blood flow. 2 hrly suctioning of ETT while intubated. Ventilation is usually needed only for 24 -48 hrs postop. Spontaneous v entilation will be allowed as soon as conscious state and gas exchange allow, with early extubation. The patient should remain in ICU following extubation and be rei ntubated promptly if respiratory function is inadequate. Pulmonary infections are a major p roblem because of decreased vital capacity, the subcostal incision, pleural effusions and respiratory muscle weakness due to preoperative malnutrition. Atelectasis is treated with aggressive physiotherapy. Chest physiotherapy with face mask CPAP and deep b reathing and coughing exercises should start immediately after extubation. Pleural effusions, particularly on the right side are common after liver transplantation, but usually resolve spontaneously; occasionally thoracentesis is required if ventilation is impaired. Ascites can rapidly traverse the diaphragm and cause tension hydrothorax. Pulmonary oedema often occurs postoperatively and may be difficult to diagnose, as it may occur with low filling pressures and with a normal or high urine output: a dose of frusemide, and repeat examination and chest x -ray may clarify the diagnosis. Pulmonary capillary injury similar to ARDS may develop with fulminant hepatic infarction or sepsis. High cyclosporin concentra tions administered into a cent ral vein may precipitate wheezing, so cyclosporin must be given by infusion into a peripheral vein. Older children with long -standing cirrhosis may have substantial pre -transplant hypertension). Temperature . Hypothermia is common on arrival in ICU because of long operation time, large volume replacement, veno -venous bypass, and rewarming of a cold liver graft. Nurse babies <7 kg on a radiant heater. Rewa rming may require a heating blanket, heated humidification, and warmed fluid infusions. Any fever is abnormal and should be investigated. Infection control . More than 50% of patients develop bacterial, fungal or viral infections after liver transplan tation: m ost pathogens originate from endogenous flora. The risk is greatest in the first 6 wks. Reverse barrier nurse in a single room for t he first 48 hours postoperatively. Use gowns while the child is 196 ventilated and invasively monitor ed, but hats and masks are not required. All IV, IA and CVC lines, dr ain tubes, tracheal aspirate and urine are cultured daily. Tips should be cultured on removal of lines. All procedures will be carried out by using RCH PICU protocols, adhering to them very strictly (3rd daily CVC and peripheral line changes with scrubbing to change them, scrubbing to break into a central line, clean no -touch method to give IV drugs via a drug bung.) After extubation and removal of invasive monitoring lines, reverse barrier nursing is replaced by routine precautions. This means: a single room; very strict hand washing protocols; gowns to protect clothing; restrict visitors to two per child (none with infections). Patient movement and data. Most patients stay in ICU for two or more days before trans fer to the ward. A flow chart of pathology results and clinical data will be main tained in the patient's room. Once mobile, the pat ient may go outside the ward with mask on for limited periods in non -crowded areas (eg Avoid Starlight room, McDonald's etc) . Electrolytes and glucose. Patients with end stage liver disease often have low plasma Na, K, Ca, Mg and PO4 because of prolonged diuretic therapy. This will be complicated by intraoperative changes in serum K and ionised Ca. Potassium. Reperfusion of the new liver is associated with severe but transient hyperkalaemia. Serum K will fall as the hepatocytes take up K, and molar KCl in fusion may be required. Persistent hyperkalaemia often means poor liver function. Graft necrosis can result in sudden r elease of large amounts of K and consequent hype rkalaemia. Sodium . An accurate assessment of total Na loss can be made from the volume and measured Na content of drain fluid, bile and urine output. The Na content of infus ions and drugs should be noted. H ypernatraemia and hypo natraemia should be corrected no faster than 0.5 mmol/L/hr. Calcium, phosphate, magnesium . Low Ca, Mg and PO4 after operation may require correction. PO4 falls as liver function recovers post -transplant as a general re -feeding phen omenon. Both cyclosporin and tacrolimus cause high urinary loss of Mg. Check Na, K, Mg, PO 4 4-6 hourly. Check liver enzymes, proteins, bilirubin and NH 4 on arrival from theatre and 12 hourly thereafter (6 hourly if there is a problem). Citrate intoxication and acidosis is common following massive transfusion and is an early sign of poor liver function. The resulting acidosis is corrected wit h bicarbonate and hypocalcaemia with Ca. A 197 normally functioning graft metabolises citrate and converts a mild to moder ate metabolic acidosis to a mild alkalosis within a few hours. Rewarming and restoration of peripheral perfusion further reduces the acidosis. Glucose . Revascularisation of the grafted liver is associated with increased glucose uptake. Hyperglycaemia imme diately postop is due to the glucose content of infused blood, and decreased utilisation due to hypothermia and high dose steroids: insuli n infusion may be needed. Nutrition . Most children requiring liver transplant have pre - existing protein -calorie malnu trition. Post -op energy requirements are high. Enteral feeding will commence as soon as normal gut activity returns, 24 -72 hours post -op. TPN may be required 36 -72 hours post -op, if there is no gut activity. Consult the hepatologist before using Intralipi d. Insulin may be needed for hyperglycaemia. Coagulopathy . Children with liver failure have elevated PT and APTT and decreased factors (II, VII, IX, X and XII), low platelet count, and elevated FDP with fibrinolysis. Fibrino gen and factor VIII are usually normal. These abnormalities are only corrected pre-op if the patient is bleeding. During transplantation, administration of FFP, platele ts, blood, and cryoprecipitate is titrated against bleeding and test abnormalities, especially thromboelastograp hy. Low antithrombin III, protein C, protein S levels can lead to thrombosis of hepatic artery, hepatic and portal veins. Routine Management: APTT Hb at 90 -100 g/L; give platelets only after d iscussion with the transplant unit; FFP is given for coagulopathy only if INR >3 and after discussion with the transplant unit; heparin is given SC or by IV infusion post -op when the PT and APTT fall below 1.5 times normal (maintain anti-Xa levels of 0.1 -0.3 IU/ml, mild anticoagulation). Heparin is replaced by aspirin when oral intake is established and no short term need for liver biopsy. All patients are given dextran 40 for 5 days postop. Measure antithrombin III (AT III), protein C and protein S levels daily. Maintain AT III level at >80% control - use 1000u daily. Maintain protein C and S at >60% activity using FFP 15ml/kg. There should be 2 units of cross -matched blood available at all times. Severe coagulopathy: bleeding from all puncture sites often indicates deteriorating liver function. Intra - abdominal bleeding (increased abdominal girth and falling haematocrit): obtain urgent ultrasound; correct abnor malities of coagulation (usually needs laparotomy). 198 Haemofil tration. If the liver is still functioning and haemo - filtration is required, use ACD solution instead of heparin in the circuit. If the liver is not functioning, only albumin or saline solution should be used. ACT should still be checked hourl y. Watch the circuit closely for the formation of clots. (1) If clotting normal and platelets normal: give replacement fluid pre -filter, prime with total 10u/kg infuse 10 (2) If platelets <60,000 but no clinic al bleeding: no heparin in prime, infuse replacement fluid pre -filter, infuse prostacyclin 5 ng/kg/min pre -filter. (3) If clinical bleeding and coagulopathy: no heparin in prime, infuse replacement fluid pre-filter, no heparin or prostacyclin. (4) If fulmi nant 5mg/kg 12hrly via NG tube. IV cyclosporin is only used in exceptional circum stances. Take blood for level just before 9am dose (do not wait for result); Gastroenterology will obtain the result and adjust the 9pm dose to achieve tacrol imus level 300 ng/ml. mg/kg nocte. Rejection. Manage in consultation with hepatologist on call. Ensure the cyclosporin/ tacrolimus level is adequate. Pulse methylprednisolone, if fails OKT3. Antibiotics Preopera tive prophylaxis. To be given in theatre and repeated at hepatectomy as necessary, then for 48 hours post -op. Cefotaxime 25mg/kg 8hrly x 6 doses; T pro cedure; amox ycillin 25 mg/kg before procedure. Antibiot ics changed according to the sensitivities of any organisms recently grown in the bile. Antifungal prophylaxis (for 1 month post -op). N 6hrly plus 2ml for 3 months. CMV seronegative recipients of CMV positive donors will receive 199 gancyclovir (instead of acyclovir) for 3 months, then acyclovir: 5mg/kg/dose IV, or 20 -40mg/kg/dose donor. Pneumocystis prophylaxis (should commence within one week of transplant and continue for 6 months). Cotrimox azole (40/200) <2yr 2.5ml daily oral, to cotrimaxazole, give pentamidine 3mg/kg monthly by inhalation for 6 months . Other drugs Analgesia. Morphine infusion starting at 20 mcg/kg/hr and increased cautiously if necessary, titrated against pain, wakefulness and breathing, reduce if poor liver or kidney function. Avoid barbiturates in encephalopathy. Prostaglandin E1. Used as immunosuppressant. Causes splanchnic vasodilatation, decreases acid secretion in the gut, protects hepatocytes Dose hrly IV or oral. Anticoagulation. Heparin 10 u/kg/hr IV infusion when PR and PTTK <1.5 times normal. Maintain anti -Xa levels of 0.1 -0.3 IU/ml (mild anticoagulation). Antithrombin III. Once daily if the antithrom bin III level <80%. Dose 1000 International units (ie 1 vial). Dextran 40 in N/saline or 5% dextrose <10kg 8 -15kg 50mg daily orally; >15kg 100mg daily oral. Vitamins A, E, and K. Vit amin K on return from theatre and daily until established oral intake. Micelle A & E 1 ml daily by mouth. Folate 2.5 mg/5ml/day oral for 2 wk. Investigations Radiology. CXR on admission to ICU and daily. Ultra sound or Doppler of hepatic artery, hepatic veins and portal vein daily in ICU. Haematology. FBE, differential and coags on admission, then 6 hourly in ICU (x1 -2/day in ward); antithrombin III, protein C&S daily (at 9 am, 2 citrate tubes, sent to Alfred lab); weekly serum folate and Biochemistr y. PO4, Mg, level 10 -15mg/L. Microbiology. Daily in ICU: bile, drain fluid, sputum for M+C and fungi, urine for M+C, blood culture. CMV. Saliva swab in viral transport medium, urine and blood: weekly for 6 wk , then 2wkly for 3 months. CMV antigenemia and PCR weekly. Liver Biopsy.

For all cases of major trauma, the trauma team should be activated, which will notify the ICU AUM, ICU consultant, Emergency Dept registrar, Gen eral Surgery registrar (or consultant), radiographer, blood bank, and Neurosurgery registrar (if appropriate). The trauma team is activated from the emergency departmen t by the ED AUM or ED resuscitation consultant. Notification sho uld not be too early (eg don't tell the neurosurgeon at 3am about a patient arriving at 6am). A senior PICU doctor (fellow or senior registrar) should attend all ED trauma calls, to assist wi th airway management and provide specialized guidance on overall management. Role Allocation: Team leader (TL) : Usually ED resus consultant. Allocate roles and responsibilities according to skill/experience; perform trauma team activation; Ensure PPE incl uding lead worn by all team members; pre -arrange radiographer, order xrays and discuss CT; contact blood bank for blood in motion/MTP; obtain pre - hospital handover and involve PETS consultant if transport not being undertaken by MICA; allocate family suppo rt; contact other units (eg Neurosurgery, orthopaedics) as needed; formally handover to appropriate medical team member at the appropriate time and place. *Team leader support: ICU registrar role if anaesthetics managing airway : Discuss management and offe r advice to TL; Liaise with specialty units; Assist with appropriate investigation ordering and review results; Liaise with family to gain further info; ensure blood bank aware; consider longer term requirements of care. *Airway doctor : ICU registrar or an aesthetic registrar .

If patient dies, or is DOA, SW present during family meeting, assist with contacting family, friends, clergy ; support funeral arrangements, autopsy, organ donation etc; support family during notifi cation to coroner, identifying body to police etc. *Likely ICU doctor roles. Helicopter reception . In most cases the flight paramedics will trans fer the patient from the helipad to ED assisted by RCH PSAs. In the unlikely event that the child is too unstable, a MET call will be called to the helipad reception area: Both Emergency Department team (nurse and doctor) and ICU team (nurse and doctor) sh ould attend. ED team brings an oxygen cylinder with Twin -O-Vac and tubing for oxygen and suction. RCH reception teams wait behind the sliding door at the helipad until beckoned. Principles of primary rece ption of an injured child: Airway, Breathing, Ci rculation, Cervical spine, Disability ( GCS ), and Exposure (completely undress patient but keep warm). 2 large bore cannulae in upper limb veins. Insert intra -osseous needle if IV takes more than 90 sec. Immobilise cervical spine: Aspen + sandbags (see Spinal cord injury) Take blood for glucose and X -match and any other necessary tests as soon as the IV cannula is inserted. Cross -match amount depends on body size and amount of bleeding: usually at least 4 units for a school -age child. Persistent t achycardia may represent inadequate resuscitation, occult bleeding, intrathoracic injuries (pneumothorax/pericardial tamponade) or inadequate analgesia/sedation. Arrange FFP and platelets if anticipate loss > 40 ml/kg (activate massive transusion protocol) . Ensure stable airway, breathing and circulation before transfer to CT, but otherwise ensure no other delays to CT scan (eg insertion of arterial and central lines must not delay CT scan 208 unless essential for stability). If head injury suspected or confirm ed, defend blood pressure and target normoxia and normocapnoea (CO 2 35-40, SpO 2 95- 99%) with safe ventilation. Chest X -ray immediately on arrival (get out of the radio grapher's way). X -rays of pelvis, cervical spine, thoraco lumbar spine and extremities c ould wait until CT done if this will delay transfer. Spine boards are radiolucent, take X -rays through them. Log -roll every 30 min while on spine board. Patient transfers between trolley, bed and CT scanner require log roll and strict in line spine immobil ization, with the airway doctor in control at the child's head. Log-roll to examine the spine before transferring to CT scan: use correct log -roll technique: Airway doctor looks after head; at least 2 other people (3 others for an older child); one turns t he shoulders, one the pelvis, one the legs (overlapping arms, the person minding the head calls the time of turning). Turn all trauma patients hourly unless a consultant provides written orders to the contrary. Transfer to CT scan. Portable monitor. Hand -ventilate, or portable ventilator if lungs are abnormal. At minimum, one doctor, one nurse + emergency dept orderly accompany the child to CT. Log roll and inline stabilization for transfers. Don't attempt to place the child's head in the head -rest on the CT scanner (risk of neck movement). Don't use either the ventilator or the anaesthetic machine that is kept in CT (use the portable ventilator, or hand -ventilate). Radiology. Notify a radiographer within 15min prior to the child's arrival, so that he or she is waiting in ED when child arrives. If child has a head injury, mention to the radio grapher that the child will need an urgent head CT scan. This can b e done without a consultant radiologist present. Obtain a chest X -ray immediately on arrival (get o ut of the radio grapher's way). X -ray pelvis, cervical/thoracolumbar spine, and extremities shouldn't delay transfer. If the surgical consultant or registrar wants a CT scan of the abdomen, they should notify the consultant radiologist well before the chil d is transferred to Radiology for head CT. If first chest X -ray shows wide mediastinum, and question of thoracic aortic tear arises, obtain a second chest X -ray in full inspiration and 15o head -up (tilt the whole bed, not just the head end and watch the bl ood pressure). Identification. Each child (unless known to be an ol d RCH patient) is given an Unknown Male or Unknown Female identifier including wrist bands in ED 209 Notification and consultation. The team leader (or support) notifies the specialty surgica l units (eg neurosurgery, ortho paed - ics, plastics, ophthalmology) of the child's arrival, and notifies theatre and duty anaesthetist as necessary. Disposal. An ICU patient should return from the CT scanner to ICU (or occasionally, directly to Theatre). S ome children with an intracranial haematoma can be extubated in the operating theatre after craniotomy or burr holes, and go directly to the ward from there. Longer term management. At 0700 every day there will be a trauma huddle to assist with coordinati on of the early surgical management of any patients admitted within the prior 24 hours. A representative from ICU should attend for any patients admitted to ICU. Consider MRI to investigate C-spine if unable to clear clinically because of young age, agitated state, sedation, unable to cooperate ; Spinal clearance according to hospital protocol ( Orthopaedics unless Neurosurgery managing TBI); Consider DVT prophylaxis in post -pubertal children; Tertiary survey to be completed by the Trauma team unless delegated to PICU. 210 VENTILATION Start with a tidal volume or PIP that produces visible chest movement, then measure blood gases after 15 minutes and adjust the ventilator according to PaCO 2 and PaO 2. Pressure -limited ventilation should be used if child <15 kg. If a child has lung disease, use controlled hypoventilation (unless there is brain injury) and try to keep the FiO 2 <0.5 to avoid iatrogenic lung damage. Gas exchange is usually better when the good lung is uppermost in infants and children <5 years, and when it is dependent in adults. Triggered ventilation is more comfortable than un -triggered, and uses lower tidal volumes and airway pressures. Ensure that the apparatus dead space is minimal. Use lightweight tubing in small children to avoid accidental extubation. Do not use narrow tubing in patients < 20 kg . When using volume -cycled ventilation, record the peak pressure. With pressure -limited ventilation, record tidal volume. Volume - cycled pressure -limited ventilation yields little information about lung compliance. Respiratory rate per min: neonate 30 -60, 6mo 25 -30, 1 -5yr 20 - 25, 5 -12yr 15 -20, >12yr 12 -15. A-aDO 2 = PAO 2 - PaO 2 = ((Pbar - Pwater) x FiO 2) - (PaCO 2 / 0.8) - PaO 2. Usually = (716xFiO 2) - (PaCO 2/0.8) - PaO ((60/RR) -IT))) / (60/RR). Oxygenation index (OI) = MAP x FiO 2 / PaO 2. Ventilation index (VI) = pCO 2 x RR x PIP / 1000. WEANING Infants should usually be extubated from a rate of 5, and not have a period of endo tracheal CPAP before ex tubation . Infants : usually wean by rapid reduction in IMV rate to 5/min (followed by extubation if indic ated), rather than a very gradual reduction in assi st pressures or IMV rate . Older children : a trial of several hours CPAP + PS allows assessment of adequacy of gas exchange pre -extubation. Children who have been intubated for (say) >3 days, are often extubated to nasal CPAP or High Flow rather than nasal prongs. This is particularly the case for neonates post -cardiac surgery. AVEA VENTILATOR Modes : Control. Ventilator delivers set pressure or tidal volume at a set inspiratory flow and rate. If assist sensitivity set to off, patient 211 prohibited from trigger ing breaths between the machine breaths. Suitable only for paralysed patients. Assist -control. A machine breath of pre -set pressure or tidal volume given if patient does not trigger a breath within a time determined by the set rate. If patient effort is su fficient to trigger during expiration, after expiration has finished an assist breath given. Breath period is reset when the patient trigger is detected. SIMV. Machine -generated breath only delivered if there is no patient inspiratory effort at or above t he preset sensitivity level (trigger) in the previous breath period. The first patient trigger during a breath period results in an assist breath (pre -set volume or pressure). If there are additional patient triggers in the breath period, pressure support is given (or no assistance if PS is off). Breath period is not reset when the patient initiates a breath. CPAP. Patient initiates all breaths. If PS activated, triggers assist breaths. Only for spontaneously breathing patients. APRV -Biphasic. Airway pressure release ventilation. Similar to BiPAP. Patient can breathe spontaneously at two pressure levels. Adjust time high and low, pressure high and low, and pressure support. Five breath types TCPL (time cycled, pre ssure limited). Ventilator deliv ers set inspiratory flow to reach set inspi ratory pressure for set time (i - time). No volume guarantee; tidal volume varies with changes in compliance and resistance in patient's airway. Pressure control. Ventilator regulates inspir flow to main tain set pressure for set period (difference to TCPL is that rate is set, rather than the i-time). No volume guarantee. Volume control. Set tidal volume, breath rate and flow rate. Pressures vary with lung compliance and resistance. Volume assured pressure support. Combines pressure support with tidal volume guarantee. Set mode (AC or SIMV), set breath rate, set sensitivity, set insp pressure above PEEP. Turn dial to VAPS, adjust tidal volume. Set high peak insp press alarm 5-8 cmH2O above insp press. Breath will te rminate when maximal tidal volume delivered. Pressure support. Breaths always initiated by the patient. Set assist sensitivity. Set PS level (above PEEP). Triggering Pressure triggering. 1-20cmH 20. Flow triggering. Infant flow sensor detects 0.2 -3.0 L/min; placed between patient Y and ETT. Paediatric flow sensor detects 1 -5 L/min; placed between exhalation valve and patient breathing circuit (all modes except TCPL). Termination sensitivity Active only fo r TCPL breat hs. With termination sensitivity on, inspiratn terminated at 5 -25% of peak flow, or time cycled 212 (breath rate based on set I time), whichever first. Cycling: the variable that terminates inspiration (pressure, volume, flow or time cycling) Flow cycle. (In A dvanced Settings) Terminates TCPL or pressure support l breath when flow falls to set % of initial flow. Start with 5% Volume limit. Terminates a pressure -limited breath when tidl volume reches a set value. Inspiratory rise. Determines the slope of pressure rise during a mandatory breath (not active in TCPL). Bias flow. Sets the gas flow in the tubing between breaths. Pressure trigger. Pressure below PEEP which triggers a mandatory or pressure -supported breath. Instead of flow trigger. HIGH FREQUENCY OSCILL ATORY VENTILATION Infant: MAP 18 -25, 8 -12 -P 30 -40 cmH 2O, IT 33% . Aim for wiggle down to upper thigh. Child: MAP 20 -30, 6 -8 Hz, delta -P 40-60, IT 33% Adolescnt -adult: MAP 25 4 -6 delta -P 50 -90, IT 33% SpO 2 80-85% usually adequate. To improve oxygenation, increase MAP or FiO 2. Aim for FiO 2 <0.5. Use chest X -ray to adjust MAP (avoid under or over inflation). To improve ventilation (lower pCO 2), reduce frequency (Hz) or incr amplitude (delta -P). Frequency <5Hz unusual. ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARD S) Sedate with morphine, and midazolam or diazepam. Try patient - triggered ventilation first, paralyse if gases poor. If gases still poor, try HFOV. Do BAL, start antibiotics. Insert central and arterial l ines. Echo to assess cardiac function and pul hypertension. Start with low tidal volumes of 6 -8ml/kg, peak pressure <30cm, PEEP 8 -10cm, FiO 2 <0.5. If no brain injury, accept pCO 2 60-80mmHg and pH> 7.2 unless this causes cardiac failure from pulmonary hyper tension. SpO 2 80-85% will be adequate for most patients. Recruit collapsed alveoli using 15 -30sec inflation 5 -10cm above PEEP; clamp ETT when reconnecting to ventila tor. Consider prone positioning for 4 hours at a time to recruit posterior lung segments. Consider adrenaline infusion 0.03 -0.1 mcg/kg/min to improve pulmonary blood flow. Consider trial of NO (stop after 30min if no measured response). Give enteric feeds (jejunal tube often needed) or TPN. >24hr, K, or crea tinine >0.4. 213 WARD ROUND CHECKLIST The following items should be discussed for every patient as part of the ward round to ensure quality care and communication with team members : Airway ETT - Can it be secured better, position on x -ray?
