Chiropractic looks at not only the structural but the mental, emotional, and nutritional side of wellness. Chiropractic care ensures that the spine works properly to maximize normal nerve flow and minimize pressure on the nervous system from stress and postural strain or injury, leading to pain, dysfunction, and decreased quality of life. It is gratifying to see people of all ages turning to chiropractic as a safe and effective alternative to medication and surgery for a wide variety of health issues. The goal of chiropractic care is to relieve pain, promote healing, restore and maintain function, reduce the likelihood of re-injury, restore proper motion, and prevent accelerated degenerative spine disease. Comprehensive chiropractic healthcare goes much further. It all comes back to wellness, defined as not simply the absence of sickness. Wellness suggests a proactive approach to living, which results in optimal physical, emotional, and social well-being. This involves learning how to get healthy and stay healthy by practicing positive health habits and giving up harmful ones. To do this, we teach people to listen and respond to their bodies warning signals before illness interrupts life's activities. The chiropractor's role is to facilitate and increase the potential for health so we can live life to its fullest. Specialized Care of Chiropractors Over the last 124 years, chiropractic care has been the leading natural and non-invasive approach to treating chronic spinal pain conditions. The field of chiropractic medicine continues to change. Our clinic and our chiropractic physicians specialize in using the best combination of chiropractic care with spinal rehabilitation for pain management and pain relief, with the long-term goal of spinal stability. Doctors of Chiropractic - often referred to as chiropractors or chiropractic physicians \u2014 practice a drug-free, hands-on approach to health care that includes patient examination, diagnosis, and treatment. Chiropractors have broad diagnostic skills and are also trained to recommend therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises and provide nutritional, dietary, and lifestyle counseling. The most common therapeutic procedures performed by doctors of chiropractic are known as \"spinal manipulation,\" also called \"chiropractic adjustment.\" The purpose of manipulation is to restore joint mobility by manually applying a controlled force into joints that have become hypomobile \u2014 or restricted in their movement - resulting from a tissue injury. Tissue can be caused by a single traumatic event, such as the improper lifting of a heavy object, or through repetitive stresses, such as sitting in an awkward position with poor spinal posture for an extended period of time. In either case, injured tissues undergo physical and chemical changes that can cause inflammation, pain, and diminished function for the sufferer. Manipulation, or adjustment of the affected joint and tissues, restores mobility, thereby alleviating pain and muscle tightness and allowing tissues to heal. Chiropractic adjustments rarely cause discomfort. However, patients may sometimes experience mild soreness or ache following treatment (as with some forms of exercise) that usually resolves within 12 to 48 hours. In many cases, such as lower back pain, chiropractic care may be the primary treatment method. When other medical conditions exist, chiropractic care may complement or support medical treatment by relieving the musculoskeletal aspects associated with the condition. Doctors of chiropractic may assess patients through clinical examination, laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging, and other diagnostic interventions to determine when chiropractic treatment is appropriate. Chiropractors will readily refer patients to the appropriate health care provider when chiropractic care is not suitable for the patient's condition or the condition warrants co-management in conjunction with other healthcare team members. What We Offer! At Care Medical Center, we offer holistic care, as all of our treatments are non-invasive alternatives to traditional medicine. Holistic care addresses the patient as an individual rather than a symptom or condition. Care at our office includes chiropractic adjustments, spinal corrective rehabilitative exercises, physical therapy, and spinal decompression. Because your entire body is based on signals sent through your spine, chiropractic adjustments and rehabilitation can often correct an upset that lies elsewhere in the body as well as those directly related to the spinal column. We offer post-surgical pain management when necessary as well as coordinate your care with other providers. "}
