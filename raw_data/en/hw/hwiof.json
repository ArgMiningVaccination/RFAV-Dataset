And the purity culture of our youth sold the same excuses with a spiritual spin. Can we break the toxic cycle and recover a healthy identity for men? In Non-Toxic Masculinity, Zachary Wagner tells men, \"If you are in Christ, this is your problem-and you should be part of the solution.\" Reflecting on his own coming of age in the purity culture movement and ongoing recovery from sexual shame, Wagner confronts harmful teaching from the American church that has distorted desire, sex, relationships, and responsibility. For those-both men and women-who feel disillusioned and adrift, this book offers a renewed vision for Christian male sexuality founded in empathy and selflessness. "}
