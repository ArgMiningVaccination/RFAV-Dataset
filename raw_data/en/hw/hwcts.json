I am committed to further these efforts. Sincerely, Rob Femia, Chairman DC-06/22/2022HONORING OUR FRONTLINE ED WORKERS When the pan- demic struck, I had been bringing art to the hospital for almost 5 years, as I curated the Gallery for Art and Healing with Dr. Lewis Goldfrank and Joan Demas. So, as I was in isolation in my studio, I was aware and focused on what might be happening at the Bellevue Emergency Department. One day, I read about an artist from California, Michael Gittes, who made paintings for all the staff at Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn. The next morning in my studio, I picked up a tin y 2\"x2\" canvas and thought, why not a painting for each of the staff at Bellevue ED? This project was not anything I actually analyzed or thought about. When inspiration hits, the best response is to create. Once I started, I couldn't stop. The paintings are an expression of my deep appreciation to the staff of the Emergency Department. My feeling is that what one creates doesn't bec ome art until it's viewed by another human being. That experi-ence, the response, gives the object it's life. The staff will be giving life to these paintings. The subjects of the paintings are the individual her oism of each staff per- son holding together to create a pow-erful response to our common tragedy. Each staff member and visiting staff will receive a painting in the next months. Later, a print of the assembled 2x2's will hang in the Emergency Department.

The idea occurred organically during the COVID-19 pandemic out of a strong desire to educate patients regarding their COVID-19 diagnosis, while also providing medical students with a meaningful clinical experience. We could not have done it without the strong support of our department leadership; operations, telemedicine, patient safety, medical education, clin-ical site chiefs and nursing leadership. As three women in Emergency Medi-cine we want to pave the way for other women physician leaders to innovate projects they are passionate about. Why did you choose emergency medicine?W e love the excitement of the emer- gency dep artment, the diverse disease processes that we are trained to treat and the ability to connect with pa-tients from a variety of backgrounds. What was the toughest hurdle you overcam e in your careers? I'm sure we can all agree that we never t hought we would be fighting a global pandemic during our resi-dency, let alone be in the epicenter with the world watching us. COVID-19 exposed the fragility of our healthcare system, disparities in healthcare, the need for resource allocation, as well as our mortality. It was and has been the most challenging aspect of our careers thus far, but the experience has made us better physicians and humans. If you could change one thing about your training as emergency physi-cians, what would it be?This pandemic has shown us that EM physici ans are under a great deal of stress and are particularly suscepti-ble to mental health issues given the intense environment in which we work. Small changes such as taking a short lunch break away from the clinical area can go a long way toward on-shift resiliency. Similarly, debriefing after an emotional patient encounter can serve as a team building exercise and foster a supportive environment. We shoul d continue to instill on-shift wellness initiatives throughout our training and normalize being human in medicine. What is the toughest challenge fac- ing emerg ency physicians during COVID-19?Battling the misinformation and politi-cization o f a disease that we have seen affect our patients, their families and our colleagues so profoundly. How do you stay enthusiastic? Getting to work alongside our friends/co-r esidents and the excitement of never truly knowing what is about to come through the ED doors next.

The EM community has worked tirelessly to build FOAM and explore innovative approaches to education. This award is an important step in acknowledging this innovation.ANYONE. ANYWHERE.ANYTIME.\" In college, my advisor told me I would never get into medical school. My fail-ures in undergrad were important asthey forced me to examine what I wanted and what I would need to do to get there. It forced me to buildresilience. It is a continuous challenge to build and maintain resilience par-ticularly as we fight our waythrough a pandemic. I wish I was mature enough when I trained, to l earn everything I could from the wonderful mentors thatsurrounded me. As a resident, I didn't realize how lucky I was to have Lewis Goldfrank, Neal Lewin, Maureen Gang, Jeff Manko, Bob Hoffman and Steve Menlove around to learn from. We must maintain our mental health. In the best of times, em ergency physi- cians do a poor job of caring forthemselves. These are not the best of times. We need to find time to care for ourselves and our colleagues. Medicine is a noble calling. We are fortunat e to be able to do what we do. The challenge of caring for peoplewith critical illness, the quest to learn something today that can help some-one tomorrow and to pass on thatknowledge keeps me moving forward. 10 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022THE INVESTIGATORAWARD ALEX MANINI, MD (MED TOX '08) It is an incredible honor to be named the inaugural SAEM Mid-career Investigator award. It means that I am on the right path and doing what I am passionate about seems to be working out OK. Initially my affinity for the broad scope of EM, my des ire to see many patients daily and my inclination for a proce-dure-oriented career drew me to look further into the specialty. Over time, my experiences with research, inter-national medicine, administration and education all cemented my commit-ment to the exciting field of emergency medicine. The K to R level funding transition is a noto riously difficult hurdle to accomplish, especially in the times of diminishing NIH budgets and increas-ing competitiveness for federal grant funding. Thankfully I was able to draw upon the wisdom and experiences of some tremendous mentors to get me across that particular finish line, such as Lynne Richardson, Yasmin Hurd, and David Vlahov. Good mentors are so important, not only because of the GOOD MENTORS ARE SO IMPORTANT.\" knowledge and skills we can learn, but also because mentoring provides personal support to facilitate success in one's early career and beyond. Quality mentoring greatly enhances one's chances for success. Adopting the \"pain is the 6th vital sign\" durin g the era of my training has to be among the biggest mistakes we as a specialty have made and is the one thing I would change. Now it is up to us, as emergency physicians to be part of the solution to the opioid crisis. I have ongoing concern that the COVID-1 9 pandemic will dispropor- tionately affect populations with sub-stance use disorders. There is an ur-gent need for us to examine COVID-19 risks and outcomes in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD), particular-ly among homeless and incarcerated individuals. Additional attention needs to be given to the risks of reduced ser-vices, such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Beyond these social risks, there are several plausible biological mechanisms for potentially worsened outcomes in patients with OUD who contract COVID-19. I maintain my enthusiasm for my work by not sw eating the small stuff, hang- ing out with enthusiastic people, eat-ing well (thanks to my wife's culinary talents), and constantly not allowing \"perfect\" to be the enemy of \"good. 11 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022 A PASSION FOR FOOD... BY VIBHA GUPTA, MD (RES '16) I had the courage to find my place not only as an emergency physician but also as an advocate for social justice.\" My time at NYU-Belle- vue was formative. While learning the practice of emergen-cy medicine, I was simultaneously receiving a different kind of education from my attendings and co-residents working on the most challenging problems in our society. Under the guidance of Dr. Goldfrank, I had the courage to find my place not only as an emergency physician but also as an advocate for social justice. In 2016, soon after graduating, I moved to the W est Coast (Bay Area) to take a job as an emergency physician in Oakland, California. This was, the year that President Trump was elected, and years in which we saw xenophobic rhetoric take form into the horrific policy of child separation. We saw, images of children in cages, mothers deported, families left in limbo. I was not only personally outraged, but as a physician I saw how this was adverse-ly affecting my patients. There were horror stories about un- document ed patients being intercept- ed on their way to the hospital or just after emergency surgery. The tension, anxiety and fear in the community was unmistakable. I saw a patient in his 50s brought in by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in cardiac arrest who did not seek treatment be-cause he was worried that the hospital 12 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022Top Right: A dancer from Gamelan Sekar Jaya performing a traditional Balinese dance.

His sister lamented that he had chest pain for weeks. This patient survived, but after treatment he was discharged with an ejection fraction of 20 percent. Fear is a pow-erful barrier for immigrant healthcare, and it is precipitating a public health crisis. Growing up as a second generation Indian Am erican in the midwest, I have experienced my fair share of xenophobia and racism. That shared history makes me feel more connect-ed to the communities that I serve. It pains me to see that fear has taken root in immigrant communities and forced families to make impossible choices. Does a mother take a sick child to the doctor and risk deporta-tion or does she stay home? Does one go to work when there are immigra-tion and customs enforcement raids ongoing or stay home? Does one sign up to get the COVID-19 vaccine or not because of fear of disclosing personal information? These patient encounters stayed with me as I co ntinued working in the emergency department. I started to feel the urge to do something more to address the root of the problem. I had also been struggling personally to find my place after leaving Bellevue, a place where no one is turned away and diversity is treasured. Then on 13 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022We are obligated as healthcare providers and conscientious citizens to combat xenophobia and systemic racism.\"November 22, 2018, while watching the Trevor Noah special on Netflix \"Son of Patricia,\" I had an epiphany. Trevor in his usual comedic style talked about race, immigrant identity, and food. He offered a suggestion to his audience: \"I feel like there should be a rule in America, the y should say, you can hate immigrants all you want, but if you do, you don't get to eat their food. Y eah? That's a fair exchange to me. Y ou hate immigrants, no immigrant food. And when I say no immigrant food, I mean no immigrant food. Nothing. No Mexican food. No Caribbean food. No Dominican food. No Asian food. Noth-ing. Only potatoes. And I'm not even saying flavored potatoes. I'm saying plain potatoes. No spice. Because no immigrants, no spice. Don't ever forget that. Both figuratively and literally, no spice.\" At that moment, the nonprofit No Im- migran ts, No Spice (NINS) was born. I resolved to give voice to the voiceless, by bringing t he community together to celebrate our diversity through one common language, food! Having lived in New Y ork City, I became a seri-ous foodie. I love food - the taste, the process, the history, the ethnography, the ethnobotany, and the different food ways of \"American\" cuisine. So many of us love and enjoy the foods of immi-grants and don't even realize it. NINS is a 501(c)3 nonprofit that shines a light on t he contributions of immi- grants to our social fabric - seeking to change hearts and minds. We work to flip a narrative in the media that vilifies and demoralizes immigrants, while simultaneously raising funds to defend the rights of people in migra-tion and to educate and empower. Our first campaign, #BBQwithoutbor- ders, brough t together six Bay area chefs not only to share their cuisine, but to discuss their journeys as immi-grant chefs and explore their cultures 14Attendees at the #bbqwithoutborders event. EMalumni DC-06/22/2022through dance, art and of course food. The Flamenco, Bhangra, Balinese and Street dancers were breathtak-ing. The art exhibit \"Immigrants are Us\" celebrated immigrants and their contributions to our communities in a myriad of ways, through their crea-tivity, innovation, entrepreneurship, and hard work. #BBQwithoutborders celebrated BBQ in the form of barba-coa tacos, Iranian sweet-sour chicken wings and Indonesian Ikan Bakar grilled seafood. The event attracted more than four hundred attendees and was featured on the San Francisco Chronicle. One hundred percent of profits ($12,000) went back into the community. Additional campaigns throughout this year ha ve highlighted the plight and contributions of undocumented restaurant workers and immigrant farmers during COVID-19. It is out-rageous that many of our essential workers who are undocumented can-not access the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Through NINS we have been raising funds to keep undocumented folks housed, fed and safely sheltered in place during the pandemic. During the 2020 election we ran an educational campai gn on the history of voter suppression in LatinX, Asian American and Black communities. The campaign, called #eatvotelove was all about the foods, the history of voting rights and community organiz-ing in these demographics. All funds raised from the campaign went to the organization When We All V ote. Our newest campaign will elevate tra- ditional postpartum wisd om as a form of postpartum justice for Black and Indigenous mothers. We will run an educational campaign in partnership with a group from UC Berkeley and raise funds for the delivery of nutri-tious meals from immigrant chefs to at risk postpartum women served by the East Oakland Roots Clinic. Coming full circle, over the last year I conducted a speaker series o n immigrant health and was tasked to create a policy to e xpand \"Safe Spac- es\" within our hospital campuses to protect all patients seeking healthcare. I was proud to be a voice at the table to successfully advocate for a written policy that has been disseminated throughout our regional network at Kaiser Permanente. We are obligated as healthcare pro- viders and conscien tious citizens to combat xenophobia and systemic rac-ism not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it affects the health and wellbeing of us all. If COVID-19 has a silver lining, it should be that we are all mortal and our words and actions impact the most vulnerable people in our communities. I am invested in this work, heart and soul. It is my social mission.

BY MANA KASONGO, MD (RES '06) During the first weeks of the surge of COVID-19 in the emergency department, I coded a 60 something year old African American man who had COVID-19. It was in the middle of the night. He was an ICU hold. The nurse noted the patient's heart rate was dropping, so she came to me. I was the only doctor in the hospital. By the time I got there, he was in asystole. We commenced CPR. We resuscitat-ed him for a brief time. Then we lost his pulse again. We were not able to get him back. He died alone. When I asked about contacting his next of kin, I found out that he was the last of a family of three to die. His wife died a couple of days before him. The patient's sister-in-law died two weeks before her. They all died alone. I work at a 200 bed hospital in the heart of South west Georgia. As of 2019, The total population of the county where the hospital is located was about 22,000 people. It's three and a half hours from Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia, Birmingham, Alabama, and Tallahassee, Florida. It's breathtakingly beautiful, surrounded by pine trees, farmland, and hunting plantations. It's in the heart of what is known as the Blac k Belt, the place where enslaved people were forced to pick cotton until the end of the Civil W ar. Despite our violent history, our divisive politics, and our r egions' geographic isolation, as a Black woman who has lived in New Y ork, Chicago, and Bos-ton, Southwest Georgia is surprisingly progressive. I live in an integrated neighborhood. Half of the emergen-cy physicians where I have worked have been Black or Latino, including the ED director. Black people here are relatively prosperous, and, dare I say, happy. Some of them even own property. As I write this essay, COVID-19 has claim ed more than 200,000 souls. Essentially, it's as if the rural county where I work has died 10 times. The thought overwhelms me. It means that it's not entirely impossible for entire rural populations to die without anyone noticing, to die as alone as the 60-year-old man and his family. When COVID-19 first arrived in the US in January 2020, I h ad soothed myself with the thought that our geographical isolation would offer enough protection to at least give us enough time t o prepare for the arrival of the virus. That did not happen. The virus arrived with such brutality in Southwest Georgia that we became national news. In April, the coroner of Dougherty County, Michael Fowler, made the cover of Time magazine. The photo showed him in the morgue, dressed in full personal protective equipment\u2014gowned, double-gloved, face obscured by goggles and N95 mask. In the story, Fowler said the virus \"started spreading at a couple of funerals. Those individuals who attended the funerals went back into their neighborhoods, homes, and churches, and more people were infected. It hit like a bomb.\" Meanwhile, the hospital employees went through years of personal protective gear in six months. It was overwhelming. The doctors and nurses, along with techs and staff were dealing with a deluge of COVID-19 patients on a daily basis. Before COVID-19 detonated, I had been in cont act with some friends from New Y ork who are emergency physicians. They told me what symptoms to look for, how to be prepared to surge your emergency department, and how to prepare for the emotional stress 19 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022the pandemic would inflict. I took everything they said seriously, and did my best to fortify my staff and myself. When the virus did arrive, despite our best individual efforts, we were unpre-pared simply because a rural hospi-tal cannot adequately prepare for a global pandemic without a strong and active public health infrastructure. My first COVID-19 case happened in the middle of March. I was working the night shift by myself when a fifty-some-thing year old African American woman, who worked as a nurse at the nearby marine base, arrived in the ED. The patient had fever that lasted for two days, so she was sleep deprived and dehydrated. She had only urinat-ed twice in 24 hours, had no cough, fatigue, and, body aches only when her fever spiked. Her oxygen satura-tion was 100 percent on room air. She had felt well enough to go to work that day but chose not too because of her fever. Not feeling any distress, she sat comfortably in the recliner. I took a thorough history: had she recently traveled to Asia, Seattle, New Y ork, or Europe? No. Had anyone in her home been sick? No. She lived alone and had no visitors for nearly two weeks. All she did was go to and from work. Had she been in contact with anyone with the novel COVID-19? She said she didn't think so. Then she remembered that three days before she had taken care of a veteran with COPD. He came into the office, coughing persistently. It was a dry hacking cough with a fever. \"He looked terrible,\" she said, \"worse than normal.\" Had either she or the patient worn a mask? Y es, but she couldn't remember if she had kept her surgical mask on the whole time. He kept removing his mask because he coughed so badly he would vomit. Her workup was completely normal. Her labs and chest X-ray were normal, and at that time she had no fever because she had taken ibuprofen shortly before she came in. Her arterial blood gas was normal, her influenza and strep swabs were negative. But, she had lost her sense of smell. 20Dr. Kasongo in full protective gear outside her hospital waiting for another ambu- lance with a presumed COVID-19 patient. EMalumni DC-06/22/2022I recommended a COVID-19 swab. She agreed and I told her it would be sev-eral days before she got her result. In the meantime, I sent her home with an albuterol inhaler, azithromycin, vita-min C, and zinc sulfate, strict self-isola-tion orders, and gave her the Amazon link to get a portable pulse oximeter. If her oxygen level dropped lower than 92 percent, she was to come immedi-ately back to the ED. Three days later the director of nursing told me that this patient was positive for COVID-19. We called her with the result. She was shaken by the news, but she felt well. The fever had subsided, and she was not in any respiratory distress. She felt she had gotten through the worst of it. When I got back to work after having a few days off, our respiratory ther-apist told me the patient came back the day before and had to be admitted for bilateral pneumonia. They had intubated her overnight for worsening respiratory distress. She remained on the ventilator for over three weeks, with multiple attempts in between to wean her failing. Ultimately, she survived and was discharged after six weeks in the hospital. Seeing my first COVID-19 patient wor- ried me as i t did my colleagues and friends in New Y ork City. But unlike them, I had a deeper reason to worry outside of the coronavirus. Unlike New Y ork City and places in Seattle that got hit really early and hard with this vi-rus, I felt I was in a part of the country that, well, how can I say this delicate-ly? No one cares about. I learned that painfully when the recession of 2008 hit the country and most bounced back as if nothing happened, certainly New Y ork City and Seattle came back with a vengeance. Southwest Georgia, not so much. Too many companies to enumerate including Cooper Tire and Merck left town and many industries just closed and didn't return. I was further reminded of our insignif- icance bet ween 2017 and 2019 when this region was hit with tornadoes and hurricanes this region has never seen. In January of 2017, I was eight months pregnant. Right after New Y ear's, an EF1 tornado and straight-line wind s knocked down trees and powerlines, paralyzing the city. So many trees had fallen around our house that for the first and only time in my career, I couldn't get to work. We had to temporarily relocate to a hotel room for two weeks since we didn't have power. At least our house was still standing. Some of our neighbors weren't so lucky. If that wasn't bad enough, three weeks later a series of tornadoes swept across southern Georgia that made a bad situation worse. As a result of a bureaucratic snafu amongst local, state, and federal officials many people went weeks without power. In September of 2017, Hurricane Irma struck. In October of 2018, Hurricane Michael struck the Florida panhandle as a category five hurricane. By the time it reached Albany, 90 miles inland, three and a half hours from the Florida gulf coast, it was still a category three hurricane. That's never happened before. Each of these extreme weather events caused extensive emotional and economic damage that only deepened the effects of the recession, increasing the all too real sense that Southwest Georgia could be forsaken if it meant preserv-ing the economic well-being of those fortunate enough to live in big cities. In addition, to the economic woes and extr eme weather events Southwest Georgia was already dealing with a patient population that is sicker than their counterparts living in cities. According to the CDC, \"people who live in rural areas, are more likely than urban residents to die prematurely from all of the five leading causes of death: heart disease, cancer, uninten-tional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke.\" If you're black and living below the poverty line, these disparities are compounded. Add to this, the fact that last flu season was the worst in a decade for children. It's hard not to feel a sense of despair as we look forward to what may be a long winter ahead. Y et even with my sense of pessimism, I could n ever have imagined such a When the virus did arrive, despite our best individual efforts, we were unprepared simply because a rural hospital cannot adequately prepare for a global pandemic without a strong and active public health infrastructure.\" 21 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022I don't see those smiles. I do not shake hands anymore. Our interactions now seem distant.\" horrible bungling of the worst pan- demic in 100 years. This is the most advanced and richest country in the world. We should be able to contain this virus? We can't. We aren't. We should certainly be able to mitigate this? No. We can't. What are we doing?It appears several regions in the country are playing a game of whack a mole with the virus. After my first patient, we saw a steady rise in COVID ca ses, usually people who worked in Albany, GA or had been around a family member in Albany. I expected this. I didn't expect Florida to remain open for spring break, and provide a setting for a super spreader event. Suddenly, our small hospital had to handle an influx of people from out of state who were traveling up and down I-75. Then fast food workers started to arrive in the ED since all of these revelers were stopping at nearby local fast food res-taurants to be fed while on their way home. Then I started seeing patients who work at the numerous meatpack-ing factories and farms coming in with COVID-19 symptoms. No matter what walk of life these patients came from, most of the people I intubated or placed in the ICU with the worst man-ifestations of COVID-19 are Black and Brown people. I realized very early on in this pandemic that the dire morbidi-ty and mortality was disproportionate-ly impacting Black and Brown commu-nities. The pandemic had become an X-ray that exposed all of the fracturesof a society that has relegated genera-tions of Black and Brown people to themargins of society, resulting in limitedaccess to healthcare, education andhousing. As with all issues related to race, the intersection ality of race and the coro- navirus is multifactorial. First, a majori-ty of minority people work essential jobs that don't allow them to work from home. This includes meat pack-ers, janitors, grocery store clerks, bus drivers, mailmen and women, med-ical assistants and certified nursing assistants especially in nursing homes, and healthcare workers, to name a few. Second, because of structural and system ic racism in the delivery of healthcare and allocation of health-care dollars, minority people have baseline chronic medical problems that the coronavirus takes advantage of such as morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease and lung disease. Third, because they are essential workers but generally low paid hourly wage earners, if they do not work, they do not get paid. Few get paid time off, so many of them contin-ued to work despite either knowing or suspecting they had the coronavirus. And certainly, most of them did not re-ceive hazard pay for working through a pandemic. Additionally, since 60 percent of all Black Americans live in the South, we could deduce that this virus was going to wreak havoc in southern, rural communities such as mine. And the numbers bear this out. As of this writing, Georgia has had 300,000 cases and about 6,500 deaths. Florida has had 699,000 cases and 14,021 deaths. Alabama 151,000 cases and 2,491deaths. At the beginning of April, the state of Georgi a closed to make sure the state wouldn't overwhelm hospitals with COVID-19 cases. It worked. Georgia began to reduce its transmission rate. Fewer people got sick. Then less than a month after closing the state, church-es, gyms, bars, tattoo parlors, and hair and nail salons were allowed to open. Transmission rates hadn't dropped for 14 consecutive days as the White House Coronavirus Taskforce recom-mended. The opening also coincided with new data that showed what I had already witnessed - Black and Brown communities were getting sick and dying while white communities remained comparatively less affected. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I understood that the virus didn't dis-criminate. It was an equal opportunity destroyer. Now, I understood that pub-lic health policy can discriminate, and, for a region like Southwest Georgia, it may ultimately seal its fate. Soon after the reopening, we were overw helmed with cases. Our ICUs 22EMalumni DC-06/22/2022filled with COVID-19 patients, suspect- ed and confirmed. We held patients in the ED. Sometimes we had no choice but to go on diversion and not accept any ambulances from outside the county. It was a devastating but nec-essary decision for a critical access hospital such as ours. We had surged as much as we could. There was just no more space. COVID-19 patients stayed on ventilators for weeks, so ICUcapacity remained a problem. After several staff members fell ill, we were required to wear PPE at all times with an N95 mask. We have 12-hour shifts which are really close to 14 hours. We went hours without drinking, eating, and feeling like we were suffocating under our masks. One day, in the middle of my shift I called my husb and in tears. It was a particularly bad day. COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were coming into the ED fast and furiously. I had not had a second to take off my mask except for 30 minutes before my shift was over. I was angry that I was thirsty. My lips were actually stuck together. I told him I wasn't sure I should even go home. I didn't want to expose my family to this virus. I knew doctors who were staying in their garages, or in hotels because the risk of transmis-sion felt too great. I know a friend who sent his young family away for months because of this virus. How could I go home? My husband was in the middle of calming me down, when the nurse bangs on my call door, and tells me yet another patient in respiratory distress was coming in. So, I had to cut him off, and attend to this patient. It was a somber drive home that night. I was scared t o go home. I thought about just renting out one of those extended stay hotels, but I have a three-year-old daughter and a seven-year-old son who already don't see enough of their mom. I just knew that the psychological impact of them not seeing their mom, and knowing how deadly this virus was would only lead to more fear on their part. This ques-tion of whether or not to even go home has plagued me since the beginning of the pandemic. My husband signed up to be mar ried t o an emergency phy- sician who had crazy and long hours, and a super stressful job. He did not sign up for possibly getting a deadly disease from me. My children, Marshall 7 and Malaika 3 in a tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who played Black Panther, the first black superhero to be portrayed on the big screen. My job has become a nightmare of sadness, fear, and anger. Before the pandemic, I enjoyed my interactions with my patients. That doesn't happen anymore. I don't want to be a vector of disease for my patients or vice versa. So the conversations about where you come from, who your people are, and where you go to church don't happen anymore. I don't entertain anymore questions about where my name comes from or where my accent is from. I used to hug my well-known patients. Some of them are like old friends. There's one patient I see so of-ten I once told her that I saw her more than my own kids. These are the mo-ments tha t make what I do worth it. It's the smile you get or the high five you get from a child who feels better. That's ended. The pandemic stole these moments from me. I don't see those smiles. I do not shake hands anymore. Our interactions now seem distant, just from a public relations point of view, with the 6 feet of distance rule. My profession that I love, have sacrificed so much for, and took years to master, has changed seemingly overnight. Just that thought saddens me. Now, I find myself often thinking of planning an exit strategy out of the profession. 23As the spring became summer, and now summer has turned to fall, and more states have reopened. The com-munity has appeared to accept the pandemic as normal or think it has ended. Our pastors who used to EMalumni DC-06/22/2022Mark has been my supportive husband for 8 years.

Silently, quietly, and easily without much fanfare.\" pray with us at the beginning of the pandemic stopped coming. Patients seemed shocked when staff greeted them with full protective gear. One patient seemed particularly offended with my PPE. She asked me why I was dressed like I was \"going into space?\" Did I think she had something? I said no. I didn't necessarily think she \"had anything,\" but that Georgia COVID-19 cases had reached community spread, so we had to presume everyone had it. She seemed confused and added, \"Oh, that's still going. Coronavirus is still here?\" I am an immigrant. I know how un- certaint y feels. I know what it is like to not know how the future will bear out. I know what fear is. I am from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central Africa, called Zaire when I was born, a place that has been mired in civil war for too many years to count. I lived on the south side of Chicago in Hyde Park before it became gentrified and white and when we as school kids would be chased and terrorized by El Rukn gang members. I went to middle school in Liberia during the time of Samuel K. Doe, a dictator so brutal that 24EMalumni DC-06/22/2022when he was caught by rebel forces, he was tortured and killed. I went to high school in Massachusetts, easily the most racist state I've ever lived in, full stop. I volunteered in Haiti four days after the devastating earthquake of 2010 and experienced multiple aftershocks while I was there. I also traveled to Kenya with my husband after contentious elections and high levels of ethnic hostility. I say all of this to emphasize that I don't scare easily, and I don't get discouraged easily, and I will not be intimidated. But COVID-19 is bringing me to my knees and it is intimidating. It has changed how I view the future for myself in the field of medicine and the future of my chil-dren and America. All of this defies reason. We are the United S tates, the most powerful and resourceful country in the world. I always thought that we can do any-thing. I was totally wrong. Instead of mobilizing the country to help Black and Latino people who were making up about 60 percent of all COVID-19 deaths, our president took to Twitter to exhort his base to \"liberate\" states that had shut down to protect themselves from a virulent pathogen that was kill-ing its citizens. To add insult to injury, armed militias stormed state capitals demanding states reopen, ignoring mask mandates. Factory owners and politicians bow to quarterly earning reports and 24 hour news cycles that, no matter how much they report on COVID-19, cannot persuade enough politicians to help our grandparents who live in assisted living centers and our children who are back in school. What was instructive to me, through a recessio n, and several \"once in a lifetime\" extreme weather events was how rural America can be aban-doned. Silently, quietly, and easily without much fanfare. Y ou are left to your own ingenuity. Y ou're left with all the risk, no matter how brutal the disaster or how merciless the novel zoonotic virus is. Y ou. Are. On. Y our. Own . When I think about what will happen to Southwest Georgia after this pandemic, it's done through the prism of these experiences where good, hard wor king people would have no recourse against some entity that they never saw coming. This is not a trivial point. Just as we are seeing \"once in a lifetime\" wind, water and fire events happen every week, it's not out of the question that we will have another \"once in a lifetime\" pandemic and, sooner than every hundred years. What happens to rural, Black and Brown communities everywhere who are skating by already on the thinnest of resources. What happens when we leave it all to chance? What happens when we as a society decide to substi-tute \"luck\" with public health policy? Are we all to be damned if we aren't in New Y ork, Chicago, LA or some place that \"matters?\" As of right now, I hesitate to answer because I need to believe we are better than who we have been since the pandemic started. Note. Since this writing, over 600,000 peo-ple have die d from COVID-19. While numbers are going down, and vac-cines more available, the transmission rate is still very high in several states. 25 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022WE FOR WE, NOT ME FOR ME BY TARA SOOD, MD (RES '10) 26 EMalumni DC-06/22/202227 Medical Yurt provided medical assistance to the thousands of peaceful protesters at Standing Rock Indian Reservation, North Dakota.. My first Global Health patient experience was a 50-year-old woman with a past medical history of asthma who presented with several days of a dry cough and shortness of breath. Hearing wheezing on exam, I grabbed an albuterol Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) from an old lunch box filled with a few medications and handed it to her explaining instruc-tions for use. Surprisingly, she handed it back to me. Assuming her concern was regarding side effects, I explained that they were minor and that the benefit outweighed risk. She smiled at my misunderstanding of her intentions and responded, \"I trust you, doc. I just don't want to take it because you don't have that many. Save it for someone who needs it more, like an elder.\" In almost a decade as a physician, this was the first time I experienced a pa-tient refuse medicine that they needed in order to save it for someone who might need i t more. Over the ensuing weeks, I saw people habitually bal-ance the needs of the community with their own. My first patient interaction wasn't an anomaly, but the norm at Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota. At its peak in 2016, almost 15,000 people gat hered in Standing Rock to peacefully protest the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on tribal land. The police and private security forces hired by the oil conglomerate, Energy Transfer Partners, responded with firing tear-gas, rubber bullets, and even water cannons at people in -20\u00b0 conditions. In response, indige-nous tribes from around the worldsent representatives to Standing Rockto stand in solidarity with the Siouxtribe. One of them, a Sami wom-an from Norway, came to me withabdominal pain that I suspected wasappendicitis. A dozen people volun-teered to drive h er to the nearest ED, an hour and a half away. All of them chose to stay with her until she was discharged after surgery. In Standing Rock, I wasn't caring for patients alone. People in the community were active and willing participants in patient care. They felt a responsibility to care for others. Routinely, patients I saw would stop by to drop off supplies they wanted to share, or to clean the space, or to shovel snow outside the medical yurt. Although most return visits were to bring me food daily, stemming from the elders' deep concern about the perceived lack of \"meat on my bones.\" Since Standing Rock, I have worked interna tio nally over a dozen times. I view Standing Rock as my first global health experience because it was worlds apart from my conventional practice. However, I didn't truly appre-ciate the effectiveness of community EMalumni DC-06/22/2022\"Resuscitation tent at Gallup Indian Medical Center (GIMC), New Mexico.\" For the first time in its history, M\u00e9dicins San Fronti\u00e8res/ Doctors Without Borders (MSF) deployed teams within the United States to the Navajo Nation.\" 28 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022engaged care until recently, in the midst of this pandemic. COVID-19 struck the Navajo Nation early and viciously. Navajo Nation is a Native American territory that extends into the states of Utah , Arizona and New Mexico, covering over 27,000 square miles. It's roughly the size of West Virginia and home to roughly 180,000 Navajo people (aka Din\u00e9). The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in mid-March 2020. By its peak, in May, Navajo Nation had the highest rate of COVID-19 cases per capita in the Unit-ed States. Y es, higher than New Y ork. Several socio-economic factors acc elerated the spread of COVID-19 through this community. As most Na-vajo people live in multi-generational households, in dwellings limited to one or two rooms, isolating or quarantin-ing is an impossibility. Approximately 30-40 percent of Navajo people donot have running water, which makesfrequent hand-washing a challenge.Nearly 60 percent live without accessto the internet and 10 percent livewithout electricity, limiting the abilityto disseminate educational informa-tion or public service announcements.Since there are only 13 grocery storesin an area the size of West Virginia,access to nutritious food is severelylimited. COVID-19 underscored thispre-existing lack of basic needs andinfrastructure. I knew little about these deficien- cies when I st arted volunteering in New Mexico at the Gallup Indian Medical Center (GIMC) emergency department located on the border of the Navajo reservation. The ED had only 13 beds, separated from each other with plastic sheets. Capacity was stretched with outdoor tents for stable patients. The acuity was high with only a handful of specialties available in-house. Throughout my time there, the hospital was full and all admissions required transfer to other cities. We alternated transfers be-tween Albuquerque or Santa Fe, NM and Phoenix, AZ. If two members of a family became significantly ill with COVID-19, they generally ended up being admitted to hospitals in different cities, sometimes 480 miles apart. What' s worse, there was no efficient system in place to transport patients back to Gallup after their discharge. At times patients transferred to Albuquerque attempted to walk or hitch-hike 140 miles to return home, but ended up returning to our hospi-tal with rhabdomyolysis, heat stroke, and renal failure. Patient area of the GIMC ED.Despite the hard-work and dedi-cation of the staff who take great pride in serving the Navajo people, its healthcare system is chronically deficient. Indian Health Service (IHS) is the federally funded agency responsible for providing health-care to Native Americans. In normal times, IHS is so underfunded it only spends one-sixth of what Medicare spends per patient. IHS facilities are understaffed by an estimated 25-40 percent. This chronic negligence is reflected by the almost four times higher rate of diabetes, double the rate of obesity, and a 5-year lower life expectancy than the general US population. During the pandemic, the negligence was more striking. When the Seattle Indian Health Board asked the Federal govern-ment for PPE and other supplies, they were mistakenly sent a box of body bags. The nations, separate from the state government, were ex-cluded from funding in the first draft of the federal Coronavirus Air, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This delay lead to additional challenges getting COVID-19 test kits, supplies and establishing isola-tion, quarantine, and contact tracing activities. IHS even received masks not approved for medical use! Given the lack of basic needs, infrastruc-ture, and adequate healthcare, it's no surprise that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection per capita in the country. For the first time in its history, Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) deployed teams within the United States to the Navajo Nation. Academic institutions such as Mas-sachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) also sent teams of 29 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022 ... the Navajo nation had a mask mandate with near 100 percent compliance. Navajo leaders acted swiftly with a shelter in place instituted three days after the first case.\" volunteers to Navajo Nation. On my first day in Gallup, I experi- enced a snip pet of the qualities that are the basis of the Navajo response to the pandemic. On my way to my first shift at GIMC, my car stalled. Before I could panic, strangers came to my aid and got my car functioning. Before I could make it to the nearest auto shop, my car stalled again and another group of strangers helped me get to the auto shop. Although her sched-ule was full, the mechanic agreed to repair my car the same day when I told her it was my first day in Gallup, and I didn't know anyone in town who could help me. The owner of the shop drove me to my shift and picked me up after my shift. When I thanked him for hi s kindness, he responded \"you are here for us, we are here to takecare of you.\" In spite of all the challenges the Navajo people f ace, they successfully flattened the curve. In March, even with the politicization of mask wearing, the Na-vajo nation instituted a mask mandate with near 100 percent compliance. Navajo leaders acted swiftly with a shelter in place order three days after the first case. It was followed by a strict 57-hour weekend curfew which remained in effect until August when it was shortened to 32 hours. Although they have the strictest lockdown in the country, severely limiting mobility Night shift power nap. 30 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022to obtain food and water, there were no protests against the orders. There has been widespread acceptance that people must tolerate inconvenience and loss for the community to survive this pandemic. Adding to the prompt public health interventions of the Navajo leaders, there was mass grass-root mobili-zation. Local businesses house and feed people. When COVID--19 positive patients are discharged from the hos-pital and sent to designated motels to isolate, community organizations paid the bill, and provided a visiting doctor and food delivery. The Navajo youth grassroots programs delivered food, water, and cleaning supplies to elders on the Reservation so they can shelter in place. The Navajo Nation have set up their own fun draising campaigns, to which the people of the Republic of Ireland famously made donations. In 1847, while the Choctaw people still suf-fered because of the Trail of Tears, they extended kindness to the Irish people suffering from the Great Potato Famine by donating $170, equivalent to $5,000 in today's money. The Irish people reciprocated this kindness by donating almost $5 million to the Navajo COVID-19 Relief Fund. All theseefforts successfully flattened the curve despite rising rates of infections in surroun ding states. W arned by the experience of the Navajo Nation with COVID-19, other tribes across the Unit-ed States instituted policies to protect their people before COVID-19 infec-tions occurred in their communities. I attended a lecture by Dr. Shaquita Bell, a P ediatrician at Seattle Children's Hospital, when she spoke about the preventive measures Native American communities in Seattle had taken. One community organized for the young and healthy to do all shopping for the elderly. They mandated masks, set up screening check points for anyone entering the community, and routinely tested high risk individuals. By the time of Dr. Bell's lecture in late July, the community had zero cases of COVID-19. Dr. Bell's conclusions coincided perfectly with what I had witnessed in Standing Rock and the Navajo Nation: \"My people have sur-vived genocide and multiple pandem-ics. We will survive this one too. We have almost 100 percent compliance with masks, we take care of each oth-er, and we protect our elders. Because in our culture, it's we for we, not me for me.\" People of the Navajo Nation, have much to t each us. Despite all the defi- ciencies in infrastructure and health-care, the Navajo successfully flattened the curve because of immediate pub-lic health interventions, and commu-nity compliance, due to their shared values, summed up as \"we for we.\" It is worthwhile to learn from a people who live by values rooted in their culture for generations. There are numerous ways to incor- pora te this value system into our personal lives, our practice, and our departments. Working in solidarity with the Navajo people is one way. Give of your time and skills by vol-unteering for humanitarian groups working with the Navajo Nation, such as Project Hope. Develop a program at your institution to facilitate volunteer-ism by physicians at IHS hospitals, like that of Brigham and Women's Health Care Outreach Program. If you are invested in residency or fellowship training programs, arrange off-service rotations for residents and fellows on Indian Reservations. For those who want to contribute financially, Commu-nity Outreach and Patient Empower-ment Program ( copeprogram.org) is a Na vajo run organization providing housing for quarantine and supplies. Since 30 percent of the Navajo people live without access to running water, consider supporting a Native organi-zation such as W ater W arriors United (collectivemedicine.net) or Navajo W a- ter Pr oject (navajowaterproject.org ). Fo r anyone who wants to act in soli- darit y with Native Americans, there is no lack of opportunities. I was fortu-nate to be able to share my time and skills with the Navajo people and I left with valuable and long-lasting lessons to live by. The people of Standing Rock introduced it to me and the Navajo showed me how effective a communi-ty-based response can be in curbing a pandemic. I left Gallup believing the way for our country to stop losing thousands of lives to COVID-19, is to adopt and practice \"we for we, not me for me.\" EMalumni 31Tara in front of makeshift patient rooms created with plastic sheets at theGIMC ED.

EMalumni DC-06/22/202233MY JOURNEY TO WILDERNESS MEDICINE BY CARLO CANEPA, MD (RES '16) What about wilderness medicine in Costa Rica? asked Dorothy. \"That sounds dumb,\" I said bluntly. Like all of my best ideas, this one came from my then girlfriend and now wife. We were third year medical students planning our fourth-year electives. Jay Lemery (RES '04) was putting on a two-week course in wilderness medicine in Costa Rica. We both had no idea what it was about, but we fig-ured that two weeks in the jungle and on the beach would make for a great elective. Eight years later, wilderness medicine is an important part of my career. Few people who end up in the field of wilderness medicine planned it that way. Many of us stumble across it by chance and stay. It requires a willingness to go slightly against the grain and take a chance on something different. Through my own journey I hope to give some insight into this somewhat nebulous field and hopeful-ly inspire the current residents. I was born in Lima, Peru, and immi-grated to the United States when I was 4 years old. M y family fled a Maoist uprising called the Shining Path, which wreaked havoc on our lives through car bombings, power outages, and terrible inflation. We landed in New Y ork City. I spent my elementary school years attending P .S. 116 and living in Stuyvesant town, just a few blocks from Bellevue and NYU hospi-tals. We were not an outdoorsy family in the traditional sense. We traveled and went to the beach, but my parents were not the type to choose to sleep outside in a tent and suffer. That was not part of our immigrant experience. I did not go on an actual hike until I was an undergraduate at Columbia University. It's never too late to start. The more I traveled, the more I fell in love wi th hiking, camping, and spending time outdoors. At the same time, I was figuring out that I wanted to become a physician. How could I blend the two? At first, I was inspired by Dr. Paul Farmer and the Partners in Health model. I researched malaria prevention and treatment while stud-ying abroad in Madagascar. I volun-teered at an HIV/AIDS clinic in Rwan-da, distributing f ood during a summer break in college. During medical school at Cornell University, I spent a summer in Zwedru, Liberia, with cur-rent NYU EM resident Peter Luckow (RES '23), conducting research on the effect of community health workers on HIV and Tuberculosis outcomes. By the time I finished medical school, I was somewhat burned out on global health and had a hard time imagining a career that could give me all of the things I was looking for \u2014 doing good in the world, and enjoying the process. It was at this time that we went on our electiv e to Costa Rica \u2014 thanks to my wife's foresight. It was a new and liber-ating experience. Although we were in the jungle and on the beach, it was no picnic! We took classes in the saturat-ed humidity, ran a lot of simulations in the field, improvised splints and casts and litters, and learned about disease processes we had not come across during our medical training. The most exciting part was learning leadership skills while leading a team during multi-person casualty scenarios in a EMalumni DC-06/22/2022low resource setting. It was the first time as a medical student that I felt like I had some autonomy in a high-stress environment and thoroughly enjoyed the process. It was an eye-opening ex-perience that boosted my confidence and made me excited to learn more. I returned home from that experience intent on incorporating wilderness medicine into my career. During residency, there isn't a lot of time to take electives and pursue one's interests, especially if you're focused on another equally interesting field like ultrasonography. Our residency had excellent mentors and opportu-nities for ultrasonography and fewer opportunities to pursue wilderness medicine. It was not a topic that came up often and even less so as a serious academic pursuit. I spent most of my elective time conducting ultrasound research, teaching ultrasonography, and going to national conferences to compete in \"Sono Games.\" I spent most of my vacations hiking, camping, and climbing. After residency, I even com-pleted an ultrasound fellowship at the Mount Sinai and Elmhurst Hospitals. But in my mind, I always knew that wilderness medicine was going to be a part of my career. I had too much fun during that elective to let it slip away. I completed my wilderness medicine fell owship at the Massachusetts Gener- al Hospital (MGH) / Harvard Medical School in 2018. The year-long pro-gram included working in the MGH ED as an attending physician for half of the year and spending the other half pursuing a variety of trainings and experiences in the field. There is no one way to practice wilderness medicine. Everyone picks one aspect and focuses most of their time in that area. For example, one might focus on high altitude physiology, expedition medicine, or dive medicine. Others might focus on a specific sport like ultramarathons, mountaineering, or white-water kayaking. Or you can be-come a medical director for a national park, a non-governmental organiza-tion, or an expedition outfitter. The possibilities are truly endless. There is no one path. This fellowship gives you a year (o r more) to hone your skills, network with others in the field, be exposed to the various opportunities, and decide on your career and the life you wish to create for yourself. One could pursue the same training and opportunities without a fellowship, but I imagine it would take at least several years to end up at the same place. The benefit of a wilderness fellowship is that it condenses the timeline. During my fellowship year, my coursew ork included taking a moun- taineering course on Mount Rainier in W ashington State, being part of a medical team on a weeklong ultramar-athon in the Utah and Arizona deserts, and taking an avalanche safety course on Mount W ashington. I became an Advanced Wilderness Life Support (A WLS) instructor and led a 3-day course in Boston for local physicians, residents, P As, NPs, and medical students. I was the first author for a publication on the use of ultrasound in austere environments and contributed wilderness medicine cases to a case files textbook. I also participated as a volunteer for the annual MedW AR wilderness medicine competition for residents at ACEP . It was a busy, but fun year. The highlight was spending three mon ths volunteering with the Him- alayan Rescue Association (HRA) of Nepal in the Everest region. I was stationed at a high-altitude clinic in the small town of Pheriche (14,341 feet or 4,371 meters), which is on the route to Everest Base Camp where moun-taineers attempt to summit the tallest mountain on Earth. For three months I lived out of a sleeping bag, without running water, a week's walk from the nearest road, and surrounded by the stunning beauty of the Himalayas. Along with two other British physi-cians and three Nepali staff, we took care of approximately 500 patients and gave free daily high-altitude talks to hundreds more. We saw patients with wide ranging illnesses including high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), high-altitude pulmonary edema I lived out of a sleeping bag, without running water, a week's walk from the nearest road, and surrounded by the stunning beauty of the Himalayas.\" 34 EMalumni DC-06/22/202235Carlo performs a lung ultrasound as part of a high altitude physiology research study. EMalumni DC-06/22/2022(HAPE), acute mountain sickness (AMS), snow blindness, frostbite, ac-etazolamide-induced myopia, respira-tory and gastrointestinal infections, and pregnancy. We made night calls to surrounding villages to meet patients who were carried on stretchers by porters across rocky terrain. The majority of our patients (around two thirds) were Nepali guides, porters, cooks, and tea hut staff. We charged foreign tourists a premium to be seen and treated in order to subsidize the cost of the local patients. I also con-ducted an ultrasound research project screening for asymptomatic pulmo-nary edema in trekkers as they as-cended to Everest Base Camp. I, along with 4 research assistants\u2014including two NYU-Bellevue EM alumni Julia Paris (RES '18, US '19) and Michael Shamoon (RES '18)\u2014scanned over 200 participants across altitudes ranging from 8,000 to 17,000 feet, inside tea houses and guest lodges. What does one do after completing a wildernes s medicine fellowship? My wife and I decided to spend a year living on an island in the western Pa-cific called Saipan, which is part of the Northern Mariana Islands, a common-wealth of the United States (Western Pacific Ocean). We both felt that after a dozen years of training in New Y ork and Boston and each completing two fellowships that we needed a change of pace. We worked at the only hos-pital on the island, Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation. She was the only psychiatrist on the island, cover-ing inpatient, outpatient, adult, child, and consult services. I was one of five emergency physicians. It was an opportunity to learn about marine en-venomation, dive physiology, drown-ings, and other tropical diseases. But we also had the opportunity to serve a desperately underserved population of Pacific islanders including Chamor-ros, Carolinians, Yapese, Chuuk, and Micronesians. There was no MRI ma-chine, very few consult services, and limited available interventions. Many patients had to be evacuated to other islands like Guam and Hawaii and to other countries like South Korea and Carlo demonstrates how to use a Gamov bag to simulate descent for patients who are ill with high altitude illnesses. 36Carlo closes a scalp laceration in the middle of the night using a headlamp during a multi-day ultramarathon in the American southwest. EMalumni DC-06/22/2022the Philippines for definitive care. Our son, Theodore, was also born on the island of Saipan. It was an amazing opportunity that blended emergency medicine and wilderness medicine. After a year, we decided to return slightly closer to home. We moved to Anchorage, Alaska. I currently work as an EM staff physician at the Alaska Native Medical Center, a 173-bed level 2 trauma center that is part of the Indi-an Health Service. I primarily treat the members of over 200 tribes that make up the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. We see over 60,000 ED visits each year. We have a large urban homeless population that we serve. We also take phone calls from over 180 villages around Alaska that are not connected to the road system, from the north slope to the far reach-es of the Aleutian chain. We provide telemedicine guidance to community health aides in the villages while making decisions about helicopter and fixed wing medical evacuations to Anchorage, all while managing the ED. We treat bear attacks, seal bites, botulism, frostbite, snow machine and all-terrain vehicle (ATV) related trauma, as well as alcohol and drug dependence, domestic violence, and penetrating trauma. I truly love my job because it com- bines ser vice to a greatly underserved community while incorporating wilderness medicine into my daily routine. And I get to live in the great state of Alaska. In the future I do plan to return to academia, but for now, I'll continue to cross country ski, fat bike, pack-raft, mountain bike, ice climb, pick berries, dodge bears, moose and lynx, fish for halibut and salmon, mountaineer, ice climb, and run on snow and ice. 37There was no MRI machine, very few consult services, and limited available interventions. Many patients had to be evacuated to other islands....\" EMalumni DC-06/22/2022My maternal grandmother and grandfather were my first link to Bellevue and the notion that geriatric meant interesting.\" MICHAEL STERN, MD EMalumni 38 DC-06/22/2022LEARNING SECRETS: HEARING STORIES OF AN AGING POPULATION BY MICHAEL STERN, MD (RES '05) I have always thought older people were intriguing. Even from a young age, their words were passports to journeys I had yet to undergo. I found their aging faces and bodies fasci-nating. They spoke of experience, hardship, and triumph. A permanent limp was the result of singular time and place and context, a scar had a story, a lined face was the roadmap of a long-lived life. As a kid, I felt they knew secrets that I didn't even know existed. As I have grown, older peoplestill seem to me to hold the keys that unlock wisdom. I was reminded last year of why I love emergen cy medicine as a specialty and, in particular, geriatric emergency medicine as my academic interest. While working weekends, holidays, and late into the night has never been my favorite part of practicing emer-gency medicine, feeling like I am part of the team prepared to take care of anyone at anytime with any issue has remained an ongoing privilege. It still feels a s if we, emergency medicine providers, represent the ultimate safety net for our community --- the initial guards of the frontline. So while sleeping in and having a leisurely Sunday breakfast with my family is always preferable, I continue to get deep satisfaction from being in the emergency department (ED) on a Sunday morning with my work family, ready for anyone who walks or rolls in. That ethos was central to my time at NYU-Bellevue during residency. I, like so many others, stand on the shoulders of giants like Dr. Goldfrank and the outstanding faculty that made up the Bellevue guard. At 8:02am, in walked a 97 year-old woman w earing a terrific hat. She had a lower leg cellulitis that developed after sustaining an abrasion from a fall a few days ago. She was the definition of \"younger than her stated age\" and plucky, to say the least. I asked her what caused her fall. She stated mat-ter-of-factly that she tripped because she wa s engrossed in a conversation with a younger friend in his 60s. They were on the same walking tour through Central Park to explore the extraordinary trees. I was impressed and immediately felt admiration for her. As I asked her about her medi-cal history, I noticed she had tissues tucked underneath the sleeve of one of the arms of her shirt - exactly like my grandmother used to do. \"I have no medical history, if you mean condi tions,\" she said with a little sauce in her voice. \"Do you take any medications on a dai-ly bas is?\" thinking that another angle of information gathering would yield results, as it often did. \"I take a multivitamin and a baby aspi-rin, but that' s only because my doctor says I should. I disagree, but I humor him,\" she said with a wry smile.\"Do you still work?\" I asked, fully ex-pecting the answer to be Y es! I was hooked and wanted to know more about this fantastic woman. She 39 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022replied that she was a book editor and stopped working in her 80s so that she could spend more time doing other things. \"When was the last time you were in th e hospital?\" I ask, realizing that I was talking to someone who was the epito-me of the actuarial paradox. The longer you live, the longer you are going to live. She had no medical problems and was much more likely to live to 105 years old than my children or even future grandchildren. If she had advanced heart disease, COPD, diabetes, or cancer, it would have likely ended her life already. She was unfettered by disease. Her genes and lifestyle certainly played central roles. How fortunate was she! I thought it might be something to have time to talk with her over a meal, to hear her life story. But that wasn't in the cards.\"Sit down young man,\" as she patted the end of her stretcher. I obliged. When a 97 year-old woman asks you to do something, you do it.\"The last time I was in the hospital, th is hospital, was over 65 years ago for the birth of my third child. And I don't intend to stay now. I think I need antibiotics, and I will be on my way.\"\"Y es, ma'am.\" I said, with a big smile. She smiled too. I discharged her with a prescription for antibiotics and instructions for follow up. I won't soon forget her. As is often the case, family has influ- enc ed my story. My grandmother, my grandfather, and my father have all played key roles in my journey to med-icine, emergency medicine training at NYU-Bellevue, and my ultimate focus on geriatric emergency medicine. When I decided to switch gears from being an arti st to becoming a medical student at the age of 33, my motiva-tion was personal. I had grown up admiring my dad, a psychiatrist, and respecting that he deeply loved his work. But it was a vivid memory when I was thirteen of traveling to the ED with my father while he was having a massive heart attack that kept coming back to me. Seeing medicine in action in the ED in those pivotal moments wh ile the doctors and nurses saved my father was profound. The immeas-urable impact that they had on his life stayed with my siblings and me. But I had also never forgotten the fear, powerlessness, and ignorance I felt, and I never wanted to feel the same in the face of another crisis, especially since I was expecting my first child. The tipping point occurred in my art studio in Soho. While looking at one of my abstract paintings - I had been working for years on the theme of natural rhythms - I realized I had been painting, in essence, variations on my father's electrocardiogram rhythm on the monitor that I was glued to on that singular winter night long ago. My father did his internship training at Be llevue and loved to regale me with stories about the ED and the \"Psych W ard.\" He always said it was one of the most thrilling and fulfilling periods of his life. But my maternal grandmother and grandfather were my first link to Bellevue and the notion that geriatric meant interesting. They were in their 60s and 70s, respectively, when I can recall my first memories of them. My maternal grandmother, Gladys Finl ayson, was born in 1911 in New Y ork City. Donna, as I called her, was raised from the age of five by her own grandmother, Miranda Peachie, the widower of an Episcopalian minister. As a young woman of 18, Gladys be-gan her training as a nurse at Bellevue Hospital. Her favorite ward was Q4, a large room with expansive windows and a breathtaking view overlooking the East River. This was where all the indigent men were placed. She felt it represented the beautiful essence of Bellevue, and she loved it. She recalled the sharp looking nurses' uniforms --- pressed white cotton with collars, pleats, and hats --- that she wore, feeling grownup and important for the first time in her life. During a night shift, she was carrying a tray of glass test tubes filled with blood when she spotted a tall, handsome doctor round-ing the corner down the hallway. He was speaking with a southern drawl. When was the last time you were in the hospital?\" I ask, realizing that I was talking to someone who was the epitome of the actuarial paradox.\" 40 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022She instantly dropped the tray and the test tubes crashed to the ground, shattering around her. \"It was instant love!\" she wistfully recounted to me when I was young. My grandfather, Kyle Hill, was born in 1898 in Heidenheim er, Texas. He was chief resident in pediatrics at Bellevue. He had grown up \"dirt poor\" as he lat-er told me. To help out his family, as a child he picked cotton before he went to school. He fled Texas as a teenager and \"rode the rails\", living on trains all over the south. After settling in New Orleans and having several successful years as a professional gambler, filling his time with his fair share of liquor, music, and romance, (his vagabond life, as Donna described it), he trans-formed himself into a medical student at Tulane University and ultimately became a beloved pediatrician on Long Island. He had a home office next to their living room and always accepted homemade apple pies and fresh eggs as payment for his medi-cal care if the parents couldn't afford to pay him. A seemingly 180-degree turn from his former life, this chapter lasted over 40 years. He cared for several generations of kids throughout his long career. I remember he had a drawl, smoked like a chimney, had a double-barrel shotgun hidden beneath the stairs, loved word-play and the creative side of language, and helped my grandmother raise yellow roses in their garden. He practiced medicine until he was nearly 70 years old. My grandmother was always up for an adven ture. Donna wore yellow tennis sneakers in the snow and learned how to ride a bicycle in her 40s. She enjoyed cold beer in a glass in the afternoons on special occasions, whispered \"Horrors\" when she was appalled or felt the impulse to curse, and never said an unkind word about anyone ever. She wore a mink coat, drank mint juleps at the Kentucky Der-by with my grandfather, and preferred silence over gossip or boastful pride. Donna kept rubber bands around her wrists (\"They are handy!\") and tissue tucked in her sleeves, like the 97 year-old patient I described at the beginning of t his piece. In her pocket book, she kept birthday candles because \"you never know when you may need to celebrate!\" Y ears after my grandfather died, she moved to California in her early 70s and drove the sun-drenched highways around Pasadena in her yellow Ford well into her 80s. When I visited her out there during college, she told me how she had studied hard for her California Nursing Recertification Exam. She had recently passed and now was volun-teering as a nurse. She read the New Y ork Times from cover to cover in her nursing home into her nineties, and she always smelled like roses when I hugged her. She suffered a fall that re-quired a hip replacement but bounced back, despite the predictions. In her last year, she had senile dementia that caused her memory to slip away from her on most days (although she would have moments of razor clarity almost until the end). She couldn't remember all of our names so she gracefully referred to her grandchildren and great grandchildren as \"my kittens.\" She came as close to dying of \"old age\" as is humanly possible. I admired that. To me, it exemplified her fortitude and grace, and was divinely fitting for her. She died in her sleep at the age of 96 with no significant medical problems except, perhaps, for a pathologic love of oxtail soup and chocolate, which she ate, at times, back to back. I bring my grandparents back to life now to m ake a point. In their later years, they were not simply geriatric patients with senile dementia and COPD. They were people who led interesting lives, full of character and color, idiosyncrasies and peccadillos, joys and triumphs and tragedies. They had stories. Remembering this is the key to appreciating older patients. It is what continues to intrigue me about meeting them and feeling honored to take care of them in the ED. Despite the often times complex nature of their presentations, the management chal-lenges that exist around their treat-ment and disposition, and the time that older patients require to work-up My grandmother, Gladys Finlayson who I called Donna. 41 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022as the ED continues to swirl around you, they are worth it. Older patients continue to teach me about medicine and life. In medical school, I deliberately started ea ch rotation with the mind- set that I might just choose this area for my specialty, even if I knew that it wasn't true. As a distinct strategy, I would try to fake myself out, believing that I would learn more about every rotation this way. But I knew deep down that emergency medicine was for me. I loved so many of its aspects --- the societal safety net as the front porch/door to the rest of the hospital; the energy and hum; the variety of patients and pathology; the acuity; the procedural components; the cama-raderie among ED staff; the stories of the patients who present during a bad moment or, sometimes, on the worst day of their lives; and the chance to do good and occasionally save a life. It was Dr. Lewis Goldfrank who specifically in spired me to come to NYU-Bellevue to train in emergency medicine. His philosophy of emergen-cy medicine and the role emergency physicians play in society, often caring for those most vulnerable and med-ically underserved, was what drew me to train there. I reveled in learning the craft of EM by some of the world's most talented emergency physicians and teachers. Caring for the diversity of patients in every domain - socioec-onomic, ethnic, racial, cultural, sexual orientation, and age - was thrilling and humbling. It was a true theatre for humanity; sometimes circus-like, and often dramatic, unexpected, and poignant. I was particularly fond of the homeless population who became familiar faces that I warmed to quickly. I believe the entire team of providers in the ED saw them as I did: diamonds in the exceptional rough! We were Goldfrank's disciples, after all. But I was particularly drawn to older pa-tients because I experienced them as vessels of life experience. It is as if they were books, sometimes dusty and age-worn, with many chapters to delve into. I found them fascinating. My fellowship training in Geriatric Emer gency Medicine (GEM) was the brainchild of Dr. Neal Flomenbaum, a leader in emergency medicine for decades and a visionary in his ability to see the need for this specialty train-ing. He created a first-of-its-kind GEM fellowship at New Y ork Presbyterian/Weill Cornell with an interdisciplinary focus that combines comprehensive clinical, research, and education-al experience. My GEM fellowship training has allowed me to develop an understanding of the complexities and specific needs of the increasingly large geriatric population. I have gained a different skill set and particular strat-egies to best care for them in the ED, often enabling them to return home to resume their independent lives, and sometimes providing specific com-fort in their final moments. With the tremendous support of Rahul Sharma, a fellow classmate and friend during EM residency, and now the Chairman of Emergency Medicine at NYP/Weill Cornell, I have the continued oppor-tunity to teach what I have learned to the next generation of emergency physicians, as well as contribute to a growing body of research focused on older emergency patients. I find my work extremely satisfying. This is not the forum for statistics or pedantries. T here are lots of articles, texts, and on-line resources to learn about the stats of the \"silver tsunami\" of geriatric patients that began hitting the shores of our EDs in 2011 (as the baby boomers started to come of age and cross the threshold of sixty-five), or about the multi-factorial geriatric syndromes and the core geriatric emergency medicine competencies. 1 The saying that \"geriatric patients are not just older adults,\" the clever corollary to the adage that \"pediatric patients are not just small adults,\" is true. It encapsulates the uniqueness of this group, as well as the need to learn how better to care for them. The strength and vulnerability of our older patients are characteristics they share with the medically underserved patients who originally drew me to NYU-Bellevue's EM residency pro- My grandfather, Kyle Hill. 42 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022People are living longer, better, and with more co-morbidities than ever before.\" gram. And like them, caring for the elderly is both rewarding and chal-lenging, in equal measure. In sitting down to write this piece, much ha s changed in medicine and, specifically, in emergency medicine, since I started this medical journey nearly 25 years ago. And those chang-es are more pointedly significant at this current, scary moment in time. As advancements in healthcare-related technology, education, and pharma-cotherapy have increased, people are living longer, better, and with more co-morbidities than ever before. But the impact of COVID-19 on the elder-ly is stark. Age is an independent risk factor for a more severe disease course and worse outcome. This is a direct result of normal physiologic changes associated with aging that affect every organ system, including the immune response. Certain co-mor-bidities are independent risk factors as well, and most on the COVID-19 list exist with higher prevalence in the elderly. As well, the devastating losses that have occurred in the congregate setting of nursing homes and long-term care facilities are staggering. The mortality rates for the elderly are shockingly high. During the height of the pandemic in the early spring, discussions were beginning to take place nationally about the rationing of resources. Geriatricians, emergency physicians and medical ethicists were quick to respond that age alone should not be a criterion for withholding care. We still have much to learn about car-ing for all patients with COVID-19. The elderly certainly deserve our focused attention. The elderly population in our coun- try ha s suffered from the unfortunate phenomenon of ageism for a long time. In my opinion, there are many reasons for this: the dissolution of the multi-generational family, the loss of a sense of community as urban living has prevailed, the American spirit of rugged individualism born from youthful adventure, westward expansion, capitalism's philosophy of a person's worth to society as meas-ured by the job they do and how much inco me they generate, the blooming of nursing homes as the first and only op - tion when infirmity sets in, and a lack of appreciation for the value of the currency of wisdom gained from life experience. As a result, older people have been relegated to the edges of our society. It is alarming and uncon-scionable. The future of healthy aging is contin- gent o n many things, on both micro and macro levels. Continued progress in healthcare literacy and lifestyle choices, technology and pharmaco-therapy, access and preventative care, as well as education and research within the medical community, is of paramount importance. Emergency physicians must lead the charge, as we have often done in the past. Im-proved GEM education and training, geriatric specific clinical protocols and guidelines, environmental/physical modifications to our EDs, and dedicat-ed research will help. But if we take note of our older patients' humanity, their stories, their complexities, their gifts, we will truly be able to care for our elders in the manner they so rich-ly deserve. 1 Hogan TM, Losman ED, Carpenter CR, et al.

Pain management and MICHAEL MOJICA, MD (PEM '93) July 1st 1991 was my first entrance to Bellevue as a newly minted pediatric emergency medicine fellow. I had just done all of the things that they tell you not to do at the same time, but seem to go hand in hand with a career in medicine. I had gotten married, moved and changed jobs in the preceding two weeks. This was an interesting time to be at Belle-vue. My start coincided with the start of the EM residency with such illus-trious emergency medicine interns as Jeff Manko and Pediatric interns as Dennis Heon to work with. That makes me feel old. I had a lot more hair and a slimmer waistline back then (I could say the same for both of them). I was not exactly sure what a PEM fello w was supposed to do or exactly what the field of emergency medicine entailed. Only one of my medical school classmates had become an EM resident. Sometime during my second year of my pediatric residency, I found an announcement in the back of a journal for Pediatric EM fellowships program that I didn't know existed until then. The pediatric emergency room (yes, it was only a room and not a department then), was chaos personified. Supervision was at a minimum and you learned on your own or not at all. Somehow, I came to think t hat this chaotic, challenging environment was a perfect mix for my need for order and calm. No one tried to talk me out of it. It wasn't until much later that I realized that creating calm and order out of chaos was the part that I enjoyed. Without challenge, there is no reward (that is not a Y oda quote). My fellowship started with a bang (literall y). My first shift was with Dr. Michael Tunik on July 4th at a time be-fore Rudy Giuliani had convinced the population of New Y ork City that blow-ing parts of themselves off with illegal fireworks was not a good idea. It was also a time of peak gun violence in the city. Y ou were guaranteed at least one or two stab or gunshot wounds every Friday and Saturday night and this was when we only saw patients less than 18-years old. The two years of fellowship flew by, and befor e I knew it I was a new faculty member and a year later the Pediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM) fellowship director. Knowing what I know now, I was significantly overcon-fident of my skill set at the beginning. Over time you develop a finer appre-ciation for the multitude of things you don't know. I often wish I could go Michael Mojica at the Institute for Innovation in Medical Education (IIME) Symposium in 2019. 46 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022back in time to talk to my younger self. I would tell him to be humble. Medi-cine has a way of humbling you if you are not. I would also tell him to start doing yoga before our body falls apart, buy Apple stock when it was four dollars and kill the guy who invented the tie. I'm pretty confident that my younger self would not have listened to a word I said. I would like to tell you that my career was perfectly planned and I hit every goal on my timeline but that would be a complete lie. I never had a plan. I still don't. Many of the skills that I've developed came from my inability to convince others to teach the fellows the things they were supposed to learn. I developed my skill set adding critical appraisal, statistics, research des ign, teaching the teacher and simu- lation to my tool box. I drew the line at ultrasound and quality improvement. I was older and crankier then, and had learned how to say no. Flash forward to the present time. On Octo ber 1st, 2019, I officially stepped down as fellowship director after 25 years at the helm (insert Star Trek reference here). It wasn't an easy de-cision. For the longest time, I thought I would be happy to retire as a fellow-ship director. I loved being a fellow-ship director. I loved my fellowship family. To this day I think of my fellows as my grown-up children that I didn't have to pay college tuition for. I am just as proud of their accomplishments as I 47am of my daughter Lia's. Unfortunate-ly, the ACGME has sucked all of the fun out of being a fellowship director and I got tired of filling in check boxes that don't mean anything. I now get to teach the fellows without the annoying administrative part. If the early part of my career was focused o n content and curriculum development, I am now in the dissem-ination phase. I've published a critical appraisal curriculum on MedEd Portal (I've called it M*E*S*S for the Making EBM Simple Series because no one told me that I couldn't). The PEM Guides and PEM CARS iBooks are a time sink, but help to maintain my evidence and knowledge base. This April I published a PEM Simulation Case iBook.

Me.\" EMalumni DC-06/22/2022A CONVERSATION WITH CORITA GRUDZEN, MD ALUMNA, CLASS OF 2005 Corita is vice chair for research, Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emer- gency Medicine, recently named assistant dean for clinical sciences in the Of- fice of Science & Research (OSR) and deputy director of the Clinical & Trans- lational Science Institute (CTSI), NYU Langone health. Corita was ranked as the No. 2 NIH-funded emergency medicine investigator nationally for 2019. What does being named one of the leaders in funding nationwide mean to you and the research division? It is an incredible accomplishment that has been a true team effort. Our faculty, administrative team, and research staff have all contributed in a myriad of ways to achieving this huge milestone that ultimately reflects our commitment towards improving the health of our patients and communi-ties. Stephen W all was the first faculty member to obtain an R01 grant in our department. From there, Kelly Doran, David Lee, and Ryan McCormack all went on to receive K awards and successfully navigated the \"K-cliff\" to transition to R-level funding. Our success would not have been possible without the help of our division admin-istrator, Ada Rubin, our grants man-ager, Senem Suzek, or the research coordinators and data associates who translated each project \"dream\" into a reality. Support from the department chairs (Dr. Goldfrank then Dr. Femia), true collaboration with the clinical operations leadership, and finan- cial support from central research administration were also critical. That being said, sustaining our success and grant funding will be our next and greatest challenge! We have been able to add many key new team members in finance (Daniela Sanchez) and administration (Denisha Brand-ford, Noah Klein) who are crucial to running research smoothly! And, of course, thank you to our research staff, data analysts, and project managers without whom none of this would have been possible! I imagine some may end up as emergency providers and researchers themselves. What does it mean, as a woman in emergency medicine, to be named the Assistant Dean of Clinical Sci- ences? It has been wonderful to bring all I have learned in emergency medicine to bear in this new role. It cannot be overstated how much I use my ability to triage, problem solve, and multi- task in this new leadership position. I believe emergency providers are es- pecially suited for roles in large, com- plex health systems because of these carefully honed skills. As far as being a woman in a leadership position, I am acutely aware that I am standing on the shoulders of the women who have come before me. While I have had both male and female mentors along the way, it is the female role models that have made me feel that obtaining this type of position is actually achiev-able. What was the toughest hurdle you overcame in your career? I think rejection is the hardest part of research, and shouldn't be underes- timated as a barrier to longevity. It is challenging for researchers to work for months on a grant proposal only to have reviewers reject it, often without the correct expertise or a thorough review. The constant rejection can make you really question your ability and ideas; but, in the end, I truly be-lieve it makes success all the sweeter! What are the greatest challeng-es encountered by researchers during COVID-19? For many clinician-investigators, it has been challenging to balance our desire to help in the clinical are- 48 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022A CONVERSATION WITH CORITA GRUDZEN, MD ALUMNA, CLASS OF 2005 While I have had both male and female mentors along the way, it is the female role models that have made me feel that obtaining this type of position is actu- ally achievable.\" 49na with our need to push our own research agenda forward. There are already many obstacles to patient recruitment into clinical trials, but COVID-19 has caused these barriers to grow exponentially. Our doggedness as researchers is being tested more than ever, as well as our creativity in addressing all the threats to complet- ing our research projects. Even while caring for patients clinical- ly and managing their active projects, many of our researchers immediately pivoted to leverage their expertise to- wards COVID-19 related research. Dr. David Lee, for example, rapidly transi- tioned to studying therapeutics to treat COVID-19, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and I have worked to use our existing clinical trials networks to rap-idly deploy screening and treatment modalities. It has been inspiring to witness the research community come together to address this global public health challenge What advice would you give to young researchers? Research is a marathon, not a sprint. Research is all about the long game; it is quite laborious and the fruit doesn't grow until many years later. Y ou have to have real passion for a topic, a patient population, or a specific methodology to persist when no one else seems to think your ideas are worth pursuing. It is, in my opinion, a remarkably rewarding career but has a lot of highs and lows. It is not for everyone. EMalumni DC-06/22/2022CARING FOR SYSTEMS THAT CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS BY MD (RES '16, QSPI '17) 50 EMalumni DC-06/22/202251 EMalumniI fully appreciate how profoundly that fellowship year shaped my current practice.\"I vividly remember the start of my Quality, Safety, and Practice Innovation (QSPI) fellowship. I was scheduled to meet with Silas Smith, (RES '06, MED TOX '08) director of the division of QSPI, for our first formal didactics session and was working my way through hundreds of pages of National Health Services docu-ments from the UK, wondering what I had gotten myself into. Choosing to pursue a safety fellowship was easy; over the course of residency I realized that my interest in what goes wrong with patients naturally extended into understanding what goes wrong with patient care systems. And while this fellowship was certainly far more challenging than the decision to pursue it, the year flew by, and I came out on the other side with a wealth of theoretical and practical patient safety knowledge, a Masters in Public Health, and the confidence to start my new role at New Y ork Presbyterian/Colum-bia University Irving Medical Center, as the associate director of quality improvement and patient safety for the emergency department. Much of my day-to-day work involves re viewing cases of near-misses or patient harm. The safety fellowship provided me with the tools and expe-rience to do this work in a structured and objective manner that looks to address systems' issues rather than assign blame. Having learned about a variety of theoretical frameworks and approaches to patient safety has provided me with the core knowledge and flexibility to customize my ap-proach depending on the issue. Equally important was the experience of l eading and participating in a vari- ety of committees and projects such as rapid improvement events. Learning to lead and work effectively with in-terdisciplinary teams is a critical skill required to translate patient safety issues into effective countermeasures. Analyzing data, understanding how to measure impact, and critically assess-ing research were all key components of fellowship training. This practical experience as a fellow was further augmented by the formal MPH course work that included research methodology, health eco-nomics, statistics, management, and program evaluation. Being able to test and apply the concepts covered in my coursework to my fellowship and bring back fellowship experiences to the classroom was invaluable in devel-oping the skills required to lead teams and work towards meaningful impact in patient safety and quality. During fellowship, I had the opportu- ni ty to teach and present on patient safety topics to a full spectrum of learners from medical students rotat-ing through the ED to grand rounds at another institution. Teaching patient safety concepts in a variety of venues during fellowship not only helped solidify my own knowledge, but gave me the opportunity to integrate patient safety into bedside clinical teaching. Now with a few years of experience und er my belt, I fully appreciate how profoundly that fellowship year shaped my current practice. The Ken-neth & JoAnn G. Wellner Patient Safety and Quality Fellowship provided the foundation for success in my current administrative position, influenced my role as an educator, and left me with a more nuanced understanding of my own individual clinical practice. Whether caring for an individual pa-tient or thinking about patient popu-lations as a whole, every encounter is framed in the context of the system, and improving care for all patients. Note: On January 1, 2021 Liliya was pr omoted to director of quality and patient safety at Columbia Unifersity Medical Center for the emergency department. Congratulations! DC-06/22/202252 EMalumniMy Journey to Patient Safety BY TONATIUH (TONA) RIOS-ALBA, MD (QSPI '15) DC-06/22/2022My journey to being the first ever Quality, Safety, and Practice Innovation (QSPI) fellow at NYU-Bel- levue began during my last year of residency. I was as yet undecided about what I wanted to do after finish-ing residency - I enjoyed many things within emergency medicine and my interests were wide including admin-istration, education, and ultrasound. I considered doing fellowships in each of these subspecialties but none of them alone fit exactly what I wanted to do. The one thing I was sure about was that I wanted to find a niche that would provide me the opportunity to practice academic medicine but more importantly, give me the free-dom to combine all my interests while providing a clear path to advance my career. In a way, this uncertainty about my career is what opened the path towards the safety fellowship - I was not convinced by any of theother subspecialties on their own andhad decided to simply apply for anattending job. It wasn't until late in thefall when I received an email from myresidency director outlining a new fel-lowship at NYU-Bellevue. To be honest,I did not know very much about whatpatient safety entailed, but the fact thatit was a growing field within emergen-cy medicine was definitely somethingthat attracted me to this subspecialty. I was intrigued enough by the pros- pect of t he fellowship that I decided to apply and was very excited to be offered an interview soon afterwards. I was unsure what to expect of my visit, this being a brand new fellowship in a field that I was not too familiar with as yet. However, any doubt I may have had about the fellowship quickly disappeared upon arriving and learning about the position. It all started with Silas Smith (RES '06, MED TOX '08) director of the division of Quality, Safety, and Practice Innova-tion, making me feel right at home, and explaining his vision for the fellowship. He made it clear he had certain broad goals in mind, but that he wanted to incorporate all my interests into the training and shape it into the fellow-ship I had envisioned. After learning th at this new subspecialty had the potential to incorporate my interest in quality improvement, academics, and operations, it seemed as if it had been created just for me! At that point I was convinced it was the perfect fit. Once at NYU-Bellevue, I was happy to lear n that all my expectations about the fellowship not only came true, but were exceeded. I of course learned plenty about the history of patient safe-ty in medicine, the process of quality improvement, ED operations and ED management. I was surprised at how much exposure I got to other fields including simulation, residency educa - tion, medical school education, faculty development, ultrasound QI, obser-vational medicine, amongst many others. Through the fellowship, I also participated in many multidisciplinary projects and worked with leader-ship from other departments such as trauma surgery, OB/GYN, internal medicine, and hospital administration. Last but not least of all, the exposure to leadership across the hospital and the connections that I was able to make with those leaders were an invaluable part of the training that prepared me well to become a leader myself later in my career. Upon finishing the fellowship, I mo ved to Cleveland, OH, to be with my wife, where she was completing her residency in anesthesiology. I was very excited to get a job at the reputable Cleveland Clinic. It was there that I fully understood the true value of this fellowship. Less than a year after getting there, I applied for and attained the position of associate quality improvement officer for the entire Institute of Emergency Medicine for the Cleveland Clinic, which then encompassed 13 different emergen-cy departments. This was a highly coveted position that I was able to secure over other more experienced physicians, thanks in no small part to having completed the quality, safety and practice innovation fellowship. Once having taken on the new role, it became very apparent to me that the training I received was invaluable and allowed me to succeed. The most difficult p art of this role was trying to incorporate the needs of the differ-ent disciplines I dealt with on a daily basis, whether it was ED leadership, hospital operations, hospital admin-istrators, or department chairs, all of whom may have different viewpoints on any given subject. I understand the importance of always holding patient safety as the number one goal - in the end everyone can always agree that ensuring patient safety is our most im-portant role and from there the tasks become less daunting. Reminiscing about my time as a fellow brin gs back many pleasant memories of the people I got to know at NYU-Bellevue. I will be forever grateful to Silas Smith for allowing me the opportunity to train under his tutelage at such a great institution. I would encourage any emergency physician looking to advance their career in the area of patient safety and quality to consider joining the NYU-Bellevue family and pursuing this fellowship. It will not only prepare you to transform your practice but will provide you with an unforgettable experience you will cherish for the rest of your career. Ensuring patient safety is our most important role and from there the tasks become less daunting.\" 53 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022SAFETY FELLOWSHIP REFLECTION BY MATTHEW MCCARTY, MD (RES '18, QSPI '19) As an emergency physician, I have the privilege of inter-acting with people daily. These personal interactions are the primary reason I went into medicine. The diversity of these interactions in the emergency department (ED) is the reason I chose emergency medicine as my specialty. I have always sought to have a broad-er impact, to move beyond individual patients to improving the delivery of healthcare in the ED and beyond. The Kenneth & JoAnn G. Wellner Fellow-ship in Emergency Department Safety and Quality uniquely positioned me to lead quality improvement and patient safety initiatives. Working with Silas Smith, (RES '06, MED TOX '08) director of the division of Quality, Safety, and Practice Innovation, provided me with a fundamental toolkit I use both in my administrative role as the director of Quality Assurance at Weill Cornell and in my clinical work in the ED. By emphasizing human factors and system s theory, the didactic pro- gram of the fellowship has shifted my approach to problem solving. When appr oaching medical errors, it is easy to focus on human error and blame the front-line provider. Why wasn't the resident more careful when per-forming the procedure? Why didn't the ED doctor think of an epidural abscess when treating that patient with back pain? This fellowship gave me a new perspective on the complex-ity of these events. By analyzing the web of factors that influence any one bad outcome, systems solutions often present themselves. By moving away from blaming individuals and looking for ways to fix the systems in which our ED colleagues operate, I am better able to develop solutions that have broad impact and hopefully prevent similar errors from occurring in the future. Silas' approach to patient safety is meticulous ly driven by data. Using data to identify a problem, analyz-ing where potential fixes exist, and proving that your solution is working, were fundamental elements of the fellowship. The rapid iterative cycles that we employed when approaching 54By emphasizing human factors and systems theory, the fellowship's didactic program has shifted my approach to problem solving.\" EMalumni DC-06/22/2022Matthew McCarty, (RES 18, QSPI '19). problems during my fellowship at NYU-Bellevue served me well in my new role at Weill Cornell, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Faced with the prospect of an overwhelming surge in patient volume, we had only a few days to create a home discharge program for moderate risk hypoxic COVID-19 patients presenting to the ED who otherwise would likely have been admitted to the hospital. The impor-tance of attention to detail, rapid tests of change, and use of data allowed me to help spearhead creation of a telehealth follow up program to ensure that our discharge program provid-ed high quality care and was as safe as possible given the circumstances we faced. The rapid redeployment of non-ED physicians into this tele-health followup role presented quality assurance challenges that could only be solv ed through strict adherence to data driven processes and outcomes. These were all measures ingrained in me during my fellowship. Data con-tinues to drive my quality assurance work both in defining the problem, testing the effectiveness of any pro-posed solution, and assuring that any gains are maintained over time. In addition to the robust didactic pro- gram, Sil as ensured that the fellowship has broad experiences in relationship and team building. By encouraging me to become involved in projects beyond the ED across the enterprise, he emphasized the importance of early involvement of all stakeholders. One of the major projects during my fellowship was the creation of a spinal emergency protocol to streamline and standardize the approach to patients presenting to the ED with concern for spinal cord compression. This involved relationship building with multiple other services including ra-diology, neurosurgery, and neurology. This hands-on approach to consensus building during my fellowship laid the groundwork for all the interactions I now have with my colleagues both within and outside the ED. These lessons have been critical in my work to establish a robust ED followup pro-gram at Weill Cornell. Involving nurs-ing, advanced practice provider, lab, radiology, and telehealth leadership at the start of the process and seeking their input with each step of the rollout has helped to ensure a smooth rollout of this program. The Kenneth & JoAnn G. Wellner Fell owship in Emergency Department Safety and Quality has opened doors and has helped to define the course of my career in EM. This invaluable experience with Silas' mentorship influences everything I do to protect patient safety and advance quality healthcare. 55 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022A GLIMPSE INTO ELLNESS 56 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022A GLIMPSE INTO WELLNESS EMalumni 57 DC-06/22/202258 MAGAZINE A portrait of \"DAMILOLA\" by Michelle Romeo 58 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022\"DAMILOLA\" Oluwadamilola Idowu (Damilola), MD, is one of our socially responsible emergen-cy medicine residents graduating in 2022.

She titled the email \"Reflecting on recent events and the loss of black lives.\" This email started a conversation about systemic racism and racial disparities in public health. Damilola, brought to the forefront the need to \"call out r acism in America as a public health issue.\" She challenged her coworkers to acknowledge that \"we do not practice medicine in a vacuum.\" The portrait of Damilola was done on the da y our residency, hospital, and community came together to mourn the black lives lost for incomprehen-sible reasons. Residents, faculty and staff gathered to pledge to make to-morrow better while supporting each other in the moment on that day. I was inspired by Damilola, a fellow female physician who is underrepresented in medicine and all who advocate for social justice. 59 EMalumniWe do not practice medicine in a vacuum.\" MICHELLE'S ART Art was something I fell into, I realized I had a decent hand at it when I was younger. I wish I could say I do it all of the time, but with the realities of medical school and residency, it falls by the wayside. I hope to continue working on my art, not only for others but for myself. Every time I pick up a paintbrush or pencil I relax in a diffe- rent way and remind myself I should be dedicating more time to the hobbies that help me balance.

How can a man be ruled by a lask? Falling into an abyss and falling so fast, Into this horrid spell that life itself cast. Started with a drink or two - no different from the rest, You worked for it all and felt so blessed. I don't even know when you lost control - When it con- quered your mind, body and soul. That luring bottle - so full of deceit, I curse that dreadful day you chose to meet. Now, I look into your eyes and feel such shame, With guilt and pain but no one to blame. You're dancing with misery with each sip, Ruining your days, you keep boarding its ship. Powerful and canny - it will throw you out to sea, With nothing at all, not a chance to plea. Take a look in the mirror, you're falling apart, Shedding tears and breaking heart after heart. Its wretched claws holds on so tight, Taking away hope and outing the light. But, this is a cycle we can together end, Whatever is broken can surely mend. Take my hand and let us pull through, We want you back and want the real you. This deep emptiness - a hole in my heart, I want a happy father and want a fresh start. EMalumni 61 DC-06/22/2022STAND-UP CO MDS BY ANDR\u00c9S DARIEN SUTTON-RAMSAY, MD, MBA, (RES'19) BWhen Darien and I first started our comedy show Doc-tors Without oundaries the goal was to create something that made people laugh while educating them about stigma-tized topics in healthcare. Now, our only goal is to become so famous that we get sued by Doctors Without Bor-ders\u00ae for trademark infringement. The show structure is simple. We start off wit h workplace insults that we have accumulated over the past month. Here is one such example: When I asked an inebriated patient wher e he was headed during his third attempt to elope, he responded with \"To visit your mother.\" When I in-quired about the nature of his visit he stated, \"I'm going to wish her a happy Thanksgiving.\" It was February. Getting insulted, berated, and threa tened frequently at work is taxing. Being able to use some of 62 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022EMalumni The goal was to create something that made people laugh while educating them about stigmatized topics in healthcare.\" Andr\u00e9s Mallipudi is seen on t he previous page and Darien Sutton-Ramsay is featured on this page. 63 DC-06/22/202264commentary as material at an upcoming show does not make it worthwhile, but it can soften the blow when the amusingly confused racist is telling me to go back to \"...whichever country it is that your parents come from.\" Performances include material tha t touches on a medical topic that fits the theme of the month, which has included STDs, mental health disorders, and drug addiction. Comedy is difficult, and making people laugh when discussing a suicide attempt or a decade long addiction to methamphetamines takes an incredible amount of talent. We are fortunate to live in a city with many of the best comedians in the world. The comics we've booked have been up to the task of sharing a unique perspective on illness while simultaneously crushing it onstage. Finding some semblance of joy in top ics that cause discomfort, both as patients and physicians, can hopefully lead to increased awareness and dialogue about these issues. Whether or not we are able to accomplish this through a comedy show remains to be seen, but we're finding the pursuit to be worthwhile. Darien and I met during my NYU- Bell evue sub-internship, and we continued to work together on many Team 2 shifts throughout my intern year. While Darien was contributing regularly to SiriusXM Doctor Radio and creating MedEd content across his social media platforms, I remained steadfast in my pursuit of bombing at open mics. Fitting comedy into an intern schedule was not easy, and sometimes involved going to spots post call. One particular Lower East Side venue, Caveat, was working to fuse comedy and education in their shows and they were supportive when I pitched the idea of Doctors Without Boundaries. They suggested getting a co-host and Darien immediately came to mind. Darien, with no background in comedy, was able to scrape by on his intelligence, beauty, and charisma. Also, he is frustratingly hilarious. COVID-19 has obviously dominated our lives. H ealthcare workers in New Y ork City were publicly praised and inundated with free beauty products. In short, we all finally knew what it felt like to be @doctor.darien a certified influencer. On the night of March 10th, 2020 an att ending came by after stabilizing their first COVID-19 patient. In lieu of their traditional electrocardiogram quizzing session, we reviewed the epidemiological data coming out of Italy. They were peaking. Based on their estimates, NYC was days to weeks from being in a similar position. After that shift, Darien and I tried to figure out how we could simultaneously promote social distancing and responsibly host a live medical comedy show in a crowded NYC basement mid-pandemic. We could not. Fortunately, our producer Kate Downey and the team at Caveat were able to quickly pivot, and we became one of the first shows in the city to transition to streaming online live from the venue without an audience. I developed COVID-19 symptoms on Frida y, March 13 at the end of a string of Team 1 overnight shifts. For NYU-Bellevue emergency medicine alumni, the scariest part of that sentence was likely \"Team 1 overnight.\" After sign out my back ached more than usual, and the scratch in the back of my throat had turned into a cough. That evening my low-grade temperature surpassed the 100.6 benchmark for work excusable illness, and for the first time I activated sick call (sorry Janelle (RES '21)). We pivoted again, and avoided even a small ga thering of performers by glitching our way through a Zoom show. At the beginning of our show, Darien said \"If COVID is a marathon, then Andr\u00e9s tripped over the starting line.\" At the time, I took solace in the thought that my antibodies were running laps around Darien's superior immune system. Eight months later EMalumni DC-06/22/2022my antibodies are gone and Darien still hasn't sneezed in over a year. This past year was difficult, and it loo ks like we will continue to face new and existing challenges. Despite these, we are grateful to be working as emergency physicians and for the opportunities we've been afforded through our friendship, show, and NYU-Bellevue training. This past year alone, Darien signed with ABC News as a medical correspondent, moved to LA, began modeling for FIGS\u00ae, received gifts from Beyonc\u00e9, and has gained tens of thousands of followers on social media. And I became a third year resident. Finding some semblance of joy in topics that cause discomfort, both as patients and physicians, can hopefully lead to increased awareness and dialogue about these issues.\" 65 EMalumni DC-06/22/2022OBITUARIES 66 66 EMalumniWEWE CELEBRATE CELEBRATE YOUR LIFE YOUR LIFE DC-06/22/2022EMalumni 67WEWE CELEBR CELEBRA ATE TE Y YO OUR LIFE UR LIFE DC-06/22/2022CLEOPAS MILTON WILLIAMS, JR, MD 1963 - 2020 68 EMalumniCLASS OF 1998 DC-06/22/2022Cleopas \"Cleo\" Milton Williams, Jr. MD, died on July 3, 2020 in Melbourne, Florida.

Being a physician underrepresentedin medicine, he sought to train at a public hospital andwas committed to caring for underserved populations. \"Cleo was simply one of the most wonderful human beings that I ever had the privilege of knowing,\" said Dr. Wally Carter, director of our residency program at that time. He spoke highly of Cleo's clinical skills and fondly remembers his zest for life as a young resident. Cleo was a devoted, highly involved, enthusiastic resident who always was available to lend a helping hand. His high energy was infectious and his devotion to his patients admirable. \"His smile was contagious and he was always available for a good laugh,\" said his co-resident Dr. Jeff Manko. Cleo was a \"gentle giant\" whose physical presence was big and welcoming. Dr. Susan Stone, his friend and co-resident is saddened as she \"prized his friendship.\" Cleo's life was one of service.

Is with sadness that we announce the passing of Dr. Brian T. Fletcher a friend and colleague to many of us. In 1996, Brian, a Phi Beta Kappa, graduated Magna Cum Laude from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois and subsequently moved to Chicago to pursue a career in medicine at the University of Chicago, Pritzker School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois. In 2004 Brian came to New York. His compassion, love for medicine, and a sense of social responsibility led him to train at NYU-Bellevue as an emergency physician. After graduating, Brian eventually made Los Angeles, CA his home, where he was known not only as a brilliant and caring emergency physician, but as an intellectual who was called on frequently by several organizations and media to share his vast knowledge and experiences as an emergency physician. Jeffrey Manko, his emergency medicine residency director and friend, remembers Brian as a free spirit who embraced life. He was a friend to everyone and was always willing to lend a shoulder or ear to comfort others. He had a way of making everyone feel special and exuded warmth and caring to his patients and colleagues. Brian provided thoughtful and compassionate care to his patients and was a strong advocate for underserved populations. Brian was \"a glowing presence and radiant spirit who was the brightest light in the room,\" and will be remembered fondly by his NYU-Bellevue emergency medicine family. Our deepest sympathies go out to Brian's parents, siblings, and loved ones.
