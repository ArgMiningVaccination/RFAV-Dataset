The recommendations for people vaccinated outside of the United States depend on the number and type of vaccine(s) received. People who initiated vaccination outside of the United States should complete the recommended actions described below (Table A). For additional guidance on COVID-19 vaccination, see [guidance for people who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#not-immunocompromised). The recommended actions in Table A are based on the schedule and guidance for people who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised. These actions should be modified accordingly for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised based on the schedule and [guidance for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised).

People ages 6 months and older should receive at least 1 age-appropriate bivalent mRNA vaccine dose at least 2 months after their last monovalent vaccine dose. People ages 65 years and older have the option to receive 1 additional bivalent mRNA vaccine dose at least 4 months after the first bivalent mRNA vaccine dose. A monovalent Novavax booster dose (instead of a bivalent mRNA dose) may be used after completion of primary vaccination [in limited situations](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#recommend-booster-vaccination) in people ages 18 years and older who have not received any previous booster dose(s). The Novavax booster dose is administered at least 6 months after the last primary series dose. \u00a7COVID-19 vaccines that are listed for [emergency use by WHO](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/vaccinescovid-19-vaccine-eul-issued), but are not approved or authorized by FDA, have not been evaluated for efficacy or safety by CDC or ACIP. \u00b6This scenario also includes people who received a heterologous primary series or booster dose composed of doses of COVID-19 vaccines listed for emergency use by WHO, at least one of which is not FDA-approved or FDA-authorized. Special situation: Do not administer a second bivalent mRNA vaccine dose if the person previously received a bivalent Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine dose containing the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and Omicron BA.1 variant unless the person is age 65 years or older: These people have the option to receive 1 additional bivalent mRNA vaccine dose at least 4 months after the first bivalent mRNA vaccine dose. U.S. trial participants, along with non-U.S.-based participants in the same trial, who received all the recommended primary series doses of a vaccine that is not listed for emergency use by WHO but for which a U.S. data and safety monitoring board or equivalent has independently confirmed efficacy are considered [up to date](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with their COVID-19 vaccines when they have received 1 bivalent mRNA vaccine dose. At this time, only the Medicago COVID-19 Vaccine in people ages 18 years and older and Sanofi-GSK COVID-19 Vaccine in people ages 18-59 years meet these criteria. For information on COVID-19 vaccination, see [guidance for people who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#not-immunocompromised) and [guidance for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised). A vaccine administration error is any preventable event that might cause or lead to inappropriate use of vaccine or patient harm. The [FDA-issued Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccines](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) should be referenced for detailed information on storage and handling, dosing and schedule, dose preparation, and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. The information provided below on managing vaccine administration errors should not be interpreted as a recommendation or promotion of unauthorized use of the vaccines. For all vaccine administration errors: - Inform the recipient of the vaccine administration error. - Consult with the [state immunization program](/vaccines/imz-managers/awardee-imz-websites.html)and/or [immunization information system (IIS)](/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html)to determine how the dose should be entered into the IIS, both as an administered dose and to account for inventory. - Report the error to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), unless otherwise indicated in the table. Providers are required to report all COVID-19 vaccine administration errors\u2014even those not associated with an adverse event\u2014to VAERS. To file an electronic report, see the [VAERS website](https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html). - Determine how the error occurred and implement strategies to prevent it from happening again. A discussion on strategies to prevent errors can be found in the [\"Vaccine Administration\" chapter](/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/vac-admin.html)of [Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases](/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/index.html)(Pink resources can be found on CDC's [vaccine administration](/vaccines/hcp/admin/admin-protocols.html)web page, including a job aid for preventing errors. - Follow the revaccination guidance in the table below, using an age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccine product. Then continue with the recommended schedule of subsequent dose(s) unless otherwise noted in Table C. The recommendations in the table below apply to all FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines and all doses unless otherwise stated. Table C. Interim recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine administration errors and deviations |Type||Administration error/deviation||Interim recommendation| |Site/route|| |Product || and || | | |Interchangeability|| || | | || | | | || | | || | |Diluent (Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine formulation [orange cap maroon cap])|| || | | || | | || | | | || | | || | |Diluent (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine formulation that should not be mixed with diluent, i.e., gray cap)|| || | *Do not administer the second dose until the person becomes eligible to receive vaccination (either by reaching the authorized age or if the authorization is extended to include additional age groups), even if this results in the second dose being administered after the recommended interval between doses. In addition to the minimum age, some experts suggest delaying the second dose for 8 weeks after the invalid dose based on the potential for increased reactogenicity and the rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis from mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. If the administration error resulted in a higher-than-authorized vaccine dose, in general a subsequent dose may still be administered at the recommended interval. However, if local or systemic side effects following vaccination are clinically concerning (outside of the expected side effect profile), lead to serious adverse reactions, or are ongoing at the time of the subsequent dose, this dose might be delayed, but this decision should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. FDA authorization allows for dosing options for certain situations where a child ages from a younger to older age group; see [Transitioning from a younger to older age group](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#transitioning-younger-older). If the dosing is in accordance with the FDA EUA, it is not considered an error and VAERS reporting is not indicated. \u00a7An 8-week interval between the first and second doses of mRNA and Novavax COVID-19 vaccines may be optimal for some people ages 6 months-64 years, especially for males ages 12-39 years, as it may reduce the small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with these vaccines. The authorized interval (4 weeks for Moderna and 3 weeks for Novavax and Pfizer-BioNTech) between the first and second doses remains the recommended interval for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised; adults ages 65 years and older; and in situations in which there is increased concern about an individual's higher risk of severe disease. \u00b6As of the date of this update, current manufacturer contact information is: - Pfizer: 1-877-VAX-CO19 for the most up-to-date manufacturer information. #Vaccine doses administered up to 4 days before the minimum interval may be counted and do not need to be repeated. |CONTRAINDICATION TO COVID-19 VACCINATION||PRECAUTION TO COVID-19 VACCINATION||NO CONTRAINDICATION OR PRECAUTION TO COVID-19 VACCINATION| |History of the following: ||Among people without a contraindication, history of: | Note: People with an allergy-related contraindication to one type of COVID-19 vaccine have a precaution to the other types of COVID-19 vaccines.4,5 |Among people without a contraindication or precaution, a history | |Actions: ||Actions: 1 COVID-19 sheets](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) and [U.S. COVID-19 Vaccine Product Information](/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/index.html) can be consulted for a full list of ingredients. People with a contraindication to one of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should not receive doses of either of the mRNA vaccines. However, some of these people may be able to receive Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine after a detailed risk assessment (see footnote 5 below). 2 An immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable therapy is defined as any hypersensitivity-related signs or symptoms such as urticaria (hives), angioedema (visible swelling), respiratory distress (e.g., wheezing, stridor), or anaphylaxis that occurs within four hours following administration. [Severe allergic reactions](/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/adverse-reactions.html) include: - Possible anaphylaxis, a progressive life-threatening reaction that typically includes urticaria but also with other symptoms such as wheezing, difficulty breathing, or low blood pressure - Any angioedema affecting the airway (i.e., tongue, uvula, or larynx) - Diffuse rash which also involves mucosal surfaces (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) Non-severe allergic reactions might include: - Urticaria (hives) beyond the injection site - Angioedema (visible swelling) involving lips, facial skin, or skin in other locations. NOTE: Any angioedema affecting the airway (i.e., tongue, uvula, or larynx) would NOT be in this category and is considered a severe allergic reaction [3 People with a history of anaphylaxis after a non-COVID-19 vaccine or injectable therapy that contains multiple components, one or more of which is a component of a COVID-19 vaccine, but it is unknown which component elicited the allergic reaction, have a precaution to vaccination with that COVID-19 vaccine. These people may benefit from consultation with an allergist-immunologist who can perform a more detailed risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccine receipt.] 4 For people with a history of an immediate, non-severe allergic reaction after [one type of COVID-19 vaccine](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#COVID-19-vaccines), vaccination with a subsequent dose of that same type of COVID-19 vaccine should only be undertaken in an appropriate setting under the supervision of a health care provider experienced in the management of severe allergic reactions. Administering a different type of COVID-19 vaccine is another option; this can be done in the usual vaccination setting. 5 Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an ingredient in both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, and polysorbate 80 is an ingredient in Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine. PEG and polysorbate are structurally related, and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these compounds might occur. - People with a known allergy to polysorbate have a contraindication to Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine and a precaution to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech). - In all other cases, an allergy-related contraindication to one type of COVID-19 vaccine is a precaution to the others. For people with these precautions, referral to an allergist-immunologist should be considered. Healthcare professionals and health departments may also request a consultation from the [Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment COVIDvax](/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/cisa/index.html) project. In patients with these precautions, vaccination should only be undertaken in an appropriate setting under the supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the management of severe allergic reactions. 6 Risk assessment: The following considerations can be used to help the vaccination provider conduct a risk assessment for vaccination in people with a precaution to vaccination because of allergy: - Risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus (e.g., because of occupational or institutional setting) - Risk of severe disease or death due to COVID-19 (e.g., because of age, underlying medical conditions) - Unknown risk of anaphylaxis following COVID-19 vaccination in a person with a history of anaphylaxis after other vaccines or injectable therapies (Appendix D, footnote 3); consultation with an allergist-immunologist may help to clarify the risk assessment for these people - Ability of the patient to be vaccinated in a setting where appropriate medical care is immediately available for anaphylaxis; for people with a contraindication due to allergy to one type of COVID-19 vaccine who are receiving another type that has been deemed a precaution and for people with an immediate, non-severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine who are receiving vaccination with a subsequent dose of that COVID-19 vaccine type, vaccination should only be undertaken in an appropriate setting under the supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the management of severe allergic reactions - For information on the management of anaphylaxis see [Preparing for the Potential Management of Anaphylaxis after COVID-19 Vaccination](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html)and [laboratory evaluation of people who experience anaphylaxis after vaccination](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/testing-after-allergic-reaction.html) [The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Interim Recommendation for Use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine \u2014 United States, December 2020](/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6950e2.htm) [The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Interim Recommendation for Use of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine \u2014 United States, December 2020](/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e1.htm) [The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Interim Recommendation for Use of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine \u2014 United States, February 2021](/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7009e4.htm) [Updated Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for Use of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine After Reports of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Among Vaccine Recipients\u2014United States, April 2021](/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7017e4.htm) [The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Interim Recommendation for Use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Adolescents Aged 12-15 years \u2014 United States, May 2021](/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7020e1.htm) [Use of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine After Reports of Myocarditis Among Vaccine Recipients: Update from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 United States, June 2021](/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7027e2.htm) [Use of COVID-19 Vaccines After Reports of Adverse Events Among Adult Recipients of Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) and mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna): Update from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 United States, July 2021](/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/pdfs/mm7032e4-H.pdf) [Use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Persons Aged 16 Years: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 United States, September 2021](/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e2.htm) [The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Interim Recommendations for Additional Primary and Booster Doses of COVID-19 Vaccines \u2014 United States, 2021](/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7044e2.htm) [The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Interim Recommendation for Use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Children Aged 5-11 Years \u2014 United States, November 2021](/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7045e1.htm) [Use of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine: Updated Interim Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 United States, December 2021](/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7103a4.htm) [The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Recommendation for Use of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in Adults Aged 18 Years and Considerations for Extended Intervals for Administration of Primary Series Doses of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines \u2014 United States, February 2022](/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7111a4.htm) [Interim Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for Use of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines in Children Aged 6 Months-5 Years \u2014 United States, June 2022](/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7126e2.htm) [Interim Recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for Use of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine in Persons Aged 18 years \u2014 United States, July 2022.](/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7131a2.htm) [Safety Monitoring of Bivalent COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Booster Doses Among Persons Aged 12 Years \u2014 United States, August 31-October 23, 2022](/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7144a3.htm).
