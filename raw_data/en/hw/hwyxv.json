Abstract [Food Allergy](https://www.iafaforallergy.com/allergies-a-to-z/food-allergy/) is an allergic reaction manifested by an abrupt onset of symptoms within minutes to hours after ingesting the food. Some foods are known to cause adverse reactions and toxic effects in some individuals. These abnormal reactions could either be due to food insensitivity, food allergies or food intolerance. In Ayurveda, various food allergic conditions are correlated with Aahar Asatmyata. The present case report deals with a 6-year boy patient of food allergy who came for Ayurvedic treatment at IAFA. Swaras Chikitsa (high potency herbal extract in liquid form administered orally) is used as the best choice of treatment along with other internal herbal medicine for food allergy. The results revealed the healing process of the food allergies and there was much symptomatic relief for the patient. Patient had continued these medicines for three months. His symptoms such as severe headache, fever, nausea and vomiting subsided after taking treatment from IAFA. The understanding of this Ayurvedic ancient wisdom may prove to be of immense importance in the treatment. Keywords: Food Allergy, Aahar Asatmyata, Swaras Chikitsa Introduction In modern medicine, the only proven therapy for food induced allergic reactions is the strict elimination of the particular or suspected allergen but it is very difficult to follow strict elimination of that particular food. Unfortunately, there are no efficacious drugs available in modern medicine for the management of food allergies and the patients have to be dependent on corticosteroids and antihistamines for the treatment. The present case report deals with a patient of food induced allergic reaction who came for Ayurvedic treatment for Food allergies at IAFA. His parents got the reference of IAFA from one of his close relatives. Dr. Sahil Gupta is the CEO and founder of IAFA.
