For more than a half-century, a cramped \"iron triangle\" ethos has constrained health reform conceptually. Reforms aimed to balance individual interests in cost, quality, and access to health care, while marginalizing equity, solidarity, and public health.

Health reform reconstruction begins with a new conceptual framework that aims to realize health justice.

The \"iron triangle\" \u2014 health care access, cost, and quality \u2014 that has informed a half-century of reforms lacks the ambition and scope to guide our next steps. We must reconstruct health reform, and ultimately the health system, using new principles and a new method. Incremental reforms may be unavoidable but they must be designed to be intentionally confrontational , with an eye toward their place in the broader project of upending or transcending the legal structures that undermine public health and propagate subordination and inequity. The thesis of this Article is that decades of reforms failed to prepare the United States for 2020 because health reform has been conceptually and structurally constrained and to transcend these constraints requires nothing short of reconstruction. 7 7 Casting the project of overcoming and replacing the conceptions and structures that have defined and constrained health reform as a reconstruction recognizes three dimensions of the term: first, its definition, \"to construct again\" especially after severe damage, captures our argument that the U.S. system is even more damaged after the pandemic and requires rebuilding with a new ethos for a new age. See Reconstruct , MERRIAM -WEBSTER , https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reconstruct (last visited Aug. 21, 2021) [https://perma.cc/BU2Q-AX5L]. Second, its medical meaning contemplates surgical restoration of function in a body part, also after damage or to correct structural defects. See, e.g. , Reconstructive Surgery , WEBMD, https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/reconstructive-surgery (last visited Aug. 24, 2021) [https://perma.cc/C67M-P9KG] (describing reconstructive surgery in the clinical sense). Third, the anti-subordination valence of our argument makes normative claims about the transformative reforms necessary to address the effects of systemic racism. It thus draws normative perspective from the post-Civil War Reconstruction period and Civil Rights movement (often referred to as the Second Reconstruction), as well as the laws and critical theory that have grown out of them. Cf., e.g. , Rhonda V. Magee Andrews, The Third Reconstruction: An Alternative to Race Consciousness and Colorblindness in Post-Slavery America , 54 A LA. L.

Newkirk II, America's Health Segregation Problem , A TLANTIC (May 18, 662 University of California, Davis [Vol. 55:657 We develop the project of health reform reconstruction by drawing four vital lessons from the pandemic \u2014 a pair of normative lessons bookending a pair of constructive lessons. First, health justice must replace the long-dominant but conceptually blinkered iron triangle. Second, legally and logistically entrenched fixtures of individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization constrain health reform even when it reaches toward health justice, as it has done at times during the pandemic. Third, each of these fixtures reinforces and stems from racism and other forms of social subordination. Fourth, to make meaningful progress toward health justice, even incremental reforms must confront or transcend the fixtures that have constrained reform for decades. The first lesson we draw from the pandemic is that health reform requires new principles rooted in solidarity, equity, and justice. In Part I, we argue that 2020 should mark the end of what we call \"the iron triangle era\" of health reform, dating back to the 1960s, in which reforms sought to balance three points: access to, quality of, and costs of medical care. Over time, the iron triangle's mode of pragmatic tradeoffs created a piecemeal approach to health care regulation that culminated in the Affordable Care Act. 2016), https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/americas-health-segregation- problem/483219/ [https://perma.cc/PJA4-KM5G] (tracing the history of de facto and de jure racial segregation in health care from the Jim Crow era to today). We recognize that reconstruction efforts come with trenchant backlash. See generally Keith Aoki , The Scholarship of Reconstruction and the Politics of Backlash , 81 I OWA L. REV. 1467, 1468 (1996) (describing backlash as \"vituperative and largely unconscious reaction to the social progress\" of marginalized communities); Ford, supra , at 2949 (\"The Supreme Court has used individual rights to undermine much of the practical work of the Second Reconstruction . . . .\"); Harris, supra , at 758 (noting the \"political backlash against feminism and civil rights\"). In health reform, even the modest, market-based ACA has already sparked backlash. See, e.g. , Jonathan Cohn, The ACA, Repeal, and the Politics of Backlash , H EALTH AFFS. BLOG (Mar. 6, 2020), https://www.healthaffairs.org/ do/10.1377/hblog20200305.771008/full/ [https://perma.cc/A22T-TWRD] (tracing the political backlash during the first decade after the ACA's enactment). So acknowledging that the backlash to health reform is inevitable, we argue that such reform should at least aim for a reconstruction. For an early use of \"reconstruction\" with respect to health reform, see Ed Sparer, Fundamental Human Rights, Legal Entitlements, and the Social Struggle: A Friendly Critique of the Critical Legal Studies Movement , 36 S TAN. L. REV. 509, 551 (1984) (\"[T]he very struggle to reconstruct health care, organized along mutual aid lines which stress cooperative and caring relations, helps to provide a grace . . . and character to society and to each person who struggles for it.\"). Harris & Pamukcu, supra note 4. On the legacies of slavery, segregation, and civil rights in health care, consider D AYNA BOWEN MATTHEW , JUST MEDICINE : A CURE FOR RACIAL INEQUALITY IN AMERICAN HEALTH CARE 9-32 (NYU Press 1st ed. 2015). 2021] Health Reform Reconstruction 663 To guide post-2020 health reform, we propose a new set of principles oriented toward realizing health justice and social solidarity in health care. 8 Justice and social solidarity have long been core values of public health law, policy, practice, and ethics9 \u2014 albeit \"still largely aspirational\" ones.10 We aim to integrate them as core values of health care law and policy. Health justice demands that reformers address the role of health care laws and policies in reinforcing \u2014 or, alternatively, dismantling \u2014 racism, economic injustice, and other forms of social subordination. Reformers must ensure equitable distribution of the benefits and burdens of robust public investments in health care and public health, measured in terms of population-level health outcomes and community wellbeing, in addition to the intermediate indicators of health care access, quality, and cost. Decision-making processes related to health must ensure recognition, representation, and empowerment of subordinated individuals and communities. In short, health care regulation should embrace public health principles and strive for anti- subordination, equity, and community empowerment, expanding far beyond the cramped iron triangle. The second, related lesson we draw from the pandemic is that health reform has been structurally constrained by fixtures that impede solidarity and egalitarian justice. In Part II, we describe how the U.S. response to the COVID pandemic was stymied by four fixtures: individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization. These fixtures, which we identified in a prior collaboration, 11 hold back mutual aid in the U.S. health care system, causing the system to function particularly poorly under the stress of a national public health crisis. Our individualistic, multi-payer, state-by-state, privately-administered health care system, in which health care entities are insulated from 8 See WILLIAM M. SAGE, SOLIDARITY : UNFASHIONABLE , BUT STILL AMERICAN 10 (2009); Fuse Brown et al., supra note 1, at 411-12; Wendy K.

POL'Y & L. 287, 290 (1993); Lindsay F. Wiley, From Patient Rights to Health Justice: Securing the Public's Interest in Affordable, High-Quality Health Care , 37 C ARDOZO L. REV. 833, 859 (2016) [hereinafter Health Justice ]. 9 See, e.g. , Lawrence O. Gostin & Madison Powers, What Does Social Justice Require for the Public's Health? Public Health Ethics and Policy Imperatives , 25 HEALTH AFFS. 1053, 1053 (2006) (\"Justice is viewed as so central to the mission of public health that it has been described as the field's core value . . . .\"). 10 Lindsay F. Wiley & Samuel R. Bagenstos, The Personal Responsibility Pandemic: Centering Social Solidarity in Public Health and Employment Law , 52 A RIZ. STATE L.J. 1235, 1237 (2020). 11 Fuse Brown et al., supra note 1, at 414-17. 664 University of California, Davis [Vol. 55:657 public health responsibilities, failed to support the medical countermeasures that are critical in a communicable disease crisis \u2014 including testing, therapeutics, and vaccination. 12 Our inability to distribute scarce resources in ways that maximize collective benefits has undermined the effectiveness of the pandemic response, representing a functional failure of the health care system. An embedded lesson here is that individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization are more than mere features of American health law. They are gravitational. We describe these structures conceptually as fixtures because they are legally and logistically entrenched. They are rooted in a constellation of constitutional provisions, laws, institutions, economic arrangements, and cultural and ideological commitments, rather than a single law. 13 Agencies, companies, workforces, relationships, and economies are built around the fixtures. The third lesson we draw from the pandemic is that the fixtures of individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization have contributed to a failure of American health care so profound we describe it as existential: stark racial inequity in the burden of disease. In Part III, we describe how each of the fixtures is historically rooted in and perpetuates racism, thereby subverting health equity and community empowerment. Because the fixtures have played historic and inherent roles in creating and reinforcing subordination, reforms accommodating them will continue to perpetuate racial injustice. The 12 Medical countermeasures have a dual purpose. They are used for clinical purposes (diagnosis and treatment of individuals), distinguishing them from \"non-pharmaceutical interventions\" such as mask mandates, school closures, and business restrictions. But medical countermeasures also serve public health purposes. For example, testing is both a tool for individual diagnosis as well as a tool of public health surveillance and disease control. Vaccination has benefits for the vaccinated individual as well as for others who may be protected by reduced transmission. A robust and comprehensive pandemic response requires both clinical interventions for the benefit of individuals and public health interventions for the common good. L AWRENCE O. GOSTIN & LINDSAY F. WILEY, PUBLIC HEALTH LAW: POWER , DUTY, RESTRAINT 346, 392 (3d. ed. 2016) (describing the role of medical countermeasures in public health surveillance and disease control, and contrasting medical countermeasures for pandemic response with non-pharmaceutical interventions). As this Article focuses on the failures of the U.S. health care system, our analysis focuses on the medical interventions that system is expected to deliver, rather than on non-pharmaceutical interventions. 13 The concept of a fixture is thus related to the concept of \"super-statutes\" in its description of entrenchment, but distinct in the origins and effects of that entrenchment. See generally William N. Eskridge, Jr. & John Ferejohn, Super-Statutes , 50 D UKE L.J. 1215, 1215, 1230-37 (2001) (describing \"super-statutes\" as singular statutory enactments that \"successfully penetrate public normative and institutional culture in a deep way\"). 2021] Health Reform Reconstruction 665 accommodative stance of iron-triangle reforms has become untenable for reformers who are committed to anti-racism. The existential failures during the pandemic thus demand a more confrontational approach to the fixtures in future reforms. The fourth lesson we draw from the pandemic is that implementing reform requires a new method. In Part IV, we offer an approach for operationalizing our bolder health justice reform principles within a system still constrained by the fixtures. We call this method confrontational incrementalism . Its end goal is to reconstruct health reform by dismantling the legal structures that hold it back. Its approach acknowledges the difficulty of that task, owing to the fixtures' entrenchment. Reforms can reconcile ambition with pragmatism by identifying whether an incremental policy change serves as a stepping stone or stumbling block for confronting the fixtures that stymie health justice. Although incremental, this approach to the fixtures promotes vigilance about the accumulated effects of reforms that accommodate, rather than confront them. It provides an assessment of each incremental reform's confrontation with the fixtures based on its contribution to anti-racism, equitable distribution, and community empowerment. Ultimately, confrontational incrementalism demands more attention to the tradeoffs and accumulated accommodations that come with incrementalism, as well as to the ways that incremental accommodations to the fixtures perpetuate subordination. Confrontational incrementalism thus offers a navigational tool for getting us closer to realizing the ambitious goals of health justice. By elucidating the concept of fixtures and providing a method for health reforms to confront them, we hope to provide reformers who focus on other areas \u2014 the criminal justice system, drug policy, environmental regulation, the education system, housing, and employment, to name a few \u2014 with a navigational tool for crafting and assessing anti-racist reform efforts rooted in solidarity and community empowerment. The project of health reform reconstruction may seem overwhelming, especially because it starts with a recognition of the potency and stickiness of obstacles to health justice in the United States. We draw hope, however, in the fact that scholars and advocates are already laying the groundwork for reconstruction as we understand it. Angela Harris's & Aysha Pamukcu's recent call for the development of a civil rights of health, rooted in health justice, is a bold example of confrontational incrementalism targeted directly at individualism and its perverse 666 University of California, Davis [Vol. 55:657 implications for both health and subordination.14 In prior work, each of us has proposed pragmatic reforms that, upon reflection, also show particular promise in the ways they confront the structural fixtures of individualism, fragmentation, privatization, or federalism. 15 Some policymakers have shown nascent interest in such proposals.16 Linking together these efforts as part of the larger project of health reform reconstruction provides new direction, motivation, and a framework for not only recognizing structural bias in our law but doing something about it. I. L ESSON 1: HEALTH REFORM RECONSTRUCTION REQUIRES A NEW ETHOS Generations of health reform advocates and health care scholars across disciplines have warned that the U.S. health care system has serious deficiencies.17 Many have acknowledged that it is, more 14 Harris & Pamukcu, supra note 4, at 765. 15 See Erin C.

Thus, the first lesson we draw from the pandemic is that the gestalt of health reform itself demands reconstruction, jettisoning the old \"iron triangle\" ethos and embracing a new era of health justice. A. The Iron Triangle Era The U.S. health care system that met the pandemic is a patchwork product of more than half a century of reforms driven by incrementalism, individualism, and commitment to private ordering. The prevailing ethos of this half-century of health reforms has sought to balance (1) access to, (2) the quality of, and (3) the costs of medical care, famously dubbed the \"iron triangle\" by William Kissick in 1994. 20 The iron triangle accepts as a fundamental starting point that these three priorities are the most important and that there are unavoidable trade-offs between them. 21 Kissick's iron triangle described the thrust behind 18 See, e.g. , Lawrence D. Brown, The Amazing Noncollapsing U.S. Health Care System \u2014 Is Reform Finally at Hand? , 358 N EW ENG. J. MEDICINE 325, 325 (2008) (\"a nonsystem, an incoherent pastiche that has long repulsed reforms sought by private and public stakeholders\"); Isaac D. Buck, Affording Obamacare , 71 H ASTINGS L.J. 261, 305 (2020) (\"a bloated and under-regulated non-system\"); Walter B. Maher, Health Care in America: Implications for Business and the Economy , 3 S TAN.

See, e.g. , WENDY E. PARMET , POPULATIONS , PUBLIC HEALTH , AND THE LAW 193 (2009) (\"By ignoring the interdependency of health and the importance of populations, American health law has helped establish a health care system that is unprepared both for public health emergencies and the more common, everyday threats that populations face.\"); William M.

Over the course of his career in health policy, Dr. Kissick shaped multiple reforms characteristic of the era we borrow his phrase to label. As a White House staffer, he participated in a task force launched in 1964 that led to the proposal for Medicare, among other reforms. The book in which he coined his most famous phrase focused on Clinton-era health reform proposals, which culminated (somewhat disappointingly) in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\"). 21 Id. at 2 (\"[I]n what I call the iron triangle of health care . . . access, quality, and cost containment have equal angles, representing identical priorities, and an expansion of any one angle compromises one or both of the other two. All societies confront the 668 University of California, Davis [Vol. 55:657 reforms of the prior three decades and became the prevailing frame for assessing every health reform effort in the ensuing twenty-five years, setting up the dominant narrative that U.S. efforts to expand access and quality come with inevitable and substantial cost increases. 22 Kissick treated public health as ancillary to the health care system and equity concerns as answered through universal access to medical care, which he assumed would be too expensive to be feasible. 23 The iron triangle ethos guided the advent of Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s, managed care cost-containment practices in the 1970s and 80s, the failed Clinton-era health security proposal in the 1990s, and the ACA's vision of fragmentary-but-universal coverage in the 2010s. 24 Some health-system reformers have pursued a sublimated version of the iron triangle, called the \"triple aim,\" which retooled the triangle into three new points: (1) improving the patient experience of care (a patient-service approach to quality), (2) improving the health of populations (blending access, quality, and \"population health,\" though not necessarily public health), and (3) reducing per capita costs of care. 25 Pointing to the \"unacceptable social cost\" of health care that is equal tensions among access to health services, quality of health care, and cost containment.

Nolan & John Whittington, The Triple Aim: Care, Health, And Cost , 27 H EALTH AFFS. 759, 760 (2008). While the triple aim is sometimes described as a framework for \"[i]mproving the U.S. health care system,\" id. at 759, comprehensively reforming the U.S. system also involves \"the realms of ethics and policy,\" which Berwick, Nolan, and Whittington characterize as external to the triple aim, id. at 760. The triple aim is perhaps more comprehensible as a tool for improving the functioning of any one of the many discrete \"health systems\" that make up the U.S. health care system \u2014 integrated networks of hospitals and physician practice groups, serving patient populations defined by geographic areas, and relying on capitated payment from third-party payers.

The coverage gains are not, in some important respects, \"universal.\" Worse, they have the potential to further entrench the fixtures that make truly transformative reforms so difficult in the first place. Even the public option \u2014 arguably the most radical proposal to gain much traction during the iron triangle era \u2014 sought to \"accommodate[e] the path-dependent history of American health insurance\" by limiting access to individuals who did not have the option of purchasing affordable employer-based coverage. 40 And the public option was ultimately left out of the ACA in spite of its proponents' accommodating stance. 41 In the ACA's first decade, Republican-led legal challenges and political sabotage have significantly undermined its ability to achieve its central aim of universal (but fragmented) coverage. 42 While the ACA 37 See OFF.

Pandemic Failures, Functional & Existential The COVID pandemic has subjected the iron triangle health care system to a stress test, revealing the magnitude of weaknesses and inequities that were baked in from the start. The pandemic revealed how functionally ineffective a diffuse, multi-payer, largely privatized health care system is at protecting individual and public health. And it reveals how, existentially, such a system is built on and perpetuates subordination. Of the numerous functional weaknesses exacerbating the public health and economic harms of the pandemic, the lack of universal coverage, the linkage between employment and coverage, and the fragmentary and inefficient financing of basic services like disease testing and vaccination have been especially glaring. A narrow focus on meeting the needs of individuals has stymied our public health response to the pandemic. Moreover, the diffusion of authority between levels of government, fragmented fiscal supports, and the many diverse providers in our largely privatized health care system have led to a U.S. failure to fairly allocate, adequately supply, or constrain prices for essential testing, therapeutics, and vaccines. Widespread public health measures may be delivered more effectively in countries with a centralized and unified public health care delivery system. 45 Future reform must reflect what we are learning from these functional failures.

U.S. health care's racial injustice is a failure on an existential scale, with effects that ripple throughout all aspects of American life. Future reforms must confront this existential failure with a bolder ethos that expands far beyond the iron triangle of quality, cost, and access - to eradicate subordination and its health effects. C. Health Reform Reconstruction: The Health Justice Era The COVID pandemic hit at a moment when the U.S. was in the early stages of what may prove to be a major shift in ethos \u2014 from distributing costs associated with sickness based on the principle of actuarial fairness toward a social solidarity principle premised on the \"goals of mutual aid and support.\" 56 The pandemic also coincided with growing support for the Black Lives Matter movement in response to systemic police violence against Black people.57 The public health and economic devastation wreaked by the virus and the growing awareness among white people of the role of structural racism in American law and society have highlighted our fundamental interdependence, while also putting our emerging commitments to mutual aid and solidarity to the test. The pandemic is teaching us that twenty-first century health reform demands attention to more than the iron triangle of quality, cost, and access.

We identify three core criteria for evaluating health reforms in the post-2020 era: anti-subordination, equitable distribution, and community empowerment. We draw these criteria from works by public health ethicists and critical race feminists, and from the health justice model developed in our prior work and in conversation with others. 58 First, anti-subordination : reforms must address the role of health laws and policies in reinforcing \u2014 or, alternatively, dismantling \u2014 structural racism, economic injustice, and other forms of social subordination.59 As Angela Harris and Aysha Pamukcu have argued, \"[r]ecognizing subordination as a driver of health is essential to solving the puzzle of persistent health disparities linked to group status.\" 60 Second, equitable distribution : health laws and policies must ensure just distribution of the burdens and benefits of public investments in health care and public health. 61 Access to health care, its quality, and its 58 See Benfer et al., supra note 4, at 141-51; Matthew B.

Health care is not the only resource that determines health outcomes.62 Individual access to health care may or may not correlate with improvements in financial security, community wellbeing, and population-level health outcomes.63 Distributive justice must also be responsive to the ways in which individuals are interconnected within groups \u2014 from families and households, to racial and ethnic groups, to schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods. Third, community empowerment : Decision-making processes related to health must ensure recognition, representation, and empowerment as means for collective self-determination, particularly for subordinated groups. 64 Realizing health justice requires a \"probing inquiry into the effects of social and cultural bias on the design and implementation of measures to reduce health disparities.\" 65 Emily Benfer and other health justice scholars have argued, \"[t]hese efforts cannot be led by the least advantaged, and to ensure that the burdens and benefits of interventions are distributed equitably.\"); Lindsay F.

In the post-pandemic era, \"the goals of public health (what we as a society do collectively to ensure the conditions for people to be healthy) and health care reform (efforts to improve systems for health care financing and delivery) should be more fully integrated within a communitarian ethic.\" 67 \"Rather than merely adopting social justice as the 'core value' of public health as . . . others have done,\" we argue that social justice should be embraced as \"a core value of health law and policy writ large .\"68 Using new criteria rooted in health justice, we can evaluate both the functional failures of the pandemic response and the broader existential failure to secure racial justice in health. II. L ESSON 2: FOUR FIXTURES CONTRIBUTE TO FUNCTIONAL FAILURES The second lesson we draw: the failed U.S. response to the COVID pandemic highlights the role of four fixtures \u2014 individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization \u2014 as structural constraints on health reform. 69 Precisely because the criteria we propose are rooted in anti-subordination, equity, and community empowerment, they inevitably collide with the fixtures, which are legally and logistically entrenched and have crippled the health care system's ability to meet public health needs. A. Fixtures A reconstruction project initially must survey the structures to be confronted and reconstructed. For health reform reconstruction, we begin with the concept of fixtures : forces whose \"structural and political entrenchment, as well as longstanding normative commitments, make 66 Benfer et al., supra note 4, at 139. 67 Wiley, Privatized Public Health Insurance , supra note 61, at 2160 n.40. 68 Wiley, Social Justice , supra note 6, at 52 (emphasis added); see also Wiley, Health Justice , supra note 8, at 881. 69 Fuse Brown et al., supra note 1, at 411. 2021] Health Reform Reconstruction 681 them difficult to displace.\"70 Recent scholarship has highlighted problems wrought by the forces of individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization in American health care. 71 This literature has largely treated these concepts singly and as if they were ordinary policy choices that might simply be accepted or rejected by policymakers. 72 We have posed, however, that individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization are more aptly described as \"fixtures of American law\" that reform cannot simply \"turn off\" without paying a steep price. 73 Their entrenchment means that fixtures operate not as mere policy options, but instead as forces that must be accommodated or confronted. Our concept of fixtures begins with their legal entrenchment. Similar to \"super-statutes,\" the fixtures \"exhibit . . . normative gravity\" and reshape the surrounding landscape.\" 74 Unlike super-statutes, fixtures are not embodied in one statute \u2014 or even one field of law. Instead, the fixtures we describe are embodied in a constellation of legal and regulatory provisions. This makes the fixtures more diffuse in their entrenchment than super-statutes, and thus harder to overcome. 75 Consider the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\"), a plausible super-statute.76 70 Id. at 414. 71 See, e.g. , Fuse Brown & McCuskey, supra note 15, at 443 (describing federalism); Allison K.

But see Hoffman, supra note 71, at 508-09 (describing individual choice in health insurance as embodying and propagating an underlying normative commitment). 73 Fuse Brown et al., supra note 1, at 414. 74 Eskridge, Jr. & Ferejohn, supra note 13, at 1215-16 (describing \"super-statutes\" as singular statutory enactments that \"successfully penetrate public normative and institutional culture in a deep way\"). 75 See id. 76 The ACA's status as super-statute is debatable and debated. E.g., Eric C. Fuse Brown, Developing a Durable Right to Health Care , 14 M INN. J.L. SCI. & TECH. 439, 443- 44 (2013) (arguing that while \"[t]he ACA has the pedigree of a superstatute\" in its ambition and breadth, the fragility of its right to health care places it in the category of \"quasi-superstatutes\" whose entrenchment remains in doubt); Abbe R. Gluck & Thomas Scott-Railton, Affordable Care Act Entrenchment , 108 G EO. L.J. 495, 516-17 (2020) (arguing that the \"ACA's staying power has . . . come from more diffuse and 682 University of California, Davis [Vol. 55:657 The ACA was a single enactment that touched hundreds of existing laws, spawned innumerable regulations, and significantly altered the landscape of health insurance regulation. 77 Its legal entrenchment in a single statute means that it can, in theory, be repealed in a single piece of legislation or struck down by Supreme Court in a single decision.78 By contrast, the fixture of federalism, for example, is legally entrenched through the Constitution, countless federal and state statutes, and two centuries of jurisprudence on comity and deference to state authority. 79 Beyond their legal manifestations, fixtures exhibit a form of entrenchment not previously explored in legal scholarship: logistical entrenchment . Institutions are built around the fixtures, as are workforces and bodies of expertise. These logistical considerations make it difficult to implement any reform that confronts the fixtures. For example, the administrative apparatus for our health care system is heavily dependent on private insurers and private health care providers, which means it would be practically difficult for a single-payer reform to switch entirely to government administration and rate setting. 80 Reliance on existing private structures would almost be compelled as a logistical matter, owing to the privatization fixture's logistical entrenchment. Moreover, the fixtures reinforce and further entrench each other, as seen in the deeply individualistic orientation of medical ethics, which entwines with private-law regulation of relationships multi-modal factors that are mostly unaccounted for by super-statute theorists,\" particularly its \"specific statutory design choices \u2014 the structural features of a law that entrench it \u2014 [and] the federalist architecture\"). 77 See generally Gluck et al., supra note 42, at 1473 (\"The ACA is the most significant healthcare legislation in recent American history . . . .\"); Gluck & Scott-Railton, supra note 76, at 498 (\"[T]he ACA has not only endured, but it has changed the way many Americans and the political arena think about healthcare and the entitlement to it.\"); Miriam Reisman, The Affordable Care Act, Five Years Later: Policies, Progress, and Politics , 40 P HARMACY 575, 575 (2015) (\"The ACA . . . is one of the most complex and comprehensive reforms of the American health system ever enacted.\"). 78 See, e.g. , Timothy Jost, Examining the House Republican ACA Repeal and Replace Legislation , H EALTH AFFS.

Recognizing individualism, fragmentation, federalism, and privatization as fixtures forces attention not only to the ubiquity of their impacts but also to strategies for overcoming them. They may not be as concrete as individual laws (whether super-statutes or regular ones), but neither are they as amorphous as purely abstract cultural norms or ideologies. Their legal and logistical entrenchment makes them more stubborn in some ways, but, as Part IV elaborates, more vulnerable in others. These four fixtures shape law and policy in fields beyond health care. And our conception of a fixture applies to forces beyond the four we highlight here. For example, the sovereignty of professional control over medicine could be a fixture, though professional autonomy arguably manifests individualism and privatization. 82 By elucidating the concept of fixtures here and applying it to health reform, we hope to provide reformers across disciplines with a navigational tool for crafting and assessing comprehensive reform efforts in other fields in which reconstruction is needed. 83 B. Fixtures' Functional Failures Our individualistic, fragmented, diffuse, private-industry health care system has failed us in the COVID pandemic. We focus this critique on the medical countermeasures that the health care system is responsible for delivering: testing, treatment, and vaccination, each of which has public health benefits in addition to the benefits they confer on individual patients. Our inability to distribute scarce supplies in a way 81 See, e.g. , William M. Sage, Adding Principle to Pragmatism: The Transformative Potential of \"Medicare-for-All\" 1, 33 (Feb. 2020) (unpublished draft), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3387120 [https://perma.cc/UL6P-SJSK] [hereinafter Adding Principle to Pragmatism] (arguing that individualistic professional ethics for physicians and pro-physician sentiment undermine the political viability of single-payer health reform proposals). 82 For a historical account of the rise of professional medical control and corporate dominance of the health system, see P AUL STARR, THE SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION OF AMERICAN MEDICINE : THE RISE OF A SOVEREIGN PROFESSION AND THE MAKING OF A VAST INDUSTRY 28 (1982). 83 See infra Part IV. 684 University of California, Davis [Vol. 55:657 that maximizes collective benefits has undermined the effectiveness of the pandemic response. 1. Individualism Individualism is a defining fixture of American cultural norms, policy, and law.84 Without a sufficient communitarian counterweight85 it manifests in three distinct, but interconnected ways that impede the realization of health justice. First, the individual \u2014 rather than the family, household, or community \u2014 is prioritized as the most important unit of inquiry, intervention, welfare maximization, and responsibility. 86 Second, regulating discrete interpersonal relations among atomistic individuals \u2014 rather than identifying and implementing structural solutions to structural problems \u2014 is prioritized as the aim of laws and policies. 87 Third, individual autonomy is prioritized over social values.88 Individualism is legally entrenched in our Constitution's emphasis on securing rights to be left alone and in health law's historical grounding in private law (generally) and freedom of contract (in particular). 89 It is 84 See, e.g. , Salter Storrs Clark, Individualism and Legal Procedure , 14 Y ALE L.J. 263, 263 (1905) (\"American individualism . . . is the most important factor in American liberty, and . . . also, perhaps, a large factor in our material prosperity. . . .

The former is communitarian centered in its focus.\"); Wiley, Health 2021] Health Reform Reconstruction 685 logistically entrenched in the individualistic professional ethics of medicine and our political and legal system's emphasis on personal responsibility for misfortune. 90 Iron-triangle reforms have been remarkably accommodating of individualism. So much so that \"choice\" is often treated as a fourth pillar of health law.91 Moreover, the iron triangle's emphasis on meeting individual needs for health care embraces a fundamentally individualistic orientation toward solving social problems. Many commentators have pointed to the focus of American cultural norms on the interests and rights of individuals as the key to explaining our failed pandemic response. 92 Some have specifically noted the individualistic focus of American law on personal responsibility as an impediment. 93 These criticisms have focused on individual resistance to, and inability to comply with, community mitigation measures (also known as non-pharmaceutical interventions): isolation of the infected, quarantine of the exposed, and social distancing and face-covering among the general population. 94 But individualism also pervades our Justice , supra note 8, at 835-36 (discussing how the individualistic bias of health care models is marked by private law regimes and relational professional ethics). 90 See Wiley & Bagenstos, supra note 10, at 1241-42; Sage, Adding Principle to Pragmatism, supra note 81, at 33-34. 91 See, e.g. , BARRY R.

See Wiley, Social Distancing , supra note 3, at 85- 94. Outside of the courts, opposition to and defiance of public health emergency orders and guidelines have undermined the effectiveness of community mitigation measures in the United States and in several other countries. The relationship between cultural norms and compliance with social distancing is as yet unclear.

Diagnostic tests, therapeutic treatments, and vaccinations are the foundations of a modern public health response. Our strong orientation toward viewing these tools through a clinical lens that centers individual patients and the providers who care for them has undermined our ability to deploy them as public health interventions. Disease testing is \"the foundation of modern pandemic prevention and response,\" particularly for a virus that can be transmitted by asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals. 95 When public health infrastructure is adequate, a positive test result should prompt health officials to provide social supports for isolation of the infected individual, investigation to trace their contacts, and quarantine of those contacts to disrupt onward transmission. Testing is also essential for disease surveillance purposes. To be effective and sustainable, public health orders closing schools and businesses should be tailored to local conditions. Without a carefully designed disease surveillance program based on random sampling and carefully defined parameters, the sheer number of reported cases is an unreliable indicator for comparing the scale of outbreaks from place to place and time to time. Recognizing the importance of testing as a public health tool, several countries quickly ramped up public health infrastructure for screening, isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and disease surveillance. 96 Huynh, Does Culture Matter Social Distancing Under the COVID-19 Pandemic? , 130 SAFETY SCI. 1 (2020) (analyzing different countries' responses to curbing the pandemic); Neha Deopa & Piergiuseppe Fortunato, Coronagraben.

In halting an early disease surveillance program in the Seattle area, the FDA disregarded the importance of monitoring trends at the population level \u2014 a purpose for which lower accuracy would be acceptable if carefully communicated to test subjects. 100 Lack of access to testing and the failure of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") to implement a rational disease surveillance system has left people unsure about whether they pose a risk of transmitting the virus to others and state and local leaders ill-equipped to deploy targeted disease control strategies. The same focus on individualism undermined early vaccination efforts. A rationally designed, carefully implemented public health vaccination campaign can support sustainable suppression of disease transmission. Even without enough vaccine supply to achieve suppression, a vaccination campaign can dramatically reduce hospitalizations and deaths by prioritizing groups for vaccination based on factors such as residential and workplace exposure, age, and underlying medical vulnerabilities. 101 Careful prioritization maximizes Petherick, Toby Phillips & Samuel Webster, Variation in Government Responses to COVID-19 , at 9, 17-18 (Univ.

It guides evaluation of our health care system based on individual access to high-quality health care and the costs associated with it, not on public health outcomes or equity. Deeper commitment to solidarity prompts us to assess the system in terms of its ability to serve \"uniquely public \u2014 as opposed to the mere aggregation of private \u2014 interests.\" 114 The COVID pandemic has amply demonstrated our health care system's catastrophic failures by these criteria. 2. Fiscal Fragmentation Fiscal fragmentation is the \"tendency to divide costs associated with Americans' sickness and health into separate, fiscally disintegrated categories.\" 115 Public health programs aimed at community prevention are financed separately from health care at a rate of pennies on the dollar. 116 The costs of health care for individuals who become sick are divided between the health care provider, the patient, the taxpayer, and the patient's insurer, if she has one.117 Costs borne by insurers are pooled across all enrollees, but fragmented among somewhat arbitrary actuarial groups based on payer, region, employer, age, and other categories.

The result is a bewildering assortment of fiscal categories, overseen by different entities, each incentivized to reduce its own costs, but not others'. Fragmentation impedes health justice in three ways. First, the legal division of responsibility for costs and benefits gives individuals, agencies, and programs an economic incentive to think only of themselves or the costs within their charge. In economic terms, this means that negative externalities (including harms to the public's health) will be over-produced, positive externalities (including public health benefits) will be under-produced, and equitable distribution will be marginalized. 119 Second, the logistical division of costs and benefits obscures health care's true costs and makes it easier to neglect those outside one's group \u2014 by ignoring the fiscal categories to which they are assigned or failing to account for costs in certain categories altogether. 120 The invisibility of care work provided by loved ones \u2014 especially by women to children, the elderly, and the sick \u2014 is a prime example. 121 Third, in a world of scarcity, the division of costs and benefits poses an additional challenge, making marshaling resources for significant investments in public goods with dispersed benefits difficult, susceptible both to coordination failures and collective action problems. Fragmentation it exacerbates the scarcity of resources needed to support a modern public health response. 122 In the U.S. pandemic response, fiscal fragmentation shifted and hid costs and forced false, tragic choices. These effects began years before the pandemic. Fiscal fragmentation impeded efforts to invest in public accomplished by fostering in people a sense of their differences, rather than their commonalities . . . .\"). 119 See WALLACE E.

Section 4002 of the Affordable Care Act created an 18.75 billion dollar Prevention and Public Health Fund \"to provide for expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs to improve health and help restrain the rate of growth in private and public sector health care costs.\" 123 Unfortunately, however, the fund was a sitting duck because it counts as \"mandatory\" federal spending within our fragmented financing system. Budget rules push Congress to cut mandatory funding in existing law whenever it wants to pass a statute that cuts taxes or creates new mandatory spending, but mandatory funding programs are usually protected by powerful interest groups. 124 Public health is a rare exception \u2014 it tends to benefit the public generally, not particular interest groups \u2014 so Congress repeatedly (and tragically) raided the fund in the years leading up to 2020 to offset costly changes in federal law benefiting discrete interests, including the \"doc fix\" and the 2017 tax cuts. 125 It is reasonable to presume that CDC's funding challenges in the years before the pandemic contributed to the agency's testing missteps. Indeed, as early as 2018, observers expressed fear that raiding the Prevention and Public Health Fund would render CDC unable to respond quickly and effectively to a pandemic. \"[W]ithout funding, the CDC won't be able to protect us,\" former CDC Director Tom Frieden observed after one of Congress's raids on the fund in 2018. 126 As a result, he said, \"[w]e're more likely to have to fight dangerous organisms here in the U.S.\"127 Fiscal fragmentation has also stymied investments in the quality of nursing home care and coordination between acute hospital care and long-term care.

In the U.S., much of the cost of daily care for the elderly is borne, by default, by themselves or their loved ones.128 Medicare, which is federally financed, only pays for one hundred days of nursing home or home health care after an enrollee is hospitalized for 3-days.129 The reason for these arbitrary cutoffs is fiscal fragmentation: Medicare's designers worried about tapping the Medicare trust fund for nursing home care, and opted to shift the cost to families and states. 130 Medicaid, which is jointly financed by states and the federal government, is the largest payer of long-term care; about half of nursing home residents either satisfy Medicaid's indigence requirement for coverage or else spend down their assets paying for care until Medicaid kicks in. 131 The arbitrary limits on Medicare-financed nursing home care cause perverse behavioral effects, as families conspire to get their loved ones admitted to hospitals in order to trigger nursing home coverage, or struggle once the 100 days are up to find alternative arrangements. 132 A pandemic that threatens the elderly in particular is a terrible time for families to navigate the fragmented churn through hospitalization, long-term care, and home health. By mid-March of 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") realized that the 3-day rule and 100-day limit threatened to exacerbate the pandemic. 133 It issued an emergency waiver, purporting to relax the 3-day rule and 100-day limit for COVID patients. 134 But fiscal fragmentation is more stubborn: these costs are first born by providers who then seek reimbursement. With a long history of being denied reimbursement, providers continued to apply the old limits, despite the waiver.

Workplaces and schools had reason to push their employees and students to get tested \u2014 for the good of other employees, customers, teachers, and students, and so they could remain open. This was easier said than done, however. The $100 to $199 cost of a COVID test for an asymptomatic person typically has been worth it, in terms of the protective interventions a positive test enables and the assurance a negative test provides. 137 But fiscal fragmentation produced a legal and logistical mismatch between those who benefit from such a test and those in a position to pay. 138 At the start of the pandemic, Congress mandated that insurers pay for coronavirus testing without cost-sharing. 139 But insurers argued that precautionary tests were not covered by insurance contracts to cover \"medically necessary\" care.140 Workplaces and schools, in turn, usually declined to mandate testing 135 See Adam S.

The federal government had an acute fiscal interest in promptly vaccinating residents in long-term care facilities (\"LTCF\"), including skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and residential care homes. When COVID outbreaks hit nursing homes, the resulting hospital treatment expenses are borne primarily by Medicare (which covers hospital care costs without regard to whether a person was previously in a nursing home). 144 Unsurprisingly, then, the federal government aspired to provide and pay for vaccination for all LTCF residents and staff.

Efforts to secure hard-copy consent forms from residents and their family members do not appear to have been motivated by the threat of liability (vaccine administrators are shielded from liability). Rather, the deadly delays caused by consent paperwork appear to have been motivated by third-party billing requirements. 151 Vaccine administration fell far short of projections, except in the one state that declined to rely on the federal program. 152 The fragmentation of responsibility for health costs has contributed to a lack of pandemic preparedness, impeding public health investments. Once the pandemic hit, fragmentation stood in the way of critical interventions with collective benefits. The federal government had the resources to implement a modern public health response but it lacked both the administrative capacity and the political will to displace our fragmented status quo. 3. Federalism Federalism further divides authority for legal interventions in the pandemic response among federal, state, and local governments. It is legally entrenched in the Constitution's enumeration of federal regulatory powers in Article I and its reservation of non-enumerated powers for states in the Tenth Amendment, establishing dual sovereignty. 153 It extends to states' conferral of regulatory power on local authorities via home rule doctrine, creating a second layer of sub-national regulatory power, but one heavily dependent on state sovereign authority. 154 The legal pecking order establishes federal law as supreme 2021/01/24/us/west-virg inia-vaccine.html [htt ps://perma.cc/UZ6W-MFC2 ]; Yuki Noguchi, Why West Virginia's the Race to Get COVID-19 Vaccines Into Arms , NPR (Jan. 7, 2021, 4:16 PM 3UQW-L3P8].

It is found in the political and jurisprudential narratives of comity and deference to state sovereignty and the practical devolution to state authority. 156 Federalism embraces the normative values of state experimentation and local variation within an overarching national system of uniform priorities. 157 Practically, however, the logistical entrenchment of state influence on federal policy \u2014 despite the breadth and supremacy of federal regulatory power \u2014 means that deference to states characterizes federalism as a fixture. 158 Health care federalism has an inconsistent and often ineffective legacy: federal authority dominates the field of regulating medical products, establishing nationwide standards for safety and efficacy and serving as a singular clearinghouse for scientific knowledge on diseases and their diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, and cures. 159 States, however, (2018) (describing a trend of \"aggressive\" and even \"punitive\" trend in state preemption of local laws, as a backlash to local progressive regulation and a violation of home rule). 155 See, e.g. , Lauren E.

A system that depends on private health financing lacks the breadth, capacity, and financial incentives to deliver widespread public health measures, such as testing or vaccination, at levels necessary to be effective and equitable. Instead, our private health insurance system creates cost-barriers to basic public health measures at every step. First, the reliance on employer-based coverage is a significant vulnerability when millions lose their job-based insurance due to the pandemic's economic recession. 194 During the early phase of the pandemic, at least twenty million people lost their jobs,195 which translated to approximately ten million workers and dependents losing their employer-sponsored health coverage,196 3.5 million of whom 193 See Fuse Brown et al., supra note 1, at 416. 194 See Stuart M.

Even for those with coverage, several features of private health insurance (cost-sharing, limited enrollment periods, limited provider networks) work against an effective pandemic response because they create barriers to the widespread testing and vaccination needed to stem the spread. Thus, even for those who maintained their insurance coverage in the pandemic, the coverage itself contains significant holes that expose them to financial shocks. Legal measures were rushed into place by the CARES Act and Families First Coronavirus Response Act (\"FFCRA\") to patch some of these holes in the private health insurance system, namely by prohibiting most types of health coverage from imposing patient cost-sharing for COVID testing or vaccination. 204 Despite these patches, holes remained \u2014 they did not prohibit cost-sharing for COVID treatment, they did not protect against out-of-network charges or cost-sharing for related services (e.g., flu tests, chest x-rays, facility fees, ambulance rides), and services were not covered unless they were deemed medically appropriate by a provider. 205 202 Julie Appleby, Trump's COVID Program for Uninsured People: It Exists, but Falls Short , KHN Obermeyer, Allocation of COVID-19 Relief Funding to Disproportionately Black Counties , 324 JAMA 1000, 1001-02 (2020). 204 Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), Pub.

In a pandemic of a highly contagious virus with asymptomatic transmission, widespread screening of asymptomatic persons is critical to prevent spread. 207 Yet Trump administration guidance on the CARES Act and FFCRA resorted to a private medical model, only requiring insurers to cover the costs of COVID testing for \"diagnostic purposes\" and when deemed \"medically appropriate\" by an individual's attending medical provider. 208 Sabrina Corlette and others argued forcefully that relying upon an insurance model that limits access to diagnostic or medically indicated situations is inadequate because widespread testing for public health purposes is required to track and slow the spread of asymptomatic transmission, particularly in the context of employment or education. 209 To put a finer point on it, widespread testing is necessary for employers, such as nursing homes or meat-packing plants, or schools or universities to carry on their activities safely, but the costs of such testing fall on the institution or individual because they would not be 206 See Sarah Kliff, A $52,112 Air Ambulance Ride: Coronavirus Patients Battle Surprise Bills, N.Y.

The fear of the cost of services creates barriers to widespread testing and vaccination, which foment disease spread; burdens government, private payers, and individuals; and crowds out resources for other social goods needed to address the pandemic's economic and societal dislocation \u2014 such as housing, education, food, or income maintenance.

It demands equitable distribution of the benefits and burdens of public investments in health care and public health. It demands empowerment and self-determination for Black and Brown communities. The third lesson we draw: All four fixtures are rooted in and perpetuate structural racism and subordination based on socioeconomic class, thereby subverting equity and community empowerment. The fixtures' historic and inherent roles in inequity and subordination mean that reforms accommodating them will continue to accommodate inequity and subordination. To begin to address the existential failures, future reforms must confront the fixtures with unswerving resolve. A.

Individualism erodes the social solidarity that underpins mutual aid and community empowerment. Notions of individualism and deservingness have reared their heads again and again in the design and implementation of the ACA. Expansion of Medicaid eligibility beyond the \"deserving poor\" triggered rhetoric reminiscent of Reagan's dog whistles about social welfare programs. 240 The mutual aid principles reflected in guaranteed issue and community rating requirements for private insurers were undercut by a \"personal responsibility\" amendment adopted in the name of giving people incentives for \"wellness.\" 241 Waivers granted by the Trump administration permitting states to impose work requirements as a condition of Medicaid eligibility further entrenched an individualistic ethic of deservingness even as more states have opted into the ACA's Medicaid expansion. 242 Litigation challenging the ACA's individual mandate and Medicaid expansion pressed the limits of majoritarian rule and the communitarian ethos. 243 Challengers asked what individuals can be required by the majority to do for the benefit of the community and what states can be required by the national community to do for those residing within their borders.

Public health emergency prevention and response measures are meant to benefit society as a whole. The burdens should also be shared.\" 245 As Harris and Pamukcu argue, \"[o]ur health is not just an individual matter; it is deeply influenced by institutional and structural forces that shape who has access to the opportunities and resources needed to thrive.\" 246 Viewing health through an individualistic lens obscures the root causes of racial disparities and the structural interventions necessary to realize health justice. Health reforms that go too far in accommodating the fixture of individualism will have limited impact on injustice because, at root, \"social problems need social or collective, not just individual, solutions.\" 247 Deeper commitment to solidarity prompts us to assess the system in terms of its ability to serve \"uniquely public \u2014 as opposed to the mere aggregation of private \u2014 interests.\" 248 To serve solidarity, health reform must embrace collective problem-solving to meet collective needs. To do so justly, it must ensure that the benefits and burdens of public investments in health and public health are equitably distributed and that communities are empowered to protect themselves and others. To realize health justice, health reform must be both universalist and anti-subordinationist. 249 244 See, e.g. , Wiley & Bagenstos, supra note 10, at 1235-36 (\"Elected officials have asked each of us to take personal responsibility for weathering this crisis rather than providing community supports and legal protections that would cushion the blow, spread the costs more widely, and enable everyone to abide by and benefit from public health recommendations.\"). 245 Id. at 1236-37. 246 Harris & Pamukcu, supra note 4, at 762. 247 Fineman, supra note 88, at 141; see Wiley, Health Justice , supra note 8, at 874 (describing \"collective action grounded in community engagement and participatory parity\" as a core commitment of health justice); see also Wiley, Social Justice , supra note 6, at 95 (highlighting \"collective responsibility for assuring healthy living conditions, rather than reinforcing individualistic assumptions about personal responsibility for health\"). 248 Wiley, Health Justice , supra note 8, at 855. 249 Lindsay F.

Fiscal Fragmentation At the most basic level, fiscal fragmentation is a product of two complexes of laws that divide up control over resources within the United States: property laws and fiscal (spending and tax) laws. Both bodies of law have been used as tools of structural racism and subordination. Property laws assign control and ownership of existing and newly generated resources of all types, including land, capital, ideas, and labor. 250 Tax and spending laws, in turn, alter this baseline allocation of resources from the default set by property law, creating additional fragmented pots of money. 251 Tax laws create revenue for government redistribution, and spending laws re-allocate resources or commit resources for future allocation. For example, the Medicare statute commits to Medicare beneficiaries and the providers who serve them reimbursement for covered services, in perpetuity, and funds that entitlement largely by directing payroll taxes into the Medicare trust fund. 252 It thereby creates a discrete pot of national resources that serve a distinct constituency of Medicare beneficiaries253 \u2014 just as property laws create millions of pots of resources that serve distinct constituencies of property owners. The higher reimbursement rates paid to providers for services rendered to patients covered by Medicare (including for COVID testing and vaccination) incentivize more outreach to those patients than to Medicaid beneficiaries, whose coverage is more precariously financed and whose providers receive substantially less generous reimbursement rates. 254 The fragmentation of the nation's wealth and redistributive programs is not random; it creates, perpetuates, and reflects subordination. The baseline of property ownership locks in and carries forward any unaddressed inequity in wealth or the means to generate it. Thus, Black Americans today control less, and have less, because their ancestors 250 See generally David A. Super, A New New Property , 113 C OLUM . L. REV. 1773, 1778-80 (2013) (describing nature and purposes of property law). 251 See Daniel Shaviro, Rethinking Tax Expenditures and Fiscal Language , 57 T AX L.

Watson, Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act: Civil Rights, Health Reform, Race, and Equity , 55 H OW. L.J. 855, 868 (2012) (\"Physicians tend to avoid Medicaid patients primarily, but not exclusively, because reimbursement rates are often lower than for privately insured and Medicare patients.\"). 718 University of California, Davis [Vol. 55:657 were able to pass less on to them \u2014 at first because they were prohibited from owning property, even their own labor, and then because of systematic discrimination in access to education, jobs, equal pay, housing, and health care. Similarly, the creation and separation of spending programs through which the nation alters the baseline distribution of property has not been neutral to subordination, either. It has favored powerful groups and disfavored the powerless. 255 Thus, programs like Medicare and Social Security that benefit the middle class are sturdy, with permanent federal funding flows protected from disruption \u2014 government \"shutdowns\" do not hurt Medicare beneficiaries. 256 Meanwhile, programs that predominantly benefit the poorest Americans and communities, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\"SNAP\"), are fiscally fragile. They require annual appropriations just to keep operating and, therefore, are susceptible to sabotage or hostage-taking by the House, Senate, and President \u2014 as the weeks-long lapse in SNAP benefits during the 2019 government shutdown illustrated. 257 Because fiscal fragmentation reflects subordination, it propagates it. Fiscal fragmentation makes inequity durable. There are many good arguments in favor of durability in property ownership and spending programs like Medicare, but that durability comes at the cost of entrenching inequity. 258 Furthermore, fiscal fragmentation facilitates the nation's failure to offer a robust response to all its residents' health needs. It allows us to conceptualize poverty, want of health care, and want of health investment as individual or community failures, what economists call \"wealth effects,\" rather than as the societal choices they ultimately are. C. Federalism The concept of shared sovereignty is not unavoidably racist. But the historical and political manifestations of deference to state authority in American federalism are racist in origin and perpetuate 255 DANIEL E.

Medicaid serves as a prime example. Congress enacted Medicaid in 1965 as part of the Great Society reforms targeting discrimination and poverty. 266 Since then, a series of legislative waivers and administrative policies have ceded control of program design increasingly to the states. 267 Southern states and those politically aligned with them have frequently wielded this \"flexibility\" to exclude and subordinate people of color from the program's reach, eroding the federal floor of protection.268 This \"fend- for-yourself\" federalism and policy devolution \"has led to states developing welfare sanctions that disproportionately harm low-income Blacks . . . .\" 269 The Supreme Court's decision in 2012 to make the ACA's Medicaid expansion subject to states' discretion has meant that a similar grouping of states have refused to expand Medicaid, allowing racial disparities in coverage to persist in non-expansion states while narrowing disparities in expansion states. 270 In addition to eroding nationwide protections for subordinated populations, the devolution to state sovereignty treads on the abilities of local communities to protect their own populations through state preemption of local government action. 271 Preemption, as Harris and Pamucku have argued, is \"[a] potential danger to [the] innovations in 265 Id. 266 See generally Dayna Bowen Matthew, The \"New Federalism\" Approach to Medicaid: Empirical Evidence that Ceding Inherently Federal Authority to the States Harms Public Health , 90 K Y.

For example, when COVID infections and deaths spiked in the Atlanta region, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms implemented policies for face-covering and restricting business openings to stanch the trend. 277 Georgia Governor Brian Kemp sued her, asserting that state- level policy of not requiring masks and not requiring public accommodation closures preempted these local public health measures. 278 Other conservative states entertained similar arguments to 272 Harris & Pamukcu, supra note 4, at 827. 273 Derek Carr, Sabrina Adler, Benjamin D.

In the words of Deborah Stone, the market-based logic of the private health insurance system is \"profoundly antithetical to the idea of mutual aid.\" 291 Private insurance market principles are based on actuarial fairness, where each person pays for his own risk, and the insurance profit model depends on fragmenting the risk pool into ever smaller, more homogenous groups. 292 Moreover, the actuarial methodology of insurance historically incorporated the social biases and subordination of people of color, who tend to be poorer and live and work in communities designated as higher risk.293 The U.S.'s private insurance system treats health care as a market good \u2014 allocated based on the ability to pay \u2014 which means poorer communities, which are disproportionately Black and Brown, always have worse health care access and quality. 294 By contrast, other developed countries treat health care as a public good, to be distributed based on need and funded collectively.295 It is this organizing market-principle of actuarial fairness and its rejection of mutual aid principles, not the mere presence of private insurance companies (which many countries with universal social insurance programs have) 296 that connect the U.S. private health insurance system with its racially inequitable outcomes.297 The nail in the inequitable coffin is that the two-tiered U.S. health care system pays providers less to care for patients with public insurance than those with private insurance.298 Price discrimination, 291 Stone, supra note 8, at 290. 292 Id. 293 Id. at 296-97 (describing how underwriting methodology tracks social class, stereotypes, and occupational categories). 294 See Thomas Rice, The Impact of Cost Containment Efforts on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Healthcare: A Conceptualization , in UNEQUAL TREATMENT , supra note 6, 699-70 (concluding that the U.S. approach to cost containment exacerbates racial disparities, particularly by allocating services based on the ability to pay). 295 SMITH , supra note 285, at 28. 296 Roosa Tikkanen, Variations on a Theme: A Look at Universal Health Coverage in Eight Countries , T HE COMMONWEALTH FUND (Mar. 22, 2019), https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2019/universal-health-coverage-eight-countries [https://perma.cc/8FJT-4ZJA]. 297 See Stone, supra note 8, at 291. 298 See UNEQUAL TREATMENT , supra note 6, at 190 (\"Low payment rates inhibit the supply of . . . provider[] services to low-income groups, disproportionately affecting ethnic minorities.

Health care price discrimination translates into racial discrimination, because a patient's coverage type maps onto a patient's racial, economic, and social status. 300 In the U.S. health care system, lower provider payments by public payers translate to reduced access, particularly in Medicaid, the public program for the poor and the principal source of coverage for minorities. 301 Everyone knows that Medicaid is a poor payer, Medicare slightly better, and private coverage the most lucrative.302 Price discrimination means providers are always more willing and eager to serve a privately insured patient (including for COVID testing and vaccination) than a publicly insured one and validates negative attitudes against minority, low-income communities. 303 Low reimbursement rates depress provider participation in Medicaid, and Medicaid beneficiaries have far worse access to health care than privately insured patients. 304 This explains the paradox of how Medicare, Medicaid, and 299 Rice, supra note 294, at 712; Uwe E.

A privatized system generally does a worse job of fairly distributing health care resources across the population \u2014 by favoring the wealthy and disadvantaging the poor, and charging fees that deter poorer patients from seeking or continuing care \u2014 and these distributional inequities translate to greater disparities in health outcomes. 310 Privatized health care tends to be more inequitable. Thus, even if everyone has coverage, a private health care system will perpetuate inequality along racial and socioeconomic lines unless it is heavily regulated to resemble a public system of coverage with standardized provider payment rates and benefits. Even in countries with universal public coverage systems, where providers typically are not paid more to serve rich patients than poor ones, there is an observed social gradient in health status. 311 A universal single-payer health care system does not fully eliminate the health effects of income inequality, structural racism, and other social determinants of health. 312 But health inequalities and disparities cannot be addressed without a universal system of coverage under which providers are paid the same amounts to treat all persons.313 Moreover, 309 Sanjay Basu, Jason Andrews, Sandeep Kishore, Rajesh Panjabi & David Stuckler, Comparative Performance of Private and Public Healthcare Systems in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review , 9 PL OS MED. e1001244, at 1, 5-8 (2012). 310 ASSA & CALDERON , supra note . .

However, the iron triangle ethos equated access with coverage and was not particularly concerned whether the coverage was equal or the benefits and burdens of such health care were justly distributed. A health justice framework would not be satisfied with universal coverage if it perpetuated a fragmented health care system where wealthier, socially dominant groups benefit from generous private coverage with broad access to enthusiastic providers and poorer, socially subordinated groups are covered by public programs with constrained access to reluctant providers. * * * Individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization perpetuate inequity and subordination in our health care system on a tragic scale. To reconstruct a system on the health justice model, future reforms must confront the fixtures. IV. L ESSON 4: HEALTH REFORM RECONSTRUCTION REQUIRES CONFRONTATIONAL INCREMENTALISM The pandemic has instructed us that health reform needs nothing short of a reconstruction in ethos, centered on health justice criteria. We have learned that the entrenched fixtures of individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization sow dysfunction in our health care system and tragically perpetuate inequitable burdens of disease. The health justice ethos \u2014 with its commitments to anti- racism, equitable distribution of burdens and benefits, and community empowerment \u2014 demands confrontation with these fixtures. But their logistical entrenchment may practically compel an incremental method. We must dig deep for our concluding lesson about how health reform might reconcile bolder goals with sharper pragmatism about the fixtures' obstruction of those goals: confrontational incrementalism offers an agenda that makes health reform reconstruction possible. 314 See, e.g. , Wiley, supra note 15, at 891 (\"By eliminating (or dramatically reducing) fragmentation in health care financing, single-payer health care could better align incentives between the health care and public health systems. . . . Under a single-payer system, there would be near-total overlap between the primary payer for health care goods and services (taxpayers) and those who exercise control over the most crucial social determinants of health (voters).\") 2021] Health Reform Reconstruction 729 A. Envisioning a Just U.S. Health System Applying the bolder criteria of health justice, what would an anti- racist, equitable, empowering, and solidarity-enhancing health system look like? Such a transformed U.S. health system would eliminate, displace, or transcend the four legally and logistically entrenched fixtures that have led to the functional and existential failures laid bare by the COVID pandemic. The lessons of the pandemic have strengthened the case for a single-payer health care system in the U.S. \u2014 a universal social insurance program that is grounded in solidarity, distributes its benefits based on need, allocates its financing burdens by the ability to pay, and empowers affected communities in decision- making processes. 315 Such a single-payer system would displace the fixture of individualism within health care by enrolling everyone into a shared program from cradle to grave, providing every person in the country the same right to a comprehensive array of health care services. 316 It could also embrace public health principles, strengthening the recognition of health as a public good and prioritizing resources toward the enhancement of the population's health, including addressing systemic racial and social inequities that are themselves a public health crisis. 317 Adopting a universal, single-payer system in the U.S. would eradicate the ethos of actuarial fairness, under which everyone pays for their own risk, and move decisively toward social solidarity where health care and public health are public goods, not commodities. 318 A universal, single-payer system would also collapse the fixtures of fiscal fragmentation and privatization by combining all participants in 315 See Bloche, supra note 29, at 300 (arguing that \"in a democracy,\" the \"principle function\" of health law should be to manage conflicting \"hopes and expectations for the health care system\" we have \"as individuals and as public-regarding citizens\"); Fuse Brown et al., supra note 1, at 419-23 (describing how national single-payer proposals confront the fixtures more directly than the ACA did); Hunter, supra note 43, at 1959 (arguing that practices arising out of health reform \"have the potential to lead to new discourses and understandings about the interrelationship between individualism and collectivity, and about the public and private dimensions of the health system\"); Stone, supra note 8, at 291 (\"Under a social insurance scheme, individuals are entitled to receive whatever care they need, and the amounts they pay to finance the scheme are totally unrelated to the amount or cost of care they actually use.\"); Wiley, Privatized Public Health Insurance , supra note 61 (discussing the role of democratic deliberation in the design and administration of public insurance programs). 316 See Fuse Brown et al., supra note 1, at 422; see, e.g. , Medicare for H.R. 1384, 116th Cong. (2019-2020) (proposing a national single-payer health system that would cover all U.S. residents automatically at birth or upon residency in the U.S.). 317 See YEARBY ET AL ., supra note 227, at 7-8. 318 BYRD & CLAYTON , supra note 285, at 585. 730 University of California, Davis [Vol. 55:657 a single, unified risk pool.319 With a single payer rather than fiscal diffusion across multiple payers, the system could coordinate and marshal resources in times of emergency. It could provide the \"national grid for the generation, transmission, or distribution\" of supplies that Atul Gawande has argued that the US lacks. 320 A single-payer system could also confront fiscal fragmentation by applying administratively set payment rates across the population, eliminating unjust payment differentials so that providers would no longer be paid more to care for wealthier patients than poorer ones. Importantly, a universal system would eliminate the segmentation of the population into tiers of unequal private and public coverage that reify existing racial and socioeconomic disparities in health care access and outcomes. 321 Publicly financed health systems are more equitable and produce better outcomes than privatized systems. Health care user fees and lack of access to a private health plan would no longer be a barrier for disadvantaged people to access needed care, whether in a public health emergency or in more routine circumstances. Likewise, a single nationwide single-payer program would confront federalism. It could flatten many of the state-by-state disparities that flow from federalism's deference to state flexibility. 322 A federal program could advance health justice by redistributing the burdens and benefits of public investments in health care at a national level \u2014 rather than relying on state financing that varies widely. Other countries offer a variety of visions for what a single-payer, universal health care system looks like. 323 Some have greater reliance on private health insurance contractors to administer the benefits, others retain more federalist flexibility. 324 We do not have to invent our 319 See Fuse Brown et al., supra note 1, at 419-21. 320 Gawande, supra note 173. 321 See SMITH , supra note 285, at 29-30. 322 See generally JAMILA MICHENER , FRAGMENTED DEMOCRACY : MEDICAID , FEDERALISM , AND UNEQUAL POLITICS (Cambridge Univ.

We benefit from being the last wealthy country on earth without such a system. 325 The difficulty lies not with a lack of blueprints or models, but rather from the fact that no country has ever gotten there from here . The prospect of overcoming the fixtures in the U.S. to achieve this transformed, universal, single-payer health care system seems daunting and possibly even na\u00efve. B. Health Reform Is Hard Perhaps COVID will usher in a new era in which the U.S. finds the will to begin the dramatic transformation it needs. Because access to health care is one among many social determinants of health, realizing health justice will also require action in other sectors. But a more just health system, integrating public health and health equity goals into legal frameworks for health care financing and delivery, is an important pre-condition for health justice. The pandemic undeniably affects the political and economic climate for health reform and therefore may affect the feasibility of pursuing bolder reforms based on health justice. The public health and economic crises of the pandemic may have accelerated the public's embrace of a greater government role in health care, untethered from employment, and willingness to confront structural inequalities of a fragmented, privatized, \"you're on your own\" non-system. 326 Moreover, while we argue for a more principled ethos in which solidarity supports health justice, interest-convergence theory327 also suggests that the pandemic may have added to the utility of social solidarity. That is, the pandemic may have made it more obvious to dominant racial and social groups in the U.S. that empowering subordinated populations aligns with their own interests. Interest- 325 See JACOBS & SKOCPOL , supra note 17, at 3 (\"Universal health care was established in one way or another in every other industrial or industrializing nation. But in the United States, health care reformers (as advocates of universal coverage are labeled) have run into bitter political opposition and, every time, fall short of achieving guaranteed coverage or all citizens.\"). 326 See Victor R. Fuchs & Ezekiel J. Emanuel, Health Care (2005) (predicting that the will for comprehensive health reform may require major upheaval such as a \"national health crisis, such as a flu pandemic\"). 327 See Mary Crossley, Black Health Matters: Disparities, Community Health, and Interest Convergence , 22 M ICH. J. RACE & L. 53, 58 (2016). 732 University of California, Davis [Vol. 55:657 convergence does not make health justice more normatively desirable, but it does suggest that it might be more feasible. With all of that said, such transformational health reform may seem hopeless or at least unimaginably hard.328 The pandemic has vitiated any pretense that our current health care financing and delivery system is effective or just \u2014 it is profoundly ineffective and unjust. And it has shown that what is needed is not just the will for health justice, but a way. Substantial fixtures are blocking the path toward health system transformation. 329 So long as the blinkered \"iron triangle\" approach remains dominant in law and policy analysis, reform will not even aspire to a just health system, guaranteeing we will not actualize it.330 And in the political realm, the prospect of a dramatic change brought about through federal legislation like \"Medicare for All\" has seemingly receded, once again, into the future \u2014 as it has been doing for decades. 331 At the same time, even if a bolder vision of a just health system gains steam in policy and political circles, the road to creating such a system in the United States is difficult because of the structural impediments we have described.332 As this Article has demonstrated, the distance 328 See JACOBS & SKOCPOL , supra note 17, at ch. 5 (asking whether the more modest reforms of the ACA will survive special interest lobbying by the powerful industry groups, whether federalism will undermine implementation, and whether it will collapse under budgetary pressures). 329 See, e.g. , Patrice A.

Schill eds., 2015) (highlighting that health reforms are difficult because they \"directly implicate many of the most sensitive ideological cleavages in our society\"); Gabriel Scheffler, Equality and Sufficiency in Health Care Reform , 81 M D. L. REV. (forthcoming 2021) (on file with authors) (comparing the normative principles underlying differing conceptions of a \"right to health care\" in single-payer or more incremental reforms). 2021] Health Reform Reconstruction 733 between conception and execution is great, and the law is often a barrier to reform, not a facilitator. When the country musters the impulse for solidarity in health care as it did in the spring of 2020, that impulse crashes against entrenched, isolating, dispersive fixtures \u2014 individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization \u2014 and stalls. These quasi-legal structures ensure that the solidarity impulse does not translate into solidarity in practice. We have focused on COVID and racial disparities here, but history offers other examples, including the ACA itself. 333 C. Confrontational Incrementalism To achieve anything approaching health justice, reform must overcome the fixtures that constrain it. This will require transformation, which may ultimately require a single-payer health system. Incremental reforms that fall short of transformation must be evaluated not based on their marginal progress on quality-cost-access metrics or some proxy endpoint like \"universal coverage,\" but instead on the extent to which they reinforce or undermine the fixtures. Incremental reforms that reinforce the fixtures are counter-productive even if they entail modest coverage gains. But, incremental reforms that undermine or transform fixtures could be a step forward, perhaps regardless of their immediate impacts on coverage. To deal with both the necessity of transforming our health care system and the apparent impossibility of doing so, we believe health law and policy must develop a strategy for confrontational incrementalism \u2014 a method for identifying incremental reforms that challenge, displace, or transcend the regressive fixtures we have described and, so, plant the seeds for future transformation. Confrontational incrementalism begins by distinguishing conceptually between incremental reforms that serve as stepping stones (which represent progress toward fundamental change) and those that serve as stumbling blocks (which distract from fundamental change). Crucially, confrontational incrementalism also requires frank assessment of the extent to which incremental reforms confront legally and logistically entrenched structures that prevent transformation. Incremental reforms that tend to dismantle those structures are stepping stones and reforms that accommodate those structures are 333 See Fuse Brown et al., supra note 1, 414-17. 734 University of California, Davis [Vol. 55:657 stumbling blocks. Examples from past health reforms inform this approach.334 Our call for confrontational incrementalism traces an agenda for health reform reconstruction. It does not conclude the project. This methodological focus reveals the value of further research into the way fixtures are created and, more importantly, how they may be dismantled \u2014 not only in health reform but also in other legal fields where reconstruction is necessary. 1. Stepping Stones or Stumbling Blocks The COVID pandemic has revealed just how far the United States is from a just and equitable health care system. This leaves a fundamental question for reform \u2014 should we accept incremental reforms or hold out for transformation? If, for example, we accept that modest coverage expansions like a \"public option\" in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces would fall far short, what should we make of such reforms? Are they to be avoided as a distraction from the transformation that must take place, or embraced as a step in the right direction? Incrementalism is not a question merely for health policy. In drug policy, scholars and policymakers must decide whether to seek reform through the criminal justice system, or hold out to decriminalize substance use disorder. 335 In policing, scholars and policymakers must decide between fundamental reform (or abolition) or modest gains.336 And in environmental policy, scholars and policymakers must decide whether to accept modest reforms if they fail to fully mitigate and prepare for climate change. 337 Unpacking incrementalism in environmental policy, Rachel Brewster distinguishes among different incremental reforms based on whether they are \"stepping stones\" or \"stumbling blocks.\" 338 Stumbling blocks turn out to be \"a barrier that make advancement more difficult.\"339 334 See, e.g. , Fuchs & Emanuel, supra note 326, at 1408 (comparing incremental versus comprehensive reform). 335 John Kip Cornwell, Opioid Courts and Judicial Management of the Opioid Crisis , 49 SETON HALL L. REV. 997, 1005 (2019) (discussing controversy surrounding whether to employ drug courts or abandon them as \"fundamentally incompatible with the disease model of addiction\"). 336 See Dorothy E. Roberts, Foreword: Abolition Constitutionalism , 133 H ARV. L. REV. 1, 11-12 (2019) (describing abolition movement in criminal justice reform). 337 Rachel Brewster, Stepping Stone or Stumbling Block: Incrementalism and National Climate Change Legislation , 28 Y ALE L. & POL'Y REV. 245, 246 (2010). 338 Id. 339 Id. 2021] Health Reform Reconstruction 735 Stepping stones \"eas[e] the way to climbing higher.\"340 In assessing the difference, Brewster stresses the importance of considering not only the static effects of a reform (\"what the immediate and direct effects of the policy are\") but also its dynamic effects (\"how the measure will affect the system,\" including \"longer-term and indirect effect[s]\" and alterations to \"incentives for private and public actors\"). 341 This is an essential framework and an important, partial defense of incrementalism. Yes, we should not accept any goal short of transformation to a just and equitable health system. But that alone does not render reforms short of that goal undesirable. To realize health justice, the confrontational incrementalist approach to health reform must be anti-subordinationist. 342 Assessing whether any particular incremental reform is a stepping stone or a stumbling blocks is key to this effort. In some sense, whether an incremental reform is a stepping stone or a stumbling block is a political judgment for elected officials and movement leaders. Will implementing a modest reform use up political energy that could eventually be channeled into transformation? Or will it demonstrate the success that will both maintain a movement's momentum and make the next step forward a smaller one? That said, the relevance of such political judgments may be overstated, as shifting political dynamics make any prediction about how choices today will impact the will of the voters (or the politicians they elect) in some future year inaccurate indeed. Differentiating stepping stones and stumbling blocks is also a legal question. Because the fixtures we have identified impede social solidarity and propagate subordination in health care, the question of whether to pursue reforms that fall short of the needed transformation depends on how those reforms interact with the legal entrenchment of individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization. 2. Applying Confrontational Incrementalism to Pre-pandemic Reforms Measuring incremental reforms' degree of confrontation with the fixtures will be hard work. As a starting place, we can find historical examples of health reforms that, on an impressionistic basis, appear positive or negative from the standpoint of confrontational incrementalism. 340 Id. 341 Id. at 250-51. 342 See Harris & Pamukcu, supra note 4, at 762. 736 University of California, Davis [Vol. 55:657 Medicare's enactment in 1965 may be an example of a stepping stone. The law partially confronted privatization (established as a public program), individualism (automatic enrollment), fiscal fragmentation (federally-financed without segmentation), and federalism (federally administered). 343 Not surprisingly, the law is today understood as a template for universal, single-payer, federally-run health care.344 Given Medicare's success in confronting the fixtures, it is no wonder that \"Medicare for All\" has become the shorthand for such a system. 345 It's worth remembering, however, that Medicare's confrontations, while substantial, were partial . Medicare preserved a role for private contractors in benefits administration (in addition to preserving private health care delivery systems). 346 It also preserved fiscal fragmentation to some degree by segregating eligible enrollees from other risk pools. By this same analysis, Medicare Part D, which added pharmaceutical coverage to the program, was more of a stumbling block. The program, spearheaded by the George W. Bush Administration, changed a largely government-run program into a fully-privatized program by relying on private insurers to administer virtually every aspect of it. 347 This private insurance model meant individual premiums, significant cost-sharing, and risk selection \u2014 importing an ethic of individualism and actuarial fairness into Medicare. Moreover, by explicitly keeping the Medicare program out of drug pricing, it failed to leverage administrative rate setting to keep drug prices (and costs to enrollees) in check. 348 Thus, Medicare Part D invites Medicare enrollees to see themselves as individual consumers rather than participants in a public program. In this sense, Medicare Part D was a stumbling block because it primarily accommodated rather than confronted the fixtures that constrain reform. Under this analysis, the ACA was a mixed bag. The law's coverage gains themselves actually came through designs that, because they tried 343 See Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, Governing Medicare , 51 A DMIN . L.

The law did, however, directly attack the individualism fixture in two ways: the individual mandate (requiring everyone to purchase insurance) and community rating coupled with the ban on preexisting condition exclusions (requiring everyone to share in the costs of one another's illness). 349 Though the individual mandate did not endure,350 the ACA's ban on preexisting condition exclusions won the confrontation with individualism, shifting the public's view on preexisting conditions. 351 That reform \u2014 and not the law's coverage gains \u2014 is perhaps the clearest example of an incremental stepping stone, precisely because it confronted a fixture of American law. Confrontational incrementalism can be applied to assess proposed reforms. It does not necessarily provide definitive answers, but it does reframe the debate around the extent to which trade-offs among the four fixtures progress toward health justice or further entrench the status quo. 352 Consider public option reforms. A federal public option plan could extend eligibility to everyone, create a large and unified risk pool of previously fragmented ones, offer broad benefits and provider participation, improve affordability through aggressive rate setting, and offer additional financial supports for low-income and high-cost patients. 353 Such a public option reform would confront all four fixtures to some extent and likely be a stepping-stone toward health justice.

For example, the policy could grant states the ability to combine their Medicaid population with their public option plan, equalizing payment rates and unifying the inequitable two-tiered public-private health care system that pays more to providers for seeing privately insured patients than publicly insured. Overall such a plan could be a stepping-stone toward a just and equitable health system, even if it did not confront all the fixtures simultaneously. For contrast, consider a public option that is only offered on the marketplaces (and is thus unavailable to Medicaid beneficiaries and undocumented immigrants), leaves untouched most employer-based coverage, is administered and financed by private health insurers, and applies modest provider rate controls with correspondingly modest effects on the market. A public option thus designed would accommodate the fixtures and would not move us any closer to the goal of a just health care system, even if it provided more choices and modest cost savings to some enrollees. 355 Such an accommodating public option could constitute a stumbling block if it consumes all the political capital and energy for reform, but merely reinforces the fixtures and all their attendant problems. 3. Applying Confrontational Incrementalism During the Pandemic Realizing health justice \u2014 especially during a pandemic \u2014 requires legal protections and supports that extend well beyond access to medical countermeasures, including measures to secure safe and healthy housing, worker protections, basic income support, food security, and more. Here, our focus is on medical countermeasures. Although testing and vaccination campaigns have been plagued by inadequacies and inequities, there are examples of interventions that incrementally confront the fixtures we have described. Some of the most successful approaches from a health justice perspective have been place-based interventions that inherently confront the fixture of individualism. By prioritizing access to scarce resources for testing and vaccination based on census tracts, worksites, and other institutional settings, place-based strategies recognize the 354 Wiley, Privatized Public Health Insurance , supra note 61, at 2161 (discussing potential political expedience of private provision of public coverage). 355 Jaime S.

(forthcoming 2022). 2021] Health Reform Reconstruction 739 importance of individuals' connections with the communities where they live and work. The Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program is an example of a place-based approach.356 It confronts federalism by creating a nationwide distribution mechanism, but its hands-off approach to privatization and its failure to confront fiscal fragmentation left it poorly coordinated and underfunded. 357 Depending exclusively on third-party reimbursement based on the insurance status of each individual resident or worker who receives a vaccination was a major stumbling block. Relying on profit-motivated pharmacy chains to mobilize vaccination teams without public oversight contributed to failures of coordination, transparency, and accountability. Ironically, state governors were blamed for \"doses sitting on shelves\" at a point when most of those doses appeared to be sitting on shelves owned by CVS and Walgreens. While the pharmacy chains held up vaccine administration to obtain hard-copy consent forms for billing purposes, state government officials were being criticized for the deficits between doses shipped and doses administered. A better example (though one that benefits from state flexibility under a federalism framework, rather than confronting it) was West Virginia's program for vaccinating nursing home residents and staff. West Virginia was the only state to entirely opt-out of the federal program for vaccinating long-term care residents and workers. 358 The state's governor and health department opted to launch their own program. Well-funded state and local health departments played match-maker between individual long-term care facilities and local pharmacies and provided ongoing guidance and oversight to ensure smooth administration. 359 The state was the first in the nation to offer full vaccination to all residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities. 360 Rhode Island has pioneered a place-based approach to prioritization for COVID vaccines and to ensuring just distribution of the benefits of 356 See Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Health and Hum.

The governor and health department designated entire \"hard-hit\" communities for the first phase of vaccine distribution based exclusively on geography. 361 Place-based prioritization \u2014 based on pandemic-related indicators like test positivity and hospitalization rate, as well as pre-pandemic tools like CDC's social vulnerability index 362 \u2014 directly confronts the structural racism and economic subordination that have driven COVID disparities by actively prioritizing communities where higher-risk workplaces and crowded multi-generation homes contribute to high exposure. 363 After prioritizing entire communities, the state health department partnered with local housing authorities, employers, and civil society groups to send mobile teams and pop-up vaccination sites directly to the places where people live and work and vaccinate anyone on-site who's willing, without asking for documentation of individual eligibility factors or insurance information. 364 These partnerships focused on empowering local communities. They confronted individualism by focusing on neighborhood-level factors and the interconnectedness between individuals and the communities where they live, work, shop, and attend school. They confronted privatization (incrementally, but also intentionally) by ensuring strong public coordination and oversight. They failed to confront federalism, but in this case, state-level experimentation and on-the-ground implementation may have had some advantages. Another incremental approach is to confront fiscal fragmentation by equalizing reimbursement rates for Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance.

But rate equalization's confrontation of fiscal fragmentation marks a significant, stepping-stone improvement. * * * Successful examples of confrontational incrementalism within the pandemic point to important lessons of their own. It may well be that accommodating one fixture as part of a trade-off that allows for greater confrontation with other fixtures provides an important path forward. Vaccination programs in West Virginia and other states took advantage of federalism and public-private partnerships to confront individualism and fiscal fragmentation. Similarly, Washington's public option reform accommodates federalism and privatization while confronting individualism and fiscal fragmentation. These trade-offs among the four fixtures merit further attention in follow-up projects. Here, our point is simply that examining trade-offs among individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization offers a new framework for evaluating health reforms aimed at anti-subordination, just distribution of the benefits and burdens of public investments in health care and public health, and community empowerment. Trade-offs among health care access, quality, and cost are insufficient to explain or inform the next steps in health reform reconstruction. 365 Philip Marcelo, 2 Hard-Hit Cities, 2 Diverging Fates in Vaccine Dayal McCluskey, In Surprise Baker Administration Sets High Insurance Payments for Vaccinations , B OS.

The lessons of the pandemic have made the case for reconstructing health reform to confront the four fixtures in ways that realize health justice. Reformers should seize the moment \u2014 the public health, racial, and economic crises of the pandemic have accelerated the public's embrace of a greater government role in health care and bolstered our willingness to confront the structural inequities of a fragmented, privatized, \"you're on your own\" system. But it is critical for reformers to ensure that they do no further harm by entrenching the fixtures we have identified here. Regardless of whether reformers seek to realize health justice in one leaping transformation or tack toward it incrementally, we provide a methodology \u2014 confrontational incrementalism \u2014 to chart the course. The post-pandemic period will be a critical inflection point. The COVID pandemic offers lessons about the what , the how, and the why of future reforms to the U.S. health system. Similar lessons will also guide reforms in other spheres implicated in pandemic devastation. The deep entrenchment and path-dependent reification of individualism, fiscal fragmentation, federalism, and privatization make it nearly impossible to displace these fixtures wholesale. But abandoning the haphazard accommodation of the fixtures, which fatally constrained pre-2020 health reform, is a critical step in the right direction. Given the enormity of the U.S. health system's failures during the pandemic, we put forth an ambitious proposal. It is time to exit the iron triangle era in which health reforms are assessed solely in terms of health care access, quality, and costs. We must work toward a bolder goal of realizing health justice by centering anti-subordination, equitable distribution of burdens and benefits (for which access, quality, and cost are useful, but not exhaustive, metrics), and community empowerment. This will require confronting the structural fixtures that have hobbled the country's pandemic response and reinforced racial and social subordination in our health care system. Armed with a new conceptual framework (health justice), the diagnosis (the four fixtures) and the treatment (confrontational incrementalism), health reform reconstruction is possible. 368 JOHN W.
