A number of second and third generation vaccines are also under development. We have developed a tool box of in vivo and in vitro tests to evaluate the efficacy of traditional and novel vaccines. The tests include macrophage cell lysis, antigen and antibody ELISAs for the three toxin components, a FRET assay for LF activity, lethal toxin neutralisation, mouse potency assays and rabbit efficacy challenge model. The assays (except for FRET) have been validated and data generated used to support regulatory submissions. These tests have been used to characterise a number of vaccines. 2 Efficacy Assessment of Anthrax Vaccines Outline of talk Anthrax vaccines Vaccine efficacy Efficacy vs potency? Efficacy and the product lifecycle Issues Analytical methods to support efficacy testing of anthrax vaccines Example data Conclusions 3 Efficacy Assessment of Anthrax Vaccines Vaccine efficacy.....what is it? \"The percentage reduction in disease incidence in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group\" \"Efficacy is best measured in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trials\" Potency testing is performed to demonstrate the capacity of the product to confer protective immunity 5 Efficacy Assessment of Anthrax Vaccines Efficacy testing and the product (vaccine) lifecycle 6 Efficacy Assessment of Anthrax Vaccines Phase3 Phase2 Phase1 INDapplication Pre-clinical animal models ValidationDiscovery Discovery (3-5 years) Development (5-10 years) Develop manufacturing process Formulation / stability GMP manufacture Regulatory submission Approval for sale Product Support Issues/Challenges 7 Efficacy Assessment of Anthrax Vaccines Anthrax vaccines present issues that impact on regulatory compliance & efficacy testing Population not normally exposed to hazard Field trials after accidental or hostile exposure not usually feasible Unusual route of infection Need to respond rapidly 'Normal' licensure may present unacceptable risk - Takes too long - Cannot conduct human challenge/protection studies - Surrogate markers (correlates of protection)?

The in vivo phase, where mice are vaccinated on Days 0 and 14 with the prepared doses and bled on Day 28. The in vitro phase, where mouse serum is tested in the mouse Toxin Neutralisation Assay (mTNA). A dose dilution series is used, with 10 CD1 mice per dose for the test batches and reference batch. The dose response of the test batches is compared to the reference batch generating a relative potency (RP) value.
