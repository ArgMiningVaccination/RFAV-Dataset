Executive S ummar y Consuming a healthy d iet can help individuals achieve and maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases, and promote good health. Research in the field of nutrition often focuses on single nutrie nts, foods, and/or food groups. W hile looking at components of the diet individually is important to examine the effects of various aspects of the diet on health , foods and nutrients are eaten in a variety of combinations and can have interactive and potentially cumulative or confounding relationship s. Thus, when developing guidance on the types of foods, beverages, and nutrients to consume, i t is important to consider research on individual components of the diet , as well as research that examines dietary patterns. For the purpose of this systematic review project, a dietary pattern is defined as t he quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. As noted in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for American s,1 there are several ways that a healthy diet can be achieved. The purpose of this project was to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and outcomes of public health concern . Background and Methodology USDA's Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL) conducted these systematic reviews . The NEL uses a rigorous, transparent, and reproducible methodology to conduct systematic reviews on food- and nutrition -related topics to support Federal nutrition policies and programs . The six -step process includes : 1. Systematic review question development 2. Literature search, screening, and selection 3. Data extraction and quality assessment 4. Describing the evidence and evidence synthesis 5. Developing conclusion statements and grading the evidence 6. Identifying research recommendations. This NEL systematic review project was planned, organized, and guided by a NEL Systematic Review Management Team composed of Federal nutritionists trained in systematic review methodology. The NEL System atic Review Management Team worked with a Technical Expert Collaborative (TEC ) that consisted of seven national nutrition experts with knowledge in various aspects of dietary pattern s. A broad range of expertise was needed to address specific issues related to the topic of dietary patterns and to guide synthesis of the body of evidence to answer the systematic review questions posed. A Stakeholder Group, which included Federal employees who represented end - users of the review and possessed varying perspectives and expertise related to dietary patterns , provided input throughout the process. Systematic Review Questions At the initiation of the project, the NEL held a workshop with the TEC members, Stakeholder Group, and invited speakers to discuss the various methodologies used to assess dietary patterns and to help inform the approach for the project. Following the workshop, t he TEC identified and prioritized specific systematic review questions addressi ng dietary patterns and outcomes of public health concern . The NEL Systematic Review Management Team helped to focus the questions on outcomes of public health importance that could potentially inform Federal nutrition policies and programs. The questions were also reviewed by the Stakeholder Group to ensure that they were relevant to policy needs. 1 U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010. 7th Edition, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, December 2010. Dietary Patterns 2 The systematic review questions included in this project were organized based on (1) dietary pattern methodology and (2) health outcomes: Dietary pattern methodology: Dietary patterns can be assessed in a number of ways, including numerical indices designed to gauge adherence to a particular pattern (e.g., Healthy Eating Index [HEI]) or data- driven approaches that use mathematics to empirically derive food intake patterns inherent among the study population (e.g., factor or cluster analysis) (appendix A) . Dietary patterns can also be tested in trials or observed in observational studies. Because each methodology provides information about dietary patterns from a different perspective, t he systematic review questions included in this project were organized based on dietary pattern assessment : (1) index analysis, ( 2) factor/cluster analysis, ( 3) reduced rank regression, and (4) other methods. Health o utcomes: The TEC identified three top priority outcomes for consideration: ( 1) body weight and obesity, (2) cardiovascular disease, and ( 3) type 2 diabetes. For each outcome, specific intermediate and clinical outcomes were defined (appendix B). A fourth outcome, c ancer, was also identified but was not completed. In total, 12 systematic review questions were completed in this project: Body Weight or Risk of Obesity 1. What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and body weight or risk of obesity? A priori index 2. Are prevailing patterns of diet behavior in a population related to body weight or risk of obesity? Factor analysis, principal component analysis; cluster analysis 3. What combinations of food intake explain the most variation in a risk of obesity? Reduced rank regression; discriminant analysis 4. What is the relationship between adherence to a specific dietary pattern and body weight or risk of obesity? Included studies that did not use the methodologies captured in the other systematic review questions Risk of Cardiovascular Disease 5. What is the r elationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and risk of cardiovascular disease? A priori index 6. Are prevailing patterns of diet behavior in a population related to risk of cardiovascular disease? Factor analysis, principal component analysis; cluster analysis 7. What combinations of food intake explain the most variation in a risk of cardiovascular disease? Reduced rank regression; discriminant analysis 8. What is the relation ship between adherence to a specific dietary pattern and risk of cardiovascular disease? Included studies that did not use the methodologies captured in the other systematic review questions Risk of Type 2 Diabetes 9. What is the relationship between adheren ce to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and risk of type 2 diabetes? A priori index 10. Are prevailing patterns of diet behavior in a population related t o risk of type 2 diabetes? Factor analys is, principal component analysis; cluster analysis 11. What combinations of food intake explain the most variation in a risk of type 2 diabetes? Reduced rank regression; discriminant analysis 12. What is the relationship between adherence to a specific dietary pattern and risk of type 2 diabetes? Included studies that did not use the methodologies captured in the other systematic review questions Dietary Patterns 3 Literature Selection A broad range of studies assessing dietary patterns were considered in order to answer the systematic review questions. PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts) , and Cochrane databases were searched for o riginal research articles published in English in peer -reviewed journals. Studies published since January 1980 with subjects who were healthy or at elevated chronic disease risk from countries with high or very high scores on the H uman Development Index,2 a measure of social and economic development, were considered. Study designs included in the review were randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials , including crossover studies, and prospective cohort studies. Cross- sectional studies, before and after studies, case -control studies , and reviews were excluded. Reviews were hand -searched for relevant primary research studies. Trials were required to have 30 subj ects per arm and a follow -up of 80 percent . Studies that examined low -calorie diets and other treatment diets were excluded. Finally, studies were required to include a description of the foods and beverages eaten by study participants . The searches resulted in a total of 23,403 citations . Of these, 2,921 a rticles underwent dual abstract review , and a total of 176 articles met all of the criteria and were included in the review s. Description of the Evidence The evidence considered in this systematic review project was diverse . The number of articles included in each review varied, with 5 reviews including less than 10 art icles, 6 reviews including 11 to 22 articles, and 1 review including 55 articles. Studies were conducted around the world, including the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia , and ranged in sample size from 49 to ov er 380,000 . Most studies were conducted in adults, with few studies available that examined dietary patterns in children or adolescents. T he preponderance of evidence was from large prospective cohort studies; although some well -controlled randomized contr olled trials were also included . The prospective cohort studies generally examined the relationship between dietary patterns and clinical health outcomes, while the trials often considered intermediate outcomes. Dietary intake was most often assessed with food frequency questionnaires , and in many studies, dietary intake was only assessed at baseline. Most articles were rated positive -quality, with fewer articles of neutral -quality . No negative -quality articles were included in the reviews. Conclusion Statements Following a qualitative review of the evidence, conclusions were drawn and the strength of the body of evidence supporting the conclusion statement was graded. More robust evidence was available for the questions examining the relationship betwe en dietary patterns and risk of cardiovascular disease. Moderate evidence supported conclusions related to dietary patterns and body weight or risk of obesity, while limited evidence was available related to dietary patterns and risk of type 2 diabetes. Across the methodologies, the strongest, most consistent evidence was from positive -quality cohort studies using an a priori index or score and randomized controlled tri als testing specific patterns. For all three of the questions that considered studies using factor or cluster analyses, l imited conclusions were drawn primarily due to the variability in the dietary patterns identified in these studies , which made comparisons challenging. Similarly, the disparate nature of the studies that used reduced rank regression to assess dietary patterns made it difficult to compare results, and no conclusions could be drawn related to the relationship between dietary patterns and health outcomes using reduced rank regression. Overall, not one specific dietary patter n was found to be more favorably associated with health outcomes. Rather, several dietary patterns were shown to be beneficial in reducing the risk of cardiovascular dise ase, obesity, and/or type 2 diabetes. The patterns that were most consistently associated with positive health outcomes were Mediterranean -style , Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Dietary Guidelines -related patterns . Over the course of the review , the Technical Expert Collaborative and the Systematic Review Management Team 2 United Nations Development Programme. 2011 Human Development Reports. Available at http://hdr.undp.org/en . Dietary Patterns 4 noted that there were not univers al definitions for these and other dietary pattern labels or for terms that were often found in this literature, including plant -based, nutrient -dense, or minimally processed . For example, a Mediterranean diet may v ary somewhat from study to study, and a vegetarian pattern is typically defined based on what is excluded from the diet, rather than what is consumed. As such, the review conclusion statements were stated in terms of the food components observed consistent ly across the dietary patterns, rather than focusing on the label of the pattern . Additionally, the team found that the meaning of terms , such as low, moderate, and high, used to describe levels of food group, component , or nutrient intakes varied somewhat across studies. For example, low might mean lower than median intake, lower than recommended intake levels, or lower than the typical American or population intake. Depending on the body of included literature for each systematic review question, usage of these terms in this report's conclusion statements and key findings may represent a composite of these meanings. Dietary Patterns and Risk of Cardio vascular Disease Dietary patterns associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease were characterized by regular consumption of fruits, vegeta bles, whole grains, low-fat dairy , and fish and were low in red and processed meat and sugar - sweetened foods and drinks . Regular consumption of nuts and legumes and m oderate consumption of alcohol were also shown to be beneficial in most studies. Additionally, research that included specific nutrients in their description of dietary patterns indicated that patterns that were low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium and rich in fiber and potassium may be beneficial for reducing cardiovascular d isease risk . Conclusion Statements: Dietary Patterns and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Strong or Moderate Evidence: There is strong and consistent evidence that in healthy adults increased adherence to dietary patterns scoring high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated oils, low -fat dairy, poultry , and fish; low in red and processed meat, high -fat dairy, and sugar -sweetened foods and drinks ; and moderate in alcohol is associated with decreased risk of fatal and non -fatal cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and stroke. (Grade : I - Strong) (Index Analysis) There is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of a DASH diet results in reduced blood pressure in adults with above optimal blood pressure, up to and including stage 1 hypertension. A dietary pattern consistent with the DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, low -fat dairy, fish, whole grains, fiber, potassium , and other minerals at recommended levels, and low in red and processed meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , saturated fat, cholesterol, an d sodium. There is limited evidence that adherence to vegetarian diets is associated with decreased death from ischemic heart disease, with the association being stronger in men than in women. (Grade: I - Strong - DASH and Blood Pressure; Grade: III - Limi ted - Vegetarian and Ischemic Heart Disease) (Other Methods) Limited or Insufficient Evidence: Limited evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that dietary patterns, assessed using cluster or factor analysis, characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low -fat dairy products are associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease in adults. Evidence of a relationship between dietary patterns characterized by red and processed meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , and fried foods and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease is limited and less consistent. (Grade: III - Limited) (Cluster or Factor Analysis) Insufficient evidence, due to a small number of studies, was available to examine the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and risk of cardiovascular disease. The disparate nature of the methods used made it difficult to compare results, and therefore, no conclusions were drawn. (Grade: IV - Not Assignable) (Reduced Rank Regression) Dietary Patterns 5 Conclusion Statements: Dietary Patterns and Body Weight or Risk of Obesity Moderate Evidence: There is moderate evidence that in adults increased adherence to dietary patt erns scoring high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, unsaturated oils, and fish; low in total meat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar - sweetened foods and drinks and sodium; and moderate in dairy products and alcohol is associated with more favorable outcomes related to body weight or risk of obesity, with some reports of variation based on gender, race, or body weight status. (Grade: II - Moderate) (Index Analysi s) There is moderate evidence that adherence to a dietary pattern that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and whole grains is associated with modest benefits in preventing weight gain or promoting weight loss in adults. ( Grade: II - Moderate) (Other Methods) Limited or Insufficient Evidence: Limited and inconsistent evidence from epidemiological studies examining dietary patterns derived using factor or cluster analysis in adults found that consumption of a dietary pattern characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains , and reduced -fat dairy products tends to be associated with more favorable body weight status over time than consumption of a dietary pattern characterized by red meat, processed meats, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , and refined gra ins. (Grade: III - Limited ) (Factor or Cluster Analysis) There are a number of methodological differences among the studies examining the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and body weight status. The disparate nat ure of these studies made it difficult to compare results, and therefore, no conclusions were drawn. (Grade: IV - Not Assignable) (Reduced Rank Regression) Dietary Patterns and Body Weight or Risk of Obesity More favorable outcomes related to body weight or risk of obesity were observed when there was increased adherence to a diet that emphasized fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Some studies also reported more favorable body weight status over time with regular intake of fish and legumes, moderate intake of dairy products (particularly low-fat dairy) and alcohol, and low intake of meat (including red and processed meat), sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , refined grains, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. Dietary Patterns 6 Dietary Patterns and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes The bodies of evidence examining the relationship between dietary patterns and risk of type 2 diabetes were limited or insufficient, but they generally supported consumption of a dietary pattern rich in fruits and vegetables and low in high-fat dairy and meats. Limitations and Research Recommendations The systematic reviews highlighted overarching limitations in the research on dietary patterns . The following limitations and research recommendations were identified: Many studies only assessed dietary intake once at baseline. Dietary patterns are likely to change over time due to a myriad of factors, including trends in the food supply , population and individual -level changes in food choices , and individual circumstances and physical needs . Future studies that examine diet ary patterns over time in relation to the life course would be beneficial to understand the relationship between dietary patterns , critical periods of exposure, and health. There was variability in how s tudies grouped foods and assessed the types and amounts of foods consumed; therefore, it was difficult to compare food and beverage intakes across studies . Additional research is needed to better quantitate the components of dietary patterns. A number of studies, particularly studies examining vegetarian diets, were excluded from the reviews because they did not provide sufficient description of the dietary pattern consumed. Complete description of the foods and beverages consumed is essential for comparing studies and understanding the characteristics of the dietary patterns. Conclusion Statements: Dietary Patterns and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Limited or Insufficient Evidence: There is limited evidence that adherence to a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals/whole grains, nuts, fish, and un saturated oils and low in meat and high -fat dairy, assessed using an index or score, is associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. (Grade: III - Limited) (Index Analysis) Limited and inconsistent evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that in adults, dietary patterns derived using factor or cluster analysis, characterized by vegetables, fruits, and low -fat dairy products tend to have an association with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and those patterns characterized by red meat and sugar - sweetened foods and drinks , French fries, refined grains , and high -fat dairy products tended to show an increased association for risk of type 2 diabetes. Among studies , there was substantial variation in food group components and not all studies with similar patterns showed significant association . (Grade: III - Limited) (Factor or Cluster Analysis) There is insufficient evidence on a relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean -style or vegetarian diet pattern and incidence of type 2 diabetes. There is limited, inconsistent evidence that adherence to a Mediterranean -style, DASH or modified DASH, or Nordic dietary pattern results in improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. (Grade IV - Not Assignable - Incidence of type 2 diabetes; Grade: III - Limited - Glucose tolerance and insulin resistance) (Other Methods) There is insufficient evidence, due to a small number of studies, to examine the relationship betw een dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and risk of type 2 diabetes. The differences in the methods used and populations studied made it difficult to compare results, and therefore no conclusions were drawn. (Grade: IV - Not Assignable) (Reduced Rank Regression) Dietary Patterns 7 Many of the studies were conducted with predominantly Caucasian adults . Additional research should be conducted to examine if and how race/ ethnicity , age, and sex might i nfluence the relationship between dietary patterns and health outcomes. Additionally, m ore research is recommended to: Advance dietary pattern methodologies to better elucidate the indispensible components, or the \"drivers ,\" of dietary patterns that are instrumental in promoting health and preventing disease. Investigate other aspects of dietary patterns, including where and when foods and beverages are consumed . Test the effectiveness of dietary patterns identified in observational studies in randomized controlled trials. Examine the effects of different methods by which components are chosen, grouped, and scored and the effect those different methods have on the resulting rel ationships with health outcomes , regarding a priori scores. Evaluate and standardize methods used to assess, organize, aggregate, and adjust food variables to facilitate interpretation o f findings across studies, regarding a posteriori approaches. Dietary Patterns 8 Chapter 2. Introduction Consuming a healthy diet can help individuals achieve and maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases, and promote good health. Research in the field of nutrition often focuses on single nutrients, foods, and/or food groups. C onsidering individual nutrients and foods in the development of guidance on the types and amounts of foods, beverages, and nutrients to consume is challenging for a number of reasons:3 It is difficult to attribute health effects to a single dietary compon ent; Dietary components may interact with each other; and When manipulating the diet, there may be substitution effects (e.g., high intake of one dietary component is accompanied by changes in o ther aspects of the diet) . By studying dietary patterns, these potential cumulative and interactive effects of individual components of the diet can be accounted for. S tudying dietary patterns is a complementary strategy to examining individual foods and nutrients or food components . Additionally, b ecause people consume foods, beverages , and nutrients , in combination and not just individual ly, the study of dietary patterns has real -world application . As methods used to assess dietary patterns have been advancing, researchers have been able to examine the relationship between complex dietary patterns and health. T he 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) acknowledged that the state of the evidence and the methodologic rigor of the studies examining dietary patterns had advanced ; thus, research on this topic was summarized in the 2010 DGAC Report 4 in a chapter titled The Total Diet: Combining Nutrients, Consuming Food , which was subsequently used as the foundation for a chapter in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans5 titled Building Healthy Eating Patterns . Rationale The inclusion of die tary patterns in the DGAC 2010 R eport and the subsequent 2010 Dietary Guidelines was supported within and outside of the government . Following the 2010 Dietary Guidelines release, the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL) conducted intervi ews with various Federal stakeholders, and dietary patterns was identified as a topic that should be monitored. Based on this feedback, the NEL initiated this systematic review project to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and health outcomes. Systematic reviews are conducted to aid compliance with the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 20016 or Data Quality Act, which mandates Federal agencies ensure the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of the information used to form federal guidance. Systematic reviews of dietary patterns research may help USDA agencies in the development and support of nutrition -related policies and programs . Framing the Project The NEL Systematic Review Management Team collaborated with a Technical Expert Collaborativ e (TEC) and a group of Federal S takeholders t o complete the review. The TEC include d seven national nutrition experts who were convened to review, evaluate, and synthesize research on dietary patterns , and a Federal S takeholder group was identi fied to ensure that the review would be valuable for informing future diet -related policies and programs. 3 Schulze MB, Hoffmann K.

Dietary Patterns 9 For the purpose of this systematic review project, dietary patterns is defined as: The quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually con sumed. To inform the design and objectives of the project, USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion supported a workshop titled, \"Dietary Patterns Re search Methods: Strengths and Limitations of Various Approaches to Inform a Systematic Review.\" The workshop was held on September 1, 2011 in Alexandria, VA. The Dietary Patterns Systematic Review Management Team, Technical Expert Collaborative, and several Stakeholders attended the workshop along with invited speakers identified by the Technical Expert Collaborative. Expert presentations included the following: Using factor and cluster analysis to derive dietary patterns o P.K.

The Dietary Patterns Systematic Review Management Team and Technical Expert Collaborative used the discussion from this workshop to frame the approach and questions for this project. Objectives The purpose of the Dietary Patt erns Systematic Review project wa s to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and outcomes of public health concern. The initial goal of this project is to c ontinue the work initiated by the 20 10 DGAC to assess the association of several dietary patterns with blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and tota l mortality. Additional objectives were identified and prioritized by the TEC with input from the Systematic Review Management Team a nd key stakeholders. The systematic review questions included in this project were organized based on (1) dietary pattern methodology and (2) health outcomes: Dietary pattern methodology: Dietary patterns can be assessed in a number of ways, including indices that assess adherence to a particular pattern (e.g., Healthy Eating Index [HEI]) or data- driven approaches that use mathematics to empirically derive food intake patterns (e.g. , factor or cluster analysis) (appendix A). Dietary patterns can also be tested in trials or observed in observational studies. Because each methodology provides information about dietary patterns from a different perspective, the systematic review questions included in this project were organized based on dietary pattern asse ssment : (1) index analysis, (2) factor/cluster analysis, ( 3) reduced rank regression, and ( 4) other methods. Health o utcomes: The TEC identified three top priority outcomes for consideration: ( 1) body weight and obesity, (2) cardiovascular disease, and ( 3) type 2 diabetes. For each outcome, specific intermediate and Dietary Patterns 10 clinical outcomes were defined (appendix B). A fourth outcome, cancer, was also identified but was not completed due to resource constraints. In total, 12 systematic review questions were completed in this project : Body Weight or Risk of Obesity 1. What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and body weight or risk of obesity? A priori index 2. Are prevailing patterns of diet behavior in a population related to body weight or risk of obesity? Factor analysis, principal component analysis; cluster analysis 3. What combinations of food intake explain the most variation in a risk of obesity? Reduced rank regression; discriminant analysis 4. What is the relationship between adherence to a specific dietary pattern and body weight or risk of obesity? Included studies that did not use the methodologies captured in the other systematic review questions Risk of Cardiovascular Disease 5. What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and risk of cardiovascular disease? A priori index 6.

What combinations of food intake explain the most variation in a risk of cardiovascular disease? Reduced rank regression; discr iminant analysis 8. What is the relationship between adherence to a specific dietary pattern and risk of cardiovascular disease? Included studies that did not use the methodologies captured in the other systematic review questions Risk of Type 2 Diabetes 9. Wha t is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and risk of type 2 diabetes? A priori index 10. Are prevailing patterns of diet behavior in a population related to r isk of type 2 diabetes? Factor analysis, principal component analysis; cluster analysis 11.

What is the relationship between adherence to a specific dietary pattern and risk of type 2 diabetes? Included studies that did not use the methodologies captured in the other systematic review questions The topic of dietary patterns is a growing area of research relevant to nutrition policy and programs. The results of this project can b e used to inform F ederal guidance related to foods and beverages, including the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . It can also help identify areas where more research is needed. Dietary Patterns 11 Chapter 3. Methods The Nutrition Evidence Library ( NEL ) was launched in July 2008 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion . The NEL uses a rigorous, transparent, and reproducible methodology to conduct systematic reviews on food- and nutrition -related topics to support Federal nutrition policies and programs. The following section describes t he systematic review methodology used to conduct a series of systematic reviews on dietary patterns and health. Dietary Patterns Systematic Review Project : Roles and Responsibilities When conducting systematic reviews, NEL staff are assigned to a NEL Project Sy stematic Review Management Team and work with a Technical Expert Collaborate (TEC) , a Stakeholder Group, Abstractors, and Peer Reviewers. The roles and responsibilities of each of these groups and individuals are outlined below. NEL Systematic Review Management Team This NEL systematic review project wa s planned, organized, and guided by a NEL Systematic Review Management Team composed of Federal nutritionists trained in systematic review methodology . This team wa s led by the Director of the Evidence Analysis Library Division (EALD) and include d a Project Manager, Lead Analysts, Technical Advisors, and a Research L ibrarian . The Project Manager was responsible for leading, planning, organizing, and facil itating the work necessary for execution of the systematic review project . The Lead Analysts led the review of the individual research questions , and the NEL Research Librarian develop ed and implemented the search strategy for the scientific articles . The Technical Advisors provided advice to help guide the project and served as reviewers of the materials prepared by the Lead Analysts. Specific responsibilities of the NEL Systematic Review Management Team included the following: Facilitated the initial planning and led development of the systematic review project protocol . Direct ed the execution and quality control of the NEL systematic review project based on input from the TEC and Stakeholders in accordance with the principles and procedur es outlined in the NEL systematic review methodology manual. Developed and disseminated products of the review , including website content, this systematic review report, and peer -reviewed publications . The NEL Systematic Review Management Team met regularly throughout the systematic review project from conceptualization of the project through completion of the final products. They coordinate d regular meetings with the TEC and Stakeholder Group s through conference call and webinar . They also serve d as the conduit between the TEC and the Stakeholder Group, Abstractors, and Peer Reviewers. Technical Expert Collaborative The Technical Expert Collaborative (TEC) consisted of seven national nutrition experts . A list of TEC members and their affiliations is found in the Acknowledgements section (on page 5 ). TEC members a ssisted the NEL Systematic Review Management Team by reviewing and providing expert feedback to refine systematic review materials. Their expert ise was needed to address spec ific issues related to the topic of dietary patterns and to guide synthesi s of the body of evidence to answer the systematic review questions . TEC members guide d the systematic review process in the following ways: Review ed and refine d materials drafted by the NEL Systematic Review Management Team, including: o Analytic al framework and systematic review questions o Literature search strategy , including guidance on potential searc h terms and databases o Criteria used to select articles included in the review o Lists of included and excluded articles Dietary Patterns 12 o Data extraction plan , including guidance on relevant information that should be extracted from each article and summarized in evidence paragraphs and tables o A description of the body of evidence, including evidence worksheets with quality rating s o A synthesis of the body of evidence, including identification of themes apparent in the body of evidence o Conclusion statements and grades assigned based upon the body of evidence Additionally, the TEC: o Provide d input on limitations and research recommendations o Served as co -authors of manuscript(s) submitted for peer -review publication . NEL Project Stakeholder Group Members of the Stakeholder Group included Federal employees who represent end-users of the review and possess ed varying perspectives and expertise related to dietary patterns . The Stakeholder Group was instrumental in the initiation of the project to ensure that the products from the reviews would be valuable for informing polic ies and programs. Specifically, the Stakeholder Group: Assist ed in refining and prioritizing systematic review questions Provide d input on suggested inclusion and exclusion criteria . NEL Abstractors NEL Abstractors are National Service Volunteers from across the United States with advanced degrees in nutrition or a related field. They received training to review individual research articles included in the systematic reviews and rate the methodological r igor (quality) of each study. They extract ed evidence from the research articles and posted this information to data fields in evidence worksheet templates in the NEL online portal. The methodological rigor of each i ncluded study wa s assessed using the Research Desig n and Implementation Checklist. Worksheets prepared by the Abstractors were reviewed by the NEL Systematic Review Management Team and provide d a templated presentation of each article to assist the TEC in their review of the evidence. Peer Revi ewers Peer reviewers were i ndividuals from USDA who review ed and provide d comment on the systematic review products. The peer reviewer s provide d written input after th is draft report was produced. Peer review was sought to ensure that thi s report provides a transparent and comprehensive description of the review. T he NEL Systematic Review Management Team, particularly the Project Manager , coordinate d the peer -review and developed response s to comments. Dietary Patterns 13 Dietary Patterns Systematic Review s: Methodology Research Protocol The NEL uses a rigorous, transparent, and reproducible methodology that was informed by the Agency for Healthcare Research Quality (AHRQ), the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) (formerly the American Dietetic Association ), and the US Cochrane Collaboration process . The NEL utilizes a six-step systematic review process to conduct systematic reviews. The steps include: 1. Systematic review question development 2. Literature search, screening, and selection 3. Data extract ion and quality assessment 4. Describing the evidence and evidence synthesis 5. Developing conclusion statements and grading the evidence 6. Identifying research recommendations. Each step of these NEL processes and how it was applied to the Dietary Patterns System atic Review Project is described below. Develop Systematic Review Questions and Analytical Frameworks The first step of the evidence analysis process was the development of systematic review questions. This step of the process was informed by the Dietary Patterns Workshop, which was held by the NEL to inform the initial aspects of the review. During the Workshop, invited experts spoke on various methodologies used to assess dietary patterns, and then a facilitated discussion occurred to help identify the q uestions of interest that might benefit from a systematic review. Following the Workshop, the TEC finalized and prioritized their questions of interest, and the questions were presented by the NEL to the Stakeholder Group to ensure that the questions addressed policy and program needs. Once key topic areas were identified, t he PICO ( Population, Intervention, Comparator, and O utcomes) method was used in order to focus each of the systematic review questions. In addition, an analytical framework was created to provide a visual map of key variables, such as the population , interventions , comparators , outcomes, and potential confounders, to be addressed within each review (appendix A ). For the purposes of this review \"dietary patterns \" was defined as \"the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed .\" For each systematic review question developed, the following PICO components w ere used: Population: Children, adolescents, and adults aged 2 years and older Intervention/Exposure: A dietary pattern Comparator: Low adherence to a particular dietary pattern (control) or a different dietary pattern (comparison) Outcomes: Health outcomes The systematic review questions included in this project were organized based on (1) dietary pattern methodology and (2) health outcomes . Create and Implement Literature Search and Sort Plans After the systematic review questions were de veloped, the NEL Project Management Team developed the literature search and sort plan used to identify scientific articles to answer each systematic review question. The search and sort plan includes the development of inclusion and exclusion criteria, id entification of databases and search terms used to identify relevant articles, implementation of the search strategy, and selection of studies to include in each systematic review. The TEC reviewed and provided feedback on inclusion and exclusion criteria, the literature search strategy, and the list of articles included and excluded for each review. Dietary Patterns 14 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria for the dietary patterns systematic reviews included the following : Human subjects Subject population s from countries with high or very high human development, according to the Human Development Index7 Children, adolescents, and adults aged 2 years and older Subjects who were healthy or at elevated chronic disease risk Randomized or non randomized controlled trial with at least 30 subjects per study arm and a f ollow -up rate of at leas t 80 percent , or a prospective cohort study A description of the dietary pattern(s) consumed by subjects In addition, a rticles were included if they were published in English in a peer -reviewed journal between January 1980 and August 2013 (see a ppendices F -H for the date of the last search update for each ques tion). If an author is included on more than one primary research article that is similar in content, the pap er with the most pertinent data/endpoints was included. If data/endpoints from both papers are appropriate, it was made clear that results are from the same intervention. Exclusion criteria for the dietary patterns systematic reviews include d: Animal s and in vitro models Subject population s from countries with medium or low human development, according to the Human Development Index Children under the age of 2 years Subjects who were hospitalized, diagnosed with disease, and/or receiving medical treatm ent Low-calorie intervention ( defined as <1,600 kcal/day for kcal/day for men) Systematic review , meta -analysi s, narrative review , before and after, cross -sectional, or case- control designs Articles were excluded if they were not published in English , or were published before January 19 80. Articles, abstracts, and presentations not published in peer -reviewed journals (e.g. , websites, magazine articles, Federal reports) were also excluded. Finally, i f an author was included on more than one review article or primary research article that is similar in content, the paper with the most pertinent data/endpoints was included, and others were excluded. Search Strategy The search strategy was developed by the NEL Resea rch Librarian and reviewed by the Lead Analyst and TEC members . PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, Food Science and Technology Abstracts ), and Cochrane databases were searched using a wide variety of search terms and key words, including subject headings such as MeSH and thesauri terms . The search strategies included specific terms for dietary patterns (e.g., vegetarian, Mediterranean), dietary pattern methodologies (e.g., facto r analysis) , and health outcomes of interest. The specific strategy f or each search is described in appendices F -H. The first outcome considered in this project was body weight/obesity . As shown in a ppendix F, t hree searches were conducted for articles examining the relationship between dietary pattern s and body weight using (1) index analysis, (2) factor/cluster analysis or reduced rank regression, and (3) other methods. Appendices G and H provide the search strategies to identify articles examining th e relationship between dietary patterns and cardiovascular disease and 7 United Nations Development Programme. 2011 Human Development Reports. Available at http://hdr.undp.org/en . Dietary Patterns 15 type 2 diabetes, respectively. In each case, one search was conducted and relevant articles were divided based on dietary pattern methodology. When needed, supplementary and update sear ches were conducted. Study Selection The NEL librarian conducted all database searches and performed initial title sorts to exclude articles that clearly did not address the question. A second member of the Systematic Review Management Team reviewed the articles excluded during the title sort and recommended articles that should be moved forward for further review. Two members of the NEL staff independently sorted abstracts and full text articles based upon approved criteria and developed a list of in cluded and excluded articles (citing rationale for exclusion). The lists of included and excluded articles were compared, and the two reviewers reached consensus on articles for which there was discrepancy. When consensus could not be reached, a third memb er of the Systematic Review Management Team was asked to review the article. When needed, articles in question were brought to the full Systematic Review Management Team and/or the TEC for final inclusion or exclusion. Additionally, reference lists from re view and primary articles were hand searched. TEC members reviewed and provided feedback on the sort lists. If TEC members identified relevant articles that were not on the sort list, or if search results were too expansive or too limited, the Systematic R eview Management Team refined the search strategy and the search was rerun. NEL staff continued to monitor the literature for new articles through August 2013. Develop Evidence Portfolios for E ach Systematic Review Question Relevant information fr om all included articles in each systematic review was assembled in to evidence portfolios. For each study in a systematic review , the evidence portfolio includes an evidence worksheet with a study quality rating that reflects the assessment of methodological rigor of the study , as well as a data extraction grid and in some cases an evidence paragraph that summarizes the study methodology and results as it relates to the systematic review question being addressed. The components of the evidence portfolio are described in more detail below. Each article included in a review was assigned to a NEL Abstractor to analyze and extract key data into an evidence worksheet template. The quality , or methodological rigor, of each article was assessed using the Research Design and Implementation (RDI) Checklist, developed by the A cademy of Nutrition and Dietetics . The RDI checklist is based on criteria outlined in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report on Systems to Rate the Strength of Scientific Evidence (West et al., 20028). The RDI checklist for primary research articles include s 10 scientific validity questions ( ADA, 2009)9 (appendix C ). Based on responses to the checklist, each article wa s assigned a quality rating, positive , neutral, or negative that reflects the methodological rigor with which the research was designed and executed . NEL staff reviewed the accuracy and quality of each evidence worksheet and RDI checklist . The NEL staff worked wi th the TEC to define the content of data extraction grid s and evidence paragraphs for each systematic review question . Using the evidence worksheets, RDI checklists, and full text articles, NEL staff drafted evidence paragraphs and grid entries to summarize the evidence in a uniform way for study -to-study evaluation and comparison. The evidence paragraphs briefly summarized each included study and reported relevant data including: authors, publication year, rating; population, location, sample s ize and subject age; purpose of the study; description of study design and groups; methods used to assess dietary intake ; dietary pattern methodology; brief description of the dietary patterns examined in the study; outcomes considered; and results related to the outcomes of interest in this review project. Use of evidence paragraphs was discontinued during the project and paragraph elements were incorporated into the description of the evidence. The data extraction grid provided information parallel to the evidence paragraphs , as well as additional information about study subjects (sex , race/ ethnicity , and socioeconomic 8 West S, King V, Carey TS, Lohr KN, McKoy N, Sutton SF, Lux L.

Dietary Patterns 16 status) and key confounders and limitations of each in cluded study . The Lead Analyst created a Description of the Evidence for each question that enumerated the number, type, quality, and descriptive characteristics of the included studies. Synthesize the Body of Evidence TEC members were asked to review the portfolio of evidence for each question and independently answer a series of questions to identify key trends in the body of evidence (appendix D). The Key Trends questionnaire was designed to identify patterns of agreement and disagreement among the studies as well as identify rationale for differences observed in the body of evidence. The Key Trends document also asked questions related to the generalizability and public healt h impact of the findings observed across the studies. The NEL Systematic Review Management Team used the responses from the TEC members on the Key Trends questionnaire to develop evidence summary overviews that identified the key findings or trends, pote ntial rationale for variations observed, and strengths and limi tations of the body of evidence . TEC members reviewed the evidence synthesis and suggested refinement, as needed . Develop and Grade the Conclusion Statement The Key Trends questionnaire also asked the TEC members to independently identify themes they thought should be included in the conclusion statement. The NEL Systematic Review Management Team drafted a conclusion statement to answer the systematic review question based on their responses. Each conclusion statement was reviewed by the TEC and refined, as needed. Conclusion statements focused on areas of general agreement among the studies and when evidence addressed only one sex , age group, ethnicity, or level of health risk, this was reflected in the conclusion statement. Other findings from the body of evidence that helped to frame the conclusion statement or that were important to the review, but were not included in the concl usion statement, were summarized as Key Findings. The NEL Systematic Review Management Team then facilitated an evaluat ion by the TEC members of the strength of the body of evidence supporting each conclusion using a pre- established set of criteria. Th ese criteria were adapted and validated by the American Dietetic Association (now the Academ y of Nutrition and Dietetics) based upon the original work by Greer and colleagues . 10 Grading criteria included: quality , quantity, consistency, generalizability, and public health impact. The following grades were used to describe the strength of the evidence supporting their conclusion statements: I - Strong, II - Moderate, III - Limited, and I V - Grade Not Assignable. Appendix E provides more detail on the grading cr iteria. Define Research Recommendations The Key Trends questionnaire also asked the TEC members to independently identify research recommendations related to the question or topic area. The NEL Systematic Review Management Team compiled these recommendations, which were reviewed by the TEC members and refined, as needed. 10 Greer N, Mosser G, Logan G, Halaas GW.

The Relationship Between Dietary Patterns and Body Weight Section I: Index Analysis By Mary M. McGrane , Joan Lyon, and Eve Essery Stoody What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and measures of body weight or obesity? TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review project was to identify dietary patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Dietary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks , and nutrients in diets, and the frequency with which they are hab itually consumed. Researchers have used scores (or indices) to measure adherence to healthy dietary patterns, such as a Mediterranean style diet, or adherence to dietary guidelines. The scores are then used to examine associations between a given dietary p attern and health outcomes. Because of the increased prevalence of overweight and obesity in the U nited States , with associated co -morbidities, it is important to determine which dietary patterns may be associated with prevention or decreases in obesity, a nd how this information can be translated to nutrition policy recommendations. The objective of this systematic review question was to determine the association between adherence to a specific dietary pattern, assessed using an index or score, and measures of body weight or obesity. Conclusion Statement There is moderate evidence that, in adults, increased adherence to dietary patterns scoring high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, unsaturated oils, and fish; low in total meat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar -sweetened foods and beverages , and sodium; and moderate in dairy products and alcohol is associated with more favorable outcomes related to body weight or risk of obesity, with some reports of variation based on gender, race , or body wei ght status. (Grade: II Moderate) Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts) and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns (using an a priori index or score) and risk of obesity. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the review: randomized controlled trials, non -randomized controlled trials, or prospective c ohort studies; subjects aged 2 to 18 years; subjects who were healthy or at elevated chronic disease risk; subjects from countries with high or very high human development (2011 Human Development Index); and published in English in peer -reviewed journals. The date range was unlimited. Diet exposure was assessed by adherence to a hypothesis -based dietary pattern, defined using a numerical scoring system. A group of technical experts were involved in a qualitative synthesis of the bo dy of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the strength of the evidence (grade) using pre -established criteria including evaluation of the quality, quantity, consistency, magnitude o f effect , and generalizability of available evidence. Dietary Patterns 18 Findings Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review and the body of evidence consisted primarily of large prospective cohort studies. Two major categories of diet exposure were identified: Mediterranean style and dietary guidelines -related dietary patterns. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet score or a dietary guidelines -related score was associated with decreased risk of obesity, with some reported variation based on gender or body weight status. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet score or a dietary guidelines -related score was associated with decreased body weight, BMI, waist circumference, or percent body fat, with some variation based on gender and race. Mediterranean or dietary guidelines -related dietary pattern s share many beneficial characteristics and generally reflect a plant -based, minimally processed, nutrient -dense dietary pattern. Consistent components across the scores were beneficial foods including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and sources of unsaturated fats (particularly fish); foods that were beneficial in moderation including dairy products and alcohol, and foods and nutrients presumed to be detrimental including total meat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar -sweetened foods and beverages , and sodium. Discussion The scores that were associated with decreased risk of obesity were the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), the relative Mediterranean Diet Score (rMED), the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) -1995 and a customized H EI-2005, the Diet Quality Index- International (DQI -I), the Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index (DGAI), and the French Programme National Nutrition Sant\u00e9 Guideline Score (PNNS -GS). Taken together, the positive components of scores that were associated with decreased risk of obesity were fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and fish. Alcohol was commonly included as a positive component when consumed in moderation. Meat and dair y, with some variations, were negative components in Mediterranean scores or recommended within specific ranges for dietary guidelines indices. The dietary guidelines indices also included saturated fat and cholesterol, or added non - vegetable fats, as negative components above a specified level of intake. Sugar -sweetened food and drink components were included and scored negatively in most of the dietary guidelines indices. Overall, there were a large variety of dietary pattern scores used that were difficu lt to compare because foods were aligned, described, or scored in dissimilar ways. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Is adherence to dietary guidelines or specific dietary patterns, assessed by a predetermined score, related to the likelihood of becoming overweig ht or obese? The analysis of dietary patterns takes into account overall diet intake, including all foods and beverages that an individual consumes over a specified period of time. Dietary patterns that have been identified as healthy or protective agains t disease have been identified, such as a Mediterranean style diet. Additionally, dietary guidelines recommend a specific dietary pattern that is healthy. Many researchers examine how well individuals follow a specific dietary pattern or set of dietary gui delines by creating a score that measures high, medium, and low adherence to the specified diet. These scores have been used to examine the relationship between specific dietary patterns and health outcomes. The objective of this question was to determine the relationship between adherence to a dietary pattern, assessed using a score, and measures of body weight or obesity. Conclusion There is moderate evidence that, in adults, increased adherence to dietary patterns scoring high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, unsaturated oils, and fish; low in total meat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , and sodium; and moderate in dairy products and alcohol is associated with more favorable outcomes related to body weight or risk of obesity, with some reports of variation based on gender, race, or body weight status. Dietary Patterns 19 What the research says In adults, individuals who had a high Mediterranean diet or dietary guidelines score were at lower risk of becoming obese than those who had a low score. A few studies reported some differences in men compared to women or differences in normal weight compared to overweight individuals. Mediterranean or dietary guidelines -related patterns share many foods and beverages, and generally reflect a plant -based, minimally processed diet that is high in nutrients. Common foods, beverages, and nutrients were: (1) beneficial foods including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and sources of unsaturated fats (particularly fish); ( 2) foods that were beneficial in moderation including dairy products and alcohol; and ( 3) foods and nutrients presumed to be harm ful including total meat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , and sodium. EVIDENCE PORTFOLIO Conclusion Statement There is moderate evide nce that, in adults, increased adherence to dietary patterns scoring high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, unsaturated oils, and fish; low in total meat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , and sodium; and moderate in dairy products and alcohol is associated with more favorable outcomes related to bod y weight or risk of obesity, with some reports of variation based on gender, race , or body weight status. Grade II - Moderate Key Findings: Two major categories of dietary pattern scores were identified in the literature: ( 1) studies that examined exposure based on a Mediterranean dietary pattern and ( 2) studies that examined exposure based on dietary guidelines recommendations. In adults, adherence to a Mediterranean diet score or a dietary guidelines -related score is associated with decreased risk of obesity, with some reported variation based on gender or body weight status. This protective association in adults is further supported by consistent evidence indicating that an increased Mediterranean diet score or dietary gui delines -related score is associated with decreased body weight, BMI, waist circumference, or percent body fat, with some variation based on gender and race. Evidence Summary Overview Description of the Evidence A total of 14 studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review and were categorized based on dietary pattern exposure. Two major categories were identified (appendix A) : (1) studies that examined exposure based on a Mediterranean dietary pattern and ( 2) studies that examined exposur e based on dietary guidelines recommendations. Taken together, there were six studies on Mediterranean diet 2010), scores and dietary guidelines indices (Lassale , 2012; Woo, 2008) and one study that used a trial -based customized score (Jacobs , 2009). Two of the studies were RCTs of positive quality (Estruch , 2006; Jacobs , 2009). Twelve of the studies were prospective cohort studies; of these, ten were of positive quality were of neutral quality (Tortosa , 2007; Woo , 2008). The studies were carried out between 2006 and 2012. The sample sizes for the RCTs were from 187 to 769 subjects. The sample sizes for prospective cohort studies ranged from 732 to 373,803 participants ( 2 studies <1,000, 7 studies >1,000, 2 studies >10,000, and 1 study >100,000). RCT duration ranged from 3 to 12 months and observational study follow -up times from 1.5 to 20 years. Studies were conducted in the United States , Hong Kong , and Europe, including the ten European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy , the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) of the EPIC -PANACEA project. Of the six studies on the Mediterranean dietary pattern alone, four studies were conducted in study was the European multicenter study that was part of EPIC -PANACEA (Rom aguera , 2010), and one study was conducted in the United States (Rumawas , 2009). Of the six studies conducted on dietary guidelines -based indices, three studies were conducted in the United States with U .S.-based indices (Berz, 2011; Gao, 2008; Zamora , 2010), one study was conducted in Germany w ith an index developed in the United States (Cheng, 2010), and one study was conducted in France using a French index (Kesse -Guyot , 2009). The studies that compared Mediterranean diet scores and dietary - guidelines ba sed indices were conducted in France (Lassale, 2012) and Hong Kong (Woo, 2008) , and the one study that used a trial- based customized diet score was conducted in Norway (Jacobs , 2009). Ten out of twelve of the prospective cohort studies were conducted with generally healthy adults with a mean age of 25 to 63 years; however, two studies were conducted with children and adolescents (one with girls) (Berz, 2011; Cheng, 2010). The two RCTs were conducted in adults with elevated chronic disease risk: one stu dy with a Mediterranean diet intervention on older adults at increased CVD risk with >90 percent overweight or obese (Estruch , 2006), and one study using an a priori diet intervention on men with metabolic syndrome (Jacobs , 2009). Studies varied in baselin e weight status and ranged from <10 percent to >90 percent of subjects being overweight or obese, with the mid -range between 20 to 40 percent overweight or obese. Lastly, one of the studies was focused on Black, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Chinese participant s (Gao , 2008) , and one study was focused on Black and Caucasian young adults (Zamora , 2010); both of these studies examined ethnic/racial -specific differences in outcomes. Evidence Summary Paragraphs Mediterranean Dietary Pattern 1. Estruch et al., 2006 (positive quality) conducted a parallel, multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Spain, the Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea (PREDIMED) study, to assess the effects of a Mediterranean diet on primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in a high -risk group of men and women. Subjects either had type 2 diabetes or three cardiovascu lar disease risk factors and 90 percent were overweight or obese. The PREDIMED trial assigned participants to three interventions: ( 1) Mediterranean diet with olive oil, ( 2) Mediterranean diet with mixed nuts, and (3) low -fat diet. This was the first report at 3 months of a 4- year clinical trial. The trial included 769 subjects with average age of 69 y ears. Dietary intake was assessed with a validated 137 -item FFQ and the degree of adherence was assessed with a 14 -item Mediterranean diet score that is based on a version of the MDS that assesses a cardio -protective Mediterranean diet . The Mediterranean diet score increased in the two Mediterranean diet groups of the trial and remained unchanged in the low -fat group. There were no significant changes in body weight and adiposity within or between groups from baseline to the 3 months . The authors concluded that b ecause the subjects had CVD risk factors, the fact that body weight did not increase was positive because there was no weight gain, even though the Mediterranean diet interventions involved ad libitum diets supplemented with unsaturated fats, such as those contained in olive oil and nuts. 2. Beunza et al., 2010 (positive quality) reported on a prospective cohort study in Spain, the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) study, to examine the association between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary patter n and long -term weight change and incid ence of overweight or obesity. This analysis of the SUN cohort of university graduates included 10,376 participants with a mean age of 38\u00b111 y ears who were f ollowed for approximately 6 y ears. Dietary intake was assessed with a semi -quantitative 136 -item FFQ validated in Spain and adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was assessed usin g the Trichopoulou MDS (2003). Dietary i ntake was Dietary Patterns 21 assessed biennially. Subject exposure was assessed in tertiles of low (0 -3), medium (4 -6), and high (7 -9) adherence to the MDS. Participants with highest adherence to the MDS had lower average yearly weight gain, - 0.059 kg/y (95% CI = - 0.111 to - 0.008 kg/y; P for trend = 0.02), than participants in the lowest adherence group. Ho wever, the MDS was not associated with incidence of overweight or obesity in participants who w ere normal weight at baseline. The authors concluded that adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was significantly associated with reduced weight gain. F urther, the authors interpret their results in a highly ed ucated Mediterranean population (i.e., low risk) to indicate that this dietary pattern could be recommended to slow age -related weight gain. 3. Lassale et al. , 2012 (positive quality) conducted on a prospective cohort study in France to examine the relationship between diet quality and development of obesity by comparing the predictive value of six different dietary scores on weight change and risk of obesity. Subjects were participants in the SUppl ementation en VItamines et Minereaux AntioXydants (SU.VI.MAX) study. This analysis included 3,151 adults, aged 45 to 60 years, followed for 13 y ears. Dietary intake was assessed with 24 -hour diet records collected every 2 mont hs and records for the first 2 years of the study were used to determine baseline dietary habits. Diet quality was assessed using the MDS, rMED, MSDPS, the Diet Quality Index -International (DQI -I), the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Adherence Index (DGAI), and the French Program me National Nutrition Sante -Guidelines Score (PNNS -GS). Overall, better adherence to a Mediterranean diet (except for the MSDPS) or dietary guidelines was associated with lower weight gain in men who were normal weight at baseline (P for trend = <0.05). In addition, among the 1,569 non -obese men at baseline, the odds of becoming obese associated with one standard deviation increase in dietary score ranged from OR = 0.63 (95% CI = 0.51 - 0.78) for the DGAI to OR = 0.72 (95% CI = 0.59 - 0.88) for the MDS, onl y the MSDPS was non- significant. In women, no association between diet scores and weight gain or incidence of obesity was found. The authors concluded that adherence to a Mediterranean diet or dietary guidelines, except MSDPS score, were associated with lo wer 13-year weight gain and lower obesity risk for men, while no associations were observed for women. 4. Mendez et al. , 2006 (positive quality) reported on a prospective cohort study in Spain, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutri tion (EPIC)- Spain study, to examine if adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern was associated with reduced incidence of obesity. Analysis of the EPIC -Spain cohort included 27,827 participants, age range 29 to 69 years that were f ollowed for approximately 3 years. Dietary intake was assessed with a validated, computerized diet -histor y instrument with > 600 items. Mediterranean dietary pattern adherence was assessed using a slight modification of the Trichopoulou MDS (2003), with exposure expressed in tertiles of low (0 -3), medium (4- 5), and high (6 -8) adherence. Participants with highest MDS adherence had reduced incidence of obesity when overwe ight at baseline. Women were 27 percent and men 29 percent less likely to become obese (women OR = 0.69 [95% CI = 0.54 - 0.89]; men OR = 0.68 [95% CI = 0.53 - 0.89]). High MDS adherence was not associated with incidence of overweight in subjects who were normal weight at baseline. When individual MDS score components were assessed, obesity incidence was higher in women who consumed more meat and lower in men who consumed more cereals (P<0.05). The authors concluded that promoting eating habits consistent with a Mediterranean dietary pattern may be useful in efforts to combat obesity. 5. Romaguera et al. , 2010 (positive quality) reported on a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted in ten countries across Europe, the EPIC -Physical Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol Consumption, Cessation of Smoking, Eating out of Home, and Obesity (EPIC -PANACEA) study. This study examined the association between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, prospective weight change, and the incidence of overweight or obesity. Analysis of the EPIC -PANACEA cohort included 373,803 participants, age range 25 to 70 y ears, followed for 5 years. Dietary intake was assessed with country -specific FFQs and adherence was assessed using the relative Mediterranean Diet Score (rMED), a variation on the Trichopoulou MDS (2003), that assessed 9 components in g/1000 kcal for energy density. Subjec t exposure was assessed in tertiles of low (0 -6), medium (7 -10), and high (11 - 18) adherence to the rMED. Participants with high rMED adherence gained less weight in 5 y ears than did participants with low rMED adherence ( -0.16 kg [95% CI: - 0.24 to - 0.07 kg] ). The contribution of each rMED scoring component was also assessed and it was found that the association between rMED and weight change was no longer significant when meat and meat products were not part of the score. The likelihood of becoming Dietary Patterns 22 overweigh t or obese in participants with high rMED adherenc e was OR = 0.90 (95% CI = 0.82 - 0.96) when compared to the low adherence group. Lastly, a meta- analysis of the OR scores of all 10 European countries showed that a 2 -point increase in rMED s core was associ ated with 3 percent (95% CI = 1 - 5%) lower odds of becoming overweight or obese over 5 y ears. The authors concluded that promoting the Mediterranean dietary pattern as a model of healthy eating may help prevent weight gain and the development of obesity. 6. Rumawas et al. , 2009 (positive quality) conducted a prospective cohort study using a subset of the Framingham Offspring and Spouse (FOS) stud y, which was conducted in the United States . The study examined the association between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and metabolic syndrome, including abdominal adiposity. The study analyzed 2,730 participants with a mean age of 54 y ears for metabolic syndrome traits including waist circumference, and subgroup of 1,918 participants for incid ence of metabolic syndrome, over a 7 -year period. Dietary intake was assessed using the Harvard semi -quantitative FFQ of 126 items and adherence was assessed using the Mediterranean -style dietary pattern score (MSDPS) based on the Mediterranean diet pyrami d. The MSDPS has 13 components scored 0 to 10 based on servings per day or servings per week. Subject exposure was assessed in quintiles of low to high adherence to the MSDPS. Participants with a higher MSDPS had significantly lower wai st circumference (P for trend < 0.001). The authors concluded that their study suggests that consumption of a diet consistent with the principles of a Mediterranean -style diet may protect against metabolic syndrome in Americans. 7. Tortosa et al. , 2007 (neutral quality) repo rted on a prospective cohort study in Spain, the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) study, to examine the association between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and metabolic syndrome, including abdominal adiposity. This analysis of the SUN cohort of university graduates included 2,563 participants initially free of metabolic syndrome (mean ages not reported) who were followed for 6 y ears. Dietary intake was assessed with a semi -quantitative 136 -item FFQ validated in Spain and adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was assessed using the MDS of Trichopoulou. Dietary intake was assessed biennially. Subject exposure was assessed in tertiles of low (0 -2), medium (3- 5), and high (6 -9) adherence to the MDS. Participants in the highest tertile of adherence to the MDS had lower waist circumference, - 0.05 cm over 6 y ears (P for trend = 0.038), compared to the lowest tertile. The authors concluded that this study provided evidence of an inverse relationship between MDS adherence and cumulative in cidence of metabolic syndrome. 8. Woo et al. , 2008 (neutral quality) reported on a prospective cohort study in Hong Kong to examine dietary factors that predispose pe ople to overweight or obesity. The study analyzed 732 participants with a mean age of 45 years over a period of 5 to 9 y ears. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated FFQ and adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the Trichopoulou MDS (2003). In addition, food variety was assessed by the ratio of variety of snacks to the variety of grains and meat. Diet quality was also assessed using the Diet Quality Index International (DQI -I). Incidence of overweight or obesity was calculated by dividing the number of subjects with normal BMI at baseline who became overweight or obese (N - >Ow/Ob) by the number with normal BMI at baseline. In multivariate analysis, increased adherence to either the MDS or DQI -I was associated with a slight, but not significant, increase in the risk of becoming overweight (OR =1.35 [95% CI = 0.94 - 1.93] and OR = 1.32 [95% CI = 0.92 - 1.89, respectively) when defined by the Asian criteria (BMI >23 kg/m2). Increased snack and food variety ratios were associated with increased risk of becoming overweight when defined by the Asian criteria (BMI >23 kg/m2), however, there was no association when overweight defined as BMI >25 kg/m2 was used. This study showed no association between Mediterranean diet adherence, or diet quality assessed by DQI -I, and the development of overweight. The authors concluded that inc reased variety of snack consumption may predispose to weight gain over a 5 - to 9-year period. Dietary Guidelines- Related Patterns Note: Lassale 2012 et al . (2012 ) and Woo et al . (2008) (described above) conducted studies that assessed both Mediterranean diet pattern scores and dietary -guidelines related indices. 9. Berz et al., 2011 (positive quality) reported on a prospective cohort study to assess the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern on BMI in adolescent females in the United States . The Dietary Patterns 23 Prospective National Growth and Health Study followed 2,327 girls aged 9 to 10 y ears over a 10- year period. Dietary intake was assessed using a 3 -day food record collect ed for each year of the study. Diet qu ality was assessed using a modified DASH food group score, reflecting adherence to a DASH eating pattern as described in the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans . The score contained 10 food groups, three of which were excluded for the modified score used in this study: added sugars, discretionary f ats and oils, and alcohol. The seven DASH -related groups in the modified score included fruits, vegetables, low -fat dairy, total and whole grains, lean meats, and nuts, seeds , and legumes. Subject exposure was a ssessed as quintiles of DASH score. Overall, girls in the highest vs . lowest quintile of DASH score had an adjusted mean BMI of 24.4 vs . 26.3 kg/m2 (P<0.05). The strongest individual food component predictors of BMI were total fruit and low -fat dairy. Whole -grain consumption was more weakly, but inversely, associated with BMI. The authors concluded that adolescent girls whose diet more closely resembled the DASH eating pattern had smaller gains in BMI over the 10 -year period. T his suggests that this eating pattern could help prevent excess weight gain during adolescence. 10. Cheng et al., 2010 (positive quality) analyzed data from a prospective cohort study conducted in Germany, the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Long itudinally Designed (DONALD) study, to examine if the diet quality of healthy children prior to puberty was associated with body composition at onset of puberty. The final sample included 222 children, mean age 7.4 y ears, who were followed until the onset of puberta l growth spurt (Age at Take- Off = ATO). Dietar y intake was assessed with 3 -day weighed food records. Adherence to a diet pattern was assessed by the Nutritional Quality Index (NQI) or the Revised Children's Diet Quality Index (RC -DQI). The NQI determine the extent to which a child meets the nutritional recommendation for particular nutrients. The RC -DQI rated diet quality by scoring childrens' intakes in relation to the U.S. dietary intake recommendations. Thirteen dietary components were consider ed, including a proxy for energy balance. Subject exposure was assessed as high, medium, and low diet quality for both indices. Results showed that for both indices, a higher dietary quality was associated with a higher energy intake. Children with a lower diet quality according to their RC -DQI score had lower BMI and Fat Mass Index (FMI) Z -scores at baseline (P<0.01) but not at ATO. Lower NQI in pre- puber ty was associated with a ~0.4 y ear-earlier ATO than children with a higher diet quality (P=0.02). The authors concluded that diet quality was not independently associated with body composition at ATO. Children with lower diet quality according to a nutrient density -based index appear to enter puberty at an earlier age, independent of pre- pubertal body composition. 11. Gao et al., 2008 (positive quality) reported on a prospective cohort study of White, African American, Hispanic, and Chinese men and women in the Multi -Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) in the United States . The objective of the study wa s to assess the diet quality of a multi ethnic population using and comparing the HEI -1995 and a modified version, the HEI -05, in ability to predict obesity outcomes, as well as whether their predictive ability differed by ethnicity. A total of 6,236 subjec ts with mean age of 63 y ears were recruited from four ethnic populations and followed -up at 18 months. Dietary intake was assessed using a 120- item FFQ that included typical Hispanic and Chinese foods. Diet quality was determined using the HEI -1995 and the HEI-05, a modified HEI developed by the authors and based on the 2005 DGA, but distinct from HEI -2005. The HEI -05 used the same components, weighting, and scoring rules as the original HEI, but further adjusted the food group components to incorporate lev els of caloric need based on gender, age, and activity level, as specified in the 2005 DGA. For the overall population, there was an inverse association between quintiles of each HEI score and BMI and waist circumference (WC) (P<0.001). The risk of obesity in normal weight participants was inversely assoc iated with HEI scores only for W hites (P<0.05). A comparison of the HEI -1995 and HEI -05 scores indicated that beta -coefficients, as predictors of body weight and BMI, were h igher for the HEI -05 scores in W hites. The authors concluded that their changes to the original HEI resulted in an HEI that was better at predicting obesity outcomes in a multi -ethnic population, although the improve ment was primarily seen in the W hite population. The authors qualified t his conclusion in the Discussion and stated that the HEI -05 was only slightly better than the original HEI in predicting both cross -sectional baseline and follow -up obesity outcomes. 12. Kesse -Guyot et al., 2009 (positive quality) conducted a prospective cohort study in France to examine the association between adherence to a dietary score based on nutritional guidelines and changes in body weight, body Dietary Patterns 24 fat distribution, and obesity risk. Subjects were participants in the SUpplementation en VItamines et Mi nereaux AntioXydants (SU.VI.MAX) study and the score was the Programme National Nutrition Sante\u00b4 guidelines score (PNNS -GS), based on assessing adherence to 2001 French national guidelines for the general population. This study followed a to tal of 3,531 adults, aged 45 to 60 y ears, for 6 y ears. Dietary intake was assessed using 24 -hour diet records every 2 months, covering all days of the week and seasons. Adherence to dietary guidelines was assessed using the PNNS -GS that includes 12 nutritional components : fruit and vegetables, starchy foods, whole grains, dairy products, meat, seafood, added fat, vegetable fat, sweets, water and soda, alcohol, and salt. The last PNNS -GS component is physical activity. In fully adjusted models , an increase of one PNNS -GS u nit was associated with lower weight gain ( P=0.004), lo wer waist circumference gain (P=0.01), l ower waist -to-hip ratio gain (P=0.02), and lower BMI gain (P=0.002). An increase of 1 PNNS -GS unit was associated with a lower probability of becoming overweight (including obese), OR = 0.93 ( 95% CI: 0.88 - 0.99). Similarly, an increase of 1 PNNS -GS unit was associated with a lower probability of becoming o bese, OR = 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80 - 0.99). The authors concluded that their study showed that nutritional guidelines can play a role in the prevention of age -related weight increase and the development of obesity. 13. Zamora et al., 2 010 (positive quality) analyzed data from the prospective cohort study, Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA ), wh ich was conducted in the United States , to examine the association between diets consistent with the 2005 DGAs and subsequent weight gain in Black and W hite young adults. The CARDIA study followed 4,913 participants (average age 25 y ears) over 20 y ears. Dietary intake was assessed with a quantitative 100 -item diet -history questionnaire. Diet quality was assessed using DQI -2005 to determine adherence to 10 components of the 2005 DGAs: total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, added sugars, reduced -fat milk, fru it, vegetables, whole grains, nutrient -dense foods , and limited sodium and alcohol intake. The study results differed by race. A 10 -point increase in DQI score was associated with a 10 percent lower risk of gaining 10 kg in normal - weight Whites , but w ith a 15 percent higher risk in obese B lacks (P<0.001). The mean adjusted 20- year weight change was +19.4 kg for Blacks and +11.2 kg for W hites with high DQI (DQI >70) and +17.8 kg for B lacks and +13.9 kg for W hites with a low DQI (DQI<50) (P<0.05). The authors concluded that a diet consistent with the 2005 DGAs was assoc iated with more weight gain in Blacks, particularly obese B lacks , but with less weight gain in Whites. However, even W hites with a high DQI score gained weight over the 20 -year study period. Ther efore, they concluded that a diet consistent with the 2005 DGAs was not beneficial for long- term weight maintenance in young American adults. Other Scores: 14. Jacobs et al., 2009 (positive quality) conducted a randomized controlled trial in Norway, the Oslo Diet and Exercise Study (ODES), to examine the effect of changes in diet patterns on body weight and other intermediate metabolic markers of chronic disease risk. The final sam ple included 187 men, mean age 45 y ears, who met the criteria for metabolic syndrome. Subjects were randomly assigned to: ( 1) the diet protocol, (2) the exercise protocol, (3) the diet + exercise protocol , or (4) the control protocol. The trial duration wa s 12 months. Dietary intake was assessed with a validated 180 -item FFQ. An a priori diet score, developed by the authors, was used to determine adherence to the intervention. The diet score was based on summing tertile rankings of 35 food -group variables w ith postulated beneficial, neutral, or adverse effects on health. A higher score reflected the recommended dietary changes in the ODES trial. Over the year of the study, the diet score increased by 2 \u00b15.5 in both diet groups, with a decrease of an equivalen t amount in the exercise and control groups. The weight change was - 3.5 kg/10- point change in diet score (P<0.0001). Similarly, per 10- point change in diet score, waist circumference decreased by 2.8 cm (P<0.0001) and percent body fat decreased by 1.3 perc ent (P<0.0001). Additionally, when the results related to diet score were adjusted for intervention group these body size changes were attenuated, but still significant. Subjects with a higher diet score also had more favorable changes in other markers of metabolism. The authors concluded that a more favorable diet pattern was associated with improved body size and metabolic profile. Dietary Patterns 25 Qualitative Synthesis of the Collected Evidence Themes and Key Findi ngs for Total Scores and Indices Intermediate Outcomes: Body Weight, BMI, Waist Circumference, Percent Body Fat The intermediate outcomes included in this review were body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and percent body fat. Overall, seven studies reported on body weight, four reported on BMI, fiv e reported on waist circumference, and one reported on percent body fat (table 4-A-I-1). Body Weight : Six out of seven studies that examined body weight found that an increase in Mediterranean diet score or dietary guideline index was associated with improved body weight in adults. Based on total scores, four studies reported a protective association, including an association between the MDS a customized a priori score (Jacobs , 2009) and body weight. Two studies reported mixed results. Lassale et al . found a protective association bet ween MDS, and PNNS -GS and body weight in men, but not in women. Zamora et al . found a protective association between the DQI -2005 and body weigh t in normal weight Caucasians but increased body weight in obese Blacks. One study found no effect of a Mediterranean diet intervention on body weight in at -risk elderly (Estruch , 2006). BMI: Of the four studies that assessed BMI independent of risk of overweight or obesity, two wer e conducted with adults using HEI scores or the PNNS -GS (Gao , 2008; Kesse -Guyot , 2009) and two were conducted with children and adolescents using the Revised Children's (RC) -DQI or a DASH score (Cheng , 2010; Berz 2011). The two studies in adults found an a ssociation between an increased dietary guidelines index and decreased BM I over time, although the multiethnic MESA study found this primarily in Caucasians (Gao , 2008). The two studies in children and adolescents examined pre- puberty to puberty onset (Che ng, 2010) or the adolescent period (Berz , 2011) with differing results. Although Cheng et al . found no association between the RC -DQI score and BMI at puberty onset in boys and girls, Berz et al . found that girls in the highest quintile of DASH score had t he smallest gains in BMI throughout adolescence. Waist Circumference and Percent Body Fat : Waist circumference was measured as a component of metabolic syndrome and five studies assessed this measure of abdominal adiposity. All of these studies were consistent in that they found an inverse association between a score or index and waist circumfer ence over although the MESA study found this association primarily in Caucasians (Gao , 2008). Jacobs et al. also assessed changes in percent body fat and found that an increase in a customized a priori diet score was associated with a decrease in percent body fat in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Taken together, the majority of studies found that an increase in Mediterranean diet score or dietary guideline- related index was associated with some measure of improved body weight or composition in adults. The MDS, followed by the rMED and PNNS -GS were the most commonly applied scores associated with a protective outcome.

The results varied across the studies on the Mediterranean diet scores and dietary guideline indices ( tables 4-A-I-1 and 4- A-I-3). Association : Two studies found a protective, inverse relationship between either a Mediterranean score (rMED) or dietary guidelines index (PNNS -GS) and risk of normal weight individuals becoming overweight or obesity over 5 to 6 y ears (Romaguera , 2010; Kesse -Guyot a meta -analysis of the ten EPIC -PANACEA countries and showed an association between a continuous increase in rMED score and a decrease in odds of normal weight individuals becoming overweight or obese. Dietary Patterns 27 Mixed As sociation: There were varied results in three studies. Lassale et al. found an inverse association between the MDS, rMED, (but not MSDPS), DQI -I, obese individuals bec oming obese over 13 y ears only in men. For women, there was no association of any diet score with obesity risk; however , there was a non -significant reduction in obesity risk with an increase in rMED or PNNS -GS. Other studies reported no differences by gender or did not assess men and women separately. Gao et al. examined Black, Caucasian, Hispanic , and Chinese Americans in the MESA study to determine if ethnicity impacted the association between either of two HEI scores and incidence of overweight or obesity. They found that the ability of HEI scores to predict risk of obesity was significant only in Caucasians. Mendez et al. examined the 3 -year incidence of normal weight individuals developing overweight and overweight individuals developing obesity. They found an inverse associat ion between MDS score and likelihood of overweight individuals becoming obese, but no association for normal weight individuals becoming overweight. The mixed results in these three studies are discussed further below related to methodological differences in weight categories across studies. Null Association: There were null findings reported in two studies. Woo et al. assessed adherence to the MDS and DQI-I and incidence of normal weight individuals becoming overweight or obese in an ethnic Chinese population from Hong Kong. They found no association between the MDS or DQI -I and development of overweight, even by the A sian standard of BMI 23 kg/m 2, or obesity over 5 to 9 y ears. Beunza et al . assessed adherence to the MDS and incidence of normal weight individuals becoming overweight or obese and found the MDS was not associated with incidence of ov erweight or obesity o ver 6 y ears. These studies are discussed further below related to methodological differences in weight categories across studies. Differences in weight categories across studies: The method by which these studies assessed risk of overweight or obesity varied in terms of how weight categories at baseline and follow -up were operatio nalized. As indicated in Table 4-A-I-1, analysis of weight gain included changes from ( 1) normal weight to overweight; ( 2) normal weight to obese; (3) normal weight overweig ht and obese; or ( 4) non- obese to obese. Three studies that followed normal weight individuals for development of overweight ( BMI 25 to <30 kg/m 2) found no protective effect of adherence to the MDS (Mendez, 2006; Woo, 2008), HEI (Gao , 2008) , or DQI -I (Woo , 2008). Gao et al . and Woo et al . also assessed normal weight individuals becoming obese (BMI 30 kg/m2); Gao reported an association onl y in Caucasians; whereas, Woo reported no association between dietary guidelines index and obesity. The three studies that assessed normal weight individuals for development of overweight or obesity (BMI 25 kg/m2) found inconsistent results. Beunza et al., found no association between the MDS and incidence of overweight or obesity. However, Romaguera et al. and Kesse -Guyot et al. found there was an inverse association between the rMED or the PNNS -GS, respectively, and risk of becoming overweight or obese. These studies were all conducted in Europe and compared the same weight status over a similar time p eriod, although they used different scores to assess diet exposure. Additionally, the SUN cohort examined by Beunza et al . was relatively young (mean age 38.4 y ears) with >90 percent non-obese participants. A fourth weight status comparison was assessing t he risk of non -obese ( BMI 30 kg/m2) individuals . and Kesse -Guyot et al. assessed non -obese individuals becoming obese in the same SU.VI.MAX cohort. Kesse- Guyot found an inverse association between the PNNS -GS and obesity incidence; whereas, Lassale found an inverse association between several diet scores and obesity incidence in men but not women. When viewed based on the method by which weight categories were operationalized, three studies showed that adherence to a dietary pattern was not associated with risk of normal weight individuals becoming overweight (Gao, 2008; Mendez, 2006; Woo , 2008), although the Gao study showed that adherence was associated with risk of normal weight individuals (Caucasians) becoming obese (Gao , 2008); two out of three studies showed an association with risk of normal weight individuals develop ing overweight or obesity (Romaguera , 2010; Kesse - Guyot , 2009); two out of two studies found an association with risk of non- this only in men; and one study showed an association with risk of overweight individuals becoming obese (Mendez , 2006). Dietary Patterns 28 Themes and Key Findings for Components of Scores and Indices: Components of Mediterranean Diet Pattern Scores and Dietary Guidelines -Related Indices Three studies assessed the association between individual components of a Mediterranean diet score or dietary guidelines index and weight change or incidence of overweight and obesity. Mendez et al . found that when individual components of the MDS were ass essed, overweight and obesity incidence was higher in women, but not men, who consumed more meat; whereas, obesity incidence was lower in men, but not women, who consumed more cereals. Romaguera et al. found that the association between rMED adherence and weight change was only significant when the meat and meat products component was included in the score. Both the MDS and rMED are population -based scores, with the cereal component including whole and refined grains, and the meat component defined as meat and poultry in the MDS and total meat including processed meat in the rMED. In the Prospective National Health and Growth study in girls, BMI was assessed throughout adolescence for association with average intake of four DASH food groups: total fruits, ve getables, whole grains, and low -fat dairy over 10 y ears (Berz , 2011). Total fruit, low -fat dairy, and to a lesser extent whole grains had a beneficial association with BMI over this time period. Components across All Scores and Indices The scores or indices that were associated with the clinical endpoint of interestrisk of overweight or obesity were the MDS, rMED, HEI -1995 and a customized DGAI, and PNNS -GS. (Although association with MDS (Beunza , 2010; Woo, 2008) or DQI -I (Woo , 2008) in low -risk or Asian populations, respectively.) Scores or indices that were associated with decreased risk of overweight or obesity in adults were selected to examine commonalities in components across scores related to the clinical ly significant outcome, rather than intermediate or surrogate markers of outcomes. (The components of these scores ar e described in detail in t able 4-A-I-2.) These scores include the MDS, rMED, and PNNS -GS that were also the most commonly applied scores as sociated with a protective outcome in body weight, BMI , or waist circumference in adults. The MSDPS was not associated with either endpoint obesity outcomes or intermediate outcomes including body weight and BMI, although Rumawas et al. found an inverse association between MSDPS and waist circumference. Lastly, although this review included a study that utilized the DASH score (Berz, 2011), they did not consider the clinical outcomes of overweight or obesity in analyses, and thus, the DA SH score was not included in the comparison below. Berz et al . reported that the DASH score was associated with BMI in girls throughout adolescence, but they did not assess adults.

Along with other diet scores, both Lassale et al. and Woo et al. used the DQI -I that has 4 groups of components as follows: Variety: overall food group variety (0- 15 points); within- group variety for protein source (0- 5 points).

Given this caveat, the food groups, as well as foods or nutrients, that were included as positi ve components in these scores were fruits (MDS and rMED specified fruits and nuts; DQI -I and DGAI added fruit variety), vegetables (rMED excluded potatoes; DGA I gave positive points for dark-green and orange vegetables and penalized for overconsumption of starchy vegetables; DQI -I and DGAI added vegetable variety); whole grains, in some combination with refined grains in cereals, flour, pasta, rice, and bread; legumes; fish (MDS and rMED) or seafood (PNNS (rMED), MUFA/SFA ( MDS), PUFA/MUFA/SFA (DQI -I), percent SFA (HEI, DQI -I, DGAI), or added fats and added vegetable fats (PNNS -GS). Moderate alcohol intake was commonly included as a positive component, with different cut-offs for men and women; exception s were the HEI that did not include alcohol and the DQI -I that included alcohol as part of the empty calorie foods. There was inconsistency in the way meat and dairy were evaluated. The Mediterranean diet scores assessed meat (MDS included meat and poultry; rMED included meat and processed meats) and dairy (rMED included low - and high-fat milk, yogurt, cheese , and desserts) negatively. For dietary guidelines indices, meat and dairy were scored based on meeting recommended servings, with maximum point s for meeting guidelines and proportional negative points for percent deviation (with the exception of the HEI that did not deduct points for overconsumption). The DQI-I included meat and dairy in both the food group and protein variety components. There were additional components included only in some indices. The DGAI, PNNS -GS, and DQI -I included added sugar, sweetened foods, or empty -calorie foods (foods low in nutrient density, including sugar), respectively; these were scored negatively ab ove a speci fied percent energy intake or below a specified level of nutrient density for the DQI-I. The PNNS -GS also negatively scored sweetened beverages, in relation to water consumption, under a separate beverage component. The dietary guidelines -related indices h ad additional components including sodium (or salt), cholesterol (not PNNS -GS), and trans fats (only DGAI). Three of the dietary guidelines indices included diet variety (DQI -I, DGAI, and HEI). Furthermore, the DQI -I score that predicted the lowest odds of non- obese men becoming obese in the Lassale et al . study included many components not pr esent in other scores or indices. These were food group variety and within- group variety in dietary protein (both noted above for meat and dairy); adequacy that included vegetables, fruits, cereals, fiber, protein, iron, calcium , and vitamin C; the above e mpty -energy foods; and in addition to a PUFA/MFA/SFA ratio, a macronutrient carbohydrate/protein/fat ratio. Overall, the DQI -I was more nutrient -based than food- based, compared to the other sco res and indices. Woo et al., in addition to the MDS and DQI -I, also looked at food variety and found that variety in snack consumption was associated with weight gain. Taken together, the positive components of the scores or indices that were associated with decreased risk of obesity in one or more studies were frui ts (MDS and rMED included nuts with the fruit component), vegetables, whole grains, legumes, unsaturated fats , and fish. Alcohol was commonly included as a positive component when consumed in moderation. Meat and dairy, with some variations, were negative components in Mediterranean scores or recommended within specific ranges for dietary guidelines indices. The dietary guidelines indices also included saturated fat and cholesterol, or added non -vegetable fats, as negative components above a specified level of intake. Lastly, the sugar or sweets component was included and scored negatively in three out of the four dietary guidelines - related indices, although similar components were not included in either the MDS or rMED. Qualitative Assessment of the Collected Evidence Quality and Quantity Quality assessment for the studies included in this systematic review involved determining the validity of each study. Validity was assessed by examining the scientific soundness of study design and execution to avoid potential bias in the findings related to outcomes. This can include selection, performance, attrition, detection, or reporting bias. As the preponderance of the evidence consisted of positive quality studies (12 out of 14 studies), this indicates a low risk of bias. In terms of quantity, the majority of these studies were prospective cohort studies with large numbers of participants in nationally recognized cohorts. Dietary Patterns 32 Consistency The evidence of a protective association between a dietary pattern score and change in body weight over time was consistent in the majority of studies that used either a Mediterranean diet score or dietary guidelines index in healthy adult populations, although there were differences reported based on gender and race. The evidence related to other intermediate markers such as changes in BMI and waist circumference was also consistent. However, there was more variation in the endpoint outcome of incidence of overweight or obesity, including within study variation based on gender, race, and weight status, and between stud y variations in health outcomes. Inconsistency across these studies could be due to differences in the health outcomes measured, variability in the study populations, or differences in assessment of adherence to a given dietary pattern. Although overweight and obesity were similarly defined according to BMI cutoff points (except Woo et al .), there were differences in the way baseline weight status (e.g., normal weight or non- obese) and follow -up weight status were categorized, which could have contributed t o inconsistency in results. This variation could also contribute to risk of bias due to outcome measures. Furthermore, some studies calculated overweight and obesity risk separately by gender or race, while others only assessed the pooled population. Acros s the studies, there were differences in populations as well. The two RCTs were conducted in different at- risk populations. Although the majority of prospective cohort studies were conducted in Europe, th ere were differences in cohorts; for example, age an d weight status of the baseline population in the SUN cohort compared to EPIC cohorts. Lastly, the assessment of dietary exposure in these studies was determined using a large number of different Mediterranean diet pattern scores and dietary guidelines -related indices. Impact This body of evidence directly addressed the interventions/exposures and health outcomes of interest for this systematic review. Overall, several large prospective cohort studies found a decrease in incidence of overweight and obesit y associated with adherence to a Mediterranean diet score or dietary guidelines index. Although not clinical trials, these cohort studies reported results that are applicable in free -living populations. For example, in the largest study, EPIC -PANACEA, Roma guera et al. reported that a change from lowest to highest rMED adherence reduced the likelihood of normal weight individuals becoming overweight or obese in 5 y ears by 10 percent . It should be noted, however, that not all studies found this protective association. Generalizability/External Validity The preponderance of the evidence related to the Mediterranean dietary pattern involved large prospective cohort studies conducted i n Europe, with four out of eight studies conducted in Spain. In terms of generalizability related to the American population, o ne study was conducted in the United States , and this study assessed waist circumference as a component of metabolic syndrome (Ru mawas , 2009). Therefore, although there was evidence with high quality studies on the Mediterranean dietary pattern in Europe, there was limited data regarding the U .S. population and intermediate outcomes and no data on incidence of overweight and obesity . Related to dietary guidelines patterns, four studies examined U .S. populations, but only two studies focused on healthy adults. Both of these studies included more heterogeneous ethnic/racial groups than the European studies, as one focused on multi -ethnic outcomes from the MESA cohort (Gao , 2008) and one, the CARDIA study, focused on differences between Black and Caucasian young adults (Zamora, 2010). Both of these studies found a protective effect of adherence to an a priori index only in Caucasians. The remaining dietary guidelines related studies were conducted in France, Hong Kong, Germany, and Norway. Given the limited evidence involving U .S. cohorts, the relevance of this body of evidence to U .S. policy on dietary patte rns and risk of overweight and obesity would seem to depend on the extent to which results from studies conducted with large European cohorts can be applied to the United States . One of the benefits of doing an index/score -based analysis is that investigat ors can compare across cohorts because food components are chosen a priori and are independent of specific populations (although the numeric scoring of dichotomous scores, such as the MDS, are based on median population intakes) . Studies, such as that cond ucted by Lassale et al . that assessed both Dietary Patterns 33 Mediterranean diet scores and U .S.-based (as well as French) dietary guidelines indices, with similar predictive values for obesity, at least in men, provide some further evidence that findings from studies conducted with large European cohorts may be applicable to U .S. populations. This is supported by the fact that the European countries and the U nited States are classified as \"very high\" Human Development Index countries. Furthermore, although individual s tudies may not be representative of the population of interest, consistent findings across studies may suggest broad applicabil ity of the results (Viswanathan , 2012). Limitations of the Evidence Limitations of the studies included in this systematic review, and potential reasons for differences and inconsistencies in results, include the use of different scores; differences between scores that are based on median population intakes versus indices that are based on recommended intakes; the use o f diffe rent confounding factors or lack of sufficient adjustment for confounding factors; the problems associated with the use of different FFQs and validation related to other methods of diet assessment; and the handling of underreporting. Furthermore, in the majority of studies, total scores or indices were used and there was no separate analysis of individual score components and their potential association with outcomes. The application of the total score to the diet pattern analysis has the potential to \"dilu te\" the effect of individual components. However, the assessment of individual components without interaction terms assumes that a given component has an independent association which potentially contradicts the theoretical rationale for examining the over all dietary pattern. Lastly, another common limitation was the single measurement of dietary intake at baseline. This does not take into account that diets change over time due to trends in the food supply and population- level and individual -level changes in food choices.

Most striking is the need for consensus on a single index or score that is applicable across populations for a diversity of outcomes. If it is not feasible that one index can adequately assess the diversity of populations related to dietary patterns, research should be conducted to determine the best method by which components are chosen, grouped, and scored and whether or not the research tool is population based or independent of the population, so that there is uniformity across scores. The studies included in this review were focused on total scores, rather than component scores and their association with health outcomes. To strength en the analysis of component scores, the interaction terms across components need to be assessed in order to maintain a dietary patterns approach. For prospective cohort studies, diet intake should be measured at multiple time points with assessment of die tary changes over the time as they relate to health outcomes.

MacNeil , Joan Lyon, and Joanne M. Spahn Are prevailing patterns of diet behavior in a population, assessed using factor or cluster analysis, related to body weight or risk of obesity? TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review project is to identify patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Historically, most dietary guidance has been based on research conducted on individual food compone nts or nutrients. Dietary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Factor and cluster analys is allow examination of the relationship between prevailing dietary patterns of a population and outcomes of public health concern. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between patterns of food and beverage intake identifi ed using factor and cluster analysis, and risk of obesity. Conclusion Statement Limited and inconsistent evidence from epidemiological studies examining dietary patterns derived using factor or cluster analysis in adults found that consumption of a dietary pattern characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains , and reduced -fat dairy products tends to be associated with more favorable body weight status over time than consumption of a dietary pattern dominated by red meat, processed meats, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, and refined grains . (Grade: III-Limited ). Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts) and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns defined using factor or cluster analysis and risk of obesity. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the review: Hum an subjects; Ages: 2 years and older; Populations: Healthy and those with elevated chronic disease risk; subjects from countries with high or very high human development (based on the 2011 Human Development Index); randomized controlled trials, non -random ized controlled trials, or quasi- experimental studies; Sample size: Minimum of 30 subjects per study arm; Dropout rate less than 20 percent ; Study assesses dietary intake using factor and cluster analysis; study considered body weight and risks of overweight and obesity; published in English in a peer -reviewed journal. The date range for the conduct of studies was unlimited. The results of each included study were summarized in evidence worksheets (including a study quality rating) and evidence table. A gr oup of subject matter experts were involved in a qualitative synthesis of the body of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the strength of the evidence (grade) using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the quality , quantity, consistency, magnitude of effect, and generalizability of available evidence. Dietary Patterns 41 Findings Eleven prospective cohort studies, rang ing in length from 3 to 20 y ears, examined dietary patterns and their association with body weight. To derive dietary patterns, seven studies used factor analysis and four studies used cluster analysis. Eight st udies were conducted in the United States , with three additional studies from the United Kingdom , Iran, and Denmark. Sample sizes ranged from 206 to 51,670 participants . Variability in the studies included in this review, including populations considered, dietary assessment methods used, the number and type of food groupings included in the analyses, and the statistical techniques employed, made comparisons among studies challenging. The number of patterns identified in the studies ranged from 2 to 6 and some similarities emerged among them. The patterns were not consist ently defined by specific foods but rather by a range of foods with overlap am ong the patterns. What differentiated the patterns was the amount or frequency of each food consumed. Dietary patterns derived from factor or cluster analysis that were associated with lower risk of obesity were characterized by the presence of vegetables , fruit, whole grains , and reduced -fat dairy. In adults, results pointed toward a more favorable weight status, lower weight/waist circumference (WC) gain, and lower body mass index (BMI) over time . Dietary patterns that emerged in factor or cluster analysis associated with a higher risk of obesity were characterized by the presence of red meat and processed meats, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, and refined grains. Results related to consumption o f these patterns pointed toward increased body weight and waist circumference measures over time. Discussion The ability to draw strong conclusions was limited due to the following issues: In factor and cluster analysis, the consolidation of food items into food groups, the number of factors or clusters to extract, and even the labeling of components are subjective. Furthermore, patterns derived from either factor or cluster analysis may not be reproducible across studies because elements of dietary patterns and analytic decisions differ. Dietary pattern analysis using factor or cluster methods may not be very informative in determining which elements of the diet or which biological relationships between these elements are responsible for the health outco me. Some studies completed over long periods of time did not account for changes to subjects' diets or seasonal variations in food supplies, which may have influenced the food components of patterns. The patterns derived through analyses may not represent the most beneficial or detrimental patterns relative to the health outcome of interest. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY How combinations of foods and beverages, or dietary patterns, impact body weight In the past, researchers looked at the relationship between individual foods and nutrients and health. Today, ther e is interest in looking at how combinations of foods and beverages, or dietary patterns, impact health. Statistical methods called factor and cluster analyses can be used to describe the patterns of f oods and beverages people eat. This summary of a NEL review presents what we know about dietary patterns of certain groups of people described using factor and cluster analysis and the likelihood of becoming overweight or obese . Dietary Patterns 42 Conclusion Limited an d inconsistent evidence from epidemiological studies examining dietary patterns derived using factor or cluster analysis in adults found that consumption of a dietary pattern characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains , and reduced -fat dairy products tends to be associated with more favorable body weight status over time than consumption of a dietary pattern characterized by red meat, processed meats, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, and refined grains. What the Research Says Results from the 11 studies included in this review tell us that dietary patterns high in vegetables, fruits, low -fat dairy products, and whole grains may prevent adults from gaining weight. Consuming a diet pattern high in red meat, processed meats, sugar -sweetened foods an d drinks, and refined grains may increase the likelihood of weight gain in adults. EVIDENCE PORTFOLIO Conclusion Statement Limited and inconsistent evidence from epidemiological studies examining dietary patterns derived using factor or cluster analysis in adults found that consumption of a dietary pattern characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains , and reduced -fat dairy products tends to be associated with more favorable body weight status over time than consumption of a dietary pattern c haracterized by red meat, processed meats, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, and refined grains. Grade III - Limited Key Findings: Cluster and factor analyses are data- driven approaches that describe the dietary patterns consumed by the study population. Variability in the studies included in this review, including populations considered, dietary assessment methods used, the number and type of food groupings included in the analyses, and the statistical techniques employed, made comparisons among studies challenging. The number of patterns identified in the studies ranged from 2 to 6 and some similarities emerged among them. The patterns were not consistently defined by specific foods, but rather by a range of foods with overlap among the patterns. What di fferentiated the patterns was the amount or frequency of each food consumed. Dietary patterns that emerged in factor or cluster analysis that were associated with lower risk of obesity were characterized by the presence of vegetables, fruit, whole grains , and reduced -fat dairy. In adults, results pointed toward a more favorable weight status, lower weight/waist circumference (WC) gain, and lower body mass index (BMI) over time. Dietary patterns derived from factor or cluster analysis associated with a hig her risk of obesity were characterized by the presence of red meat and processed meats, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, and refined grains. Results related to consumption of these patterns pointed toward increased body weight and waist circumference meas ures over time. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status were often not reported or included in analyses . Insufficient evidence was available to support conclusions related to children and adolescents. Dietary Patterns 43 Evidence Summary Overview Description of the Evidence Factor and cluster analyses are data- driven approaches that empirically derive food intake patterns (appendix A) . A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review (table 4 -A-II-1). All studies were prospective cohort studies, and 10 of 11 received a positive quality rating. Eight of the eleven studies were conducted in the United States , with additional studies from the United Kingdom . (McNaughton, 2007) , (Newby , 2006) . The sample sizes for the studies were from 206 to 51,670 participants ( 3 studies <500, 4 studies <2,500, 1 study < 4500, and 3 >30,000). The follow -up times for these observational studies ranged from 3 to 20 y ears. The majority of the studies were conduct ed with generally healthy adult men and one study (Ritchie , 2007) was conducted i n children to examine weight gain in adolescence over the period of follow -up. In general, the strengths of these studies include their prospective design and length of follow -up. Dietary intake in these prospective cohort studies was assessed using various methods . Six studies used food frequency questionnaires ranging from 26 to 168 dietary assessment of three cohorts was by diet records of 3, 5, or 7 days using a diet history questionnaire (Duffey , 2012) . To derive dietary patterns , seven endpoint outcomes of interest in this review were measures of weight status. Three studies examined change in body weight; seven studies reported on BMI; and six studies r eported on waist circumference. One study each examined percent body fat and incidence of overweight/obesit y. In eight of the studies, the outcomes were measured by study personnel; in three studies, body weigh t Paragraphs Boggs et al., 2011 (positive quality) conducted a prospective cohort study in the U.S.to assess dietary patterns in relation to weight gain using data from the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) in 1995, 2001, and 2009. Participants (n = 41,351), ranging in age from 21 to 54 years old, self -administered a 68 -item FFQ in 1995 and an 85-item FFQ in 2001. FFQ items were aggregated into 35 predefined food groups on the basis of similarity of nutrient content. Two major dietary patterns were identified using factor analysis (principal components analysis): \"Vegetables/Fruit\" (vegetables, fruit, legumes, fish, and whole grains) \"Meat/Fried Foods \" (red meat, meat, fries, fried chicken, and added fat) Overall, there was no signifi cant association between 14 -year weight gain and the \"Vegetables/Fruit\" pattern. In a subsample (12,736) of women who maintained approximately the same dietary patterns over time (remained within one quintile of their 1995 dietary patterns), the \"Vegetables/Fruit\" pattern was associated with significantl y less 14 - year weight gain overall (highest compared with lowest quintile: 10.88 and 11.94 kg, respectively; P for trend The \"Meat/Fried Foods\" pattern was not signif icantly associated with 14 -year weight gain overall. However, mean weight gain w as significantly greater in the highest quintile relative to the lowest quintile of the \"Meat/Fried Foods\" pattern among women with normal weight at baseline (10.77 compared with 10.09 kg; P for trend = 0.002). Among women who maintained the same dietary p atterns over time, the \"Meat/Fried Foods\" pattern was associated with significantly greater 14 -year weight gain overall (highest compared with lowest quintile: 12.02 and 10.15 kg, respectively; P for trend < 0.001). The authors concluded that these finding s indicate that African American women Dietary Patterns 44 may achieve long -term weight maintenance by consuming a diet high in vegetables and fruit and low in red meat and fried foods. Duffey et al., 2012 (positive quality) conducted a pros pective cohort study in the United States to examine the association of different dietary patterns with or without diet beverage consumption and the risk of cardiometabolic outcomes, using data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Participants (n = 4,161), ranging in age from 18 to 30 years old, responded to a validated, interviewer -administered CARDIA diet history questionnaire, followed b y a quantitative diet history. Foods and beverages from the baseline diet history were categorized into 43 food groups by using the Nutrition Coordinating Center algorithm, measured as e nergy per day from food group. The \"diet beverages\" food group (measured by servings per day) was used to identify baseline consumers of diet beverages, and these groups were labeled \" consumers\" and \"nonconsumers.\" Two distinct baseline dietary patterns were identified using cluster analysis: \"Prudent diet\" (fruit, milk, yogurt, cheese, nuts, seeds, fish, and whole grains) \"Western diet\" (meats, poultry, refined grains, soda, fast food, fruit drinks, egg and egg dishes, legumes, and snacks) Results related to waist circumference (WC) showed no significant differences between \"Prudent diet\" and pattern diet\" nonconsumers had lower ri sk of high waist circumference than \"Western diet\" consumers. The authors concluded that overall dietary pattern and diet beverage consumption are important, to various degrees, for different metabolic outcomes. Hosseini -Esfahani et al., 2011 (positive qu ality) extracted a subset of data from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), a prospective cohort study conducted in Iran, and used factor analysis to determine whether changes in food pat terns were related to obesity. The data was from tw o periods of the TLGS survey: 1999 -2001 and 2005- 2007. Participants (n = 206), mean age 42 years old, answered a 168 -item FFQ. FFQ items were then aggregated into 21 food groups according to macronutrient composition. During the two stages of study, three dietary patterns were identified: \"Healthful\" (high intake of fruit, vegetables, dairy, oil, whole grains, poultry, and fish) \"Western\" (high intake of processed meats, fat, salty snacks, fatty sauces, and sweet beverages) \"Mix\" (high- fat red meats, legumes, nuts and seeds, sweets, tea, and coffee) Changes in each food pattern score were calculated by subtracting each factor score obtained in 1999 -2001 from the corresponding values obtained in 2005- 2007. In a multivariate adjust ed model, overweight/obese individuals (=0.41 R\u00b2=0.22, the tota (=0.30 R\u00b2=0.21, P< 0.05) who had increased \"Western\" pattern scores showed increases in BMI. No significant relationship was found between change in the \"Mix\" pattern score and alterations in BMI or W C. Subjects in the highest quartile for changes in the \"Healthful\" pattern score showed a significantly smaller change in waist -to-hip ratio (WHR) compared to those in the lowest quartile, the reference group (= -0.77 R\u00b2=0. 43, P <0.01). This trend was seen before and after adjusting for confounding variables. No significant relationship was observed between changes in WHR and changes in the scores for either the \"Western\" or the \"Mix\" patterns. The authors concluded that incr eased adherence to the \"Western\" pattern and decreased adherence to the \"Healthful\" pattern could contribute to obesity. McNaughton et al., 2007 ( positive ) analyzed data from the Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development ( NSHD), also known as the 1946 British Birth Cohort, to assess the relationship between dietary patterns during adult life (at ages 36, 43, and 53 y ears) and risk factors for chronic disease at age 53. The dietary data was collected in 1982, 1989, and 1999 and risk factors were measured in 1999, when subjects were age 53 years. Dietary intake was assessed at each time point using a 5-consecutive -day food diary. Foods and beverages consumed in 1982, 1989, or 1999 were allocated to one of 126 food groups. The distribution of foods and beverage item consumption was highly skewed, so a binary variable was created for each item (consumers or nonconsumers). Dietary Patterns 45 Exploratory factor analysis was conducted and dietary patterns consistent across the three time points were identifi ed (described further in Mishra, 2006). For women, three dietary patterns were identified: \"Ethnic foods and alcohol\" (Indian and Chinese meals, rice and pasta, oily fish and shellfish, olive oil, some vegetables , and alcoholic beverages ( particularly red and white wine) \"Meat, potatoes, and sweet foods\" (red meat, bacon and ham, all types of potato and potato dishes, sweet pies, cakes, puddings , and desserts with negative loadings for pasta and skimmed milk) \"Fruit, vegetables, and dairy\" (low-fat/reduced -fat dairy products, fruit, some vegetables , and whole meal bread, with negative loadings for meat, meat products , and white bread) For men, two dietary patterns were identified: \"Ethnic foods and alcohol\" (Indian and Chinese meals, rice and pasta, shellfish, olives, some vegetables and legumes, and alcoholic beverages [particularly red and white wine] , with negative loadings for meat pies, fried chips , and animal fats) \"Mixed\" (many fruits and vege tables, low-fat/low -calorie yog urt and soya milk and a range of sweet foods including cakes, sweet biscuits, sweet pies, puddings, desserts, confectionery , and ice cream) Stability assessment of agreement betwe en tertile categories over the three time points show ed that the \" ethnic foods and alcohol ,\" \"fruit, vegetables, and dairy ,\" and the \"mixed\" patterns presented fair to moderate agreement (k = 0.28- 0.44); agreement for the \"meat, potatoes, and sweet foods\" pattern wa s poor. Overall, in women, the \"fruit, vege tables, and dairy\" pattern was inversely BMI (P<0.004), and waist circumfe rence (P=0.0007). In men the \"mixed\" pattern score and waist circumference were signif icantly inversely associated (P= 0.02). However, BMI was not significant after ad justment for confounders. The authors concluded that specific dietary patterns throughout adult life were associated with chronic disease risk factors. Newby et al., 2003 (positive quality) and Newby et al., 2004 (positive quality) conducted a pro spective cohort study in the United States to evaluate the nutritional etiology of changes in BMI and WC by dietary intake pattern, using data from the Baltimor e Longitudinal Study of Aging. Participants (n = 459), age range 30 to 80 years old in 1980, completed 7 -day dietary records. Then , cluster and factorial analysis were used to define dietary patterns: In 2003, the food intake data were aggregated into 41 food groups based on macronutrient composition and culinary use, and five food patterns were identified using cluster analysis: \"Healthy\" (high -fiber cereal, fruit, and reduced -fat dairy) \"White bread\" (refined grains, poultry, meat, and high-fat dairy) \"Alcohol\" (refined grains and alcohol) \"Sweets\" (refined grains, fruits, high -fat baked goods, meat, and high-fat dairy) \"Meat and potatoes\" (refined grains, fruit, meat, and high -fat dairy) Results showed that the mea n annual change in BMI was the \" Meat -and-potatoes\" pattern, which showed a greater annual increase in BMI (=0.25; 95% CI: 0.07 - 0.43; P< 0.05) than the \"Healthy\" pattern. The WC mean annual cha nge was 0.43\u00b1 0.27 cm for the \"Healthy\" pattern (P<0.05), and 1.32\u00b1 0.29 cm for the \"White -bread\" pattern, which showed a significantly greater annual increase WC (=0.90 cm; 95% CI: 0.12 - 1.68; P< 0.05) than the \"Healthy\" pattern. The authors concluded that consuming a diet high in fruit, vegetables, reduced -fat dairy , and whole grains and low in red and processed meat, fast food, and soda was associated with smaller gains in BMI and waist circumference. Dietary Patterns 46 In 2004, the f ood intake data were aggregated into 40 food groups according to macronutrient composition and culinary use, and six factors or pat terns were identified using prin cipal component analysis, and then patterns were treated categorically (i.e., divided into quintiles): \"Factor 1: Reduced -fat da iry products, fruits, and fiber\" (nuts, seeds, legumes, white bread, and refined grains) \"Facto r 2: Protein and alcohol\" (seafood and poultry) \"Factor 3: Sweets\" (sweetened juices, dairy desserts, and fast food) \"Factor 4: Vegetable fats and vegetables\" (starchy vegetables, white bread, and refined grains) \"Factor 5: Fatty meats\" (organ meats, n onwhite bread, vegetables, fruits, and processed meats) \"Factor 6: Eggs, bread, and soup\" (whole grains) For all subjects, the mean annual change in BMI was 0.11 kg/m2, and the mean annual change in WC was 0.84 cm. The smallest annual change in BMI was i n the highest quintile of fact or 1 for women ( -0.12\u00b10.09; P< 0.05), but not significantly for men (0.02\u00b10.08; P> 0.05). Mean annual change in WC was smallest in quintile 5 of factor 1 (0.18 \u00b10.28 cm; P> 0.05) for both sexes. Because BMI was significantly modif ied by sex, analysis was separated: for women, quintile 5 of factor 1 was inversely associated with an annual change in BMI in comparison with quintile 1 (=-0.51: 95% CI: - -0.20; P <0.05) test for trend was P< 0.01. For men, BMI annual change was not signif icantly different in factor 1. Factor 2 was directly associated with change in BMI (quintile 5 vs. 1); (=0.20; test for trend was P= 0.05. The authors concluded that a pattern rich in reduced -fat dairy products and high- fiber foods may lead to smaller gains in BMI in women and smaller gains in waist circumference in both women and men. Newby et al., 2006 (positive quality) conducted a prospective cohort study in Sweden to examine whether changes in food patterns were associated with changes in BMI using data of the Swedish Mammography Cohort in 1987 and 1997. Participants (n = 33,840 women), mean age 52.5 years old, self -administered a 65 -item FFQ in 1987 and a 97- item FFQ in 1997. Food groups were created according to fat and fiber content, culinary use, and previous research on the study of food patterns and body composition. Due to minor differences in d ietary assessment at each time, 29 groups were created in 1987, while 32 groups were created in 1997. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to derive food patterns in each set of food groups: \"Healthy \" (vegetables, fruit, whole grains, fruit juice, and cereals) \"Western/Swedish\" (meat, processed meat, liver, potatoes, and refined grains) \"Alcohol\" (wine, spirits, snacks, beer, and chocolate) \"Sweets\" (sugary foods, sweet baked goods, soda, chocolate, fr uit soup, refined grains, and dairy desserts) The strongest effects of the relation between change in food pattern and change in BMI were observed in women who were obese at baseline. The \"Healthy\" pattern factor score analyses found that obese women had larger decreases in BMI (= -0.18 kg/m 2 for a unit increase in SD score, CI : -0.26 to - 0.10; P<0.0001), while normal - weight and overweight women showed smaller increases in BMI ( -0.05 kg/m2 The \"Sweets\" pattern analyses found that obese subjects who increased their factor scores had the smallest decreases in BMI (=0.17 kg/m 2 for a unit increase in SD score, CI: 0.07 to 0.26; P=0.0008), compared with BMI increase of 0.04 kg/m2 (P<0.005) in overweight wome n. No significant differences were found in normal -weight women. In all BMI groups, women whose \"Healthy\" pattern score decreased more than three standard deviations gained the most weight. The authors concluded that changes in eating patterns were signifi cantly related to changes in BMI over 9 years, and the effect was modified by baseline BMI. Quatromoni et al., 2002 (positive quality) conducted a pro spective cohort study in the United States to explore relationships between dietary patterns and the development of overweight (BM I 25) over a period of 12 y ears using data from female participants in the Framingham Offspring -Spouse study (FOS). Participants (n = 737), age range 30 to 89 years ol d, answered a 145 -item FFQ. FFQ items were classified into 42 foods groups based on similar levels of macronutrients and key micronutrients, and then 13 food groupings were identified, each conta ining multiple food categories. In a second step, women were separated into groups with no overlap groups based on Dietary Patterns 47 similarities in their frequency of consumption of the 13 food groupings. Five clusters were identified through this process: \"Heart healthy\" (vegetables, fruits, low -fat milk, other low -fat and fiber -rich foods, whole grains, fish, low -fat cheeses, lean poultry, legumes, and fewer servings of diet beverages) \"Light eating\" (more moderate eating patterns and higher consumption of beer and poultry with skin) \"Wine and moderate\" (more moderate eating patterns and higher consumption of wine) \"High fat\" (high amounts of animal and vegetables fats, sweet desserts, meat, and mixed dishes) \"Empty -calorie\" (high amounts of animal and vegetables fats, sweet desserts, meat, mixed dishes, and sweetened beverages) Among women who were not overweight (BMI<24), after 12 -year follow -up, overweight rates were lowest in the \"Wine and moderate\" and \"Heart healthy\" clusters and highest among those in the \"Empty -calorie\" cluster. Overall, there was a 17 percent absolute incr ease in risk among women who ate an \"Empty calorie\" diet pattern compared with those who followed a \"Heart healthy\" pattern. The relative risk for developing overweight was higher among women in the \"Empty calorie\" pattern compared with women in the \"Heart healt hy\" pattern (RR=1.4; 95% CI=0.9 - 2.2). These results were attenuated in the multivariate model, adjusting for age, menopausal status, and other behavioral factors. There was no observed increased risk associated with any of the other dietary pattern s. The authors concluded that behavioral interventions for weight management and obesity prevention may be enhanced by targeting differences in eating patterns, dietary quality, and other lifestyle factors of distinct groups of the population. Ritchie et al., 2007 (positive quality) analyzed data from a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States to determine the relation of dietary patterns with nutrient intakes and measures of adi posity over a period of 10 y ears using data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study (N GHS) Cohort. Participants were Black and W hite girls (n = 2,371), age range 9 to 10 years old at baseline, who recorded their dietary intake for 3 days (2 weekdays, 1 weekend) on an annual basis. Food intakes were combined into 40 food groupings based on frequency of usage, contribution to total energy intake, and customary use in the diet. Cluster analysis was used to def ine four separate patterns for Black girls and W hite girls. For B lack girls, the patterns were: \"Customary\" (low intakes of diet drinks, coffee/tea, yogurt, cheese, plain grains, crackers, fish/poultry [not fried], red meat, other soups, and most vegetables) \"Snack -type foods\" (high intakes of diet drinks, coffee/tea, yogurt, crackers, pretzels, other soups, and green salads, and low intakes of flavored milks, several other grain groupings, and processed meats/sandwic hes) \"Meal -type foods\" (high intakes of plain breads and grains, other breakfast grains, and most types of sandwiches and protein sources, including legumes, fried and not fried potatoes) \"Sweets and cheese pattern\" (large amounts of sweets and flavored mi lk and cheese, with relatively small amounts of many other foods , for example, eggs, fried fish/poultry, and fried potatoes) For W hite girls, the patterns were: \"Convenience\" (high intakes of pizza, fried fish/poultry, and ramen, with relatively low intak es of juice, pla in milk, many of the grain- type groupings, eggs, unfried fish/poultry, cheese/spread sandwiches, other soups, fruit, and most of the vegetable -rich groupings) \"Sweets and snack -type foods\" (high intakes of sweetened and diet drinks, juice, cheese, other desserts, candy, crackers, pretzels, nuts/popcorn, peanut butter and cheese -spread sandwiches, and mixed dishes, with low intakes of flavored milk, processed meats/sandwiches, and mixed dish es) \"Fast -food pattern\" (high intakes of flavored milk, burgers, fried potatoes, eggs, red meat, processed meats/sandwiches, chips, legumes, and baked desserts, with low intakes of diet drinks, yogurt, cheese, candy, other desserts, crackers, pretzels, and peanut butter sandwiches) Dietary Patterns 48 \"Healthy\" (low intakes of sweetened drinks, baked desserts, chips, fried fish/poultry, red meat, burgers, pizza, and fried potatoes, with relatively high consumption of plain milk, yogurt, plain breads and grains, cereal, other breakfast grains, mixed dishes, other soups, fruit, green salads, unfried potatoes, and other vegetables) For B lack girls, mean BMI, percent body fat, and WC at final follow -up did not differ significan tly by dietary patterns. Among W hite girls, those following the \"Healthy\" pattern had significantly smaller mean WC values at the final follow -up, as well as change in WC, compared with the \"Sweets and snack -type foods\" pattern (P = 0.037). In conclusion, given that most of the dietary patterns identified we re far from optimal, it is not surprising that few were found to be protective against obesity. A notable exception was the \"Healthy\" pattern identified among W hite girls. Schulze et al., 2006 (positive quality) conducted a pros pective cohort study in the United States to examine the association between adherence to dietary patterns and weight change using data from the Nurse's Heal th Study II from 1991 to 1999. Participants, age range 26 to 46 years old, self -administered a 133 -food item FFQ in 1991, 1995, and 1999. Foods from the FFQ were then classified into 39 food groups based on nutrient profiles or culinary usage. The final sample included 51,670 women. Eating patterns defined by princi pal component analysis for each time - point were described as: \"Prudent pattern\" (higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, and salad dressing) \"Western pattern\" (higher intakes of red and processed meats, refined grains, sweets an d desserts, and potatoes) Average weight gain adjusted for baseline age was largest among those women who increased their \"Western\" pattern score (1991 to 1995, 5.20 kg; 1995 to 1999, 3.23 kg; 1991 to 1999, 7.81 kg) and smallest among women who decreased their \"Western\" pattern scores (1991 to 1995, 2.10 kg; 1995 to 199, 0. 85 kg; 1991 to 1999, 4.04 kg; P<0.001). This difference persisted after adjusting for baseline and changes in confounders. The authors concluded that a dietary pattern characterized by frequent consumption of red and processed meats, refined grains, sweets and desserts, French fries, and potatoes may be associated with larger weight gain, while increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, legumes, and oil and vinegar salad dressing may be associated with less weight gain. Togo et al., 2003 (positive quality) conducted a prospective cohort study in Denmark to assess associations between food- intake factor scores and BMI changes, as well as longitudinal associations between changes in food -intake patterns and subsequent changes in BMI using data from the Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases (MONICA) study from 1982 to1994. Participants, age r ange 30 to 60 years old, answered a 26-item FFQ, and factor analysis was used to identify dietary patterns separated by gender. For women, two patterns were found and named as: \"Green\" (high intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and cheese) \"Sweet -Traditional\" (more meat and foods of higher energy density, with fewer vegetables) For men, three patterns were found and named as: \"Green\" (high intakes of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and cheese) \"Sweet\" (baked goods, candy, soft drinks, ice cream, honey, or jam) \"Traditional\" (more meat and foods of higher energy density, with fewer vegetables) Multivariate analyses of the association between food factor scores at baseline and subsequent 5 - and 11- year change in BMI, respectively, revealed inconsistent and minor associations. For example, in men the \"Traditional\" factor score at baseline was inversely associated with subsequent 11 -year change in BMI [ (9 5% CI) = - 0.40 ( -0.78, 0.01); P< 0.05], while the 5 -year difference was not significantly associated with any of the factors scores at baseline [ (95% CI) = -0.06 ( -0.33, 0.21)]. In women, the 5- year change in BMI was inversely associated with the \"Sweet - traditional\" factor score at baseline [ (95 % CI) = - 0.33 ( -0.54, -0.13); P< 0.01], while the association was not significant for the 11- year change [ (95% CI) = - 0.26 ( -0.55, 0.03)]. Neither the baseline factor scores nor the Dietary Patterns 49 change in factor scores between baseline and 5 -year follow -up were found to be associated with obesity at 11- year follow -up, in the fully adjusted model. The authors concluded that in this longitudinal study of a Danish population, food- intake factors could not consistently predict changes in BMI or obesity development.

In total, over 135,000 adults and 2,300 adolescents were examined by studies in this review. Quality assessment of these studies involved an examination of their methodological rigor in order to minimize bias and random error in the systematic review findings. Compo nents of the evaluation included the number and selection of data samples, use of statistical tools, and detection or reporting bias. Ten of eleven of the included studies were found to be of positive quality, indicating a low risk of bias and random error . Consistency The studies in this review did not use a consistent approach for examining the association between dietary patterns and body weight. Both factor and cluster analysis methodologies were used. Factor analysis summarizes a number of original variables into smaller composite factors, while cluster analysis groups individuals into clusters, so that individuals in the same cluster are homogeneous and there is heterogeneity across clusters. In addition, there are several methodological differences within the study designs, including different methods of grouping foods and selecting patterns. Nevertheless, some similarities among the findings can be seen. Most of the studies found at least two generic food patterns: a \"healthy/prudent\" food pattern and an \"unhealthy/western\" pattern. Generally, healthier patterns were associated with more favorable body weight outcomes, while the opposite was seen for unhealthy patterns. However, not all studies rep orted significant associations. Furthermore, because the patterns are data- driven, they represent what was consumed by the study population, and thus it is difficult to compare across the disparate patte rns. Impact This body of evidence directly addressed the diet exposures and examined health outcomes of interest for this systematic review. Overall, the results observed were clinically meaningful from a public health perspective, particularly related to BMI. However the association between dietary patterns and body weight status may be mitigated by the presence of other important lifestyle factors that influence body weight but are difficult to measure. Generalizability/External Validity The total number of studies in this review is not large, but several of them were conducted in large prospective cohort studies. Ethnicity, SES, sex, age, and BMI are among the variables considered when examining generalizability of the result s to the general U .S. population. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status were often not reported or included in analyses, which makes generalizing the results difficult. There was a potential difference in associations found by gender: of the three studies that analyzed men and women separately, men tended to have null results. However, there were insufficient data to draw conclusions about population subgroups. In addition, nearly all the studies were in adults, only one was in adolescent s, and none in young children. For these reas ons, caution should be observed when extrapolating the findings to other populations. Limitations Factor and cluster analyses are data- driven approaches that describe the dietary patterns in a particular population. The studies describe preexisting dieta ry patterns within the population and the dietary patterns are not based on a hypothesized association to health. The patterns derived through analyses may not represent the most beneficial or detrimental patterns relative to the health outcome of interest . Among the studies reviewed, the dietary pattern analyses varied with regard to the dietary assessment methods, the number and type of food groupings, and the statistical analysis techniques, which make comparisons challenging. In factor and cluster an alysis, the consolidation of food items into food groups, the number of factors or clusters to extract, and even the labeling of components are subjective. Furthermore, patterns derived from either factor Dietary Patterns 58 or cluster analysis may not be reproducible across studies because elements of dietary patterns and analytic decisions differ. Dietary pattern analysis using factor or cluster methods may not be very informative in determining which elements of the diet or which biological relationships between these elements are responsible for the health outcome. Some studies completed over long periods of time did not account for changes to subjects' diets or seasonal variations in food supplies, which may have influenced the food components of patterns. One study a nalyzed the dietary patterns of pre- pubescent children transitioning into adolescence. In general, the results show that p atterns vary widely at this age and caution should be observed when analyzing these data because the diet of children changes rapidly, as well as their weight. Research Recommendations Insufficient evidence was available in population subgroups to examine the relationship between dietary patterns derived using factor and cluster analyses and body weight status. Future studies using this methodology should examine variables such as ethnicity, SES, sex, baseline weight status, and age. In additon, it is important to incorporate environmental and behavioral factors, such as physical activity, non -leisure physical activity, eating practi ces (eating out, cooking at home), indulgence over the weekend, among others, as potential confounders These variables may be moderators that in the long term will define the association between a particular pattern and weight status. There is a need for m ore research into specific ethnic groups and how cultural practices may influence dietary p atterns and their repercussions for body weight. Research is needed to further examine if various dietary patterns influence body weight status differently among participants who are normal weight, overweight, or obese. There is some indication that obese versus normal weight individuals respond differently to changes of food patterns on body weigh t measures. Research in this area may help uncover better approaches to body weight management practices. There is a need to examine the most common unhealthy/western pattern components, variations, and amounts of food consumed by those who have such a diet. Rationale: If a pre -existing pattern is found to be detrimental to health, there is an impetus for dietary pattern modification. Dietary Patterns 59 REFERENCES 1.

Obbagy What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using reduced rank regression analysis, and measures of body weight or obesity? TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review project is to identify patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Historically, most dietary guidance has been based on research conducted on individual food components or nutrients. Dietary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when avai lable) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Reduced rank regression (RRR) is a statistical method that determines dietary patterns (combinations of food intake) that explain as much variation as possible among a set of respo nse variables related to a health outcome of interest. It is an a posteriori method since it uses both existing evidence and exploratory statistics . The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between patterns of food and beverag e intake derived by using reduced rank regression, and body weight or risk for developing obesity. Conclusion Statement There are a number of methodological differences among the studies examining the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and body weight status. The disparate nature of these studies made it difficult to compare results, and therefore, no conclusions were drawn. (Grade: Not Assignable) Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts), and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression analysis and risk of obesity. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the review: Human subjects; Ages: 2 years and older; Populations: Healthy and those with elevated chronic disease risk; individuals with chronic disease; published in English in a peer -reviewed journal; Sample size: Minimum of 30 subjec ts per study arm; Dropout rate less than 20 percent ; Study assesses dietary intake using reduced rank regression analysis; study considered body weight and risks of obesity; subjects from countries with high or very high human d evelopment (based on the 2011 Human Development Index). The date range for the conduct of the studies was unlimited. The results of each included study were summarized in evidence worksheets (including a study quality rating) and evidence table. A group o f subject matter experts were involved in a qualitative synthesis of the body of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the strength of the evidence (grade) using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the quality, qua ntity and consistency, magnitude of effect , and generalizability of available evidence. Dietary Patterns 61 Findings There were six prospective cohort studies that examined dietary patterns derived using r educed rank regression analysis and their association with body weight and risks of obesity. The studies ranged in size from 141 to 24,958 subjects. Three studies were conducted in children, two in adults , and four of the studies included both females and males, while one study included only girls. One study each was conducted in the United States , Korea, United Kingdom, Iran , and Germany. The follow -up for these studies ran ged in duration from 22 months to 8 years. The response variables and dietary assessment meth ods used varied widely by study and did not allow conclusions to be drawn across studies. Dietary patterns are based only on foods that are actually consumed, therefore results or outcomes from extracted patterns may be only confirmatory. Food groups were not examined in relation to weight status in these s tudies, and many of the studies used \"roughly similar response variables\" but generated patterns that were varied. Body weight was determined on the basis of observed food component intake, and as such , evaluating food patterns with respect to body weight change is highly dependent on the preceding analysis of carbohydrate, fat , and fiber density. Thus, results for these food patterns need replication using independent data sets. There was lack of consistency in the extracted patterns resulting in a mix of food groups within extracted patterns that are known to be harmful or those known to be protective. This may present limitations in attempting to address issues related to whether food groups within these patterns may act independent of each other (i.e. , what role would whole grains and vegetable s play in a generated pattern that also contains high fat? ) The populations studied also varied widely by country of study, as well as region of the wo rld. Diets consumed by these populations also varied by country making it difficult to translate and generalize the findings. Discussion The ability to draw a gradable conclusion was limited due to the following issues: Each study used different response variables in the reduced rank regression analyses. Two studies used biomarkers including change in BMI, percent body fat, bone mineral c ontent, and bone mineral density as response variables. The second study included fat and b one mass as response variables. Four other studies used nutrients: dietary ener gy density, fiber density, and percent of energy as fat; total fat, carbohydrate, and fiber ; and one used fat, PUFA: SFA ratio, calcium, cholesterol, and fiber as response variables. In reduced rank regression, the dietary patterns identified are those tha t explain the most variation in the response variables chosen. Therefore, because the studies included in this review used different response variables, the dietary patterns derived may not be comparable. Different weight -related outcomes were examined acr oss the studies. The most common outcomes considered in at least four studies were body mass index and fat mass or percentage. T wo studies examined incidence of overweight or obesity and excess adiposity and one stud y examined waist circumference. This var iability made it difficult to identify themes within this body of evidence. Dietary assessment methods were different across the studies. Of the six studies, three used diet, one used 24 - hour recalls, another used both a 24 -hour recall and a diet record, w hile the sixth used a food frequency questionnaire. It is unclear what impacts different dietary assessment methods have on the derivation of dietary patterns using reduced rank regression. The studies were not consistent in their use of confounders in ana lyses. In particular, physical activity was not included as a confounder in the analyses in two studies. Dietary Patterns 62 PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Are the amounts, types, variety , or combinations of foods and beverages p eople frequently eat and drink related to the likelihood of becoming over weight and obese? Researchers have previously looked at the relationship between individual foods and nutrients and health. Today, there is interest in looking at how combinations of foods and beverages intake, or dietary patterns, influence health by applying different scientific methods. A statistical method called reduced rank regression analysis can be used to describe the patterns of foods and beverages people eat based on a set of \"response variables\" that are known to be related to the health outcome of interest. This summary of a NEL review presents what research evidence currently exist when reduced rank regression analysis is the method used to study the dietary patterns of groups of people and their likelihood of be coming overweight and risking obesity. Conclusion There were a number of methodological differences among the studies examining the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and body weight status. The disparate nature of these studies made it difficult to compare results, and therefore, no conclusions were drawn. What the Research Says Six studies looked at dietary patterns found using reduced rank regression analysis and the risk of becoming over weight and obese. Ho wever, these studies had some key issues that make it hard to make any recommendations: There were few studies available. There were many differences in how the studies were done. The populations studied were different between studies. EVIDENCE PORTFOLIO Conclusion Statement There were a number of methodological differences among the studies examining the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and body weight status. The disparate nature of these studies made it difficult to compare results, and therefore, no conclusions were drawn. Grade Not Assignable (IV) Key Findings: Six positive quality prospective cohort studies that used reduced rank regression to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and body weight status were included in this review. However, differences in methodologies used and populations studied prevented comparison across studies, and conclusions could not be drawn. Further research is needed to examine dietary patterns and body weight status using reduced rank regression, preferably with standardized methods and response variables. Dietary Patterns 63 Evidence Summary Overview Description of the Evidence Six prospective cohort studies that used reduced rank regression analysis (see appendix A) to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and body weight were included in this systematic review and Johnson (2008) represent t he UK Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort, but due to variations in methodology used and subjects examined, they are described separately in this review. All of the studies were rated positive quality. Two studies were conducted in the United Kingdom, and one study each was conducted in the United States , Korea, Iran, and Germany. The sample sizes for these studies ranged from 141 to 24,958 participants ( 2 studies <200, 1 study <500, 1 study <1,000, 1 study >6500, and 1 study >24,000). Four studies were conducted in children and two in adults. Five of the studies included both females and males, while one study included only girls (Noh , 2011). The studies in this review used a range of different dietary assessment methods. Three studies u sed 3 -day diet records (Johnson , 2008; Ambrosini , 24 -hour reca ll and a 2 -day diet record (Noh , 2011), one used an FFQ (Schulz recalls (Sherafat -Kazemzadeh , 2010). The in terms of weight -related outcomes examined: Ambrosini ( 2012) examined fat mass index, excess adiposity, B MI, and weight status; Johnson ( 2008) examined fat mass, fat mass index, BMI, weight status, body fat percen tage, and excess a diposity; Noh (2011) examine BMI and body fat percentage; Schulz (2005) looked at annual change in b ody weight; Sherafat -Kazemzadeh (2010) examined BMI, waist circumference, an d waist -to- hip ratio; and Wosje (2010) examined fat mass. The independent vari ables in all six studies were dietary patterns determined with reduced rank regression analysis; however , the response variables used to identify the dietary patterns differed by study. Two studies used biomar kers as response variables (Noh , 2011; Wosje , 2010), and four studies The response variables used and dietary patterns extracted for each study are described in more detail below: Evidence Summary Paragraphs Johnson , 2008 (positive quality) selected dietary energy density (DED), fiber density (FD), and percentage of energy intake from fat as response variables. Three dietary patterns were extracted from a group of children ages 5 to 9 years (a random subsample of the larger ALSPAC cohort) in the United Kingdom . Pattern 1 explained the most variatio n in the response variables (47 percent ) at ages 5 and 7 years. Patterns 2 and 3 explained <20 percent of the variation and were not used in sub sequent analyses. Pattern 1 at 5 years of age was character ized by higher intakes of lower fiber bread, crisp and savory snacks, chocolate and confectionary, high -fat milk and cream, and cheese and cheese dishes, and lower intakes of fresh fruit, vegetables, boiled or baked potatoes, high- fiber bread, a nd high -fiber breakfast cereal. Pattern 1 at 7 years of age was characterized by higher intakes of crisps and savory snacks, chocolate and confectionery, low -fiber bread, biscuits and cakes, processed meat, and lower intakes of fresh fruit, vegetables, high- fiber breakfast cereals, boiled or baked potatoes, and high -fiber bread. Ambrosini (2012) conducted another study in the ALSPAC cohort, this time using data from the full cohort, collected over a lon ger follow -up period. Ambrosini (2012) used the same response var iables (dietary energy density [DED], fiber density [FD], and percentage of energy intake from fat). Three dietary patterns were extracted from a group of children ages 7 to 15 years in the United Kingdom . Pattern 1 explained the most variatio n in the response variables (45 percent ) at all ages. Patterns 2 and 3 explained <15 percent of the v ariation and were not used in subsequent analyses. Similar to the previous report, Pattern 1 was characterized by higher intakes of cho colate and confectionary, lower fiber bread, cakes and biscuits, crisps, and full -fat milk, and lower intakes of fresh fru it, raw/boiled vegetables, high -fiber breakfast cereal, boiled potatoes, and high -fiber bread. Noh, 2011 (positive quality) sel ected change in BMI, change in percent body fat, change in BMC, and chang e in BMD as response variables. Four dietary patterns were extracted. Patterns 1 and 2 explained more variation in the Dietary Patterns 64 response variables (14 percent ) than Patte rns 3 and 4, so these two patterns were used in subsequent analyses. Pattern 1 was characterized by higher intakes of eggs and rice, and lower intakes of nuts and seeds, processed meats, potatoes, and eastern grains. Pattern 2 was characterized by higher i ntakes of fruits, nuts and seeds, milk and dairy products, other beverages, eggs, fruit juices, and eastern grains, and lower intakes of vegetables mushrooms, and kimchi. Schulz , 2005 (positive quality) selected the nutrient densities (g per 1 MJ) of the dietary variables total fat, total carbohydrates , and fiber as response variables. Three dietary patterns were extracted. Pattern 1 explained the most response variation (53 percent of total variation). Patterns 2 and 3 explained on ly 21 percent and 10 per cent of the variation and were not further used in subsequent analyses. Pattern 1 included foods such as whole -grain bread, fresh fruit, fruit juices, grains, cereals , and raw vegetables. Sherafat -Kazemzadeh , 2010 (positive quality) selected fat, polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio, calcium, cholesterol, and fiber intake as response variables. Five dietary patterns were extracted, and all five patterns were used in subsequent a nalyses. Pattern 1 explained 39 percent, Pattern 2 explained 19 percent, Pattern 3 explained 13 percent, Pattern 4 explained 9 percent, and Pattern 5 explained 5 percent of total variation. Pattern 1 (\"traditional pattern\") included sources of hydrogenated and saturated fat, egg, red and processed meat, refin ed carbohydrate s, vegetables, and whole grain and starchy vegetables . Pattern 2 (\"fiber and PUFA pattern\") included plant oils, starchy vegetables, legumes, other vegetables, salty snacks, and fruit and nuts, with negative loadings for dairy products. Pattern 3 (\"fiber a nd dairy pattern\") included fruits and vegetables, dairy, and whole grain, as well as negative loadings for plant oil and egg. Pattern 4 (\"dairy pattern\") included dairy, egg, and plant oil, with negative loadings for saturated and Trans fat, refined carbo hydrates, vegetables, and fruit. Pattern 5 (\"egg pattern\") included egg, fruit, and salty snacks, with negative loadings for dairy, plant and saturated oil, and red meat. Wosje , 2010 (positive quality) selected fat mass and b one mass as response variables. Two patterns were extracted. Pattern 1 explained 13 to 19 percent of variation in the response variab les, and Pattern 2 explained 11 to 18 percent of the variation. Pattern 1 included foods such as whole grains, cheese, processed meats, eggs, fried potatoes, discretionary fats , and artificially sweetened beverages. Pattern 2 included food such as dark -green vegetables, deep - yellow vegetables , and processed meats. Dietary Patterns 65 Overview Table Table 4 -C-III-1.

However, while a sufficient quantity and quality of studies were potentially available, the studies varied substantially in methodology used and populations considered, which resulted in insufficient information from which to draw conclusions about the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and body weight status. Limitations of the Evidence Methodological Differences Each study used different response variables in the reduced rank regression analyses. Two studies used biomar kers as response variables. Noh (2011) used change in BMI, percent body fat, bone mineral content , and bone mineral density as response variables, and Wosje (2010 ) included fat and b one mass as response variables. Four studies used nutrients a s response va riables: Ambrosini (2012) and Johnson (2008) used dietary energy density, fiber density, and percent of energy as fat; Schulze (2005) used total fat, carbohydrate, and fiber, and Sherafat -Kazemzadeh (2010) used fat, PUFA: SFA, calcium, cholesterol, and fib er. In reduced rank regression, the dietary patterns identified are those that explain the most variation in the response variables chosen. Therefore, because the studies included in this review used different response variables, the dietary patterns deriv ed may not be comparable. Different weight -related outcomes were examined across the studies. The most common outcomes considered were body mass i 2012; Johnson, 2008; Noh, 2011; Wosje, 2010). Two studies examined incidence of overweight or obesity and excess adiposity (Ambrosini , 2012; Johnson, 2008). Only one study examined waist circumference (Serafat -Kazemzadeh , 2010). This variabilit y made it difficult to identify themes within this body of evidence. Dietary assessment methods were different across the studies. Of the six studies, thr ee used diet records (Ambrosini , 2012; Johnson, (Sherafat -Kazemzadeh , 2010), another used a 24 -hour recall and a diet record (Noh , 2011), and one used an FFQ (Schulz , 2005). It is unclear what impacts different dietary assessment methods have on the derivation of dietary patterns using reduced rank regression. The studies were not consistent in their use of confounders in analyses. In particular, physical activity was not included as a confounder in the analy ses by Johnson ( 2008) or Noh (2011) . Population Differences Each study was conducted in a different country ( United States , Korea, United Kingdom, Iran, and Germany) and represented populations in different regions of the world, which prevented the ability to compare and interpret the results. The studies were conducted with different age groups , four wi Sherafat -Kazemzadeh , 2010). Even among the studies with children, the age groups were significantly different. Research Recommendations More research using reduced rank regression should be conducted. Additionally, standardization in methodology, particularly in response variables used, is needed.

Altman and Eve Essery Stoody What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/ recommendations or specific dietary patterns (assessed using methods other than index/score, cluster or factor, or reduced rank regression analyses) and body weight status? TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review project is to identify patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Historically, most dietary guidance has been based on research conducted on individual food components or nutrients. Die tary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Different methods of analyses are used to asse ss dietary patterns including index or score, cluster or factor, reduced rank regression, in addition to other methods, to exam the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns of a population and outcom es of public health concern. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between patterns of food and beverage intake identified using methods other than index or score, factor or cluster, or reduced rank analyses, and body weigh t. Conclusion Statement There is moderate evidence that adherence to a dietary pattern that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and whole grains is associated with modest benefits in preventing weight gain or promoting weight loss in adults . (Grade: II-Moderate) Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts), and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns de fined using methods other than index factor or cluster analysis and body weight status. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the revie w: conducted in subjects aged 2 to 18 years; randomized controlled trials, non -randomized controlled t rials, or quasi -experimental studies; subjects from countries with high or very high human development (based on the 2011 Human Development Index); subjects who were healthy or at elevated chronic disease risk; published in English in a peer -reviewed journal. The date range was unlimited. The results of each included study were summarized in evidence worksheets (including a study quality rating) and an evidence table. A group of subject matter experts were involved in a qualitative synthesis of the body of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the strength of the evidence (grade) using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the quality, quantity, consistency, magnitude of effect , and generalizability of available evidence. Findings The Women's Health Initiative (WHI), Mediterranean, Vegetarian, and \"Healthy\" dietary patterns were associated with beneficial body weight outcomes. These dietary patterns consistently emphasized fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Fewer studies considered, but consistently observed benefits, with reduced meat intake. Some studies also considered total fat intake; these studies did not support that targeting a low total fat intake is required for weight loss or stability. Studies includ ed in this review were short to moderate in duration, and individuals with greater adherence to the plant -based dietary pattern experienced better body weight outcomes. Dietary Patterns 69 Additional research is needed to quantify the amounts of food groups that are beneficia l to consume, but, in general, movement to a dietary pattern with more plant foods and less meat is favorable related to body weight status. Discussion The ability to draw strong conclusions was limited due to the following issues: Five of the seven studies included in this review assessed dietary intake using food frequency questionnaires. Additionally, one study assessed dietary patterns by using a simple series of questions. These dietary assessment methodologies have measurement error and also prevent sufficient quantification of dietary intake. The studies did not consistently consider or report calorie intake and/or energy expenditure, which are important to consider when examining body weight status. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Do the amounts, types, variety , or combinations of foods and beverages people frequently eat and drink affect body weight ? In the past, researchers looked at the relationship between individual foods and nutrients and health. Today, there is interest in looking at how combinations of foods and beverages, or dietary patterns, impact health. This summary of a NEL review presents what we know about different healthy eating patterns and the amounts, variety , or combination of different foods and drinks, an d how often they are eaten affect body weight. Conclusion There is moderate evidence that adherence to a dietary pattern that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and whole grains is associated with modest benefits in preventing weight gain or promoting weight loss in adults. What the Research Says Of the seven studies in the review, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), Mediterranean, Vegetarian, and \"Healthy\" dietary patterns were found to be favorable to body weight outcomes. These healthy dietary patterns consistently included fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. A few studies found that eating less meat helped with body weight. Some studies also looked at the effect of total fat in the diet but found that eating a low -fat diet is not required for weight loss or to prevent weight gain. Studies included in this review were short to moderate in length, and persons who closely followed a dietary pattern containing mostly plant- based food had better body weight outcomes. More research is needed to find out the exact amounts of food groups that are good to consume. In the mean time, eating a dietary pattern that contains more plant foods and less meat is better for body weight status. EVIDENCE PORTFOLIO Conclusion Statement There is moderate evidence that adherence to a dietary pattern that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and whole grains is associated with modest benefits in preventing weight gain or promoting weight loss in adults. Grade II - Moderate Dietary Patterns 70 Key Findings The Women's Health Initiative (WHI), Mediterranean, Vegetarian, and \"Healthy\" dietary patterns were associated with beneficial body weight outcomes.

Some studies also considered total fat intake; these studies did not support that targeting a low total fat intake is required for weight loss or stabilit y.

Evidence Summary Overview Description of the Evidence: Four randomized 2011; Romaguera, 2011; Rosell , 2006) were included in this review. All seven studies received a positive quality rating, and one was rated neutral. Four st udies were conducted in the United States , one in the United Kingeom , one in Italy, and one in fi ve European countries (Italy, United Kingdom , Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark). The sample sizes for the randomized controlled trials ranged from 140 to 46,808 participants, and the prospective cohort studies had sample sizes of 2,437 to 48,631 participants (in total, 2 studies <200, 2 studies <5,000, 1 study <25,000, and 2 studies > 45,000). All seven studies were conducted in adults. Five studies included men and women, and two studies included only postmenopausal women. The duration of the randomized controlled trials ranged from 4 months to 7.5 years, and the duration of the prospective cohort studies ranged from 5.3 years to 10 years (in total, 1 study <1 y ear, 1 study = 2 years, 3 st udies 6 y ears, 2 studies 10 years). Dietary patterns examined: The dietary patterns examined in the randomized controlled trials were the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, a Mediterranean diet, and the low -fat dietary pattern from th e Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Dietary Modification (DM) trial (2 studies). In these studies, the dietary intake of the participants was assessed, and the participants receiving the intervention modified their diets in the direction of the dietary patte rn of interest. The diets examined in the prospective cohort studies were vegetarian, a generally healthy pattern, and a variety of empirically derived patterns ranging in healthfulness according to their scoring on the Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index ( DGAI). Two of the prospective cohort studies also examined the change in dietary patterns among pa rticipants over time (Pachucki , 2011; Rosell , 2006). Table 4 -A-IV-2 provides an overview of the study characteristics and provides a description of the dietar y patterns examined in the studies. Dietary assessment: Five studies in this review assessed dietary intake using FFQs. All of the FFQs were validated, and three studies used FFQs specifi c for the research study (Carty , 2006; FFQ with 4-day food diaries (Blumenthal , 2010). One study assessed dietary intake using weekly diet diaries and assessed dietary adherence usi ng 3-day food records (Esposito , 2004). One study categorized dietary intak e based on responses to four 'Yes/No' questions asking participants if they consumed meat, fish, eggs, or dairy products (Rosell , 2006). Outcomes considered: Five studies examined change in body weight, and four studies examined change in BMI. In four of t hese studies, height and body weight we re measured by study personnel. One study used self -reported height and weight (Rosell , 2006); however, they conducted a validity study and found self -reported and measured height and weight to be highly correlated ( r>0.09). Three studies considered waist circumference. In all of these studies, baseline WC was measured by study personnel. In one study, WC at follow -up was self -reported (Romaguera, 2011); however, they conducted a Dietary Patterns 71 validity study and found that self-reported WC could be used as a proxy for measured WC if adjustments were made in analyses. Two studies assessed change in percent body fat. Both of these studies assessed body fat using DXA. One study examined incidence of overweight and obesity, and height and weight were measured by study personnel in this cohort. Themes This body of evidence included a diverse group of studies that varied in the methodologies used and the dietary patterns considered. The randomized controlled trials examined the W omen's Health Initiative (WHI) -Dietary Modification (DM) (Howard , 2006; Carty , 2011), the DASH pattern (Blumenthal , 2010), and a Mediterranean pattern (Esposito , 2004). The prospective cohort studies examined Vegetarian diets (Rosell , 2006), a \"generally healthy\" pattern (Romaguera, 2011), and seven empirically derived dietary patterns ranging in healthfulness based on the Dietary Guide lines Adherence Index (Pachucki , 2011). All of the patterns associated with beneficial body weight outcomes emphasized plan t foods, particularly vegetables, fruit, and whole grains. The remaining features of the dietary patterns varied. Total fat intake was considered in all four of the randomized controlled trials included in this review but was not assessed in the analyses of the three prospective cohort studies. Three articles studied patterns that were designed to be low in fat. One of the goals of the WHI -DM trial was to r educe fat intake to 20 percent (Howard , 2006; Carty , 2011). However, whi le energy from fat decreased ~8 percent from approximately 39 percent at baseline, this goal was not reached; yet beneficial outcomes related to body weight were observed. The DASH study was also low in total fat (25 percent of energy intake), but there was no significant effect of this diet alone on weight status; only the group that combined the DASH diet with calorie restriction experienced weight loss greater than the control group. Finally, Esposito and colleagues (2004) examined a Mediterranean dietary pattern that pr omoted moderate fat intake (<30 percent total fat and <10 percent saturated fat) as well as olive oil and walnut consumption and found reduced body weight, BMI, and WC compared to the controls. Overall, the body of evidence did not support that a dietary pattern mus t be low in fat to promote weight loss or stability. Meat intake was considered in the t hree prospective cohort studies but not specifically in the four randomized controlled trials. Pachucki et al. (2011) and Rosell et al. (2006) associated increased meat intake with greater weight gain, and less meat intake with more favorable body weight outcomes. Rosell et al. (2006) also reported that mean annual weight gains were lowest among individuals who moved toward eating a vegan diet. Romaguera et al. (2011) indicated that a diet lower in processed meat intake was associated with less abdominal obesity. Overall, these observati onal studies indicated a benefit to reducing meat intake. The studies in this review ranged in duration f rom 4 months to 10 years. The 4- month DASH intervention trial included two study arms: one isocaloric and one with a caloric restri ction of 500 kcal/d (Blumenthal , 2010). Over the intervention period, the DASH diet alone did not result in significant weight loss compared to the control group. However, the group with calorie restriction did. The longer term RCTs t hat examined the WHI -DM (Howard , 2006; Carty, 2011) and Mediterranean (Esposito , 2004) patterns observed favorable body weight outcomes over time compared to controls. Further, Howard et al. (2006) reported that greater adherence to the WHI -DM resulted in better body weight outcomes. Esposito et al. (2004) observed decreased body weight, BMI, and WC in participants consuming a Mediterranean diet compared to those cons uming a control diet over the 2 -year trial. The prospective cohort trials were 5.3, 5.5, and 10 years in duration and all of these s tudies indicated beneficial body weight outcomes when adhering to a healthier dietary pattern or converting to a healthier dietary pattern over time.

Qualitative Assessment of the Body of Evidence Quality and Quantity Although the methodologies and dietary patterns considered in these studies differed, this review included several high-quality, large studies. Four randomized controlled trials 2011; Esposito , , 2011; Rosell , 2006) were included in this review. Six of the seven studies received a positive quali ty rating, and one was rated neutral. The sample sizes for the randomized controlled trials ranged from 140 to 46,808 participants, and the prospective cohort studies had sample sizes of 2,437 to 48,631 participants (in total, 2 studies <200, 2 studies <5, 000, 1 study <25,000, and 2 studies > 45,000). All seven studies were conducted in adults. Consistency Various dietary patterns were considered in this review. Additionally, various measures of body weight status were considered as outcomes. However, overall, there was a general trend for the dietary patterns to be categorized as plant -based patterns, emphasizing vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, with lesser emphasis on meat. There was also a general trend that adherence to a plant -based dietary pattern was associated with better weight outcomes, either greater weight loss or less weight gain, over time compared to controls. Impact Few studies provided quantitative intake data on the food groups consumed within these patterns. For example, for vege tables and fruits, the WHI, DASH, and Mediterranean diet studies recommended at least 5 servings, 9 -12 servings, and a minimum of approximately 1.5 servings (converting from grams) per day, respectively. The WHI reported the intervention group maintained 5 servings at the end of the 2 -year study and the Mediterranean diet trial Dietary Patterns 73 achieved approximately 2 -4 servings per day. While more research is needed, to quantify the amount of food groups that should be consumed, it appears that at least several servings p er day should be emphasized. However, it should be noted that in the prospective cohort studies by Pachucki et al. (2011) and Rosell et al. (2006), movement to a healthier dietary pattern over time was associated with better body weight outcomes. Generali zability/External Validity All of the studies cited were conducted in middle- aged or older adults, with a predominance of women participants. Although one study had a substantial portion of African Americans, the remaining studies were predominantly Cauca sian or conducted in Europe (presumed predominantly Caucasian). Subsequently, the conclusion for this review is limited to adults only, and additional research should be conducted to examine if and how gender and ethnicity might influence the relationship between dietary patterns and body weight status. Limitations Five of the seven studies included in this review assessed dietary intake using FFQs. Additionally, one study assessed dietary patterns by using a simple series of questions. These dietary assessment methodologies have measurement error and also prevent su fficient quantification of dietary intake. The studies did not consistently consider or report calorie intake and/or energy expenditure, which are important to consider when examining body weight status. Dietary Patterns 74 Table 4- A-IV-2.

Body Weight: Intervention group lost weight in the first year (mean of 2.2 kg, P< 0.001) and maintained lower weight than control w omen during an average 7.5 y of follow -up (difference at 1 y = 1.9 kg, P< 0.001 and at 7.5 y = 0.4 kg, P=0.01). No tendency toward weight gain was observed in intervention group women overall or when stratified by age, ethnicity, or body mass index. Weight loss was greatest among women in either group who decreased their percentage of energy from fat (P for trend < 0.001 in both groups in models adjusting for baseline energy intake). A similar but lesser trend was observed with increases in vegetable and fruit servings (P for trend = 0.005 and 0.02 for intervention and control, respectively, in models adjusting for baseline energy intake), and a nonsignificant trend toward weight loss occurred with increasing intake of fiber.

Study included two arms with t he DASH pattern: (1) isocaloric (DASH -A) and (2) caloric restriction of 500 kcal/d (DASH -DM). Body Weight: At follow -up, the mean weight for the DASH -WM group was significantly lower (84.5 kg) compared to DASH -A (92.9 kg; P<0.001) and to controls (94.1 kg; P<0.001). The weight change was 8.7 kg in DASH -WM, 0.3 kg in DASH -A, and +0.9 kg in controls. Percent Body Fat: DASH -WM group had significantly lower % body fat (33.1%) and trunk fat (13.6 kg) compared to DASH -A (36.2%; 16.6 kg) and controls (36.9%; 17.1 kg) (all P-values < 0.001) . DASH -WM had lower lean body mass (54.3 kg) compared to the DASH -A (56.8 kg) and controls (56.5 kg) (all P -values <0.001) . DASH -A did not differ significantly from controls on any body composition measure.

Dietary Patterns 77 Research Recommendations Additional research is needed to specify dietary patterns, particularly the quantity of different food and beverages that should be consumed. Studies, particularly randomized controlled trials, are needed that include several dietary patterns so that dietary patterns can be compared within, in addition to between, studies to determine the optimal dietary pattern, or the consistent components across dietary patterns, that are most beneficial related to body weight status.

(Yes/No)' 'Do you eat any eggs? (Yes/No)' 'Do you eat any dairy products (including milk, cheese, butter, yogurt)? (Yes/No)' Meat -eater (subjects ate meat at baseline and follow -up), fish -eater (subjects did not eat meat but ate fish), vegetarian (subjects did not eat meat or fish but ate eggs and/or dairy products), vegan (subjects did not eat any food of animal origin), reverted (subject s who during follow -up had changed their diet in one or more steps in the direction vegan>vegetarian>fish- eater>meat -eater), or converted (subjects who changed their diet in one or more steps in the opposite direction). Body Weight: Annual weight gain = 0. 39 (0.88) kg in men and 0.40 (0.89) kg in women. Compared with meat -eaters, mean annual weight gain was lower in vegans (0.28 kg in men and 0.30 kg in women, P< 0.05 for both sexes) and fish- eaters (0.34 kg, women only, P <0.001). The lowest mean annual weight gains were seen in men and women classified as converted (0.24 kg in men and 0.30 kg in women, P< 0.001 for both sexes), in whom the mean annual weight gain was 40 and 29% smaller, respectively, compared with the mean annual weight gain in meat -eater s. The highest weight gains were seen in men and women classified as reverted, but these values were not significantly different from the mean weight gains in meat -eaters. BMI: Mean age- adjusted annual increases in BMI in meat - eaters, fish- eaters, veget arians , and vegans were 0.12, 0.12, 0.12, and 0.10 kg/m 2 in men (P for heterogeneity = 0.556), and 0.15, 0.12, 0.15, and 0.12 kg/m2 in women (P for heterogeneity = 0.017), respectively.

The Relationship Between Dietary Patterns and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Section I: Index Analysis By Mary M. McGrane and Joan Lyon What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and risk of cardiovascular disease? TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review project was to identify dietary patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Historically, most dietary guidance has been based on research conducted on individual food components or nutri ents. Dietary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between adherence to an a priori score and risk of cardiovascular disease. An a priori score measures the degree of adherence to specific dietary guidelines or adherence to a healthy diet defined by scientific evidence on diet and disease. A priori scores are composite numeric scores of foods, food components, and/or nutrients that are assessed as dichotomous variables (with predefined cut -points), ordinal variables such as quintiles, or as continuous variables. The individual components are summed to derive a total score. Conclusion Statement There is strong and consistent evidence that in healthy adults increased adherence to dietary patterns scoring high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated oils, low -fat dai ry, poultry and fish; low in red and processed meat, high -fat dairy, and added sugars; and moderate in alcohol is associated with decreased risk of fatal and non -fatal cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and stroke. (Grade I: Strong) Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts) , and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns (using an a priori index or score) and risk of cardiovascular disease. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the review: randomized controlled trials, non -randomized controlled trials, or prospective cohort studies; subjects aged 2 to 18 years; subjects w ho were healthy or at elevated chronic disease risk; subjects from countries with high or very high human development (2011 Human Development Index); and published in English in peer -reviewed journals. The date range was unlimited. Diet exposure was assess ed by adherence to a hypothesis -based dietary pattern, defined using a numerical scoring system. A group of technical experts were involved in a qualitative synthesis of the body of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the s trength of the evidence (grade) using pre -established criteria including evaluation of the quality, quantity, consistency, magnitude of effect , and generalizability of available evidence. Findings A total of 55 studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review and the body of evidenc e consisted Dietary Patterns 80 primarily of large prospective cohort studies. These studies had large, relatively homogeneous populations of generally healthy adults, with long follow -up times. The majority of studies that assessed CVD incidence or mortality reported a favorable association between increased adherence to a dietary pattern and risk of CVD. The decreas e in risk of CVD ranged from 22 to 59 percent for increased adherence to a Mediterran ean dietary pattern and from 20 to 44 percent for increased adherence to a dietary guidelines -related pattern. In studies that examined CVD mortality secondary to total mortality, there were mixed results for favorable and null associations. The majority of studies that assessed CHD inci dence or mortality reported a favorable association between adherence to a dietary pattern and CHD risk. The decreased risk of CHD ranged from 29 to 61 percent for increased adherence to a Mediterran ean dietary pattern, from 24 to 31 percent for increased adherence to a dietary guidelin es-related pattern, and from 14 to 27 percent for adherence to DASH. The majority of studies that assessed stroke incidence or mortality reported a favorable association between adherence to a dietary pattern and stroke risk . The decreased risk of stroke ranged from 13 to 53 percent for increased adherence to a Mediterran ean dietary pattern and from 14 to 60 percent for increased adherence to a dietary guidelines -related pattern. A smaller number of studies examined intermed iate, secondary outcomes , and other individual clinical endpoint outcomes with mixed results. Discussion The preponderance of evidence from studies carried out in large, well -characterized prospective cohorts from the United States , Europe, Japan, and Australia showed that an increase in a Mediterranean diet score or dietary guidelines -related score was associated with decreased risk of fatal and non -fatal CVD, defined as coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as decreased risk of CHD and stroke as individual clinical outcomes. Scores that were most frequently associated with decreased risk of CVD, CHD, or stroke were the original Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed), the Healthy Eat ing Index (HEI)- 2005, the Alternate HEI (AHEI) and updated AHEI- 2010, the Recommended Food Score (RFS), and a DASH score. Positive food components of scores that were associated with decreased CVD risk were fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated fats, and fish. Alcohol was included as a positive component when consumed in mode ration, but not in all scores. Red and processed meats were negative components in the Mediterranean scores, AHEI scores, and DASH; whereas, poultry was included as a positive component in the original AHEI and RFS scores. Total high -fat dairy was a negative component in the MDS, but dairy was a positive component when meeting recommended intakes for the HEI -2005 or as low -fat dairy in the RFS and DASH scores. Cert ain scores also included sugars or sugar -sweetened beverages as negative components. Limitations in this body of evidence were the use of different scores and differences between scores based on median population intak es versus recommended intakes. Howev er, in this relatively large body of evidence, a limited number of scores were predictive of risk , oftentimes less complicated versions of these scores, and in some studies different scores were tested in the same cohorts, making comparisons across these s cores feasible. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Is adherence to dietary guidelines or specific dietary patterns, assessed by a predetermined score, related to the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease? In the past, researchers looked at the relationship between individual foods and nutrients and health. Today, there is interest in looking at how combinations of foods and beverages, or dietary patterns, impact health. Many researchers use a score to measu re how well individuals follow specific dietary guidance or a healthy diet. These are numeric scores of foods, food components, and/or nutrients and the individual components are summed to Dietary Patterns 81 derive a total score for a dietary pattern. This summary of a NEL r eview presents what we know about dietary patterns, assessed using a score, and the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease. Conclusion There is strong and consistent evidence that in healthy adults increased adherence to dietary patterns scoring high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated oils, low -fat dairy, poultry and fish; low in red and processed meat, high -fat dairy, and added sugars; and moderate in alcohol is associated with decreased risk of fatal and non -fatal cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and stroke. What the Research Says Results from this review tell us that consuming a Mediterranean -style dietary pattern or dietary guidelines - related pattern may prevent people from getting cardiovascular diseases. These studies show that consuming a diet that scores high in fruits, veget ables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated oils, low -fat dairy, poultry and fish; low in red and processed meat, high -fat dairy, and added sugars; and moderate in alcohol may decrease risk of fatal and non -fatal cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and stroke. EVIDENCE PORTFOLIO Conclusion Statement There is strong and consistent evidence that in healthy adults increased adherence to dietary patterns scoring high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated oils, low -fat dairy, poultry and fish; low in red and processed meat, high -fat dairy, and added sugars; and moderate in alcohol is associated with decreased risk of fatal and non -fatal cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and stroke. Grade I - Strong Key Findings: Three major categories of dietary pattern scores were identified related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk: dietary exposure based on adherence to ( 1) a Mediterranean dietary pattern, ( 2) dietary guidelines recommendati ons, or ( 3) a DASH diet. The preponderance of the evidence from studies carried out in large, well -characterized prospective cohorts from the United States , Europe, Japan, and Australia showed that, in healthy adults, an increase in a Mediterranean diet score or dietary guidelines -related score was associated with decreased risk of fatal and non - fatal CVD, defined as coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as decreased risk of CHD and stroke as individual clinical outcomes. Fewer studies assessed the association between adherence to a DASH diet and CVD, CHD, or stroke outcomes, using an index or score, and their findings were inconsistent. Scores that were most frequently associated with decreased risk of CVD, CHD, or stroke, in categorical compa risons of adherence, were the original Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed), the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) -2005, the Alternate HEI (AHEI) and updated AHEI -2010, the Recommended Food Score (RFS), and one of the DASH scores. Positive food components of scores that were associated with decreased CVD risk were fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated fats, and fish. Alcohol was included as a positive component when consumed in mode ration, but not in all scores. Red and processed meats were negative components in the Mediterranean scores, AHEI scores, and DASH; whereas, poultry was included as a positive component in the original AHEI and RFS scores. Total high -fat dairy was a negative component in t he MDS, but dairy was a positive component when meeting recommended intakes for the HEI -2005 or as low -fat dairy in the RFS and DASH scores. Certain scores also included sugars or sugar -sweetened beverages as negative components. Dietary Patterns 82 Studies that assessed the association between individual food components of scores and CVD risk were consistent with the identified food components from comparisons across predictive scores. A smaller number of studies examined intermediate, secondary outcomes and other individual clinical endpoints outcomes with mixed results. Evidence Summary Overview Description of the Evidence A total of 55 studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review on dietary patterns and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. The body of evidence consisted primarily of prospective cohort studies; 52 studies were prospective cohort s tudies and the remaining studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs ). In terms of study quality, 46 of the studies were of positive quality and 9 were of neutral qual ity. The studies were carried out between the years 2000 and 2013. The sample sizes o f the RCTs were from 187 to 7,447 subjects. The sample sizes of prospective cohort studies ranged from 373 to as many as 380,296 participants ( 3 studies <1,000, 16 studies >1,000, 29 studies >10,000, and 4 studies >100,000). RCT duration ranged from 3 mont hs to 4.8 years and prospective cohort study follow -up times ranged from 2 to 40 years. Several of the prospective cohort studies were of long duration, with 7 studies with greater than 20 years follow -up. The majority of these studies measured hard clinic al endpoint outcomes. Population: The prospective cohort studies were primary prevention studies of general populations and most studies were conducted with healthy adults who were free of CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension (HTN), or diabetes. However, a few studies included participants with chronic diseases such as CVD, HTN, or diabetes, within a larger cohort of three RCTs were conducted in adults with elevated chronic disease risk: two studies reported on the Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea (PREDIMED) trial of older adults at CVD risks ( Estruch , 2006 and 2013 ) and one study reported on men with metabolic syndrome ( Jacobs , 2009) . In prospective cohort studies with adult participants, age ranges spanned from 18 to 97 years. Two studies focused on young adults with an age range of 18 to 30 years from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA) cohort (Steffen , 2005; Zamora , 2011) . One study was conducted specifically in the elderly with an age range of 70 to 90 years (Knoops , 2004) . Only one study examined children; a longitudinal growth and health study examined boys and girls with a mean age of 13 years at baseline ( van der Laar , 2012) . Several ) and one study focused specifically on post -menopausal women (Belin , 2011) . Other studies stud ies that examined men and women assessed health outcomes separately by von Ruesten, 2010) . Only four studies specifically identified the race/ethnic subgroups of their cohort. Two studies with the CARDIA cohort examined equal numbers of Black and White young adults ( Steffen , 2005; Zamora , 2010 ). One study exami ned Hispanic, Black, and White urban Americans (the Northern Manhattan Study) ( Gardener , 2011) and one study examined Whites, Bl acks, and South Asians in the United Kingdom (Whitehall II study) ( Akbaraly , 2011) . Taken together, studies were conducted in the U nited States , Europe, Japan, and Australia and included many large, well-characterized cohorts. Several studies analyzed the same cohorts; however, all of the included studies presented unique data related to the association between dietary patterns a nd CVD. Nineteen studies were conducted in the United States with the following cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study (Chiuve , 2011 and and 2009; McCullough, 2000b and 20002 2012; McCullough , 2000a Health Study (Folsom , 2007) , the Framingham Offspring and Spouse Study ( Rumawas , 2009) , the NIH Study ( Mitrou , 2007) , the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II ( Seymour , 2003) , the Breast Cancer Detection and Demonstration Project ( Kant , 2000 ), and the Northern Manhattan Study (Gardener , 2011) . Dietary Patterns 83 Nine studies were conducted in Spain with the following cohorts: the Seguimiento Universidad Study ( Estruch , 2006 and 2013) . Eight studies were conducted in Sweden with the following cohorts: the Swedish Mammography Adult Men (Sj\u00f6gren, 2010) , and the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Cohort ( Drake , 2012) . Four studies were conducted in Greece with EPIC -Greece , 2008 ). Two studies were conducted in Italy, EPIC -Italy (Agnoli , 2011) and the Italian Rural Areas of the Seven Countries Study ( Menotti, 2012) . Two studies were conducted in France, the cohort (Dauchet , 2007; Kesse -Guyot , 2011 ). Two studies were conducted in Norway, the Oslo Diet and Exercise Study (Jacobs , 2009) and the Tromso Study ( Hansen -Krone , 2012 ). Two studies conducted in the Netherlands, EPIC -Netherlands (Hoevenaar -Blom , 2012) and the Amsterdam Growth and Health Longitudinal Study ( van der Laar , 2012) . And two studies were conducted in Japan, including the National Integrated Project for Prospective Observation of Non -Communicable Diseases and Trends in the Aged ( Nakamura , 2009) and the Takayama Study ( Oba, 2009) . The remaining countries were represented in only one study: Germany ( EPIC -Potsdam; von Ruesten, , Australia (Blue Mountain Eye Study; Russell , 2012) . Lastly, two large multi -country studies were included in this body of evidence: the Seven Countries Study (United States , Finland, Italy, Greece, Japan, Yugoslavia, and Serbia) ( Fidanza, 2004) and Healthy Ageing: a Longitudinal study in Europe (HALE), comprised of individuals from the Survey in Europe on Nutrition and the Elderly: a Concerned Action (SENECA) and the Finland, Italy, the Netherlands Elderly (FINE) studies. In combination, the latter analysis included 11 European countries ( Knoops , 2004) . Dietary Exposure: Methodologically, diet exposure was assessed by adherence to a hypothesis -driven dietary pattern, defined using a numerical scoring system. Three major categories of a priori dietary patterns were identified: (1) dietary pattern exposure based on a Mediterranean diet, ( 2) dietary pattern exposure based on dietary guidelines recommendations, and ( 3) dietary pattern exposure based on a DASH diet. The most common method of assess ment of dietary intake for determining dietary pattern scores was food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), commonly validated for foods in the respective locations of the population of study. Many prospective cohort studies assessed dietary intake only at bas eline. Twenty -three studies examined health outcomes related t o adherence to a Mediterranean -style dietary pattern. Of these studies, 12 studies used the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) 1 Diet Score (aMed) ( Fung, RCTs used the authors' Mediterranean diet score based on a version of the MDS that assessed a cardio -protective Mediterranean diet ( Estruch , 2006 and 2013 ). Numerous other Mediterranean diet scores were represented in this body of evidence including the relative Mediterranean diet score (rMED) (Buckland , 2009 Fidanza, 2004; Menotti, 2012) , Index ( Agnoli , 2011) . Seventeen studies examined health outcomes related to adherence to dietary guidelines recommend ations, including the United States , French, German, Swedish, and Japanese dietary guidelines recommendations. Of these studies, the largest number of studies assessed adherence to a version of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI). Four studies used the alternat e HEI (AHEI) or updated 2011; Chiuve , 2012) and two studies used HEI-f, a version of the original HEI adapted to the authors' FFQs ( McCullough, 2000a and 2000b) . Several studies used the Recommended Food Score (RFS) in different versions, also including a non -RFS in some studies (Kalu za, - Dietary Patterns 84 RFS] ). Different versions of a Diet Quality Index (DQI) were used including the DQI -2005 (Zamora , 2011 ), the DQI of Patterson ( Seymour , 2003) , and DQI -Swedish Nutrition Recommendations (DQI -SNR) (Drake , 2012 ). Two studies used a Japanese score including the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top ( Oba, 2009) and the Reduced Salt Japanese Diet Score ( Nakamura , 2009) . Lastly, one study used the French Programme National Nutrition Sant\u00e9 Guideline Score (PNNS -GS) (Kesse -Guyot , 2011 ) and one study used the German Food Pyramid (von Reusten, 2010) . Eight studies examined health outcomes related to adherence to a DASH diet. Of these studies, five studies used the DASH score of Fung ( and ( , 2007; Levitan , 2009a ). One study (Dauchet, 2007) used two scores adapted from the DASH eating plan of Appel (Appel , 1997) and one study (Camoes, 2010) used the DASH goals of Sacks (Sacks , 1995 and 2001) . Finally, one study (Levitan, 2009a) used DASH scores based on NHLBI food and nutrient recommendations. Five studies examined health outcomes comparing the association with two or more dietary pattern scores, including comparisons across Mediterranean, dietary guidelines, DASH, and other customized scores ( Agnoli , 2011 ; and Toledo , 2010 [ DASH, UMMDS, etc .]). Toledo, in particular, assessed a large number of scores across Mediterranean diet and dietary guidelines -related scores. Three studies measured different versions of related scores (Chiuve , 2012 [ studies examined health outcomes associated with the authors' own a priori diet scores: Hansen -Krone and Steffen (2005) . Qualitative Synthesis of the Collected Evidence Themes and Key Findings for Total Scores Health Outcomes: The studies in this body of evidence were subdivided into two broad categories based on ( I) endpoint clinical outcomes and ( II) intermediate (CVD risk factor) outcomes. Within the first category, there were five designated subcategories: studies that exam ined (1) cardiovascular disease (CVD), ( 2) coronary heart disease (CHD), (3) stroke, ( 4) myocardial infarction (MI), and ( 5) heart failure (HF). Within the second category, there were two designated subcategories: studies that examined ( 1) hypertension (HT N) and blood pressure (BP) and ( 2) blood lipids. Endpoint Clinical Outcomes: Cardiovascular diseases are disorders, both fatal and non -fatal, that affect the heart and circulatory system. The two major subclasses of CVD are CHD and st roke, and CHD includes MI as a major event. In addition, HF, another prevalent disorder, is also included within CVD. For this systematic review, endpoint clinical outcomes were subdivided into CVD, CHD, stroke, MI, and HF; ranging from more inclusive to less inclusive cardiovascular disorders. Overall, the outcomes were most commonly identified using the 9th or 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD -9 or ICD -10). CVD Incidence and Mortality : The CVD category included studies that assessed a composite measure of CVD as the primary or secondary outcome of the study, and ove rall 29 studies were included (t able 4-B-I-2). Typically, studies that measured CVD as a primary outcome did not include all diseases of the circulatory system (i.e., the entire spectrum of disorders listed in the ICD for this category). Total CVD most commonly included CHD and stroke, both fatal and nonfatal events. CHD and stroke events, in addition to CVD, were also assessed individually in many of these studies. This categ ory also included studies with the primary objective of assessing total mortality but that also assessed CVD mortality as a secondary outcome. These studies commonly assessed CVD as \"diseases of the circulatory system\" and included the complete spectrum, o r a large spectrum, of disorders listed in the ICD for this category. Seventeen studies examined the association between adherence to a dietary pattern and CVD incidence and/or mortality as primary outcomes. The studies were all prospective cohort studie s with one exception, an RCT (PREDIMED trial) that reported endpoint clinical outcomes (Estruch , 2013 [ Med Diet ]). The prospective cohort Dietary Patterns 85 studies were typically large studies with well -characterized cohorts representative of national populations from the United States , Europe, and Japan. Two major categories of a priori dietary patterns were identified in these cohorts: (1) Mediterranean -style dietary patterns and ( 2) dietary guidelines -related dietary patterns. Additionally, two studies examined adherence to a DASH dietary pattern and three studies examined adherence to the authors' own a priori dietary pattern score. Out of 17 studies that assessed CVD incidence and mortality, 14 studies reported a favorable association between increased adherence to a dietary pattern and risk of CVD ( ]; Fung, 2009 , Diet Score]; Pangiotakos , 2008 [ MedDietScore] ). These studies had large sample sizes with generally healthy adults and long follow -up times. The long follow -up periods allowed for sufficient numbers of incident events and assessment of long- term associations between a given dietary pattern and CVD risk. The large cohorts in these studies were relatively homogeneous in terms of ethnicity and SES, which had the advantage of reducing confounding. In the prospective cohort studies, with few exceptions, common confounders were adjusted for, including age, sex, total energy, physical activity, BMI, smoking, and medications or supplements. Overall, in s tudies that reported favorable associations between a dietary pattern (based on categories of adherence) and CVD incidence or mortality, the decrease in r isk of CVD ranged from 22 to 59 percent for increased adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and from 20 to 44 percent for increased adherence to a dietary guidelines -related pattern. The one RCT reported that a Mediterranean diet (plus olive oil or nuts) decreased risk of CVD in high risk s ubjects, with an approximate 30 percent decrease in risk of major CVD events for both interventions, and the trial (PREDIMED) was stopped early for meeting benefit requirements ( Estruch, 2013 [Med Diet] ). One study found an association between adherence to a German dietary guidelines -related score in men, but not i n women (von Ruest en 2010 [German Food Pyramid Index] ), and one study of women report ed that although there was a 14 percent decreased risk of CVD, it was not significant (McCullough , 2000b [HEI -f]). Lastly, although one study on DASH cited above found a 12- percent decrease in incident CVD risk in women ( Fitzgerald , 2012 [DASH] ), a second study reported no association between a DASH dietary pattern and CVD mortality in women ( Folsom , 2007 [DASH] ). Twelve studies measured CVD m ortality as a secondary outcome after total mortality. Of these studies, five studies reported a favorable association between adherence to a dietary pattern and CVD mortality ( studies reported different CVD mortality risk outcomes based on gender. Three of these studies found a favorable association between adherence to either a dietary guidelines -related score ( Oba, 2009 [Japan ese Food Guide Score]; Seymour , 2003 [DQI] ) a ( Tognon, 2012 [MMDS] ) and CVD mortality in women, but not men. However, one study found a favorable association in men, but not in women ( Drake , 2012 [DQI -SNR] ). Three studies reported no association between dietary pattern and CVD mortality ( Nilsson , examined only women; three of these foun d a favorable association between dietary pattern and CVD incidence or mortality in women ( Belin , 2011 DMI]; Fitzgerald , 2012 [DASH]; 2009 post -menopausal women [Belin , 2011] ). However, one study, although reporting a 14 percent decreased risk of CVD in women, found it was not significant ( McCullough , 2000b [ HEI-f]). Another study found no association in women ( Folsom , 2007 [DASH] ). Three studies examined only men and found either a favorabl e association [HDI, MDS] ). Other studies examined men and women separately relative to CVD risk and found either a favorable association for both between adherence to a dietar y pattern and CVD ) or a gender difference with a favorable association for men, but not women ( Drake , 2012 [ DQI- [German Food Pyramid Index] ) or a favorable association for women, but not men ( Oba, 2009 [Japanese Food Guide Score]; Seymour , 2003 [DQI]; Tognon, 2012 [MMDS] ). One study that assessed men and women separately found no association for either men or women ( Nilsson , 2012 [Traditional Sami diet score] ). Two studies assessed men and women together, as well as men and women separately, and found a favorable Dietary Patterns 86 association in all cases between adherence to a dietary pattern and CVD mortality ( Buckland AHEI]) . Taken together, although there are reported gender differences across this series of studies, the evidence is mixed and does not demonstrate a consistently more favorable association for men or women as individual subgroups. Many of the studi es that found gender differences used country -specific dietary guidelines scores within their target populations, including the German Food Pyramid Index, the Japanese Food Guide Score, and the DQI adapted to the Swedish Nutrition Recommendations (DQI -SNR) . CHD Incidence and Mortality : CHD was commonly defined as fatal and nonfatal CHD and nonfatal MI. This category included 16 studies that measured CHD incidence or mortality. Nine of these studies assessed diet exposure as adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern; whereas , fewer studies assessed other diet pattern score categories such as dietary guidelines -related scores (4), DASH scores (3), and an authors' customized a priori diet score (1). Overall, the CHD studies included seven of the above st udies that measured both CVD and CHD as independent outcomes, six studies that examined CHD inciden ce or mortality, three studies that measured CHD mortality as a secondary outcome after total mortality, and one study that examined sudden cardiac death (t able 4-B-I-3). Overall, the CHD outcomes were most commonly identified by ICD -9 or ICD -10 codes. Out of 13 studies that assessed CHD as a primary outcome, including n on-fatal and fatal outcomes, 10 studies reported a favorable association between adherence to a dietary pattern and CHD risk ( Buckland ). Similar to the above studies that assessed CVD, these studies had large, relatively homogeneous populations of generally healthy adults, with long follow -up times. Overall, based on categories of adherence, the decreased r isk of CHD ranged from 29 to 61 pe rcent for increased adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, from 24 to 31 percent for increased adherence to a dietary guidelines -related pattern, and from 14 to 27 percent for adherence to DASH. Common confounders that were adjusted for across these studies were age, sex, physical activity, BMI, and smoking. Of the above studies, one study that compared the HEI -2005 with the AHEI -2010 and adjusted each for respective models, found a favorable association between adherence to the AHEI, but not HEI, an d risk of CHD with that further adjustment (Chiuve , 2012 [HEI, AHEI]) . For CHD, the AHEI -2010 was more strongly associated with risk than the HEI-2005 (P -difference = 0.002). Three studies reported no association between adherence to a dietary pattern and risk of CHD ( Fitzgerald , 2012 [ DASH ]; Folsom , DASH ]; Osler 2002 [Healthy Food Index] ). In studies that examined CHD mortality secondary to total mortality, all three studies found a favorable association between dietary pattern adherence and CHD mort ality, ranging from 33 to 53 percent decreased risk ( Kant , Sub- analysis -Gender: Several studies examined only women. Five studies found a favorable association between dietary pattern and CHD incidence and mortality in women ( Chiuve , 2011 [aMed] and Wolk, 2002 [RFS] ); whereas, t wo studies found no association in women (Fitzgerald , 2012 [DASH ]; Folsom , 2007 [DASH] ). Two studies examined only men and found a favorable association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and CHD risk in men ( Fidanza, 2004 [MAI]; Menotti, 2012 [MAI]) . Three studies assessed men and women together, as well as men and women separately, and found a favorable association in all cases between adherence to a dietary pattern and CHD mortality ( Buckland AHEI]) . Taken together, the studies that assessed CHD risk in men and women separately did not show gender differences, although two studies that only examined women found no association between a DASH dietary pattern and CHD. Stroke: This category included 10 studies that examined stroke in addition to CVD or CHD (above), or stroke alone. In addition, three studies measured stroke mortality as a secondary outcome after total mortality. The studies were all prospective cohort st udies with one exception, an RCT (PREDIMED) that outcomes (Estruch ). Stroke outcomes often included ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, in some cases results were reported as total stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemor rhagic stroke ( table 4-B-I-4). Out of 13 studies that Dietary Patterns 87 assessed stroke, including non -fatal and fatal outcomes, 10 studies reported a favorable association between adherence to a dietary pattern and stroke risk ( , 2009 [ Japanese Diet Score] ). Similar to the above studies that assessed CVD, these studies had large sample sizes with generally healthy adults and long follow -up times with relatively homogeneous populations. Overall, the decreased risk of stroke ranged from 13 to 53 percent for increased adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and from 14 to 60 percent for increased adherence to a dietary guidelines -related pattern. One stu dy on the DASH diet showed a 17 percent decreased risk of stroke in women with increased adherence to the DASH score of Fung. Common confound ers that were adjusted for across these studies were age, sex, total energy, physical activity, BMI, and smoking. The one RCT reported that a Mediterranean diet (plus olive oil or nuts) decreased risk of stroke in high risk subjects ( Estruch , 2013 [Med Die t]). Two of the studies found differing results based on a comparison between two or more dietary pattern scores. One study found the AHEI -2010 was more predictive of stroke than HEI -2005 (Chiuve , 2012 [HEI, AHEI]) . A second study compared four different s cores and found that two Mediterranean diet scores (MDS and Italian MDS) and the DASH score of Fung were predictive of total st roke risk, but HEI -2005 was HEI] one study reported no association between d ietary pattern adherence and risk of ischemic stroke (Gardener , 2011 [MDS] ) and two studies reported no association with stroke death ( Folsom , 2007 [ DASH ]; Tognon, 2012 Sub- analysis -Gender: Several studies examined only women; four of these found a favorable association between dietary pattern and stroke incidence or mortality in women ( Fung, 2008 [DASH ]; Fung, 2009 [ but no association ( Folsom , 2007 [DASH] ). None of the studies examined stroke risk only in men. One study assessed men and women separately and found no association between a Mediterranean diet and stroke mortality ( Tognon, 2012 [MMDS] ). One study assessed men and women together, as well as men and women separately, and found a favorable association in all cases between adherence to a dietary guidelines -related pattern and stroke incidence (Chiuve , 2012 [ HEI, AHEI] ). Taken together, these studies did not show g ender differences relative to risk of stroke. Myocardial Infarction: This category included four of the above studies that also examined fatal and non -fatal MI as an independent outcome and one study that measured MI mortality as a secondary outcome after total mortality (table 4-B-I-4). Two studies reported a favorable association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and risk of MI ( Gardener ). One study reported a favor able association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and risk of MI mortality in women, but not in men ( Tognon, 2012 [MMDS] ). Two studies found no association between a dietary pattern score and risk of MI ( Hansen- Krone , 2012 [Smart Diet , 2009 [Japanese Diet Score] ). Heart Failure: This category included three studies that measured heart failure as the primary outcome ( table 4-B-I-4). In two of these studies, heart failure included the ICD categories for heart failure and hypertensive heart failure and these studies found a favorable association between adherence to a DASH diet and risk of HF in men and women (Levitan , 2009a and 2009b [DASH] ). The third study found a favorable association between the AHEI and the authors' own Dietary Modification Index (DMI) and risk of HF in the Women's Health Initiative study. Intermediate Outcomes: Hypertension, Blood Pressure, and Blood Lipids The intermediate outcomes and CVD risk factors included in this review were HTN, BP (systolic and diastolic), and blood lipids including LDL -C, HDL -Cl, the total -C: HDL -C and LDL -C: HDL -C ratios, and triglycerides. Relative to the large body of evidence fo r this question, only a few studies examined intermediate outcomes related to CVD risk. Dietary Patterns 88 Hypertension and Blood Pressure: Of the three studies that examined the association between adherence to a dietary pattern and HTN, two studies found no association ( N\u00fa\u00f1ez -C\u00f3rdoba , 2009 [MDS] ) and one study found different results comparing multiple dietary pattern sc ores. Toledo et al. reported a higher DASH score was associated with decreased risk of HTN, but a higher updated, modified MDS (UMMDS) was associated with increased risk of HTN (Toledo, 2010 [DASH and UMMDS] ). Three studies that examined BP as a primary o utcome found an association between increased DASH scores and decreased systolic and diastolic BP (SBP [aMed] ). One of these studies also assessed men and women separately and found a favorable association for SBP in men, but not women ( Dauchet , 2007 [ DASH]). One study also assessed risk of elevated BP (EBP) and found an association between increased DASH score and decreased risk of EBP ( Steffen , 2005 [Food Index] from a subsample of the PREDIMED trial, with subjects at elevated CVD risk, found the Mediterranean diet treatment groups (Med diet + olive oil or + nuts) had improved SBP and DBP measures (Estruch , 2006 [Med the other hand, a se cond RCT that examined men with metabolic syndrome found no effect of a diet that matched adherence to the authors' a priori diet score and changes in SBP and DBP ( Jacobs , 2009 [a priori diet score] ). Three studies examined BP as a component of metabolic syndrome. One study found an association between adherence to a dietary pattern and decreased SBP and DBP (Zamora , 2011 [DQI] ). But two studies reported no association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and BP ( Rumawas Of the three studies that examined blood lipids as primary outcomes, two of these studies were RCTs with populations at elevated risk. An early report from a subsample of the PREDIMED trial, with subjects at elevated CVD risk , found the Mediterranean diet treatment groups had favorable changes in blood HDL -C, the total -Cl: HLD -C ). On the hand, the second RCT, that examined men with metabolic syndrome, found no effect of a diet treatment that matched adherence to the authors' a priori diet score and changes in LDL -C, HDL -C, or triglycerides, although there was a significant d ecrease in total cholesterol in the diet treatment group ( Jacobs , 2009 [a priori diet score] ). The third study in this group was a prospective cohort study that showed a favorable association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and total and HDL -C (van der Laar , 2012 [aMed] ). Three studies examined blood lipids as components of metabolic syndrome. One study found an association between adherence to a dietary pattern and higher HDL -C levels ( Zamora , 2011 [DQI] ), one study reported adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with favorable changes in HDL -C and triglycerides ( Rumawas , 2009 [MSDPS] ), and one study found no association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and blood lipids ( Tortosa , 2007 [MDS]). Themes and Key Findings for Food Components of Scores Food Components of Diet Pattern Scores Twenty studies assessed the association between individual food components of a dietary pattern score and CVD endpoint outcomes ( Index] ). Eight studies used components from Mediterranean diet scores (5 MDS, 1 rMed, 2 Med); four studies used components from DASH diets; six studies used components from dietary guidelines -related scores ( 2 AHEI , 1 AHEI -2010 and HEI -2005, 2 HEI-f, 1 DQI), and three studies used components from the authors' customized diet pattern scores (1 Smart Diet Score, 1 Food Index, 1 Diet Modification Index). Dietary Patterns 89 Fruits, vegetables, and nuts (either individually or in combination as fruits & vegetables or fruits & nuts) were cite d by nine studies as having a protective association with clinical outcomes, including CVD ( Belin, 2011 [AHEI, DMI] [HEIf]; and Seymour , 2003 [ DQI] only in women) ; CHD (Buckland 2009 stroke (Estruch Diet] ). One study specified dark -green and orange vegetables as having a protective association against CHD ( Chiuve , 2012 [HEI, AHEI]) . One study reported on nuts and soy as having a favorable association with risk of CVD ( Akbaraly , 2011 [ AHE I]). Four studies reported a favorable association between fruits, vegetables, and/or nuts and intermediate outcomes or CVD risk factors, including Legumes were reported in two studies as having a favorable association with either decreased risk of stroke ( Whole grains were reported in three studies as having a favorable association with CVD Index] ). Several studies reported a favorable association between olive oil (MUFA) or PUFA consumption and risk of Diet] ). One study reported a favorable association between healthy oils (plant and fish oils) and CHD r isk in women only (Chiuve , 2012 [HEI, AHEI]) . As well, these compone nts were favorably associated with improved BP and blood lipids ( Estruch , 2006 [Med] ). Fish consumption risk of Gardener [Smart Diet] ). The studies that assessed plant oils and fish were predominantly using a Mediterranean diet score, although the HEI -2005 included plant and fish oils in their healthy oils component. Alcohol consumption was reported by seven studies as having a favorable association with risk of CVD ( Akbaraly , [MDS] ). Studies that assessed alcohol used components of either a Mediterranean diet score (3 MDS, 1 rMed) or the AHEI. One study that used the HEI -2005 reported a favorable association between a composite solid fats/alcoholic beverages/added sugars (SoFAAS) component, the benefits of which were driven by alcohol intake ( Chiuve , 2012 [HEI, AHEI]) . Certain food components were also considered for their unfavorable association with risk of CVD. Meat, including red and processed meat, was associated with increased risk o f CVD ( Belin , 2011 [AHEI] ), Index] ). Dairy consumption, on the other hand, was reported both negatively and positively in different studies. One study reported an unfavorable association between to tal dairy and CHD risk ( Buckland , 2009 [rMed]) ; however, two studies reported a favorable association between total dairy and HTN ( Folsom , 2007 [DASH , 2005 [Food Index] ). Components across All Scores and Indices Although the dietary pattern scores that were used in this large body of evidence were numerous, those scores adherence to which was associated with decreased risk of CVD clinical endpoints were many fewer, and can be compared to assess commonalities across them. Scores that were associated with decreased risk of CVD, CHD, stroke, MI, and HF were selected to examine commonalities in components across scores related to clinically significant outcomes, rather than intermediate markers ( table 4-B-I-1 Comparison of Dietary Components across Diet Pattern Scores). The scores include the MDS (18 associated outcomes), aMed (5 associated outcomes), AHEI (7 associated outcomes, 3 AHEI 2010), RFS (6 associated outcomes), HEI -2005 (3 associated outcomes), and DASH (6 associated outcomes). Regarding a DASH score, th e score developed by Fung ( 2008) was associated with CVD endpoints in all six studies; by comparison, the DASH score of Folsom was not significantly associated with CVD, CHD, stroke death, or HTN (Folsom , 2007) or heart failure (Levitan , 2009a). Overall, the above scores were the most commonly applied scores associated with a protective outcome for CVD risk in healthy adults. This relatively small number of dietary pattern scores, that are also uncomplicat ed versions, had similarities in that food Dietary Patterns 90 groups were aligned and described in similar ways, although they were scored differently. Many of these scores have been tested in the same cohort with similar results. Two of the scores assessed adherence to a Mediterranean style diet (MDS, aMed). Although these were a priori , hypothesis -driven scores, they were also population -based in that dichotomous points (0, 1) were assigned to individuals who were above or below the population median. The aMed score was b ased on the original MDS of Trichopolou and modified by excluding potatoes from the vegetable group, separating fruit and nuts into two groups, eliminating the dairy group, including whole -grain products only, including only red and processed meats for the meat group, and assigning alcohol intake of 5 -15 g/d for 1 point (Fung et al. , 2005). The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was developed to measure compliance with U .S. dietary guidance, initially using the 1995 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs) and updat ed for 2005 (and currently 2010, but not utilized in studies reported in this review). In this body of evidence , the updated HEI -2005 was used to assess CVD outcomes, as well as to compare predictive utility with an alternative version, the Alternative HEI (AHEI) (Chiuve , 2012). Additionally, a variation on the original HEI was used by McCullough to assess CVD risk in men and wome n separately (McCullough, 2000a and 2000b). In the studies included here, the HEI and AHEI scores (including updated HEI - 2005 and AHEI -2010) were based on dietary guidance with individuals ranked across a gradient of high to low scores, based on recommended intakes, independent of the population. The AHEI -2010 introduced detailed changes from the original, including the recommendati on of ~ 5 or 6 servings per day of 100% whole -grain products for women and men, respectively, and including long chain n- 3 fats (EPA and DHA) as well as PUFA intake as percent energy as positive components. The DASH score developed by Fung reflected adheren ce to a DASH -style diet and was operationalized based on quintiles of intake of food group and nutrient components, rather than absolute intake. The Recommended Food Score (RFS) of Kant ( 2000) was based on consumption of dietary guidelines - recommended foods assessed by summing individual food items derived from the FFQ tool used in the respective study, with a summary score that added the food items consumed at least once per week. The total RFS scores varied from study to study, as the number of FFQ items varied, although the most commonly used RFS version was the 23 -item version of Kant ( 2000) . Overall, although the Mediterranean, HEI and AHEI, DASH, and RFS score methods differed, they were all employed to address, and successfully predicted, the associat ion between an a priori defined dietary pattern and CVD risk, at the level of endpoint outcomes. It is interesting to note that the AHEI and updated AHE -2010, the aMed score, and the DASH -Fung score have all been tested in women in the Nurses' Health study and were favorably associated with CVD, CHD, and/or stroke risk. Related to this, when the HEI -2005 and AHEI -2010 were compared in both the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow -Up Study, and risk was adjusted for the other respective m odel, the HEI -2005 lost significance in association with CVD, CHD, and stroke risk, whereas the AHEI -2010 did not (Chiuve , 2012). Taken together, the positive components of the scores that were associated with decreased CVD risk were fruits and nuts, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, unsaturated fats, and fish. Alcohol was commonly included as a positive component when consumed in m oderation in all of the scores except for HEI, RFS, and DASH. Meat (red and processed meat) was a negative component in the Mediterranean scores, AHEI scores, and DASH, although the original AHEI emphasized a white/red meat ratio where the white meat inclu ded poultry and fish. The RFS of Kant included chicken or turkey as positive components in their food item -based score. There was variation in the method by which dairy was assessed. Total dairy (high fat) was a negative component in the MDS, was omitted f rom the aMed, but was a positive component when meeting recommended intakes for the HEI -2005 or as low -fat dairy in the RFS and DASH -Fung scores. Certain scores also included sugars (HEI -2005 included sugar in a combined category of solid fats, alcoholic b everages and added sugars [SoFAAS]) or sugar -sweetened beverages (AHEI -2010 included sugar sweetened beverages and fruit juice), as well as trans fats, and sodium as negative components.

Several of the studies that utilized scores that successfully predicted CVD outcomes also assessed food group components. Giv en the scores that are highlighted in t able 1, component analysis was done for the MDS, HEI -2005, AHEI, AHEI -2010, and DASH -Fung. For MDS, in the SUN cohort, Martinez -Gonzalez found that only the fruits & nuts group was favorably as sociated with incidence of CVD ( Martinez -Gonzalez , 2011 [MDS] ). However, when the MDS was tested in the EPIC -Netherlands cohort, the association of t he MDS with CVD and MI was attenuated most when alcohol was excluded from the score, and alcohol was operationalized differently from the original MDS in that alcohol intake was dichotomized into users and non- users (1 point for 1 [MDS] ). In one study that examined cerebrovascular disease, the food groups that had an inverse association were vegetables, legumes, and monounsaturated fats in the EPIC- Greece cohort (Misirli, 2012 [MDS] ). HEI-2005 : For the HEI- 2005, dark -green and orange vegetables, whole grains, and energy from solid fat, alcohol, and added sugar were significantly associated with lower risk of CHD ( Chiuve, 2012 [HEI, AHEI] ). The inverse association for the solid fat, alcohol, and added sugar component was driven by alcohol intake. Vegetable oils were associated with risk of CHD among women only. AHEI: For AHEI, in individual AHEI component analyses, fruits, the white/red meat ratio, trans fat, multivitamin use , and alcohol consumption were each associated with decreased CVD ( Belin , : For the AHEI- 2010, whole grains and alcoholic beverages were inversely associated, and red and processed meats were positively associated with risk of CHD ( Chiuve, 2012 [HEI, AHEI]) . DASH: For the DASH -Fung score, comparing highest to lowest quintiles of score, the fruit component was associated with decreased risk of CVD ( Fitzgerald, 2011 [DASH] ).

Validity was assessed by examining the scientific soundness of study design and execution to avoid potential bias in the findings related to outcomes; this included selection, performance, attrition, detection, and reporting bias. For this body of evidence, the preponderance of the evidence consisted of positive quality studies (45 out of 55 studies), indicating a low risk of bias overall. This was a relatively large body of evidence with studies that directly addressed the question. The majority of these studies were prospective cohort studies with large numbers of participants in nationally recognized cohorts. Consistency CVD Incidence a nd Mortality : The evidence of a protective association between a dietary pattern score and risk of CVD was consistent in the majority of studies that used either a Mediterranean diet score or dietary guidelines index in healthy adult populations. The body of evidence f or CVD endpoint clinical outcomes was relatively large (29 studies), with many fewer studies on intermediate outcomes. Typically, studies that measured CVD as a primary outcome did not include all diseases of the circulatory system (i.e., studies did not include the entire spectrum of ICD disorders for this category). Total CVD most commonly included CHD and stroke, both fatal and nonfatal events. These studies were consistent in finding a decreased risk of CVD associated with adherence to either a Mediterr anean diet or dietary guidelines -related pattern. Out of 17 studies, 15 studies reported a favorable association. This included studies in the United States (9 studies), Spain (2 studies), France, the Netherlands, Greece, Japan, and the 11 European countri es of the HALE study. All of these studies measured a composite fatal and non -fatal CVD, with the exception of two studies that assessed CVD mortality alone. The one RCT reported that a Mediterranean diet decreased risk of CVD in high risk subjects, and the trial (PREDIMED) was stopped early for meeting benefit requirements. This category also included studies with the primary objective of assessing total mortality, but that also assessed cause -specific mortality including CVD. These studies commonly assess ed CVD as a larger composite category than the above studies, most often described as \"diseases of the circulatory system\" and including the complete spectrum, or a large spectrum, of ICD disorders for the category. These studies were less consistent, and this may relate to the larger number of cardiovascular diseases included in the CVD outcome. Out of twelve studies, five reported a favorable association, four reported different risk outcomes based on gender, and three found no association. CHD Incidence and Mortality: The evidence of a protective association between a dietary pattern score and risk of CHD was consistent in the majority of studies in healthy adult populations. Most of the studies assessed adherence to a Mediterranean diet, with fewer studi es that assessed dietary guidelines -related or DASH scores. The body of evidence for CHD endpoint clinical outcomes was also relatively large. Out of 16 studies t hat assessed CHD, including non fatal and fatal outcomes, nine studies reported a favorable ass ociation between adherence to a dietary pattern and CHD risk, one study found a favorable association between adherence to the AHEI, but not HEI, and three studies reported no association. In studies that examined CHD mortality secondary to total mortality , all three studies found a favorable association between dietary pattern adherence and CHD mortality. Similar to the studies on CVD, the prospective cohort studies were conducted in the United States and several European countries with large, well -characterized cohorts. Stroke: The evidence of a protective association between a dietary pattern score and risk of stroke was consistent in the majority of studies in healthy adult populations. Out of 13 st udies that assessed stroke, including nonfatal and fatal outcomes, 10 studies reported a favorable association. This included one RCT, the above -mentioned PREDIMED trial. Two studies that compared different dietary pattern scores found a favorable associat ion between one or more scores and stroke risk and one study reported no association. Myocardial Infarction: The evidence of a protective association between a dietary pattern score and risk of MI was inconsistent and included fewer studies than the above health outcomes. Out of six studies, two studies reported a favorable association between dietary pattern and MI risk, one study reported different risk outcomes based on gender, two studies found no association, and one study found a favorable association with one score, but an unfavorable association with a second score. Dietary Patterns 94 Heart Failure: The three studies that examined heart failure were consistent in showing a favorable association between adherence to a dietary pattern and risk of heart failure; two of these studies included the ICD categories for heart failure and hypertensive heart failure. Impact This body of evidence directly addressed the exposures and health outcomes of interest for this systematic review, with a large number of studies measuring endpoint clinical outcomes. Overall, several large prospective cohort studies found a decreased risk of CVD, CHD, stroke, or heart failure associated with adherence to a Mediterranean diet or dietary guidelines score. Although not clinical trials, these cohort studies reported results that are applicable in free -living populations. For example, a recent study from the Nurses' Health and Health Professionals Follow -up cohorts reported that a change from lowest to highest AHEI adherence reduced ris k of CVD, CHD, and stroke by 20, 31, and 14 percent , respectively, over 24 years ( Chuive , 2012 (HEI, AHEI)) . It is notable that in this study dietary intake was assessed at regular intervals over the long follow -up period. Additionally, although there were only a few clinical trials in this body of evidence, the PREDIMED study reported that a Mediterranean diet (pl us olive oil or nuts) decreased risk of clinical endpoint outcomes, CVD and stroke, in high risk subjects and, as already indicated, this trial was stopped early for meeting benefit requirements. Generalizability/External Validity Studies were conducted in the U nited States , Europe, Japan, and Australia and included many large, well - characterized cohorts. Nineteen studies were conducted in the United States and the remaining studies were conducted mainly in Europe, with Spain, Sweden, and Greece heavily represented. In addition, two studies were conducted in Japan and one in Australia. Taken together, the prospective cohort studies were primary prevention studies of general populations and most studies were conducted with healthy adults. Subgroup analysis was conducted in many studies on men and women; however, there were no consistent differences between men and women in the association between dietary pattern and CVD outcomes. There were only a few studies that specifically identified and analyzed race/ethnic subgroups of their cohorts and none reported differences based on race or ethnicity. Overall, therefore, there is a relatively large body of evidence o n adherence to dietary patterns in the United States and European populations of healthy adults. This is primarily among Caucasian populations, however, with little additional analysis of racial or ethnic subpopulations. Given the robust evidence involving U.S. cohorts and endpoint clinical outcomes, the generalizability to the U .S. population, and relevance of this body of evidence to U .S. policy on dietary patterns and risk of CVD, is compelling. Limitations of the Evidence Common limitations of studies on dietary patterns using a priori scores involve the use of different scores, differences between scores that are based on median population intakes versus indices that are based on recommended intakes, scores that use similar weights for each component assuming equivalent effects on health, the use of different confounding factors (or lack of sufficient adjustment), and problems associated with use of different FFQs and validation related to other methods of diet assessment. It should be said, however, that in this relatively large body of evidence, a limited number of scores were used, oftentimes less complicated versions of these scores, and in a number of cases the different scores were tested in the same cohorts. Overall, this makes the comparison of food components across these scores feasible. Additionally, a very common limitation in many prospective cohort studies is that dietary intake is based on a single dietary assessment at baseline, with no follow -up assessment of dietary intake over the period of the study. However, this body of evidence had notable exceptions including Chiuve (2010 [aMed/NHS] and 2011 [ HEI, AHEI/NHS, HPFS ]), and Fung (2008 [DASH/NHS] and 2009 [aMed/NHS ]) that measured dietary intakes at regular intervals across the period of follow -up of the respective studies. Therefore, these studies did take into account the fact that diets change over time due to trends in the food supply, as well as the fact that po pulation -level and individual -level food choices change over time. Dietary Patterns 95 Research Recommendations The studies covered in this systematic review provide results that improve some of the problems involved in dietary patterns research. For example, the need for consensus on a single score or index that is applicable across populations is less problematic in this body of evidence than for some other outcomes, as a relatively small number of uncomplicated scores have been used to successfully predict CVD risk in l arge U .S. and European populations. Further quantitative analysis/comparisons of these scores and their respective components by meta -analysis would be particularly useful. Although a large number of the studies assessed food group components and their ass ociation with CVD outcomes, many did not, and more precise determination of the benefits and risks of individual components ( e.g., alcohol) would be helpful for policy recommendations. In addition, component analysis could be improved by determining intera ction terms across components that would be needed to maintain a dietary patterns approach. Methodologically, research in this area could be improved by measuring dietary intake at regular intervals over the course of a prospective study, rather than just at baseline (although a few of the large cohort studies in this body of evidence did this). Determining the best approach to weighing and scoring individual food components would also improve the rigor in application of scores to assess dietary pattern adh erence. Additionally, studies in this body of evidence that assessed gender differences in the relationship between adherence to a dietary pattern and CVD risk found inconsistent results. Further research is needed to clarify this. There were also very few studies that identified racial/ethnic subgroups within their cohorts and analyzed these groups separately related to CVD risk and this warrants additional research. Assessment of dietary patterns at earlier and later stages of the l ife cycle is also recom mended. Lastly, behavioral issues related to timing, frequency, and size of meals need further consideration.

Spahn, and Joan Lyon Are prevailing patterns of diet behavior in a population, assessed using factor or cluster analysis, related to risk of cardiovascular disease? TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review project is to identify patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Historically, most dietary guidance has been based on research conducted on individual food components or nutrients. Die tary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, varieties, or combinations of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Factor and cluster analysis allow examinati on of the relationship between prevailing dietary patterns of a population and outcomes of public health concern. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between patterns of food and beverage intake, identified using factor and cluster analysis, and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Conclusion Statement Limited evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that dietary patterns, assessed using cluster or factor analysis, characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low -fat dairy products are associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease in adults. Evidence of a relationship between dietary patterns characterized by red and processed meat, s ugar-sweetened foods and drink s, and fried foods and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease is limited and less consistent.

Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts), and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns defined using factor or cluster analysis and CVD risk. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the revie w: Human sub jects; Ages: 2 years and older; Populations: Healthy and those with elevated chronic disease risk; subjects from countries with high or very high human development (based on the 2011 Human Development Index); randomized controlled trials, non -randomized c ontrolled trials, or quasi- experimental studies; Sample size: Minimum of 30 subjects per study arm; Dropout rate less than 20 percent ; Study assesses dietary intake using factor and cluster analysis; study considered cardiovascular disease and risks of car diovascular disease; published in English in a peer -reviewed journal. The date range for the conduct of studies was unlimited. The results of each included study were summarized on evidence worksheets (including a study quality rating) and evidence table. A group of subject matter experts were involved in a qualitative synthesis of the body of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the strength of the evidence (grade), using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the quality, quantity, consistency, magnitude of effect, and generalizability of available evidence. Findings Twenty -two prospective cohort studies conducted between 1989 and 2012 (from 18 cohorts) were included in this review. To derive dietary patterns, 15 studies used factor analysis and 5 studies used cluster analysis. Two studies generated dietary patterns using both factor and cluster analysis. Study durat ion ranged from 2 to 21 years. Seven st udies were conducted in the United States; two studies eac h were conducted in Sweden, Italy, Japan , and Denmark; and the remaining s tudies were conducted in the United Kingdom , Spain, Australia, Finland, Greece, Germany, and the Netherlands. Dietary Patterns 116 Variability in the studies included in this review, including populatio ns considered, dietary assessment methods used, the number and type of food groupings included in the analyses, and the statistical techniques employed, made comparisons among studies challenging. In general, the favorable patterns were variously labeled \"Mediterranean,\" \"vegetable,\" \"prudent,\" \"Japanese.\" The and processed meat,\" \"meat,\" \"animal food,\" or \"sweets\" patterns. Nine studies e xamined dietary patterns and their association with CVD outcomes. Eight studies used factor analysis, and two used cluster analysis; only one study analyzed dietary intake beyond the baseline measure. Generally , dietary patterns characterized by vegetable s, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low -fat dairy products were more consistently associated with a decreased risk of CVD, while patterns characterized by red and processed meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, and fried foods were somewhat less consisten tly associated with increased risk. The evidence that evaluates the association between other related outcomes, as coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, lipid levels , and blood pressure were insufficient and not consistent. Discussion The ability to draw strong conclusions was limited by the following issues: In factor and cluster analysis, the consolidation of food items into food groups, the number of factors or clusters to extract, and even the labeling of components are subjective. Furthermore, patterns derived from either factor or cluster analysis may not be reproducible across studies because elements of dietary patterns and analytic decisions differ. Dietary pattern analysis using factor or cluster methods may not be very informative in determining which elements of the diet or which biological relation ships between these elements are responsible for the health outcome. Some studies completed over long periods of time did not account for changes to subjects' diets or seasonal variations in food supplies, which may have influenced the food components of p atterns. The patterns derived through analyses may not represent the most beneficial or detrimental patterns relative to the health outcome of interest. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY How combinations of foods and beverages, or dietary patterns, impact cardiovascular disease In the past, researchers looked at the relationship between individual foods and nutrients and health. Today, there is interest in looking at how combinations of foods and beverages, or dietary patterns, impact health. Statistical methods called factor and cluster analyses can be used to describe the patterns of foods and beverages people eat. This summary of a NEL review presents what we know about dietary patterns of certain groups of people described using factor and cluster analys is and the likelihood of increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Conclusion Limited evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that dietary patterns characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low -fat dairy products, assessed using cluster or factor analysis, are associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease in adults. Evidence of a relationship between dietary patterns characterized by red and processed meat, s ugar-sweetened foods and drink s, and fried foods, on the one hand, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, on the other, is limited and less consistent. Dietary Patterns 117 What the Research Says Consuming a diet pattern characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low -fat dairy products may prevent adults from increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. This review raised some key issues that make it harder to make stronger recommendations: o There were many differences in how the studies were done. o The dietary patterns differed a lot between studies. EVIDENCE PORTFOLIO Conclusion Statement Limited evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that dietary patterns, assessed using cluster or factor analysis, characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low -fat dairy products are associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease in adults. Evidence of a relationship between dietary patterns characterized by red and processed meat, s ugar-sweetened foods and drink s, and fried foods and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease is limited and less consistent. Grade III - Limited Key Findings Cluster and factor analyses are data- driven approaches that describe the dietary patterns consumed by the study population. High v ariability in the studies included in this review, including populations, case number, sample size, dietary assessment techniques, methods used to define and retain factors and clusters, confounders considered and the statis tical analysis employed, made comparisons among studies challenging. Patterns derived from either factor or cluster analyses are not reproducible across studies. The consolidation of food items into food groups, the number of factors or clusters to extract , and the labeling of components are based on subjective decisions. Patterns using the same naming convention frequently contain different foods or groups of foods, making it difficult to draw conclusions. In general, favorable associations with CVD risk were seen in dietary patterns characterized by high consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low -fat dairy product s. The unfavorable patterns, characterized by high intake of red and processed meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , and fried foods, were more mixed in results, with no association with risk frequently found. Association of patterns with favorable and unfavorable characteristics with CHD risk was mixed. Favorable patterns described as \"prudent;\" \"healthy;\" \"evolved Mediterranean;\" \"bread, cereals, vegetables, fish, potatoes and oils;\" and \"whole grains and fruit\" had an inverse association with CHD, while other patterns described as \"prudent\" or \"healthy \" had no association with CHD . The same inconsistency was found among unfavorable patterns described as \"western\" or \"animal .\" Variation in the number, design, size of s tudies, and patterns identified made it difficult to identify trends related to myocardial infarction, stroke, measures of blood lipids , and blood pressure. Evidence Summary Overview Description of the E vidence Factor and cluster analyses are data- driven approaches that empirically der ive food intake patterns . A description of these techniques is found in a ppendix A. A total of 22 prospective cohort studies conducted between 1989 and 2012 (from 18 cohorts) were included in this review. Sixteen received a positive quality 1,146 to 72,113 participants (four studies <2,000; eight studies 3,000 to 9,000; six wi th 20,000 to 50,000, and four > 50,000 subjects). The three largest cohorts were from the Nurses' Health Study (Fung, 2001; Fung, 2004; Hiedemann , 2008) , two small cohorts were from two rural Italian villages within the Seven Countries Study on Cardiovascular Disease (Farchi , 1989; Menotti, 2001), and two small cohorts were from the Danish WHO -MONICA s urvey (Osler and Andreasen, 2002; Osler and Heitmann , 2001). Study duration ran ged from 2 to 21 years (seven <10 years, eight betw een 10 to 15 years, and seven >15 in Sweden, Italy, Japan , and Denmark, and the remaining st udies were condu cted in the United Kingdom , Spain, Australia, Finland, Greece, Germany , and the Netherlands. Population: All studies analyzed prospective data which, in general, included subjects free of cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes. Six studies did not exclude participants with of these studies was conducted in children and adolescent s (Mikkil\u00e4 , 2007) and four adjusted for the presence of chronic disease or disease 2007), three studies included only men (Farchi , 1989; Hu, 2000; Menotti, 2011), and two studies analyzed health outcomes separately by gender (Hlebowicz 2011, Maruyama 2012). Age range at basel ine s panned from 18 to 89 years; 15 studies recruited middle - aged and older populations (above 35 years) , and two studies recruited young subjects at baseline, including children 3 to 18 years (Mikkila , 2007) and young adults 18 to 30 years (Duff ey, 2012). Only one study identified the race/ethnic subgroups of their cohort (Nettleton , 2009). Dietary Assessment Methodology: Dietary intake was assessed using a baseline food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in 1 6 studies from the Nurses' Health Study aggregated d ata from multiple FFQs c ompleted at three (Fung , 2001; Fung, 2004) and five (Heidemann , 2008) time points during the a diet history approach, two from the Seven Country Study relied on data col lected in 1965 (Farchi , 1989; Menotti, 2001), one study used a validated interviewer -administered diet history conducted in the mid -eighties (Duffey , 2012), anothe r from the EPIC Spanish cohort used a vali dated computerized diet history conducted in the early nineties (Guallar -Castill\u00f3n , 2012), and another study used a diet history que stionnaire combined with a 7 -day food record completed in the early nineties (Hlebowicz, 2011). The longitudinal study invol ving children (Menotti , 2011) used a 48 -hour recall to assess dietary intake. Dietary Pattern Methodology: In general, individual food and beverage items were consolidated into food groups based on established criteria, and dietary patterns were then generated by either factor analysis or cluster analysis. A factor analysis technique was used in 15 studies (Ak esson , 2011) generated dietary patterns using both factor and cluster analysis. Once dietary patterns were defined , analysis was conducted to assess the association between dietary patterns and health. Health Outcomes: The studies in this body of evidence focus on both endpoint clinical outcomes and CVD risk factors (intermediate outcomes). Evidence was organized in to the fol lowing categories for analysis: cardiovascular Dietary Patterns 119 disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure and blood lipid levels including LDL -C, HDL -C, and triglycerides. Themes Nine studies, ranging in size from 1,221 to 64,037 subjects (4 studies with greater than 20,000 subjects) and conducted in Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America (two studies conducted in the United States ) examined dietary patterns and their association with CVD outcomes (table 4 analysis, one used cluster analysis (Hlebowicz, 2011), one used both cluster and factor analysi s (Panagiotakos , 2008), and only one study (Heidemann , 2008) analyzed dietary intake beyond the baseline measure. Generally , dietary patterns characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low -fat dairy products were more consistently associated with a decreased risk of CVD, while patterns characterized by red and processed meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , and fried foods were somewhat le ss consistently associated with increased risk. The favorable patterns were variously labeled \"Mediterranean,\" \"vegetable,\" \"prudent,\" \"whole grains oil,\" and \" Japanese.\" The patterns were labeled as \"West ern,\" \"meat,\" or \"sweets\" patterns and were more mixed in results, with no association with risk frequently found. Ten studies, including a wide range of sample sizes (1,221 to 69,017 subjects, five with less than 7,000 subjects), conducted in Europe, N orth America, and Asia, examined dietary patterns and their association with CHD outcomes (table 4 -B-II-2). Two studies (Brunner , 2008; Farchi , 1989) used 2007), and one used both cluster and factor analyses. Association of patterns with favorable and unfavorable characteristics with CHD risk was mixed. Favorable patterns were described as \"prudent;\" \"healthy;\" \" evolved Mediterranean;\" \"bread, cereals, vegetables, fish, potatoes , and oils;\" and \"whole grains and fruit\" had an inverse association with CHD, while other patterns described as \"prudent\" or \"healthy \" had no association with CHD. The same inconsistency w as found among unfavorable patterns. Patterns described as \"Western\" were either related to increased CHD risk or had no significant association. Two small studies (<6,500 subjects), one conducted in the United States and the other in the United Kingdom , and one large study (24,444 subjects) conducted in Sweden, examined the association of dietary patterns with fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (table 4 -B-II-3). One study used cluster analysis and two studies used factor analysis, and all studies assessed di etary intake at baseline only. In general , patterns with favorable characteristics were more consistently associated with decreased risk, while the unfavorable patterns consistently had no association with fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Favorable patterns were described as \"healthy,\" \"Mediterranean -like,\" and \"whole grains and fruits.\" The unfavorable patterns were described as \"Western/Swedish,\" \"sweets,\" and \"fats and processed meat.\" Four large studies (>35,000) and one s mall study (1,536 subjects), conducted in Europe, Asia, and North America (one large U .S. study, two large Japanese studies), examined the association between dietary patterns and incidence of stroke (table 4 -B-II-4). Three studies (Fung , 2004; Maruyama, 2 012; Shimazu , 2007) used factor one study used cluster analysis (Farchi , 1989 ), and one ( Stricker , 2012 ) used bot h. Association of patterns with favorable and unfavorable characteristics with incidence of stroke was mixed. Favorable patterns described as \"dairy product\" and \"prudent\" were found to decrease risk, while patterns described as \"prudent\" and \"vegetable\" were found not to be associated with risk. Also, a \"Japanese\" pattern was found to decrease st roke risk. One \"unhealthy\" pattern w as associated with increased risk, while two \"animal food\" patterns and a \"Western component\" pattern had no association with risk. Five small studies (ranging from 1,146 to 8,552 subjects), three conducted in 2007; Panagiotakos 2008) , assessed the association between dietary patterns and lipid levels , blood pressure and/or incidence of hypertension (table 4 - Dietary Patterns 120 B-II-5). Three of four studies evaluated an association with HDL, triglyceride, and/or LDL levels and found a favorable pattern generally had an inverse association with one or more of these measures. Five studies evaluated blood pressure or hypertension . Three of the five found no association b etween dietary patterns and BP, while the remaining two showed a protective effect in consuming a \"health -conscious\" pattern or a pattern characterized by cereals, small fish, hardtack, and olive oil . Although there were some vague signs that favor a healthier pattern, the number and size of the studies make it difficult to identify any clear trends.

Si xteen of 22 studies were found to be of positive quality, indicating a low risk of bias and random error. The other six studies received a neutral quality rating. Consistency In general, favorable associations with CVD risk were seen in dietary patterns characterized by high consumption of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, fish, and low -fat dairy, an d other foods. Dietary patterns showing some times unfavorable associations with CVD risk were described as unhealthy or Western and were in general characterized by high intake of red meat, processed meat, deep -fried foods, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , and refined grains. No clear pattern of association was identified between dietary patterns and risk for coronary heart disease. In addit ion, the number, design, size of studies , and variation in patterns identified make it difficult to identify trends related to myocardial infarction, stroke , and measures of blood lipids and blood pressure. Impact The studies evaluated varied with regard to dietary assessment methods. Patterns using the same naming convention may contain very different foods or groups of foods and patterns, making it difficult to draw conclusions. Variations in the number of study s ubjects and subjective decisions involved in deriving and retain ing factors and clusters for analysis likely influence power and the ability to detect associations. Generalizability/External Validity All studies but one (Mikkil\u00e4 , 2007) recruited adult population, and both men and women were well represented. Studies were conducted in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia, and populations were primarily W hites. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status were often not reported or included in analyses. Subs equently, the conclusion for this review is limited to W hite adults. Limitations of the Evidence Most longitudinal studies included only baseline measure of dietary intake and did not account for changes to subjects' diets, availability and variations in the food supply, which may have influenced the food components of patterns. Variations in the num ber and type of food groupings and definitions and naming conventions found in the review are not easily comparable and factors with the same naming convention (e.g., \"vegetable\" or \"healthy\") may include somewhat different foods or groups of foods with va rying factor loadings. Differences in the statistical analysis approaches used to derive and retain factors and clusters influences power and the ability to detect an association. Patterns derive d from factor analysis and cluster analy ses were analyzed d ifferently. In factor analysis, \"high\" scores were generally compared with \"low\" scor es of the same pattern, though it was not clear what characteristic differences there were in a \"hi gh\" versus \"low\" score factor. In cluster analysis, one cluster was comp ared with another one, making it difficult to interpret results together. Research Recommendations Evaluate and standardize methods used to assess, organize, aggregate, and adjust food variables to facilitate interpretation of findings across studies. Additional research is needed to examine if and how gender, age, SES , and ethnicity might influence the relationship between dietary patterns and cardiovascular disease risk. Explore the characteristics of dietary patterns beyond food choice, such as timing and frequency of meals, meal sizes, and eating occasions. Dietary Patterns 137 REFERENCES 1.

Obbagy What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using reduced rank regression analysis, and cardiovascular disease? TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review project is to identify patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Historically, most dietary guidance has been based on research conducted on individual food components or nutrients. Die tary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Reduced rank regression (RRR) is a statistical method that determines dietary patterns (combinations of food intake) that explain as much variation as possible among a set of response variables related to a health outcome of interest. It is an a posteriori method since it uses both existing evidence a nd exploratory statistics. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between patterns of food and beverage intake identified using reduced rank regression, and risk for cardiovascular disease. Conclusion Statement Insufficie nt evidence, due to a small number of studies, was available to examine the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and risk of cardiovascular disease. The disparate nature of the methods used made it difficult to compar e results, and therefore, no conclusions were drawn. (Grade: Not Assignable) Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts), and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression analysis and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Studies that met the following criteria were included in the review: Human subjects; Ages: 2 years and older; Populations: Healthy and those with elevated chronic disease risk; individuals with chronic disease; published in English in a peer-reviewed journal; Sample size: Minimum of 30 subjects per study arm; Dropout rate less than 20 percent ; Study assesses dietary intake using reduced rank regression analysis; study considered cardiovascular disease and risks of cardiovascular disease; subjects from countries with high or very high human development (based on the 2011 Human Development Index). The date r ange for the conduct of the studies was unlimited. The results of each included study were summarized in evidence worksheets (including a study quality rating) and evidence table. A group of subject matter experts were involved in a qualitative synthesis of the body of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the strength of the evidence (grade) using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the quality, quantity and consistency, magnitude of effect , and generalizability o f available evidence. Findings Four prospective cohort studies examined dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression analysis and their association with CVD risks and incidence. The studies ranged in size from 981 to 26,238 subjects, and one study each was conducted in the United States , United Kingdom, and Germany, and one included subjects from Europe. The follow -up for these studies ranged in duration fr om 6 to 25 years. Dietary Patterns 140 Comparison across studies was limited by the small number of studi es, differences in methodologies used, and in the populations studied. Therefore no conclusions were drawn. More U .S. population -based research is needed to examine dietary patterns and risk of cardiovascular disease using reduced rank regression, prefera bly with more consistent methods and response variables. Discussion The ability to draw a gradable conclusion was limited due to the following issues: Three out of the four studies used biomarkers and the fourth study used nutrients as response variabl es in the reduced rank regression analyses. Among the three studies that used biomarkers as response variables , there were differences in the type of biomarkers chosen, leading to the identification of dietary patterns that differed from study to study. On e study used change in BMI, mean arterial pressure, total cholesterol, HDL -cholesterol, triglycerides (mg/dl), fasting glucose , and uric acid. The second study used C -reactive protein, Interleukin (IL) - 6, and Interleukin (IL) -18, while the third study used total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. The fourth study used nutrients, including total fat, total carbohydrate, and fiber, as response variables. Because the dietary patterns described in each study are directly linked to response variabl es chosen, the variation in the response variables used means that the resulting dietary patterns may not be comparable. Dietary assessment methods were different across the studies. One study used 3 -day diet records; another used a self-admin istered FFQ; a third used a 127- item validated FFQ , and the fourth study used a 7 -day dietary record. It is unclear what impacts different dietary assessment methods have on the derivation of dietary patterns using reduced rank regression. The studies were not consiste nt in their use of confounders in analyses. In particular, physical activity was not included as a confounder in the analyses by one study, and another did not include smoking as a confounder. The studies were conducted in different countries, representin g populations in different regions of the world, which limited the ability to compare and interpret the results due to potential differences in dietary patterns between these regions. From that perspective, the results may not be generalizable to some U .S. populations. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Combinations of food intake (assessed using reduced rank regression) that explain the most variation in risk of cardiovascular disease Researchers have previously looked at the relationship between individual foods and nutrients and health. Today, there is interest in looking at how combinations of foods and beverages intake, or dietary patterns, influence health by applying different sci entific methods. A statistical method called reduced rank regression analysis can be used to describe the patterns of foods and beverages people eat based on a set of \"response variables\" that are known to be related to the health outcome of interest. This summary of a NEL review presents what research evidence currently exist when reduced rank regression analysis is the method used to study the dietary patterns of groups of people and their likelihood of developing the risk for cardiovascular diseases such as high blood lipids, high blood pressure , and heart disease. Conclusion Insufficient evidence, due to a small number of studies, was available to examine the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and risk of cardi ovascular disease. The disparate nature of the methods used made it difficult to compare results, and therefore, no conclusions were drawn. Dietary Patterns 141 What the Research Says Four studies looked at dietary patterns found using reduced rank regression analysis and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. However, these studies had some key issues that make it hard to make any recommendations: There were few studies available. There were many differences in how the studies were done. The populations studied we re different between studies. EVIDENCE PORTFOLIO Conclusion Statement Insufficient evidence, due to a small number of studies, was available to examine the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and risk of cardiovascular disease. The disparate nature of the methods used made it difficult to compare results, and therefore, no conclusions were drawn. Grade IV - Not Assignable Key Findings: Four positive quality prospective cohort studies that used reduced rank regression to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and cardiovascular disease (CVD) status were included in this review. Comparison across studies is limited by the small number of studies, differences in methodologies used, and in the populations studied. Therefore no conclusions were drawn. More U .S. population -based research is needed to examine dietary patterns and risk of cardiovascular disease using reduced rank regression, preferably with more consistent methods and response variabl es. Evidence Summary Overview Description of the E vidence Four prospective cohort studies included in this reduced rank regression analysis (see appendix A) to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and CVD . All of the studies were rated positive quality. One stu dy each was conducted in the United States , United Kingdom, and Germany, and one included subjects from Europe. The sample sizes for these studies ranged from 981 to 26,238 participants ( 1 study <1000, 1 study <8,000, 1 study <14,000, and 1 study >26,000). All four studies were conducted in adults. Three of the studies included both females and males, while one study included only males (Meyer , 2011) . The studies in this review used different dietary assessment methods, including 3 -day diet records (Heroux 2009), a self-admini stered validated FFQ (McNaughton , 2009), and a 7- day dietary record (Meyer, 2011). The studies also examined a variety of CVD -related outcomes: (2009) death due to CVD and nonfatal incident of CHD; and Meyer (2011) , examined incidence of fetal or nonfatal MI and sudden cardiac death or mortality from CHD. The independent variables in all four studies were dietary pattern scores derived using reduced rank regression analysis. Three studies used biomarkers as response variables ( Heroux, 2009; McNaughton , 2009; Meyer 2011), while the fourth study used nutrients as response variables ( Drogan, 2007). The response variables used and the respective dietary patterns extracted for each study are described in more detail below: Dietary Patterns 142 Evidence Summary Paragraphs Drogan 2007 selected total fat, total carbohydrates , and fiber as response variables. Three d ietary patterns were extracted. Pattern 1 explained the greatest variation in a ll three response variables (53 percent ). Pat terns 2 a nd 3 explained only 21 percent and 10 percent of the variation. Only p attern 1 was used in subsequent analyses to calculate a pattern score for each subject and included foods such as whole- grain bread, fresh fruit, fruit juices, grains, cereals , and raw v egetables. Heroux 2007 selected BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL -cholesterol, triglycerides (mg/dl), fasting glucose, uric acid , and white blood cell count as response variables. Five dietary patterns were extracted , which together explained 5.66 percent of the variation within the total biomarker index. Pattern 1 explained 4.33 percent of the overall variation, with the other four patterns onl y explaining an additional 1.33 percent between them. Thus, pattern 1 accounted for 76.50 percent of the total variation and the pattern was labeled \"Unhealthy eating Index .\" Pattern 1 was characterized by elevated consumption of processed and red meat, white potato products, non -whole grains, added fat, and reduced consumption of non -citrus fruits. McN aughton 2009 selected total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides as response variables. Three dietary patterns were extracted, and patterns 1 and 2 explained the most variation in the response variables (D ietary pattern 1 explained 7.14 percent of variation in HDL cholesterol and 5.3 percent of variation in triglycerides, while dietary pattern 2 explained 3.5 percent of variation in total cholesterol) and were used in subsequent analyses. Pattern 1 was characterized by high intakes of white bread , fried potatoes, sugar in tea and coffee, burgers, and soft drinks and lower consumption of salad dressings and vegetables. Pattern 2 was characterized by higher consumption of red meat, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower and lower consumption of whole meal bread , jam, marmalade, tofu, buns, cakes, pastries, fruit pies, and margarine. Meyer 2011 selected C -reactive protein, Interleukin (IL) -6, and Interleukin (IL) -18 as response variables. Pattern 1 showed a high score of the RRR -derived pattern characterized by high intakes of meat, soft drinks and beer and low intakes of vegetables, fresh fruit , chocolates, cake, pastries, whole meal bread, cereals, muesli, curd, condensed milk, cream, butter, nuts, sweet bread spread , and tea.

Pattern 1: Compared to quartile 1, risk of CHD was increased by 57% in quartile 4 (P = 0.003) Quartile 1 vs. quar tile 4: HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.08 - 2.27 Pattern 2 : NS; no relationship between Pattern 2 and CHD risk in the fully adjusted model (after adjusting for BMI, BP) Meyer, 2011 Positive Quality Prospective cohort MONICA cohort Germany To examine dietary patterns associated with inflammatory markers and to examine their impact on the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and all - cause mortality. C-reactive protein Interleukin (IL) - 6 Interleukin (IL) -18 Pattern 1: (+) intake of diets rich in meat and beer and low in fresh and cooked vegetables, fresh fruit, whole meal bread, cereals and muesli, curd, nuts, sweet bread spread and tea identified with higher risk for CHD. During follow -up, there were 101 cases of incident CHD and 88 cases of CHD mortality. CHD and CHD mortality: NS; no relationship between dietary pattern score and CVD mortality in the fully adjusted model (after adjusting for smoking status) Dietary Patterns 144 Qualitative Assessment of the Body of Evidence This review included four positive -quality prospective cohort studies. However, because there were so few studies available, variability in the methodology used in the studies that were reviewed, and populations considered, there was insufficient information from which to assess consistency or draw conclusions about the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and risk of CVD. Limitations of the Evidence Methodological Differences: Three out of the f our studies used biomarkers and the fourth study used nutrients as response variables in the reduced rank regression analyses. Among the three studies that used biomarkers as response variables , there were differences in the type of biomarkers chosen, leading to the identification of dietary patterns that differed from study to study. Heroux (2009 ) used change in BMI, mean arterial pressure, total cholesterol, HDL - cholesterol, triglycerides (mg/d l), fasting glucose , and uric acid; Meyer (2011 ) used C -reactive protein, Interleukin (IL)- 6, and Interleukin (IL) -18; and McNaughton (2009) used total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyce rides. The fourth study, Drogan (2007) , used nutrients, includ ing total fat, total carbohydrate, and fiber, as response variables. Because the dietary patterns described in each study are directly linked to response variables chosen, the variation in the response variables used means that the resulting dietary patter ns may not be comparable. Dietary assessment methods were different across the studies. One study used 3 -day diet records (Herou x 2009); another used a self -administered FFQ (Drogan a third used a 127- item validated FFQ (McNaughton 2009) ; and the fo urth study used a 7 -day dietary record (Meyer 2011). It is unclear what impacts different dietary assessment methods have on the derivation of dietary patterns using reduced rank regression. The studies were not consistent in their use of confounders in analyses. In particular, physical activity was not included as a conf ounder in the analyses by Meyer ( 2011) , and Drogan ( 2007) did not include smoking as a confounder. Population Differences: The studies were conducted in different countries ( United States and several countries in Europe ) and represented populations in different regions of the world, which limited the ability to compare and interpret the results due to potential differences in dietary patterns between these regions. From that perspective, t he results may not be generalizable to some U .S. populations. Research Recommendations More research using reduced rank regression should be conducted. Additionally, standardization in methodology , such as food groupi ngs and response variables used, are also needed. Dietary Patterns 145 REFERENCES 1.

McGrane What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/ recommendations or specific dietary patterns (assessed using methods other than index/score, cluster or factor, or reduced rank regression analyses) and risk of cardiovascular disease? TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this s ystematic review project is to identify patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Historically, most dietary guidance has been based on research conducted on individual food components or nutrients. Dietary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Different methods of analyses are used to assess dietary patterns including index or score, cluster or factor, reduced rank regression, in addition to other methods, to exam the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns of a population and outcomes of public health concern. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relatio nship between patterns of food and beverage intake identified using methods other than index or score, factor or cluster, or reduced rank analyses, and risk of cardiovascular disease. Conclusion Statement There is strong and consistent evidence that con sumption of a DASH diet results in reduced blood pressure in adults with above optimal blood pressure, up to and including stage 1 hypertension. A dietary pattern consistent with the DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, low -fat dairy, fish, whole grain s, fiber, potassium , and other minerals at recommended levels and low in red and processed meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. There is limited evidence that adherence to vegetarian diets is associated with decreased death from ischemic heart disease, with the association being stronger in men than in women. (Grade: I -Strong - DASH and Blood Pressure; Grade: III- Limited - Vegetarian and Ischemic Heart Disease) Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts) , and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns defined using methods other than index factor or cluster analysis and body weight status. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the review : conducted in subject s aged 2 to 18 years; randomized controlled trials, non -randomized controlled trials, or quasi -experimental studies; subjects from countries with high or very high human development (based on the 2011 Human Development Index); subjects who were healthy or a t elevated chronic disease risk; published in English in a peer -reviewed journal. The date range was unlimited. The results of each included study were summarized in evidence worksheets (including a study quality rating) and an evidence table. A group of subject matter experts were involved in a qualitative synthesis of the body of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the strength of the evidence (grade) using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the quality, quant ity, consistency, magnitude of effect , and generalizability of available evidence. Dietary Patterns 147 Findings Two types of dietary patterns were identified using other methods of assessing dietary exposure related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk: ( 1) a DASH dieta ry pattern and ( 2) a vegetarian -style dietary pattern. Evidence from RCTs showed a DASH diet resulted in reduced blood pressure (BP) including systolic BP (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (BP) in adults with above optimal blood pressure, up to and including stage 1 hypertension, with further reductions with the low sodium DASH modification and the DASH high protein or DASH high unsaturated fat modifications (OmniHeart). Addition of a behavioral intervention or weight management intervention together with the DASH diet was more effective in reducing BP than DASH diet alone (PREMIER, ENCORE). Approximately two- thirds of the U .S. population has pre -hypertension or hypertension. Evidence from prospective cohort studies showed a vegetarian diet was associated with redu ced ischemic heart disease (IHD) or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in four out of six studies . In studies that showed a favorable association for the vegetarian diet, the risk reduction for men was greater than that for women. The association between vegetarian diets and BP was less clear. Studies that examined cerebrovascular disease or stroke mortality did not find differences between vegetarians and non -vegetarians. The results of either a DASH diet or vegetarian diet on blood lipids were mixe d regarding effects on total -, LDL -, and HDL -cholesterol and triglycerides. The DASH diet is high in fruits, vegetables, low -fat diary, whole grains, fish, fiber, potassium, and other minerals at recommended levels and low in red and processed meat, sugar-sweetened foods and drinks , saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. Vegetarian diets include vegan (no meat, fish, eggs, or dairy); lacto -ovo vegetarian (includes eggs and dairy, but no fish or meat), and pesco vegetarian (includes fish, but no meat) diets. Discussion There were limitations of the evidence in this review. In the DASH trials, including the original DASH and DASH - sodium, the feeding phases were relatively brief (4 -8 wks) and the trial outcomes were CVD ris k factors, not clinical events. In DASH trials with free -living populations, including PREMIER and ENCORE, there was the potential for selection bias, as participants may have been more motivated toward behavior modifications. The studies on vegetarian diets were all prospective cohort studies and there was the potential for vegetarian cohorts to be relatively health conscious in other lifestyle components, in addition to diet. Additionally, in these studies, analyses relied on single baseline measurements of diet, without further dietary intake assessment over the time course of prospective studies. Related to the specific systematic review question on dietary patterns, vegetarian diets including vegan, lacto -ovo vegetarian, and pesco vegetarian, were most often described by what was ex cluded from the diet rather than a full dietary pattern including all foods and beverages consumed. Overall, the definition of vegetarian diets has not been standardized. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Are the amounts, types, variety , or combinations of foods and beverages people frequently eat and drink related to the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease? In the past, researchers looked at the relationship between individual foods and nutrients and health. Today, there is interest in looking at how combinations of foods and beverages, or dietary patterns, impact health. This summary of a NEL review presents what we know about different healthy eating patterns and the amounts, variety or combination of different foods and drinks, and how often they are eaten effect the risk of cardiovascular (heart) disease. Dietary Patterns 148 Conclusion There is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of a DASH diet results in reduced blood pressure in adults with above optimal blood pressure, up to and including stag e 1 hypertension. A dietary pattern consistent with the DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, low -fat dairy, fish, whole grains, fiber, potassium , and other minerals at recommended levels and low in red and processed meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. There is limited evidence that adherence to vegetarian diets is associated with decreased death from ischemic heart disease, with the association being stronger in men than in women.

Evidence Summary Overview Description of the Evidence A total of 20 articles met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review on dietary patterns and incident CVD outcomes assessed using methods other than index/score, cluster or factor, or reduced rank regression analyses. The body of evidence consisted of 14 articles from 8 randomized con trolled trials (RCTs) , 1988; Chang 1999; Orlich , 2013). In terms of study quality, 15 of the 20 articles received a positive quality rating and five were rated neutral (Burr and Butland , 1988; Chang 1999; Margetts , 1985). The studies were carried out between 1985 and 2013. Twelve articles were from 6 RCTs and one PCS conducted in the United States ; three PCSs were conducted in the U nited Kingdom , Australia, and Germany; and two RCTs were conducted in Sweden and Iran, and there was one pooled analysis of cohort studies conducted in the U nited States, United Kingdom , and Germany. The sample sizes of the RCTs ranged from 49 to 44,351 participants (12 studies <500; 1 study >500; 1 study >40,000) and the PCSs had sample sizes of 1,724 to 76,172 parti cipants (1 study > 1,000; 2 studies >10,000; 2 study >70,000). All of the studies were conducted with adults, with the exception of the RCT conducted in I ran on adolescent girls (Saneei , 2013). Eighteen out of 20 articles included men and women. One RCT included onl y post - menopausal women (Howard , 2006) and one RCT include d only adolescent girls (Saneei , 2013). RCT duration ranged from 30 days to 8.1 years (9 <2 months; 4 <6 months; 1 > 8 years) and PCSs ranged from a mean of 5.8 years to 21 years (1 <10 years; 2 >10 years; 1 >15 years; 1 >20 years). Dietary patterns examined: Ten of the 20 articles reported results from the original Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (D ASH) trial (Appel , 1997; Conlin , 2000; Moore , 1999; Obarzanek , 2001) or subsequent trials that examined either variations o n the original DASH diet (Appe ,l 2005 [Omni 2004 [DASH -sodium]) or added behavioral interventions to the original DASH diet in free -living populations (Blumenthal , 2010 [PREMIER]; Blumenthal Babyak and Sherwood, 2010 [PREMIER]; Lien, 2007 [ENCORE]). A small trial in Iran also tested a DASH diet m odified for adolescents (Saneei , 2013). Three additional RCTs looked at a Nordic diet (Adamsson , 2011), a low -fat dietary pattern ( 2006 [WHI -DM]), and ovo -lacto diet Dietary Patterns 150 (Margetts , 1985). The diets examined in the six PCSs were vegetarian, in some cases including pesco -vegetarian, 1999; Orlich , 2013). Population: The original DASH trial and subsequent DASH modification trials commo nly included adult subjects that were generally healthy but with pre -hypertension or with untreated stage I hypertension. Additionally, B lack and minority subgroups were well -represented in these trials, Blacks accounted for 39 to 65 percent of the trial populations, in addition to ot her minorities from 1 to 6 percent (Appel , 1997 and 2005; Blumenthal ass essment: Dietary intake in this review was assessed by adherence to a specific dietary pattern using a variety of methods (i.e., food frequency questionnaire [FFQ], food record/diary/checklists, 24- hour recall, responses to a \"Yes/No\" question asking if subjects were vegetarian), and urinary mineral and urea nitrogen analyses. The DASH and DASH -sodium trials were controlled feeding trials where subjects received prepared meals consumed on- site, with some meals consumed off -site. For each day of controlled feeding, subjects recorded their intake of discretionary items. They indicated whether they ate any non -study foods and whether they did not eat all the study foods. Adherence to the diet was fu rther assessed by measuring 24 -hour urinary sodium, potassium, phosphorous, and urea nitrogen. In the free -living ENCORE trial (DASH + Weight Management), as well as the Women's Health Initiative Dietary M odification (WHI -DM) trial (low -fat diet), food intake was assessed with both FFQs and 4 -day food records. In t he PREMIER trial, dietary intake was assessed from two unannounced 24 -hour dietary recalls conducted by telephone. Self -reported dietary intake was corroborated using the 24 -hour urinary measures indicated above for DASH. The small DASH trial in Iran, small NorDiet trial in Sweden, and the small lacto -ovo vegetarian trial in Australia all used daily diet records to assess adherence. Prospective cohort studies on vegetarian diets assessed d ietary intake using FFQs [Adventist Health Study 2]). Of these studies, only one assessed dietary intake after baseline: Change- Claude (2005 ) conducted a foll ow-up on dietary changes at 5 and 11 years. However, a few stud ies only asked participants if they were a vegetarian (i.e., defined as those who did not eat meat or fi sh) (Key , 1999; Burr and Butland , 1988). Qualitative Synthesis of the Collected Evidence Themes and Key Findings Health Outcomes: The 20 articles in this review considered CVD risk factors, or intermediate outcomes, including hypertension, blood pressure, and blood lipids and endpoint health outcomes including CVD incidence or mortality. Intermediate Outcomes: Hypertension, Blood Pressure , and Blood Lipids: Nine articles reported results from the DASH and modified DASH trials on the effect of dietary intake on changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) or ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in prehypertensive an d/or adults Two of these articles also reported on hypertension/blood pressure control (Conlin , 2000; Svetkey , 2004). One article reported results from the WHI -DM trial with subjects who had blood pressure that was either treated, stage 1 hypertension, or strayed into the high end of the range (>140/90 mm) (Howard , 2006). One small trial reported on the effect of a Nordic diet on SBP and DBP (Adamsson , 2011). Lastly, in all of these studies subjects were not on anti -hypertensive medications, with one exception where medicat ion was not indicated (Adamsson , 2011). Dietary Patterns 151 Six of the above articles also reported on blood li pids, including total cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein [LDL] looked at LDL cholesterol. DASH Trials: Eleven of the 20 articles reported on the original DASH or a var iation on the DASH trial (Appel, 1997 and 2005; Blumenthal , 2010; Blumenthal DASH Trial : The original DASH trial compared a control diet that was typical of a substantial number of Americans with either ( 1) a fruits and vegetables diet or ( 2) a combination d iet that was rich in fruits and vegetables and low -fat dairy foods. The trial showed that consumption of the combination diet (DASH) reduced SBP and DBP in prehypertensive and hypertensive adults (Appel , 1997). When hypertensive subjects in the DASH trial were assessed separately, the combination DASH diet resulted in a greater reduction in SBP and DBP in hypertensives than in non -hypertensives (Appel , 1997) and a 60 percent decreased risk of hypertension in this subgrou p (Conlin , 2000). Ambulatory BP (ABP) was also assessed and the combination DASH diet resulted in lowered 24 -hour ABP, and the hypertensives had a greater response than non -hypertensive s to the combination DASH diet (Moore , 1999). Furthermore, the combination DASH diet resulted in lower total and LDL -cholesterol, but also lower HDL - cholesterol, and had no effect on triglycerides (Obarzanek , 2001). The net reduction in total - and LDL -cholesterol was greater in men than in women, but there were no differences based on race. DASH -Sodium Trial : The DASH- sodium trial introduced three levels of sodium intake in the DASH diet and a typical U .S. control diet. The reduction in sodium resulted in significantly lowered SBP and DBP in both DASH and control groups; however, the DASH diet resulted in lower SBP than the control di et at every sodium level (Sacks , 2001). Additionally, reducing sodium intake from the high to the low level with either the DASH or control diets reduced SBP in subjects with and without hypertension, and in Blacks and other racial groups, as well as in men and women. But the combination of the two dietary interventions, DASH and low sodium, lowered SBP more in participants with HTN than in those without HTN, and m ore in women than in men (Sacks , 2011). Another report from the DASH -sodium trial examined BP control and found that the maximum BP control rate was achieved with the DASH/ lower sodium treatment (Svetsky , 2004). OmniHeart Trial : Trials that further assessed a DASH dietary approach with modifications included the OmniHeart Trial that assessed diets rich in carbohydrates, protein, or unsaturated fats (predominantly monounsaturated fats) in subjects with prehypertension and stage I hypertension. Although all treatment arms were rich in fruits and vegetables, low -fat dairy, fib er, and potassium and reduced in saturated fat, cholesterol , and sodium, the carbohydrate diet used in OmniHeart was similar to the original DASH diet and the other two treatment arms substituted either unsaturated fats or protein for carbohydrates as 10 percent of energy. All three diets decreased BP, LDL -cholesterol, and 10- year CHD risk (from the Framingham risk equation). However, BP, total - and LDL - cholesterol, triglycerides, and estimated 10 -year CHD risk were all significantly improved in the high p rotein, compared to the high carbohydrate diet. And BP, HDL -cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly improved on the high unsaturated fat diet, compared to th e high carbohydrate diet (Appel , 2005). PREMIER Trial : The PREMIER Trial was a multicomp onent lifestyle intervention in a free -living population that included (1) an advice only control group; ( 2) a group that received established behavioral intervention for lowering BP (EST); and ( 3) a group that received EST plus a DASH diet. In participants without metabolic syndrome (MetSyn), EST and EST + DASH equally reduced SBP. However, in subjects with MetSyn, only the combined EST + DASH intervention resulted in SBP reduction. The effects of the EST and EST + DASH interventions on blood lipids were m ixed, with decreased total cholesterol and a trend to improve LDL -cholesterol in both MetSyn groups, but no effect of EST + DASH on triglycerides (Lien , 2007). Dietary Patterns 152 ENCORE Trial : The Exercise and Nutrition interventions for CardiOvasculaR hEalth (ENCORE) trial was conducted in overweight or obese subjects with high BP and the result s indicated that the DASH diet plus weight management was more effective in decreasing BP than the DASH diet alone (Blumenthal , 2010). A second report from the ENCORE trial showed that the DASH diet alone, although it caused a decrease in BP, did not decrease total- , LDL -cholestero l, or triglycerides (Blumenthal Babyak and Sherwood, 2010). Vegetarian Diets : Three of the articles on vegetarian patterns measured BP or blood lipids (Burr and Butland , 1985). Burr and Butland reported that a vegetarian diet was associated with decreased levels of total cholesterol, compared to non -vegetarians; however, BP measurements were not different between th e two groups (Burr and Butland , 1988). Margetts examined the effect of a lacto -ovo vegetarian diet on BP in mild hypertensives and found a decrease in SBP, but not DBP (Margetts , 1985). In a study of the EPIC -Oxford cohort, comparing a vegetarian to a non -vegeta rian diet showed a reduction in SBP, but not DBP, in a small sub -sample of the cohort (Crowe , 2013). In addition, non -HDL -cholesterol was reduced in the vegetarian participants. Other Diets : Women's Health Initiative - Dietary Modification Trial : Women i n the low -fat diet treatment group of the WHI -DM trial had de creased DBP and LDL -cholesterol; however, other CVD risk factors were not different between groups (Howard , 2006). Nordic Diet : In the NORDIET Trial, the effect of a Nordic diet, compared to a control typical Western diet, on CVD risk factors was assessed. The Nordic diet treatment caused a decrease in SBP, but not DBP. Additionally, total -, LDL -, and HDL -cholesterol, and the LDL/HDL ratio were decreased with the Nordic diet (Adamsson , 2011). Endpoint Clinical Outcomes: CVD Incidence and Mortality : One trial, the WHI -DM Trial, examined the effect of a low -fat diet on incident (fatal and nonfatal) CVD, CHD, and stroke (Howard , 2006). Six prospective cohort studies examined only mortality and these examined the association between a vegetarian diet and ischemic heart disease (I HD) mortality (Burr and a nd 1999), CVD mortality (Orlich , 2013), or mortality due to cir culatory diseases (Chang -Claude , 2005). One trial examined risk of CHD using the Framingham risk equation (Appel , 2005). Vege tarian diets : Four studies that examined IHD found that IHD mortality was decreased in vegetarians compared to no n-vegetarians (Burr and Orlich , 2013). However, one of these studies, conducted with the Adventist Healt h Study 2 cohort, found the association only in men for both IHD and CVD mortality, not in men and women comb ined nor in women alone (Orlich, 2013). Key and colleagues conducted a pooled analysis of five prospective cohort studies and found that mortality from IHD was 24 percent lower in vegetarians compared to non -vegetarians. Additional analysis showed that in comparison with regular meat eaters, mortality from IHD was 34 percent lower in lacto -ovo vegetaria ns and 26 percent lower in vegans (Key , 1999). However, two studies that compared vegetarians with health -conscious non -vegetarians, found IHD mortality was not different between the two groups in the United Kingdom (Key , 1996) and German participants (Chang- Claude , 2005), nor was all ci rculatory disease mortality (Chang -Claude , 2005). In these two studies, one study was relatively small for a prospective cohort study (N = 1,724 subjects) (Chang- Claude , 2005) and one study did not define vegetarians beyond a direct ques tion asked of the p articipants ( i.e., if participants were vegetarian ) (Key , 1996). Studies that examined cerebrovascular disease or stroke mortality did not find differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians (Burr and Butland , 1988; Key, 1996 and1999; Orlich 153 Low-fat diet : The WHI -DM trial examined the effects of a low -fat diet on incident CVD, CHD, and stroke and found no effect on risk in postmenopausal women (Howard , 2006). The WHI -DM intervention resulted in decreased total and saturated fat intake in the treatment group, but also increased intakes of fiber, vegetables and fruits, total and whole grains, and soy. DASH diet (OmniHeart) : In a report from the OmiHeart trial, CHD risk was estimated using the Framingham risk equation (Appel , 2005). The calculated 10 -year risk of CHD was decreased for all versions of the DASH diet (modified to be high in carbohydrate, protein, or unsat urated fat as an increase in 10 percent of energy). Furthermore, compared with the carbohydrate diet, both the protein and unsaturated fat diets resulted in greater reductions in CHD risk. (This result is also considered under intermediate outcomes.) Sub-analysis -Gender: One of the prospective cohort studies that examined total and cause -specific mortality found an association only in men for both IHD and CVD mortality, not in men and women comb ined, nor in women alone (Orlich, 2013). Further analysis of different types of vegetarian patterns showed that for pesco -vegetarians, compared to non - vegetarians, women and men and women combined (but not men alone) had reduced IHD mortality, but only men had reduced CVD mortality. Compari ng lacto -ovo vegetarians to non- vegetarians, CVD mortality was decreased only in men. And in vegans, both IHD and CVD mortality w ere reduced only in men (Orlich , 2013). Earlier studies also found that although there was reduced IHD mortality in men and women in vegetarians compared to non - vegetarians, there was a greater red uction in men (Burr and Butland , 1988; Key, 1999).

The majority of the evidence for this question consisted of positive quality studies (15 out of 20 studies), indicating potential low risk of bias overall. In addition, these studies directly addressed the question, especially related to blood pressure and, additionally, CHD mortality. Consistency Blood Pressure: The evidence of a protective association between a DASH dietary pattern and blood pressure was consistent in all of the RCTs in adults in the general population and adults with hypertension. CHD Mortality : Evidence from prospective cohort studies showed a vegetarian diet was associated with reduced ischemic heart disease (IHD) or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in four out of six studies . In the two studies that did not find an association, one study was relatively small for a prospective cohort study (N = 1,724 subjects) (Chang- Claude , 2005) , and one study did not define vegetarians beyond a direct que stion asked of the participants (i.e., if participants were vegetarian ) (Key , 1996). Impact The body of evidence directly addressed the exposures and health outcomes of interest for this systematic review, with clinical trials that consistently showed that a DASH diet resulted in reduced blood pressure in prehypertensive and hypertensive adults, thus decreasing CVD risk. In the DASH -sodium trial, the effect of DASH diet and low sodium achieved the greatest effect on blood pressure and the effect was equal to or greater than that of a single therapeutic drug for hypertensive individuals (Sacks , 2001). In addition, this body of evidence included large prospective cohort studies that found a favorable association between vegetarian diets and risk of mortality from ischemic heart disease (IHD), especially in men. Generalizability/External Validity Twelve articles from six RCTs and one PCS were conducted in the U nited States , with the remaining articles from studies conducted in the U nited Kingdom , Germany, Sweden, Australia, and Iran. Results from the DASH trials should be broadly applicable to the U .S. population as the trial populations were large and demographically heterogeneous. Additionally, DASH trials focused on individuals with prehypertension and hypertension, a group that makes up approximately two -thirds of the U .S. population. DASH trials were also conducted in free -living populations and found effective (PREMIER and ENCORE). Regarding the association between vegetarian diets and IHD mortality, two recent prospective cohort studies with large cohorts (EPIC -Oxford and Adventist Health 2) showed an association with reduced IHD death, as did one pooled analysis of five prospectiv e cohort studies covering the United States , United Kingdom , and Germany. Given the robust evidence involving U .S. clinical trials and large cohort studies with endpoint mortality outcomes, the generalizability to the U .S. population, and the relevance of this body of eviden ce to U .S. policy, is compelling.

In DASH trials with free -living populations, including PREMIER and ENCORE, there was the potential for selection bias, as participants may have been more motivated toward behavior modifications. The studies on vegetarian diets were all prospective cohort studies , and there was the potential for vegetarian cohorts to be relatively health conscious in other lifestyle components, in addition to diet. Additionally, in these studies, analyses relied on single baseline measurements of diet, without further dietary intak e assessment over the time course of prospective studies. Related to the specific systematic review question on dietary patterns, vegetarian diets including vegan, lacto -ovo vegetarian, and pesco vegetarian, were most -often described by what was excluded f rom the diet rather than a full dietary pattern including all foods and beverages consumed. Overall, the definition of vegetarian diets has not been standardized.

In addition, standardization of the various definitions of vegetaria n diets across different population s and locations would further advance knowledge in this area. The benefits of vegetarian diets are associated, in part, with decreased consumption of animal products; given this, it would help to inform policy if investigators could determine how much of a decrease in animal product consumption is most beneficial related to CVD risk. Methodologically, research in this area could be further improved by measuring dietary intake at regular intervals over the course of prospective studies, rather than just at baseline. Further research needs to be done to clarify the effect of a DASH diet on blood pressure outcomes by racial/ethnic subgroups, as well as gender differences in blood lipid measures. The potential gender differen ce in the association between vegetarian diets and CHD mortality ( i.e., more pronounced in men) needs to be further clarified, and this could be informed by detailed analyses of different forms of vegetarian diets includ ing vegan, lacto -ovo vegetarian, and pesco -vegetarian diets, together with a fuller accounting of what these diets include as well as exclude. Women's diets tend to have higher diet quality with regard to a number of dietary dimensions other than protein sources which could explain why this particular exclusion does not have as pronounces an effect among them.

The Relationship Between Dietary Patterns and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Section I: Index Analysis By Mary M. McGrane and Joan Lyon What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and risk of type 2 diabetes? TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review project was to identify dietary patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Historically, most dietary guidance has been based on research conducted on individual food components or nutri ents. Dietary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between adherence to an a priori score and risk of cardiovascular disease. An a priori score measures the degree of adherence to specific dietary guidelines or adherence to a healthy diet defined by scientific evidence on diet and disease. A priori scores are composite numeric scores of foods, food components, and/or nutrients that are asse ssed as dichotomous variables (with predefined cut -points), ordinal variables such as quintiles, or as continuous variables. The individual components are summed to derive a total score. Conclusion Statement There is limited evidence that adherence to a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals/whole grains, n uts, fish, and unsaturated oils and low in meat and high -fat dairy assessed using an index or score, is associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. (Grade: III -Limited) Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts) , and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns (using an a priori index or score) and risk of obesity. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the review: randomized controlled trials, non -randomized controlled trials, or prospective c ohort studies; subjects aged 2 to 18 years; subjects who were h ealthy or at elevated chronic disease risk; subjects from countries with high or very high human development (2011 Human Development Index); and published in English in peer -reviewed journals. The date range was unlimited. Diet exposure was assessed by adh erence to a hypothesis - based dietary pattern, defined using a numerical scoring system. A group of technical experts were involved in a qualitative synthesis of the body of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the strength o f the evidence (grade) using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the quality, quantity, consistency, magnitude of effect, and generalizability of available evidence. Findings A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review and the body of evidence consisted primarily of large prospective cohort studies. The studies identified two major categories of dietary pattern scores and their association with incident T2D was mixed. Dietary Patterns 172 Mediterranean style dietary pattern: o European studies (Spain and Greece) found a favorable association between a Mediterranean diet and risk of T2D o A study in the United States found no association between a Mediterranean diet and T2D incidence in the total population, in men or women, or in racial/ethnic subgroups Dietary guidelines -related pattern (each study used a different score or index): o Adherence to the alternate HEI (AHEI) was associated with decreased risk of T2D in women in the United Stat es o Adherence to a DASH score was associated with reduced risk of T2D in Whites, but not in the Blacks and Hispanics in the U nited States o Adherence to the DQI -2005 was not associ ated with risk of T2D in young adults in the total population or in Black or White young adults in the United States o European studies ( Australia and Germany) found no association between their dietary guidelines scores and incident T2D Studies that assess ed intermediate outcomes including glucose tolerance and insulin resistance showed there was some agreement that a Mediterranean style diet was protective. Discussion It was challenging to synthesize the results because of the number of indices examined, including MDS, variations on MDS, and a large number of unique dietary guidelines -related scores. Overall, there were not a compelling number of studies with any one in dex. Of the eight studies that examined diabetes incidence, seven different scores were used and only the MDS was used in two studies. Of the five studies that assessed glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, all used different scores. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Is adherence to dietary guidelines or specific dietary patterns, assessed by a predetermined score, related to the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes? In the past, researchers looked at the relationship between individual foods and nutrients and health. Today, there is interest in looking at how combinations of foods and beverages, or dietary patterns, impact health. Many researchers use a score to measure how well individuals follow specific dietary guidance or a healthy diet. These are numeric scores of foods, food components, and/or nutrients and the individual components are summed to derive a total score for a dietary pattern. This summary of a NEL review presents what we know about dietary patterns, assessed using a score, and the likeli hood of developing type 2 diabetes. Conclusion There is limited evidence that adherence to a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals/whole grains, n uts, fish, and unsaturated oils, and low in meat and high -fat dairy, assessed using an index or score, is associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. What the Research Says Among included studies there was variation in the types of indices or scores used, without a preponderance of studies with any one index related to risk of type 2 diabetes, making it difficult to draw overarching conclusions related to a specific dietary pattern In European populations, consumption of a Mediteranean- style diet was associated with reduced incid ence of type 2 diabetes Dietary Patterns 173 EVIDENCE PORTFOLIO Conclusion Statement There is limited evidence that adherence to a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals/whole grains, nuts, fish, and unsaturated oils, and low in meat and red meat and high -fat dairy, assessed using an index or score, is associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. Grade III - Limited Key Findings: Among included studies there was variation in the types of indices or scores used, without a preponderance of studies with any one index related to either r isk of type 2 diabetes or fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance, making it difficult to draw overarching conclusions related to a specific dietary pattern. The different scores showed varied predictability of incident type 2 diabetes: o In European p opulations, adherence to the MDS was associated with reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, among women in a U .S. cohort, the AHEI had similar relationships. o For other scores considered, such as the Total Diet Score, German Food Pyramid Index , DQI -2005, as well as the MDS in a U .S. population, there was no relationship between diet quality and incidence of type 2 diabetes. o One study assessing the DASH score in a U .S. population showed an association in Whites but not in Blacks. A second study showed no association between DQI -2005 and T2D incidence in Black or White young adults. The different scores showed varied association with glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance: o For impaired fasting glucose or in sulin resistance , there was some agreement with the MDS and MSDPS being protective for the measures examined. o There were mixed findings for Total Diet Score, DQI -2005, and an authors' a priori score. For the mixed results, the findings differed by sex, typ e of intermediate outcome examined, and race/ethnicity. Evidence Summary Overview Description of the Evidence A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review on dietary patterns and incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) . The body of evidence consisted primarily of epidemiological studies, with nine prospective cohort studies and two randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In terms of study quality, nine of the studies were of positive quality and two were of neutral quality . The studies were carried out between the years 2006 and 2013. Sample sizes ranged from 187 to 769 subjects for the RCTs and from 822 to as many as 80,029 participants ( 1 study <1,000, 4 studies >1,000, 3 studies >10,000 for the prospective cohort studies .). Study duration ranged from 3 months to 1 year for the RCTs, while the prospective cohort study follow -up times ranged from 4.4 to 20 years. Population: The prospective cohort studies were primary prevention s tudies of general populations; most were conducted with healthy adults who were free of T2D or cardiovascular disease (CVD). The two RCTs were conducted in adults with elevated chronic disease risk: one reported on the Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea (PREDIMED) trial of older adults at increased CVD risk ( Estruch , 2006) ; the other study reported on men with metabolic syndrome (Jacobs , 2009). In prospective cohort studies with adult participants, age ranges spanned from 18 to 84 years. One study focused on young adults with an age range of 18 to 30 years from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA) cohort (Za mora , 2011). One of the st udies examined only women (Fung, 2007) and one study examined only men (Jacobs , 2009). Some studies that examined men and women assessed health outcomes in men and women separately (Abiemo , 2012; von Ruesten, 2010). Three studies specifically identified the race/ethnic subgroups of their cohort. The CARDIA study examined equal numbers of Black and White young adults (Zamora , 2010); the Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) examined Black, Dietary Patterns 174 White, Hispanic , and Chinese adults (Abiemo , 2012); and the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) examined Blacks and Hispanics separately from Whites (Liese, 2009) . Taken together, studies were conducted in the United States , Spain, Norway, Germany, and Australia and included many large, well -characterized cohorts. Five reports were from prospective cohort studies conducted in the U nited States : the CARDIA study ( Zamora , 2010 ), the Framingham Spouse (FOS) study ( Rumawas , 2009) , the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study , , the ( ( Fung , 2007) . Two reports were from studies conducted in Spain: the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Study ( Estruch , 2006) . The remaining reports were from countries represented in only one study: Australia (Blue Mountain Eye Study, Russell , 2012) , Germany (EPIC -Potsdam, von Ruesten, 2010) , and Norway (Oslo Diet and Exercise Study [ODES] , Jacobs , 2009) . Dietary Exposure: Methodologically, diet exposure was assessed by adherence to a hypothesis -based dietary pattern, defined using a numerical scoring system. Two major categories of a priori dietary patterns were identified: (1) a dietary pattern based on a Mediterranean -style diet and ( 2) a dietary pattern based on dietary guidelines recommendations. Only one study examined adherence to a DASH diet and one study used the authors' own a prior i diet score. The most common dietary intake assessment method was the use of food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), which were validated for foods in the respective locations of the study population. Many prospective cohort studies assessed dietary intak e only at baseline. Four studies examined health outcomes related to adherence to a Mediterranean -style dietary pattern. Of these studies, three used the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) of Trichopoulou or a close dietary pattern score (MSDPS) ( Rumawas , 2009) . Four studies examined health outcomes related to adherence to dietary guidelines recommendations based on the United States , German, or Australian dietary guidelines, including the alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) (Fung, 2007) , the Diet Quality Index (DQI) -2005 (Zamora , 2011 the Total Diet Score ( Gopinath , 2013 ), and the German Food Pyramid Index ( von Reusten, 2010 ). One study examined health outcomes related to adherence to a DASH diet ( Liese , 2009) . One study examined health outcomes associated with the authors' own a priori diet scores (Jacobs , 2009) . Qualitative Synthesis of the Collected Evidence Themes and Key Findings Health Outcomes: The studies in this body of evidence examined ( 1) T2D incidence or ( 2) impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance. Type 2 Diabetes Incidence: This category included studies that assessed T2D incidence as the primary outcome of the study ( tables 4-C-I-1 and 4 -C-I-2). Subjects who met the American Diabetes Association or World Health Organization criteria for fasting blood glucose or oral glucose tolerance, or were taking hypoglycemic medication, were considered having incident T2D. Eight studies examined the association between adherence to a dietary pattern and T2D , 2011). The results of prospective cohort studies that examined incident T2D outcomes were mixed. Several studies assessed Mediterranean -style diets. One study conducted in Spain with the Seguimiento Univer sidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort found a favorable association between the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), the original Mediterranean diet score of Trichopoulou , and risk of T2D. Overall, a 2 -point increase in MDS was associated with Dietary Patterns 175 a 35 percent reduction in risk of T2D (Mart\u00ednez -Gonz\u00e1lez, 2008). Another study, conducted in Greece with the EPIC -Greece cohort, also assessed the relatio nship between the MDS and T2D. In this second Mediterranean population, adherence to the MDS was also favorably associated with risk of T2D (Rossi , 2013). Conversely, a study conducted in the United States , using the authors' MedDiet Score with the Multi -Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort found no association between their MedDiet Score and T2D incidence in the total population, in men or women, or in racial/ethnic subgroups (Abiemo , 2012). Taken together, studies in Mediterranean populations that assessed adherence to the traditional MDS found an inverse association with T2D incidence; however , the one study that examined a multi -ethnic U .S. population, found no association. Studies that assessed a dietary guidelines -related pattern were also mixed. In the United States , a study that assessed adherence to the alternate HEI (AHEI) found a favorable association between A HEI score and risk of incident T2D in women in the Nurses' Health Study (Fung, 2007). In a second U .S. cohort, Liese and colleagues found adherence to their DASH score was associated with markedly reduced odds of T2D in Whites in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS), but not in the total population or in the B lack and Hispanic subgroup, ~60 percent of IRAS cohort (Liese , 2009). In a third U .S. cohort in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, there was no associat ion between DQI -2005 score and T2D incidence in the total population or in Blacks or Whites (Zamora , 2011). Lastly, studies in Australia using a Total Diet score in the Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES) and Germany using a German Food Pyramid Index with the EPIC -Potsdam cohort found no association between these scores and incident T2D (Gopinah , 2013; von Ruesten, 2010). The AHEI was predictive of T2D risk in a population of U .S. women, and a DASH score was predictive in Whites, but not Blacks or Hispanics in a U .S. population. With regard to incident T2D, the DQI -2005 was not predictive in that there was no association in the total population, Blacks, or Whites in young adults in the United States . Other studies in Australia and Germany, using dietary guidelin es-related scores found no association between respective scores and incident T2D. Impaired Glucose Tolerance and/or Insulin Resistance: This category included studies that assessed fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, oral glucose tolerance, or insulin resistance using t he Homeostasis Model Assessment -Insulin Resistance (HOMA -IR) equation ( tables 4-C-I-1 and 4- C-I-2). These outcomes were measured by standard clinical and laboratory methods. Five studies examined adherence to a dietary pattern and intermediate outcomes related to glucose tolerance and/or insulin res istance: two RCTs (Estruch , 2006; Jacobs RCTs were conducted in at -risk populations in Europe. An early report from the PREDIMED trial showed that a Mediterranean diet decreased fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA -IR scores in a Spanish population at -risk for CVD (Estruch , 2006). In the Oslo Diet and Exercise Study (ODES), in creased adherence to the authors' a priori diet score resulted in decreased fasting insulin and insulin after a glucose challenge, but not fasting glucose, in Norwegian men with metabolic syndrome ( Jacobs , 2009) . Results from prospective cohort studies were consistent in showing a favorable association between diet score and fasting glucose, fasting i nsulin or HOMA -IR (Rumawas , 2009; Zamora , 2011) with the exception of one study that found the association with fasting glucose only in men ( Gopinath , 2013) . It is difficult to assess food components across these studies, as numerous different scores were used, without a compelling number of studies using any one score or index. Qualitative Assessment of the Collected Evidence Quality and Quantity Quality assessment of the studies included in this systematic review involved determining the validity of each study by examining the scientific soundness of study design and execution, as well as the risk of bias in the findings related to outcomes. The preponder ance of the evidence consisted of positive quality studies (9 out of 11 studies). In terms o f quantity of studies, there were a moderate number of studies with varied results in T2D outcomes. Dietary Patterns 176 Consistency When comparing across the large well -characterized cohorts for incident T2D, the findings were mixed. There were no significant findings from the CARDIA or MESA studies; mixed findings from the IRAS cohort, although a notable T2D risk reduction in Whites; and some protective findings fr om Nurses' Health S tudy (NHS). Overall, it was challenging to synthesize the results because of the number of indices examined, including MDS, variations on MDS, and a large number of unique dietary guidelines -related scores. Overall, there were not a compelling number of studies with any one index. Of the eight studies that examined diabetes incidence, seven different scores were used and only the MDS was used in two studies. Of the five studies that assessed glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, all used different scores. Impact This body of evidence directly addressed the exposures and health outcomes of interest for the systematic review; eight studies measured the endpoint outcome, incident T2D. When associations were found between a dietary pattern and incident T2D, th ey were clinically meaningful. However, a number of the included studies did not find association. Generalizability/External Validity Overall, the prospective cohort studies on incident T2D were from large, well -characterized cohorts from the Un ited States and Europe, so potentially generalizable if the findings had been consistent. The two RCTs were conducted with at -risk subjects, therefore, not generalizable to the healthy U .S. population, but relevant to the la rge at -risk population in the Un ited States . Limitations of the Evidence For several of the studied indices, there was only one analysi s, including for the Total Diet Score, German Food Pyramid In dex, DQI -2005, AHEI, and DASH. Mediterranean -style scores were the only dietary pattern measures/indices used in more than one study. It was a challenge to compare results across the studies because some of the scores were not validated and used different diet assessment tools. Furthermore, the number of study participants and number of type 2 diabetes cases varied widely. Additionally, sample size was cited by authors who examined racial/ethnic subgroups as a potential limitation in their ability to detect significant associations related to incident T2D in the MESA, CARDIA, and IRAS cohorts. Research Recommendations Overall, there is a need for more coordinated studies involving multiple U .S. cohorts, all of which examine the same scores or indices assessed in a standardized way. In addition, more analysi s of key sub population groups, with sufficient sample sizes, would further inform policy in this area.

Dietary Patterns 182 Section I I: Factor and Cluster Analysis By Patricia C. MacNeil and Joanne M. Spahn Are prevailing patterns of diet behavior in a population, assessed using factor or cluster analysis, related to risk of type 2 diabetes? TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review project is to identify patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Historically, most dietary guidance has been based on research conducted on individual food components or nutrients. Die tary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Factor and cluster analysis allow examination of the relationship between prevailing dietary patterns of a population and out comes of public health concern. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between patterns of food and beverage intake identified using factor and cluster analysis, and risk for type 2 diabetes. Conclusion Statement Limited and inconsistent evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that in adults, dietary patterns derived using factor or cluster analysis, characterized by vegetables, fruits, and low -fat dairy products tend to have an association with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes , and those patter ns characterized by red meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , French fries, refined grains , and high -fat dairy products tended to show an increased association for risk of type 2 diabetes. Among studies , there was substantial variation in food group components and not all studies with similar patterns showed significant association (Grade: III-Limited). Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSI S, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts) , and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns defined using factor or cluster analysis and risk of type 2 diabetes. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the review: Human subjects; A ges: 2 years and older; Populations: Healthy and those with elevated chronic disease risk; subjects from countries with high or very high human development (based on the 2011 Human Development Index); randomized controlled trials, non -randomized controlled trials, or quasi- experimental studies; Sample size: Minimum of 30 subjects per study arm; Dropout rate less than 20 percent ; Study assesses dietary intake using factor and cluster analysis; study considered type 2 diabetes and risks of type 2 diabetes; published in English in a peer -reviewed journal. The date range for the conduct of studies was unlimited. The results of each included study were summarized in evidence worksheets (including a study quality rating) and evidence table. A group of subject mat ter experts were involved in a qualitative synthesis of the body of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the strength of the evidence (grade) using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the quality, quantity , consis tency , magnitude of effect , and generalizability of available evidence. Dietary Patterns 183 Findings Twelve prospective cohort studies examined dietary patterns and their association with T2D incidence. Eleven studies used factor analysis and one used cluster analyses to identify a total of 33 diverse dietary patterns. Studies ranged in size from 690 to 75,512 subj ects, were conducted in the United States (five), Japan (two), the Netherlands, Australia, Finland, China, and the United Kingdom, and ranged in duration fro m 4 to 23 years. o Dietary patterns associated with lower risk of T2D were characterized by vege tables, fruits, low -fat dairy, and whole grains and those associated with increased risk of T2D were characterized by red meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , French fries, refined grains , and high -fat dairy products. Three prospective cohort studies assessed the association between dietary patterns derived using cluster analysis and factor analysis and plasma glucose levels. Studies ranged in size from 1,146 to 5,824 subje cts and were conducted in the United States (two studies) and Denmark. o Studies focused on intermediate outcomes were too few an d too diverse in methodology to develop a conclusion. Discussion The ability to draw strong conclusions was limited due to the following issues: Variations in methodology, the number and type of food groupings (e.g. , vegetables grouped together or in different groups, regional food groupings), definitions , and naming conventions found in the review make analysis challenging. Diet assessment methodology may not accurately capture important elements of the diet . Most longitudinal studies include only baseline measure of dietary intake and do not account for changes in subject s' diets , availability and variations in the food supply. Patterns derived from factor or cluster analysis represent the prevailing dietary patterns of a specific population and are therefore not generalizable and do not represent the opt imal diet to protect against disease. However, studies in this review identify characteristics of dietary patterns actually consumed, which are associated with increased and decreased incidence of type 2 diabetes. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Are the amounts, types, variety , or combinations of foods and beverages people frequently eat and drink related to the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes? In the past, researchers looked at the relationship between individual foods and nutrients and health. Today, there is interest in looking at how combinations of foods and beverages, or dietary patterns, impact health. Statistical methods called factor and cluster analyses can be used to describe the patterns of foods and beverages people eat. This summary of a NEL review presents what we know about dietary patterns of certain groups of people described using factor and cluster analysis and the likelihood o f developing type 2 diabetes. Conclusion Limited and inconsistent evidence from epidemiological studies examining dietary patterns derived using factor or cluster analysis in adults found that consumption of a dietary pattern characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains , and reduced -fat dairy products tends to be associated with more favorable body weight status over time than consumption of a dietary pattern characterized by red meat, processed meats, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, and refined grains. Dietary Patterns 184 What the Research Says Results the from the twelve studies included in this review tell us that dietary patterns high in vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy products, and whole grains may prevent people from getting type 2 diabetes. These studies also show that dietary patterns high in red meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , French fries, refined grains, and high -fat dairy products tend to increase people's risk of getting type 2 diabetes. This review raised some key issues that make it harder to make stronger recommendations: o There were many differences in how the studies were done. o The dietary patterns differed a lot between studies. EVIDENCE PORTFOLIO Conclusion Statement Limited and inconsistent evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that in adults, dietary patterns derived using factor or cluster analysis, characterized by vegetables, fruits, and low -fat dairy products tend to have an association with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and those patterns characterized by red meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , French fries, refined grains , and high -fat dairy products tended to show an increased association for risk of type 2 diabetes. Among studies , there was substantial variation in food group components and not all studies with similar patterns showed significant association. Grade III- Limited Key Findings Cluster and factor analyses are data- driven approaches that describe the dietary patterns consumed by the study population. High variability in the studies included in this review, including populations, case number, sample size, dietary assessment techniques, methods used to define and retain factors and clusters, confounders considered and th e statistical analysis employed, made comparisons among studies challenging. Studies focused on intermediate outcomes were too few and too diverse in methodology to draw a conclusion. Evidence Summary Overview Description of the Evidence Factor and cluster analyses are data- driven approaches that empirically derive food intake patterns (appendix A) . Fifteen prospective cohort studies conducted betwee n 2004 and 2012 were included. Seven studies received a positive quality and e ight a neutral quality r ating. Sample sizes ranged from 690 to 75,512 participants (2 studies <2,000; 6 studies 3,000 to 6,500; 4 with 20,000 to 45,000; and 3 studies with > 65,000 subjects). Study duration ranged from 4 to 23 years (6 <10 years; 7 between 10 to 15 years; and 2 >15 years). Eight studies were conducted in the United States and two in Japan, while the remaining were conducted in Australia, Finland, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom . Population: Eleven studies were conducted in both men of these studies analyzed health outcomes by gender (Erber Kimokoti , 2012; Malik , 2012), and one study included U.S. men only (Van Dam , 2002). Age range at baselin e spanned from 18 to 84 years. F ourteen studies analyzed middle -aged and older populations (above 35 years ), and one study analyzed young adults 18 to 30 ye ars at baseline (Duffey , 2012). Three studies identified race/ethnic subgroups within ort (Erber, 2009; Hodge , 2007; Nettleton , 2008). Dietary Patterns 185 Dietary Pattern Methodology : Thirteen of fifteen studies assessed dietary intake using a baseline food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and two studies from the Nurses' Health Study aggregated data from FFQs completed at four separate time points (Fung , 2004; Malik , 2012). Two studies u sed a diet h istory approach (Duffey , 2012; Montonen, 2005). In general, individual food and beverage items were consolidated into food groups based on established criteria, and dietary patterns were then generated using factor analysis in 12 studies (Bauer , 2012; Erber, , 2002; Yu, 2011), erns were defined using factor analysis, pattern scores were calculated for each participant and after multivariate adjustment, the association between dietary pattern scores and type 2 diabetes risks by quintile or quartile were assessed. Generally, studi es adjusted for baseline BMI, total energy intake, physical activity, sex, age, and smoking, but additional factors were considered by individual studies. Only Nettleton et al. (2008) controlled for change in body weight or waist circumference over the course of the study. When cluster analysis was used, a reference group was defined and analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between cluster group and risk of T2D. Outcomes: The studies in this body of evidence evaluated associations between dietary patterns and endpoint outcomes and intermediate outcomes. Endpoint Outcome: Twelve studies evaluated the association between dietary patterns and incidence of T2D. O nly one of these studies used cluster analysis to define dietary pattern s (Brunner , 2008). Factor and cluster name reflect those assigned by the author, followed by food components characteristic of the pattern. Intermediate Outcome: One study measured fasting blood glucose with a cutoff of 6.1 mmol/L (Duffey , 2012); another study measured pl asma glucose with a cutoff of 5.1 mmol/L (Kimokoti , 2012), while a third study measured plasma glucose after an overnight fast and after a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (Lau , 2009). Table 2 provides a general overview of the study characteristics, dietary assessment methods, dietary patterns identified using factor and cluster analysis , and their association with plasma glucose levels. Factor and cluster name reflect those assigned by the author, followed by food components characteristic of the pattern. Themes T2D incidence: Twelve prospective cohort studies examined dietary patterns and their association with T2D incidence (table 4 -C-II-1). Eleven studies used factor analysis and one used cluster analyses to identify one to four dietary patterns per study and a total of 35 diverse dietary pattern s within the body of evidence. Studies ranged in size from 690 to 75,512 subj ects, were conducted in the United States (five), Japan (two), the Netherlands, Australia, Finland, China , and the United Kingdom, and ranged in duration from 4 to 23 years. Results were mixed. There were many null findings, pa rticularly among studies with duration of less than 7 years associated with lower risk of T2D were characterized by vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy products, and whole grains , and those associated with increased ris k of T2D were characterized by red meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , French fries, refined grains , and high -fat dairy products. However, there was substantial variation in the food groups identified, even among patterns with the same name. Intermediate outcomes: Three prospective cohort studies assessed the association between di etary patterns and plasma glucose levels (table 4 -C-II-2). Two U .S. studies derived patterns using cluster analysis (Duffy , 2012; Kimokoti , 2012) and one study conducted in Denmark used factor analysis (Lau , 2009). Studies ranged in size from 1,146 to 5,824 adults. Duffey et al . (2012) identified diet clusters : \"Prudent Diet\" and \"Western Diet\"; Kimokoti et al. (2012) identified five clusters : \"Heart Healthier ,\" \"Lighter Eating ,\" \"Wine and Moderate Eating ,\" \"Higher Fat,\" and \"Empty Calories\"; and Lau et al . (2009) derived two factors : \"Modern\" and \"Traditional .\" Variations in population, die tary assessment methodologies, and methods used to derive patterns resulted in a highly variable set of dietary patterns, making it difficult to draw concl usions. No association with fasting plasma glucose was found with any of the nine dietary patterns identified. Lau ( 2009) assessed 2 -hour plasma glucose concentration and found a dietary pattern characterized by high intake of vegetables, fruit, mixed vegetable dishes, vegetable oil and vinegar dressing, poultry, pasta, rice , and cereals associated with decreased T2D risk.

Six studies were found to be of positive quality, and six rece ived a neutral quality rating . Studies ranged in size from 690 to 75,512 subjects. Three prospective cohort studies with 1,146 to 5,824 subjects evaluated the association between dietary patterns and intermediate outcomes, specifically fasting plasma glucose. Fasting plasma glucose criteria varied between studies and only one study (Lau, 2009) measured post -challenge 2 -hour plasma glucose, in addition to a fasting measure. Consistency Among studies that showed significant associations, there were substantial variations in food group c omponents and not all studies with similar patterns showed significant associations. There were many null findings, particularly among shorter studies (less than 7 years). In general, dietary patterns derived using factor or cluster analysis, characterized by vegetables, fruits, and low -fat dairy products tended to have an association with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes , and those patterns characterized by red meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , French fries, refined grains , and high -fat dairy produc ts tended to show an increased association for risk of type 2 diabetes in adults. Impact It is challenging to infer public health implications from these studies, since the results from cluster analysis and factor analysis are based on a specific population and hard to translate into detailed dietary prescriptions, aside from broad generalizations. Results were clinically meaningful for associations made between factors and clusters and incidence of T2D. The methodologies used in the included studi es varied substantially. Patterns using the same naming convention may contain very dif ferent foods or groups of foods (e.g., a pattern labeled \"prudent\" may or may not contain fish, nuts, legumes, whole grains, poultry , or low -fat dairy products ). Variati ons in the number of study subjects, cases , and subjective decisions involved in deriving and retaining factors and clusters for analysis likely influence the ability to detect associations. Generalizability/External Validity Studies recruited adult populations, and both men and women were well represented. Eight of twelve studies assessing T2D inciden ce were conducted outside the United States and one of three assessing intermediate outcomes. The majority of studies includ ed W hite populations. Ethnic ity and socioeconomic status were often not reported in analyses. Limitations of the Evidence Variation in methodology used to derive and analyze dietary patterns ( e.g., factor versus cluster analysis, subjective decisions regarding groupings of foods, number of patterns retained and naming conventions, population characteristics, sample size and case numbers ) make the analysis challenging. Even factors with the same naming convention (e.g., \"vegetable\" or \"prudent\" ) included somewhat different foods or groups of foods. Patterns derived from either factor or cluster analysis may not be reproducible because of variations in populations, sample sizes, dietary assessment methods, and decisions made to define food variables used in factor and cluster analysi s, and factors and clusters differ across studies. Differences in the statistical analysis approaches used to derive and retain factors and clusters influences power and the ability to detect an association. Patterns derive d from factor analysis and clust er analy ses were analyzed differently. In factor analysis, \"high\" scores were generally compared with \"low\" sco res of the same pattern, though it was not clear what characteristic differences there were in a \"high\" versus \"low\" score factor. In cluster ana lysis, one cluster was compared with another one, making it difficult to interpret results together. Dietary patterns with significant association should not be construed as the best or worst possible diet associated with diabetes risk. Dietary Patterns 194 Most longitudinal studies included only baseline measure of dietary intake and did not account for changes in subject's diets, availability , and variations in the food supply, which may have influenced the food components of patterns. Food frequency questionnaires may not a ccurately capture important elements of the diet. Research Recommendations Evaluate and standardize methods used to assess, organize, aggregate, and adjust food variables to facilitate interpretation of findings across studies. Additional research is needed to examine if and how gender, age, SES , and ethnicity might influence the relationship between dietary patterns and risk for T2D. Consider important confounde rs that may modify or explain the association between dietary intake and T2D, for example w eight change. REFERENCES 1.

Obaggy What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using reduced rank regression analysis, and risk of t ype 2 d iabetes? TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review project is to identify patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Historically, most dietary guidance has been based on research conducted on individual food components or nutrients. Dietary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Reduced rank regression (RRR) is a statistical method that determines dietary patterns (combinations of food intake) that explain as much variation as possible among a set of response variables related to a health outcome of interest. It is an a posterior i method since it uses both existing evidence and exploratory statistics . The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between patterns of food and beverage intake identified using reduced rank regression, and risk for type 2 diab etes. Conclusion Statement There is insufficient evidence, due to a small number of studies, to examine the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and risk of type 2 diabetes. The differences in the methods used and populations studied made it difficult to compare results, and therefore no conclusions were drawn. (Grade: Not Assignable) Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts) , and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regress ion analysis and risk of type 2 diabetes. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the review: Human subjects; Ages: 2 years and older; Populations: Healthy and those with elevated chronic disease risk; individuals with chronic disease; published in English in a peer -reviewed journal; Sample size: Minimum of 30 subjects per study arm; Dropout rate L ess than 20 percent ; Study assesses dietary intake using reduced rank regression analysis; study considered diabetes and risks of diabetes.; subjects from countries with high or very high human development (based on the 2011 Human Development Index). The d ate range for the conduct of the studies was unlimited. The results of each included study were summarized in evidence worksheets (including a study quality rating) and evidence table. A group of subject matter experts were involved in a qualitative synth esis of the body of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the strength of the evidence (grade) using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the quality, quantity and consistency, magnitude of effect and generalizability of available evidence. Dietary Patterns 197 Findings Three prospective cohort studies examined dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression analysis and their association with T2D incidence. The studies ranged in size from 880 to 6,699 subjects, and two of the s tudies were conducted in the United States and one in the United Kingdom and ranged in duration from 5.2 to 11.6 years. Comparison across studies was limited by the small number of studies, differences in methodology, and in the populations studi ed. Therefore no conclusions were drawn. Discussion The ability to draw a gradable conclusion was limited due to the following issues: All three studies used different types of biomarkers as response variables , such as PAI -1 HOMA -IR index; and BMI, fasting glucose, TG, HDL, and hypertension, making it difficult to make comparisons across these studies. The dietary patterns derived in each of these studies were directly linked to the response vari ables selected; therefore, the variation in the response variables used suggest that the resulting dietary patterns may not be comparable. There were variations in dietary assessment methods used to assess dietary intake, as well as the food groupings using in the analyses across the studies. These methodological differences make it difficult to compare the resulting dietary patterns across studies and to determine how these differences may have contributed to differences in relationships between the patter ns and type 2 diabetes risks. The studies were not consistent in their use of confounders in the analyses. For example, alcohol intake was not included as a confounder in one study, and alcohol, BMI, and smoking status were not controlled for in another study. There was a positive association between derived dietary patterns that included meat intake and incident T2D in the two studies that used biomarkers as response variables, though the definitions of meat differed. However, because there were so few s tudies available, variability in the methodology used and different populations considered, there was insufficient information from which to assess consistency or draw conclusions about the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank r egression and risk of type 2 diabetes. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Are the amounts, types, variety , or combinations of foods and beverages people frequently eat and drink related to the likelihood of developing type 2 d iabetes? In the past, researchers looked at the relationship between individual foods and nutrients and health. Today, there is interest in looking at how combinations of foods and beverages intake, or dietary patterns, influence health by applying different scient ific methods. A statistical method called reduced rank regression analysis can be used to describe the patterns of foods and beverages people eat based on a set of \"response variables\" that are known to be related to the health outcome of interest. This su mmary of a NEL review presents what research evidence currently exist when reduced rank regression analysis is the method used to study the dietary patterns of groups of people and their likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. Conclusion There is insufficient evidence, due to a small number of studies, to examine the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and risk of type 2 diabetes. The differences in the methods used and populations studied made it di fficult to compare results, and therefore no conclusions were drawn. Dietary Patterns 198 What the Research Says Three studies looked at dietary patterns found using reduced rank regression analysis and the risk of getting type 2 diabetes . However, these studies had some k ey issues that make it hard to make any recommendations: There were few studies available. There were many differences in how the studies were done. The populations studied were different between studies. EVIDENCE PORTFOLIO Conclusion Statement There is insufficient evidence, due to a small number of studies, to examine the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and risk of type 2 diabetes. The differences in the methods used and populations studied made it difficult to compare results, and therefore no conclusions were drawn. Grade IV - Not Assignable Key Findings: The three positive quality prospective cohort studies included in this review used reduced rank regression ( see appendix A ) analysis to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Comparison across studies was limited by the small number of studies, differences in methodology, and in the populations studied. Therefore , no conclusions were drawn. Evidence S ummary Overview Description of the Evidence Three prospective cohort studies that used RRR to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and T2D were included in this systematic review (L iese, 2009; , 2008; Imamura , 2009). All of the studi es were rated positive quality. Two of the s tudies were conducted in the USA and one in the United Kingdom. The s ample sizes were 880 for Liese (2009), 2,879 for Imamura (2009), and 6,699 for McNaughton (2008) . All three studies were conducted in adults, i ncluded females and males, used validated food frequency questionnaires to assess dietary intake, and included incidence of T2D as the primary study outcome. The independent variables in these studies were dietary pattern scores and biomarkers used as response v ariables in two of the studies. The response variables used and the respective dietary patterns extracted for each study are described in more detail below. Evidence Summary Paragraphs Liese 2009 (positive quality) used plasminogen activator Inhibitor -I (PAI- 1) and fibrinogen as response variables. One dietary pattern was extracted that was characterized by high intake of red meats, low -fiber bread and cereal, dried beans, fried potatoes, tomato vegetables, eggs, cheese, and cottage cheese and low intake of wine. Red meat and low -fiber bread/cereal explained 19.3 percent and 18.1 percent , respectively, of the variation in the pattern score. Taken together, all nine food groups within the pattern explained 72 .8 percent of food pattern score vari ation. McNaughton 2008 (positive quality) used Homeostasis Model assessment of Insulin resistance index (HOMA -IR index) as the response variable. One dietary pattern was extracted that was characterized by high consumption of low-calorie/diet soft drinks , onions, sugar -sweetened beverages, burgers and sausages, crisps and other snacks, and Dietary Patterns 199 white bread; and low consumption of medium -/high- fiber breakfast cereals, jam, French dressing/vinaigrette, and whole meal bread. The extracted dietary pattern explaine d 5.7 percent of the variation in HOMA -IR, and the 10 food items with factor loadings >0.2 explained 66.5 percent of the variation in the dietary pattern score. Imamura 2009 (positive quality) conducted confirmatory and exploratory analyses to compare int ernally and externally derived dietary patterns on the incidence of T2D using data from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Potsdam Study (EPIC), Whitehall II Study (WS). Response variables were: : -IR. For the exploratory analyses, three RRR analyses were done within the FOS cohort using BMI, fasting glucose, triglycerides (TG), HDL cholesterol, and hy pertension as response variables and each food grouping of the NHS, EPIC, a nd WS cohorts was applied. All three exploratory scores had similar positive contributions (increased risk; meat, processed meat, eggs, margarine, fried products, refined grains, an d caloric/noncaloric soft drinks), but the negative contributors (decreased risk) differed (with the exceptions of tea and whole grains).

DP derived from EPIC and WS were less predictive. Dietary Patterns 201 Assessment of the Body of Evidence: This review included three positive -quality prospective cohort studies. There was a positive association between dietary patterns that included meat intake and incident T2D in the two studies (Liese , 2009 ; McNaughton , 2008) that used biomarkers as response variables, though the definitions of meat differed. However, because there were so few studies available, variability in the methodology used and different populations considered, there was insufficient information from which to assess consistency or draw conclusions about the relationship between dietary patterns derived using RRR and risk of T2D. Limitations of the Evidence Methodological Differences: All of the studies used different types of biomarkers as response variables , such as PAI -1 HOMA -IR index; and BMI, fasting glucose, TG, HDL, and hypertension, making it difficult to make comparisons across these studies. The dietary patterns described in each of these studies were directly linked to the response variables selected; therefore, the variation in the response variables used suggest that the resulting dietary patterns may not be comparable. There were variations in dietary assessment methods used to assess dietary intake, as well as the food groupings used in the analyses across the studies. For example, Liese ( 2009 ) used a 114- item validated semi -quantitative FFQ, created 33 food groups on the basis of similarities in food and nutrient composition, and queried alcoholic beverages separately. McNaughton ( 2008) used a 127 -item validated FFQ and the food and beverage items were aggregated into 71 groups on the basis of nutrient content, cooking , and preparation methods. Imamura 2009 used a 126- item validated semi -quantitative FFQ (FOS) and used food groupings from previous studies to each RRR -derived dietary pattern and applied to the FOS data to create three different sets of food groups used in their analyses. These methodological differences make it difficult to compare the resulting dietary patterns across studies and to determine how these differences may have contributed to differences in relationships between the patterns and type 2 diabetes risks. The studies were not consistent in their use of confounders in the analyses. For example, as compared to McNaughton (2008) , alcohol intake was not included as a confounder in the analyses by Liese ( 2009 ), and alcohol, BMI, and smoking status were not include d as confounders by Imamura ( 2009) . Population Differences: Two of the s tudies were conducted in t he United States and one in the United Kingdom and represented populations in different regions of the world, which limited the ability to compare and interpret the results due to potential differences in dietary patterns between these regions. Research R ecommendations More research using reduced rank regression analyses should be conducted to investigate the relationship between dietary patterns and type 2 diabetes, particularly among U .S.-based populations, and including both intermediate outcomes (gluco se intolerance, insulin resistance), as well as incidence of disease. Additionally, standardization in methodology, such as response variables and food groupings used, are also needed. Dietary Patterns 202 REFERENCES 1. Liese AD, Weis KE, Schulz M, Tooze JA.

McGrane What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/ recommendations or specific dietary patterns (assessed using methods other than index/score, cluster or factor, or reduced rank regression analyses) and risk of type 2 diabetes? TECHNICAL A BSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review project is to identify patterns of food and beverage intake that promote health and prevent disease. Historically, most dietary guidance has been based on research conducted on individual food compone nts or nutrients. Dietary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Different methods of anal yses are used to assess dietary patterns including index or score, cluster or factor, reduced rank regression, in addition to other methods, to exam ine the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns of a population and outcomes of public health concern. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between patterns of food and beverage intake identified using methods other than index or score, factor or cluster, or reduced rank analyses, and risk of type 2 diabetes. Conclusion Statement There is insufficient evidence on a relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean -style or vegetarian diet pattern and incidence of type 2 diabetes. There is limited, inconsistent evidence that adherence to a Mediterranean - style, DASH or modified DASH, or Nordic dietary pattern results in improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. ( Grade IV -Not Assignable - Incidence of type 2 diabetes; Grade: III- Limited -Glucose tolerance and insulin resistance ) Methods Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase, Navigator (BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts) , and Cochrane databases to identify studies that evaluated the association between dietary patterns defined using methods other than index factor or cluster analysis and body weight status. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the review: conducted in subjects aged 2 to 18 years; randomized controlled trials, non -randomiz ed controlled trials, or quasi- experimental studies; subjects from countries with high or very high human development (based on the 2011 Human Development Index); subjects who were healthy or at elevated chronic disease risk; published in English in a peer -reviewed journal. The date range was unlimited. The results of each included study were summarized in evidence worksheets (including a study quality rating) and an evidence table. A group of subject matter experts were involved in a qualitative synthesis of the body of evidence, development of a conclusion statement, and assessment of the strength of the evidence (grade) using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the quality, quantity, consistency, magnitude of effect , and generalizability of available evidence. Findings Four types of dietary patterns were identified using other methods of assessing dietary exposure related to type 2 diabetes risk: ( 1) a Mediterranean -style pattern, ( 2) a DASH or modified DASH pattern, (3) a vegetarian patte rn, and ( 4) a Nordic pattern. Dietary Patterns 204 Overall, there were too few articles and the dietary patterns and study characteristics were too varied to compare across studies. A favorable association was found in a Mediterranean -style diet combined with olive oil and/or nuts, and in a vegetarian diet compared to a non -vegetarian diet with incidence of type 2 diabetes higher in Black versus non - Blacks. Five out of e ight studies were conducted out side of the United States with only three out of eight articles reporte d race/ethnicity and, of those, only one study reported results based on race/ethnicity. Limitations of the studies include: o All of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included different at- risk populations. o Too few articles examined a relationship between dietary patterns and the endpoint outcome of incident type 2 diabetes to draw a conclusion, although the two patterns studied (one Mediterranean -style and one vegetarian) showed a favorable effect. o Too few articles assessed the intermediate outcom es of impaired glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance. The results related to impaired glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance were too mixed to identify a consistent pattern. Discussion It is difficult to synthesize the results from the studies in this review because there were too few studies and they examined different dietary patterns or patterns that were operationalized differently. The studies included a predominantly Caucasian population with varied baseline health status. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Are the amounts, types, variety or combinations of foods and beverages people frequently eat and drink related to the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes? In the past, researchers looked at the relationship between individual foods and nutrients and health. Today, there is interest in looking at how combinations of foods and beverages, or dietary patterns, impact health. This summary of a NEL review presents what we know about different healthy eating patterns and the amounts, variety or combination of different foods and drinks, and how often they are eaten may affect body weight. Conclusion There is insufficient evidence on a relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean -style or vegetarian diet pattern and incidence of type 2 diabetes. There is limited, inconsistent evidence that adherence to a Mediterranean - style, DASH or modified DASH, or Nordic dietary pattern results in improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. What the Research Says Four types of dietary patterns were identified using other methods to measure how well participants followed a specific pattern and relate it to risk of getting type 2 diabetes: ( 1) a Mediterranean -style pattern, ( 2) a DASH or modified DASH pattern, ( 3) a vegetarian pattern, and ( 4) a Nordic pattern. Overall, there were too few studies, too many different dietary patterns, and the study components were too different to compare the results across studies. A reduced chance of getting type 2 diabetes was found in a Mediterranean -style diet combined with olive oil and/or nuts, and in a vegetarian diet compared to a non -vegetarian diet where Black participants had a higher rate of type 2 diabetes than non -Blacks. Five out of eight studies were done out side of the United States . Only three out of eight articles reported the race/ethnicity of the participants and, of those, only one study showed results based on race/ethnicity. Limitations of the studies include: o All of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included participants with different health issues. Dietary Patterns 205 o Too few studies looked at dietary patterns and the incidence of type 2 diabetes to be able to say whether a specific pattern or patterns protect against getting type 2 diabetes. However, two patterns studied (one Mediterranean -style and one vegetarian) showed a reduced chance of getting type 2 diabetes. o Too few studies looked at impaired glucose tolerance and/or insulin r esistance that affect risk of type 2 diabetes, and the results were too different to identify a consistent pattern. o It is difficult to list the specific foods and beverages because there were too few studies looking at several different patterns that were defined differently. EVIDENCE PORTFOLIO Conclusion Statement There is insufficient evidence on a relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean -style or vegetarian diet pattern and incidence of type 2 diabetes. There is limited, inconsistent evidence that adherence to a Mediterranean - style, DASH or modified DASH, or Nordic dietary pattern results in improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Grade IV-Not Assignable - Incidence of type 2 diabetes; III -Limited -Glucose tolerance and insulin resistance Key Findings: Four types of dietary patterns were identified using other methods of assessing dietary exposure re lated to type 2 diabetes risk: ( 1) a Mediterranean -style pattern, ( 2) a DASH or modified DASH pattern, (3) a vegetarian pattern, and ( 4) a Nordic pattern.

Dietary Patterns 206 Evidence Summary Overview Description of the Evidence A total of eight articles met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review on dietary patterns and incident type 2 diabetes outcomes assessed using methods other than index/score, cluster or factor, or reduced rank regression analyses. The body of evidence examined seven studies (two articles on PREDIME D) consisti one PCS (PCS) (Tonstad , 2013). In terms of study quality, seven of the eight articles received a positive quality rating and one was rated neutral (Tonstad , 2013). The studies were carried out between 2004 and 2013. Two studies were conducted in the United States; one in the Uni ted States and Canada; one in Spain (2 PREDIMED articles); and one each in Greece, Italy, and Sweden. The sample sizes of the RCTs ranged from 82 to 1,224 participants and the PCS had a sample size of 41,387 participants (in total, 2 studies <100; 3 studie s >100; 1 study >400; 1 study >1,000; and 1 study >40,000). All eight studies were conducted in adults. RCT duration ranged from 6 weeks to a median of 4 years and the PCS duration was 2 years (in total, 5 studies < 1 year, 2 studies < 2 years, and 1 study > 3 years). Population: The RCTs were primary prevention studies of at -risk subjects. Baseline health status in these subjects included subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia (Adamsson , ith abdominal obesity (Rallidis , 2009); and subjects with three or more CVD risk factors, including metabolic syndrome (Salas -Salvado , 2008 and 2011). The PCS subjects were non -diabetic individu als in the Adventist Health Study (Tonstad , 2013). The mean age in six of the studies was between 44 and 67 years and the age of participants in one study ranged from 25 to 65 years (Adamsson , 2011). Female participation in the seve n studies was between 45 and 67 percent . Race or ethnicity was not reported in the three studies that looked at a Med iterranean -style diet Salvado , 2008 and 2011) and one study examining the Nordic diet ( Adamsson , 2011). Three studies that looked at either at the DASH diet or variation of the DASH diet (Blumenthal, 2010; Gadgil , 2013) or a vegetarian diet (Tonstad , 2013) had a representative Black s ubgroup which accounted for 17 to 55 percent of the study populatio n. Dietary Exposure: Four of the seven studies (all RCTs) examined a Mediterranean -style dietary pattern or variation of one. One study looked at the Mediterranean -style diet with addition of either olive oil or nuts compared to a control, low -fat diet in the PREDIMED trial of subjects at risk for CVD (Salas -Salvado , 2008 and 2011). One study looked at the Mediterranean -style diet versus a \"Prudent\" diet as control in subjects wi th metabolic syndrome (Esposito , 2004) and one study looked at a Greek Medit erranean diet in subjects w ith abdominal obesity (Rallidis , 2009). The other three RCTs looked at either a variation of the DA SH dietary patte rn (Blumenthal , 2010 [ENCORE]; the Nordic diet (Adamsson , 2011). The PCS looked at vegetarian patterns, including vegan, lacto -ovo vegetarian, pesco vegetaria n, and semi -vegetarian (Tonstad , 2013). Table 1 provides an overview of the study characteristics, a description of the dietary patterns examined, and the results as intermediate and endpoint outcomes. Dietary Assessment: Dietary intake in this review was assessed using a variety of methods, including food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), diet adherence questionnaires, dietary history interviews, 24 -hour re calls, and food records, diaries, and checklists. Four of the seven studies used a FFQ to assess dietary intake in addition to other assessment methods. In the PREDIMED trial, a 137 -item validated FFQ and a 14 -item validated questionnaire on adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet were used (Salas -Salvado , 2008 and 2011). In the ENCORE trial, a self -reported FFQ (4 -week recall) and 4 -day f ood diary were used (Blumenthal , 2010). The on ly PCS in this review, Tonstad ( 2013) , used a validated FFQ of 130 commonly consumed food/food groups and included a write -in option. The FFQ was developed specifically for the study population. Dietary Patterns 207 Other methods of assessing dietary intake include d weekly diet diaries (Esposito , 2004); 3- day food diaries, 24- hour recalls, check list of foods consumed daily, and the return o f empty food packages (Rallidis , 2009); and diet history interviews by trained dieticians before baseline and after 6 weeks with self -reported daily checklists to record deviations from the menu (Adamsson , 2011). Gadgil (2013) provided all meals and snacks to subjects who were also asked to limit alcohol consumption to usual patterns. Qualitative Synthesis of the Collected Evidence Themes and Key Findings Health Outcomes: The eight articles in this review examined ( 1) type 2 diabetes incidence or ( 2) impaired glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance. Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Studies that examined incidence of type 2 diabetes as the primary outcome w ere included in t his category (t able 1). Subjects who met the American Diabetes Association or World Health Organization criteria for fasting blood glucose or oral glucose tolerance, or were taking hypoglycemic medication, were considered having incident type 2 diabetes. Two studies examined the association between adherence to a dietary pattern and incidence of type 2 diabetes (Salas -Salvados , 2011; Tonstad , 2013). Although the results of both studies showed a favorable association between either a Mediterranean -style or a vegetarian dietary pattern and incidence of type 2 diabetes, the studies differed in design and dietary pattern used to assess diet exposure. In th e PREDIMED trial, Salas -Salvado (2011) compared adherence to a Mediterranean -style diet with a low -fat diet (<35 percent fat) in subjects with three or more CVD risk factors in Spain. The Mediterranean -style diet included the provision of olive oil or nuts to the two treatment groups, and both groups showed decreased incidence of type 2 diabetes compared to the control low -fat group. In a PCS, Tonstad (2013 ) compared a vegetarian diet with a non -vegetarian diet in non -diabetic subjects in the United States and Canada (Adventist Health Study- 2). In addition to a favorable association among vegetarians compared to non-vegetarians, Tonstad also stratified results by race/ethnicity (Blacks and non -Blacks) and vegetarian category (vegan, lacto -ovo, pesco , and semi -vegetarians). For incident type 2 diabetes, Blacks had an increased risk compared to non -Blacks. In White s, vegan, lacto -ovo vegetarian, and semi -vegetarian diets were protective against type 2 diabetes; whereas, in Blacks, only the vegan and lacto -ovo vegetarian diets showed a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, compared to a non-vegetarian diet. Impaired Gl ucose Tolerance and/or Insulin Resistance This category included studies that assessed fasting blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance, fasting blood insulin, insulin resistance using t he Homeostasis Model Assessment -Insulin Resistance (HOMA -IR) equation, or the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index ( QUICKI) (table 4-C-IV-1). These outcomes were measured by standard clinical and laboratory methods. Six articles (all RCTs) looked at the effect of adherence to a dietary pattern and intermediate outcomes related to glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance (Adamsson , did not examine insulin resistance. The results from these studies on glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance are mixed. The three RCTs examining a Mediterranean -style diet pattern reported inconsistent results on glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance. The PREDIMED trial in Spain found no effect of a Mediterranean -style diet on fasting glucose in subjects with three or more CVD risk factors (Salas -Salvado 2008). Instruction to adhere to a Mediterranean -style diet resulted in improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, compared to a Prudent diet, in subjects with me tabolic syndrome in Italy (Esposite 2004); however, this had no effect on insulin resistance among subjects with abdomi nal obesity in Greece (Rallidis , 2009). Dietary Patterns 208 The DASH diet and modified DASH diet were e xamined i n two RCTs (Blumenthal , 2010; Gadgil , 2013). In the ENCORE trial, results showed that the DASH diet alone had no effect on fasting glucose or fasting insulin and HOMA -IR among overweight or obese subjects with high blood pressure (Blumenthal , 2010). In the OmniHeart trial, results showed that a DASH diet modified to be high in unsaturated fat (primarily monounsaturated fat), when compared to a carbohydrate -rich diet (similar to DASH), had a favorable effect on HOMA -IR, but no effect on fasting blood glucose or insulin levels in overweight or o bese subjects w ith high blood pressure (Gadgil , 2013). The high carbohydrate/DASH -style diet and the high protein diet had no effect on HOMA -IR, fasti ng glucose or fasting insulin. Adamsson (2011) (RCT) found that a Nordic diet in Sweden among subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia resulted in a decrease in fasting insulin resistance and HOMA -IR, but no effect on fasting glucose. Qualitative Assessment of the Collected Evidence Quality and Quan tity Quality assessment for the studies included in this systematic review involved determining the validity of each study. Validity was assessed by examining the scientific soundness of study design and execution to avoid potential bias in the findings related to outcomes. The majority of evidence for this body of evidence consisted of positive quality studies (7 out of 8 articles). This was a limited number of studies with variation in the outcomes measured. Consistency There were too few articles related to the clinical endpoint outcome, incident type 2 diabetes, with different study designs, countries, and dietary patterns to make them comparable even though the studies found a favorable outcome associated with either a Medi terranean -style diet (PREDIMED) o r a vegetarian diet. Glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance were assessed in six large RCTs that examined three different dietary patterns (Mediterranean -style, DASH -style, a nd Nordic) with mixed findings. There were differences within the Mediterranean -style and DASH -style patterns that made comparison difficult . Impact The body of evidence directly addressed the exposures and health outcomes of interest for this systematic review, but only two studies measured the endpoint outcome, incident type 2 diabetes. When there were associations between a dietary pattern and incidence of type 2 diabetes, these were clinically meaningful. However the two studies cannot be compared since they looked at different dietary patterns. Generalizability/External Valid ity Five out of the eight studies w ere conducted outside of the United States /Canada so those dietary patterns examined may not be representative of a U.S. diet. Also , five of the studies did not report race/ethnicity and only one study stratified their results based on rac e/ethnicity (Blacks versus non -Blacks). However, the European studies were likely conducted with a predominantly Caucasian population; therefore, it may be representative of a U.S. Caucasian population. Overall, there were too few studies on either incident type 2 diabetes or glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance to draw a conclusion based on the findings. Limitations of the Evidence It is difficult to synthesize the results from the studies in this review because there were too few studies and they examined different dietary patterns or patterns that were operationalized differently. The studies included a predominantly Caucasian population with varied baseline health status. Research Recommendations Overall, there is a need for additional research RCTs and observation al studies conducted in the United States on risk of type 2 diabetes that address the key dietary patterns in a standardized way. In add ition, more analysis of key subpopulation groups would further inform policy in this area.

Dietary Patterns 1 Appendices A-E Appendix A : Methods Used to Assess Dietary Patterns Appendix B: Analytical Framework Appendix C : Research Design and Implementation Checklist for Primary Research Articles Appendix D : Key Trends Questionnaire Appendix E: Conclusion Statement Grading Criteria Dietary Patterns 2 Appendix A: Methods Used to Assess Dietary Patterns Dietary patterns can be assessed in a number of ways, including numerical indices designed to gauge adherence to a particular pattern (e.g., Healthy Eating Index [HEI]) or data -driven approaches that use mathematics to empirically derive food intake patter ns inherent among the study population (e.g., factor or cluster analysis). E ach methodology provides information about dietary patterns fr om a different perspective. A summary of the methods used to assess dietary patterns using index analysis, factor or cluster analysis, and reduced rank regression is provided below. Index Analysis Hypothesis -oriented dietary patterns are assessed by use of a priori scores that measure the degree of adherence to specific dietary guidelines/recommendations or adherence to a healthy diet defined by scientific evidence on diet and disease. A priori scores are composite numeric scores of foods, food components, and/or nutrients that are assessed as dichotomous variables (with predefined cut -points), ordinal variables such as quintiles, or as continuous variables. The individual components are summed to derive a total score so that all subjects can be ranked from maximum to minimum score (Schulze, 2006; Reedy, 2010) . Mediterranean Dietary Pattern Examples of Mediterranean diet scores that were used in the studies included in this systematic review project are described below. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) of Trichopolou et al . (2003) has nine components that include food and nutrients that are scored dichotomously (0, 1) with positive (+), positive in moderation (+m), or negative ( -) scoring. There are six (+) components: vegetables, fruit & nuts, legumes, cereals, fish, and the MUF A/SFA ratio; one (+m) component, alcohol; and two ( -) components: meat and dairy. For (+) components, persons whose consumption is below the median are assigned 0 points and those at or above the median are assigned 1 point. For ( -) components, persons whose consumption is below the median are assigned 1 point and those at o r above the median are assigned 0 points. For alcohol, a value of 1 is assigned to men who consume between 10 -50 g/d and to women who consume 5- 25 g/d, and 0 points for above and below the sex -specific ranges. For fat intake, a ratio of monounsaturated fat s to saturated fats is used. The total MDS ranges from 0 (minimal adherence) to 9 (maximal adherence). The relative Med Diet Score (rMED) described by Buckland et al . (2009) is a variation on the original nine component MDS. Each rMED component (except alcohol) is measured as g/1,000 kcal/day and is divided into tertiles of dietary intake with values of 0, 1, 2 assigned to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd tertiles of intake, respectively. There are six (+) components: fruit (including nuts and seeds, but excluding fruit juices), vegetables (excluding potatoes), legumes, cereals (including whole- grain and refined flour, pasta, rice, other grains, and bread), fresh f ish (including seafo od), and olive oil. There are two ( -) components: total meat (including processed meat) and dairy products (including low -fat and high -fat milk, yogurt, cheese, cream desserts, and dairy and non- dairy creams) positively scoring lower in takes. Alcohol, considered beneficial in moderation, is scored as a dichotomous variable: 2 points are assigned for moderate consumption, 5- 25 g/d for women and 10- 50 g/d for men, and 0 points for above and below the sex- specific ranges. The total rMED sco re ranges from 0 (minimal adherence) to 18 (maximal adherence). The Mediterranean Style Diet Pattern Score (MSDPS) of Rumawas et al . (2009) is constructed on the basis of the Mediterranean diet pyramid. The score has 13 components that correspond to the 13 food groups of the pyramid: whole -grain cereals, fruits, vegetables, dairy, wine, fish, poultry, olives -legumes - nuts, potatoes, eggs, sweets, meats, and olive oil. For each food group, the pyramid recommends the Dietary Patterns 3 numbe r of daily or weekly servings. Each group is scored from 0 -10 depending on the degree of correspondence with recommendations (e.g. , consuming 60 percent of t he recommended servings results in score of 6). There are also negative points related to over consumption; in this case subtracting a p oint proportionally to the number of servings that exceed the recommended intake (e.g. , exceeding the recommendation by 60 percent results in a score of 4). Olive oil scoring is categorical, based on exclusive use of olive oil (10 points), olive w/other ve getable oils (5 points) , or no olive oil (0 points). The total MSDPS ranges from 0 (minimal adherence) to 130 (maximal adherence). Dietary Guidelines- Related Patterns Examples of dietary guidelines -related indices that were used in the studies included in this systematic review project are described below. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) of Kennedy et al. (1995) has 10 components with 1- 10 points each. Components 1 -5 measure the degree to which a person's diet conforms to the serving recommendations of the 1990 USDA Food Guide Pyramid for 5 major food groups: grains, vegetables, fruits, milk, and meat. Component 6 is based on overall fat consumption as a percent of total energy (E) (<30%E to >45%E); component 7 is based on sat urated fat (SFA) intake (<10%E to >15%E); and component 8 is based on cholesterol intake (<300 mg to >450 mg). Component 9 is based on sodium intake (<2400 mg to >4800 mg) and component 10 is based on the amount of variety in a person's diet. The points for each component are determined by the number of servings for a given energy intake level. A person who consumes the recommended number of servings from any food group receives 10 points for th at group (e.g. , if 4 servings/d of vegetables is recommended, consumption of 4 servings receives 10 points) and a person who consumes no servings receives a 0. The points are calculated proportionately from 0 to 10. Components 6- 9 are scored inversely such that the low end of recommended intake receives 10 points. Component 10 refers to diet variety, with > 16 different foods per 3 days given 10 points, and < 6 different foods per 3 day s given 0 points. The total HEI ranges from 0 (minimal adherence) to 100 ( maximal adherence). The Alternate Health y Eating Index (AHEI) of McCullough et al. (2002) incorporates several aspects of the original HEI and some components correspond to existing dietary guidelines. There are six (+) components: vegetables, fruit, nut s and soy, cereal fiber, PUFA/SFA, and whi te/red component: trans fats. These components of the AHEI each contributed 0 - 10 points to the total score, with inverse scoring for trans fats. Intermediate intakes are scored proportionately between 0 and 10. The multivitamin component is dichotomous, contributing either 2.5 points (use <5y) or 7.5 points (use 5y). All component scores are summed to obtain a total AHEI score ranging from 2.5 (minimum) to 87.5 (maximum). The Diet Quality Index 2005 of Zamora et al. (2010) is an update of the revised DQI (DQI -R) to reflect the Dietary Guidelines for Americans , 2005 (2005 DGAs; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2005) . Each of the 10 DQI -2005 components, 0-10 points each, are scored based on the percentage of dietary recommendations met, specific cutoffs for nutrient i ntake, or distribution of values in a given sample. There are four (+) components: vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and low-fat milk; two (+m) components: sodium and alcohol; and four ( -) components: total fat, SFA, cholesterol, and sugar. The specific ser ving recommendations for different levels of energy intake are from the 2005 DGAs. Points are neither added nor subtracted for servings in excess of recommended intakes. The last component relates to the broader health message to consume a variety of foods . The diversity component reflects consumption of foods from 17 food group categories. The total DQI -2005 ranges from 0 (minimal adherence) to 100 (maximal adherence). Dietary Patterns 4 The Programme National Nutrition Sant\u00e9 Guideline Score (PNNS- GS) is a score based on adherence to nutrition guidelines for the general population in France as described by Estaquio et al. (2009). The score is based on French national guidelines and includes 13 components that refer to French food serving recommendati ons or consumption limitation. PNNS -GS can be negative owing to negative points and penalties for high energy intakes. There are 12 nutritional components: fruit and vegetables 0 -2 points, starchy foods 0- 1 point, whole grains 0- 1 point, dairy products 0- 1 point, meat 0 -1 point, seafood 0- 1 point, added fat 0 -1 point, vegetable fat 0 -1 point, sweets - 0.5 to 1 points, water and soda 0- 1 point, alcohol 0- 1 point, and salt - 0.5 to 1.5 points. The last component is adherence to physical activity recommendations, scored from 0 -1.5 points. There are penalties for energy intake >5 percent of energy need. The total PNNS - GS ranges from 0 (minimal adherence) to 15 (maximal adherence). DASH Food Group Score of Levitan et al. (2009) was designed to reflect adherence to a DASH eating pattern as described in the 2005 DGAs. There are a total of 10 components: fruits, vegetables, nuts/seeds/legumes, low -fat dairy, total grains, whole grains, sweets and added sugars, lean meats/poultry/fish, discretionary fats and oils, and alcoholic beverages. Each component receives 1 point for meeting guidelines. For total grains, dairy, lean meats, and nuts/seeds/legumes, 1 point is given for consumption at guideline level, with partial points for consuming more or less depending on the per centage of deviation. For vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, 1 point is given for consumption at guideline level, with partial points for less consumption but not for overconsumption. The total DASH Food Group Score ranges from 0 (minimal adherence) to 7 (maximal adherence). Factor or Cluster Analysis 1 Factor and cluster analyses are data- driven approaches that use mathematics to empirically derive food intake patterns. Dietary data is often assessed using food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), 24 -hour recalls, or diet records. When factor or cluster analysis is used, a larger set of dietary variables is aggregated and reduced to form a smaller set of variables. Each dietary pattern is designated by a descriptive name based on predominant food groupings (largest or smallest amount relative to the other patterns). Briefly, the methods used by the articles reviewed in this portfolio are: Factor Analysis Factor analysis is a method that reduces the number of dietary variables by finding factors that are co mposed of correlated dietary variables (Kant , 2004; Newby, 2004). Principal components analysis (PCA) is a form o f exploratory factor analysis. PCA does not assume an underlying model of the factors and uses matrix algebra to identify the principal components in the data based on a correlation or covariance matrix of the input variables. The patterns are derived based on the relationships between the input variables (i.e., the foods or food groups). The resulting components, or factors, are linear combinations of the observed variables that explain the variance in the data. The factors can be rotated to improve interpretability; orthogonal rotation is commonly used. Output from the principal components analysis includes factor loadings (or scoring coefficients) for each variable, which can be interpreted as correlation coefficients. For example, food is separated into groups based on the correlation between food items or food groups, and a person receives a factor score for each of the 1 The methodology outlined here is based upon standard statisti cal principles and procedures. Examples of the method may be found in Moeller et al. (2007) (K-means method, Ward's method); Kant (2004) analysis); Newby et (2004) (factor analysis); Ma rtinez et al. (1997 ) (subjective elements in factor and cluster analysis); Hu et al. (1999) (limitations of dietary pattern analysis, limitations of generalizability of results); and Reedy et al. (2009) (limitations of generalizability of results). Dietary Patterns 5 derived factors. A person's dietary pattern would be best represented by assessing his or her factor scores for each of the derived factors. Fact ors are not mutual ly exclusive: individuals receive factor scores for each derived factor. Factors are continuous variables that often are categorized into quartiles. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) involves specifying both the number of factors and the types of variab les that will load in each factor, allowing the researcher to use prior knowledge about the subject matter. The researcher then builds the factor model and \"confirms\" the factor structure and loadings for each variable. Cluster Analysis Cluster analysis derives patterns by aggregating individuals based on differences in their food intakes. In this method , individuals are placed into distinct non -overlapping groups on the basis of some common dietary intake (Kant, 2004; Newby, 2004). Several types of clus tering methods are available. Clustering methods used in nutritional epidemiology separate individuals into mutually exclusive, non -overlapping groups. Individuals belong to one cluster only, and clusters can then be used as categorical (nominal) variables in research. Many of the procedures are sensitive to outliers, and researchers often standardize their data before entering variables into the analysis. K-means method is an optimization technique. It requires the researcher to pre specify the number of clusters in the analysis (Moeller, 2007). Ward's method is a hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique. It does not require that the number of clusters in the analysis be pre specified (Moeller, 2007). Reduced Rank Regression Reduced rank regression (RRR) is a statistical method that is used to determine dietary patterns (combinations of food intake) that explain as much variation as possible among a set of response variables. It is an a posteriori method since it combines both existing evidence and exploratory statistics. The method uses prior knowledge gained from existing science about nutrient -disease relations to identify response variables. These response variables can either be nutrients or biomarkers that have been shown to be associated with the development of the health outcome being investigated. Dietary patterns that explain variation in the response variables are identified. Typically, subsequent analyses are done using only those patter ns that explain the most variation in the response variables. Then, for each pattern, a dietary pattern score is calculated for each study subject. Analyses are done using these scores to determine whether any of the dietary patterns are associated with th e health outcomes of interest. REFERENCES 1.

Dietary Patterns Appendix B: Analytical Framework Dietary Patterns 8 Appendix C: Research Design and Implementation Checklist for Primary Research Articles Each study included in a NEL systematic review receives a quality rating of positive, neutral, or negative, based upon a predefined scoring system. The appraisal of study quality is a critical component of the systematic review methodology because in a highly transparent manner, it indicates the relevance (external validity/generalizability) and validity of each study's results. The Research Design and Implementation Checklis t: Primary Research includes 10 validity questions based on the AHRQ domains for research studies. Sub -questions are listed under each validity question that identify important aspects of sound study design and execution relevant to each domain. Some sub -questions also identify how the domain applies in specific research designs. Validity Questions 1. Was the research question clearly stated? 1.1 Was the specific intervention(s) or procedure (independent variable(s)) identified? 1.2 Was the outcome(s) (dependent variable(s)) clearly i ndicated? 1.3 Were the target population and setting specified? 2. Was the selection of study subjects/patients free from bias? 2.1 Were inclusion/exclusion criteria specified (e.g., risk, point in disease progression, diagnostic or prognosis criteria), and with sufficient detail and without omitting criteria critical to the study? 2.2 Were criteria applied equally to all study groups? 2.3 Were health, demographics, and other characteristics of subjects described? 2.4 Were the subjects/patients a represen tative sample of the relevant population? 3. Were study groups comparable? 3.1 Was the method of assigning subjects/patients to groups described and unbiased? (Method of randomization identified if RCT .) 3.2 Were distribution of disease status, prognostic factors, and other factors (e.g., demographics) similar across study groups at baseline? 3.3 Were concurrent controls used? (Concurrent preferred over historical controls.) 3.4 If cohort study or cross -sectional study, were groups comparable on important confounding factors and/or were preexisting differences accounted for by using appropriate adjustments in statistical analysis? 3.5 If case control or cross -sectional study, were potential confounding factors comparable for cases and controls? (If case series or trial with subjects serving as own control, this criterion is not applicable. Criterion may not be applicable in so me cross- sectional studies.) 3.6 If diagnostic test, was there an independent blind comparison with an appropriate reference standard (e.g., \"gold standard\")? 4. Was method of handling withdrawals described? 4.1 Were follow -up methods described and the same for all groups? 4.2 Was the number, characteristics of withdrawals (i.e., dropouts, lost to follow up, attrition rate) , and/or r esponse rate (cross - sectional studies) de scribed for each group? (Follow -up goal for a strong study is 80 percent .) 4.3 Were all enrolled subjects/patients (in the original sample) accounted for? 4.4 Were reasons for withdrawals similar across groups? 4.5 If diagnostic test, was decision to perform reference test not dependent on results of test under study? 5. Was blinding used to prevent introduction of bias? 5.1 In intervention study, were subjects, clinicians/practitioners, and investigators blinded to treatment group, as appropriate? 5.2 Were data collectors blinded for outcomes assessment? (If outcome is measured using an objective test, such as a lab value, this criterion is assumed to be met.) 5.3 In cohort study or cross -sectional study, were measu rements of outcomes and risk factors blinded? 5.4 In case control study, was case definition explicit and case ascertainment not influenced by exposure status? 5.5 In diagnostic study, were test results blinded to patient history and other test results? Dietary Patterns 9 6. Were intervention/therapeutic regimens/exposure factor or procedure and any comparison(s) described in detail? Were intervening factors described? 6.1 In RCT or other intervention trial, were protocols described for all regimens studied? 6.2 In observat ional study, were interventions, study settings, and clinicians/provider described? 6.3 Was the intensity and duration of the intervention or exposure factor sufficient to produce a meaningful effect? 6.4 Was the amount of exposure and, if relevant, subject/patient compliance measured? 6.5 Were co -interventions (e.g., ancillary treatments, other therapies) described? 6.6 Were extra or unplanned treatments described? 6.7 Was the information for 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6 assessed the same way for all groups? 6.8 In diagnostic study, were details of test administration and replication sufficient? 7. Were outcomes clearly defined and the measurements valid and reliable? 7.1 Were primary and secondary endpoints described and relevant to the question? 7.2 Were nutrition measures appropriate to question and outcomes of concern? 7.3 Was the period of follow -up long enough for important outcome(s) to occur? 7.4 Were the observations and measurements based on standard, valid, and reliable data collection instruments/tests/pr ocedures? 7.5 Was the measurement of effect at an appropriate level of precision? 7.6 Were other factors accounted for (measured) that could affect outcomes? 7.7 Were the measurements conducted consistently across groups? 8.

Study subjects from China Dietary Patterns 1 Appendix I: Compiled Findings, Limitations, and Research Recommendations Dietary Patterns and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Index Analysis: What is the relationship between adherence to dietary g uidelines/ recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and risk of cardiovascular disease? Conclusion Statement There is strong and consistent evidence that in healthy adults increased adherence to dietary patterns scoring high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated oils, low -fat dairy, poultry , and fish; low in red and processed meat, high- fat dairy, and added sugars; and moderate in alcohol is associated with decreased risk of fatal and non -fatal cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and stroke. Grade I - Strong Key Findi ngs: Three major categories of dietary pattern scores were identified related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk: dietary exposure based on adherence to ( 1) a Mediterranean dietary pattern, (2) dietary guidelines recommendations, or ( 3) a DASH diet. The preponderance of the evidence from studies carried out in large, well -characterized prospective cohorts from the United States , Europe, Japan, and Australia showed that, in healthy adults, an increase in a Mediterranean diet score or dietary guidelines -related score was associated with decreased risk of fatal and non -fatal CVD, defined as coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as decreased risk of CHD and stroke as individual clinical outcomes. Fewer studies assessed the association between adherence to a DASH diet and CVD, CHD, or stroke outcomes, using an index or score, and their findings were inconsistent. Scores that were most frequently associated with decreased risk of CVD, CHD, or stroke, in categorical comparisons of adheren ce, were the original Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed), the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) -2005, the Alternate HEI (AHEI) and updated AHEI- 2010, the Recommended Food Score (RFS), and one of the DASH scores. Positive food components of scores that were associated with decreased CVD risk were fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated fats, and fish. Alcohol was included as a positive component when consumed in mode ration, but not in all scores. Red and processed meats were negative components in the Mediterranean scores, AHEI scores, and DASH; whereas, poultry was included as a positive component in the original AHEI and RFS scores. Total high -fat dairy was a negative component in the MDS, but dairy was a positive component when meeting recommended intakes for the HEI -2005 or as low -fat dairy in the RFS and DASH scores. Certain scores also included sugars or sugar -sweetened beverages as negative components. Dietary Patterns 2 Studies that assessed the association betw een individual food components of scores and CVD risk were consistent with the identified food components from comparisons across predictive scores. A smaller number of studies examined intermediate, secondary outcomes and other individual clinical endpoin ts outcomes with mixed results. Limitations of the Evidence Common limitations of studies on dietary patterns using a priori scores involve the use of different scores, differences between scores that are based on median population intakes versus indices that are based on recommended intakes, scores that use similar weights for each component assuming equivalent effects on health, the use of different confounding factors (or lack of sufficient adjustment), and problems associated with use of different FFQ s and validation related to other methods of diet assessment. It should be said, however, that in this relatively large body of evidence, a limited number of scores were used, oftentimes less complicated versions of these scores, and in a number of cases t he different scores were tested in the same cohorts. Overall, this makes the comparison of food components across these scores feasible. Additionally, a very common limitation in many prospective cohort studies is that dietary intake is based on a single d ietary assessment at baseline, with no follow -up assessment of dietary intake over the period of the study. However, this body of evidence had notable exceptions including Chiuve (2010 [aMed/NHS] and 2011 [ HEI, AHEI/NHS, HPFS ]), and Fung (2008 [DASH/NHS] and 2009 [aMed/NHS ]) that measured dietary intakes at regular intervals across the period of follow -up of the respective studies. Therefore, these studies did take into account the fact that diets change over time due to trends in the food supply, as well as the fact that population -level and individual -level food choices change over time. Research Recommendations The studies covered in this systematic review provide results that improve some of the problems involved in dietary patterns research. For exa mple, the need for consensus on a single score or index that is applicable across populations is less problematic in this body of evidence than for some other outcomes, as a relatively small number of uncomplicated scores have been used to successfully pre dict CVD risk in large U .S. and European populations. Further quantitative analysis/comparisons of these scores and their respective components by meta -analysis would be particularly useful. Although a large number of the studies assessed food group compon ents and their association with CVD outcomes, many did not, and more precise determination of the benefits and risks of individual components ( e.g., alcohol) would be helpful for policy recommendations. In addition, component analysis could be improved by determining interaction terms across components that would be needed to maintain a dietary patterns approach. Methodologically, research in this area could be improved by measuring dietary intake at regular intervals over the course of a prospective study , rather than just at baseline (although a few of the large cohort studies in this body of evidence did this). Determining the best approach to weighing and scoring individual food components would also improve the rigor in application of scores to assess dietary pattern adherence. Additionally, studies in this body of evidence that assessed gender differences in the relationship between adherence to a dietary pattern and CVD risk found inconsistent results. Further research is needed to clarify this. There were also very few studies that identified racial/ethnic subgroups within their cohorts and analyzed these groups separately related to CVD risk and this warrants additional research. Assessment of dietary patterns at earlier and later stages of the l ife cycle is also recommended. Lastly, behavioral issues related to timing, frequency, and size of meals need further consideration. Dietary Patterns 3 Other Methods: What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/ recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using methods other than index/score, cluster or factor, or reduced rank regression analyses, and risk of cardiovascular disease? Conclusion Statement There is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of a DASH diet results in reduced blood pressure in adults with above optimal blood pressure, up to and including stage 1 hypertension. A dietary pattern consistent with the DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, low -fat dairy, fish, whole grains, fiber, potassium, and other minerals at recommended levels and low in red and processed meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. There is limited evidence that adherence to vegetarian diets is associated with decreased death from ischemic heart disease, with the association being stronger in men than in women. Grade I-Strong - DASH and Blood Pressure; III- Limited - Vegetarian and Ischemic Heart Disease Key Findings: Two types of dietary patterns were identified using other methods of assessing dietary exposure related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk: ( 1) a DASH dietary pattern and ( 2) a vegetarian -style dietary pattern. Evidence from RCTs showed a DASH diet resulted in reduced blood pressure (BP) including systolic BP (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (BP) in adults with above optimal blood pressure, up to and including stage 1 hypertension, with further reductions with the low sodium DASH modification and the DASH high protein or DASH high unsaturated fat mo difications (OmniHeart). Addition of a behavioral intervention or weight management intervention together with the DASH diet was more effecti ve in reducing BP than DASH diet alone (PREMIER, ENCORE). Approximately two -thirds of the U .S. population has pre - hypertension or hypertension. Evidence from prospective cohort studies showed a vegetarian diet was associated with reduced ischemic heart di sease (IHD) or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in four out of six studies . In studies that showed a favorable association for the vegetarian diet, the risk reduction for men was greater than that for women. The association between vegetarian diets and BP was less clear. Studies that examined cerebrovascular disease or stroke mortality did not find differences between vegetarians and non -vegetarians. The results of either a DASH diet or vegetarian diet on blood lipids were mixed regarding effects on total-, LDL -, and HDL -cholesterol and triglycerides. The DASH diet is high in fruits, vegetables, low -fat diary, whole grains, fish, fiber, potassium, and other minerals at recommended levels and low in red and processed meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks , saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. Vegetarian diets include vegan (no meat, fish, eggs, or dairy ). lacto -ovo vegetarian (includes eggs and dairy, but no fish or meat), and pesco vegetarian (includes fish, but no meat) diets. Limitations of t he Evidence Dietary Patterns 4 In the DASH trials, including the original DASH and DASH -sodium, the feeding phases were relatively brief (4 -8 weeks) and the trial outcomes were CVD risk factors, not clinical events. In DASH trials with free -living populations, including PREMIER and ENCORE, there was the potential for selection bias, as participants may have been more motivated toward behavior modifications. The studies on vegetarian diets were all prospective cohort studies , and there was the potential for vegetarian coh orts to be relatively health conscious in other lifestyle components, in addition to diet. Additionally, in these studies, analyses relied on single baseline measurements of diet, without further dietary intake assessment over the time course of prospectiv e studies. Related to the specific systematic review question on dietary patterns, vegetarian diets including vegan, lacto - ovo vegetarian, and pesco vegetarian, were most often described by what was excluded from the diet rather than a full dietary pattern including al l foods and beverages consumed. Overall, the definition of vegetarian diets has not been standardized. Research Recommendations Vegetarian diets are often defined by what is excluded from the diet rather than what is included; therefore, researchers should make efforts to characterize the diets of self -identified vegetarians more fully in terms of their patterns of food choice. In addition, standardization of the various definitions of vegetarian diets across different population s and location s would further advance knowledge in this area. The benefits of vegetarian diets are associated, in part, with decreased consumption of animal products; given this, it would help to inform policy if investigators could determine how much of a decrease in a nimal product consumption is most beneficial related to CVD risk. Methodologically, research in this area could be further improved by measuring dietary intake at regular intervals over the course of prospective studies, rather than just at baseline. Further research needs to be done to clarify the effect of a DASH diet on blood pressure outcomes by racial/ethnic subgroups, as well as gender differences in blood lipid measures. The potential gender difference in the association between veg etarian diets an d CHD mortality ( i.e., more pronounced in men) needs to be further clarified, and this could be informed by detailed analyses of different forms of vegetarian diets includ ing vegan, lacto -ovo vegetarian, and pesco -vegetarian diets, together with a fuller a ccounting of what these die ts include as well as exclude. Women's diets tend to have higher diet quality with regard to a number of dietary dimensions other than protein sources which could explain why this particular exclu sion does not have as pronounced an effect among them. Factor or Cluster Analysis: Are prevailing patterns of diet behavior in a population, assessed using factor or cluster analysis, related to risk of cardiovascular disease? Conclusion Statement Limited evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that dietary patterns, assessed using cluster or factor analysis, characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low-fat dairy products are associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease in adults. Evidence of a relationship between dietary patterns characterized by red and processed meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, and fried foods and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease is limited and less consistent. Dietary Patterns 5 Grade III - Limited Key Findings Cluster and factor analyses are data- driven approaches that describe the dietary patterns consumed by the study population. High v ariability in the studies included in this review, including populations, case number, sample size, dietary assessment techniques, methods used to define and retain factors and clusters, confounders considered and the statistical analysis employed, made comparisons among studies challenging. Patterns derived from either factor or cluster analyses are not reproducible across studies. The consolidation of food items into food groups, the number of factors or clusters to extract, and the labeling of components are based on subjective decisions. Patterns using the same naming convention frequently contain different foods or groups of foods, makin g it difficult to draw conclusions. In general, favorable associations with CVD risk were seen in dietary patterns characterized by high consumption o f vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low -fat dairy product s. The unfavorable patterns, character ized by high intake of red and processed meat, sugar - sweetened foods and drinks, and fried foods, were more mixed in results, with no association with risk frequently found. Association of patterns with favorable and unfavorable characteristics with CHD r isk was mixed. Favorable patterns described as \"prudent;\" \"healthy;\" \"evolved Mediterranean;\" \"bread, cereals, vegetables, oils;\" and \"whole grains and fruit\" had an inverse association with CHD, while other patterns described as \"prudent\" or \"healthy\" had no association with CHD. The same inconsistency was found among unfavorable patterns described as \"western\" or \"animal.\" Variation in the number, design, size of studies, and patterns identified made it difficult to identify trends related to myocardial infarction, stroke, measures of blood lipids, and blood pressure. Limitations of the Evidence Most longitudinal stud ies included only baseline measure of dietary intake and did not account for changes to subjects' diets, availability and variations in the food supply, which may have influenced the food components of patterns. Variations in the number and type of food g roupings and definitions and naming conventions found in the review are not easily comparable, and factors with the same naming convention (e.g., \"vegetable\" or \"healthy\" ) may include somewhat different foods or groups of foods with varying factor loadings. Differences in the statistical analysis approaches used to derive and retain factors and clusters influences power and the ability to detect an association. Patterns derived from factor analysis and cluster analy ses were analyzed differently. In factor analysis, \"high\" scores were generally compared with \"low\" scor es of the same pattern, though it was not clear what characteristic differences there were in a \"hi gh\" ver sus \"low\" score factor. In cluster analysis, one cluster was compared with another one, making it difficult to interpret results together. Dietary Patterns 6 Research Recommendations Evaluate and standardize methods used to assess, organize, aggregate, and adjust food variables to facilitate interpretation of findings across studies. Additional research is needed to examine if and how gender, age, SES , and ethnicity might influence the relationship between dietary patterns and cardiovascular disease risk. Explore the ch aracteristics of dietary patterns beyond food choice, such as timing and frequency of meals, meal sizes, and eating occasions. Reduced Rank Regression: What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using reduced rank regression analysis, and cardiovascular disease? Conclusion Statement Insufficient evidence, due to a small number of studies, was available to examine the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced r ank regression and risk of cardiovascular disease. The disparate nature of the methods used made it difficult to compare results, and therefore, no conclusions were drawn. Grade IV - Not Assignable Key Findings: Four positive quality prospective cohort studies that used reduced rank regression to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and cardiovascular disease (CVD) status were included in this review. Comparison across studies is limited by the small number of studies, differences in methodo logies used, and in the populations studied. Therefore , no conclusions were drawn. More U .S. population -based research is needed to examine dietary patterns and risk of cardiovascular disease using reduced rank regression, preferably with more consistent methods and response variables. Limitations of the Evidence Methodological Differences: Three out of the four studies used biomarkers and the fourth study used nutrients as response variables in the reduced rank regression analyses. Among the three studi es that used biomarkers as response variables, there were differences in the type of biomarkers chosen, leading to the identification of dietary patterns that differed from study to study. Heroux (2009) used change in BMI, mean arterial pressure, total cho lesterol, HDL -cholesterol, triglycerides (mg/dl), fasting glucose, and uric acid; Meyer (2011) used C -reactive protein, Interleukin (IL)- 6, and Interleukin (IL) -18; and McNaughton (2009) used total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. The fourt h study, Drogan (2007), used nutrients, including total fat, total carbohydrate, and fiber, as response variables. Because the dietary patterns described in each study are directly linked to response variables chosen, the variation in the response variable s used means that the resulting dietary patterns may not be comparable. Dietary Patterns 7 Dietary assessment methods were different across the studies. One study used 3 -day diet records (Heroux 2009); another used a self -administered FFQ used a 127-item validated FFQ (McNaughton 2009); and the fourth study used a 7- day dietary record (Meyer 2011). It is unclear what impacts different dietary assessment methods have on the derivation of dietary patterns using reduced rank regression. The studies were not consistent in their use of confounders in analyses. In particular, physical activity was not included as a confounder in the analyses by Meyer (2011), and Drogan (2007) did not include smoking as a confounder. Population Differences: The studies were conducted in different countries ( United States and several countries in Europe) and represented populations in different regions of the world, which limited the ability to compare and interpret the results due to potential differences in dietary patterns between these regions. From that perspective, the results may not be generalizable to some U.S. populations. Research Recommendations More research using reduced rank regression should be conducted. Additionally, standardization in methodology , such as food groupi ngs and response variables used, are also needed. Dietary Patterns and Body Weight or Risk of Obesity Index Analysis: What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/ recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and measures of body weight or obesity? Conclusion Statement There is moderate evide nce that, in adults, increased adherence to dietary patterns scoring high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, unsaturated oils, and fish; low in total meat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, and sodium; and moderate in dairy products and alcohol is associated with more favorable outcomes related to body weight or risk of obesity, with some reports of variation based on gender, race, or body weight status. Grade II - Moderate Dietary Patterns 8 Key Findings: Two major categories of dietary pattern scores were identified in the literature: ( 1) studies that examined exposure based on a Mediterranean dietary pattern and ( 2) studies that examined exposure based on dietary guidelines recommendations. In adults, adherence to a Mediterranean diet score or a dietary guidelines -related score is assoc iated with decreased risk of obesity, with some reported variation based on gender or body weight status. This protective association in adults is further supported by consistent evidence indicating that an increased Mediterranean diet score or dietary gui delines -related score is associated with decreased body weight, BMI, waist circumference or percent body fat, with some variation based on gender and race. Limitations of the Evidence Limitations of the studies included in this systematic review , and potential reasons for differences and inconsistencies in results, include the use of different scores; differences between scores that are based on median population intakes versus indices that are based on recommended intakes; the use o f different co nfounding factors or lack of sufficient adjustment for confounding factors; the problems associated with the use of different FFQs and validation related to other methods of diet assessment; and the handling of underreporting. Furthermore, in the majority of studies, total scores or indices were used and there was no separate analysis of individual score components and their potential association with outcomes. The application of the total score to the diet pattern analysis has the potential to \"dilute\" the effect of individual components. However, the assessment of individual components without interaction terms assumes that a given component has an independent association which potentially contradicts the theoretical rationale for examining the overall die tary pattern. Lastly, another common limitation was the single measurement of dietary intake at baseline. This does not take into account that diets change over time due to trends in the food supply and population- level and individual -level changes in food choices. Research Recommendations Given the combined evidence from this systematic review, several research recommendations can be advanced. Most striking is the need for consensus on a single index or score that is applicable across populations for a diversity of outcomes. If it is not feasible that one index can adequately assess the diversity of populations related to dietary patterns, research should be conducted to determine the best method by which components are chosen, grouped, and scored and wh ether or not the research tool is population based or independent of the population, so that there is uniformity across scores. The studies included in this review were focused on total scores, rather than component scores and their association with health outcomes. To strengthen the analysis of component scores, the interaction terms across components need to be assessed in order to maintain a dietary patterns approach. For prospective cohort studies, diet intake should be measured at multiple time points with assessment of dietary changes over the time as they relate to health outcomes. Dietary Patterns 9 Other Methods: What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/ recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using methods other than index/score, cluster or factor, or reduced rank regression analyses, and body weight status? Conclusion Statement There is moderate evidence that adherence to a dietary pattern that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and whole grains is associated with modest benefits in preventing weight gain or promoting weight loss in adults. Grade II - Moderate Key Findings The Women's Health Initiative (WHI), Mediterranean, Vegetarian, and \"Healthy\" dietary patterns were associated with beneficial body weight outcomes. These dietary patterns consistently emphasized fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Fewer studies considered, but consistently observed benefits, with reduced meat intake. Some studies also considered total fat intake; these studies did not support that targeting a low total fat intake is required for weight loss or stability. Studies included in this review were short to moderate in duration, and individuals with greater adherence to the plant -based dietary pattern experienced better body weight outcomes. Additional research is needed to quantify the amounts of food groups that are beneficial to consume, but, in general, movement to a dietary pattern with more plant foods and less meat is favorable related to body weight status. Limitations Five of the seven studies included in this review assessed dietary intake using FFQs. Additionally, one study assessed dietary patterns by using a simple series of questions. These dietary assessment methodologies have measurement error and also prevent suffi cient quantification of dietary intake. The studies did not consistently consider or report calorie intake and/or energy expenditure, which are important to consider when examining body weight status. Research Recommendations Additional research is needed to specify dietary patterns, particularly the quantity of different food and beverages that should be consumed. Studies, particularly randomized controlled trials, are needed that include several dietary patterns so that dietary patterns can be com pared within, in addition to between, studies to determine the optimal dietary pattern, or the consistent components across dietary patterns, that are most beneficial related to body weight status. Dietary Patterns 10 Factor or Cluster Analysis: Are prevailing patterns of diet behavior in a population, assessed using factor or cluster analysis, related to body weight or risk of obesity? Conclusion Statement Limited and inconsistent evidence from epidemiological studies examining dietary patterns derived using factor or cluster analysis in adults found that consumption of a dietary pattern characterized by vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and reduced -fat dairy products tends to be associated with more favorable body weight status over time than co nsumption of a dietary pattern characterized by red meat, processed meats, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, and refined grains. Grade III - Limited Key Findings: Cluster and factor analyses are data- driven approaches that describe the dietary patterns consumed by the study population. Variability in the studies included in this review, including populations considered, dietary assessment methods used, the number and type of food groupings included in the analyses, and the statistical techniques employed , made comparisons among studies challenging. The number of patterns identified in the studies ranged from 2 to 6 and some similarities emerged among them. The patterns were not consistently defined by specific foods, but rather by a range of foods with overlap among the patterns. What differentiated the patterns was the amount or frequency of each food consumed. Dietary patterns that emerged in factor or cluster analysis that were associated with lower risk of obesity were characterized by the presence of vegetables, fruit, whole grains , and reduced -fat dairy. In adults, results pointed toward a more favorable weight status, lower weight/waist circumference (WC) gain, and lower body mass index (BMI) over time . Dietary patterns derived from factor or cluster analysis associated with a higher risk of o besity were characterized by the presence of red meat and processed meats, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, and refined grains. Results related to consumption of these patterns pointed toward increased body weight and waist circumference measures over time. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status were often not reported or included in analyses . Insufficient evidence was available to support conclusions related to children and adolescents. Limitations Factor and cluster analyses are data- driven approaches t hat describe the dietary patterns in a particular population. The studies describe preexisting dietary patterns within the population and the dietary patterns are not based on a hypothesized association to health. The patterns derived through analyses may not represent the most beneficial or detrimental patterns relative to the health outcome of interest. Among the studies reviewed, the dietary pattern analyses varied with regard to the dietary assessment methods, the number and type of food groupings, and the statistical analysis techniques, which make comparisons challenging. In factor and cluster analysis, the consolidation of food items into food groups, the number of factors or clusters to extract, and even the labeling of components are subjective. Furthermore, patterns derived from either factor or cluster analysis may not be reproducible across studies because elements of dietary patterns and analytic decisions differ. Dietary Patterns 11 Dietary pattern analysis using factor or cluster methods may not be very inform ative in determining which elements of the diet or which biological relationships between these elements are responsible for the health outcome. Some studies completed over long periods of time did not account for changes to subjects' diets or seasonal var iations in food supplies, which may have influenced the food components of patterns. One study analyzed the dietary patterns of pre- pubescent children transitioning into adolescence. In general, the results show that patterns vary widely at this age and caution should be observed when analyzing these data because the diet of children changes rapidly, as well as their weight. Research Recommendations Insufficient evidence was available in population subgroups to examine the relationship between dietary patterns derived using factor and cluster analyses and body weight status. Future studies using this methodology should examine variables such as ethnicity, SES, sex, baseline weight status, and age. In addit ion, it is important to incorporate environmenta l and behavioral factors, such as physical activity, non -leisure physical activity, eating practices (eating out, cooking at home), indulgence over the weekend, among others, as potential confounders These variables may be moderators that in the long term will define the association between a particular pattern and weight status. There is a need for more research into specific ethnic groups and how cultural practices may influence dietary p atterns and their repercussions for body weight. Research is needed to further examine if various dietary patterns influence body weight status differently among participants who are normal weight, overweight , or obese. There is some indication that obese versus normal weight individuals respond differently to changes of f ood patterns on body weigh t measures. Research in this area may help uncover better approaches to body weight management practices. There is a need to examine the most common unhealthy/western pattern components, variations, and amounts of food consumed by those who have such a d iet. Rationale: If a pre - existing pattern is found to be detrimental to health, there is an impetus for dietary pattern modification. Reduced Rank Regression: What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/reco mmendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using reduced rank regression analysis , and measures of body weight or obesity? Conclusion Statement There were a number of methodological differences among the studies examining the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and body weight status. The disparate nature of these studies made it difficult to compare results, and therefore, no conclusions were drawn. Grade Not Assignable (IV) Dietary Patterns 12 Key Findings: Six positive quality prospective cohort studies that used reduced rank regression to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and body weight status were included in this review. However, differences in methodologies used and populations studied prevented comparison across studies, and conclusions could not be drawn. Further research is needed to examine dietary patterns and body weight status using reduced rank regression, preferably with standardized methods and response variables. Limitations of the Evidence Methodological Differences Each study used different response variables in the reduced rank regression analyses. Two studies used biomar kers as response variables. Noh (2011) used change in BMI, percent body fat, bone mineral content , and bone mineral de nsity as response variables, and Wosje (2010 ) included fat and b one mass as response variables. Four studies used nutrients a s response variables: Ambrosini (2012) and Johnson (2008) used dietary energy density, fiber density, and percent of energy as fat; Schulze (2005) used total fat, carbohydrate, and fiber; and Sherafat -Kazemzadeh (2010) used fat, PUFA: SFA, calcium, cholesterol, and fiber. In reduced rank regression, the dietary patterns identified are those that explain the most variation in the respon se variables chosen. Therefore, because the studies included in this review used different response variables, the dietary patterns derived may not be comparable. Different weight -related outcomes were examined across the studies. The most common outcomes considered were body mass i ndex (Ambrosini, 2012; Johnson, 2008; Noh, 2011; 2012; Johnson, 2008; Noh, 2011; Wosje, 2010). Two studies examined incidence of overweight or obesity and excess adiposity (Ambrosini, 2012; Johnson, 2008). Only one study examined waist circumference (Serafat -Kazemzadeh, 2010 ). This variability made it difficult to identify themes within this body of evidence. Dietary assessment methods were different across the stud ies. Of the six studies, thr ee used diet records (Ambrosini, 2012; Johnson, 2008; Wosje, 2010), one used 24- hour recalls (Sherafat -Kazemzadeh, 2010), another used a 24- hour recall and a diet record (Noh, 201 1), and one used an FFQ (Schulz, 2005). It is unc lear what impacts different dietary assessment methods have on the derivation of dietary patterns using reduced rank regression. The studies were not consistent in their use of confounders in analyses. In particular, physical activity was not included as a confounder in the analyses by Johnson ( 2008) or Noh (2011) . Population Differences Each study was conducted in a different country ( United States , Korea, United Kingdom, Iran, and Germany) and represented populations in different regions of the world, which prevented the ability to compare and interpret the results. The studies were conducted with different age groups , four with children (Ambrosini, 2012; Johnson, 2008; (Schulz, 2005; Sherafat - Kazemzadeh, 2010). Even among the studies with children, the age groups were significantly different. Research Recommendations More research using reduced rank regression should be conducted. Additionally, standardization in methodology, particularly in response variables used, is needed. Dietary Patterns 13 Dietary Patterns and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Index Analysis: What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/ recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed using an index or score, and risk of type 2 diabetes? Conclusion Statement There is limited evidence that adherence to a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals/whole grains, nut s, fish, and unsaturated oils, and low in meat and red meat and high -fat dairy, assessed using an index or score, is associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. Grade III - Limited Key Findings: Among included studies there was variation in the types of indices or scores used, without a preponderance of studies with any one index related to either risk of type 2 diabetes or fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance, making it difficult to draw overarching conclusions related to a specific dietary pattern. The different scores showed varied predictability of incident type 2 diabetes: o In European populations, adherence to the MDS was associated with reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, among women in a U .S. cohort, the AHEI had s imilar relationships. o For other scores considered, such as the Total Diet Score, German Food Pyramid Index, DQI-2005, as well as the MDS in a U .S. population, there was no relationship between diet quality and incidence of type 2 diabetes. o One study asses sing the DASH score in a U .S. population showed an association in Whites but not in Blacks. A second study showed no association between DQI -2005 and T2D incidence in Black or White young adults. The different scores showed varied association with glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance: o For impaired fasting glucose or insulin resistance , there was some agreement with the MDS and MSDPS being protective for the measures examined. o There were mixed findings for Total Diet Score, DQI -2005, and an authors' a priori score. For the mixed results, the findings differed by sex, type of intermediate outcome examined, and race/ethnicity. Limitations of the Evidence For several of the studied indices, there was only one analysis, including for the Total Diet Score, German Food Pyramid Index, DQI -2005, AHEI, and DASH. Mediterranean -style scores were the only dietary pattern measures/indices used in more than one study. It was a challenge to compare results across the studies because some of the scores were not validated and used different diet assessment tools. Furthermore, the number of study participants and number of type 2 diabetes cases varied widely. Additionally, sample size was cited by authors who examined racial/ethnic subgroups as a potential limitation in their ability to detect significant associations related to incident T2D in the MESA, CARDIA, and IRAS cohorts. Dietary Patterns 14 Research Recommendations Overall, there is a need for more coordinated studies involving multiple U .S. cohorts, all of which examine the same scores or indices assessed in a standardized way. In addition, more analysi s of key sub population groups, with sufficient sample sizes, would further inform policy in this area. Factor or Cluster Analysis: Are prevailing patterns of diet behavior in a population, assessed using factor or cluster analysis, related to risk of type 2 diabetes? Conclusion Statement Limited and inconsistent evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that in adults, dietary patterns derived using factor or cluster analysis, characterized by vegetables, fruits, and low -fat dairy products tend to have an association with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and those patterns characterized by red meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, French fries, refined grains, and high-fat dairy products tended to show an increased association for risk of type 2 diabetes. Among studies, there was substant ial variation in food group components and not all studies with similar patterns showed significant association. Grade III- Limited Key Findings Cluster and factor analyses are data- driven approaches that describe the dietary patterns consumed by the study population. High variability in the studies included in this review, including populations, case number, sample size, dietary assessment techniques, methods used to define and retain factors and clusters, confounders considered and the statistical analysis employed, made comparisons among studies challenging. Studies focused on intermediate outcomes were too few and too diverse in methodology to draw a conclusion. Limitations of the Evidence Variation in methodology used to derive and analyze dietary patterns (e.g., factor versus cluster analysis, subjective decisions regarding groupings of foods, number of patterns retained and naming conventions, population characteristics, sample size, and case numbers) make the analysis challenging. Even fa ctors with the same naming convention (e.g., \"vegetable\" or \"prudent\") included somewhat different foods or groups of foods. Patterns derived from either factor or cluster analysis may not be reproducible because of variations in populations, sample sizes , dietary assessment methods, and decisions made to define food variables used in factor and cluster analysis, and factors and clusters differ across studies. Differences in the statistical analysis approaches used to derive and retain factors and cluster s influences power and the ability to detect an association. Patterns derived from factor analysis and cluster analyses were analyzed differently. In factor analysis, \"high\" scores were generally compared with \"low\" scores of the same pattern, though it wa s not clear what characteristic differences there were in a \"high\" versus \"low\" score factor. In cluster analysis, one cluster was compared with another one, making it difficult to interpret results together. Dietary Patterns 15 Dietary patterns with significant association should not be construed as the best or worst possible diet associated with diabetes risk. Most longitudinal studies included only baseline measure of dietary intake and did not account for changes in subject's diets, availability, and variations in the foo d supply, which may have influenced the food components of patterns. Food frequency questionnaires may not accurately capture important elements of the diet. Research Recommendations Evaluate and standardize methods used to assess, organize, aggregate, and adjust food variables to facilitate interpretation of findings across studies. Additional research is needed to examine if and how gender, age, SES , and ethnicity might influence the relationship between dietary patterns and risk for T2D. Consider important confounders that may modify or explain the association between dietary intake and T2D, for example weight change. Other Methods: What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/ recommendations or specific dietary patterns, asse ssed using methods other than index/score, cluster or factor, or reduced rank regression analyses, and risk of type 2 diabetes? Conclusion Statement There is insufficient evidence on a relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean -style or vegetarian diet pattern and incidence of type 2 diabetes. There is limited, inconsistent evidence that adherence to a Mediterranean -style, DASH or modified DASH, or Nordic dietary pattern results in improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Grade IV-Not Assignable - Incidence of type 2 diabetes; III -Limited -Glucose tolerance and insulin resistance Key Findings: Four types of dietary patterns were identified using other methods of assessing dietary exposure re lated to type 2 diabetes risk: ( 1) a Mediterranean -style pattern, ( 2) a DASH or modified DASH pattern, ( 3) a vegetarian pattern, and ( 4) a Nordic pattern. Overall, there were too few articles and the dietary patterns and study characteristics were too varied to compare across studies. A favo rable association was found in a Mediterranean -style diet combined with olive oil and/or nuts, and in a vegetarian diet compared to a non -vegetarian diet with incidence of type 2 diabetes higher in Black versus non -Blacks. Five out of eight studies were co nducted outside of the United States with only thre e out of eight articles reporting race/ethnicity and, of those, only one study reported results based on race/ethnicity. Limitations of the studies include: o All of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included different at- risk populations. Dietary Patterns 16 o Too few articles examined a relationship between dietary patterns and the endpoint outcome of incident type 2 diabetes to draw a conclusion, although the two patterns studied (one Mediterranean -style and one vegeta rian) showed a favorable effect. o Too few articles assessed the intermediate outcomes of impaired glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance. The results related to impaired glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance were too mixed to identify a consistent pattern. o It is difficult to assess food components, as there were too few studies across several different patterns that were operationalized differently. Limitations of the Evidence It is difficult to synthesize the results from the studies in this review because there were too few studies and they examined different dietary patterns or patterns that were operationalized differently. The studies included a predominantly Caucasian popu lation with varied baseline health status. Research Recommendations Overall, there is a need for additional research RCTs and observation al studies conducted in the United States on risk of type 2 diabetes that address the key dietary patterns in a standardized way. In add ition, more analysis of key sub population groups would further inform policy in this area. Reduced Rank Regression: What is the relationship between adherence to dietary guidelines/recommendations or specific dietary patterns, assessed u sing reduced rank regression analysis, and risk of type 2 diabetes? Conclusion Statement There is insufficient evidence, due to a small number of studies, to examine the relationship between dietary patterns derived using reduced rank regression and risk of type 2 diabetes. The differences in the methods used and populations studied made it difficult to compare results, and therefore no conclusions were drawn. Grade IV - Not Assignable Key Findings: The three positive quality prospective cohort studies included in this review used reduced rank regression ( see appendix A ) analysis to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Comparison across studies was limited by the small number of studies, differences in methodology, and in the populations studied. Therefore , no conclusions were drawn. Limitations of the Evidence Methodological Differences: All of the studies used different types of biomarkers as response variables, such as PAI -1 and fibrinogen; HOMA -IR index; and BMI, fasting glucose, TG, HDL, and hypertension, making it difficult to make comparisons across these studies. Dietary Patterns 17 The dietary patterns described in each of these studies were directly linked to the response variables selected; therefore, the variat ion in the response variables used suggest that the resulting dietary patterns may not be comparable. There were variations in dietary assessment methods used to assess dietary intake, as well as the food groupings used in the analyses across the studies. For example, Liese (2009) used a 114-item validated semi -quantitative FFQ, created 33 food groups on the basis of similarities in food and nutrient composition, and queried alcoholic beverages separately. McNaughton (2008) used a 127- item validated FFQ and the food and beverage items were aggregated into 71 groups on the basis of nutrient content, cooking, and preparation methods. Imamura ( 2009) used a 126- item validated semi- quantitative FFQ (FOS) and used food groupings from previous studies to each RRR -derived dietary pattern and applied to the FOS data to create three different sets of food groups used in their analyses. These methodological differences make it difficult to compare the resulting dietary patterns across studies and to determine how these differences may have contributed to differences in relationships between the patterns and type 2 diabetes risks. The studies were not consistent in their use of confounders in the analyses. For example, as compared to McNaughton (2008), alcohol intake was not included as a confounder in the analyses by Liese (2009), and alcohol, BMI, and smoking status were not included as confounders by Imamura (2009). Population Differences: Two of the studies were conducted in the United States and one in the United Kin gdom and represented populations in different regions of the world, which limited the ability to compare and interpret the results due to potential differences in dietary patterns between these regions. Research Recommendations More research using reduced rank regression analyses should be conducted to investigate the relationship between dietary patterns and type 2 diabetes, particularly among U .S.-based populations, and including both intermediate outcomes (glucose intolerance, insulin resistance), as well as incidence of disease. Additionally, standardization in methodology, such as response variables and food groupings used, are also needed.

Other Methods Cardiovascular Disease There is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of a DASH diet results in reduced blood pressure in adults with above optimal blood pressure, up to and including stage 1 hypertension. A dietary pattern consistent with the DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, low -fat dairy, fish, whole gr ains, fiber, potassium , and other minerals at recommended levels, and low in red and processed meat, sugar -sweetened foods and drinks, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.
