Energy drinks give you an extra dose of energy and increase your physical and mental performance. As appealing as it may sound, regular usage of energy drinks may have certain undesirable side effects over time. It's essential to seek out choices that accomplish the goal while causing no harm to your health or physique. Organic energy drinks are made with all-natural, organic components, making them a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks. They are particularly effective in providing a burst of energy while remaining sugar-free and low in calories. Continue reading to answer all your organic energy drink-related questions along with a list of my favorite organic energy drink brands. Are Organic Energy Drinks Good For You? Organic energy drinks are indeed good for you. In comparison to other energy drinks on the market, organic energy drinks feature components that are healthier and more ethically sourced. Caffeine and sugar are the elements in energy drinks that make them unhealthy. The high levels of sugar and caffeine are frequently close to or above the prescribed limits. The [AHA](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/added-sugar-in-the-diet/#:~:text=The%20AHA%20suggests%20an%20added,comes%20from%20eating%20added%20sugar.) recommends that males consume up to 36 g of sugar and women consume up to 25 g. Caffeine intake should not exceed 400mg per day, according to the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much#:~:text=For%20healthy%20adults%2C%20the%20FDA,it%20(break%20it%20down).). Due to the high caffeine concentration in energy drinks, consuming more than one serving can rapidly surpass the daily limit. They can cause a variety of adverse effects, including insomnia, anxiety, and high blood pressure. Organic energy drinks, on the other hand, have a healthier mix of ingredients that are free of artificial colors, sugars, and preservatives. The sugar is produced from organic sugarcane juice, while the caffeine is plant-based and naturally sourced. Organic energy drinks are also frequently low in calories, ensuring that you do not exceed your daily calorie allowance. Are Organic Energy Drinks Bad For You? Many energy drinks that claim to be healthy may pose certain health risks. Depending on the ingredients and nature of the drink, all caffeinated beverages may have some potential side effects. There is no industry standard for 'healthy' in energy drinks. Organic energy drinks use better alternatives to the same ingredients that make up most energy drinks. They use organic cane syrup or honey instead of high glucose or [fructose](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-is-fructose-bad-for-you) to achieve the sweet taste of energy drinks. Moreover, when organic brands use added sugar or fruit extracts to compensate for traditional stevia, long-term use of these added sugars may have adverse effects on health. Not to say that using organic energy drinks isn't a forward step in the right direction compared to a lot of high caffeine high sugar energy drinks, there hasn't been much advancement in providing a clean energy boost even with organic energy drink brands. What To Look For In Organic Energy Drinks So, what is it you're looking out for in an organic energy drink? Here are the 3 most essential things to keep in mind when trying to find an energy drink that best suits your diet. Natural Caffeine Content For starters, you're going to want something with natural caffeine present, which means caffeine sourced from organic materials, mostly plants. Generally, I would recommend sticking to energy drinks that explicitly state that their caffeine comes from tea leaves, coffee beans, or other plant-based caffeine sources, as most other times the caffeine in energy drinks might be synthetic which, while achieving the same thing, may not fit the bill of being an organic ingredient. As usual, I would suggest that you restrict yourself to energy drinks that have just a low to medium quantity of caffeine. This will ensure that you do not come dangerously near to exceeding the FDA's daily limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine after consuming only one can. Medium to Low Sugar Content Sugar, surprisingly enough, is the most organic sweetener you can find, although it's certainly not healthy in large quantities. If you want to avoid the bane of artificial sweeteners, you're probably going to have to contend with your energy drink having some amount of sugar present, albeit in fairly low amounts if you know which brands to look for. Generally, the [AHA](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/how-much-sugar-is-too-much#:~:text=AHA%20Sugar%20Recommendation&text=Men%20should%20consume%20no%20more,or%20100%20calories)%20per%20day.) recommends no more than 25g or 36 of added sugar daily for women and men respectively. So as long as you're energy drink doesn't exceed the limit in one serving, it should be fairly viable for your organic purposes, plus being pretty easy to burn off with some light exercise. No Artificial Sweeteners/Ingredients Given that energy drinks aren't known for being 'organic', it's in your best interest to filter out the more well-known brands which often have some artificial ingredients in them, not to mention most sugar-free energy drinks, which always have some form of artificial sweetener present. Going organic sadly does not mean going sugar-free, as sugar-free energy drinks often contain sucralose or acesulfame potassium, both of which are zero-calorie sweeteners that won't affect your nutritional intake, but are nonetheless, artificial. As such, do have a keen eye trained on the ingredients list of any energy drink that might be on your radar, as they often do give an accurate description of what goes into an energy drink. What Is The Best Natural Energy Booster? It's nice to get a boost in energy and performance, and we all need it now and then. However, we don't have to rely just on energy drinks to do this. Maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle will produce the same results over time without posing any health hazards. Here's a list of some behaviors and routines that will naturally give you more energy: Water The importance of water in maintaining your body's performance cannot be overstated. Drinking enough water and keeping the body hydrated can help to alleviate fatigue symptoms and improve the activities of several organs. Dehydration can make you feel lethargic and fatigued. Make sure you don't get thirsty during the day. For optimal performance, consume at least six to eight glasses each day. One of the many advantages of drinking water is that it keeps the body hydrated and ready to fulfill its functions. Yerba Mate [Yerba Mate](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-benefits-of-yerba-mate) is a drink made from the leaves of plants found in South America. Antioxidants and natural caffeine abound in yerba mate. It has the same amount of caffeine as a small cup of coffee. Yerba Mate gives you the boost in energy from its caffeine without the jitters or the [increase](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/energy-boosting-foods#10.-Yerba-mat) in blood pressure. It is also used in many organic energy drinks for a healthier spin to your go-to caffeine fix and is also known to increase your mental focus and mood. Exercise Exercising is a great way to increase your energy levels naturally. Sometimes a daily 10-minute workout can boost your energy and happiness while also maintaining optimal performance. Oxygen-rich blood travels through your heart, brain, and muscles while you exercise. Exercise not only benefits your body and fitness, but it also boosts your energy and improves your attitude toward your everyday activities. To gain that burst of energy and confidence, you don't need a tough training schedule. Those little movements have an impact as well.
