What to buy for a flu pandemic With the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.thehealthy.com/infectious-disease/places-doctors-avoid-coronavirus-pandemic/) still ongoing, it's hard to even contemplate the possibility of another type of pandemic. In fact, many experts would have predicted an influenza virus as the more likely cause of a pandemic\u2014the world-wide outbreak of a new illness\u2014than a new coronavirus, which is what causes Covid-19. Typically, [flu A and B](https://www.thehealthy.com/cold-flu/flu-a-vs-flu-b/) are the two main types that can infect humans (type C only causes mild illness and type D mostly affects animals). For a flu pandemic to occur, there needs to be a global outbreak of a new influenza A virus in people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This new flu A virus would be different than the seasonal influenza A viruses that are currently circulating or circulated before in a previous flu season. Flu pandemics are rare (only four flu pandemics have occurred in the last 100 years), but it's not unlikely that one will happen again. \"It's important to plan ahead of time,\" says Nici Singletary, MD, co-chair of the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council. \"You need to have the supplies you need when the time comes and avoid a rush.\" (Here's how to [avoid getting sick](https://www.thehealthy.com/cold-flu/cold-flu-avoid-getting-sick/) in cold and flu season.) We've learned a lot from the Covid-19 experience. Here's more guidance on what you should have on hand in the event of another pandemic. (Beware of these [flu signs](https://www.thehealthy.com/cold-flu/deadly-flu-signs/).) via amazon.com KONQUEST KDT-1201 Best Digital Medical Thermometer $17 Fever is one of the most common [flu symptoms](https://www.thehealthy.com/cold-flu/flu-symptoms/). A thermometer, like the [Konquest KDT-1201](https://www.amazon.com/Konquest-KDT-1201-Thermometer-Accurate-Reading/dp/B077CRN38Z?tag=healthtmb-20), can confirm if you actually have a fever, or just feel like you do. It'll also tell you if the fever's high enough (over 103 degrees Fahrenheit) to call a doctor, says Natasha Bhuyan, MD, a family practice physician with One Medical in Phoenix. Don't spend money on no-touch infrared thermometers, advises Dr. Singletary. \"The more accurate thermometers are the oral thermometers that you put under your tongue,\" she says. They're available with digital readouts. If you have kids, it's a good idea to have rectal thermometers on hand as well. And if your thermometer runs on batteries, check them periodically to make sure they're still good. (For more suggestions, check out the best [at-home thermometers](https://www.thehealthy.com/infectious-disease/thermometers-fever-coronavirus/) to monitor coronavirus.) via amazon.com SereneLife Nitrile Disposal Gloves $20, 100-pack Disposable gloves are essential if someone in your home is sick. \"You need them to protect yourself doing the laundry, cleaning up the bathroom,\" says Dr. Singletary. She adds, \"If you're using harsh disinfectants, you need to have gloves on.\" Nitrile gloves, like this one from the [SereneLife](https://www.amazon.com/100-Nitrile-Disposable-Gloves-SLGLVNIT100LG/dp/B08JZ4MMRZ?tag=healthtmb-20), are better than latex gloves as you can become allergic to latex with long-term use. (Here's how [ stop coronavirus from spreading at home](https://www.thehealthy.com/infectious-disease/stop-coronavirus-spreading-home/).) ChiSip KN95 Face Mask $39, 20-pack [Face masks](https://www.thehealthy.com/infectious-disease/worst-face-mask-mistakes/) will protect you and others not just from Covid-19, but also from the flu. In fact, the CDC reports that the Southern Hemisphere is having a mild flu season, probably because people are already wearing masks and social distancing to prevent Covid-19. \"Masks are effective in reducing the spread of viral respiratory infections,\" says Dr. Bhuyan. The most effective masks are the N-95 masks worn by healthcare professionals, but they're generally not necessary outside a healthcare setting (and should be reserved for people who need them for that purpose). There is a close cousin for regular people: KN95 masks, like this one [ChiSip](https://www.amazon.com/KN95-Included-Breathable-Protection-Against/dp/B08KWFWXKJ?tag=healthtmb-20). KN95 masks are imported from China and don't meet the same regulatory standards as N95 masks. \"It's not considered medical grade, but it does fit better than the ones that have a gap on the side where the ear loop is,\" says Dr. Singletary. They're especially good for women and people who have smaller faces, she adds. Masks with two or more layers\u2014either cloth or woven material like polyester, or paper\u2014are also acceptable. (These are the [best face masks with filters](https://www.thehealthy.com/infectious-disease/best-face-masks-with-filters/).) via amazon.com Amazon Basic Care Rapid Release Pain Relief, Acetaminophen Caplets $15, 400-count Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a and is available over-the-counter. [Amazon Basic Care](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Care-Release-Acetaminophen-Caplets/dp/B074F2467Z?tag=healthtmb-20) carries their own 400-count can reduce the body aches and malaise which sometimes accompany the flu, says Dr. Bhuyan. Dr. Singletary recommends you have other over-the-counter medications on hand as well. This includes some type of decongestant in case you get stuffed up and a cough suppressant, she says. And check the expiration dates periodically. \"They don't last forever,\" she adds. (You may also want to know about top-rated items to include in a [home emergency kit](https://www.thehealthy.com/first-aid/amazon-home-emergency-kit/).) via amazon.com Hinotori Weekly Pill Organizer 3-Times-A-Day $7 Don't forget to keep a supply of your own prescription medications as well. \"The last thing you want to do during a pandemic is to go into the pharmacy to get your medications,\" says Dr. Singletary. [Skipping medications](https://www.thehealthy.com/healthcare/drugs-medicine/medication-mistakes-that-make-you-sick/), such as blood pressure drugs, could make you sicker at the very time you need to stay healthy. Other essential supplies include glucose monitors and testing strips, which are used by people with diabetes. via amazon.com AquaOasis Cool Mist Humidifier $37, 2.2 liter A humidifier moistens the air in your home, like this one from [AquaOasis](https://www.amazon.com/AquaOasisTM-Humidifier-Ultrasonic-Humidifiers-Bedroom/dp/B08FKYJHCF?tag=healthtmb-20), can also help break up congestion, especially at night which is when you're the most stuffed up, says Dr. Bhuyan. Some tips on how to use humidifiers: Choose a cool-mist humidifier (also known as a vaporizer) which doesn't run the risk of burns, place the unit several feet from your bed not right next to it, and set it to 30 percent to 50 percent humidity so things don't get too wet. \"Make sure that you are changing the water in the humidifier and that it's being cleaned regularly,\" adds Dr. Bhuyan. \"If there's a filter, change the filters as you're supposed to.\" (Learn more about how to choose the [best humidifier](https://www.thehealthy.com/cold-flu/best-humidifier/) for your space.) via amazon.com Keto Electrolyte Supplement, Salt Replacement Tablets $15, 60 capsules Staying hydrated is critical when you're sick. \"People get dehydrated when they have one of these viruses,\" says Dr. Bhuyan. Water is good but adding electrolyte salts or drinking Gatorade or another electrolyte-laden beverage like Gatorade or Powerade may be better. Or you can go for salts. \"They make powder which you can throw into bottled water,\" says Dr. Singletary. Try [SuperSalt's electrolyte supplement](https://www.amazon.com/Electrolyte-Supplement-Replacement-Rehydration-Magnesium/dp/B07JLRS82B?tag=healthtmb-20) which boasts a 4.5/5 star rating on Amazon with close to 300 reviews. One bottle contains 60 capsules and provides modest amounts of sodium, potassium, copper, zinc, and magnesium to aid in rehydration and recovery. Some signs that you don't have enough electrolytes can include feeling tired, nausea, and headache. via amazon.com Adoric Life Manual, Professional Heavy Duty Can Opener $10 The other basic-survival need, of course, is food. During a pandemic, stores may be closed or, as we learned from Covid-19, have bare shelves. The American Red Cross recommends a two-week supply (at least) of food as well as water. Make the food items easy to open with a can opener like this one from [Adoric Life](https://www.amazon.com/Opener-Manual-Professional-Stainless-Ergonomic/dp/B08CV3G5J5?tag=healthtmb-20), and choose those that don't need a lot of preparation like protein bars, peanut butter, nuts, crackers, and canned juices and soups. If you're sick, you may not feel like cooking, says Dr. Singletary With or without a pandemic, focus on wholesome foods. \"If your health status at baseline is pretty healthy, you're much more likely to have your own immune system fight this virus successfully,\" says Dr. Bhuyan. And don't forget the pet food. (These are the [canned foods nutritionists buy](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/canned-foods-nutritionists-buy-and-those-they-dont/).) via target.com Lysol Disinfecting Spray $6, 19 fluid ounces Although the flu virus spreads mostly through person-to-person contact, it also can linger on surfaces, sometimes as long as 24 hours, says Dr. Bhuyan. That's why it's so important to clean surfaces like countertops regularly, especially if someone in your house is sick. Look for a product that says on the label it is effective against influenza, like this [Lysol Disinfectant Spray](https://www.target.com/p/lysol-disinfectant-spray-19-fl-oz/-/A-53587885). And make sure it's at least 60 percent isopropyl alcohol, says Dr. Singletary. Lysol Disinfectant Spray works against H1N1 influenza, according to the company, and it's one of two products [Lysol products that kill coronavirus](https://www.thehealthy.com/infectious-disease/lysol-products-kill-coronavirus/) and is Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. via amazon.com Hydra Pearl Hand Sanitizer Gel - 70% Alcohol $28, 1 gallon If you touch a contaminated surface with your hands then touch your face, especially your nose, mouth, or eyes, you could expose yourself to the flu. Although this is less likely to happen than encountering droplets from someone's sneeze or cough, washing your hands is a key component of flu prevention. Soap and water is most effective at killing germs, says Dr. Bhuyan. However, hand sanitizer, like this one from [Hydra Pearl](https://www.amazon.com/Hydra-Pearl-Hand-Sanitizer-Gel/dp/B08FCTRGDQ?tag=healthtmb-20) is a good and easy substitute. It comes with a free 10-ounce empty travel size bottle that you can easily refill using your gallon pump. Look for products that are at least 60 percent isopropyl alcohol, says Dr. Singletary. (These are the [best hand sanitizers for dry skin](https://www.thehealthy.com/infectious-disease/best-hand-sanitizers-for-dry-skin/).) via amazon.com AmazonBasics 360-Piece Plastic Cutlery Set $15, 360 pieces Disposable utensils and paper plates will make life a lot safer and a lot easier if anyone in your household is sick.

The last word There have been several significant disease outbreaks in the last few decades. \"A lot of research is predicting we might see another pandemic in our lifetime,\" says Dr. Bhuyan. \"We have to be vigilant as we move forward. Probably the most effective tool we have is taking this seriously.\" Being prepared is part of that.
