Welcome to Harlem Chi - where NYC comes to heal. This is our 9th year in the community. We have treated thousands of patients for all types of physical, mental, and emotional ailments with the ancient Chinese medical therapies of acupuncture and herbal medicine. We are honored to evolve our practice in the footsteps of those who have come before us. It was engaged member-activists of Harlem who made this one of the very first communities in the U.S. to introduce and practice acupuncture with the holistic intent to heal the individual as a microcosm of healing a community. We are humbled to work in that light. We are a community practice committed to helping you resolve your health issues as quickly and holistically as possible, using acupuncture, herbal medicine, and nutritional counseling. All treatments are individually customized to address your specific concerns, as well as being attuned to the root causes of your ailment. In addition, we always strive to partner with our patients to not only address their initial issues, but then to also accompany them on their road to total wellness. At Harlem Chi, treatments are priced affordably, so you can make acupuncture a regular part of your health and wellness routine, not just an occasional indulgence or a last resort. Harlem Chi is your \"third space,\" where you don't just come to heal, but also to regroup, resource, rejuvenate, and find the stillness essential for building the physical strength and spiritual clarity to move constructively forward. We look forward to welcoming you soon!

My Acupuncturist Joanne is absolutely amazing! The changes in my body and life are undeniable & I know it is because of her expertise & care. She is also incredibly kind, patient, understanding, thoughtful & accommodating. I am so grateful to have Joanne & Harlem Chi as part of my wellness practice. Regular visits with Johanne at Harlem Chi has become a go-to self-care ritual for me during periods of great stress since 2018, to presently in 2022. Not only is she an expert at her craft, but Johanne also possesses the skills of paying great attention to the details of your individual and unique needs and attending to each at every visit. She is attentive, caring, consistent, supportive, and her passion for what she does is apparent. Harlem Chi is worth visiting! I've been going to Harlem Chi Community Acupuncture for digestive issues and always feel better after my visits. I think it's an affordable option to supplement your other health care practices and highly encourage people to go. The acupuncturists listen intently to what I have to say about how my body is feeling. I highly recommend this practice. I first went to Harlem Chi and saw Johanne for a pain issue I was having a few years ago. She fixed it within four visits in one week, and I had no reason to go back for a few years. I've been back for the past few months to help with some inflammatory back pain I developed. I have seen both Johanne and Diana for this, and I get wonderful improvement and relief. Each visit makes a huge difference. The clinic has a serene, spa-like atmosphere, and the visits are pleasant and relaxing. Get to a session asap! All of the aches and pains I had been feeling improved or are gone. Going to Harlem Chi is a part of my self care regiment. Consider making it a part of yours. I had chronic vertigo. For months and months. I saw many doctors and nothing helped. Tow friends of mine recommended Harlem Chi Community Acupuncture. They both had the problem is completely resolved. Sciatica. Headaches. Initially I booked three sessions per week. My vertigo symptoms have resolved in 7 sessions. I am thrilled and super relieved. The practitioners Johanne, and Dianna are fantastic. I have had such a great experience at Harlem Chi Acupuncture. Johanne has helped guide me as I've worked on correcting the last bits of tension remaining from a shoulder injury. After three years of pain, I am finding some serious relief, and also some serious stress-relief. It's very affordable for the city as well. I am so thankful I found Harlem Chi. Joanne and Dianne are awesome! They have done everything possible to help me with a lot of my symptoms after being to different specialists, getting all kinds of test done from x-rays, MRI?s and blood tests and doctors not finding anything wrong. I feel so much better since I started acupuncture at Harlem Chi. I am feeling my body getting back to normal. I am very thankful and would highly recommend Harlem Chi. Thank you Joanne and Dianne! I've been going to see Johanne for years... and I don't even live in New York! whenever I'm in the city I make it a point to see her - whatever my need is at the time (physical aches, migraines, anxiety/depression), she always takes the time to tailor my treatment to my needs. Absolutely phenomenal.
