Risk factors relating to Sanofi Sanofi presents below and under the section \" Cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements \" on page (ii) of the 2022 Annual Report on Form 20 -F, the significant risk factors to which Sanofi believes it is exposed as at the date of this Base Prospectus. The risk factors considered to be the most important, bas ed on the probability of their occurrence and the expected magnitude of their negative impact and after consideration of the effects of the measures implemented by Sanofi in order to manage these risk factors, are mentioned first in their respective catego ry and followed by an asterisk. Investors are invited to read carefully the information provided in the risk factors before investing in Sanofi's securities. Investors' attention is drawn to the fact that other risks, not identified as at the date of this Base Prospectus or whose realization is not considered likely to have, as at this same date, a significant negative impact on Sanofi's business, financial situation and results, its perspect ives, its development and/or on Sanofi's securities, may exist or occur. A. Risks Relating to Legal and regulatory matters Product liability claims could adversely affect Sanofi 's business, results of operations and financial condition* Product liability is a significant risk for any pharmaceutical company, given that liability claims relating to Sanofi' s businesses are unforeseeable by nature. The evolving regulatory environment worldwide (the ever -more stringent regulatory requirements applicable to the pharmaceutical industry, plus more stringent data, quality and supply obligations) clearly impacts Sanofi' s potential liability, and Sanofi may incur different liability claims to what it has handled in the past, with regard to their natu re, scope and level. Substantial damages have been awarded by some jurisdictions and/or settlements agreed - notably in the United States and other common law jurisdictions - against pharmaceutical companies based on claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. Such claims can also lead to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, and/or be accompanied by consumer fraud claims by customers, third -party payers seeking reimbursement of the cost of the product and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental actions. Sanofi is currently defending a number of product liability claims (see Note D.22.a.) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F) notably with respect to Taxotere\u00ae, Zantac\u00ae and Depakine\u00ae and there is a risk that the Group might not be successful in defending these claims, or that it might face additional claims in the future. Establishing the full side effect profile of a pharmaceutical drug goes beyond data derived from preapproval clinical studies which may only involve several hundred to several thousand patients. Routine review and analysis of the continually growing body of post -marketing safety data, and clinical tria ls provide additional information - for example, potential evidence of rare, population -specific or long -term adverse events or of drug interactions that were not observed in preapproval clinical studies. This causes product labeling to evolve over time, f ollowing interactions with regulatory authorities, which may include restrictions of therapeutic indications, new contraindications, warnings or precautions and occasionally even the suspension or withdrawal of a product marketing authorization. Following any of these events, pharmaceutical companies can face significant product liability claims (see Note D.22.a.) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). Furthermore, Sanofi commercializes several devices (some of which use new technologies) which, if they malfunction, could cause unexpected damage and lead to product liability claims (see \"Breaches of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could result in fin ancial, legal, business or reputational harm \" below). Although Sanofi continues to insure a portion of its product liability with third -party carriers, product liability coverage is increasingly difficult and costly to obtain, particularly in the United States. In the future, it is possible that self -insurance may become the sole commercially reasonable means available for managing the financial risk associated with product liability in Sanofi's pharmaceuticals and vaccines businesses (see \" Item 4. Informat ion on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.9. Insurance and Risk Coverage \" of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). In cases where Sanofi self -insures, the legal costs that Sanofi would bear for handling such claims and potential damage awards to be pai d to claimants, could have a negative impact on its financial condition. Due to insurance conditions, even when the Group has insurance coverage, recoveries from insurers may not be totally successful due to market -driven insurance limitations and exclusio ns. Moreover, insolvency of an insurer could affect Sanofi's ability to recover claims on policies for which Sanofi has already paid a premium. - 7 - Product liability claims, regardless of their merits or the ultimate success of the Group's defense, are costly, divert management's attention, may harm Sanofi's reputation and can impact the demand for its products and generate speculative news flows and/or rumors relating to such claims . Substantial product liability claims could materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition and/or may have an impact on market perception of Sanofi and negatively affect its stock price . Claims and investigations relating to ethics and business integrity, competition law, marketing practices, pricing, human rights of workers, data protection and other legal matters could adversely affect the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition Sanofi's industry is heavily regulated and legal requirements vary from country to country, and new requirements are imposed on Sanofi's industry from time to time. Governments and regulatory authorities around the world have been strengthening implementation and enforcement activities in recent years, including in relation to anti -bribery, anti -corruption and ethical requirements with respect to medical and scientific research, interactions with healthcare professionals and payers, respect of the human rights of workers and data protection legislation. Sanofi also operates in an envi ronment that relies on the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets of patients' and other individuals' personal information, and the opera tion of its business requires data to flow freely across borders of numerous countries. Sano fi has adopted a Code of Conduct that requires employees to comply with applicable laws and regulations, as well as the specific principles and rules of conduct set forth in the Code. Sanofi also has policies and procedures designed to help ensu re that Sanofi, its officers, employees, agents, intermediaries and other third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations (including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\" FCPA \"), the UK Bribery Act, the OECD Anti -Bribery Convention, t he French Anti -Corruption measures law (\" Sapin II \") and the French duty of vigilance law and other anti -bribery laws and regulations). Notwithstanding these efforts, failure to comply with laws and regulations (including as a result of a business partner's breach) may occur and could result in liabilities for Sanofi and/or its management. With respect to data protection legislation, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\" GDPR \") in Europe, the Personal Information Protection Law (\"PIPL \") enacted in 2021 in China , or other significant privacy legislation, including in the United States the California Consumer Privacy Act (\" CCPA \"), and case law bring legal uncertainty regarding cross border data flows. Such uncertainty could result in an operational r isk limiting or preventing the transfer of data across borders, which may have an impact on Sanofi's activities (e.g. on clinical trials). The breach of these regulations could also carry financial sanctions and may also harm Sanofi's reputation and those of its activities that rely on personal data processing. In addition, some uncertainty remains with respect to the legal and regulatory environment for these evolving privacy and data protection laws in the absence of clear guidance. Sanofi and certain of its subsidiaries could become the subject of investigations or proceedings by various government entities or could face audits and/or litigation, including allegations of corruption, claims related to employment matters, patent and intellectual property di sputes, consumer law claims and tax audits. Sanofi is currently defending itself in a number of lawsuits relating to pricing and marketing practices (including, for example, \"whistleblower\" litigation in the United States). With respect to tax issues, the complexity of the fiscal environment, is such that the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payments that are greater or less than the amounts Sanofi has accrued. See \" Item 8. Financial Information - A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information - Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings \" and Note D.22. to Sanofi's consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F. In addition, responding to such investigations is costly and may divert management's attention from its business. Unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters, or in similar matters that may arise in the future, could preclude the commercialization of its products, harm its reputation, negatively affect the pro fitability of existing products and subject Sanofi to substantial fines, punitive damages, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, potentially leading to the impos ition of additional regulatory controls, monitoring or self -reporting obligation s, or exclusion from government reimbursement programs or markets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. The unpredictability of these proceedings could lead Sanofi, after consideration of all relevant factors, to enter into settl ement agreements to settle certain claims. Such settlements may involve significant monetary payments and/or potential criminal penalties, and may include admissions of wrongdoing and may require entering into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (\" CIA\") or a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (in the United States), which is intended to regulate company behavior for a specified number of year s. For example, on 28 February 2020, Sanofi US entered into a civil settlement with the United States - 8 - Department of Justice and agreed to pay approximately $11.85 million to resolve allegations regarding certain charitable donations Sanofi US made to an in dependent patient assistance foundation that assisted patients being treated for Multiple Sclerosis. In connection with this settlement, Sanofi US also entered into a CIA with the Office of the Inspector General for the United States Department of Health a nd Human Services effective the same day which will require the Company to meet and maintain certain compliance requirements in the United States. Sanofi's activities (including its products and manufacturing activities) are subject to significant governme nt regulations and regulatory approvals, which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to its business if Sanofi fails to anticipate the regulations, comply with them, maintain the required approvals, and/or adapt to changes in applicable regulations Obtaining a marketing authorization for a product is a long and highly regulated process requiring Sanofi to present extensiv e documentation and data to the relevant regulatory authorities either at the time of the filing of the application fo r a marketing authorization or later during its review. Each regulatory authority may impose its own requirements which can evolve over time. Each regulatory authority may also delay or refuse to grant approval even though a product has already been approv ed in another country. Regulatory authorities are increasingly strengthening their requirements on product safety and risk/benef it profile s. All of these requirements, including post -marketing requirements, have increased the costs associated with maintain ing marketing authorizations. Moreover, to monitor Sanofi's compliance with applicable regulations, the FDA, EMA, WHO and comparable national agencies in other jurisdictions routinely conduct regulatory inspections of the Group facilities, distribution cen ters, commercial activities and development centers (including hospitals) and may identify potential deficiencies. For example, in November 2020, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the Biologics License Application (BLA) for sutimlim ab, an investigational monoclonal antibody being studied for the treatment of hemolysis in adults with cold agglutinin disease, referring to certain deficiencies identified by the agency during a pre -license inspection of a third -party facility responsible for manufacturing. More generally, if Sanofi fails to adequately respond to regulatory inspection observations identified during an inspection, or fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at all or within the targeted timeline, it could be subject to enforcement, remedial and/or punitive actions by the FDA (such as a Warning Letter, injunction, seizure or cease and desist order), the EMA or other regulatory authorities. In addition, Sanofi has an obligation to monitor and report adverse eve nts and safety signals. In order to comply with these duties , Sanofi must regularly train its employees and certain third parties (such as external sales forces and distributor employees) on regulatory matters, including on pharmacovigilance. If Sanofi fai ls to train these people, or fails to train them appropriately, or if they do not comply with contractual requirements, it may be exposed to the risk that safety events are n ot reported or not reported in a timely manner in breach of its reporting obligati ons. Due to geopolitical constraints, Sanofi may face delays in its clinical trials due to restrictions imposed on clinical trial sites, and/or delays in the initiation and enrollment of patients in its clinical trials, and/or disruptions related to regula tory approvals and/or delays in label expansions for existing products. Sanofi may not be able to fully mitigate these delays, which could negatively impact the timing of its pipeline development programs and may have a negative impact on its product development and launches and hence on future product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, all aspects of its business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, reimbursement, pricin g and sales, are subject t o extensive legislation and governmental regulation. Changes in applicable laws and the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on its business. For example, in response to the European Union regulations for Medical Devices (EU MDR), which entered into force in May 2021, Sanofi created the EU MDR task force. This task force was commissioned to address the risk of potential delays in approvals (for new drug -device combination products, for substantial changes to the de sign or intended purpose of the device component of already approved drug -device combination products, and for medical devices) and of product discontinuation (for some legacy medical devices), as well as compliance risks for existing products due to incre ased requirements for post - marketing surveillance, clinical evaluations, traceability and transparency. A similar task force was set up in the first qua rter of 2021 to examine risks related to the new regulations for In -Vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVDR) impl emented in May 2022. For information about risks related to changes: in proprietary rights rules and regulations, see \" Sanofi relies on its patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of its products. If such patent s and other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, Sanofi's financial results could be adversely affected \" below; and - 9 - in environmental rules and regulations, see \" Management of the historical contamination related to Sanofi's past industrial ac tivities could adversely impact its results of operations and reputation \" below . In addition, changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation or exposures to additional tax liabilities around the world could negatively impact Sanofi's operating results. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. Furthermore, most of the jurisdictions in which Sanofi operate s have double tax treaties with other foreign jurisdictions, which provide a framework for mitigating the impact of double taxation on its revenues and capital gains. However, the outcome of those mechanisms developed to resolve such conflicting claims can be uncertain and can be expected to be very lengthy. Accruals for tax contingencies are made based on experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential action s by tax authorities. However, due to the complexity of tax contin gencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payments materially different from the amounts accrued. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development ( \"OECD \") launched a new initiative to work toward a global tax framework that ensures inter alia a reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions and also introduces a global standard on minimum taxation combined with new tax dispute resolution processes. Sanofi expect s there to be a continued focus on tax refo rm, driven by initiatives by the OECD, as well as the European Union and several jurisdictions where it operate s, to address the aforementioned tax challenges, which may result in significant changes to established tax principles and an increase in tax aut hority disputes. These may be costly, divert management attention and adversely impact its reputation and relationship with key stakeholders. Sanofi relies on its patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of its pro ducts. If such patents and other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, Sanofi's financial results could be adversely affected Through patent and other proprietary rights, such as data exclusivity or supplementary protection certificates in Euro pe, Sanofi holds exclusivity rights for a number of its research -based products. However, the protection that Sanofi is able to obtain varies in its duration and scope. Furthermore, patents and other proprietary rights do not always provide effective prote ction for its products. Sanofi cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated. For example, governmental authorities are increasingly looking to facilitate generic and biosimilar competition for existing products through new regulatory proposals intended to achieve, or resulting in, changes to the scope of patent or data exclusivity rights and through the use of accelerated regulatory pathways for generic an d biosimilar drug approvals. Such regulatory proposals could make patent prosecution for new products more difficult and time consuming or could adversely affect the exclusivity period for Sanofi's products. Moreover, manufacturers of generic products or b iosimilars are increasingly seeking to challenge patent validity or coverage before the patents expire, and manufacturers of biosimilars or interchangeable versions of the products are seeking to have their version of the product approved before the exclus ivity period ends. Furthermore, in an infringement suit against a third - party, Sanofi may not prevail and the decision rendered may not conclude that its patent or other proprietary rights are vali d, enforceable or infringed. Its competitors may also succe ssfully avoid its patents. Even in cases where Sanofi ultimately prevails in an infringement claim, legal remedies available for harm caused to Sanofi by infringing products may be inadequate to make Sanofi whole. Moreover, a successful result against a co mpeting product for a given patent or in a specific country is not necessarily predictive of its future success against another competing product or in another country because of local variations in the patents and patent laws. In addition, if Sanofi loses patent protection as a result of an adverse court decision or a settlement, it faces the risk that government and private third -party payers and purchasers of pharmaceutical products may claim damages alleging they have over-reimbursed or overpaid for a d rug. For example, in 2009, in Australia, Sanofi's patent on clopidogrel was ultimately held invalid. Following this decision, the Australian Government sought damages for its alleged over -reimbursement of clopidogrel drugs due to the preliminary injunction Sanofi had secured against the sale of generic clopidogrel during the course of the litigation. The latest Australian Government's claim was dismissed following a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia on 26 June 2023. Sanofi also re lies on unpatented proprietary technology, know -how, trade secrets and other confidential information, which it seeks to protect through various measures, including confidentiality agreements with licensees, employees, third -party collaborators, and consul tants who may have access to such information. If these agreements are breached or Sanofi's other protective measures should fail, then its contractual or other remedies may not be adequate to cover its losses. - 10 - In certain cases, to terminate or avoid paten t litigation, Sanofi or its collaboration partners may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of third -party intellectual property rights. Any payments under these licenses may reduce Sanofi's profits from such products and Sanofi may not be able to obtain these licenses on favorable terms or at all. Third parties may also request a preliminary or permanent injunction in a country from a court of law to prevent Sanofi from marketing a product if they consider that Sanofi infringes their patent righ ts in that country. If third parties obtain a preliminary or permanent injunction or if Sanofi fails to obtain a required license for a country where valid third -party intellectual property rights as confirmed by a court of law exist, or if Sanofi is unab le to alter the design of its technology to fall outside the scope of third -party intellectual property rights, Sanofi may be unable to market some of its products in certain countries, which may limit its profitability. In addition, the pursuit of valid b usiness opportunities may require Sanofi to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that it believe s were improperly granted, including through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges may not always be successful. Third parties may cl aim that Sanofi's products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them. Claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time -consuming to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant royalty paym ents or damages. Furthermore, some countries may consider granting a compulsory license to a third -party to use patents protecting an innovator's product, which limits the value of the patent protection granted to such products. Sanofi has increased the pr oportion of biological therapeutics in its pipeline relative to traditional small molecule pharmaceutical products. Typically, the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of biological therapeutics is complicated by third -party intellectual propert y rights (otherwise known as freedom to operate (FTO) issues), to a greater extent than for the small molecule therapeutics, because of the types of patents allowed by national patent offices. Further, its ability to successfully challenge third -party pate nt rights is dependent on the legal interpretation and case law of national courts. In addition, Sanofi expects to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. With the accelerated regul atory pathways provided in the United States and Europe for biosimilar drug approval, biosimilars can be a threat to the exclusivity of any biological therapeutics Sanofi sells or may market in the future and can pose the same issues as the small molecule generic threat described above. If a biosimilar version of one of Sanofi's products were to be approved, it could reduce its sales and/or profitability of that product. Sanofi currently hold s trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third -party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As Sanofi's products mature, its reliance on its trademarks and trade dress to differentiate it from its competitors increases and, as a result, its business could be adversely affected if it is unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate its rights. If Sanofi's pat ents and/or proprietary rights to its products were limited or circumvented, its financial results could be adversely affected. B. Risks relating to Sanofi 's business The pricing and reimbursement of Sanofi's products is negatively affected by increasing cost containment pressures and decisions of governmental authorities and other third parties* The commercial success of Sanofi's existing products and its product candidates depends in part on their pricing and reimbursement conditions . Its products are negatively affected by continued downward pricing pressure and scrutiny due, inter alia, to: stricter price and access controls imposed by governments and other payers around the world : o requirements for greater transparency around drug pricing and drug development costs, o widespread use of international reference pricing and therapeutic reference pricing, among other pricing methodologies and caps, o mandatory price cuts, renegotiations, industry payback and rebates, o delisting from reimbursement and restrictions on the label population, o access restrictions for high -priced innovative medicines, o prescr ibing guidelines and binding medicine utilization controls, o greater use of tendering and centralized procurement (national/regional/class -wide level), - 11 - o cross -country cooperation in price negotiations, contracting or procurement, which is already occurring t o some extent (for example , the COVID -19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX ) initiative, the BeNeLuxA alliance in Europe; and the Pan American Health Organisation ( PAHO )), o shifting of the payment burden to US patients and access disruptions through co-pay accumulator and maximizer programs as well as alternative funding programs, o increased utilization management and restrictive formularies (including stepped therapy, strict prior authorization criteria, formulary exclusions) mainly by US insurers and pharma cy benefits managers (PBMs), o discriminatory and non -transparent pricing and procurement policies (e.g. government procurement restrictions, import bans) in favor of domestic pharmaceutical companies ; widespread use of health technology assessment (\" HTA \") to inform coverage and reimbursement decisions: o more stringent evidence and value requirements (e.g. comparative effectiveness, patient preferences, real - world evidence, health economic modelling) by payers and HTA authorities, raising the bar for ma rket entry, o unreasonable thresholds for cost -effectiveness, and o increasingly restrictive HTA decisions with significant variation across markets; increased generic and biosimilar competition, accelerating price erosion: o next-generation of biosimilars comin g to the market across major therapeutic areas, o potential savings from increased biosimilar use , expected to be a cumulative $285 billion globally through 2025 according to the IQVIA Institute, and o evolving regulatory landscapes to support interchangeability (e.g. in the US and EU) and pharmacy substitution (e.g. in the EU Nordic countries, Germany and France). In the United States, which accounted for 42.5% of Sanofi's net sales in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted in Aug ust 2022 with drug pricing provisions that became effective in 2022, and will become effective in 2025 and 2026. Key policies related to federal government price negotiations, inflation penalties and Medicare Part D benefit redesign are likel y to have a ne gative impact on industry revenue growth and future innovation, though there remains significant uncertainty over the negotiation provision and the impact of Medicare reforms. In addition, the continuing vertical integration and consolidation of the US hea lth insurance market exposes the industry to greater pricing pressure. With the three largest pharmacy benefit manager group purchasing organizations (PBM GPOs) (i.e. Ascent, Emisar and Zinc) now covering over 85% of prescription drug claims, consolidation has led to increased utilization management and restrictive formularies, resulting in strong bargaining power to negotiate discounted prices, thereby adversel y impacting Sanofi's sales. Other risks include the increasing focus on price transparency, persistent supply chain challenges due to high dependency on active pharmaceuticals ingredients (\"API\") imports and interest in \"Buy American\" procurement rules. If Sanofi had to source APIs f rom the US, where they are more expensive than in other countries, the current cost containments would not allow it to reflect the corresponding increase on its prices which would impact the margins on its products. Other risks also include continued growt h of the federal 340B drug pricing program. In China, Sanofi continue s to face increasing local competition. Price pressure is likely to intensify across its portfolio as a growing number of its products are subject to national reimbursement drug list ( \"NRDL\") price negotiations and national volume -based procurement ( \"VBP \") tenders, with the lowest prices prevailing. Innovative oncology products, in particular, are experiencing additional access challenges, as seen with the exclusion of imported PD -1 inhibi tors from the NRDL in the last two years, in favor of domestically developed treatments. Further expansion of the VBP policy to biologics and biosimila rs also poses a growing threat to Sanofi's key established products, with over 500 drugs targeted for inc lusion by 2025. In Europe, there are risks of tighter cost -containment policies exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic, rising inflation and volatile energy prices. Industry payback and mandatory rebates are expected to increase at unprecedented rates in 202 3 in major EU markets, particularly in Germany and the UK. At EU level, there continue to be growing concerns over the current direction of the European Commission's wide -ranging Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, and the related ongoing review of intelle ctual property protections and the Orphan Medicines Regulation. The policies under consideration could have a far -reaching impact on Sanofi's Rare Diseases pipelines, and have the potential to jeopardize incentives for EU innovation and competitiveness. Sanofi will pursue its current efforts - 12 - towards shaping and improving the EU pharmaceutical legislation, while creating the conditions of an EU biopharma innovation ecosystem, based on a vision combining pharmaceutical and industrial strategies. In addition, significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact of the EU HTA Regulation by 2025. Sanofi created an internal EU HTA task force in early 2022 in order to engage with stakeholders with one voice and ensure preparedness for the new EU framework. Furtherm ore, the EU joint procurement initiative aimed at combining the procurement actions of two or more contracting authorities, as used in the context of COVID -19 pandemic, may gain traction outside the health emergency context, in particular for high -cost med icines and vaccines. Sanofi therefore anticipate greater pricing pressure and potential risk of net price transparency. This could have an impact an impact on Sanofi's Specialty Care portfolio, especially for oncology and rare diseases. Sanofi's research and development efforts may not succeed in adequately renewing its product portfolio* Discovering and developing a new product is a costly, lengthy and uncertain proces s. To be successful in the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry, Sanofi must commit substantial resources each year to research and development in order to develop new products to compensate for decreasing sales of products facing patent expiration a nd termination of regulatory data exclusivity, introduction of lower -priced generics, or competition from new products of competitors that are perceived as being superior or equivalent to Sanofi products. Sanofi must pursue both early -stage research and ea rly and late development stages in order to propose a sustainable and well -balanced portfolio of products. In 202 2, Sanofi spent \u20ac 6,706 million on research and development, amounting to 15. 6% of its net sales. Failure to invest in the right technology plat forms, therapeutic areas, product classes, geographic markets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of Sanofi's pipeline. Sanofi prioritizes five potentially transformative therapies in areas of high unmet patient need: fit and tolebrutinib (multiple sclerosis). Sanofi also announced its decision to discontinue its research efforts in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and refocus its R&D strategy on oncology, immunology and inflammation, multiple sclerosis , neurology and rare diseases an d rare blood disorders. In 2021, Sanofi acquired Translate Bio to accelerate the deployment of mRNA technology for the development of new vaccines, including for seasonal influenza, and beyond vaccines, therapeutics where there is a strong unmet medical ne ed. However, mRNA technology is still in its early days and the ability of this technology to produce strong results and safety still remains to be fully asserted. Sanofi may also fail to improve its development productivity sufficiently to sustain its pip eline (see also \" Sanofi may fail to successfully identify external business opportunities or realize the anticipated benefits from its strategic investments or divestments \" below). Other new innovations under investigations, such as natural killer (NK) cel ls and conditionally activated biologics, raise similar uncertainties. In addition, the competitive landscape includes a high level of uncertainty as numerous companies are working on or may be evaluating similar targets and a product considered as promis ing at the beginning of its development may become less attractive if a competitor addressing the same unmet need reaches the market earlier. There is a risk that some of Sanofi's product candidates might be proven unsafe or ineffective (see \" Item 4. Infor mation on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.5. Global Research & Development \" of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). Over these research and development cycles usually spanning several years, there is a substantial risk at each stage of development including pre -clinical activities and clinical trials - that Sanofi will not achieve its goals of safety and/or efficacy and that Sanofi will have to abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts of money and human resources. For instance, in 2022 patient enrollment of Phase III tolebrutinib trials paused globally after a decision of the FDA regarding potential side effects. As another example, the global clinical development program of amcenestrant (breast cancer) was discontinued in August 2022 following the outcome of the prespecified interim analysis of a Phase III trial. More a nd more trials are designed with clinical endpoints of superiority; failure to achieve those endpoints could damage the product's outlook and Sanofi's overall development program. Decisions concerning the studies to be carried out can have a significant i mpact on the marketing strategy for a given product. Multiple in -depth studies can demonstrate that a product has additional benefits, facilitating the product's marketing, but such studies are expensive and time consuming and may delay the product's submi ssion to regulatory authorities for approval. In addition, following (or in some cases contemporaneously with) the marketing authorization, the dossier is also submitted t o governmental agencies and/or national or regional third -party payers HTA bodies) fo r review. These HTA bodies evaluate evidence on the value of the new product, assess the medical need it serves and provide recommendations on the corresponding reimbursement. Such analyses may require additional studies, including comparative studies, whi ch may effectively delay marketing, change the population which the new product treats, and add costs to its development. Sanofi's continuous - 13 - investments in research and development for future products and for the launches of newly registered molecules cou ld therefore result in increased costs without a proportionate increase in revenues, which would negatively affect Sanofi's operating resu lts and profitability. Lastly, there is a risk that some products approved or launched might not achieve commercial su ccess. In addition, even after a product reaches the market, certain developments following regulatory approval may decrease demand for Sanofi's products. Clinical trials and post -marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs have the potential to raise concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety or efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general, which could negatively affect the sales of such products or lead to increased volatility in market reaction. Breaches of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could result in financial, legal, competitive, operational, business or reputational harm* Sanofi's business depends heavily on the use of interdependent information technology systems includi ng internet -based systems and digital tools. Certain key areas such as research and development, production and sales are to a large extent dependent on Sanofi information systems (including cloud -based computing) or those of third -party providers (includi ng for the storage and transfer of critical, confidential, sensitive or personal information regarding its patients, clinical trials , vendors, customers, employees, collaborators and others). Sanofi is therefore vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and inci dents and misuse or manipulation of any of these IT systems could result in exposure of confidential information or the modification of critical data. Sanofi and its third -party service providers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors or other co ntracting third parties use, to the best of its ability, secure information technology systems for the protection of data and threat detection. Like many companies, Sanofi may experience certain of the following events which pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Sanofi's sensitive data: breakdown, outages, se rvice disruption or impairment, data loss or deterioration in the event of a system malfunction, or increasi ng threat of data theft or corruption in the event of a cyber -attack, security breach, industrial espionage attacks, insider threat attacks, cybercrimes, including state -sponsored cybercrimes, malware, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events. Also, in the event of an attack, U .S. and European legislation related to the financing of terrorism imposes increasing restrictions on payments of ransom. As a result, Sanofi's ability to recover the data might be limited. Therefore, its busine ss continuity could be at risk if Sanofi is unab le to recover data through back -ups and restorations. Each of these events could negatively impact important processes, such as scientific research and clinical trials, the submis sion of outcomes to health authorities for marketing authorizations, the functioning of production processes and the supply chain, compliance with legal requirements, trade secrets, security strategies and other key activities, including Sanofi's employees ' ability to communicate between themselves as well a s with third parties (see also \" Product liability claims could adversely affect Sanofi's business, results of operations and financial condition \" above). This could result in material financial, legal, competitive, operational, business or reputational har m. Although Sanofi maintains relevant insurance coverage, this insurance may not be sufficiently available in the future to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of its systems. For exam ple, certain types of cyber -attacks could be considered as an Act of War subject to insurance exclusion. The manufacture of Sanofi's products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or inventory losses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversely affect its operating results and financial condition, delay the launch of new products and negatively impact its image* Many of Sanofi's products are manufactured using technically complex processes with production constraints, including the need for specialized facilities, trained and certified employees, and highly specific raw materials. Sanofi must ensure that all manufacturing processes comply with (i) current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), (ii) other applicable regula tions issued by governmental health authorities around the world, as well as (iii) Sanofi's own quality standards. Third parties su pply Sanofi with a portion of its raw materials, active ingredients and medical devices, which exposes Sanofi to the risk of a supply shortage or interruption in the event that these suppliers are unable to manufacture its products in line with quality standa rds or if they experience financial difficulties. For example, in 2021 Genzyme sold a manufacturing facility located in Al lston Landing in the United States to a third party, which is in particular involved in the production of Cerezyme\u00ae. Sanofi now relies on that third party for certain manufacturing and testing operations pursuant to the terms and conditions of relevant con tractual - 14 - agreements with such third party. The manufacturing and testing operations performed on Genzyme's behalf at the Allston Landing facility are subject to the terms of a consent decree requiring ongoing compliance therewith, which was entered into between Genzyme and the US government in 2010. Sanofi now relies on the third party that acquired the Allston Landing site to perform manufacturing and testing services on its behalf and to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the aforementione d consent decree. Sanofi could be subject to product supply risk if the third party is unable to supply product to it and to regulatory action if the third -party acquirer of the Allston Landing site fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, inc luding cGMP, when performing the relevant services. Epidemics and other public health crises, such as the COVID -19 pandemic, expose Sanofi to risks of a slowdown or temporary suspension in the production of its API s, raw materials and some of its products. Any prolonged restrictive measures put in place in order to control an outbreak of contagious disease or other adverse public health development, in any of its princip al production sites, may have a material and adverse effect on its manufacturing operati ons. Any of these factors could adversely affect Sanofi's business, operating results or financial condition (see \" Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8. Production and Raw Materials \" of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F for a d escription of these outsourcing arrangements and \" The extent to which the COVID -19 pandemic and related developments, including measures implemented in response thereto, may adversely impact Sanofi's business, operations and financial performance remains uncertain \" below). Sanofi's business may require the transformation and adaptation of its plants in order to ensure the continuity of production of its products in sufficient quantities to satisfy demand. This may be necessary to meet the need for the production of new products, including biologics, or to ensure the scaling up production of products under development once approved. This need may also result from new regulatory requirements; for example, the fact that insulin is no longer regulated b y the FDA as a drug but rather as a biologic requires significant transformation and adaptation of Sanofi's insulin manufacturing plant in Frankfurt, with no guarantee that Sanofi will manage to complete that plan within the expected time. Furthermore, San ofi's biological products, in particular, are subject to the risk of manufacturing stoppages or the risk of loss of inventory becau se of the difficulties inherent in the processing of biological materials and the potential difficulties in accessing adequat e amounts of raw materials meeting required standards. In addition, specific storage and distribution conditions are required for many biological products (for example, cold storage is required for certain vaccines, insulin -based products and some hemophil ia products). These production difficulties may also be encountered during testing, which is a mandatory requirement prior to drug products being released. For example, in early 2022, Sanofi encountered supply constraints of Kevzara\u00ae (sarilumab) due to an increase in the global demand for IL -6 receptor blockers and the tocilizumab shortage announced in mid -August 2021. Sanofi therefore needed to prioritize access for indicated pat ients with rheumatoid arthritis . The complexity of Sanofi's production process es, as well as standards required for the manufacture of its products, subject Sanofi to risks because the investigation and remediation of any identified or suspected problems can cause production delays , substantial expense, product recalls or lost sales and inventories, and delay the launch of new products; this could adversely affect Sanofi's operating results and financial condition, and cause reputational damage and the risk of product liability (see - \"Product liability claims could adversely affect Sanofi's business, results of operations and financial condition \" above). In addition, some of Sanofi's production sites, and some of its suppliers' and/or contractors' sites, are located in areas exposed to natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes an d hurricanes. Such disasters could be exacerbated by climate change. In the event of a major disaster, Sanofi could experience severe destruction or interruption of its operations and production capacity at these sites. When manufacturing disruptions occur , Sanofi may not have alternate manufacturing capacity, particularly for certain biologics. In the event of manufacturing disruptions, Sanofi's ability to use backup facilities or set up new facilities is m ore limited because biologics are more complex to manufacture and generally require dedicated facilities. Even though Sanofi aims to have backup sources of supply whenever possible, including by manufacturing backup supplies of its principal active ingredients at additional facilities when practicable, Sa nofi cannot be certain they will be sufficient if its principal sources become unavailable. Switching sources and manufacturing facilities requires significant time and prior approval by health authorities. Supply shortages generate even greater negative r eactions when they occur with respect to life saving medicines with limited or no viable therapeutic alternatives. Shortages of specific products can have a negative impact on the confidence of patient s, customers and professional healthcare providers and the image of the Group and may lead to lower product revenues. A substantial share of the revenue and income of Sanofi depends on the performance of certain flagship products* - 15 - As part of the presentation of its strategy in December 2019 Sanofi announced its intent to prioritize its activities on growth drivers including Dupixent\u00ae and its Vaccines operations, which have been identified as key growth drivers. Nevertheless market expansion and new launches of medicines and vaccines may not deliver the expected benefits. Sanofi may also encounter failures or delays in its launch strategy (in terms of timing, pricing, market access, marketing ef forts and dedicated sales forces), such that Sanofi's products that may not deliver the expected benefits. T he competitive environment for a given product may also have changed by the time of the actual launch, modifying Sanofi's initial expectations. The need to prioritize the allocation of resources may also cause delays in or hamper the launch or expansion o f some of Sanofi's products. Also Sanofi currently generates a substantial share of its net sales from certain key products (see \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - A.2. Results of Operations - Year ended 31 December 202 2 compared with y ear ended 31 December 20 22 - A.2.1.3/Net Sales - Pharmaceuticals segment \"). For example, Dupixent\u00ae generated net sales of \u20ac 8,293 million in 202 2 representing 1 9.3% of Sanofi's net sales for the year and is the Group's biggest product in terms of sale. Amon g its flagship products, Lantus\u00ae, Lovenox\u00ae and Plavix\u00ae already face generic competition on the market. Lantus\u00ae is particularly important; it was one of Sanofi's leading products in 202 2 with net sales of \u20ac2, 259 million. Aubagio\u00ae, another leading product, i s expected to face generic competition in the US starting from March 2023, following a settlement agreement entered into in 2017. In Europe, Aubagio\u00ae generic competition is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023. Jevtana\u00ae faced generic competition since th e end of March 2021 in Europe. More generally, an expiration of effective intellectual property protections for its products typically results in the market entry of one or more lower -priced generic competitors, often leading to a rapid and significant dec line in revenues on those products (for information regarding ongoing patent litigation see Note D.22.b) to the consolidated financial statements included at It em 18 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). The introduction of a generic product results in adverse price and volume effects for the branded, or genericized products. For example, although Sanofi does not believe it is possible to state with certainty what level of net sales would have been achi eved in the absence of generic competition, a compar ison of its consolidated net sales for 2022 and 2021 for the main products affected by generic and biosimilar competition shows a loss of \u20ac 325 million of net sales on a reported basis (see \" Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - A.1.2. Impacts of Competition from Generics and Biosimilars \" of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). However, other parameters may have contributed to the loss of sales, such as a fall in the average price of certain products (e.g. Lantus\u00ae). Furthermore, in general, if one or more of its flagship products were to encounter problems (such as material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, product recalls, non -approval by the health authorities of a new indication for a marketed product, pri cing pressure and manufacturing or supply issues), the adverse impact on its business, results of operations and financial condition could be significant. Sanofi relies on third parties for the discovery, manufacture, marketing and distribution of some of its products Sanofi's industry is both highly collaborative and competitive, whether in the discovery and development of new products, in - licensing, the marketing and distribution of approved products, or manufacturing activities. Sanofi expects that it wi ll continue to rely on third parties for key aspects of its business and Sanofi needs to ensure its attractiveness as a potential partner . Sanofi conducts a number of significant research and development programs and market some of its products in collabor ation with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. For example, Sanofi currently has a global strategic collaboration with Regeneron on monoclonal antibodies for the development and commercialization of Dupixent\u00ae, Kevzara\u00ae (sarilumab) and SAR4403 40 (REGN3500 - itepekimab) (see \" Item 5. Financial Presentation of Alliances \u2014 A.1.7.1/ Alliance Arrangements with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc \"). Sanofi relies upon Regeneron to successfully carry out their responsibilities with regard to the manufacture and supply of these collaboration antibodies (see \" Item 4. Information on the Company \u2014 B. Business Overview \" of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). Finally, Sanofi may also rely on partners to design and manufacture medical devices, notably for the admi nistration of its products. As regards products recently launched or under development for which Sanofi has a collaboration agreement with partners, the terms of the applicable alliance agreement may require Sanofi to share profits and losses arising from commercialization of such products with its partners. This differs from the treatment of revenue and costs generated by other products for whic h Sanofi has no alliance agreement, and such profit sharing may deliver a lower contribution to its financial re sults. - 16 - Sanofi could also be subject to the risk that it may not properly manage the decision -making process with its partners. Decisions may be controlled by or subject to the approval of its collaboration partners, who may have views that differ from Sano fi's. Sanofi is also subject to the risk that its partners may not perform effectively, which could have a detrimental effect when our collaboration partners are responsible for the performance of certain key tasks or functions, for example related to manu facturing. Any such failures in the development process or differing priorities may adversely affect Sanofi's business including the activities conducted through the collaboration arrangements. Sanofi also cannot guarantee that third -party manufacturers wi ll be able to meet its near -term or long -term manufacturing requirements. For instance, f ollowing the completion of the spin -off of EUROAPI in May 2022, EUROAPI became a third -party manufacturer and will continue to manufacture a certain number of APIs for Sanofi . Sanofi is also subject to the risk that contract research organizations or other vendors (for instance regarding digital activities) retained by it or its collaboration partners may not perform effectively. Sanofi could face conflicts or difficult ies with its partners during the course of these agreements or at the time of their renewal or renegotiation , or any disruption in the relationships with its partners may affect the development, manufacturing, launch and/or marketing of certain of its prod ucts or product candidates and may cause a decline in its revenues or otherwise negatively affect its results of operations. Sanofi is subject to the risk of non -payment by its customers2 Sanofi runs the risk of delayed payments or even non -payment by its customers, which consist principally of wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. This risk is accentuated by recent concentrations among distribut ors and retailers, as well as by uncertainties around global credit and economic conditions, in particular in emerging markets. As a result, Sanofi may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of such customers. The United States poses particular customer credit risk issues because of the concentrated distribution system: Sanofi's three main customers represented respectively 1 2%, 8% and 7% of its consolidated net sales in 202 2. Sanofi is also exposed to large wholesalers in other markets, particu larly in Europe. An inability of one or more of these wholesalers to honor their debts to Sanofi could adversely affect its financial condition (see Note D.34. to Sanofi's consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2022 Annual Report on F orm 20 -F). In some countries, some customers are public or subsidized health systems. The economic and credit conditions in these countries may lead to an increase in the average length of time needed to collect on accounts receivable or the ability to co llect 100% of receivables outstanding. Because of this context, Sanofi may need to reassess the recoverable amount of its debts in these countries during future financial years. Global economic conditions and an unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for Sanofi's business3 Over the past several years, growth of the global pharmaceutical market has become increasingly tied to global economic growth. In this context, a substantial and lasting slowdown of the global economy, ma jor national economies or emerging markets could negatively affect growth in the global pharmaceutical market and, as a result, adversely affect Sanofi's busine ss. For example, unpredictable political conditions that currently exist in various parts of the world could have a material negative impact on its business. In particular, armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalated in 2022. The degree of impact of the war between Russia and Ukraine is difficult to predict and will depend on developments out side Sanofi's control, including, but not limited to the duration and severity of the conflict, and the consequences of the ongoing and additional financial an d economic sanctions imposed by governments in response. Other related issues have arisen or are arising such as regional instability; geopolitical uncertainties; adverse effects on fuel and energy costs, supply chains, macroeconomic conditions, inflation, and currency exchange rates in various regions of the world; and exposure of third parties to ga s shortages. Collectively, such unstable conditions could, among other things, disturb the international flow of goods and increase the co sts and difficulties associated with international transactions. Unfavorable economic conditions have reduced the sou rces of funding for national social security systems, leading to austerity measures including heightened pressure on drug prices, increased substitution of generic drugs, and the exclusion of certain 2 The information in this section supplements the disclosures required under IFRS 7 as presented in Notes B.8.7., D.10. and D.34. to the consolidated financial statements, provided at Item 18 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F. 3 The information in this section supplements the disclosures required under IFRS 7 as presented in Note B.8.7. to the consolidated financial statements, provided at Item 18 of the 2022 Annual Report on Form 20 -F. - 17 - products from formularies among others (see \"- The prici ng and reimbursement of Sanofi's products is negatively affected by increasing cost containment pressures and decisions of governments and other third parties \" above). Further, Sanofi's net sales may be negatively impacted by the continuing challenging global economic environment, as high unemployment, increases in cost -sharing, and lack of developed third -party payer systems in certain regions may lead some patients to switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use other tre atments to reduce their costs. In the United States there has been a significant increase in the number of beneficiaries in the Medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many US states, to formulary r estrictions limiting access to brand - name drugs, including Sanofi's. Also, employers may seek to transfer a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees due to rising costs, which could lead to further downward price pressure and/or lower demand. Sanofi's Consumer Healthcare business could also be adversely impacted by difficult economic conditions as the financial resources of its customers may be reduced as a result of the economic situation . If economic conditions worsen, or in the event of def ault or failure of major players including wholesalers or public sector buyers financed by insolvent states, the financial situation of the Group, the profitability and results of its operations an d the distribution channels of its products may be adversel y affected. See also \" Sanofi is subject to the risk of non -payment by its customers \" above. The extent to which the COVID -19 pandemic and related developments, including measures implemented in response thereto, may adversely impact Sanofi's business, oper ations and financial performanc e remains uncertain Sanofi is unable to predict the impact on its business, operations and financial results that the COVID -19 pandemic would have if it continued or resumed with force, including insofar it could lead to lowe r sales and reduced patient demand and usage of certain of its products. While economies around the world tend to reopen their economies, the degree to which COVID -19 adversely impacts Sanofi's results in the future is outside the Company's knowledge or co ntrol and will depend on the evolution of the outbreak, its mutation, its severity, the actions taken by government authorities to contain the virus or mitigate its impact, and how quic kly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can res ume. Any resurgence in COVID -19 infections or emergence of new epidemics could result in the imposition of new constraints and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. In an increasingly budget -constrained h ealthcare environment as economic disruption have continued due to the pandemic, Sanofi expect s to see a higher pressure on drug prices worldwide and, in the longer term, a reallocation of funding across therapeutic areas, driven in particular by evolving public health priorities, which could negatively impact its business operations (see \"The pricing and reimbursement of Sanofi's products is negatively affected by increasing cost containment pressures and decisions of governmental authorities and other third parties \" above). For example, the pandemic may reduce Sanofi's sales in targeted markets due to lower healthcare spending on other diseases and fewer promotional activities. The global COVID -19 pandemic has also exposed Sanofi to a disruption o r temporary suspension in production of APIs, raw materials and some of other products. A revival of the COVID -19 pandemic or any other pandemic could expose Sanofi to a revival of this risk. Extension of the restrictive measures put in place in order to c ontrol the pandemic may lead to manufacturing delays or disruptions and supply chain interruptions (including to the extent those measures apply to Sanofi's third-party suppliers) and may have an adverse effect on its business (see \"The manufacture of Sano fi's products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or inventory losses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversel y affect its operating results and financial condition, delay the launch of new products and negativel y impact its image \" above). Also, a sudden increase in demand for selected medicinal products can result in short -term unavailability or shortages of raw materials. Finally, Sanofi cannot predict or reasonably estimate the impact of any potential long -term changes to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries from the COVID -19 pandemic. The increasing use of social media platforms and new technologies present risks and challenges for Sanofi's business and reputation Sanofi increasingly relies on social m edia, new technologies and digital tools to communicate about its products and about diseases or to provide health services. The use of these media requires specific attention, monitoring programs and moderatio n of comments. Political and market pressures may be generated by social media because of rapid news cycles. This may result in commercial harm, overly restrictive regulatory actions and erratic share price performance. In addition, unauthorized - 18 - communications, such as press releases or posts on socia l media, purported to be issued by Sanofi, may contain information that is false or otherwise damaging and could have an adverse impact on its image and reputation and on its stock price. Negative or inaccurate posts or comments about Sanofi, its business, directors or officers on any social networking website could seriously damage its reputation. In addition, its employees and partners may use social media and mobile technologies inappropriately, which may give rise to liability for the Group, or which co uld lead to breaches of data security, loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property or public disclosure of sensitive information. Such uses of social media and mobile technologies could have an adverse effect on Sanofi's reputation, business, fina ncial condition and results of operations. C. Risks relating to Sanofi 's structure and strategy Sanofi may fail to successfully identify external business opportunities or realize the anticipated benefits from its strateg ic investments or divestments* Sanofi pursues a strategy of selective acquisitions, in -licensing and collaborations in order to reinforce its pipeline and portfolio. Sanofi is also proceeding to selective divestments to focus on key business areas. The implementation of thi s strategy depends on the Group's ability to identify transaction opportunities, mobilize the appropriate resources in order to enter in to agreements in a timely manner and execute these transactions on acceptable economic terms. Moreover, entering into in - licensing or collaboration agreements generally requires the payment of significant \" milestones \" well before the relevant products reach the market, without any assurance that such investments will ultimately become profitable in the long term (see Note D.21.1. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F and also \"Sanofi relies on third parties for the discovery, manufacture, marketing and distribution of some of its products \" above). Once a strategi c transaction is agreed upon with a third party, we may not be able to complete the transaction in a timely manner or at all. For newly acquired activities or businesses Sanofi's growth objectives could be delayed or ultimately not realized, and expected synergies could be adversely impacted if, for example: Sanofi is unable to quickly or efficiently integrate those activities or businesses; key employees leave; or Sanofi has higher than anticipated integration costs. For instance, in 2019 Sanofi had to book a \u20ac2.8 billion impairment on Eloctate\u00ae acquired through the Bioverativ acquisition completed in 2018 due to revisions of previous sales projections. As another example, the Translate Bio acquisition referred to above which was completed in 2021 may no t generate the expected results in terms of developing new mRNA -based products to meet existing or future needs, and the potential of Translate Bio's mRNA platform may not be realized to its full extent or because of the difficulty of integrating the activ ity quickly and efficiently into the Group. Sanofi may also miscalculate the risks associated with business development transactions at the time they are made or may lack the resources or ability to access all the relevant information to evaluate such risk s properly, including with regard to the potential of research and development pipelines, manufacturing issues, tax or accounting issues, compliance issues, or the outcome of ongoing legal and other proceedings. It may also take a considerable amount of ti me and be difficult to implement a risk analysis and risk mitigation plan after the acquisition of an activity or business is completed due to lack of histori cal data. Acquired businesses may not always be in full compliance with legal, regulatory or Sanof i standards, including, for example, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), which can be costly and time consuming to remedy. As a result, risk management and coverage of such risks, particularly through insurance policies, may prove to be insufficie nt or ill-adapted. With respect to divestments, their financial benefit could be impacted if Sanofi faces significant financial claims or signif icant post-closing price adjustments. Furthermore, the value of the assets to be divested may deteriorate while Sanofi is in the pr ocess of executing its divestment strategy, with the risk that Sanofi does not realize the anticipated benefits. Because of the active competition among pharmaceutical groups for business development opportunities, the Group might not be successful in com pleting these transactions when such opportunities are identified. The globalization of the Group's business exposes it to increased risks in specific areas* As part of the presentation of its strategy in December 2019, Sanofi identified its strong presenc e in China among its core drivers with a revenue amounting to 7. 3% of its net sales in 202 2. - 19 - Nevertheless, the difficulties in operating in emerging markets, a significant decline in the anticipated growth rate or an unfavorable movement of the exchange ra tes of currencies against the euro could impair Sanofi's ability to take advantage of growth opportunities and could adversely affect Sanofi's business, results of operations or financial condition. For instance , while it continues to be impossible as of t he date of this report to predict the economic impact and the magnitude of the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, if a long -lasting epidemic and prolonged or repeated restrictive measures to control the outbreak were to result in an economic slowdown in any of San ofi's targeted markets, it would reduce its sales due to lower healthcare spending on other diseases and fewer promotional activities, and could significantly impact its business operations. Furthermore, it is not possible to predict if or how the current health crisis will impact any particular affected jurisdiction, or to what extent. (see also \" Global economic conditions and an unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for Sanofi's business \" and \" The extent to which the COVID -19 pandemic and related developments, including measures implemented in response thereto, may adversely impact Sanofi's business, operations and financial performance remains uncertain \" above). Emerging markets also expose Sanofi to more volatile economic con ditions, political instability (including a backlash in certain areas against free trade), competition from multinational or locally based companies that are already well established in the se markets, the inability to adequately respond to the unique chara cteristics of emerging markets (particularly with respect to their underdeveloped judicial systems and regulatory frameworks), difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel or maintaini ng the necessary internal control systems, potential exchange controls , weaker intellectual property protection, higher crime levels (particularly with respect to counterfeit products), and compliance issues including corruption and fraud (see particularly \"Claims and investigations relating to ethics and business integrity, competition law, marketing practices, pricing, human rights of workers, data protection and other legal matters could adversely affect the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition \" above). Sanofi may fail to develop or take advantag e of digitalization and prioritizing data as an organizational asset * Sanofi has undertaken a number of digital initiatives . Examples include the opening in March 2022 of Sanofi's Accelerator, an internal unit that functions like a startup within Sanofi to develop products and solutions that will support its mission to transform the practice of medicine with the use of digital, data and artificial intelligence; the Future4Care init iative of June 2021, where Sanofi joined a startup incubator along with other CAC40 companies to help nurture the latest and greatest in health tech; its enabled manufacturing facility in the US and its Darwin real -world data platform. Sanofi's success in these efforts will depend on many factors, including data quality, technology architecture, entering into successful partnerships a nd alliances with technology companies, a profound transformation of the organization, including a cultural change among its employees and the development of relevant skills , attracting and retaining employees with appropriate skills and mindsets in a tight labour market , and successfully innovating across a variety of technology fields. The COVID -19 pandemic has accelerated San ofi's digital transformation, including in the ways it engages and interacts with its stakeholders. However there is no guarantee that Sanofi's efforts toward a digital transformation will succeed. More generally, Sanofi may fail to captur e the benefits of digitalization and valuing data as an enterprise asset at an appropriate cost and/or in a timely manner and/or enter into appropriate partnerships. Competitors, including new entrants such as tech companies, may outpace Sanofi in this fast -moving area. I f Sanofi fails to adequately integrate digital capabilities into its organization and business model, Sanofi could lose patients and market share. This could have an adverse impact on its business, prospects and results of operations. The success of digita l initiatives will also depend on Sanofi's ability to shift its culture to a data -driven culture. This calls for clear ownership and a collectively -owned operating model with supporting tools and competencies to manage data as an asset, and for the definition of a robust life -cycle management process for data that is applied consistently across Sanofi. Good overall management of data supports Sanofi's overall operations and the delivery of exponential capabilities, including artificial intelligence and machine learning to fulfil its innovation and efficiency ambitions. Failure to do so could result in business, operational and financial harm. Sanofi may fai l to accelerate its operational efficiency* As part of its strategy Sanofi has announced its intent to improve its operating efficiencies to fund growth and expand its business operating income margin. Nevertheless there is no guarantee that Sanofi will be able to fully deliver these operating efficiencies within the targeted timeline or generate the expected benefits. - 20 - Unsuccessful management of environmental, social and governance matters could adversely affect Sanofi's reputation and Sanofi may experience difficulties to meet the expectations of its stakeholders. Companies are increasingly expected to behave in a responsible manner on a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, by governmental and regulatory authorities, counterparties such as vendors and suppliers, customers, investors, the public at large and others. This context, driven in part by a rapidly changing regulatory framework in the US and in Europe , is raising new challenges and influencing strategic decisions that compan ies must take if they wish to optimize their positive impact and mitigate their negative impact on ESG matters. Sanofi has adopted an ESG strategy that aims at ensuring global access and affordability, addressing unmet needs with transformative therapies, and minimizing the impact of Sanofi's activities and products on the climate and the environment. The strategy includes leveraging its personnel's experience and making societal impact a key driver of Sanofi employees' engagement. However, despite Sanofi's strong commitment Sanofi could be unable to meet its ESG or other strategic objectives in an efficient and timely manner, or at all. Sanofi may also be unable to meet the ever more demanding criteria used by rating agencies in their ESG assessments proces s, leading to a downgrading in Sanofi's rating. Financial investments in companies which perform well in the ESG assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have made known their interest in investing in such companies. Dependin g on the ESG assessments and on the rapidly changing views on acceptable levels of action across a range of ESG topics from investors, Sanofi may be unable to meet society's or investors' expectations, its reputation may be harmed, it ma y face increased co mpliance or other costs and demand for securities issued by Sanofi and Sanofi's ability to participate in the debt and equity markets may decrease. Sanofi's success depends in part on its senior management team and other key employees and its ability to a ttract, integrate and retain key personnel and qualified individuals in the face of intense competition Sanofi's success depends on the expertise of its senior management team and other key employees. In 202 2, there were 2,3 61 \"Senior Leaders \" within Sanofi. In addition, Sanofi relies heavily on recruiting and retaining talented people to help it meet its strategic objectives. Sanofi faces intense competition for qualified individuals for senior management positions, or in speci fic geographic regions or in specialized fields such as clinical development, biosciences and devices, or digital and artificial intelligence. Sanofi's ability to hire qualified personnel also depends in part on Sanofi's ability to reward performance, incentivize its employees and to pay competitive compensation. Laws and regulations on executive compensation may restrict Sanofi's ability to attract, motivate and retain the required level of talented people. The inability to attract, integrate and/or retain high ly skille d personnel, in particular those in leadership positions, may weaken the Group's succession plans, may materially adversely affect the implementation of its strategy and its ability to meet its strategic objectives and could ultimately adversely imp act its business or results of operations. D. Environmental and safety risks of Sanofi 's industrial activities Risks from manufacturing activities and the handling of hazardous materials could adversely affect Sanofi 's results of operations and reputation * Manufacturing activities, such as the chemical manufacturing of the active ingredients in the Group's products and the relate d storage and transportation of raw materials, products and waste, expose the Group to the risks of industrial accidents that m ay lead to discharges or releases of toxic or pathogenic substances or other events that, can cause personal injury, property dam age and environmental contamination, and may result in additional operational constraints, including the shutdown of affected facilities and/or the imposition of civil, administrative, criminal penalties and/or civil damages , and affect Sanofi's reputation . The occurrence of an industrial accident may significantly reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and adversely affect Sanofi's operating results and reputation. Although Sanofi maintains property - 21 - damage, business interruption and casualty insurance that it believes is in accordance with customary industry practices, this insurance may not be adequate to fully cover all potential hazards incidental to Sanofi's business. Management of the historical contamination rel ated to Sanofi 's past industrial activities could adversely impact its results of operations and reputation The environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual and potential obligations on Sanofi to manage and/or remediate contaminated sites. The se obligations may relate to sites: that Sanofi currently owns or operates; that it formerly owned or operated; or where waste from its operations was disposed. These environmental remediation obligations could reduce Sanofi's operating results. Sanofi ac crues provisions for remediation when its management believes the need is probable and that it is reasonably possible to estimate the cost. See \"Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.10. Health, Safety and Environment \" of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F for additional information regarding its environmental policies. In particular, Sanofi's provisions for these obligations may be insufficient if the assumptions underlying these provisions prove incorrect or if Sanofi is held responsible for additional, currently undiscovered contamination. These judgments and estimates may later prove inaccurate, and any shortfalls could have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition. For more detail ed informat ion on environmental issues, see \" Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.10 Health, Safety and Environment \" and Notes B.12 and D.19.3 to the consolidated financial statements of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 - F. Sanofi is or may become involved in claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. Some current and former Sanofi subsidiaries have been named as \" potentially responsible parties \" or the equivalent under the US Comprehensive Environm ental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (also known as \" Superfund \"), and similar statutes or obligations in France, Germany, Italy, Brazil and elsewhere. As a matter of statutory or contractual obligations, Sanofi and/or its subs idiaries may retain responsibility for environmental liabilities at some of the sites of its predecessor companies, or of subsidiaries that Sanofi demerged, divested or may divest. Sanofi has disputes outstanding regarding certain sites no longer owned or operated by the Group. An adverse outcome in such disputes might have an adverse effect on its operating results. See Note D.22.d) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F and section \" Item 8. Fina ncial Information - A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information - Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings \" of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). Environmental regulations are evolving. For example, in Europe, new or evol ving regulatory regimes include the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation; the Classification and Labelling regulations applicable to hazardous chemicals; directives related to the control of major -accident hazards (the \"Seveso\" directives); the Industrial Emission regulations; the Waste Framework Directive, the Emission Trading Scheme Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Directive on Taxation of Energy Products and Electricity as well as other regulations aimed at preventing climate change. Stricter environmental, safety and health laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabili ties to the Group and could subject its handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants, site restoration and compliance to more rigorous scrutiny than is currently the case. Consequently, compliance with these laws could result in capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities, thereby adversely affecting the Group's business, results of operations or financial condition. E. Risks related to financial markets4 Counterparty risk Sanofi's financing and investing transactions, and our currency and interest rate hedges, are contracted with leading counterparties. Sanofi sets limits for investment and derivative transactions with individual financial institutions, dependi ng on the rat ing of each institution. Compliance with these limits, which are based on the notional amounts of the investments and the fair value of the hedging instruments, is monitored on a daily basis. 4 The information in this section supplement s the disclosures requ ired under IFRS 7 as presented in Note s B.8.7. to the consolidated financial statements , provided at Item 18 of the 2022 Annual Report on Form 20 -F. - 22 - The table below shows our total exposure as of 31 December 202 2 by rating and in terms of Sanofi's percentage exposure to the dominant counterparty.

(b) The notional amounts are translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate as of December 31, 2022 . As of 31 December 202 2, Sanofi held investments in euro and US dollar denominated money -market mutual funds. Those instruments have low volatility, low sensitivity to interest rate risk, and a very low probability of loss of principal. The depositary banks of the mutual funds, and of Sanofi itself, have a long -term rating of at least A. Realization of counterparty risk could impact Sanofi' s liquidity in certain circumstances. Foreign exchange risk Operating foreign exchange risk A substantial portion of Sanofi's net sales is generated in countries where the euro, which is Sanofi's reporting currency, i s not the functional currency. In 202 2, for example, 42.5% of its net sales were generated in the United States; 2 3.3% in Europe; and 3 4.2% in the Rest of the World region (as defined in the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F), including countries that are, or may in the future become, subject to exchange controls, of which 7. 3% was generated in China and 3.8% in Japan. Although Sanofi also incurs expenses in those countries, the impact of those expenses is not enough wholly to offset the impact of exchange rates on its net sales. Consequently, San ofi's operating income may be materially affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the euro and other currencies. Sanofi operates a foreign exchange risk hedging policy to reduce the exposure of operating income to exchange rate movements. That po licy involves regular assessments of Sanofi's worldwide foreign currency exposure, based on foreign currency transactions carried out by the parent company and its subsidiaries. Those transactions mainly comprise sales, purchases, research costs, co -market ing and co -promotion expenses, and royalties. To reduce the exposure of those transactions to exchange rate movements, Sanofi contracts hedges using liquid derivative instruments, mainly forward currency purchases and sales, and also foreign exchange swaps . The table below shows operating currency hedging instruments in place as of 31 December 202 2, with the notional amount translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate (see Note D.20. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 1 8 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F for the accounting classification of those instruments as of 31 December 2022). - 23 - Operating foreign exchange derivatives as of 31 December 202 2 (\u20ac million) Notional amount Fair value Forward currency sales 5,403 49 of which US dollar 2,732 56 of which Chinese yuan renminbi 576 2 of which Japanese yen 240 (5) of which Singapore dollar 180 1 of which Korean won 179 (14) Forward currency purchases 3,459 (27) of which US dollar 2,047 (21) of which Singapore dollar 375 (7) of which Chinese yuan renminbi 142 \u2014 of which Korean won 130 4 of which Taiwan dollar 84 \u2014 Total 8,862 22 The above positions mainly hedge future material foreign -currency cash flows arising after the end of the reporting period in relation to transactions carried out during the year ended 31 December 202 2 and recognized in the balance sheet at that date. Gains and losses on hedging instruments (forward contracts) are calculated and recognized in parallel with the recognition of gains and losses on the hedged items. Due to this hedging relationship, the commercial foreign exchange profit or loss on the se items (hedging instruments and hedged transactions) will be immaterial in 2022. Financial foreign exchange risk The cash pooling arrangements for foreign subsidiaries outside the euro zone, and some of Sanofi's financing activities, expo se certain Sanofi entities to financial foreign exchange risk (i.e. the risk of changes in the value of borrowings and loans denomi nated in a currency other than the functional currency of the borrower or lender). That foreign exchange exposure is hedged using derivative instruments (foreign exchange swaps, forward contracts or currency swaps) that alter the currency split of Sanofi's net debt once those instruments are taken into account. The table below shows financial currency hedging instruments in place as of 31 December 202 2, with the notional amounts translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate (see also Note D.20 . to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F for the accounting classification of these instruments as of December 31, 2022). Financial foreign exchange derivatives as of 31 December 202 2 (\u20ac million) Notional amount Fair value Expiry Forward currency sales 7,559 66 of which US dollar 6,114 (a) 59 2023 of which Pound sterling 384 7 2023 of which Chinese yuan renminbi 203 2 2023 Forward currency purchases 4,997 24 of which US dollar 2,011 (b) (c) (4) 2023 of which Singapore dollar 2,154 (d) 22 2023 of which Japanese yen 205 4 2023 Total 12,556 90 (a) Includes forward sales with a notional amount of $3,615 million expiring in 2023, designated as a hedge of Sanofi's net inves tment in Bioverativ. As of 31 December 2022, the fair value of these forward contracts represented an asset of \u20ac38 million ; the opp osite entry was recognized in \"Other comprehensive income\", with the impact on financial income and expense being immaterial. (b) Includes forward purchases with a notional amount of $ 1,000 million expiring in 2023 , designated as a fair value hedge of the exposure of $ 1,000 million of bond issues to fluctuations in the EUR/USD spot rate. As of 31 December 2022 , the fair value of the contracts was an asset of \u20ac 3 million , the opposite entry for \u20ac0.6 million of which was debited to \"Other comprehensive income\" under the cost of hedging accounting treatment. (c) Includes receiver currency swaps with a notional amount of $ 1,000 million expiring in 2023, designated as a fair value hedge of the exposure of an equivalent amount of intragroup current accounts to fluc tuations in the EUR/USD spot rate. As of 31 December 2022 , the fair value of the swaps was a liability of \u20ac 2 million , the opposite entry for \u20ac1.4 million of which was credited to \"Other comprehensive income\" under the cost of hedging accounting treatment. - 24 - (d) Includes forward purchases with a notional amount of SGD 1,500 million expiring in 2023 , designated as a fair value hedge of the exposure of an equivalent amount of intragroup current accounts to fluctuations in the EUR/SGD spot rate. As of 31 December 2022 , the fair value of the contracts was an asset of \u20ac33 million , the opposite entry for \u20ac2.5 million of which was credited to \"Other comprehensive income\" under the cost of hedging accounting. These hedging instruments generate a net financial gain or loss arising from the interest rate differential between the hedge d currency and the euro, given that the foreign exchange gain or loss on the foreign -currency borrowing and loans is offset by the change in the intrinsic value of the hedging instruments. The interest rate differential is recognized within cost of net deb t (see Note D.29. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). Sanofi may also hedge some future foreign -currency investment or divestment cash flows. Other foreign exchange risks A significant proportion of Sanofi's net assets is denominated in US dollars (see Note D.35. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). As a result, any fluctuation in the exchange rate of the US dollar against the euro automatically impacts the amount of Sanofi's equity as expressed in euros. In addition, Sanofi uses the euro as its reporting c urrency. Consequently, if one or more European Union Member States were to abandon the euro as a currency, the resulting economic upheavals - in particular, fluctuations in exchange rates - could have a significant impact on the terms under which Sanofi ca n obtain financing and on its financial results, the extent and consequences of which are not currently foreseeable. Liquidity risk Sanofi operates a centralized treasury platform whereby all surplus cash and financing needs of its subsidiaries are investe d with or funded by the parent company (where permitted by local legislation). The central treasury department manages its current and projected financing, and ensures that Sanofi is able to meet its financial commitments by maintaining sufficient cash and confirmed credit facilities for the size of its operations and the maturity of its debt (see Notes D.17.1.c and D.17.1.g to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). Sanofi diversify its short -term investments with leading counterparties using money -market products with instant access or with a maturity of less than three months. As of 31 December 202 2, cash and cash equivalents amounted to \u20ac1 2,736 million, and short -term investments predominantly comprised: - collective investments in euro and US dollar denominated money -market mutual funds. All such funds can be traded on a daily basis and the amount invested in each fund may not exceed 10% of the aggregate amount invested in such funds; - amounts inves ted directly with banks and non -financial institutions in the form of instant access deposits, term deposits, and Negotiable European Commercial Paper with a maturity of no more than three months. In addition, to optimize the liquidity/return profile of Sa nofi's short -term investments, Sanofi had \u20ac19 6 million invested in term deposits as of 31 December 202 2, expiring in June 2023 and presented within \"Other current financial assets\" (see Note D.11. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 1 8 of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). As of 31 December 202 2 Sanofi also had \u20ac8 billion of undrawn general corporate purpose confirmed credit facilities, half of which expires in December 202 3 and half in December 202 7. Those credit facilities are not subject to financial covenant ratios. Sanofi's policy is to diversify its sources of funding through public or private issuances of debt securities, in the United States (shelf registration statement) and Europe (Euro Medium Term Note program). In additio n, its A -1+/P-1 short -term rating gives Sanofi access to commercial paper programs in the United States, and to Negotiable European Commercial Paper programs in France. The average maturity of Sanofi's total debt was 4.71 years as of 31 December 202 2, compared with 5.5 years as of 31 December 31, 202 2. During 202 2, Sanofi did not draw down on its Negotiable European Commercial Paper programs in France. Average drawdowns under the US commercial paper program during 202 2 were \u20ac2. 2 billion (with a maximum of \u20ac3.8 billion); the average maturity of those drawdowns was two months. As of 31 December 202 2, neither of those programs was being utilized. In the event of a liquidity crisis, Sanofi could be exposed to difficulties in calling up our available cash, a scarcity of sources of funding including the above -mentioned programs, and/or a deterioration in their terms. This situation could damage Sanofi's capacity to refinance its debt or to issue new debt on reasonable terms. - 25 - Interest rate risk Sanofi issues debt in two currencies, the euro and the US dollar, and also invests its cash and cash equivalents in those currencies. Sanofi also operates cash pooling arrangements to manage the surplus cash and short -term liquidity needs of foreign subsid iaries located outside the euro zone. To optimize the cost of debt or reduce the volatility of debt and manage its exposure to financial foreign exchange risk, San ofi uses derivative instruments (interest rate swaps, currency swaps, foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts) that alter the fixed/floating rate split and the currency split of its net debt. The projected full -year sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations of Sanofi's debt, net of cash and cash equivalents for 202 3 is as follows: Change in short -term interest rates Impact on pre-tax net income (\u20ac million) Impact on pre-tax income/(expense) recognized directly in equity (\u20ac million) +100 bp 98 \u2014 +25 bp 25 \u2014 -25 bp (25) \u2014 -100 bp (98) \u2014 Stock market risk It is Sanofi's policy not to trade on the stock market for speculative purposes. F. Risks relating to an investment in Sanofi 's shares or ADSs Foreign exchange fluctuations may adversely affect the US dollar value of our ADSs and dividends (if any) regardless of our operating performance Holders of ADSs face exchange rate risk s. Sanofi's ADSs trade in US dollars and its shares trade in euros. The value of the ADSs and its shares could fluctuate substantially as the exchange rates between these curre ncies fluctuate. If and when Sanofi pays dividends, they would be denominated in euros. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar will affect the US dollar amounts received by owners of ADSs upon conversion by the depositary of c ash dividends, if any. Moreover, these fluctuations may affect the US dollar price of the ADSs on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) whether or not Sanofi pays dividends, in addition to any amounts that a holder would receive upon its liquidation or in the event of a sale of assets, merger, tender offer or similar transaction denominated in euros or any foreign currency other tha n US dollars. Persons holding ADSs rather than shares may have difficulty exercising certain rights as a shareholder Holders of ADSs may have more difficulty exercising their rights as a shareholder than if they directly held shares. For example, if Sanofi issues new shares and existing shareholders have the right to subscribe for a pro rata portion of the new issuance, the dep ositary is allowed, at its own discretion, to sell this right to subscribe for new shares for the benefit of the ADS holders instead of making that right available to such holders. In that case, ADS holders could be substantially diluted. Holders of ADSs m ust also instruct the depositary how to vote their shares. Because of this additional procedural step involving the depositary, the process for exercising voting rights will take longer for holders of ADSs than for holders of shares. ADS s for which the dep ositary does not receive timely voting instructions will not be voted at any meeting. US investors may have difficulty in serving process or enforcing a judgment against Sanofi or its directors or executive officers. Sales of Sanofi's shares may cause the market price of its shares or ADSs to decline. - 26 - Sales of large numbers of Sanofi's shares, or a perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price for its shares and ADSs. To Sanofi's knowledge, L'Or\u00e9al, its largest shareholder, is not subject to any contractual restrictions on the sale of the shares it holds in the Company. L'Or\u00e9al does not consider its stake in the Company as strategic. Sanofi's largest shareholder owns a significant percentage of the share capital and voting rights of Sanofi As of 31 December 202 2, L'Or\u00e9al held approximately 9.3 8% of the issued share capital, accounting for approximately 16.7 7% of the voting rights (excluding treasury shares) of Sanofi. See \" Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Pa rty Transactions - A. Major Shareholders \" of the 202 2 Annual Report on Form 20 -F (as defined below). Affiliates of L'Or\u00e9al currently serve on Sanofi's Board of Directors. To the extent L'Or\u00e9al continues to hold a large percentage of its share capital and v oting rights, it will remain in a position to exert greater influence in the appointment of the directors and officers of Sanofi and in other corporate actions that require shareholders' approval. - 27 - 2. Risk factors associated with Notes issued under the Pr ogramme Factors which the Issuer believes are specific to the Notes and material for an informed investment decision with respect to investing in the Notes issued under the Programme are described below. In each category below the Issuer sets out the materia l risks in descending order of importance, taking into account the adverse impact of such risks and the probability of their occurrence. A. Risks relating to all Series of Notes Credit risk An investment in the Notes involves a credit risk on the Issuer. Since the Notes are unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, benefiting from no direct recourse to any assets or guarantees as defined in Condition 3 (Status of the Notes ), the Noteholders can only rely on the ability of the Issuer to pay any amou nt due under the Notes. The value of the Notes will depend on the creditworthiness of the Issuer (as may be impacted by the risks related to the Issuer as described above). As of the date of this Base Prospectus, the Issuer's short -term and long -term debt are respectively rated (i) P -1 and A1, with a stable outlook, by Moody's, (ii) A -1+ and AA, with a stable outlook, by S&P and (iii) S -1+ and AA, with a stable outlook, by Scope. If the creditworthiness of the Issuer deteriorates, the potential impact on the Noteholders could be significant: a deterioratio n in creditworthiness could give rise to negative repercussions on the Noteholders because (i) the Issuer may not be able to fu lfil all or part of its payment obligations under the Notes, (ii) the value of the Notes may decrease and (iii) investors may lose all or part of their investment. French insolvency law and the EU Restructuring Directive The Issuer is a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme with its corporate seat in France. In the event that the Issuer becomes insolvent, insolvency proceedings will be generally governed by the insolvency laws of France to the extent that, where applicable, the \"centre of main interests\" (as construe d under Regulation (EU) 2015/848, as amended) of the Issuer is located in France. The Directive (EU) 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures con cerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 has been transposed into French law by the Ordonnance 2021 -1193 dated 15 September 2021. Such ordinance, applicable to proceedings opened as from 1 October 2021, amends French insolvency laws notably with regard to the process of adoption of restructuring plans under safeguard, accelerated safeguard and reorganization proceedings. According to this ordinance, \"affected parties\" (including notably creditors, and th erefore the Noteholders) may be treated in separate classes which reflect certain class formation criteria for the purpose of adopting a restructuring plan. Classes sha ll be formed in such a way that each class comprises claims or interests with rights tha t reflect a sufficient commonality of economic interest based on objective and ascertainable criteria. Noteholders will no longer deliberate on the proposed restructuring plan(s) in a separate assembly, meaning that they will no longer benefit from a speci fic veto power on the proposed plan(s). Instead, as any other affected parties, the Noteholders will be grouped into classes of affected parties (with potentially ot her creditors) and their dissenting vote may possibly be overridden through the differing v ote of the class(s) to which they belong or by a cross -class cram down sanctioned by the court. Although likely that Noteholders would be grouped within the same class for the purpose of proceedings affecting the Issuer, it cannot entirely be ruled out tha t Noteholders would be grouped into different classes based on objective and ascertainable criteria that would then prevail . The commencement of insolvency proceedings against the Issuer would have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Note s. As a consequence, any decisions taken by a class of affected parties could negatively and significantly impact the Noteholders and cause them to lose all or part of their investment, should they not be able to recover all or part of the amo unts due to t hem from the Issuer. Changes of law may occur in the future that will impact the conditions of the Notes. The Terms and Conditions of the Notes are based on and governed by the laws of France in effect as at the date of this Base Prospectus. Future judici al decision s or change s to the laws of France or administrative practice (or to the interpretation there of) after the date of this Base Prospectus may impact the Notes . Any such decision or change could be unfavourable to creditors' rights, including those of the Noteholders. If any change in law w ere unfavourable to the Issuer or the Noteholders, it could have an adverse or a significant adverse effect on the market value of the Notes (depending on the nature of the cha nge) and could have po tentially serious negative repercussions on the Noteholders' investment in the Notes. The risk of changes in law is higher for Notes with longer maturities. - 28 - Modification of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes Condition 13 ( Meetings of Holders and Waive rs) of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes contain s provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. Subject to the provisions of the Final Terms , the Noteholders will, in respect of all Tranches in any Series, be automatically grouped for the defence of their common interests in a Masse , as defined in Condition 13 ( Meetings of Holders and Waivers ). Noteholders can adopt measures either through a general meeting (the \" General Meetings \") or by consent following a written consultation (the \" Written Resolution s\"). As set out in Condition 13 (Meetings of Holders and Waivers ), the Terms and Conditions of the Notes permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant General Meeting, Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority or Noteholders who did not consent to a Written Resolution . If a decision is adopted by a majority of Noteholders through a General Meeting or by way of a Written Resolution and the related modifications were to impair or limit the rights of the Noteholders , this may have a material adverse impact on the market value of the Notes . B. Risks related to the market generally Risks related to the secondary market The Programme allows for Notes to be listed and admitted to trading on Euronext Paris . This Base Prospectus has been passported to Luxembourg under the passport ing regime of the EU Prospectus Regulation , so that the Notes may be listed or admitted to trading on the Bourse de Luxembourg . Nevertheless, the Notes may have no established trading market when issued and an active trading market for the Notes may not develop. If a market does develop, it may not be very liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable t o similar investments that have a developed secondary market. This is particularly the case for Notes that are especially sensitive to interest rate, currency or market risks, are designed for specific investment objectives or strategies or have been struct ured to meet the investment re quirements of limited categories of investors. These types of Notes generally would have a more limited secondary market and more price volatility than conventional debt securities. This may have a negative impact on the liquidity of the Notes and result i n low trading volumes. The degree of liquidity of the Notes may negatively impact the price at which an investor can dispose of the Notes where the investor is seeking to achieve a sale within a short timeframe. In su ch circumstances, the impact of this ri sk on the Noteholder would be high because Notes would likely have to be resold at a discount to the nominal value of the Notes. Furthermore, if additional and competing products are introduced in the markets, this may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. The Issuer is entitled to buy the Notes, as described in Condition 7( i), and the Issuer may issue further notes, as described in Condition 15 ( Further Issues and Consolidation ). Such transactions may adversely affect the price development of the Notes. If additional and competing products are introduced in the markets, this may adversely affect the value of the Notes. Market value of the Notes The market value of the Notes may be affected by the creditworthiness of the Issuer and a number of addi tional factors, including the value or volatility of any relevant index, including, but not limited to, market interest and yield rates and the time remaining to the maturity date. Notes may be used by market participants to constitute reference assets und er transactions which are independent from Notes issued under the Programme, for example credit default swaps or note repackagings ; the unwinding or other life cycle events of such transactions or of related collateral composed of or including Notes may, depending on the circumstances, impact the volume of the Notes then traded and in turn the market value of the Notes and/or the volatility thereof. Besides, i f the creditworthiness of the Issuer deteriorates or for whatever reason the financial condition of the Issuer deteriorates, it may not be able to fulfil all or part of its payment obligations under the Notes, and the value o f the Notes may decrease and investors may lose all or part of their investment. The value of the Notes depends on a number of in terrelated factors, including economic, financial and political events in France or elsewhere, and factors affecting capital markets in general , including Euronext Paris, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (in the event that Notes are listed on the regulated ma rket of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange by virtue of the Base Prospectus relating to such Notes having been passported to Luxembourg under the passporting regime of the EU Prospectus Regulation) , or any other stock exchanges on which the Notes may be traded in each case in accordance and in compliance with all relevant rules and regulations . The price at which a Noteholder will be able to sell the Notes prior to maturity may be at a discount, which could be substantial, from the issue price or the purchase p rice paid by such purchaser. - 29 - Exchange rate risks and exchange controls The Programme allows for Notes to be issued in a range of currencies (each a \" Specified Currency \"). The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in the Specified Currency. Th is presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities or financial statements are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the \" Investor's Currency \") other than the Specified Currency. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of the Specified Currency or revaluation of the Investor's Currency or central bank interventions in the relevant currency markets) and the risk that authorities w ith jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to the Specified Currency would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency -equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) t he Investor's Currency -equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor's Currency -equivalent market value of the Notes. Furthermore, Government and monetary or financial authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) ex change controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate . If such risk were to materialise, the Noteholders whose financial activities are carried out or dependent principally in a currency or currency unit other than the relevant Specified Currency could be very negatively impacted as they might receive less interest or principal than expected, or at worst, no interest or principal. C. Risks related to the structure and the characteristics of a particular issue of Notes The Programme allows for the issuance of a wide range of Notes with varying structures and features. Such structures and features may present particular risks for potential investors. A description of the most material risks associated with such structures and features is set out below: Interest rate risks Risks related to Fixed Rate Notes Condition 5(a) allows for the issuance of Notes that pay a fixed rate of interest to Noteholders. Investment in Fixed Rate No tes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the value of such Notes. While the nomi nal interest rate of a fixed interest rate note is fixed during the life of such a note or during a certain period of time, t he current interest rate on the capital market (market interest rate) typically changes on a daily basis. As the market interest rate changes, the price of such note changes in the opposite direction. If the market interest rate increases, the price of such n ote typically falls, until the yield of such note is approximately equal to the market interest rate. If the market interest rat e decreases, the price of a fixed rate note typically increases, until the yield of such note is approximately equal to the market interes t rate. Noteholders should be aware that movements of the market interest rate can adversely affect the price of the N otes and could cause Noteholders to lose part of the capital invested if they decide to sell Notes during a period in which the market inter est rate exceeds the fixed rate of the Notes. It is difficult to anticipate future market volatility in interest rat es, but any such volatility may have a significant adverse effect on the price of the Notes and cause Noteholders who sell Notes on the second ary market to lose part of their initial investment. Risks related to Floating Rate Notes Condition 5(b) allows for the issuance of Notes that pay a floating rate of interest to Noteholders. Investment in Notes which bear interest at a floating rate comprise (i) a reference rate and (ii) a margin to be added or subtracted, as the case may b e, from such base rate. Ty pically, the relevant margin will not change throughout the life of the Notes but there will be a periodic adjustment (as specified in the relevant Final Terms) of the reference rate (e.g., every three months or six months) which it self will change in acco rdance with general market conditions. The market value of Floating Rate Notes may be volatile if changes, particularly short -term changes, to market interest rates evidenced by the relevant reference rate can only be reflected in the interest rate of thes e Notes upon the next periodic adjustment of the relevant reference rate. It is difficult to anticipate future market volatility in interest rates, but any such volatility may negatively impact the yield of Floating Rate Notes and give rise to reinvestment risk. If the Final Terms provide for several interest payment dates, investors are exposed to the reinvestment risk if market inter est rates decline. That is, investors may reinvest the interest income paid to them only at the relevant lower interest rat es then prevailing. - 30 - Risks related to Notes which are linked to benchmarks Where , pursuant to Condition 5(b)(ii), the relevant Final Terms for a Series of Floating Rate Notes specify that the Rate of Interest for such Notes will be determined by reference to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate ( \"EURIBOR \") and other indices which are deemed to be benchmarks, investors should be aware that such benchmarks are the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Som e of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such con sequences could have a significant adverse effect on the liquidity and market value of and return on any Notes linked to such a benchmark. Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the \"Benchmarks Regulation \") was published in the European official journal on 29 June 201 6 and has been in force since 1 January 2018. The Benchmarks Regulation applies to \"contributors \", \"administrators \" and \"users \" of \"benchmarks \" (including EURIBOR) in the EU, and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised or registered (or, if non -EU- based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognised or endorsed) and to comply with extensive requirements in relation to the administration of \"benchmarks \" (or, if non -EU based, to be subject to equivalent requirements) and (ii) prevent certain uses by EU supervised entities of \"benchmarks \" of administrators that are not authorised or registered ( or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognised or endorsed). The Benchmarks Regulation could have a direct impact on any Notes linked to a \"benchmark \", including in any of the following circumstances: a rate or an index deemed to be a \"benchmark \" could not be used by a supervised entity in certain ways if its administrator does not obtain authorisation or registration or, if based in a non -EU jurisdiction, the administrator is not recognised as equivalent or recognised or endorsed and the transiti onal provisions do not apply; and the methodology or other terms of the \"benchmark \" are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherw ise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the \"benchmark \". More broadly, any of the international, national or other proposals for reform, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of \"benchmarks\", could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a \"benchmark\" and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the following effects on certain \"benchmarks\" (including EURIBOR): (i) discourage market participant s from continuing to administer or contribute to the \"benchmark\"; (ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in the \"benchmark \" or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the \"benchmark\". Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals for reform or other initiatives or investigations, could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of a nd return on any Notes linked to or referencing a \"benchmark\". The Benchmarks Regul ation was amended by Regulation (EU) 2021/168 of 10 February 2021 which introduced a harmonised approach to deal with the cessation or wind -down of certain \"benchmarks\" by conferring the power to designate a statutory replacement for certain \"benchmarks\" o n the European Commission or the relevant national authority, such replacement being limited to contracts and financial instruments. The replacement for a benchmark designated by the European Commission might thus apply to the Notes referencing a benchmark if certain conditions described in the Benchmarks Regulation as amended are satisfied. These provisions could have a negative impact on the value , the liquidity of, or the return on investment in Notes issued under the Programme with interest rate calculated by reference to the \"benchmarks\" ( including EURIBOR ) in the event that the fallback provisions in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes are deemed unsuitable (Article 23c of the Benchmark s Regulation, as amended). In addition , there are still uncertainties about the exact implementation of this provision pending the implementing regulations of the European Commission. As an example of such benchmark reforms, on 21 September 2017, the European C entral Bank announced that it would be part of a new working group tasked with the identification and adoption of a \"risk free overnight rate\" which can serve as a basis for an alternative to current benchmarks used in a variety of financial instruments an d contracts in the euro area. On 13 September 2018, the working group on Euro risk -free rates recommended the new Euro short -term rate (\" \u20acSTR \") as the new risk-free rate for the euro area. The \u20acSTR was published for the first time on 2 October 2019. Altho ugh EURIBOR has subsequently been reformed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmarks Regulation, it remains uncertain as to how long it will continue in its current form, or whether it will be further reformed. While EURIBOR continues to be publi shed - 31 - without a future cessation date, compounded \u20acSTR and forward -looking \u20acSTR term rates are being promoted for use as fallback rates in new EURIBOR transactions . Investors should be aware that, if a benchmark were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, t he rate of interest on Notes which are linked to such benchmark will be determined for the relevant period by the fall -back provisions applicable to such Notes (it being specified that if a Benchmark Event occurs , a specific fall -back shall apply - please refer to the risk factor entitled \"Occurrence of a Benchmark Event \" below). Depending on the manner in which a benchmark is to be determined under the Terms and Conditions, this may (i) if FBF Determination applies pursuant to Condition 5(b)(ii)( A), be rel ying upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the relevant benchmark which, depending on market circumstances, may not be available at the relevant time or (ii) if Screen Rate Determination applies pursuant to Condition 5(b)(ii) , result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied for the immediately preceding Interest Period for w hich the benchmark was available. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the market value or liqu idity of, and return on, any Notes linked to a \"benchmark\". The market continues to develop in relation to \u20acSTR , SOFR and SONIA as reference rate for Floating Rate Notes To avoid the problems associated with the potential manipulation and financial stabili ty risks of interbank offered rates (\"IBORs \"), regulatory authorities in a number of key jurisdictions are requiring financial markets to transition away from IBORs to near risk free rates (\" RFRs \") which exclude the element of interbank lending. RFRs may d iffer from IBORs in a number of material respects. In particular, in the majority of relevant jurisdictions, the chosen RFR is an overnight rate (f or example, the \u20acSTR in respect of the Euro, the Sterling Overnight Index Average (\" SONIA \") in respect of Sterling and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\" SOFR \") in respect of US dollars ), with the interest rate for a relevant period calculated on a backward looking basis, rather than on the basis of a forward looking term. As such, investors should be aware that RFRs may behave materially differently from EURIBOR and other IBORs as interest reference rates for the Notes. Investors should also be aware that the marke t continues to develop in relation to RFRs such as \u20acSTR , SONIA and SOFR as reference rates in the capital markets and their adoption as an alternative to LIBOR (issued pursuant to Condition s 5(b)(ii) (D)-(F)). In particular, market participants and relevant working groups are exploring alternative reference rates based on \u20acSTR , SOFR an d SONIA, including term \u20acSTR , SOFR and SONIA reference rates (which seek to measure the market's forward expectation of an average \u20acSTR , SOFR or SONIA rate over a designated term). The nascent development of these rates as an interest reference rate for the Eurobond markets, as well as continued development of \u20acSTR , SOFR and SONIA based rates for such market and the market infrastructure fo r adopting such rates, could result in reduced liquidity or increased volatility or could otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. The use of \u20acSTR, SONIA and/or SOFR and/or any other RFR as a reference rate for Eurobonds continues to develop both in terms of the substance of the calculation and in the development and adoption of market infrastructure for the issuance and trading of bonds referencing such RFRs. The market or a significant part thereof may adopt an application of \u20acSTR, SONIA and/or SOF R that differs significantly from that set out in Conditions 5(b)(ii) (D)-(F) (including in relation to fallbacks in the event that such rates are discontinued or fundamentally altered) and used in relation to Floating Rate Notes referencing any such RFR i ssued under this Programme. Since RFRs are relatively new in the market, Notes linked to such rates may have no established trading market when issued, and an established trading market may never develop or may not be very liquid. Market terms for debt sec urities linked to \u20acSTR, SONIA, SOFR and/or any other RFR, such as the spread over the relevant rate reflected in interest rate provisions, may evolve over time, and trading prices of the Notes linked to \u20acSTR, SONIA, SOFR and/or any other RFR may be lower t han those of later -issued debt securities linked to the same rate as a result. In addition, the manner of adoption or application of \u20acSTR, SOFR and SONIA reference rates in the Eurobond markets may differ materially compared with the application and adopti on of \u20acSTR, SOFR and SONIA in other markets, such as the derivatives or loan markets. Noteholders should carefully consider how any mismatch between the adoption of \u20acSTR, SOFR and SONIA reference rates across these markets may impact their net financial co st, profit or any hedging or any other financial arrangements they may put in place in connection with any acquisition, holding or disposal of Notes referencing \u20acSTR, SOFR and SONIA . Historical performance is not an indication of future performance of RFRs Hypothetical or historical performance data and trends are not indicative of, and have no bearing on, the potential performan ce of RFRs and therefore Noteholders should not rely on any such data or trends as an indicator of future perfo rmance. Daily changes in RFRs have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or market rates. As a result, the return on and value of debt securities linked to RFRs may fluctuate more than floating rate securities that are linked to less volatile rates. The future performance of any RFR is impossible to predict, and therefore no future performance of an y - 32 - RFR should be inferred from any hypothetical or historical data or trends. Calculation of interest rates based on RFRs ar e only capable of being determined at the end of the relevant Interest Period . Interest on Notes which reference \u20acSTR , SONIA or SOFR is only capable of being determined at the end of the relevant Interest Period and immediately prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date. It may be difficult investors in Notes that refe rence such rates to reliably estimate the amount of interest that w ill be payable on such Notes. The Issuer has no control over its determination, calculation or publication of \u20acSTR, SONIA or SOFR The Issuer has no control over its determination, calculation or publication of \u20acSTR , SONIA or SOFR (issued pursuant to Condit ions 5(b)(ii) (B)-(D)). There can be no guarantee that such rates will not be discontinued, suspended or fundamentally altered in a manner that is materially adverse to the interests of investors in Floating Rate Notes linked to the relevant ra te. In particular, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as administrators of \u20acSTR , SONIA and SOFR, respectively, may make methodological or other changes that could change the value of these RFRs, including changes related to the method by which such RFRs are calculated, eligibility criteria applicable to the transaction s used to calcula te such rates, or timing related to the publication of such rates. An administrator has no obligation to consider the interests of Noteholders when calculating, adjusting, converting, revising or discontinuing any such RFR. If the manner i n which \u20acSTR , SON IA or SOFR is calculated is changed, that change may result in a reduction of the amount of interest payable on such Notes and the trading prices of such Notes. In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or any successor) as administrator of SOFR may after the relevant Issue Date alter, discontinue or suspend calculation or dissemination of SOFR (in which case a Benchmark Transition Event (as defined in Condition 5(b)(ii)( E)(iv)) would occur and the fallback methods of determining the interest rate on the Notes specified in Condition 5(b)(ii)( E) would apply, potentially resulting in the determination of a Benchmark Replacement (as defined in Condition 5(b)(ii)( E)(iv)) and, if necessary, the application of the Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes (as defined in Condition 5(b)(ii)( E)(iv)). Furthermore, with respect to a Rate of Interest based on SONIA, if the Rate of Interest cannot be determined in accordance with Condition 5(b)(ii)( D), the Rate of Interest shall be (x) that determined as at the l ast preceding Interest Determination Date or (y) if there is no such preceding Interest Determination Date, the initial Rate of Interest which would have been applicab le to the Notes for the first Interest Period had the Notes been in issue for a period eq ual in duration to the scheduled first Interest Period but ending on (and excluding) the Interest Commencement Date, effectively converting such Floating Rate Notes into Fixed Rate Notes. Occurrence of a Benchmark Event Where Screen Rate Determination is used as the method to calculate the Rate of Interest in respect of Notes linked to or referencing a benchmark pursuant to Condition 5(b)(ii), certain fallback arrangements set out in Condition 5(b)(ii)( C) will apply if a Benchmark Event occurs . This includes scenarios where an inter -bank offered rate (such as EURIBOR) or other relevant reference rate, and/or any page on which such benchmark may be published, become unavailable, or if the Calculation Agent, any Paying Agent or any other party responsible for the calculation of the Rate of Interest (as specified in the relevant Final Terms) are no longer lawfully permitted to calculate interest on any such Notes under the Benchmarks Regulation or otherwise. Such fallback arra ngements include the possibility that the Rate of Interest could be set by reference to a Replacement Reference Rate (as defined in Condition 5(b)(ii)( C)), with or without the application of an adjustment spread (which, if applied, could be positive or neg ative, and would be applied with a view to reducing or eliminating, to the fullest extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as applicable) to investors arising ou t of the replacement of the relevant benchmark), and may include amendments to the Terms and Conditions of such Notes to ensure the proper operation of the successor or alternative reference rate , all as determined by the Reference Rate Determination Agent (as defined in Condition 5(b)(ii)( C)). In particular, the fallback arrangements set out in Condition 5(b)(ii)(C) apply to the Notes with a Rate of Interest based on SONIA, but not SOFR or \u20acSTR as Conditions 5(b)(ii) (E) and (F) provide specific fallback arrangements for each of SOFR and \u20acSTR , respectively. No consent of the Noteholders shall be required in connection with effecting any Replacement Reference Rate . In addition, no consent of the Noteholders shall be required in connection with any other related adjustments and/or amendments to the Terms and Conditions of such Notes which are made in order to give effect to any Replacement Reference Rate . In certain circumstances , and as specified in Condition 5(b)(ii)( C), the ultimate fallback for a particular Interest Period, including where no Replacement Reference Rate is determined, may be that the rate of interest for such Interest Period be - 33 - based on the last relevant Reference Rate available on the Relev ant Screen Page which applied for the immediately preceding Interest Period plus or minus (as indicated in the relevant Final Terms) the Margin (if any) . This ultimate fallback may result in the effective application of a fixed rate of interest to Notes li nked to or referencing a benchmark. The effective conversion into Fixed Rate Notes may affect the secondary market and the market value of such Notes as the fixed rate of interest may be lower than the rate of interest usually applicable to such Notes. In the event of the application of a fixed rate of interest, the Noteholders would not be able to benefit from any potentially favourable prevailing market conditions. It is possible that, if a Benchmark Event occurs , it will take some time before a clear successor or alternative reference rate is established in the market. Accordingly, Condition 5(b)(ii)( C) provide s as a further fallback that, following the designation of a Replacement Reference Rate, if the Reference Ra te Determination Agent determines that the Replacement Reference Rate is no longer substantially comparable to the Reference Rate or does not constitute an industry accepted successor reference rate, the Issuer shall appoint or re -appoint a Reference Rate Determination Agent (which may or may not be the same entity as the original Reference Rate Determination Agent) for the purpose of confirming the Replacement Reference Rate or determining a substitute Replacement Reference Rate in accordance with Conditi on 5(b)(ii)( C). If the Reference Rate Determination Agent is unable to or otherwise does not determine a substitute Replacement Reference Rate , then the Replacement Reference Rate will remain unchanged despite the fact that it may no longer be substantiall y comparable to the Reference Rate or that it may no longer constitute an industry accepted rate, which may have a negative effect on the market value and yield of the Notes . The Replacement Reference Rate may have no or a very limited trading history and accordingly its general evolution and/or interaction with other relevant market forces or elements may be difficult to determine or measure. In addition, given the uncertainty concerning the availability of successor or alternative reference rates and the involvement of a Reference Rate Determination Agent, the relevant fallback provisions may not operate as intended at the relevant time and the Replacement Reference Rate may perform differently from the dis continued Reference Rate . Any change or adjustment applied to any Notes linked to or referencing a benchmark may not adequately compensate for this impact . The Reference Rate Determination Agent will have discretion to adjust the Replacement Reference Rate in the circumstances described above. Any such adjustment could have unexpected consequences and could , due to the particular circumstances of each Noteholder, be unfavourable to the Noteholder s. This could in turn have quite a negative impact on the rate of interest on, and trading value of, the affected Notes. Moreover, any holders of such Notes that enter into hedging instruments based on the Relevant Rate may find their hedges to be ineffective, and they may incur costs in unwinding such hedges and rep lacing them with instruments tied to the Replacement Reference Rate . Any such consequences could have a negative effect on the liquidity and value of, and yield on, any such Floating Rate Notes or have other significant adverse effects or unforeseen consequences. Risks related to Fixed to Floating Rates Notes Condition 5(e) allows the Issuer to issue Notes with a fixed rate of interest that is later converted to a floating rate of interest and vice versa. Fixed to Floati ng Rate Notes may bear interest at a rate that the Issuer may elect to convert from a fixed rate to a floating rate. Such interest rate conversion may take place either automatically or at the option of the Issuer on the d ate specified in the relevant Fina l Terms. The Issuer's ability to convert the interest rate will affect the secondary market and the market value of the Notes since the Issuer may be expected to convert the rate when it is likely to produce a lower overall c ost of borrowing. If the Issuer converts from a fixed rate to a floating rate, the spread on the Fixed to Floating Rate Notes may be less favourable than then prevailing spreads on comparable Floating Rate Notes tied to the same reference rate. In addition, the new floating rate at any time may be lower than the rates on other Notes. It is difficult to anticipate future market volatility in interest rates, but any such volatility may have a significant adverse effect on the value of the Notes. Risks related to Zero Coupon Notes Conditio n 5 allows the Issuer to issue Zero Coupon Notes. Zero Coupon Notes are subject to higher price fluctuations than non-discounted bonds. Changes in market interest rates have a stronger impact on the prices of Zero Coupon Notes than on the prices of ordinar y Notes because the discounted issue prices are below par (if the yield is positive) . If market interest rates increase, Zero Coupon Notes can suffer higher price losses than other Notes having the same maturity and credit rating. Due to their leverage eff ect, Zero Coupon Notes are a type of investment associated with a particularly high price risk. Therefore, in similar market conditions the holders of Zero Coupon Notes could be subject to higher losses on their investments than the holders of other instru ments such as Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes. It is difficult to anticipate future market volatility in interest rates, but any such volatility may have a significant adverse effect on the value of the Notes. - 34 - Early redemption risks The Notes may be redeemed for tax reasons prior to maturity. In the event that , pursuant to Condition 8 , the Issuer would be obliged to pay additional amounts in respect of any Notes due to any withholding or deduction for or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties of whatever nature imposed or levie d, by or on behalf of the Republic of France or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, the Issuer may, and in certain circumstances shall be obliged to, redeem all outstanding Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b). In accordance with Condition 7(h), s uch ear ly redemption would be at the Early Redemption Amount, which in the case of Notes other than Zero Coupon Notes, would be their principal amount, together with any accrued interest. As a consequence of such early redemption the yields received upon redempti on may be lower than expected, and the redemption price of the Notes may be lower than the purchase price for the Notes paid by the Noteholder. As a result, part of the capital invested by the Noteholder may be lost, so that the Noteholder in such a case w ould not receive the total amount of the capital invested. In addition, investors that choose to reinvest moneys they receive through an early redemption may be able to do so only in securities with a lower yield than the redeemed Notes. Any early redemption at the option of the Issuer, if provided for in any Final Terms relating to a particular issue of Notes, could cause the yield anticipated by Noteholders to be considerably less than anticipated. The Final Terms for a particular issue of Notes m ay provide for early redemption at the option of the Issuer , pursuant to Condition 7(c) . Such right of early redemption is often provided for bonds or notes in periods of high interest rates. If the market interest rates decrease, the risk to Noteholders t hat the Issuer will exercise its right to redeem early increases. As a consequence, the yields received upon redemption may be lower than expected, and the redeemed face amount of the Notes may be lower than the purchase price for the Notes paid by the Not eholder (specified as the \" Issue Price \" in the relevant Final Terms) . As a consequence , part of the capital invested by the Noteholder may be lost, so that the Noteholder in such case would not receive the total amount of the capital invested. In addition, investors that choose to reinvest monies they receiv e through an early redemption may be able to do so only in securities with a lower yield than the redeemed Notes. The Issuer has the option, if so provided in the relevant Final Terms, to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, or in whole but not in part, as the case may be, under a call option as provided in Condition 7(c), a residual maturity call option as provided in Condition 7(d), a clean -up call option as provided in Condition 7( e) and/or, unless specified as not being applicable in the relevant Final Terms, a make -whole redemption option as provided in Condition 7( g). Such right of early redemption , if provided in the relevant Final Terms relating to a particular issue of Notes, could cause the expected yield in respect of the Notes to be considerably less than anticipated. See \" Partial redemption of Notes at the option of the Issuer or at the option of the Noteholders may make the market illiquid \" for risks relating to partial redemption. In particular, with respect to the clean -up call option in Condition 7(e) , there is no obligat ion under the Terms and Conditions of the Notes for the Issuer to inform Noteholders if and when the limit needed to exercise the clean -up call option has been reached or is about to be reached, and the Issuer 's right to redeem will exist notwithstanding t hat immediately prior to the serving of a notice in respect of the exercise of the clean -up call option, the Notes may have been trading significantly above par, thus potentially resulting in a loss of capital invested for the Noteholders . Partial redempti on of Notes at the option of the Issuer or at the option of the Noteholders may make the market illiquid. Depending on the number of Notes of the same Series in respect of which a partial redemption of the Notes at the option of the Issuer is made pursuant to Condition 7(c) or at the option of the Noteholders pursuant to Condition 7(f) , any trading market in respect of those Notes in respect of which such option is not exercised may become illiquid which, depending on the extent of the illiquidity, may negatively impact the market value of the Notes and have a direct and significant impact on any remaining Note holders seeking to dispose of their Notes. Risks relating to Notes denominated in Renminbi Restrictions on Notes denominated in Renminbi The relevant Final Terms in relation to any Series of Notes may specify that the Notes are denominated in Renminbi (\"RMB Notes \"). Renminbi is not freely convertible at present. The government of the PRC (the \"PRC Government \") continues to regulate conversion between Renminbi and other currencies. - 35 - Although the People 's Bank of China ( \"PBoC \") has implemented policies impr oving accessibility to Renminbi to settle cross - border transactions in the past, the PRC Government may not liberalise control over cross -border remittance of Renminbi in the future, that the schemes for Renminbi cross -border utilisation will not be discon tinued or that new regulations in the PRC will not be promulgated in the future which have the effect of restricting or eliminating the remittance of Renminbi into or out of the PRC. Despite the efforts in recent years to internationalise the currency, the PRC Government may impose interim or long-term restrictions on the cross -border remittance of Renminbi. In the event that funds cannot be remitted out of the PRC in Renminbi, the overall availability of Renminbi outside the PRC and the ability of the Iss uer to source Renminbi to finance its obligations under the RMB Notes may be adversely affected. As a result of the restrictions by the PRC Government on cross -border Renminbi fund flows, the availability of Renminbi outside the PRC is limited. Although t he offshore Renminbi market is expected to grow in depth and size, this is subject to constraints imposed by PRC laws and regulations on foreign exchange. New PRC law and regulations may be promulgated or the settlement arrangements between the PBoC and ce rtain financial institutions in respect of limited clearing of Renminbi outside of the PRC may be terminated or amended in the future, each of which may have the effect of restricting availability of Renminbi outside the PR C. The limited availability of Renminbi outside the PRC may affect the liquidity of its RMB Notes. To the extent the Issuer is required to source Renminbi outside the PRC to service the RMB Notes, the Issuer may not be able to source such Renminbi on satisfactory terms, if at all. Should the Issuer resort to using another currency, such as US Dollar, to respect its payme nt obligat ions under the RMB Notes, the relevant Noteholders may lose part of their investment when converting such currency back into Renminbi, depending on the prevailing exchange rate at that time . Any gain realised on the transfer of the RMB Notes by non -PRC res ident enterprise or individual Noteholders may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax or PRC individual income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC, and may materially and adversely affect the value of the Noteholder' s investment. - 36 - IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS Investors should seek financial and legal advice Prospective investors should read the detailed information set out in this Base Prospectus and should consult with their own financial and legal advisers about risks associated with investment in a particular Series of Notes and the suitability of in vestin g in the Notes in light of their particular circumstances. Credit ratings One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes or to the Issuer. A credit rating is no t a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised, suspended or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time and without notice. Any such revision , suspension or withdrawal of any such credit rating could adversely affect the value of the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impa ct of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the ratin g agency at any time. Tranches of Notes issued under the Programme may be rated or unrated. Where a Tranche of Notes is rated, such rating will not necessarily be the same as the rating(s) described above or the rating(s) assigned to Notes already issued. Where a Tranche of Notes is rated, the applicable rating(s) will be specified in the relevant Final Terms. Whether or not each credit rating applied for in relation to a relevant Tranche of Notes will be (1) issued or endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the EEA and registered under the EU CRA Regulation or by a credit rating agency which is certif ied under the EU CRA Regulation and/or (2) issued or endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the UK and registered under the UK CRA Regulation or by a credit rating agency which is certified under the UK CRA Regulation will be disclosed in the Fi nal Terms. In general, European regulated investors are restricted from using a rating for regulatory purposes if such rating is not iss ued by a credit rating agency established in the EEA and registered under the EU CRA Regulation or (1) the rating is pro vided by a credit rating agency not established in the EEA but is endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the EEA and regist ered under the EU CRA Regulation or (2) the rating is provided by a credit rating agency not established in the EEA which is certified under the EU CRA Regulation . The relevant Final Terms will specify whether or not such credit ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the European Union, and whether or not the relevant credit rating agency is registered ( or has applied for registration) under the CRA Regulation and is included in the list of registered credit rating agencies published on the website of the European Securities and Markets Authority (https://www.esma.europa.eu/credit -rating -agencies/cra -authorisation ). In general, UK regulated investors are restricted from using a rating for regulatory purposes if such rating is not issued by a credit rating agency established in the UK and registered under the UK CRA Regulation or (1) the rating is provided by a credit rating agency not established in the UK but is endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the UK and registered under the UK CRA Regulation or (2) the rating is provided by a credit rating agency not established in the UK which is certif ied under the UK CRA Regulation . Taxation Potential purchasers and sellers of the Notes should be aware that they may be required to pay taxes or other documentary charges or duties in accordance with the laws and practices of the country where the Notes are transferred or other jurisdict ions, including the relevant Issuer's jurisdictions of incorporation, which may have an impact on the income received from the Notes. In some jurisdictions, no official statements of the tax authorities or court decisions may be available for innovative finan cial instruments such as the Notes. Potential investors are advised to ask for their own tax adviser's advice on their individual taxation with respect to the acquisition, sale and redemption of the Notes. Only these advisers are in a position to duly con sider the specific situation of the potential investor. Moreover, in certain circumstances Noteholders may be subject to U.S. withholding tax. The United States has enacted rules, commonly referred to as \"FATCA \", that generally impose a new reporting and withhold ing regime with respect to certain - 37 - payments made by U.S. and non -U.S. withholding agents, particularly entities that are classified as financial institutions under FATCA. The United States has also entered into an intergovernmental agreement regarding the implementation of FATCA with France (the \" IGA\"). Sanofi does not expect payments made on or with respect to the Notes to be subject to withholding under FATCA. However, significant aspects of when and how FATCA will apply remain unclear, and no assurance can be given that withholding under FATCA will not become relevant with respect to payments made on or with respect to the Notes in the future. In the event that any withholding imposed because of FATCA, the Issuer will have no obligation to make additiona l payments in respect of such withholding.

In addition, if (i) the Floating Rate Convention is specified in the relevant Final Terms, (ii) Interest Periods are specified in accordance with Condition 5(b)(i)(B) above and (iii) any Interest Payment Date falls on the last Business Day in any month, then each subsequent Interest Payment Date shall be th e last Business Day in the month which falls the Interest Period after the preceding applicable Interest Payment Date occurred. In this Condition : \"Business Day \" means a day which is both: (A) a calendar day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange marke ts settle payments and are open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in Paris and any Business Centre specified in the relevant Final Terms; and (B) either (1) in relation to interest payable in a Specified Currency other than euro and Renminbi, a calendar day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in the principal financial centre of the country of the relevant Specified Currency (if other than Paris and any Business Centre) or (2) in relation to any sum payable in euro, a calendar day on which T2 is operating; or (3) in relation to any sum payable in Renminbi, a calendar da y on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments in Renminbi in Hong Kong and in the relevant Business Centre(s) (if any). - 49 - \"T2\" means the real -time gross settlement system operated by the Eurosystem or any successor or replacement f or that system (the \" T2 System \"). (ii) Rate of Interest The Rate of Interest payable from time to time in respect of Floating Rate Notes will be determined in the manner specified in the relevant Final Terms. (A) FBF Determination for Floating Rate Notes Where FBF Determination is specified in the relevant Final Terms as the manner in which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Accrual Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent as a rate equal to the relevant FBF Rate plus or minus (as indicated in the relevant Final Terms) the Margin (if any). For the purposes of this sub -paragraph (B), \" FBF Rate \" for an Interest Accrual Period means a rate equal to the Floating Rate that would be determined by the Calculation Agent under a Transaction under the terms of an agreement incorporating the FBF Definitions and under which: (1) the Floating Rate is as specified in the relevant Final Terms, and (2) the relevant Floating Rate Determination Date ( Date de D\u00e9termination du Taux Variable ) is the first calendar day of that Interest Accrual Period unless otherwise specified in the relevant Final Terms. For the purposes of this sub -paragraph (B), \" Floating Rate \" (Taux Variable ), \"Calculation Agent \" (Agent ), \"Floating \" (Date de D\u00e9termination du Taux Variable ) and \" Transaction \" (Transaction ) have the meanings given to those terms in the FBF Definitions, provided that Euribor means the rate calculated for deposits in euro which appears on Reuters Page EUR IBOR01, as more fully described in the relevant Final Terms. \" FBF Definitions \" means the definitions set out in the 2007 FBF Master Agreement relating to transactions on forward financial instruments as supplemented by the Technical Schedules ( Additifs Tec hniques ) as published by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Bancaire Fran\u00e7aise (together the \" FBF Master Agreement \"), unless otherwise specified in the relevant Final Terms. Investors should consult the Issuer should they require a copy of the FBF Definitions. (B) Screen Rate Determination for Floating Rate Notes i. Where \" Screen Rate Determination \" is specified in the relevant Final Terms as the manner in which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period will, subject as provided below, be (other than in respect of Notes for which SONIA, SOFR or \u20acSTR or any related index is specified as the Reference Rate in the relevant Final Terms) either: 1) the offered quotation (if there is only one quotation on the Relevant Screen Page); or 2) the arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) of the offered quotations, (expressed as a percentage rate per annum) for the Reference Rate which appears or appear, as the case may be, on the Relevant Screen Page as at 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) in the case of EURIBOR on the Interest Determination Date in question , as determined by the Fiscal Agent , plus or minus (as indicated in the relevant Final Terms) the Margin (if any). If five or more of such of fered quotations are available on the Relevant Screen Page, the highest (or, if there is more than one such highest quotation, one only of such quotations) and the lowest (or, if there is more than one such lowest quotation, one only of such quotations) sh all be - 50 - disregarded by the Fiscal Agent for the purpose of determining the arithmetic mean (rounded as provided above) of such offered quotations. For the purposes of these Conditions, \" Reference Rate \" means the rate specified as such in the relevant Final Terms. ii. If, in the case of (C)(i)(1) above, such rate does not appear on that page or, in the case of (C)(i)(2) above, fewer than two such rates appear on that page or if, in either case, the Relevant Screen Page is unavailable but a Benchmar k Event (as defined in sub -paragraph ( C) below) has not occurred, the Fiscal Agent will: 1) request the principal financial centre office of each of the Reference Banks to provide a quotation of the Reference Rate at approximately 11.00 a.m. (local time i n the principal financial centre of the Specified Currency) on the Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the Relevant Financial Centre interbank market in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time; and 2) determine the arithmetic mean of such quotations. iii. If fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested, the Fiscal Agent will determine the arithmetic mean of the rates (being the nearest to the Reference Rate, as determined by the Fiscal Agent) quoted by major banks in the principal financial centre of the Specified Currency, selected by the Fiscal Agent, at approximately 11.00 a.m. (local time in the principal financial centre of the Specified Currency) on the first calendar day of the relevant Interest Period for loans in the Specified Currency to leading European banks for a period equal to the relevant Interest Period and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time. If the Rate of Interest cannot b e determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Rate of Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the last Reference Rate available on the Relevant Screen Page, as determined by the Fiscal Agent, plus or minus (as indicat ed in the relevant Final Terms) the Margin (if any) . iv. If the Reference Rate from time to time in respect of the Floating Rate Notes is specified as being other than EURIBOR, the Rate of Interest in respect of such Notes will be determined as provided in the relevant Final Terms. v. For the purposes of this sub -paragraph (C), \" Reference Banks \" means four major banks selected by the Fiscal Agent in the market that are most closely connected with the Reference Rate, unless otherwise specified in the relevant Final Terms. (C) Benchmark Event Where Screen Rate Determination is specified in the relevant Final Terms as the manner in which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, this Condition 5(b)(ii)( C) will apply. This Condition 5(b)(ii)( C) does not apply in relation t o SOFR and \u20acSTR Reference Rates. Notwithstanding paragraphs ( B)(ii) and ( B)(iii) above and Condition 5(b)(ii)(D) (vi) and (vii) below , if the Issuer (in consultation with the Calculation Agent) determines at any time prior to any Interest Determination Date that a Benchmark Event has occurred, the Issuer will as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event before the Business Day prior to the applicable Interest Determination Date) appoint an agent , which may be a leading bank or benchmark agent in the principal financial centre of the Specified Currency (the \" Reference Rate Determination Agent \"), which will determine whether a successor or alternative reference rate, which is substantially comparable to the relevant Reference Rate and is an industry accepted successor rate, is available for the purpose of determining the Reference Rate on each Interest Determination Date falling - 51 - on or after the date of such determination (the \" Replacement Reference Rate \"). If the Reference Rate Determination Agent determines that there is a Replacement Reference Rate, the Reference Rate Determination Agent will notify the Calculation Agent of the Replacement Reference Rate to be used by the Calculation Agent to determine the Rate of Interest. If the Reference Rate Determination Agent has determined a Replacement Reference Rate, then for the purpose of determining the Reference Rate on each Interest Determination Date falling on or after such determination: i. the Reference Rate Determination Agent will also determine the changes (if any) required to the applicable Business Day Convention, the definition of Business Day, the Interest Determination Date, th e Day Count Fraction, and any method for obtaining the Replacement Reference Rate, including any adjustment needed to make such Replacement Reference Rate comparable to the relevant Reference Rate and any necessary adjustment to the spread in order to limi t any increase or decrease in the yield of the Notes resulting from the application of the Replacement Reference Rate, in each case acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner that is consistent with industry -accepted practices for such Re placement Reference Rate; ii. references to the Reference Rate in these Conditions will be deemed to be references to the relevant Replacement Reference Rate, including any alternative method for determining such rate as described in ( i) above; iii. the Referenc e Rate Determination Agent will notify the Issuer of such Replacement Reference Rate and the details described in (i) above, as soon as reasonably practicable; and iv. the Issuer will give notice to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices ) of the Replacement Reference Rate, and of the details described in (i) above as soon as reasonably practicable but in any event no later than 5:00 p.m. (London time) on the Business Day prior to the applicable Interest Determination Date. The determination of the Replacement Reference Rate and the other matters referred to above by the Reference Rate Determination Agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the Issuer, the Calculation Agent and the Noteholders, unless the Reference Rate Determination Agent determines at a later date that the Replacement Reference Rate is no longer substantially comparable to the Reference Rate or does not constitute an industry accepted successor or alternative reference rate, in which case the Issue r shall appoint or re -appoint a Reference Rate Determination Agent (which may or may not be the same entity as the original Reference Rate Determination Agent) for the purpose of confirming the Replacement Reference Rate or determining a substitute Replace ment Reference Rate in an identical manner as described above. If the Reference Rate Determination Agent is unable to or otherwise does not determine a substitute Replacement Reference Rate, then the Replacement Reference Rate will remain unchanged. If a Reference Rate Determination Agent is appointed by the Issuer and such Reference Rate Determination Agent determines that a Benchmark Event has occurred but for any reason a Replacement Reference Rate has not been determined, the Issuer may decide that no Replacement Reference Rate or any other successor or alternative reference rate will be adopted and the Reference Rate for the relevant Interest Period in such case will be equal to the last relevant Reference Rate available on the Relevant Screen Page as determined by the Calculation Agent (in consultation with the Issuer). For the purposes of these Conditions, \" Benchmark Event \" means: - 52 - (i) the relevant Reference Rate has ceased to be published on the Relevant Screen Page as a result of such benchmark ceasing to be calculated or administered; or (ii) a public statement by the administrator of the relevant Reference Rate (or by the supervisor of the administrator of such Reference Rate) that (in circumstances where no successor administrator has been or will be appointed that will continue publication of such Reference Rate), the administrator has ceased publishing such Reference Rate permanently or indefinitely or that it will cease to do so ; or (iii) a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of the relevant Reference Rate that such Reference Rate has been or will be permanently or indefinitely discontinued; or (iv) a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of the relevant Reference Rate that means that such Reference Rate will be prohibited from being used or that its use will be subject to restrictions or adverse consequences, either generally or in respect of the Notes; or (v) a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of the rel evant Reference Rate (as applicable) that, in the view of such supervisor, such Reference Rate is or will be no longer representative of its underlying market and such representativeness will not be restored (as determined by such supervisor) or the method ology to calculate such Reference Rate has materially changed ; or (vi) it has or will become unlawful for the party responsible for determining the Rate of Interest (being the Calculation Agent or such other party specified in the relevant Final Terms (such other party being (a) as at the Issue Date specified in such Final Terms, a calculation agent under at least three other then outstanding euro medium term notes issues and (b) a service provider other than the Issuer and any controlled subsidiary of the Issuer) as applicable ) to calculate any payments due to be made to any Noteholder using the relevant Reference Rate (as applicable) (including, without limitation, under the Benchmarks Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the \" Benchmarks Regulation \"), if applicable ); or (vii) that a decision to withdraw the authorisation or registration pursuant to Article 35 of the Benchmarks Regulation of any benchmark administrator previously authorised to publish the relevant Reference Rate has been adopted (for the avoidance of doubt, the authorisation or registration of the administrator of a benchmark shall not be considered to be withdrawn if the administration of such benchmark is transferred to another administrator that is so authorised or registered), provided that in the case of paragraphs (ii) to (v) above, the Benchmark Event shall occur: (A) in the case of (ii). above, on the date of the cessation of the publication of the relevant Reference Rate; (B) in the case of (iii) above, on the date as from which the releva nt Reference Rate has been or will be discontinued; (C) in the case of (iv) above, on the date as from which the relevant Reference Rate is prohibited from being used or becomes subject to restrictions or adverse consequences; or - 53 - (D) in the case of (v) above, on the date as from which the relevant Reference Rate is no longer representative of its underlying market or on which the methodology to calculate such Reference Rate has materially changed, and not (in any such case) the date of the relevant public statement (unless the date of the relevant public statement coincides with the relevant date in (A), (B), (C) or (D) above, as applicable). (D) Screen Rate Determination - SONIA: i. Where \"Screen Rate Determination - SONIA\" is specified in t he relevant Final Terms as the manner in which a Rate of Interest is to be determined, such Rate of Interest for each Interest Period will be calculated by the Calculation Agent in accordance with Condition 5(b)(ii)( D)(ii)) or 5(b)(ii)( D)(iii) subje D)(iv) to 5(b)(ii)( E)(v) as applicable . ii. Where the Calculation Method is specified in the relevant Final Terms as being \"Lag Method\", the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period will, subject as provided below, b e \"Compounded Daily SONIA -Lag\" plus or minus (as specified in the relevant Final Terms) the Margin . iii. Where the Calculation Method is specified in the relevant Final Terms as being \"Observation Shift Method\", the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period wil l, subject as provided below, be \"Compounded Daily SONIA -Shift\" plus or minus (as specified in the relevant Final Terms) the Margin . iv. For the purposes of Condition 5(b)(ii) (D)(ii): \"Compounded Daily SONIA -Lag\", with respect to an Interest Period, will be calculated by the Calculation Agent on the Interest Determination Date in accordance with the following formula, and the resulting percentage will be rounded, if necessary, to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards: [ (1+ x 365) = 11]x 365 where: \"d\" means, for any Interest Period, the number of calendar days in such Interest Period; \"do\" means, for any Interest Period, the number of London Banking Days in such Interest Period; \"i\" means, for any Interest Period, a series of whole numbers from one to d o, each representing the relevant London Banking Day in chronological order from, and including, the first London Banking Day in such Interest Period to, and including, the last London Banking Day in such Interest Period; \"Interest Determination Date \" means, in respect of any Interest Period, the date falling \"p\" London Banking Days prior to the Interest Payment Date for such Interest Period (or the date falling \"p\" London Banking Days prior to such earlier date, if any, on which the Notes are due and payable) ; \"London Banking Day \" means any day on which commercial banks are open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in London; - 54 - \"ni\" for any London Banking Day \"i\", in the relevant Interest Period the number of calendar days from, and including, such London Banking Day \"i\" up to, but excluding , the following London Banking Day (i+1); \"p\" for any Interest Period, means the number of London Banking Days specified in the relevant Final Terms which shall not be specified as less than five without the prior agreement of the Calculation Agent ; \"SONI A Reference Rate \" means, in respect of any London Banking Day, a reference rate equal to the daily Sterling Overnight Index Average (\" SONIA \") rate for such London Banking Day as provided by the administrator of SONIA to authorised distributors and as then published on the Relevant Screen Page (or if the Relevant Screen Page is unavailable, as otherwise is published by such authorised distributors) on the London Banking Day immediately following such London Banking Day; and \"SONIAi -pLBD \" means, in respect of any London Banking Day \"i\" falling in the relevant Interest Period, the SONIA Reference Rate for the London Banking Day falling \"p\" London Banking Days prior to the relevant London Banking Day \"i\". For the avoidance of doubt, the formula for the calculati on of Compounded Daily SONIA -Lag only compounds the SONIA Reference Rate in respect of any London Banking Day. The SONIA Reference Rate applied to a day that is a non -London Banking Day will be taken by applying the SONIA Reference Rate for the previous London Banking Day but without compounding. v. For the purposes of Condition 5(b)(ii) (D)(iii): \"Compounded Daily SONIA -Shift \", with respect to an Interest Period, will be calculated by the Calculation Agent on the Interest Determination Date in accordance with the following formula, and the resulting percentage will be rounded, if necessary, to the fifth decimal place, with 0.0 00005 being rounded upwards: [ (1+ x 365) = 11]x 365 where: \"d\" means, for any Observation Period, the number of calendar days in such Observation Period; \"do\" means, for any Observation Period, the number of London Banking Days in such Observation Period; \"i\" means, for any Observation Period, a series of whole numbers from one to do, each representing the relevant London Banking Day in chronological order from, and including, the first London Banking Day in such Observation Period t o, and including, the last London Banking Day in such Observation Period; \"Interest Determination Date \" means, in respect of any Interest Period, the date falling \"p\" London Banking Days prior to the Interest Payment Date for such Interest Period (or the d ate falling \"p\" London Banking Days prior to such earlier date, if any, on which the Notes are due and payable) ; \"London Banking Day \" means any day on which commercial banks are open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in London; - 55 - \"ni\" for any London Banking Day \"i\", in the relevant Observation Period the number of calendar days from, and including, such London Banking Day \"i\" up to, but excluding, the following London Banking Day (i+1); \"p\" for any Interest Period, means the number of London Banking Days specified in the relevant Final Terms ; \"Observation Period \" means, in respect of an Interest Period, the period from, and including, the date falling \"p\" London Banking Days prior to the f irst day of such Interest Period (and the first Interest Period shall begin on and include the Interest Commencement Date) and ending on, but excluding, the date which is \"p\" London Banking Days prior to the Interest Payment Date for such Interest Period ( or the date falling \"p\" London Banking Days prior to such earlier date, if any, on which the Notes become due and payable); \"SONIA Reference Rate \" means, in respect of any London Banking Day, a reference rate equal to the daily Sterling Overnight Index Ave rage (\" SONIA \") rate for such London Banking Day as provided by the administrator of SONIA to authorised distributors and as then published on the Relevant Screen Page (or if the Relevant Screen Page is unavailable, as otherwise is published by such authori sed distributors) on the London Banking Day immediately following such London Banking Day; and \"SONIAi \" means, in respect of any London Banking Day \"i\" falling in the relevant Observation Period, the SONIA Reference Rate for such day. For the avoidance of doubt, the formula for the calculation of Compounded Daily SONIA -Shift only compounds the SONIA Reference Rate in respect of any London Banking Day. The SONIA Reference Rate applied to a day that is a non -London Banking Day will be taken by applying the SO NIA Reference Rate for the previous London Banking Day but without compounding. vi. Subject to Condition 5(b)(ii)( C), if, in respect of any London Banking Day in the relevant Interest Period or Observation Period, as the case may be, the Calculation Agent determines that the SONIA Reference Rate is not available on the Relevant Screen Page or has not otherwise been published by the relevant authorised distributors, such SONIA Reference Rate in respect of the relevant London Banking Day shall be: a. (x) the Bank of England's Bank Rate (the \" Bank Rate \") prevailing at close of business on the relevant London Banking Day; plus (y) the mean of the spread of the SONIA Reference Rate to the Bank Rate over the previous p London Banking Days on which a SONIA Reference Rate has been published, excluding the highest spread (or, if there is more than one highest spread, one only of those highest spreads) and the lowest spread (or, if there is more than one lowest spread, one only of those lowest spreads) to the Bank Rate; or b. if the Bank Rate is not published by the Bank of England at close of business on the relevant London Banking Day, the SONIA Reference Rate published on the Relevant Screen Page (or otherwise published by the relevant authorised distributors) for the first pr eceding London Banking Day on which the SONIA Reference Rate was published on the Relevant Screen Page (or otherwise published by the relevant authorised distributors). vii. If the Rate of Interest cannot be determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Condition 5(b)(ii) (D), the Rate of Interest shall be (x) that - 56 - determined as at the last preceding Interest Determination Date (though substituting, where a dif ferent Margin is to be applied to the relevant Interest Period from that which applied to the last preceding Interest Period, the Margin relating to the relevant Interest Period, in place of the Margin relating to that last preceding Interest Period) or (y ) if there is no such preceding Interest Determination Date, the initial Rate of Interest which would have been applicable to the Notes for the first Interest Period had the Notes been in issue for a period equal in duration to the scheduled first Interest Period but ending on (and excluding) the Interest Commencement Date (but applying the Margin applicable to the first Interest Period . viii. If the Notes become due and payable in accordance with Condition 10 (Events of Default and Repayment Events ), the final I nterest Determination Date shall, notwithstanding the definition specified above, be deemed to be the date on which the Notes become due and payable and the Rate of Interest on the Notes shall, for so long as the Notes remain outstanding, be the rate deter mined on such date and shall continue to accrue thereon as provided in Condition 5(c) below . (E) Screen Rate Determination - SOFR i. When \"Screen Rate Determination - SOFR\" is specified in the relevant Final Terms as the manner in which a Rate of Interest is to b e determined, the Rate of Interest may be calculated using SOFR Lockout Compound, SOFR Lookback Compound or SOFR Shift Compound, as follows : a. if SOFR Lockout Compound is specified as applicable in the Final Terms, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Accr ual Period will, subject as provided below, be USD -SOFR -LOCKOUT -COMPOUND plus or minus (as indicated in the Final Terms) the Margin (if any); b. if SOFR Lookback Compound is specified as applicable in the Final Terms, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Ac crual Period will, subject as provided below be USD -SOFR -LOOKBACK -COMPOUND plus or minus (as indicated in the Final Terms) the Margin (if any); c. if SOFR Shift Compound is specified as applicable in the Final Terms, the Rate of Int erest for each Interest Acc rual Period will, subject as provided below be USD -SOFR -SHIFT -COMPOUND plus or minus (as indicated in the Final Terms) the Margin (if any); d. if SOFR Payment Delay is specified as applicable in the Final Terms, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Accrual Period will, subject as provided below be USD -SOFR -PAYMENT -DELAY plus or minus (as indicated in the Final Terms) the Margin (if any); e. if SOFR Index Compounded specified as applicable in the Final Terms, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Accrual Period will, subject as provided below be USD -SOFR -INDEX -COMPOUNDED plus or minus (as indicated in the Final Terms) the Margin (if any) . For the purpose of this Condition 5(b)(ii)( E): If the Calculation Agent (in consultation with the Issuer) determines on or prior to the relevant Reference Time that a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred with respect to the the n-current Benchmark, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to appoint an Independent Adviser, as soon as reasonable practicable, to determine the Benchmark Replacement that will replace the then -current Benchmark for all purposes relating to the N otes in - 57 - respect of all determinations on such date and for all determinations on all subsequent dates. In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Independent Adviser will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Ch anges from time to time. If a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred, any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Independent Adviser pursuant to this Condition 5(b)(ii)( E), including any det ermination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non -occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection: (i) will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error; (ii) will be made in the sole discretion of the Independent Adviser; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the documentation relating to the Notes, shall become effective without consent from the holders of the Notes or any other par ty. Notwithstanding any provision of this Condition 5(b)(ii)( E), if the Rate of Interest cannot be determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions by the Independent Adviser no SOFR Benchmark Replacement will be adopted by the Calculation Agent (or such other party responsible for the calculation of the Rate of Interest, as specified in the Final Terms (such other party being (a) as at the Issue Date specified in such Final Terms, a calculation agent under at least three other then outstanding euro medium term notes issues and (b) a service provider other than the Issuer and any controlled subsidiary of the Issuer) ) and the SOFR Benchmark Replacement will be the SOFR determined by the Calculation Agent as of the U.S. Government Securities Business Day immediately preceding the Benchmark Replacement Date. \"USD -SOFR -LOCKOUT -COMPOUND \" means the rate of return of a daily compound interest investment (with the SOFR as the reference rate for the calculation of interest) and will be calculated by the Calcula tion Agent (or such other party responsible for the calculation of the Rate of Interest, as specified in the Final Terms (such other party being (a) as at the Issue Date specified in such Final Terms, a calculation agent under at least three other then out standing euro medium term notes issues and (b) a service provider other than the Issuer and any controlled subsidiary of the Issuer) ) on the U.S. Government Securities Business Day following each SOFR Rate Cut -Off Date, as follows, with the resulting percentage being rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred -thousandth of a percentage point, 0.000005 being rounded upwards: Where: \"d\" means the number of calendar days in the relevant Interest Accrual Period;

Each Intere st Amount shall be calculated by applying the Rate of Interest to the Specified Denomination, multiplying such sum by the applicable Day Count Fraction and rounding the - 71 - resultant figure to the nearest sub -unit of the relevant Specified Currency, half of an y such sub - unit being rounded upwards or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention. \"Day Count Fraction \" means, in respect of the calculation of an amount of interest for any Interest Period: (1) if \"Actual -Actual \" or \" Actual -365 (FBF) \" is specified in the relevant Final Terms, the actual number of calendar days in the Interest Period divided by 365 (or, if any portion of that Interest Period falls in a leap year, the sum of (A) the actual number of calendar days in that portion of the Inter est Period falling in a leap year divided by 366 and (B) the actual number of calendar days in that portion of the Interest Period falling in a non - leap year divided by 365); (2) if \"Actual -365 (Fixed) \" is specified in the relevant Final Terms, the actual numb er of calendar days in the Interest Period divided by 365; (3) if \"Actual -Actual (FBF) \" is specified in the relevant Final Terms, the fraction whose numerator is the actual number of calendar days elapsed during such period and whose denominator is 365 (or 366 if 29 February falls within the Interest Period). If the Interest Period is of a duration of more than one (1) year, the basis shall be calculated as follows: (x) the number of complete years shall be counted back from the last calendar day of the Interes t Period; and (y) this number shall be increased by the fraction for the relevant period calculated as set out in the first paragraph of this definition; (4) if \"Actual -360\" is specified in the relevant Final Terms, the actual number of calendar days in the In terest Period divided by 360; (5) if \"30-360\", \"360-360\" or \" Bond Basis \" is specified in the relevant Final Terms, the number of calendar days in the Interest Period divided by 360, calculated on a formula basis as follows: Day Count Fraction = where: \"Y1\" is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first calendar day of the Interest Period falls; \"Y2\" is the year, expressed as a number, in which the calendar day immediately following the last calendar day included in the Interest Period falls; \"M1\" is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first calendar day of the Interest Period falls; \"M2\" is the calendar month, expressed as number, in which the calendar day immediately following the last calendar d ay included in the Interest Period falls; \"D1\" is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Interest Period, unless such number would be 31, in which case D 1 will be 30; and \"D2\" is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following the last calendar day included in the Interest Period, unless such number would be 31 and D 1 is greater than 29, in which case D 2 will be 30;

\"Y2\" is the year, expressed as a number, in which th e calendar day immediately following the last calendar day included in the Interest Period falls; \"M1\" is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first calendar day of the Interest Period falls; \"M2\" is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the calendar day immediately following the last calendar day included in the Interest Period falls; \"D1\" is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Interest Period, unless such number w ould be 31, in which case D 1 will be 30; and \"D2\" is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following the last calendar day included in the Interest Period, unless such number would be 31, in which case D 2 will be 30; (7) if \"30E/360 (FBF) \" is sp ecified in the relevant Final Terms, in respect of each Interest Period, the fraction whose denominator is 360 and whose numerator is the number of calendar days elapsed during such period, calculated on the basis of a year comprising 12 months of 30 days, subject to the following the exception: if the last calendar day of the Interest Period is the last calendar day of the month of February, the number of calendar days elapsed during such month shall be the actual number of days, where: D1 (dd1, mm1, yy1) is the date of the beginning of the period D2 (dd2, mm2, yy2) is the date of the end of the period the fraction is: \u00d7 [(yy2 - yy1) \u00d7 , 30)] (8) if \"30E/360 (ISDA) \" is specified in the relevant Final Terms, the number of calendar days in the Interest Period divided by 360, calculated on a formula basis as follows: Day Count Fraction = where: \"Y1\" is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first calendar day of the Interest Period falls;

\"M1\" is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first calendar day of the Interest Period falls; \"M2\" is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the calendar day immediately following the last calendar day included in the Interest Period falls; \"D1\" is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Interest Period, unless (i) that d ay is the last calendar day of February or (ii) such number would be 31, in which case D 1 will be 30; and \"D2\" is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following the last calendar day included in the Interest Period, unless (i) that day is t he last calendar day of February but not the Maturity Date (as specified in the relevant Final Terms) or (ii) such number would be 31, in which case D 2 will be 30, provided, however, that in each such case, the number of calendar days in the Interest Perio d is calculated from and including the first calendar day of the Interest Period to but excluding the last calendar day of the Interest Period. (v) Notification of Rate of Interest and Interest Amounts The Fiscal Agent will cause the Rate of Interest and each Interest Amount for each Interest Period and the relevant Interest Payment Date to be notified to the Issuer and any stock exchange on which the relevant Floating Rate Notes are for the time being listed and notice thereof to be published in accordanc e with Condition 12 ( Notices ) as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than the fourth Paris Business Day (as defined in Condition 5(b)(i)) thereafter. Each Interest Amount and Interest Payment Date so notified may subsequently b e amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of adjustment) without prior notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the Interest Period. Any such amendment will be promptly notified to the Issuer, each stock exchange on which t he relevant Floating Rate Notes are for the time being listed and to Holders of Notes in accordance with Condition 12 ( Notices ). (vi) Certificates to be Final All certificates, communications, opinions, determinations, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this Condition 5(b), whether by the Fiscal Agent or, if applicable, the Calculation Agent, shall (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith or manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Fiscal Agent, the Calculation Agent (if applicable), the other Paying Agents and all Holders of Notes and Coupons and (in the absence as aforesaid) no liability to the Issuer, the Holders of Notes and the Coupons shall attach to the Fiscal Agent or th e Calculation Agent (if applicable) in connection with the exercise or non - exercise by it of its powers, duties and discretions pursuant to such provisions. (vii) Linear Interpolation If Linear Interpolation is specified as applicable in respect of an Interest Period in the relevant Final Terms, the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be calculated by the Fiscal Agent by straight -line linear interpolation by reference to two rates which appear on the Relevant Screen Page as of 11.00 a.m. (Br ussels time) in the case of EURIBOR on the relevant Interest Determination Date, where: (A) one rate shall be determined as if the relevant Interest Period were the period of time for which rates are available next shorter than the length of the relevant I nterest Period; and (B) the other rate shall be determined as if the relevant Interest Period were the period of time for which rates are available next longer than the length of the relevant Interest Period; - 74 - provided, however, that if no rate is available for a period of time next shorter or, as the case may be, next longer than the length of the relevant Interest Period, then the Fiscal Agent shall determine such rate at such time and by reference to such sources as it determines appropriate . (c) Accrual of I nterest Each Note (or in the case of the redemption of part only of a Note that part only of such Note) will cease to bear interest (if any) from the date for its redemption unless, upon due presentation thereof, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused. In such event, interest will continue to accrue until whichever is the earlier of: (i) the date on which all amounts due in respect of such Note have been paid; and (ii) five calendar days after the date on which the full amount of the moneys payable h as been received by the Fiscal Agent and notice to that effect has been given in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices ). (d) CNY Notes Notwithstanding the foregoing, each CNY Note which is a Fixed Rate Note bears interest from (and including) the Interest Comm encement Date at the rate per annum equal to the Rate of Interest. For the purposes of calculating the amount of interest, if any Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be postponed to the next day which i s a Business Day unless it would thereby fall into the next calendar month in which case it shall be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest will be payable in arrear on each Interest Payment Date. The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11.00 a.m. (Hong Kong time) on each Interest Determination Date, calculate the amount of interest payable per Specified Denomination for the relevant Interest Period. The determination of the amount of interest payable per Specif ied Denomination by the Calculation Agent shall (in the absence of manifest error and after confirmation by the Issuer) be final and binding upon all parties. The Calculation Agent will cause the amount of interest payable per Specified Denomination for ea ch Interest Period and the relevant Interest Payment Date to be notified to each of the Paying Agents and to be notified to Noteholders as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than the fourth Business Day thereafter. The amount of interest payable per Specified Denomination and Interest Payment Date so published may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of adjustment) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the Interest Period. If the Notes become due and payable under Condition 10 ( Events of Default and Repayment Events ), the accrued interest per Specified Denomination shall nevertheless continue to be calculated as previously by the Calculation Agent in accordance with this provision but no publication of the amount of interest payable per Specified Denomination so calculated need be made. Unless otherwise agreed in the relevant Final Terms, interest shall be calculated in respect of any period by applying the Rate of In terest to the Specified Denomination, multiplying such product by the actual number of calendar days in the relevant Interest Period or, as applicable, other period concerned and dividing it by 365, and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest Renminbi sub-unit, half of any such sub -unit being rounded upwards or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention. (e) Fixed to Floating Rate Notes Each Fixed to Floating Rate Note bears interest at a rate (i) that the Issuer may decide to convert at the date specified in the relevant Final Terms from a Fixed Rate to a Floating Rate or (ii) which shall be automatically converted from a Fixed Rate to a Floating Rate at the date specified in the relevant Final Terms. 6 PAYMENTS (a) Dematerialised No tes Payments of principal and interest in respect of Dematerialised Notes shall (in the case of Dematerialised Notes in bearer dematerialised form or administered registered form) be made by transfer to the account denominated in the relevant currency of t he relevant Account Holders for the benefit of the Noteholders and, - 75 - (in the case of Dematerialised Notes in fully registered form), to an account denominated in the relevant currency with a Bank (as defined below) designated by the Noteholders. Any payment validly made to any such Account Holders, or to any such Bank (as defined below) designated by any Noteholder, will be an effective discharge of the Issuer in respect of such payment. (b) Materialised Notes Payments of principal and interest in respect of Mat erialised Notes shall, subject as mentioned below, be made against presentation and surrender during usual business hours of the relevant Materialised Notes (in the case of all other payments of principal and, in the case of interest, as specified in Condi tion 6(f)(v)) or Coupons (in the case of interest, save as specified in Condition 6(f)(v)), as the case may be, at the specified office of any Paying Agent outside the United States by a cheque payable in the relevant currency drawn on, or, at the option o f the Noteholder, by transfer to an account denominated in such currency with, a Bank (as defined below). \"Bank \" means a bank in the principal financial centre of the country for such Specified Currency or, in the case of euro, in a city in which banks hav e access to the T2 System . (c) Payments in the United States Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Materialised Notes are denominated in U.S. Dollars, payments in respect thereof may be made at the specified office of any Paying Agent in New York City in the s ame manner as aforesaid if (i) the Issuer shall have appointed Paying Agents with specified offices outside the United States with the reasonable expectation that such Paying Agents would be able to make payment of the amounts on the Notes in the manner pr ovided above when due, (ii) payment in full of such amounts at all such offices is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions on payment or receipt of such amounts and (iii) such payment is then permitted by United States law, without involving, in the opinion of the Issuer, any adverse tax consequence to the Issuer. (d) Payments subject to Fiscal Laws Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations applicable thereto in the place of pay ment, but without prejudice to the provisions of Condition 8 ( Taxation ).

(v) If the due date for redemption of any Materialised Note is not a due date for payment of interest, interest accrued from the preceding due date for payment of interest or the Interest Commencement Date, as the case may be, (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any accrued interest if applicable) shall only be payable against presentation (and surrender if appropriate) of the relevant Definitive Materialised Note. Interest accrued on a Materialised Note that only be ars interest after its Maturity Date shall be payable on redemption of such Note against presentation of the relevant Materialised Notes.

The oral presentation detailed results from the XTEND -Kids study and confirmed that ALTUVIIIO met the primary endpoint with no inhibitor development to factor VIII detec ted, and key secondary endpoints including annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and maintenance of factor VIII activity above pre -specified levels. In the pediatric population, clearance of administered factor concentrates in the blood is greater than in adults, often meaning injections are needed 2 -4 times per week using standard (SHL) or extended half -life (EHL) factor VIII products. These data confirm that a once-weekly 50 IU/kg dose of ALTUVIIIO provides highly effective bleed protection in both children and adults and can be used across clinical scenarios .
