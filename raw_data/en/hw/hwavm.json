This act held that children of enslaved blacks were to be freed by their 25th birthday. The state banned the sale of slaves four years later and required owners to register all children born into slavery; however, it was not until 1848 that the state finally outlawed the holding of all slaves. Born September 15, 1852 on the colored end of Bradley Street in New Haven, Edward Alexander Bouchet became a man of exceptional intellectual and emotional courage, undaunted by barriers of the day. His father, William Francis Bouchet, according to some, was born in Connecticut in 1817; others report that he arrived in New Haven in 1824 as the body servant to a Yale student from Charlestown, South Carolina. Edward's mother, Susan Cooley Bouchet, was born in Westport, Connecticut, October 1817, daughter of Asher and Jane Drake Cooley. Edward, the youngest of four surviving children born to William and Susan Bouchet, their only son, attended the Artisan Street Colored School, an ungraded elementary school with about 30 students and one teacher. He was enrolled in the New Haven High School for two years before entering Hopkins Grammar School (now Hopkins School) in 1868. Hopkins, a prestigious private school in New Haven, is devoted exclusively to college preparation. The course of study in this very academically oriented secondary school in the nineteenth century was three to five years based on the age and intellectual level of the student. To enter at an advanced level, Bouchet had to pass examinations in courses completed by his class. During his time at Hopkins, he studied the classics, Latin, Greek and Greek history, geometry and algebra, and graduated valedictorian in 1870.

His current book project, *Slaves of God,* explicates Augustine's reasons for justifying slavery and argues for the centrality of slavery in his ethics and politics. Olaoluwatoni is in the early stages of research on an intellectual history of penal slavery (tentatively titled *Precarious: Retributive Slavery and the Rights of Citizens*), which will trace the development of penal slavery from its ancient Roman provenances through late antique, medieval, and early modern Christian thought, and into the modern context. Other recent areas of research include: 1) the normative structure of covenants; 2) Augustine's metaphysics of goodness; 3) theism and the problem of divine domination 4) the prospects for realism about aesthetic judgments; and 5) the meaning of 'maturity' in the history of philosophy. He is currently a postdoctoral associate in Classics and Philosophy as a Klarman Fellow. Before Cornell, Olaoluwatoni earned the Ph.D. in Religion, Ethics, and Politics from Princeton University, the M.A.R. in Ethics from Yale Divinity School, and the A.B. in Religion from Princeton University.

Maurice Tetne French Language & Literature Maurice Tetne is a Ph.D. candidate in French Language and Literature at Washington University in St. Louis. His dissertation project explores regional French and its transcription into literature and cinema, focusing on a comparative study of two francophone areas: Louisiana and francophone Africa. His research examines literature and film from the nineteenth century to the present, with the aim of demonstrating how the multiethnic nature of these French-speaking regions informs the stylistic approaches adopted by authors and filmmakers in their use of the French language. Literature and cinema serve as meeting places for multiple linguistic components expressed through a domesticated French that diverges from the grammatical and semantic norms of Parisian French. Tetne has made contributions in both creative and critical writing. In June 2020, his collection of poems and short stories was published by Les \u00c9ditions Saint Honor\u00e9 in Paris. His poem Fatale dissemblance won first prize in the American Journal of French Studies[1] writing contest in 2021.

Yale University 2023 National Bouchet Graduate Honor Society Inductees Mariam Fofana Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases Mariam O. Fofana is a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases at the Yale School of Public Health and a Clinical Instructor in Emergency Medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. Her research focuses on the application of quantitative epidemiologic methods such as mathematical modeling to guide the control of infectious disease threats in under-resourced settings and marginalized populations. Her previous work includes estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions to prevent and treat HIV in South Africa and quantifying the impact of changes in tuberculosis treatment delivery on transmission. Her current work focuses primarily on immune responses, transmission dynamics and socioeconomic impact of SARS- CoV-2 in an urban informal settlement in Brazil. She is determined to make global health more equitable and sustainable through her research as well as education and advocacy efforts. Paola Figueroa-Delgado Cell Biology Paola Figueroa-Delgado is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Cell Biology at the Yale School of Medicine. Her research focuses on studying the underlying mechanisms mediating neuronal remodeling in Caenorhabditis elegans. Her thesis work will increase our understanding of fundamental processes that shape the nervous system and will provide insights into how neurodevelopmental disorders may arise. Paola is a recipient of the National Institutes of Health National Research Service Award Predoctoral Fellowship which supports her thesis work and training. In addition, she is the recipient of Yale's Annie Le Fellowship for her contributions to science and to the Yale community. Beyond her thesis work, Paola serves as the Director for the Yale Biological and Biomedical Sciences Diversity and Inclusion Collective (YBDIC), an initiative that aims to engage, empower and advance underrepresented minorities in the biological and biomedical sciences. Through YBDIC, Paola developed and launched programs that provide science education and communication opportunities to community college, undergraduate, and post-baccalaureate students. Among them: mentoring programs (matching over 70 local and national students with current Yale students); a science communication series; and, most notably, a research symposium which hosted 60 local and national students at Yale. In addition, Paola is Student Coordinator for the Yale BioMed Amgen Scholars Program, where she has mentored and supported over 40 undergraduates pursuing a Summer research experience at Yale. Her work in service to Yale and her community have awarded her the Yale-Jefferson Award for Public Service and the Vanderbilt Basic Sciences' Hispanic and Latin Heritage Graduate Leader Award.
