There are various triggers of allergies, which could be outdoor (i.e., pollen in temperate markets, temperature change in others) and indoor (i.e., dust, mold, pets).

Pain Care Pain is both a sensory and an emotional experience, felt through unconscious body functions as well as psychological and behavioral reactions. It is subjective and individual, influenced by factors such as emotions, mood, and even genetics -> Pain is personal. There are various triggers of Pain which could be environmental & lifestyle stimuli (e.g., accidents/overexertion, stress, poor posture) or physiological & medical stimuli (e.g., fever, menstruation, arthritis). Unlike other categories, nearly everyone experiences pain from time to time, 86% of consumers took action, and 50% of the time they used a medicinal or OTC type of remedy. In pain episodes like body pain or headaches, frequent sufferers are more likely to use multiple OTC products to treat their pain, which makes Pain Care one of the largest categories in Consumer Healthcare today, and the 2nd largest category for Sanofi. People experience a range of different types of pain. The most common pain types of our brands treat are: - Headache, Migraine - Back, Neck/Shoulder - Period Pain, Abdominal Pain - Toothache, Earache - Muscle, Joint, Nerve - Fever, Cold/Flu, Sore Throat Delivering for our consumers We aim to empower the people we serve to live fully, un-limited by pain, through the intersection of self-care & science. Physical & Mental Wellness Wellness is about embracing an overall healthy lifestyle... physically, mentally and spiritually. Having a sense of control empowers us to have vitality, peace of mind and be the best version of ourselves. Wellness can be like a game of \"ups and downs,\" some triggers prompt action or forward progress, while other triggers prompt reaction or backward progress, but individual scenarios are deeply personal and do not follow a prescriptive or linear path. Broad consumer trends and COVID have elevated the importance and relevance of self-care to further accelerate the shift towards Physical & Mental Wellness, which is today the #2 category in size and with fast growth in Consumer Healthcare in the last years. The category involves a series of triggers/symptoms that are interconnected and which influence one another continuously. Consumers do not always know what is triggering their issues and are not sure why symptoms are happening, the key ones with high incidence are: - Energy - Nutrition - Beauty - Guts - Mobility - Eyes - Immunity - Mood - Stress - Sleep - Focus & Memory Delivering for our consumers Access to the best solutions for body and mind self-care and education through industry leading science and human knowledge.
