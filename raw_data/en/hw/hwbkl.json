I offer a holistic approach to health and often uncover challenges and help clients identify additional goals that they never thought they needed to work on. Often these new goals become one of their biggest priorities to addressing their health concerns. I think beyond the food and help my clients with stress, sleep, grocery shopping, cooking, finding the right exercise program, lifestyle, relationships and simply how to drink more water. I offer practical tips and tricks that I've tried with myself and my family. I have a corporate/business background and have struggled with my own weight, eating habits and stress and can relate to so many people.

Stephanie is kind, open minded, articulate, creative and reasonable. After working with her one-on-one for two months I now have more energy, improved sleep and am eating three clean meals a day. Stephanie does an amazing job of recognizing the challenges many busy moms face with prioritizing their health. She developed strategies that worked for me to achieve my goals and held me accountable; I've seen such positive change in my and my family's diet that is actually sustainable. I'd recommend Stephanie to any of my friends & relatives. - Meredith - I have had the privilege of working with Stephanie 1:1 for the past 6 months and my time with her has truly been a catalyst for change in my life. I began seeing Stephanie in hopes of getting to the root cause of my inability to lose weight, my chronic fatigue and overall dissatisfaction with how I feel in my body in my early 40s with two active boys. Rather than try to treat my symptoms with just food, Stephanie took a whole mind/body approach that has helped me come to terms with the root cause issues in my life - dissatisfaction/stress with an unfulfilling career, and serious sleep issues. No amount of nutrition can overcome those factors, and Stephanie's compassionate but direct approach has helped me to take actionable steps to making many changes in my life - stress reduction, planning my exit from my job, preparing for success each day with my food choices and daily, weekly, monthly habits that can last a lifetime. I would highly recommend Stephanie to anyone looking to make transformational change in their life - it is working for me, and it will work for you!! - Michelle - Reset - 3 months A 3-month program is great for the woman who: Knows what they should be eating and likely has tried one or more diet programs but wants to make some whole sale changes for both themselves and their families. Has recently been faced (or their child) with a health issue that requires dietary changes Wants to successfully build meal planning into their life Needs inspiration and customized recipe books for her personal dietary needs and lifestyle Wants to lose a few pounds/feel better in their own skin Wants to address the underlying issue for a new health challenge or undesirable symptoms (versus finding a band-aid solution) Package includes 6, 1 hr sessions plus grocery store tour OR pantry purification visit.

Since working with Stephanie I am much more conscious of the foods that I'm buying, eating, and feeding to myself and my family. I've learned that I feel better when I limit certain foods. Stephanie is a great listener and confidant. She is able to relate to my specific situation and always has suggestions and tools on how to overcome the challenges I face as a busy working mom that I can weave into my daily life. I'd recommend Stephanie to anyone looking to make changes in her life who needs that extra boost and outlet to discuss her goals and challenges. - Kari - Clean Eating 101 Mealtime Prep and Inspiration Want to feed you (and your family) a more nourishing meal and branch out of your standard dinner rotation?
