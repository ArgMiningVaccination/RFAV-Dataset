Jordon is the best! One of the best chiropractors I've ever been to. I always feel much better after visiting him. I get a little nervous having my neck adjusted, but I trust him to do it 100%. He is not pushy and gives you some freedom to choose your treatment plan. He is also very personable and fun to talk to. The whole staff is also very friendly and I never have a problem getting an appointment. They were all so kind! I had such an amazing experience. The building is so nice and they keep it very clean. I could not have been more happy. I was nervous to go at first but they all made the experience feel so comfortable and they were all so welcoming. I went to a previous chiropractor and I love Komp so much more. Dr. Jordan is the best!! They aren't pushy at all and make appointment scheduling very easy for different schedules. I am looking so forward to my next visit! I cannot say enough positive things about Komp Chiropractic! From the second you walk in, you feel welcome and important. Not only do they treat the symptoms at hand, but they have encouraged me to stay active. I continue every 4-6 weeks for maintence visits which has only benefited my active lifestyle. Thank you for letting me live pain free. Our Doctors Originally from Salina, Kansas, Dr. Tom played football at Kansas Wesleyan University before transferring to the University of Kansas and earning a Bachelor's of Science degree in Organismal Biology. While competing at the collegiate level, Dr. Tom witnessed the incredible effects that chiropractic care can have on an injured athlete's body, and it sparked his interest in helping people heal in a fast, natural way. While earning a Doctor of Chiropractic degree at Cleveland Chiropractic College in Overland Park, Kansas, with cum laude honors, Dr. Tom learned several different techniques (Manual Adjustments, Activator, ART) to treat his patients after finding the underlying cause of injury or pain instead of just providing a \"quick fix\" for the problem. Dr. Tom is also a certified acupuncturist, having been taught by Dr. Yennie (founder of the Acupuncture Society of America) in Kansas City. Using this unique approach to his patient's health, Dr. Komp can help you recover faster, and ultimately live at your optimum health. Dr. Jordon Komp CHIROPRACTOR Born and raised in Salina, Kansas, Dr. Jordon became interested in the chiropractic profession after having several positive experiences while he was younger and active in sports that allowed him to compete free of pain. After playing baseball at Kansas Wesleyan University Dr. Jordon transferred to the University of Kansas to complete his Bachelor's of Science degree in Organismal Biology. Dr. Jordon attained a Doctor of Chiropractic degree at Cleveland Chiropractic College in Overland Park, Kansas, earning magna cum laude honors, where he learned to help patients by treating their actual cause of pain, rather than just temporarily alleviating their symptoms. Dr. Jordon is trained in several different techniques (Manual Adjustments, Activator, ART) and has studied under some of the top manual medicine practitioners in the country including Dr. Michael Leahy, developer of Active Release Techniques. Dr. Kurt Knight CHIROPRACTOR Dr. Knight earned his Doctor of Chiropractic degree from Cleveland Chiropractic College in Overland Park, Kansas graduating with cum laude honors.
