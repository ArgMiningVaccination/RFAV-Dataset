The University of Florida is a premier research institution, at tracting $494M in res earch funding for the 2004-05 fiscal year, with the Health Science Center receivi ng $257M of this funding to support research in the medical and life sciences. Technology transfer income at UF hit an all- time high at $40.3 million. Discoveries in the basic health sciences have th e potential to translate into new medical treatments. Currently, it costs nearly one billion doll ars to turn a resear ch discovery into a commercial medicine, due in large part to the expense of clinic al trials, and drug m anufacturing and testing that satisfy federal reg ulations. Of the products teste d in Phase I human c linical trials, 45% graduate to Phase II, 10% move to Phase III, and only 5% are co mmercialized. Translational research is focused on transiti oning the innovations discovered in the laboratory into the clinic, where safety and efficacy can be evaluated. The CERHB facilitat es translational research by providing expertise and infrastr ucture to investigators at the University of Florida, local start-up companies, and other universiti es, research institutions, and c ompanies in the Southeast. The CERHB is playing an integral rol e in developing the biotechnolo gy cluster in Florida by fostering new company formation, existi ng company expansion, and attracti ng outside companies to the region.
