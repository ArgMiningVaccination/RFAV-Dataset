Most notably, a West African slave known as Onesimus was responsible for introducing the concept of inoculation to the U.S. in 1716. When smallpox was ravaging the city of Boston (and the world), Onesimus shared a practice from sub-Saharan Africa that could prevent the spread of the disease. He called it \"an operation, which had given him something of the smallpox and would forever preserve him from it.\" Onesimus said, \"Whoever had the courage to use it was forever free of the fear of contagion.\" The \"operation\" to which Onesimus referred involved rubbing a little pus from an infected person into the broken skin of a healthy person. Introducing a small amount of the infection produced an immune response and effectively inoculated most participants against smallpox. While this method is considered unethical by modern standards, the practice saved hundreds of lives and laid the foundation for the smallpox vaccine that followed 100 years later.FROM THE BEGINNING1 9 SMALLPOX HISTORYAn Important Chapter In Slaveholder Cotton Mather popularizes method decreasing death rate from 1 in 7 to 1 in 40.World Health Organization declares smallpox first (and only) disease to be eradicated from the earth.Edward Jenner introduces smallpox vaccine. 6HISTORYINFORMATION SESSIONS \"WE NEED TO BRING A MESSAGE OF HOPE, BUT ALSO WE WANT TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE.

Types of vaccines How it works DNA and RNA This vaccine uses DNA or RNA molecules to teach the immune system to target key viral proteins. Easy and quick to design. Never been done before. There are no licensed DNA or RNA vaccines currently in use. None Moderna (RNA) lnovio (ONA) Pfizer (RNA)Subunit This vaccine uses a piece of a virus' surface to focus your immune system on a single target. Focuses the immune response on the most important part of the virus for protection and cannot cause infection. May not stimulate a strong response, other chemicals may need to be added to boost long-term immunity. Pertussis Hepatitis B Human papillomavirus (HPV) Novavax AdaptVacViral vector This approach takes a harmless virus and uses it to deliver viral genes to build immunity. Live viruses tend to elicit stronger immune responses than dead viruses or subunit vaccines. Important to pick a viral vector that is truly safe. An immune response to the viral vector could make the vaccine less effective. Ebola Veterinary medicine University of Oxford & AstraZeneca CanSino Biologics Johnson & Johnson\"BUILDING EQUITY IN PLANS TO DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINES INCLUDING CULTURALLY SENSITIVE, MULTI-LINGUAL OUTREACH TAILORED FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR CLOSING GAPS IN HEALTH OUTCOMES.\" The National Medical Association serves as a leading voice for quality healthcare and elimination of health disparities and established its COVID-19 Task Force on Vaccines and Therapeutics to advise NMA members, healthcare partners and patient constituents about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. The Task Force reviewed the clinical trial data in search of differences in health outcomes that would place the Black community at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes from the vaccine and determined the following: Ten percent of people who enrolled in both the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials were Black, equaling more than 4,400 and 3,000 people, respectively.Both the percentage and number of Black people enrolled are sufficient to have confidence in health outcomes of the clinical trials.Persons receiving the vaccine were > 94% less likely to develop COVID-19 infection as compared to the placebo group.Efficacy and safety were observed and consistent across age, gender, race, ethnicity and adults over 65 years of age.

The continent has been able to capitalize on knowledge from the Ebola epidemic which prepared them with improved health policies, surveillance systems, public education tactics, and the infrastructure to address COVID- 19 early on. While African nations benefit greatly from having younger populations and lower rates of obesity and diabetes (which reduce risk of severe COVID-19), their approach to mitigating COVID-19 and preparing for the vaccine are worth a salute.

Ten percent of clinical trial participants were African American.This is good because Black people are more than 2.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than White people. Q: How do the current vaccines work? A.Both recommended vaccines use mRNA technology that works by teaching the cells in the body to make a protein that triggers an immune response. It does not contain the actual virus so you cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine. Q: I heard there could be serious side effects. A: There may be temporary pain where you got the shot, fatigue, headache, chills, fever, and joint and muscle pain. This is common for most vaccines as your body builds immunity, but may last up to a week for the COVID-19 vaccines. Among tens of thousands in the study, no major side effects have been observed. In very rare cases, people have had adverse experiences or allergic reactions. You should talk with your Q: I don't want to take it because I don't trust the government. A. You have a right to feel that way. Suspicion can be an important protective measure, and it can inspire you to get the facts. The COVID-19 vaccine was developed with the same safety standards as vaccines you may already be comfortable with such as the mumps vaccine. A group of scientists developed the COVID-19 vaccine-not the government. Q: How much will the vaccine cost and where can I get it? A: The COVID-19 vaccine will be available to many people at no cost. Your doctor may apply an admin fee, but this may be covered under most insurance plans. Check your local health department to find a location to get vaccinated. Q: How can I keep my children safe? A: Vaccination is the best protection against doctor if you have a history of allergic reactions to vaccines. Also, be sure to check FDA.gov-not Twitter-about the outcomes of clinical trials.

ILACK HEALTH 6 EOUIIV \" I'm not going to be anyone's guinea pig and what about Tuskegee? Many communities of color distrust the vaccine and that can be hard to overcome. But those historical tragedies are a part of the reason that FDA regulations are so stringent now. It helps to know that people of color have given oversight to every part of the process. In fact, a Black female scientist actually co-led the development of recommended vaccines. I'll let other people take it first and see if they grow a third eye. Tens of thousands of people have taken it, and serious side effects are extremely rare. Some people experience pain where they got the shot, fever, and muscle aches which are normal immune responses. I already got COVI D, so I'm not going to worry about it. It is not yet known how long natural immunity lasts, and some have reported reinfection. If the vaccine is available to you, it will improve immunity and offer more protection. #powerandimmunity DISCUSSIONS KITCHEN TABLE TALKING POINTS The most influential voices are often those closest to ho me, gathered around the kitchen table sharing thoughts about life and current events. Our most trusted advisors are our g randmothers, our play cousins, an d people we know personally. But unless an immunopathologist lives next door, those we know personally can often be ill-informed by unreliable social media memes an d water\u00ad cooler hearsay. If you're that trusted voice for your friends and family, here are some simple responses to the tough COVID-19 vaccine conversations around the kitchen table. Why do I need two shots? The first s hot offers some degree of protection, but you gain optimal immunity 7-10 days afte r the second dose. Clinical trial data proves that it is 95% effective. My employer can't make me ge t the shot, canthey? Now that the Pfizer vaccine has FDA approval, employers can make vaccination a condition of employment. When our gra ndparents get vaccinated, can we finally visit? You can enjoy time with those who are vaccinated without fear that they will become seriously ill. But it is still possible for them to pick up the virus and pass it on to others. It is also important to remember that the current vaccines are 95% effective (not 100%). So mask-wearing and social distancing should still be a priority. My employer can't make me get the shot, can they ? Now that the Pfizer vac cine has FDA approval, employers can make vaccination a condition of employment. When I'm fully vaccinated do I still need to wear a mask ? Even if you are fully vaccinated, it is still recommended to wear a mask indoors in public when in areas of substantial or high transmission. You may choose to wear a mask regardless of the transmission level in your community, especially if you are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19. Wearing a mask is re quired on planes, buses, trains and other forms of public transportation. I'm not letting them inject me with coronavirus. Many African Americans believe they will be wrongfully injected with the virus while trying to obtain a vaccine. That is why Barack Obama said that he will get a COVID-19 vaccine publicly. He wants to show the public how much he believes in the safety of the vaccines. You cannot get COVID-19 from vaccines. Don't you think they'll make a different vaccine for Black people? This would not be in anyone's best interest. An advantage of vaccinating as many people as possible is to achieve herd immunity. This happens when the majority of the population is vaccinated and the spread of the virus is reduced. Even if every White person in the U.S. were vaccinated, herd immunity would not be achieved if Black and Brown people were not also vaccinated. So it would not be rational to distribute different, less effective vaccines. I don't take the flu shot, so why would I take this? Those who get vaccinated protect the most vulnerable among us including those who may not be able to receive vaccines. This is important for the seasonal flu, but is even more #powerandimmunity critical for COVID-19 which has taken hundreds of thousands of lives. Why aren't the vaccines FDA approved? The Pfizer vaccine is approved by the FDA and all three vaccines are recommended by the FDA. I'm ready for my freedom and getting vaccinated as soon as I can. Take time to become informed about your decision either way. After vaccination, be sure to continue mask-wearing as it is possible to spread the virus even if you won't become ill from it. I heard the vaccine causes infertility and Bell's Palsy. These are both misleading claims. It is critical to check the facts, consider real clinical trial statistics, and do a basic search for myths about vaccines. Start with CDC. gov. Be slow to share and repost information because much of what goes viral on social media is either misleading or simply false information. TAmerican Lung Associa tion. 1141 CENTEII to. ILACK HEALTH 6 EOUlfV \" #powerandimmunity\" We, as representatives of the four historically Black medical schools in our nation are committed to the inclusion of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) as we engage in research initiatives focused on the novel coronavirus, SARS CoV-2. The virus, COVID-19, disproportionately impacts the number of infections, complications, and deaths in our communities. Our research efforts will be governed by the basic principles of respect of persons, beneficence, and justice. Respect for persons demands that our communities enter into research voluntarily and with adequate information. Beneficence ensures that our communities will recognize the benefits and risks that may result from the improvement of knowledge through their participation in research. And finally, justice will be achieved by ensuring that no person is denied participation in research without good reason, nor will anyone be unduly burdened by their participation. Our decisions to recommend participation in clinical studies, including vaccine trials, will always be informed by rigorous science carried out under international rules governing the safe and ethical conduct of research. Our approach will be unbiased nor influenced by financial or non-financial conflicts.We will rely on peer-reviewed, transparent science is an important component in protecting the welfare of persons who volunteer to participate in clinical studies.
