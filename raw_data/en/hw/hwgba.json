These early reports of inoculation involved exposure to tissue diseased with smallpox (powered smallpox scabs or fluid from smallpox pustule). After Edward Jenner's report that inoculation with pus from a cowpox sore became widely accepted in the late 18th century, vaccine researchers turn to inoculants with reduced virulence. With improved understanding of the genetic makeup of pathogens and advancements in bioengineering, vaccination strategies moved away from attenuated vaccination or inactivated vaccination where an actual pathogen was used. Instead, recombinant proteins that induce an antigenic response against a pathogen without the risk of an infection developing have become focus of vaccination strategies. Some of the efforts in recombinant vaccine development have focused on the design of and evaluating the effectiveness of recombinant immune complexes (RICs) and virus-like particles (VLPs) against pathogens that currently lack an effective or efficient vaccine. Recombinant immune complexes (RICs), fundamentally, are composed of immunoglobulin molecules specific for a desired antigen that are fused to the same antigen that the antibody is specific for (Chargelegue et al., 2005). Specifically, the parts of an RIC are an antibody, linked via its C-terminus, to an antigen that is followed by an epitope tag for the antibody. This allows for the binding region of one antibody to bind to the antigen recombinantly fused to another antibody, resulting in the formation of large, highly immunogenic antibody-antigen complexes (Chargelegue et al., 2005). RICs can be engineered into 'universal vaccine platforms' through the use of antibodies specific for an epitope tag, which allows for the same antibody to be used regardless of the antigen so long as the antibody's corresponding epitope tag is expressed on the antigen (Mason et al., 2016) ( RICs take advantage of existing immunological mechanisms by utilizing antibodies' natural interaction with Fc receptors (Fridman, 1991; Van den Hoecke et al., 2017), which results in the phagocytosis and processing of the RICs and the target antigens contained within. Additionally, the increased concentration of antigens within the RIC can allow for increased B cell-receptor cross-linking, increasing B cell stimulation and activation (Avalos & Ploegh, 2014). Thus, RICs can mimic a natural immune complex and effect activation of the immune system. RICs have been evaluated as treatment platforms for diseases like Ebola fever (Phoolcharoen et al., 2011) and tuberculosis (Pepponi et al., 2014) as well as vaccine platforms for HIV (Hioe et al., 2009) and Dengue fever (Kim et al., 2015). Virus-like particles (VLPs) are non-infectious, protein-based nanoparticles derived from virus capsids that self-assemble into virus-like structures and can be modified to recombinantly express vaccine antigens, making them an adaptable vaccine platform for combatting a myriad of diseases (Rohovie et al., 2017). One of the VLP vaccines against human papillomavirus have been commercially available in the United States since the 2006 approval of Merck & Co.'s Gardasil, and more recently, potent, VLP-based vaccines have been shown significant efficacy against diseases like Zika virus (Yang et al., 2017), norovirus (Diamos & Mason, 2018), and even influenza (Pushko et al., 2017; Ramirez et al., 2018), each of which make use of the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) as the platform for their VLPs. HBcAg offers several advantages as a vaccine platform: it is both a T-cell dependent and T-cell independent antigen (Milich et al., 1986), it preferentially evokes a Th1 response instead of a Th2 response like other hepatitis B antigens (Milich et al., 1995), is a potent activator of macrophages (Cooper et al., 2005), and can be used effectively to present heterologous antigens without compromising the assembly or integrity of the HBc VLP (Sch\u00f6del et al., 1992). Delivering HBcAg the c/el loop of region also known as the 'major insertion region' (MIR), has been shown to evoke immune responses to both the HBcAg and the inserted antigen (Whitacre et al., 2009). To form VLPs, HBcAg monomers first assemble into dimers, which in turn form full VLPs when expressed in eukaryotes (Pumpens et al., 2001; Mechtcheriakova et al., 2006). This technique has been refined to allow for larger proteins to be expressed through the use of the 'tandem core' approach, which involves fusing two HBcAg reading frames together, which enables the expression of foreign antigens on both, neither, or only one of the MIRs of the HBc tandem core (Peyret et al., 2015) ( VLPs offer several advantages over more traditional vaccination approaches. To start, they can self-assemble to resemble the structure of their native virus, providing the immune system with a more authentic target and consequently improving VLPs' immunogenicity (Chackerian, 2014). Further, because they lack genomic information, they are unable to replicate, improving the safety of any VLP delivered as a vaccine. Additionally, owing to their fundamental nature of being solely a recombinant protein, they are able to be produced at much faster rates than live-attenuated and inactivated viruses, as there is no need to use production systems, like eggs, that would support virus replication. This simultaneously lowers the cost and opens the doors to a wide variety of different production methods that can be chosen based on the needs for glycosylation, folding, speed, etc. desired for any given VLP. One of hindrances of recombinant vaccines include difficulties in economically producing sufficient amounts of these recombinant proteins. One approach to answering this need is the use of plants as a production vector for recombinant vaccines (Favre, 2018). The production of valuable and viable biopharmaceuticals and vaccine antigens in plants is well-documented as being a cost-effective alternative to other means of biopharmaceutical production (Streatfield et al., 2001; Fischer & Emans, 2000; Tiwari et al., 2009; Rybicki, 2010). Plants can be grown abundantly and cheaply, providing a large source of inexpensive biomass without the need for costly bioreactors used by traditional fermentation-based systems (Chen and Davis 2016). Recent economic analyses have found substantial cost reductions for biological products made in plant-based systems compared to traditional systems (Tus\u00e9 et al. 2014; Nandi et al. 2016). Furthermore, unlike mammalian systems, plants do not harbor animal pathogens, and have limited potential for contamination with bacterial endotoxins. The use of geminiviral vectors has been demonstrated to significantly increase the yield of proteins expressed in plants systems. Geminiviral vectors allow for the insertion of desired genes into a self-replicating plant virus vector (Davies & Stanley, 1989; Stanley, 1993), which facilitates the production of vaccine antigens in plants (Chen et al., 2011). Geminiviral replication proteins amplify gene expression through the use of cellular DNA replication machinery in the nucleus, where the DNA uses soluble histones to form a 'viral minichromosome' (separate of the host genome) (Hefferon, 2014; Paprotka et al., 2015). This amplification of genes of interest is achieved through the inclusion of geminiviral replicon elements in the expression cassette. Specifically, the inclusion of the genes Rep and Rep A, as well as geminiviral short and long intergenic regions, in cis allows for the genes of interest to be amplified once delivered into the plant (Lazarowitz & Shepherd, 2008; Hefferon, 2014). Delivery of the expression cassette containing both the genes of interest and geminiviral replicon elements is enhanced through the use of the hypervirulent EHA105 strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which can be used to transfer an expression cassette flanked by the left and right border sequences of the A. tumefaciens Ti plasmid into plants. Plants are prime candidates for producing recombinant vaccines, as their glycosylation patterns can be modified to improve vaccine efficacy. For instance, some biopharmaceutical production methods inadvertently fucosylate their products, which can be counterintuitive as fucose inhibits binding of various targets by Fc gamma RIII receptors, which decreases the efficacy of antibody-based therapeutics (Shields et al., 2002). However, engineering plants to feature knocked out fucosylation pathways, as well as upregulated GnGn glycosylation (which increases binding to Fc RIIIA receptors (Maverakis et al., 2015), can increase the efficacy of plant-expressed biopharmaceuticals. Specifically, GnGn N. benthamiana plants have been engineered produce human by downregulating the endogenous f1,2-xylosylation (Xy1T) and 1,3-fucosyltransferase (FucT) genes (Strasser et al., 2008). This is key, as fucosylation inhibits FcR recognition which reduces the efficacy of immunoglobulin-based treatments (Niwa et al., 2005), and 1,2-xylosylation and core 1,3-fucose are absent from humans entirely, which could provoke unwanted immune responses against non-GnGn plant-produced therapeutics. The lack of 1,6-fucose, which is normally present in humans but not in plants, may actually be beneficial, as the lack of fucose improves antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (Shields et al., 2002), making GnGn plants the optimal production system for plant-produced biopharmaceuticals and a viable production vector for a universal influenza A vaccine.SUMMARY The disclosure relates to compositions and methods for vaccination against viruses. The vaccination compositions include a virus-like particle (VLP) and a recombinant immune complex (RIC). The methods relate to increasing the immunogenicity of virus antigens, and methods of generating an immune response in a mammalian subject, e.g., an immune response against human papillomavirus, influenza virus, and zika virus. The methods of increasing the immunogenicity of virus antigens comprise presenting virus antigens to an immune system on a VLP or a RIC. Accordingly, in some aspects, the disclosure relates to the VLPs and RICs described herein. The methods of generating an immune response in a mammalian subject against human papillomavirus, influenza virus, and zika virus comprise administering to a subject a VLP presenting an antigen from these viruses and/or at least one RIC comprising an antigen from these viruses. In some aspects, the methods of generating an immune response in a mammalian subject against human papillomavirus (HPV), influenza virus, and zika virus comprises administering to the mammalian subject a composition comprising the VLP and the RIC. In certain embodiments, the VLPs described herein comprise a first hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg) monomer, a second HBcAg monomer, and a first fragment of a virus protein, wherein the first fragment of a virus protein is linked to the major insertion region of the second HBcAg monomer. The first HBcAg and the second forms a HBcAg dimer, which forms the VLP core. In some aspects, the first fragment of the virus protein is linked between amino acid residue 77 and amino acid residue 78 of the second HBcAg monomer. In certain embodiments, the RIC comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain, an epitope tag that can bind to the immunoglobulin heavy chain, and a second fragment of a virus protein. In some aspects, the second fragment of the virus protein is linked to the C-terminus of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, which forms a C-RIC. Thus, in some embodiments, the epitope tag is linked to the C-terminus of the second fragment of the virus protein. While in other aspects, the second fragment of the virus protein is linked to the N-terminus of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, which forms a N-RIC. In such embodiments, the epitope tag is linked to the C-terminus of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. In some embodiments, the RIC further comprises an immunoglobulin light chain. In certain embodiments of the RIC, the epitope tag is an ebola antigen. In such embodiments, the epitope tag is preferably the 6D8 epitope tag and the immunoglobulin heavy chain of the RIC is preferably the immunoglobulin heavy chain of humanized 6D8 monoclonal antibody. Certain vaccination compositions are configured for vaccination against multiple subtypes of HPV, and they comprise the virus protein HPV minor capsid protein L2 (GenBank Accession No. AGH32604.1). In such compositions, the first fragment of the virus protein comprises at least 100 continuous amino acid residues from the first 200 amino acid residues from the N-terminus of HPV minor capsid protein L2. In certain embodiments, the first fragment of the virus protein comprises residues 14-122 of HPV16 minor capsid protein L2. In some aspects, the second fragment of the virus protein comprises at least 8 continuous amino acids from the first 200 amino acid residues from the N-terminus of HPV minor capsid protein L2. In certain embodiments, the second fragment of the virus protein comprises at least one peptide sequence from the HPV minor capsid protein L2 selected from the group consisting of: amino acid residues 17-36, amino acid residues 56-75, amino acid residues 65-85, and amino acid residues 96-115. In certain vaccination compositions configured for vaccination against influenza virus, the virus protein is the ectodomain of influenza matrix protein 2 and the first fragment of the virus protein and the second fragment of the virus protein comprises the amino acid sequence SLLTEVETPIRNEWGCRCNDSSD (SEQ ID NO. 9).

The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color. Copies of this patent or patent application publication with color drawing(s) will be provided by the Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee. Detailed aspects and applications of the disclosure are described below in the following drawings and detailed description of the technology. Unless specifically noted, it is intended that the words and phrases in the specification and the claims be given their plain, ordinary, and accustomed meaning to those of ordinary skill in the applicable arts. In the following description, and for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various aspects of the disclosure. It will be understood, however, by those skilled in the relevant arts, that embodiments of the technology disclosed herein may be practiced without these specific details. It should be noted that there are many different and alternative configurations, devices and technologies to which the disclosed technologies may be applied. The full scope of the technology disclosed herein is not limited to the examples that are described below. The singular forms \"a,\" \"an,\" and \"the\" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \"a step\" includes reference to one or more of such steps. As used herein, the term \"virus-like particle\" or \"VLP\" refers to multiple protein structure that mimic the organization and conformation of authentic native viruses but lack the viral genome. In some embodiments, expression of viral structural proteins, for example capsid or envelope proteins, result in the self-assembly of VLPs. In other embodiments, a viral core is required to facilitate the assembly of the VLP when fragments of a protein are the desired presentation targets at the surface of the VLP. Viral cores used in the design of VLPs include bacteriophage MS2, adeno-associated virus, adenovirus, and tobacco mosaic virus. As used herein, the term \"immune complex\" refers to a complex comprising immunoglobulin molecules or fragments thereof bound to its cognate antigen. As used herein, the term \"recombinant immune complex\" or \"MC\" refers to an immune complex that is not produced by the species that originally produces the immunoglobulin molecule in the immune complex. For example, an exemplary recombinant immune complex comprises human immunoglobulin but is synthesized by plants. Developing effective, easily modifiable vaccine platforms is an important research focus since vaccination is considered to be one of the most effective ways to provide protection against infectious diseases. Both VLPs and RICs are easily modifiable vaccine platforms once a suitable antigen for generating an immune response against an infectious agent is identified. While VLPs and RICs have been shown to have great potential as a vaccine alone, the inventors surprisingly found that co-delivering VLPs with RICs produces a greater immune response than that can be obtained through delivering either alone at the same dose of the antigen. In some aspects, combining RICs and VLPs potentiate their efficacy beyond the potential of either vaccine individually when used to vaccinate against many diseases. For example, as shown in Example 1, RICs and VLPs containing the human papillomavirus (HPV) minor capsid protein L2 (also referred to herein as \"L2\") induced higher responses when the vaccine candidates were co-delivered at the same L2 dose. In some implementations, administration of a RIC and a VLP presenting the same virus protein produces a two- to three-fold increase in the immune response generated against the virus protein (for example, measure by titer of antibody against the virus protein) when compared to administration of RIC containing the same amount the virus protein alone or administration of VLP containing the same amount of the virus protein alone (see Example 2 concerning the matrix 2 protein of influenza virus). Higher antibody titers after each combinatorial dose could result in fewer total doses needed to achieve a protective response, which could improve vaccination rates due to a lesser reliance on patient compliance to return for booster doses. Further, fewer doses of a given vaccine would also lessen the economic cost of vaccinating the population, as fewer total vaccines will be needed to achieve a sufficient level of protection. Accordingly, in certain aspects, the disclosure is directed to a universal vaccine platform comprising a VLP and at least one RIC, wherein the target antigen presented by the VLP and the target antigen in at least one RIC are from the same antigenic protein. In some aspects, the target antigen in the at least one RIC is a fragment of the target antigen in the VLP. In other aspects, the target antigen presented in the VLP and the target antigen in the RIC have the same amino acid sequence. Administration of the aforementioned vaccine composition to a mammalian subjects generates an immune response against the virus protein and thus the virus. In certain embodiments, the composition comprises the VLP and the at least one RIC at a ratio of 1:1. In some embodiments, universal vaccine platform comprises a VLP, a N-terminal RIC (or N-RIC), and a C-terminal RIC (or C-RIC). In some aspects, the target antigen in the N-RIC and the C-RIC are different portion of the same antigenic protein. In particular embodiments, compositions for generating an immune response against multiple types of HPV, multiple strains of influenza virus, and zika virus are described. In some aspects of the universal vaccine platform, the VLP and the RIC do not contain identical fragments of the virus protein. For example, the fragment of the virus protein on the VLP is a different portion of the fragment of the virus protein in the RIC. In some aspects, the fragment of the virus protein on the VLP may overlap with a portion of the fragment of the virus protein in the RIC. In other aspects, the fragment of the virus protein on the VLP do not overlap with a portion of the fragment of the virus protein in the RIC. In still other aspects, the fragment of the virus protein on the VLP may be larger than the fragment of the virus protein in the RIC and comprise the same portion of the virus protein as the fragment of the virus protein in the RIC. The flexibility of the VLP and the RIC allows for several antigens to be packaged into each platform while reaping the benefits of the vaccine synergy the platforms display. This is particularly beneficial, especially for flu vaccines, as the majority of the most promising universal influenza vaccines target more than one site on the influenza virion, for example, many recent vaccines pursue some combination of influenza virus surface proteins (Atsmon et al., 2012; Ellebedy et al., 2014; Ingle et al., 2017). Targeting multiple conserved regions of the influenza virion would aid in preventing influenza from escaping via a single mutation in one of its proteins; the fewer avenues of escape the better, especially when any of the virus' proteins could mutate. Indeed, despite its high conservation, even M2e has the potential to mutate, with the M2e of avian and swine influenza A featuring mutations at different points in the protein (Liu et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2012). While consensus sequences are useful to a point, including multiple conserved, immunogenic antigens in the design of universal influenza vaccines would make the vaccine more effective for a longer period of time. Even if the universal vaccine platform described herein is insufficient fully protect recipients after a single dose, the composition comprising the described VLP and RIC could be used as an adjuvant. For example, the composition for generating an immune response against multiple strains of influence virus could be administered as an adjuvant to existing flu vaccines to increase the efficacy of the existing vaccines from season to season. The immunogenicity of the RICs, VLPs, and the universal vaccine platform described herein can be enhanced through the use of glycoengineered plants to glycosylate the vaccines in favorable patterns (Shields et al., 2002; Maverakis et al., 2015)). Accordingly, in some aspects, the disclosure relates to methods of producing the described VLP and/or RIC in plants using a plant expression vector, for example, a geminivirus-based vector. The production of the vaccines in plants further compounds the reduction of the economic cost of the vaccine. In some implementations, the immunogenicity of the RICs, VLPs, and the universal vaccine platform described herein, even if they are produced by plant, may be further enhanced by co-administration with a vaccine adjuvant. Vaccine adjuvants commonly used with current vaccinations include, for example, alum (composed of aluminum salts), MF59 (an oil-in-water emulsion oil), AS04 Particles The VLPs described herein have a virus core formed from hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg). Upon expression, HBcAg self-aggregate to form a VLP. The target antigen for inducing a desired immune response in a subject is linked to HBcAg and is presented upon VLP formation to an organism's immune system. In preferred embodiments, the target antigen is linked to HBcAg at its major insertion region (MIR), which is located at the tip of the -helical spike. In some aspects, the target antigen is displayed on the surface of the VLP through the production of a fusion protein where the target antigen is inserted into the HBcAg protein between residues 77 and 78 of the HBcAg protein. In some aspects, the VLPs are formed from coexpression of wildtype HBcAg proteins and HBcAg with the targeted antigen linked at its MIR to create mosaics. In other aspects, the VLPS are formed with a split core, where the HBcAg protein is expressed as distinct N- and C-terminal portions, which allows assembly of structural dimers even in the absence of covalent linkage. In yet other aspects, the VLPS are formed with a tandem core where two HBcAgs are joined together by a flexible linker to give a single fused dimer protein. In such embodiments, a target antigen may be linked to the MIR of just one of the HBcAgs or both. In some aspects, different target antigens may be linked to each of the MIRs in the tandem core. In some embodiments, the VLPs described herein comprise two HBcAg monomers that are linked to form a HBcAg dimer, which self-aggregates to form the VLP ( In certain embodiments of an expression cassette encoding a VLP disclosed herein, the target antigen with flanking linker regions is inserted into the tip of the -helical spike of an HBc gene copy that is fused to another copy of HBc lacking the target antigen. In preferred embodiments, the linker regions are glycine serine linker sequences. Complexes The RICs described herein comprise an immunoglobulin heavy chain, an epitope tag that can bind to the immunoglobulin heavy chain, and a target antigen. In some aspect, the immunoglobulin heavy chain is a camelid immunoglobulin. In certain embodiments, the RIC further comprises an immunoglobulin light chain. Thus, in some aspects, the RIC comprises a standard antibody (two heavy chains and two light chains joined to form a \"Y\" shaped molecule), an antigen, and an epitope tag that is recognized by the antibody ( RICs described herein include conventional RICs where the target antigen is linked to the C-terminus of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and the epitope tag is linked to the other end of the target antigen (also referred to herein as \"C-RIC\"). The recombinant immune complex is produced by fusing a target antigen to the C-terminus of the heavy chain of an immunoglobulin that binds specifically to the antigen, wherein the co-expression of this fusion protein with the light chain of the antibody produces a fully formed immunoglobulin that is self-reactive, and results in the creation of an immune complex due to the bivalent binding capacity of the immunoglobulin. However, antigens with inaccessible N-termini cannot be easily used in the RIC platform without disrupting native antigenic conformation. Also described herein is a novel design of RIC where the target antigen is linked to the N-terminus of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and the epitope tag is linked to C-terminus of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (also referred to herein as \"N-RIC\"). In certain embodiment of an expression vector encoding RICs, the expression vector comprises a expression cassette encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain, the target antigen, and the epitope tag. In some aspects, the expression vector further comprises a second expression cassette encoding the immunoglobulin light chain. Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine Compositions In some embodiments, the disclosure relates to vaccine compositions that target multiple subtypes of HPV and methods of generating an immune response in a mammalian subject against multiple subtypes of HPV. Papillomaviruses are an ancient and diverse group of viruses, and over 200 subtypes currently known to infect humans (Doorbar et al. 2015). Diverse human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes are responsible for considerable disease burden worldwide, necessitating safe, cheap, and effective vaccines. HPV is the most common pathogen sexually transmitted disease, with more than 15 HPV oncogenic types responsible for oropharyngeal and anogenital cancers that result in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide (Crow 2012). Currently available prophylactic HPV vaccines target the L1 capsid protein, which self-assembles into highly immunogenic VLPs (Kirnbauer et al. 1992). Because neutralizing epitopes found on L1 are not broadly conserved among HPV types, multiple L1 proteins must be included in vaccine preparations to protect against multiple HPV types. The most broadly protective vaccine approved to date, Garadasil-9, provides protection against HPV types 6, 11, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58. However cross-protection with other HPV types is minimal, and the complex formulation of the vaccine makes it cost-prohibitive for much of the world (Brown et al. 2009; Wheeler et al. 2009; Mariani and Venuti 2010; al. 2015). The HPV minor capsid protein L2 is a promising candidate to create broadly protective HPV vaccines, though it is poorly immunogenic by itself. Unlike L1, neutralizing epitopes on the N-terminus of L2 are broadly conserved, and L2 antibodies can provide protection against multiple HPV subtypes (Kondo et al. 2007; Gambhira et al. 2008; Schellenbacher et al. 2017). However, as L2 is unable to form VLPs, it is poorly immunogenic by itself, necessitating strategies to enhance L2 antibody production. Accordingly, there is a need for improved HPV vaccine designs using L2. A successful vaccine based on HPV minor capsid protein L2 has yet to be confirmed. However, as shown in As referenced herein, the term \"fragments of HPV minor capsid protein L2\" refers to fragments from the highly conserved N-terminal region of the minor capsid protein L2 of human papillomaviruses. In certain embodiments, the high conserved N-terminal region of the HPV minor capsid protein L2 refers to an amino sequence corresponding to the first 200 amino acid residues of the L2 protein based on the amino acid sequence of HPV16 minor capsid protein L2, for example, residues 14-120 or residues 14-122. In some aspects, the amino acid sequence of the highly conserved N-terminal region of the L2 protein is the sequence set forth in Gene Accession CAC51368.1. As the N-terminus of the L2 protein is highly conserved across HPVs, the amino acid sequence of the highly conserved N-terminal region of the L2 protein may refer to the corresponding region in other HPVs. In some aspects, the corresponding nucleic acid sequence encoding the high conserved N-terminal region of the HPV minor capsid protein L2 is set forth in residues 1-473 of GenBank Accession No. KC330735. In other aspects, the corresponding nucleic acid sequence encoding the high conserved N-terminal region of the HPV minor capsid protein L2 may be a functionally equivalent version of nucleic acids 1-473 of GenBank Accession No. KC330735, where the translated product of the nucleic acid sequence has an amino acid sequence with at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, or at least 99% identity to the first 200 amino acid of the sequence set forth in Gene Accession CAC51368.1. The amino acid positions of HPV minor capsid protein L2 referenced herein are based on the amino acid sequence of HPV16 minor capsid protein L2 (Accession No. AGH32604.1). Due to the high level of conservation, the immune response generated from RIC and VLP targeting HPV minor capsid protein L2, even if the antigenic fragments are based on the amino acid sequence of HPV16 minor capsid protein L2 would also be an immune response that targets a variety of HPV subtypes aside from HPV16. In certain embodiments, the vaccine composition comprises a VLP assembled with a fragment of HPV minor capsid protein L2 selected from the first 200 amino acid residues from the N-terminus of HPV minor capsid protein L2 and a recombinant immune complex (RIC) comprising, as antigenic portion, an amino acid sequence of at least 8 continuous amino acids from the first 200 amino acid residues from the N-terminus of HPV minor capsid protein L2. In certain implementations of the method of generating an immune response in a mammalian subject against HPV, which are also methods of increasing the immunogenicity of HPV minor capsid protein L2, the method comprises administering to the mammalian subject a RIC comprising an HPV minor capsid protein L2 antigenic fragment, wherein the HPV minor capsid protein L2 antigenic fragment comprises an amino acid sequence of at least 8 continuous amino acids from the first 200 amino acid residues from the N-terminus of HPV minor capsid protein L2. In some implementations, the RIC is administered with a VLP displaying a fragment of HPV minor capsid protein L2. In some aspects, the VLP comprises a hepatis B virus core, for example the HBcAg protein. In certain implementations, the VLP and the RIC are administered to the mammalian subject in two vaccination events, wherein each vaccination event comprises administration of one dose of the VLP and one dose of the RIC. In some aspects, the two vaccination events are separated by a period of at least 14 day, at least 21 days, at least 28 days, at least 35 days, at least 42 days, at least 49 days, at least 56 days, about three weeks, about four weeks, about five week, about six weeks, about seven weeks, or about eight weeks. As used herein, the term \"about\" refers to \u00b13 days, \u00b12 days, or \u00b11 day. The methods of administering the VLP and RIC may be any established methods of vaccination in the prior art. In some instances, the VLP and RIC are administered subcutaneously. In some implementations, the VLP and RIC are administered with an adjuvant, for example, Imject\u00ae Alum (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.). a. Virus-Like Particle with HPV Minor Capsid Protein L2 The VLPs of the disclosure include embodiments where fragments of HPV minor capsid protein L2 displayed on the surface of viral core, for example a hepatitis B core (HBc). In some aspects, the VLPs of the disclosure also refer to fragments of HPV minor capsid protein L2 fused to fragments of HPV major capsid protein L1, which can self-assemble into a VLP. In certain embodiments, the VLPs have a core comprising the HBcAg protein and the fragment of HPV minor capsid protein L2 is displayed on the surface of HBc VLP. In some implementations, the fragment of HPV minor capsid protein L2 is displayed on the surface of HBc VLP through the production of a fusion protein where the HPV fragment is insert into the HBcAg protein between residues 77 and 78 of the HBcAg protein. In some embodiments, the fragment of HPV minor capsid protein L2 with flanking linker regions is inserted into the tip of the -helical spike of an HBc gene copy that is fused to another copy of HBc lacking the L2 insert. As the N-terminus of HPV minor capsid L2 protein is known to contain cross-neutralizing epitopes, the VLPs of the disclosure display fragments of HPV minor capsid protein L2 comprising at least 100 continuous amino acid residues from the first 200 amino acid residues from the N-terminus of the HPV minor capsid protein L2. In some implementations, the VLPs display at least 100 continuous amino acid residues from the amino acid residues 11-200 of the HPV16 minor capsid protein L2, for example, amino acid residues 11-128, amino acid residues 14-120, or amino acid residues 14-122 of HPV16 minor capsid protein L2. In certain embodiments, the fragments of HPV minor capsid protein L2 comprise about 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, or 240 amino acid residues.

In some embodiments of an expression cassette for producing the HPV VLP, the expression cassette comprises a DNA sequence encoding amino acid residues 1-149 of HBcAg, a linker (G2S)5G, amino acid residues acid capsid L2, a linker The HBc VLPs are potently immunogenic in mice, generating very consistent high antibody titers directed against HPV L2 (>1,000,000) ( b. Recombinant with HPV Capsid Protein L2 The HPV RIC comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain and a fragment of HPV minor capsid protein L2 wherein the fragment of HPV minor capsid protein L2 is genetically fused to the immunoglobulin heavy chain. In some embodiments, the HPV RIC is a C\u2014RIC or N-RIC. In some embodiments, the fragment of HPV minor capsid protein L2 is inserted into the gene encoding humanized mAb 6D8 heavy chain, resulting in 6D8 epitope-tagged fragment of HPV minor capsid protein L2. Accordingly, the RIC further comprises an ebola antigenic fragment, in particular, the GP1 protein. In one aspect, the humanized mAb 6D8 heavy chain is produced from substituting the H2 chain of mouse monoclonal antibody 6D8 with the human constant region sequences for gamma type 1 chain. In some embodiments, the antigenic fragment of HPV minor capsid protein L2 comprises an amino acid sequence of at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90, at least 100, or at least 110 continuous amino acids from the first 200 amino acid residues from the N-terminus of HPV minor capsid protein L2.

In one embodiment, the fragment of HPV minor capsid protein L2 genetically fused to an immunoglobulin has an amino acid sequence consisting of amino acid residues 14-122. The RIC is potently immunogenic in mice, generating very consistent and high antibody titers directed against HPV L2 (>1,000,000). c. Methods of Production A plant-based transient expression system based on bean yellow dwarf virus was designed to produce the VLPs and RICs of the disclosure (see example vector in Influenza Virus In some embodiments, the disclosure relates to vaccine compositions that target multiple strains of the influenza virus (also referred to herein as \"flu virus\") and methods of generating an immune response in a mammalian subject against multiple strains of the flu virus. Influenza is a deadly disease that poses a major threat to global health. Influenza is a historically and socially significant disease that is characterized by the sudden onset of a high fever, runny nose, fatigue, muscle pains, sneezing, coughing, and general malaise (World Health Organization, 2018). In a meta-analysis of six influenza seasons in the United States (from the 2010-2011 season to the 2015-2016 season), it was estimated that the number of influenza-related illnesses ranged from 9.2 million to 35.6 million per season, including 140,000 to 710,000 influenza-related hospitalizations (Rolfes et al., 2018). Further, the disease is also estimated to cost the U.S. economy anywhere from $6.3 to $25.3 billion annually (Putri et al., 2018). On a global scale, influenza-associated mortality typically ranges from 291,243 to 645,832 influenza-associated respiratory deaths per year (Iuliano et al., 2018), with most (>99%) deaths of children below the age of 5 years old occurring in developing countries. However, should a pandemic strain of influenza similar in severity to the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic occur, the cost to human life could be catastrophic, which would simultaneously cripple the global economy; the World Bank estimates that such a pandemic would cost the global economy approximately 5% of its GDP in the pandemic's first year alone (Burns et al., 2006). Due to the disease's impact around the world, there have been calls for substantial improvement in the methods used to estimate the global burden of influenza (e.g. including data on nonrespiratory complications of influenza infection, severe influenza case data, etc.) (Bresse et al., 2018), indicating that not only a potentially substantial number of cases are currently left unreported and unaccounted for within the literature, but that influenza may be a larger problem than is currently believed. While influenza vaccines lessen the annual impact of influenza on the world, it is of the utmost importance that vaccines with high rates of efficacy are developed in a timely manner. Influenza is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses, a group of single-stranded negative sense RNA viruses, and its genome is comprised of eight segments (McGeoch et al., 1976). There are four types influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D; though influenza C is not commonly associated with disease in most populations, being observed only in isolated, sporadic outbreaks in children younger than the age of six years old and elderly populations (Matsuzaki et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2016). Influenza D has been shown to only infect swine and cattle (Hause et al., 2014) (Smith et al., 2016). Influenza A and B, meanwhile, regularly circulate and cause disease in humans, with rates of influenza-related hospitalizations being higher in seasons where influenza A viruses dominate (Thompson et al., 2004). Influenza A is also more routinely the cause of epidemics and pandemics (Hay et al., 2001), as influenza A viruses have a higher mutation rate than influenza B viruses (Nobusawa & Sato, 2006) and consequently have a higher propensity to evade the protective immune response that influenza vaccines or infections confer. The high mutation rate of influenza A viruses, when compared to influenza B viruses, is partially due to influenza B viruses generally being limited to infecting humans (Hay et al., 2001). Meanwhile, influenza A viruses are able to infect a range of creatures, including, but not limited to, pigs, birds, and humans (Hay et al., 2001), increasing the likelihood of antigenic shift between human and zoonotic strains. Influenza A's association with high levels of hospitalization, seasonal epidemics, and global pandemics makes the need for a 'universal' influenza A vaccine that maintains its efficacy and protection from season to season, despite the virus' high rate of mutation, absolutely essential to preventing the influenza pandemics of the future. The surface proteins of influenza A, the type most often associated with epidemics and pandemics, mutate at a very high frequency from season to season, reducing the efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines. Over six influenza seasons in the U.S., from 2010 to 2016, it was determined that overall vaccination rates ranged from 42%-47% of the population, preventing anywhere from 1.6 million to 6.7 million illnesses, 790,000-3.1 million outpatient medical visits, 39,000-87,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000-10,000 influenza-related deaths (Rolfes et al., 2018). However, seasonal influenza vaccines are routinely associated with low rates of vaccine efficacy (VE); the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported VEs of 56% for the 2012-2013 (Jackson et al., 2013), 61% for the 2013-2014 season (Flannery et al., 2014), 23% for the 2014-2015 season (Flannery et al., 2015), 48% for the 2015-2016 season (Jackson et al., 2017), and 48% for the 2016-2017 season (Flannery et al., 2017). Furthermore, during the 2017/2018 influenza season, VE against the circulating strain of influenza A (H3N2) was estimated to be as low as 25% in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018), 17% in Canada (Skowronski et al., 2018) and 10% in Australia (Sullivan et al., 2017) despite the 2017/2018 influenza vaccine containing influenza of the same subtype and Glade. This was due, in part, to three mutations in hemagglutinin (HA), a protein on the influenza virus' surface. The vulnerability of influenza vaccines to small mutations like those observed in the 2017/2018 strain's HA protein is due primarily to the vaccines' composition, which involve including three to four strains of inactivated or attenuated influenza virus. Predictions, and subsequent recommendations, are made by the scientific community on an annual basis as to which three to four strains will most likely be in circulation during that year's influenza season. Then, vaccines composed of the predicted strains are mass-produced, traditionally in eggs, and shipped before the influenza season starts. Due to the structure and behavior of the influenza virus, traditional methods of influenza vaccine production, as well as vaccine composition, it comes as no surprise that the influenza virus is regularly able to mutate in ways that reduce the VE of a given season's influenza vaccine. The influenza A genome encodes at least ten proteins and up to 14 proteins through strain-dependent alternative splicing (Eisfeld et al., 2015; Suarez et al., 2016). The ten common influenza A proteins can be grouped into the surface proteins, which include hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and the matrix 2 protein (M2); the internal proteins, which include the nucleoprotein (NP), the matrix 1 protein (M1), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA); and the non-structural proteins 1 (NS1) and 2 (NS2) (Suarez et al., 2016). Segment 1 encodes PB2, segment 2 encodes PB1, segment 3 encodes PA, segment 4 encodes HA, segment 5 encodes NP, segment 6 encodes NA, segment 7 encodes both M1 and M2, and segment 8 encodes NS1 and NS2 (Inglis et al., 1976). HA and NA, in particular, are common targets of recombinant influenza vaccines, as HA's primary role is to facilitate viral entry into target cells through binding to sialic acid-containing receptors on the host cell (Skehel & Wiley, 2000) and NA promotes the release of newly-formed influenza virions through the removal of sialic acid residues on both the host cell and the nascent virion (Mitnaul et al., 2000). However, while the neutralization of either could provide protection against influenza A infection, HA and NA mutate frequently from season to season (Webster et al., 1982). This has led to the search for conserved, protective epitopes in not only HA (Kramer & Palese, 2019) and NA (Kosik et al., 2019), but also other influenza A proteins, so that a 'universal' influenza vaccine that is effective from season to season can be developed. Certain regions of these proteins are conserved between strains of influenza A, making them attractive targets for the development of a 'universal' influenza vaccine. One of these regions can be found on influenza matrix 2 protein M2, which is a tetrameric integral membrane protein that, despite being found at low levels on influenza A virion, facilitates viral uncoating in its role as a proton channel (Lamb et al., 1985). The ectodomain of the influenza matrix 2 protein (M2e) has not changed significantly since it was first identified in 1933 (Fiers et al., 2004). This highly-conserved region of M2 is poorly immunogenic on its own, but when conjugated or fused to potent adjuvants or carriers, it becomes a potent target against influenza A (Mardanova & Ravin, 2018). M2 is expressed on the surface of infected cells at nearly the same rate as NA, but is incorporated into virions much less than NA, with only 14 to 68 molecules of M2 per virion versus 198-211 molecules of NA, suggesting that M2 is selectively excluded from forming virions (Lamb et al., 1985; Zebedee et al., 1988). Despite this, vaccines targeting M2e have demonstrated protection in several studies, with this protection having been determined to be due not to the prevention of infection, but instead through Fc-receptor dependent cells (El Bakkouri et al., 2011). Additionally, it has been discovered that lung-resident Th17 CD4 T cells specific for M2e tetramers are broadly effective against influenza infection, indicating that the anti-M2e response is not limited only to antibody-dependent responses (Eliasson et al., 2018). In clinical trials, vaccines targeting M2e have been well-tolerated, with studies investigating M2e expressed recombinantly on hepatitis B core antigen (HBc) (Fiers et al., 2009), even in the presence of anti-HBc antibodies, and fused to flagellin (Turley et al., 2011) demonstrating safety and efficacy. Several other clinical trials have been conducted around the world investigating M2e's potential as a vaccine antigen (Scorza et al., 2016) to varying degrees of success. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have attempted to express M2e recombinantly in a recombinant immune complex (RIC), a promising 'universal vaccine platform' that could boost the immunogenicity of M2e substantially and whose modularity could allow for the addition of other prominent and conserved influenza targets and adjuvants to adjust to whatever potential hurdles the influenza epidemics and pandemics of the future may have to offer. In certain implementations of the method of generating an immune response in a mammalian subject against influenza virus, which are also methods of increasing the immunogenicity of M2e protein of influenza A virus, the method comprises administering to the mammalian subject a VLP presenting M2e. In some implementations, a RIC comprising M2e is also administered. In some aspects, RIC comprising M2e and VLP presenting M2e are co-administered. In some aspects, the RIC and the VLP are coadministered in a ratio of 1:1. In certain implementations, the VLP and the RIC are administered to the mammalian subject in three vaccination events, wherein each vaccination event comprises administration of one dose of the VLP and/or one dose of the RIC. In some aspects, two vaccination events are separated by a period of at least 14 day, at least 21 days, at least 28 days, at least 35 days, at least 42 days, at least 49 days, at least 56 days, about three weeks, about four weeks, about five week, about six weeks, about seven weeks, or about eight weeks. As used herein, the term \"about\" refers to \u00b13 days, \u00b12 days, or \u00b11 day. The methods of administering the VLP and MC may be any established methods of vaccination in the prior art. In some instances, the VLP and RIC are administered subcutaneously. In some implementations, the VLP and RIC are administered with an adjuvant. As shown in Example 2 section d, recipients of the VLP+RIC exhibited endpoint anti-M2e antibody titers that were 2 to 3 times higher than mice that received the VLP alone. While IgG2a:IgG1 ratios were higher in mice vaccinated solely with the VLP, the higher overall titers are encouraging and demonstrate a degree of interaction between the RIC and VLP vaccines. Thus, the VLP presenting M2e and RICs comprising M2e are promising new universal influenza A vaccines. Additionally, co-delivering different types of recombinant vaccines could reduce the total number of vaccine doses needed to achieve a protective immune response. a. Virus-Like Particle with M2e The VLPs disclosed herein for generating an immune response against influenza viruses present M2e protein. In certain embodiments, the amino acid sequence of the M2e protein presented in the VLP is SLLTEVETPIRNEWGCRCNDSSD (SEQ ID NO. 9). In preferred embodiments, the VLPs present a dimeric M2e protein, where two monomeric M2e proteins are linked with a linker sequence. In some aspects, the linker is a glycine serine linker sequence. In particular embodiments, the amino acid sequence of dimeric M2e protein presented by the VLPs is set forth in SEQ ID NO. 10. b. Recombinant Immune Complex with M2e The influenza virus RIC comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain and M2e wherein the M2e is genetically fused to the immunoglobulin heavy chain. In certain embodiments, the amino acid sequence of the M2e protein presented in the RIC is SLLTEVETPIRNEWGCRCNDSSD (SEQ ID NO. 9). In certain embodiments, the influenza virus RIC comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain linked to a M2e dimer. The M2e dimer is formed from a glycine linkage sequence linking two M2e proteins. In some embodiments, the influenza virus RIC is a C\u2014RIC or N-RIC. c. Methods of Production It has been shown that M2e and M2e-containing vaccines has been able to be expressed effectively in plants (Nemchinov & Natilla, 2007). RICs comprising M2e and VLPs presenting M2e can be produced in plants using a geminiviral expression vector (see SEQ ID NOs. 19 and 20), and the VLPs and RICs can be extracted and purified from plants accordingly to methods established in the art. Zika Virus Vaccine Compositions In some embodiments, the disclosure relates to vaccine compositions that target zika virus and methods of generating an immune response in a mammalian subject against zika virus. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is a part of the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae (Oliveira et al., 2017). Currently, the genus Flavivirus consists of fifty-three documented species along with a growing number of tentative species (Simon et al., 2017). These viruses produce a single polyprotein that is later cleaved into three structural proteins (C, prM and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (Oliveira et al., 2017). The prM (precursor transmembrane M) protein is proteolytically cleaved during virion maturation by a host cell protease to create the membrane (M) and pr protein. On a mature virus particle, a hundred and eighty copies of the envelope glycoprotein (E) and membrane (M) proteins can be found arranged in an icosahedral structure with 90 E dimers. This structure covers the viral surface (Boigard et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2016). ZIKV is considered a global public health threat due to factors involving its spread and involvement with neonatal complications. From 2015-2017, Zika viral transmission has been reported in over 69 countries worldwide. In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in response to the growing number of global Zika infections and the increasing amount of evidence suggesting links between Zika infection and congenital/neurological complications such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome and neonatal microcephaly (Rabaan et al., 2017; Wilder-Smith et al., 2018). Since then, there has been significant interest in developing vaccines and other therapeutic aids against the Zika virus. At this time, there are 45 vaccine candidates that were tested in non-clinical studies. Of the vaccine candidates that advanced past animal pre-clinical studies, several are in phase 1 human clinical trials and at least one is in phase 2 clinical trials ((NIAID); Durbin and Wilder-Smith, 2017; Wilder-Smith et al., 2018). The main antigenic determinant of the virus is the envelope glycoprotein (E) since it is available on the surface of the mature virus particle and can be targeted by a number of neutralizing antibodies (Yang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017). For this reason, many vaccine candidates utilize the ZIKV E protein ((NIAID)). One example is the experimental vaccine candidate currently in phase 2 clinical trials. This DNA vaccine candidate encodes the ZIKV wild type precursor transmembrane M (prM) and envelope (E) protein ((NIAID)). However, as of now, DNA vaccines are not licensed for human use and may have some risk of chromosomal integration via nonhomologous recombination (Barzon and Pal{dot over (u)}, 2017). Plant-produced, vaccines can potentially overcome safety and cost concerns associated with other ZIKV vaccine candidates, including inactivated virus, mRNA or DNA-based vaccines, and adenovirus-vectored vaccines. Plant expression systems are highly scalable and avoid many of the costs of traditional systems, such as expensive bioreactors, thereby allowing cheaper production of biological products (Alam et al., 2018; Tus\u00e9 et al., 2014). Additionally, using a recombinant protein vaccine also removes the safety concerns of improperly inactivated virus, genomic insertion, and the development of immune responses to adenoviral vectors (Yang et al., 2018). The E protein contains three structurally separate domains (Zhang et al., 2017). Of these domains, the E domain III (ZE3) is a promising target for vaccine development since it has been shown to contain a number of epitopes for neutralizing, type-specific monoclonal antibodies (Dai et al., 2016; Haiyan Zhao et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017). Since neutralizing antibodies developed against approved vaccines for yellow fever virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus, both of which are closely related to ZIKV, appear to have a correlation with viral protection (Belmusto-Worn et al., 2005; Heinz et al., 2007), ZE3 is an important target. Furthermore, ZE3-specific antibodies do not show dengue virus antibody dependent enhancement (Stettler et al., 2016). Antibody-dependent enhancement occurs when non-neutralizing antibodies developed in response to one viral infection cross-reacts and forms complexes with another virus upon infection. These complexes bind to cells with Fc-gamma or complement-associated receptors and are taken up by myeloid cells. However, since the antibodies merely bind to and do not neutralize the virus, the severity of viral infection is enhanced (Taylor et al., 2015). Published work utilizing a subunit ZE3 protein vaccine candidate showed an absence of antibody dependent enhancement of dengue viral infection (Yang et al., 2017). This result, along with the presence of known, neutralizing antibody epitopes on ZE3, render this antigen a prime target for vaccination. In certain implementations of the method of generating an immune response in a mammalian subject against zika virus, the method comprises administering to the mammalian subject a VLP presenting a zika virus antigen. In some implementations, a RIC comprising a zika virus antigen is also administered. In some aspects, RIC comprising a zika virus antigen and VLP presenting a zika virus antigen are co-administered. In some aspects, the RIC and the VLP are coadministered in a ratio of 1:1. In certain implementations, the VLP and the RIC are administered to the mammalian subject in three vaccination events, wherein each vaccination event comprises administration of one dose of the VLP and/or one dose of the RIC. In some implementations, the three vaccination events are performed within a period of 8 weeks. In some aspects, two vaccination events are separated by a period of at least 14 day, at least 21 days, at least 28 days, at least 35 days, at least 42 days, at least 49 days, at least 56 days, about three weeks, about four weeks, about five week, about six weeks, about seven weeks, or about eight weeks. As used herein, the term \"about\" refers to \u00b13 days, \u00b12 days, or \u00b11 day. The methods of administering the VLP and RIC may be any established methods of vaccination in the prior art. In some instances, the VLP and RIC are administered subcutaneously. In some implementations, the VLP and RIC are administered with an adjuvant. a.

In other aspects, the amino acid sequences of ZE3, ZE, and Zse may be functionally equivalent versions of corresponding regions of GenBank Accession No. AMC13911 from other strains of zika virus, for example, the corresponding sequences of ZE3, be produced in plants using a geminiviral expression vector (see SEQ ID NOs. 34 and 35), and the VLPs can be extracted and purified from plants accordingly to methods established in the art. b. Recombinant Immune Complex with Zika Virus Antigens The zika virus RIC comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain and a zika virus antigen genetically fused to the immunoglobulin heavy chain. In some embodiments, the zika virus RIC is a C\u2014RIC or N-RIC.

In some aspects, the amino acid sequence of ZE is set forth in residues 352-412 of GenBank Accession No. AMC13911. In some aspects, the amino acid sequence of Zse is set forth in residues 291-693 of GenBank Accession No. AMC13911. In other aspects, the amino acid sequences of ZE3, ZE, and Zse may be functionally equivalent versions of corresponding regions of GenBank Accession No. AMC13911 from other strains of zika virus, for example, the corresponding sequences of ZE3, be produced in plants using a geminiviral expression vector (see SEQ ID NOs. 36-38), and the RICs can be extracted and purified from plants accordingly to methods established in the art.Illustrative, Non-Limiting Example in Accordance with Certain Embodiments The disclosure is further illustrated by the following examples that should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents, and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the Figures, are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.Example 1. Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Compositions a. Materials and Methods i. Vector Construction 1. Virus-Like Particle As most broadly neutralizing HPV antibodies are derived from the highly conserved N-terminal region of L2, amino acids 14-122 used to create HBc VLPs. L2 with flanking linker regions was inserted into the tip of the -helical spike of an HBc gene copy which was fused to another copy of HBc lacking the L2 insert. This arrangement allows the formation of HBc dimers that contain only a single copy of L2, increasing VLP stability (Peyret et al. 2015). This heterodimer referred to as HBche-L2. A dicot plant-optimized HPV16 L2 coding sequence was designed based upon the sequence of GenBank Accession No. CAC51368.1 and synthesized in vitro using synthetic oligonucleotides by the method described (Stemmer et al., 1995). The plant-optimized L2 nucleotide sequence encoding residues 1-473 is posted at GenBank Accession No. KC330735. PCR end-tailoring was used to insert Xbal and the L2 aa 14-122 ID NO. (SEQ ID NO. 2: G GGACTAGTTGGGGCACCAGCATC). The SpeI site was fused to a sequence encoding a 6His tag, and the resulting fusion was cloned into a geminiviral replicon vector (Diamos, 2016) to produce pBYe3R2K2Mc-L2(14-122)6H. The HBche heterodimer VLP system was adapted from Peyret et al (2015). Using the plant optimized HBc gene (Huang et al., 2009), inventors constructed a DNA sequence encoding a dimer comprising HBc aa 1-149, a linker and HBc aa 78-176. The dimer sequence was generated using multiple PCR steps including overlap extensions and insertion of BamHI and SpeI restriction sites flanking the L2 L2-122-Spe-R (SEQ ID NO. 2). The HBche-L2 coding sequence was inserted into a geminiviral replicon binary vector pBYR2eK2M ( 2. Recombinant Immune Complex The recombinant immune complex (RIC) vector was adapted from Kim et al., (2015). The HPV-16 L2 (aa 14-122) segment was inserted into the BamHI and SpeI sites of the gene encoding humanized mAb 6D8 heavy chain, resulting in 6D8 epitope-tagged L2. The heavy chain fusion was inserted into an expression cassette linked to a 6D8 kappa chain expression cassette, all inserted into a geminiviral replicon binary vector ( ii. Agroinfiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana Binary vectors were separately introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 by electroporation. The resulting strains were verified by restriction digestion or PCR, grown overnight at 30\u00b0 C., and used to infiltrate leaves of 5- to 6-week-old N. benthamiana maintained at 23-25\u00b0 C. Briefly, the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 5,000 g and then resuspended in infiltration buffer (10 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), pH 5.5 and 10 mM MgSO4) to OD600=0.2, unless otherwise described. The resulting bacterial suspensions were injected by using a syringe without needle into leaves through a small puncture (Huang et al. 2004). Plant tissue was harvested after 5 DPI, or as stated for each experiment. Leaves producing GFP were photographed under UV illumination generated by a B-100AP lamp (UVP, Upland, Calif.). iii. Protein Extraction Total protein extract was obtained by homogenizing agroinfiltrated leaf samples with 1:5 (w:v) ice cold extraction buffer (25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mg/mL sodium ascorbate, 0.3 mg/mL PMSF) using a Bullet Blender machine (Next Advance, Averill Park, N.Y.) following the manufacturer's instruction. To enhance solubility, homogenized tissue was rotated at room temperature or 4\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The crude plant extract was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. Necrotic leaf tissue has reduced water weight, which can lead to inaccurate measurements based on leaf mass. Therefore, extracts were normalized based on total protein content by Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. iv. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Clarified plant protein extract was mixed with sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% For reducing conditions, 0.5M DTT was added, and the samples were boiled for 10 minutes prior to loading. Polyacrylamide gels were either transferred to a PVDF membrane or stained with Coomassie stain (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. For L2 detection, the protein transferred membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBST (PBS with 0.05% tween-20) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. anti-rabbit antibody was detected with ECL reagent (Amersham). v. Immunization of Mice and Sample Collection All animals were handled in accordance to the Animal Welfare Act and Arizona State University IACUC. Female BALB/C mice, 6-8 weeks with Imject\u00ae Alum (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.). In all treatment groups, the total weight of antigen was set to deliver an equivalent 5 g of L2. Doses were given on days 0, 21, and 42. Serum collection was done as described (Santi et al. 2008) by submandibular bleed on days 0, 21, 42, and 63. vi. Antibody Measurements Mouse antibody titers were measured by ELISA. Bacterially-expressed L2 (amino acids 11-128) was bound to 96-well high-binding polystyrene plates (Corning), and the plates were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST. After washing the wells with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20), the diluted mouse sera were added and incubated. Mouse antibodies were detected by incubation with polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). The plate was developed with TMB substrate (Pierce) and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. Endpoint titers were taken as the reciprocal of the lowest dilution which produced an OD450 reading twice the background. IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were with goat-anti IgG2a peroxidase HBche-L2 were initially incubated on 75/300 mesh grids coated with formvar. Following incubation, samples were briefly washed twice with deionized water then negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. Transmission electron microscopy was performed with a Phillips CM-12 microscope, and images were acquired with a Gatan model 791 CCD camera. viii. Statistical Analysis The significance of vaccine treatments and virus neutralization was measured by non-parametric Mann-Whitney test using GraphPad prism software. Two stars (**) indicates p values <0.05. Three stars (***) indicates p values <0.001. b. Design and Expression of HBc VLPs and RIC Displaying HPV16 L2 BeYDV plant acids 14-122 of HPV16 L2 were fused with linker to the C-terminus of the 6D8 antibody heavy chain and tagged with the 6D8 epitope (Kim et al. 2015). A BeYDV vector ( After rigorous genetic optimization, the N. benthamiana system is capable of producing very high levels of recombinant protein, up to 30-50% of the total soluble plant protein, in 4-5 days (Diamos et al. 2016). Using this system, we produced and purified milligram quantities of fully assembled and potently immunogenic HBc VLPs HPV L2 through a simple purification process ( c. Purification and Characterization of HBche-L2 and L2 RIC To assess the assembly of HBc-L2 VLP, clarified plant extracts containing either HBche-L2 or HBche were analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation. HBche-L2 sedimented largely with HBche, which is known to form VLP, though a small increase in density was observed with HBche-L2, perhaps due to the incorporation of L2 into the virus particle ( L2 RIC was purified from plant tissue by protein G affinity chromatography. By SDS-PAGE, an appropriately sized band was visible >150 kDa that was highly pure ( d. Mouse Immunization with HBche-L2 and L2 RIC Groups of Balb/c mice (n=8) were immunized, using alum as adjuvant, with three doses each of 5 g L2 delivered as either L2 alone, HBche-L2 VLP, L2 RIC, or a combination of half VLP and half RIC. VLP and RIC, alone or combined, greatly enhanced antibody titers compared to L2 alone by more than an order of magnitude at all time points tested ( In vitro neutralization of HPV16 pseudovirions showed that the VLP and RIC groups greatly enhanced neutralization compared to L2 alone ( In this study, by displaying amino acids 11-128 on the surface of plant-produced HBc VLPs, L2 antibody titers as high as those seen with L1 vaccines were generated ( Mice immunized with L2 alone had highly variable antibody titers, with titers spanning two orders of magnitude. By contrast, the VLP and VLP/RIC groups had much more homogenous antibody responses, with no animals below an endpoint titer of 1:1,000,000 ( Fc gamma receptors are present on immune cells and strongly impact antibody effector functions such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (Jefferis 2009). In mice, interactions are controlled in part by IgG subtypes. IgG1 is associated with a Th2 response and has limited effector functions. By contrast, IgG2a is associated with a Th1 response and more strongly binds complement components (Neuberger and Rajewsky 1981) and Fc receptors (Radaev 2002), enhancing effector functions and opsonophagocytosis by macrophages (Takai et al. 1994). Immunization with L2 alone was found to produce low levels of IgG2a, however immunization with RIC and VLP produced significant increases in IgG2a titers. VLP-containing groups in particular showed a 3-fold increase in the ratio of IgG2a to IgG1 antibodies ( The glycosylation state of the Fc receptor also plays an important role in antibody function. Advances in glycoengineering have led to the development of transgenic plants with silenced fucosyl- and xylosyl-transferase genes capable of producing recombinant proteins with authentic human N-glycosylation (Strasser et al. 2008). Antibodies produced in this manner have more homogenous glycoforms, resulting in improved interaction with Fc gamma and complement receptors compared to the otherwise identical antibodies produced in mammalian cell culture systems (Zeitlin et al. 2011; Hiatt et al. 2014; Strasser et al. 2014; Marusic et al. 2017). As the known mechanisms by which RIC vaccines increase immunogenicity of an antigen depend in part on Fc and complement receptor binding, HPV L2 RIC were produced in transgenic plants with silenced fucosyl- and xylosyl-transferase. Consistent with these data, we found that L2 RIC strongly enhanced the immunogenicity of L2 ( of HPV Pseudovirions Neutralization papilloma pseudoviruses (HPV 16, 18, and with sera from mice immunized IP with HBc-L2 VLP and L2(11-128) showed neutralization of HPV 16 at titers of 400-1600 and 200-800, respectively (Table 1). More with VLP antisera that cross-neutralized HPV 58 at titers ranging from 400-800 (Table 1), while anti-L2(11-128) sera neutralized HPV 18 at a titer of 200 and HPV 58 at a titer of 400 (Table 1). None of the sera from intranasal-immunized mice demonstrated neutralizing activity, consistent with lower anti-L2 titers for intranasal than for intraperitoneal immunized mice. a. Methods i. Vector Construction A codon-optimized sequence for the expression of a dimeric human consensus M2e protein (SLLTEVETPIRNEWGCRCNDSSDGGSGGSLLTEVETPIRNEWGCRCNDSSD, SEQ ID NO. 10) in N. benthamiana was designed (Neirynck et al., 1999; Blokhina et al., 2013; Mardanova et al., 2015; Krishnavajhala et al., 2018), and restriction sites for the restriction enzymes BamHI (New England Biolabs) and SpeI (New England Biolabs) and binding sites for the M13F and M13R primers flanking the BamHI and SpeI sites were added to the ends of the sequence to maximize compatibility with existing vectors. M2e monomers were linked by a glycine-serine linker to minimize interference of the linker with the protein and RIC as a whole. Tandem repeats of M2e increases the chance of cross-linking occurring in B cell receptors on B cells and also increases the chances of M2e being degraded and displayed by proteosomal digestion and MHC presentation. This increases the immunogenicity of the vaccine. 250 ng of the sequence was ordered from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa) as a gBlock, which was promptly resuspended by centrifuging the geneblock for 5 seconds at 3,000\u00d7g and resuspending the resulting pellet in TE buffer to a final concentration of 10 ng/l. The geneblock was then amplified by high-fidelity PCR using and M13R primers and run on a 1% agarose gel, with the resulting band being excised and the DNA contained within being isolated by dissolving the gel fragment in sodium iodide (a chaotropic salt that dissolves agarose) and heating for approximately 10 minutes. The DNA was precipitated out of the solution by mixing the solution with a small amount (7 l) of silicon dioxide suspension, which binds DNA under high salt conditions. The solution was pelleted, washed with 50% ethanol/50 mM NaCl to remove NaI, and the DNA was eluted from the silicon dioxide with sterile water. Following this, the amplified M2e sequence was then digested with BamHI and SpeI. The vector backbone plasmid, pBYR11eMa-h6D8-L2, was digested with SbfI and SpeI for the vector fragment, and separately with SbfI and BamHI for the 2264 bp fragment. The three fragments were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) overnight in a 16\u00b0 C. water bath. The ligated plasmid was then precipitated using ammonium acetate and 2-propanol to increase purity and decrease the volume of the plasmid in solution (the precipitation allowed for a volume reduction from 20 l to 3 l, vastly increasing the concentration of the plasmid in solution). Following precipitation, 2 l of the plasmid was electroporated into competent DH5a E. coli, which was allowed to grow in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube containing 500 l YENB broth for one hour to allow the E. coli to recover. This 500 l of broth was subsequently plated onto an LB+kanamycin plate and allowed to grow overnight in a 37\u00b0 C. incubator. Ten colonies were selected and screened via PCR using the 6D8H-F and Ext3-R primers (Table 1) with the two colonies producing the brightest bands on the agarose gel being selected for plasmid preparation via lysis of the cells (using an EDTA-containing buffer to prevent DNAse activity) and precipitation of the plasmid through mixing with ammonium acetate and ethanol to precipitate the DNA. pBYR11eMa-h6D8M2e was isolated via centrifugation and resuspension in TE buffer. Isolated pBYR11eMa-h6D8M2e from the E. coli were Sanger sequenced in the region of the plasmid containing M2e to ensure sequence integrity. To generate the plasmid encoding the VLP, pBYR2eK2M-HBcheM2e was constructed. pET-28b (Novalgen) M2e geneblock digested with NcoI and XhoI. These fragments were ligated to generate the pET28b-M2e. Then, the plasmid pBY037P3-HbcheL2ic the M2e gBlock were digested with BamHI and SpeI, with the fragments being ligated to form pBY037P3-HbcheM2e, which contained M2e fused to the MIR of an HBc monomer. pBY037P3-HbcheM2e was digested with NcoI and SpeI to obtain the 926 bp fragment. pBYR2eK2M-HbcheZE3 was digested with SbfI and SpeI for the vector fragment, and separately with SbfI and NcoI to obtain the 821 bp fragment with promoter and 5UTR. These fragments were ligated together to form pBYR2eK2M-HbcheM2e, which contained the HBc dimer with M2e inserted into the second HBc monomer's MIR region. Table 2 lists nucleotide sequences used in the construction of the vectors. ii. Agroinfiltration After verifying the presence of M2e in pBYR1leMa-h6D8M2e and pBYR2eK2M-HBcheM2e, the plasmids were electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA 105 cells, which were allowed to recover in 500 l YENB broth for one hour. The cells were then plated on LB+kan plates and incubated at 28\u00b0 C. for two days. Following this, cultures of the transformed A. tumefaciens were grown overnight at 28\u00b0 C. on a shaker in YENB, rifampicin (2.775 g/ml) and kanamycin (50 g/ml). These cultures were PCR screened after which cultures identified to contain pBYR11eMa-h6D8M2e and pBYR2eK2M-HBcheM2e were spun down and resuspended in 1\u00d7 infiltration buffer to an OD of 0.260. Three GnGn N. benthamiana plants (Strasser et al., 2008) ranging from five to six weeks old were infiltrated (specifically in the leaves) with the A. tumefaciens suspensions (Huang and Mason, 2004) and allowed to grow at room temperature for five days. The plants were watered daily. iii. Extraction and Purification of Recombinant Influenza A Vaccines Five days after agroinfiltration, plant leaves were homogenized with an electric blender in ice cold buffer (100 mM tris, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM PMSF, 0.1 Triton, pH=8.0). No significant necrosis was observed in any of the infiltrated or uninfiltrated leaves. The blended plant leaves were then stirred for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., after which the solution was filtered through four-ply miracloth to remove plant fibers. 1 ml of this solution was taken as a sample of 'crude extract' and frozen at 80\u00b0 C. for later analysis. 1M phosphoric acid was then added to lower the pH of the extraction to 4.6 for one minute to precipitate plant proteins like RuBisCo, with 2M Tris Base being added to raise the pH of the sample back up to 7.6. The extraction was then centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The supernatant was isolated and centrifuged for another 30 minutes at 16,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C. Then, the supernatant was again isolated and centrifuged for a final 10 minutes at 16,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C. to remove as much precipitated plant protein and other insoluble matter in the extraction as possible (as RICs are present in the soluble fraction). The supernatant was then run through vacuum filter sterilizers (pore size=0.45 micron) to remove any remnant bacteria that might have remained after centrifugation. For the M2e-RIC, a protein G resin column (containing protein G conjugated to agarose beads) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass., USA) was prepared by running the RIC extraction buffer through the column. The extraction was then run through the prepared column, after which the column was washed again with the RIC extraction buffer again to remove any final contaminants from the column. The RICs were then eluted from the column using a glycine solution (100 mM glycine, pH=2.5), with five 1.5 ml elutions being taken from the column and pH-neutralized using Tris base (100 l of 1M Tris pH=8.0 in each elution). 50 l aliquots from each elution were immediately frozen in a 80\u00b0 C. freezer for later analysis to prevent the larger elutions from degrading due to frequent freezing and thawing. Additionally, small volumes from each elution were used in spectrophotometry to determine the concentration of RICs present in each elution. For the M2e-VLP, a sucrose gradient and subsequent ultracentrifugation was used to purify the VLPs out of the plant extract as described herein elsewhere. Briefly, 6 mL of extract was centrifuged at 148,000\u00d7g for 2.5 hours at 4\u00b0 C. through a 13 ml sucrose cushion gradient composed of layered 25% and 70% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). VLPs, which a density between the density 25% and 70% sucrose, was extracted out of the cushion and dialyzed against PBS for further purification and to remove residual sucrose. The use of a sucrose cushion allows for more gentle purification of the VLPs and can increase the yield of the purification (Peyret et al., 2015). The purified M2e-VLPs were then analyzed via spectrophotometry and frozen at 80\u00b0 C. An Eppendorf BioPhotometer RS232c was used to determine the concentration of RICs within each elution. Using the Beer-Lambert Law (A=*b*c, where A=absorbance, 6=extinction coefficient, b=length of the path of the light in centimeters, and c=concentration), concentration can of the RIC can be determined by rearranging the equation to solve for 'c'. The extinction coefficient of human IgG is approximately 1.4 (Eisenberg, 1976), and with the length of the path of the light being 1 cm, A280 values can be used to determine concentration. iv. Western Blotting and Coomassie Staining For the RIC, samples of crude extract, the extract post-filtration, the extract post-acid precipitation, the wash buffer, and five elutions, and a protein ladder standard (GOLDBIO BLUEstain) were run on two 10% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) simultaneously under non-reducing conditions. Fresh SDS was added to the running buffer to maximize resolution. One gel was stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye for an hour, after which the gel was destained overnight using deionized water. The other gel was used to transfer proteins to a PVDF membrane for 20 minutes at 110V. The membrane was blocked in 5% PBSTM (1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing tween and 5% skim milk) overnight at 4\u00b0 C., after which the membrane was rinsed in deionized water three times. Then, the membrane was rotated in a 37\u00b0 C. incubator in a 1% PBSTM (1\u00d7PBS and tween and 1% skim milk) solution containing mouse anti-6D8 antibody (Wilson et al., 2000) at a 1:2000 dilution to detect the 6D8 epitope tag on the RIC (Phoolcharoen et al., 2011). Following this, the membrane was washed again in deionized water and incubated and rotated at 37\u00b0 C. in a 1% containing goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) at a 1:500 dilution for one hour. After this, the membrane was washed in deionized water and exposed to a mixture of developing reagents. The membrane was used to develop photosensitive film at an exposure time of 1 minute in the dark. Additional SDS-PAGE gels were run under similar conditions and using an anti-M2e antibody, MAb 65 (Kolpe et al., 2018) as the primary antibody for western blotting and mouse-anti-kappa chain antibody as the secondary antibody. MAb 65 was expressed in plants and purified in-house. Both RICs and VLPs were probed for the presence of M2e. v. Electron Microscopy Purified samples of the M2e VLP were incubated on 75/300 mesh grids coated with formvar and washed twice with deionized water. The VLPs were then negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM was performed with a Phillips CM-12 microscope, and images were acquired with a Gatan model 791 CCD camera. vi. Immunization of Mice All mice were handled in compliance with ASU IACUC regulations and in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. Groups of 6 female Balb/c mice, 6-8 weeks old, were immunized subcutaneously with three doses of antigen, each containing an equal mass of 5 g of M2e presented on either VLPs or a 1:1 ratio of the M2e-RIC and M2e-VLP. Doses were administered in a 1:1 ratio with the alum adjuvant Imject Alum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.). Doses were administered on day 0, 28, and 56, and serum collection was done as described (Santi et al., 2008) by submandibular bleed on days 0, 28, 56, and 86. vii. Antibody Quantification Mouse sera were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 100 l of a stock solution of 1 mg/ml synthetic monomeric human consensus M2e peptide (GenScript Biotech Corp., NJ) was diluted into 5.8 ml of 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (15 mM Na2CO3, 35 mM NaHCO3, pH=9.6) (Ebrahimi et al., 2012) to generate a 17 g/ml solution of M2e peptide in carbonate buffer. 50 l of this solution was used to coat each well of 96-well plates (850 ng/well) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Following this, plates were allowed to warm to room temperature for 20 minutes, after which the plates were rinsed thrice with PBST and blocked with 100 l of 5% PBSTM per well at room temperature for 15 minutes. Mouse sera were diluted in 1% PBSTM to dilutions ranging from 1:50 to 1:6250 for dose one, 1:8,000 to 1:1,000,000 for dose two, and 1:40,000 to 1:5,000,000 for dose three. After blocking with 5% PBSTM, 50 l of diluted mouse sera were added to each well and the plate was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The following day, the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes and then rinsed thrice with PB ST. Following this, a mixture of goat anti-mouse IgG2a antibodies, goat anti-mouse IgG1 antibodies, goat anti-mouse kappa chain antibodies, and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies, all conjugated to HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., TX) in 1% PBSTM was prepared. Each antibody was present in the solution at a 1:5700 dilution. This solution was used to detect the total antibody titers within each sera sample by adding 50 l of the mixture to each well and subsequently incubating the plates at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. Furthermore, additional plates used to determine the titers of IgG2a and IgG1 within each sample. Plates were rinsed five times with PBST and incubated for 45 minutes with 50 l of TMB (3,3,5,5-Tetramethylbenzidine) being added to each well. After this, the TMB-HRP reaction was stopped through the addition of HCl and the absorbance of the plates were read using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax 340PC Microplate Reader at GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Sofware, Inc.) to calculate the geometric mean of the ELISA results to determine geometric mean titers. viii. Analysis of Cytokine Production in Mice Mouse splenocytes were removed and homogenized via mashing in a 70 m nylon strainer with the plunger of a 3 ml syringe. The strainer and plunger were then washed using 13 of RPMI complete (RPMI, 10% heat-inactivated PBS, 1% P/S/G) into a microcentrifuge tube to collect cells. Cells were then centrifuged for 5 mins at 1200 RPM at 4\u00b0 C., with the supernatant being removed thereafter and the cells being resuspended in 2 ml red cell lysis buffer (ACK) and incubated for 2 minutes at room temperature. The cells were then quenched in 8 ml RPMI complete and centrifuged again for 5 minutes at 1200 RPM at 4\u00b0 C. The cell pellet was then washed twice with 10 ml RPMI complete and subsequently resuspended in 2 ml RPMI. Splenocytes were then plated in 96-well round bottom plates at a concentration of 106 cells per well. The plate was then centrifuged and the splenocytes were resuspended in 180 l of assay media (BD Biosciences-US)). Splenocytes were then exposed l of 10 g/ml synthetic M2e peptide (GenScript Biotech Corp., NJ), 20 l of RPMI complete, or 20 l PMI/ionomycin) and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 hours. Following incubation, cells were pelleted at 1300 rpm for 3 minutes, the supernatant was removed, and cells were washed with 1\u00d7 fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer. Cells were stained with anti-CD8 (1:100) and anti-CD4 (1:100) in 100 l FACS buffer and incubated for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., after which cells were washed twice with FACS buffer to remove excess unbound stain. The cells were then fixed and permeabilized through resuspension in 100 l of Fixation/Permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences, USA). Cells were then stained for intracellular cytokines using 50 l of staining solution; CD4 responses assayed via anti-IL-21, anti-IFN- in USA). while CD8 responses were assayed via staining with a solution dilutions of anti-IL-2, anti-TNF, and anti-IFN- in Permeabilization/Wash buffer. Cells were then washed twice with Permeabilization/Wash buffer, resuspended in 200 l FACS buffer, and analyzed via FACS using an LSR Fortessa ( b. Construction of Recombinant Influenza Vaccines Two recombinant universal influenza A vaccines were developed and expressed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transfer of geminiviral vectors into glycoengineered Nicotiana benthamiana plants (Strasser et al., 2008). The vaccines, using both the recombinant immune complex (MC) and hepatitis B core antigen (HbcAg) virus-like particles (VLP) as vaccine platforms to boost immunogenicity, presented a consensus sequence of the ectodomain of the matrix 2 protein of human influenza A, M2e (SLLTEVETPIRNEWGCRCNDSSD, SEQ ID NO. 9). The antigen was constructed as a dimer, with a 2\u00d7GGS linker linking the two copies of M2e together to minimize steric hindrance and other unwanted interactions between the two copies, codon-optimized for expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, and inserted into the C-terminal end of the human IgG 6D8 heavy chain gene encoded in pBYR11eMa-h6D8M2e ( c. Production of the M2e-RIC and M2e-VLP in Plants After the expression and purification of the recombinant vaccines via protein G chromatography for the RIC and sucrose gradient purification and dialysis for the VLP, samples were characterized via SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and western blotting ( d. Analysis of Mouse Sera and Splenocytes Two groups of five BALB/c mice were immunized with either the M2e-VLP alone or a combination of the M2e-RIC and the M2e-VLP at days 0, 28, and 56, with bleeds at 0, 28, 56, and 86. Mouse sera was analyzed via ELISA, with total antibody titers being measured after each bleed, and IgG1, and IgG2a titers being measured at the conclusion of day 63. Total antibody titers were consistently 2-3 times higher at all time points in the M2e-RIC/M2e-VLP combination group, though the ratio of IgG2a to IgG1, was lower in the combination group relative to the group that received the M2e-VLP alone ( Both IgG1 and IgG2a play important roles in viral immunity against influenza; in one study, mice with high expression of IgG1 had lower lung viral titers and high influenza virus neutralization, but lower survival rate when challenged with significantly high doses of influenza virus (Huber et al., 2006). Mice that had both isotypes fared the best, though it was noted that mice that had low IgG1 expression and high IgG2a had the same survival rates as those that had equivalent expression of both IgG1 and IgG2a (Huber et al., 2006). This could be due to IgG2a antibodies' propensity to stimulate complement activation much more effectively than IgG1 in mice (Neuberger & Rajewsky, 1981). The data presented suggest that, if mice were challenged with high doses of influenza, those that received the VLP only would have better outcomes than those receiving both groups. Splenocyte analysis revealed that mice vaccinated with the M2e-VLP had higher levels of IFN- and IL-4 positive splenocytes when stimulated with synthetic M2e peptide than mice vaccinated with both vaccines. Interestingly, mice receiving the combination vaccine had, on average, lower proportions of IFN- and IL-4 positive splenocytes post-stimulation than both pre-stimulation cells and cells from unvaccinated mice ( Although conventional RICs consists of an antibody, linked via its C-terminus, to an antigen that is followed by an epitope tag for the antibody, the versatility of the RIC platform can be expanded by fusing antigens to the N-terminus of the antibody in an RIC. Thus, antigens with inaccessible N-termini can now be easily used in RICs. a. Vector Creation and Expression of N-RIC A bean yellow dwarf expression vector containing dual-expression cassettes was used to create the N-RIC (Kim et al., 2015). One cassette contained the antigenic coding sequence (either Zika soluble envelope protein (ZsE) or domain zika virus domain III protein (ZDIII)) fused via a short linker to the standard RIC antibody heavy chain that was in turn linked to the antibody epitope tag. The second cassette contained the antibody light chain. Following confirmation of the recombinant plasmid by PCR and restriction digests, the plasmid was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 and confirmed by PCR. Agro cultures were grown overnight in YENB+appropriate antibiotics for selection and used for infiltration of 4- to 6-week-old N. benthamiana plants. b. Confirmation of N-RIC Assembly/Purification The leaves of transformed N. benthamiana were harvested 4-5 days post infiltration, and the extracted protein were used for a Western blot. The Western blot results showed appropriate assembly of both the ZsE N-RIC and ZDIII N-RIC ( Accordingly, an antigen (of various sizes) can be fused to the N-terminus of the RIC antibody. c. Mice Immunization Trials Immunization with ZDIII as both the N-RIC and C-RIC had highly comparable immune responses in mice as measured by total antibody titers and a plaque reduction neutralization test with live Zika virus. To test whether the ZDIII N-RIC produces a comparable immune response as a standard RIC (C-RIC), a mouse immunization trial was conducted with both the ZDIII N-RIC construct and a previously created ZDIII C-RIC. Six Balb/C mice were given three doses of either ZDIII N-RIC or RIC over an 8-week period. Serum samples were collected and the antibody titers determined by ELISA. The terminal bleed serum samples were collected a little over a month after the third dose. The ELISA results showed that both the N-RIC and C-RIC produced comparable antibody titers. A plaque reduction neutralization test conducted with live ZIKV virus showed that similar neutralization activity was seen following immunization with either RIC configuration.Example 4.

Vector Construction The maps of all expression vectors are provided in 1. pBYR11eM-h6D8ZE3 (ZE3 C-terminal RIC) A recombinant immune complex consisting of the humanized 6D8 mAb (h6D8) linked via the heavy chain C-terminus to the ZE3 antigen which is in turn linked to the 6D8 epitope tag. This construct is very similar to pBYR11eMa-h6D8-L2. The coding DNA sequence of ZIKV E protein (GenBank Accession No. AMC13911) was synthesized with optimized N. benthamiana codons (Integrated DNA Technologies, Iowa, USA). DNA encoding E protein domain III (ZE3, amino acids K591-T696) was PCR end-tailored to contain a BamHI site at 5 and SpeI site at 3 with primers ZE3-Bam-F and ZE3-Spe-R (Table 3), digested with BamHI and and ligated pBYR11eM-h6D8ZE3. 2. pBYR11eMa-BAZE3-Hgp371 (ZE3 N-terminal RIC) A recombinant immune complex consisting of the humanized h6D8 Ebola mAb fused via the heavy chain N-terminus to the C-terminus of the ZE3 antigen. The C-terminus of the antibody is linked to the 6D8 epitope tag. The construct was assembled by ligation of six DNA fragments: - - pBYR11eMa-h6D8-L2 was digested SbfI-XhoI for the vector fragment. - A DNA sequence encoding the promoter, 5UTR and barley alpha amylase signal peptide (BASP) was amplified from template pBYR2eK2M-6HplcCnetB (Hunter et al., 2019) with primers LIR-H3A and BASP-G-Bsa-R and then digested with SbfI and BsaI. - The ZE3 coding sequence was PCR end-tailored using primers ZE3-Bsa-F and ZE3-Spe-R, and the product was digested with BsaI and SpeI. - pLIT-L-BamH2 was digested SpeI and BsaI to obtain the 1016 bp fragment containing a linker and 5 end of the heavy chain sequence. pLIT-L-BamH2 was made thus: The template pBYR11eMa-h6D8-L2 was amplified by PCR with the primers H2-Bam-F and digested with SacI, and ligated with pLITMUS28 (New England Biolabs) digested likewise. A DNA segment encoding the linker \"(SGG)4SGS\" (SEQ ID NO. 42) was produced by annealing oligonucleotides Spe-L-Bam-F and Spe-L-Bam-R, which was ligated SpeI and BamHI to make pLIT-L-BamH2. - pKS-HH-gp371 (Kim et al., 2015) containing a DNA sequence encoding the epitope-tagged h6D8 heavy chain was digested with BsaI and SacI to obtain the 467 bp fragment. - pBYR11eMa-h6D8-L2 was digested SacI and XhoI to obtain the 2559 bp fragment containing the Ext 3 region, Rb7 MAR, SIR, and 35S promoter. 3. pBYe3R2K2Mc-BAHBcheZE3 (HBche-ZE3 VLP) A virus-like particle formed by using the Hepatitis B virus core (HBc) with the ZE3 antigen inserted via two linkers into the second of two tandemly-linked HBc copies. The final construct was assembled by ligation of five fragments: - - pBY-R2-GFP (Diamos & Mason, 2018b) was digested XhoI-ClaI to obtain the vector fragment, which contains a single nt mutation at position 3 from the C1 start codon. - The barley alpha amylase signal peptide (BASP) was fused to the N-terminus of the HBc coding sequence, by construction of pLIT-BAHBc. A DNA sequence encoding the 5 UTR and BASP was amplified from template pBYR2eK2M-6HplcCnetB (Hunter et al., 2019) with primers 35S-F and BASP-G-Bsa-R, and the product digested with XhoI and BsaI to obtain the 146 bp fragment. The HBc coding sequence was amplified by PCR from template pBYR2eK2M-HBche using primers HBc-Bsa-F and HBc176-Sac-R, and the product digested with BsaI and SacI. The two digested PCR products were ligated with pLITMUS28 (New England Biolabs) digested XhoI-SacI to make pLIT-BAHBc, which was digested XhoI-SalI to obtain the 570 bp fragment. - pBYR2eK2M-HBcheL2ic was digested SalI-KpnI to obtain the 311 bp fragment encoding the C-terminal part of the first HBc monomer, the segment linking HBc monomers 1 and 2, and the N-terminal part of the second HBc monomer. - A subclone was made from pBYR2eK2M-HBcheL2ic, named pUC-HBc176iL2c, containing DNA encoding a linker, the L2 antigen, a second linker, and HBc amino acids 78-176. The ZE3 BamHI-SpeI fragment (321 bp) was inserted into the BamHI-SpeI sites of pUC-HBc176iL2c to make pUC-HBc176iZE3, which was digested KpnI-SacI to obtain the 699 bp fragment) encoding an N-terminal linker, ZE3, a (Diamos Mason, 2018a) was digested SacI-ClaI to obtain a 2533 bp segment containing the Ext 3, 35S 3, MARc, SIR, and the C2 coding DNA. 4. pBYR11eM-h6D8-ZEFL62 (ZEFL RIC) A recombinant immune complex consisting of the h6D8 mAb linked via its heavy chain C-terminus to the Zika virus fusion loop antigen (Zika E E352-S412), with a C-terminal 6D8 epitope tag. A DNA segment encoding Zika E E352-S412 was amplified by PCR of the E protein plant-optimized gene using primers ZEE62-Bam-F and ZES122-Spe-R, and the product digested with BamHI and SpeI. The resulting 189 bp fragment was inserted to replace the ZE3 sequence in pBYR11eM-h6D8ZE3 at BamHI and SpeI, to to the HBche-ZE3 VLP with the Zika virus fusion loop antigen replacing the ZE3 antigen. - - The construct was assembled by ligation of fragments: - pBYe3R2K2Mc-BAHBcheZE3 was digested XhoI-SpeI for the vector fragment. - pBYe3R2K2Mc-BAHBcheZE3 was digested XhoI-SalI to obtain the 570 bp fragment. - pBYe3R2K2Mc-BAHBcheZE3 was digested SalI-BamHI to obtain the 337 bp fragment. - pBYR11eM-h6D8-ZEFL62 was digested BamHI-SpeI to obtain the 189 bp fragment encoding Zika E E352-S412. ii. Agroinfiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana Leaves BeYDV plant expression vectors for each construct were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 via electroporation. The resulting strains were verified by restriction digestion or PCR, grown overnight at 30 C, and used to infiltrate leaves of 5- to 6-week-old N. benthamiana maintained at 23-25\u00b0 C. For the RICs, a vector expressing both the ZE3-fused 6D8 heavy chain and the light chain was agroinfiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. The vector was similar to that previously described in (Kim et al., 2015) with the ZIKV Domain III as the antigen instead of the DENV antigen. Transgenic N. benthamiana plants that have been silenced for xylosyltransferase and fucosyltransferase enzymes were used since these plants produce a highly homogenous, human-like glycosylation pattern that can improve in vivo Fc receptor binding (Castilho and Steinkellner, 2012). Briefly, the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation for 8 minutes at 5,000 g and then resuspended in infiltration buffer (10 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), pH 5.5 and 10 mM MgSO4) to OD600=0.2, unless otherwise described. The resulting bacterial suspensions were injected by using a syringe without needle into leaves through a small puncture (Huang et al. 2004). Plant tissue was harvested after 5 days post infiltration (DPI), or as stated for each experiment. iii. C-RIC Purification 4-5 days post infiltration, the leaves were harvested and extracted in ice-cold, 1:2 w/v buffer at pH 7.4 (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 10 mg/mL sodium ascorbate, and 0.3 mg/mL PMSF). The remainder of the protein G column chromatography purification protocol was conducted as described. iv. N-RIC Purification The infiltration, extraction, and protein G purification for the N-terminal ZE3 MC was conducted according to the same protocol as described for the C-RIC. The only change was that the extraction buffer used for the N-RIC purification was at pH 9.5 instead of pH 8. v. ZEFL RIC The infiltrated leaf material was extracted in ice-cold, 1:2 w/v buffer at pH 9.5 (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 7M urea, 10 mg/mL sodium ascorbate, and 0.3 mg/mL PMSF). The rest of the protocol was conducted as written in the C-RIC purification. The only change was that the extract was diluted 1:1 in cold, pH 9.5 extraction buffer before loading the extract onto the column for protein G purification. This was done in order to lower the urea concentration so that the ZEFL RIC could bind to the protein G resin. This buffer was the same one used earlier for the extraction process. In addition, at this step, 1M phosphoric acid was added to set the pH of the extract to pH 7.5 in order to allow for optimal binding to the resin. vi. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Samples from the purified RIC elutions were mixed with SDS sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% (Bio-Rad). For reducing conditions, 300 mM DTT was added, and the samples were boiled for 10 minutes prior to loading. Polyacrylamide gels were either transferred to a PVDF membrane or stained with Coomassie stain (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. For ZE3 detection, the protein transferred membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBST (PBS with 0.05% tween-20) overnight at 4\u00b0 C., washed with PBST (3 washes, 5 minutes each), and probed with appropriate antibodies. The C-RIC samples were detected with goat anti-human IgG (Southern Biotech) antibody that was conjugated with horseradish peroxide (HRP) (Southern Biotech). The N-RIC samples were detected by mouse anti-human IgG (Fc-only) antibody conjugated with HRP (Southern Biotech). Bound antibody was detected with Pierce ECL western Blotting Substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific). vii. HBche-ZE3 VLP The vector containing the HBche-ZE3 VLP construct was agroinfiltrated into the leaves of 4-6-week-old N. benthamiana plants. At 4-5 DPI, the leaves were harvested, extracted in ice-cold, 1:2 w/v buffer at pH 7.4 (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 10 mg/mL sodium ascorbate, analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation. viii. Electron Microscopy To obtain the images of the HBche-ZE3 VLP, samples of HBche-ZE3 VLP partially purified by sedimentation were initially on 75/300 mesh grids coated with formvar. After incubation, the samples were washed twice with deionized water then negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. The transmission electron microscopy was performed with a Phillips CM-12 microscope. The images were acquired with a Gatan model 791 CCD camera. ix. HBche-ZEFL VLP Through agroinfiltration, the vector containing the HBche-ZEFL VLP was delivered into the leaves of 4- to 6-week-old N. benthamiana plants. At 4-5 DPI, the leaves were harvested, extracted in ice-cold, 1:2 w/v buffer at pH 7.4 (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 10 mg/mL sodium ascorbate, 0.3 mg/mL and analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation. After the sucrose gradient sedimentation, samples of the sucrose fractions were run on a Coomassie-stained gel. Upon reducing conditions, a band at the appropriate size was visible ( x. Immunization of Mice and Sample Collection Female BALB/C mice (6-8 weeks old) were immunized subcutaneously The antigens were either delivered alone or in various combinations of MC and VLP mixed at a ratio of 1:1. Most groups were given antigen mixed 1:1 with Imject Alum (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) prior to immunization. However, two groups, HBche-ZE3 alone and the HBche-ZE3+C-RIC, were not given alum as an adjuvant in order to test the effect of alum on the response elicited by the delivered vaccine antigens. All groups contained 6 mice. For the ZE3-containing groups, the total dose of antigen was set to deliver an equivalent 4 g of ZE3. For the ZEFL-containing groups, the total dose of antigen was 2 g. Doses were given on days 0, 28, and 56. Serum collection was done as described (Santi et al., 2008) by submandibular bleed on days 0, 28, and 56, and 86. All animals were handled in accordance to the Animal Welfare Act and Arizona State University IACUC. xi. Antibody Measurements Mouse antibody titers were measured by ELISA. Zika soluble ectodomain E (ZsE) protein (amino acids 291-693, 6-His tagged) was produced by agro-infiltration delivery of expression vector pBYe3R2K2Mc-BAZsE6H into leaves of N. benthamiana and purified by metal affinity chromatography. ZsE was bound to 96-well high-binding polystyrene plates (Corning). After the plates were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (PBS with 0.05% tween-20), the wells were washed with PB ST. Then, the diluted mouse sera from the terminal bleed were added, and the plate incubated at 37 C for 1 hour. Mouse antibodies were detected by incubation with polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). The plate was developed with TMB substrate (Pierce) and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. Endpoint titers were taken as the reciprocal of the lowest dilution which produced an OD450 reading twice the background. IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were with goat-anti mouse IgG1 or IgG2a horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Southern Biotech). Statistical analysis and determination of signification between the various vaccine treatment was done by non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests using GraphPad prism software. The results, which are displayed in b. C-RIC, N-RIC Production After purification by protein G affinity, C\u2014RIC and N-RIC samples were examined by SDS-PAGE and western blot. Staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue showd the C-RIC sample was highly pure and that the protein displayed expected molecular mass under nonreducing conditions (178 kDa) and reducing conditions (65.4 kDa and 25 kDa bands) ( Likewise, a Coomassie-stained gel containing samples of the purified N-RIC material showed appropriately sized bands under both reducing and non-reducing conditions that signified correctly assembled RICs ( c. HBche-ZE3 VLP Production Samples of the sucrose gradient preparations were run on a Coomassie-stained gel. Upon reducing conditions, bands at the appropriate size were visible ( d. ZEFL-RIC and ZEFL VLP Production The ZEFL-RIC and examined by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining ( e. Mouse Immunization Study BALB/c (6 immunized HBche-VLP either alone or in various combinations of RIC and VLP mixed 1:1. After the second dose ( These trends continued with the antibody titers measured after the third dose ( The ZEFL-containing groups performed equally well after dose 2 with no statistical significance seen between the titers elicited by either the ZEFL VLP alone or the ZEFL VLP+ZEFL RIC group. After dose three, a slight but statistically insignificant increase in antibody titers was observed in the combination group.REFERENCES CITED - (NIAID), N. I. of A. and I. D.
