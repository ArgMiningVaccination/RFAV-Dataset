Summaries Of The News: [ Average American Life Span Falls To Shortest Mark In Decades ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/average-american-life-span-falls-to-shortest-mark-in-decades/) Federal government data shows that an American child born in 2021 could expect to live to age 76.4. That number fell by almost eight months in 2021, following an even greater drop of 1.8 years in 2020. Covid and drug overdoses largely account for the negative shifts.

That decrease follows an already big decline of 1.8 years in 2020. As a result, the expected life span of someone born in the U.S. is now 76.4 years \u2014 the shortest it has been in nearly two decades.

Men, women and most racial groups lost ground. In some previous years, even when overall life expectancy declined, some groups advanced. \"This one, it's sort of across-the-board bad news,\" said Eileen Crimmins, a professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California who studies life expectancy around the world. \"We've gone since 1996 without improving.

Causes of death remained largely the same between 2020 and 2021, led by heart disease, cancer and COVID-19, all three of which occurred more often last year. Eight of the top 10 causes of death saw statistically significant increases in 2021 over 2020, including unintentional injury and stroke. Only Alzheimer's disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases declined among the leading causes of death.(Weintraub, 12/22) More on the link to drug overdoses \u2014 [ Los Angeles Times: Declining U.S. Life Expectancy Fell Further In 2021 Due To COVID And Drug Overdoses ](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-12-21/declining-u-s-life-expectancy-fell-further-in-2021-due-to-covid-and-drug-overdoses) The year 2021 saw 106,699 drug overdose deaths in the United States, the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics said in a separate report released Thursday.

Schumer took to the floor at 2 a.m. Thursday to say an agreement was near to speed up passage of the massive fiscal 2023 omnibus spending bill, after senators spent the day Wednesday wrangling behind the scenes. The chief dispute was over pandemic-era asylum restrictions that the Biden administration wants to lift, a move that Republicans and some Democrats say would exacerbate chaos at the border. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has an amendment to bar the administration from ending the so-called Title 42 policy; Republicans want a simple majority threshold for adoption, while Democrats want to raise the bar to 60 votes. \"It is my expectation we will be able to lock in an agreement on the omnibus tomorrow morning,\" Schumer said. \"We are very close, but we're not there yet.\" (Quigley and Weiss, 12/22) [ Politico: Senate Kicks Government Funding Drama Closer To Shutdown Deadline ](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/21/senators-spending-bill-amendments-00074999) Senators left the Capitol on Wednesday night without a critical deal allowing for votes on a $1.7 trillion government funding package, kicking the bill into Thursday and closer to a shutdown deadline. Lawmakers are at a standstill over a proposed GOP amendment tied to a Trump-era border policy, which could force Democrats to take a politically tricky vote. It's a U-turn from earlier in the day when leadership hoped the strong pull of leaving for the holidays would speed up passage of the mammoth bill on Wednesday, checking the final item off the Senate's year-end to-do list before the chamber departs Washington until late January.

The House GOP and a group of Senate Republicans wanted the full-year spending plan delayed until after they take control of the House on Jan. 3. Kevin McCarthy, who is trying to shore up support for his bid to become House speaker, backed a threat from a small group of conservatives vowing to block any initiatives next year from Republican senators who vote for the spending legislation, including Mitch McConnell. \"When I'm Speaker, their bills will be dead on arrival in the House if this nearly $2T monstrosity is allowed to move forward over our objections and the will of the American people,\" McCarthy tweeted.

In an 11th-hour attempt to deter Senate Republicans from voting in favor of the legislation, known as an omnibus bill, a group of 31 House Republicans sent a letter to their colleagues threatening to oppose the legislative priorities of any GOP senator who supported the package.\"Voting in favor of this bill is a dereliction of our duty on all counts,\" they warned.

Antiviral medications were released from the stockpile more than a decade ago during the H1N1, also known as swine flu, pandemic. Last week, the federal agency also announced it would allow states to dip into statewide stockpiles for Tamiflu, making millions of treatment courses available. Tamiflu can be prescribed to treat flu in people over the age of 2 weeks old.

When availability of oseltamivir or other antivirals is limited, antiviral treatment should be given to flu patients at the highest risk of severe disease, such as older adults, and those who are hospitalized, the CDC guidance states.

Two years ago, when Covid shots were first introduced, the federal government sent teams into thousands of nursing homes and community centers to vaccinate seniors, curbing the devastation of the virus. But so far this fall, the White House has only offered grants to community organizations to get shots into the arms of older people, without the clear messaging strategy or logistical support that they need most, many caregivers and nursing home executives said in interviews.

Remove any pillows or other soft bedding from a baby's crib, since they pose the risk of smothering or sudden infant death syndrome.
