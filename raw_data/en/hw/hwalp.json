Acupuncture and chiropractic are safe alternatives to drugs and surgery and can provide patients with natural pain relief, improved nervous system function and overall wellbeing. What is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is a practice that originated in China and can be traced back to over 2,500 years. Acupuncture focuses on an energy flow or life force called Qi which is essential for health and proper function of body systems. Disruption in this flow of energy is thought to be the cause behind many health issues and disease. The practice of acupuncture involves stimulating specific points on the body by inserting thin needles into the skin. By stimulating these specific points, acupuncture can help improve the flow of energy or Qi and help the body self-heal and reduce inflammation. Acupuncture has also been shown to increase the release endorphins leading tonatural pain relief and relaxation. How Do Acupuncture & Chiropractor Work Together? Acupuncture and chiropractic are both based on opening the pathways of energy flow in the body. Acupuncture focuses on the proper flow of Qi, while chiropractic focuses on the proper flow of nervous system communication form the brain to the body. When theses pathways of life force are open and not interfered with healing can begin. When these therapies are properly combined, chiropractic and acupuncture treatments can create balance in the body, boost natural healing, improve energy levels, and restore the body to its prior state of health.
