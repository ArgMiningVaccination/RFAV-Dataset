It compares favorably to antianxiety medication in the prevention of anxiety, even under stress, within one hour of taking a dose. It also enhances the production of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, and GABA, producing a state of well-being. It may also help to reduce blood pressure. 100 to 200 mg/day Lavender Deepens sleep, reduces anxiety. Scientific studies support the use of lavender for the relief of tension, whether used as a tea, herbal extract, or even inhaling the essential oil (aromatherapy). My preferred form for reducing anxiety and sleep disruption due to frequent waking is oral lavender oil. I've had patients who have successfully tapered off of long-term use of antianxiety medications after starting on just 60 mg of lavender oil (in capsules) daily. It can be taken before bed, or in the morning. It's shown equal effectiveness to antianxiety sleep medications such as benzodiazepines with none of the risks. It is also especially helpful for performance anxiety\u2014for example, regarding test taking. While at this dose, I do not have concerns about the very mild potential estrogen effects of lavender oil; don't use if you personally have had estrogen-receptor-positive cancer or are at high risk due to immediate family history (your mother or sister has had estrogen-receptorpositive cancer). Aromatherapy use acceptable in pregnancy. One lavender oil capsule (60 mg) before bed Magnesium Promotes relaxation, relieves anxiety and depression. Can be taken before bed to promote mental and muscular relaxation. Magnesium also helps if restless leg syndrome or muscle cramps keep you awake. 400 to 800 mg/day SOS Rx: Natural Support for Sleep, Mind, and Mood A V I V A R O M M .

Exciting research on the gut-brain connection has yielded a whole new field of study: psychobiotics\u2014looking at the use of probiotics to improve mood and cognitive function\u2014and studies are not disappointing. We now know that enhancing the presence of beneficial gut flora relieves anxiety, alleviates depression, reduces inflammatory cytokines, and reduces HPA axis overstimulation. Bifidobacterium infantis and B. longum are among the strains of probiotics that have been found to be particularly beneficial, leading to reductions in depression, irritability, and anxiety, and improving stresscoping abilities. 1 to 2 capsules/ day, with a minimum of 10 billion CFUs (colony forming units) daily Relora Sleep, anxiety, energy.
