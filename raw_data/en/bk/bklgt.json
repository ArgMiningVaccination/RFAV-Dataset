The best way to protect yourself and others from getting sick is by getting your annual flu vaccine, which is [now available at the University Health Center](https://health.unl.edu/flu). We know many have questions about the flu vaccine and wonder if it's right for them. Before you get vaccinated, take a moment to expand your knowledge of common flu symptoms, possible side effects, vaccine recommendations and more. Most common flu symptoms When we talk about [the flu](https://www.nebraskamed.com/primary-care/immediate-care/flu-shot-facts) (and the vaccine), we refer to the illness caused by the influenza virus. Influenza is a respiratory virus not to be confused with gastrointestinal bugs often called the \"stomach flu.\" The most common flu symptoms include: - Fever - Body aches - Fatigue - Upper respiratory symptoms that may include a cough, congestion or sore throat A person is considered contagious when symptoms are present. Still, they can potentially spread the flu even before they notice symptoms. Why vaccination is critical in 2022 As the COVID-19 pandemic transitions - especially as wearing masks and practicing social distancing are less utilized - there is a concern that the flu season will be more significant this year. Therefore, the University Health Center recommends getting vaccinated to protect yourself and our Husker community. Each year, flu vaccines are created based on predictions of what flu strains may be present in the coming flu season. Like most vaccines, the flu shot does not provide 100% protection, but it is still very effective. Receiving the vaccine reduces your chance of getting the flu, the severity of symptoms, and the risk of spreading the virus to others. Once you are vaccinated, you gain the total amount of protection after two weeks. Our recommendation is to get it sooner than later. What if I'm allergic to eggs? There is an egg-free vaccine available for those with an egg allergy, but it is not offered at the University Health Center. If your allergy is mild, you can safely receive the regular vaccine. If you have a severe allergy, talk to your doctor about receiving the egg-free version at an off-campus location. How does the flu vaccine work? The vaccine contains elements of the dead influenza virus so the immune system can respond to those specific proteins to make antibodies. When the immune system sees the virus in the future, it ramps up the antibody response to kill it quicker. What if I always seem to get sick after getting the flu shot? You cannot get the flu from the flu shot, but you may experience mild side effects. It's common to feel tenderness at the injection site or mild symptoms for a day or two afterward. When you experience mild symptoms, remember that your immune system is doing what it is designed to do: reacting to a foreign antigen and triggering the production of antibodies that will fight the flu in the future. Common side effects include: - General fatigue - Injection site pain - Occasionally, a low-grade fever Doctor's advice? Think about the timing of your flu shot. Plan it around your life events just in case you feel a few side effects afterward. Who shouldn't get the flu shot? Patients with a suppressed immune system should consult their doctor to discuss their best options. Those with a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome, certain autoimmune disorders and those who are sick should avoid getting the flu vaccine. How can I get my flu shot on campus? Flu shots are now available at the University Health Center. They are free for currently enrolled undergraduate and graduate UNL students. Students 18 and older may attend an upcoming drop-in flu vaccination clinic, and students of all ages can get vaccinated by appointment at the medical clinic by calling 402.472.5000.
