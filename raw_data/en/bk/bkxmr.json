As we move into the next decade of vaccines, the [Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030)](/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/strategies/ia2030) envisions a world where everyone, everywhere, at every age, fully benefits from vaccines to improve health and well-being. IA2030 is based on a conceptual framework of seven strategic priorities, with each strategic priority having defined goals and objectives and key areas of focus. To ensure that immunization fully contributes to stronger primary health care and attainment of universal health coverage, IA2030 recognizes life course and integration as important components. Effective integration between immunization and other health programmes can also contribute to increasing vaccination coverage by reducing Missed Opportunities for Vaccination (MOV). A MOV is defined as any visit to a health facility by a child (or adult) who is eligible for vaccination (unvaccinated, partially vaccinated or, not up-to-date, and free of contraindications to vaccination), which does not result in the person receiving all the vaccine doses for which he or she is eligible. This section includes examples of interventions that have been integrated in routine immunization services and during vaccination campaigns which will enable countries to make decisions about packages of interventions to be provided during immunization activities. HIV Testing Linking HIV testing with immunization services provides opportunities for early infant diagnosis of infected babies and to ensure that testing coincides with immunization.
