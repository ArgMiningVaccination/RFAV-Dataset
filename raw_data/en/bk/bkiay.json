Patients increasingly benefit from these therapies allowing them a lifestyle similar to healthy individuals, including travel to overseas destinations [1,2] . Travel destinations do not differ between patients on immunosuppressive therapy and other travellers , including trips to high-risk areas [2 -4]. Due to their immunosuppression, these patients are at higher risk to infectious diseases in term of infections, morbidity and mortality [5-9]. Consequently, immunisation is particularly important for this population . However, the administration of live vaccines, such as yellow fever vaccination (YFV) , to immunodeficient patients bears the risk of replication of the atten uated vaccine microorganism and clinically manifest infection [10-12]. Therefore, most interna tional guidelines state that live vaccines are contraindicated in patients on immunosuppression , leading to challenging conditions in every day consultations of this vulnerable group of patients [13-15]. Some national recommendations, such as the Finnish ones, allow live vaccinations on non-biological immunosuppression after careful risk/benefit assessment [16]. In Switzerland, the are mostly based on expert opinion, as data are scarce. These last few years, efforts were made to evaluate the safety of some live vaccines in selected and immunosuppressed individu als. In general, primary live vaccinations are potentially more da ngerous than secondary vaccinations as the immune system cannot build upon an exi sting immune memory to deal with the attenuated vaccine strain. In con trast, a secondary live vaccine is believed to be safer as an immune memory response can be activated a nd avert a systemic infection. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccinations have been n patients with juvenile rheumatic diseases . Patients were on treatment with classical disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as MTX and/or biological therapy with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) blocking agents or interleukin 1 (IL1) receptor antagonists and vaccinatio n was safe [21-23]. In a prospective study, 2/28 juvenile patients received a first -time MMR vaccination [24]. In one of them (therapy with MTX and corticosteroids) fever and a skin ra sh appeared 20 days post - vaccination. It was concluded that the rash was part of the disease activity rather than a side effect of vaccination [personal communication ]. Several studies reported on p rimary [25 -27] and secondary [28] MMR vaccination in stable patients after solid organ transplantation (SOT) . Only mild reactions were reported. Overall, studies in patients with autoi mmune diseases and after SOT on low immunosuppressive therapies have shown no severe adverse events . 5In some small studies, MMR vaccination was safely ad ministered to children with leukaemia [29,30] . However, in a study published in 1962, a 2-year seronegative old boy with leuk aemia on treatment with MTX (dosage not specified) was vaccinated against measles ; he developed a pneumonia and died [31]. Varicella In patients with rheumatic diseases on therapy with corticoster oids, DMARDs and/or TNF blockers, two prospective studies were performed with a first -time varicella vaccination without safety issues [32,33] . Varicella vaccination was administered to 17 patients after kidney transplantation on therapy with prednisone, cy closporine and azathioprine [34]. One patient developed a mild varicella rash. Several other smaller studies on varicella vaccination after SOT have been performed without any reported safety issues [26-28,35,36] . Most of the included patients had received a liver transplant; at the time of vaccination they had stable organ functions and were on low-dose immunosuppress ive therapy [37]. Yellow Fever vaccinat ion So far, two studies have been published, in which YF V was administered to 87 patients with rheumatic diseases on therapy with DMARDs (incl. MTX ) and biologicals [38,39] . No effects occurred, but all vaccinations were secondary vaccinations ; severe adverse events may not have emerged due to their rare frequency and the limited number of participants . In a retrospective study , 19 patients received YFV while on treatment with a variety of medications after SOT [40]. Although 17/19 vaccinations were primary YFV doses no important side effects were observed. In a cohort study, 19 patients on long-term low -dose or short -term high -dose corticosteroid treatment received a primary YFV; 15 were re -vaccinated. Apart from more local side effects, vaccination was safe [41]. Oral typhoid vaccination (OTV) OTV (Tya21) is believed to be safe. More than 400 million doses have been administered worldwide [personal communication ] and no single occurrence of a systemic infection has been reported d espite the administration to HIV patients [42]. However, data in patients with immunosuppressive agents are not available and is consequently contraindicated especially due to the ava ilability of an inactivated parenteral vaccine. In this study we aim to add to the p ublished scarce numbers on live vaccines in patients on immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy by Assess ing how many individuals rec eived live vaccine s while on immunosuppressive/ immunodulatory therapy in three of the largest Swiss Travel Clinics over a 5- 8-year time span 6 Estimating the number of vaccine reactions in this group Comparing reactions to live vaccines among travellers on therapy with immunosuppressive/immunodulatory medications to age -and sex matched healthy travellers who received the respective vaccination at a similar time point Rationale for study design A r etrospective design was chosen as live vaccinations are contraindicated on most immunos uppressive /immunomodulatory therapies and are only allowed after a care ful risk/benefit assessment. Thus, patients that fulfil the inclusion criteria are infrequent . A retrospective and multicent re study design was consequently chosen to increase the sample size . To overcome recall bias in the patient group we included a n age-and sex matched control group of travellers without immunosuppressive/immunodulatory therapy who received the respective live vaccine in the same time period. For some medications, it is well accepted that live vaccines may be given; one example is long-term low-dose corticosteroid therapy. However, \"low-dose\" is defined differently from country to country, the threshold is fore example 20mg prednisone or equivalent in the USA, Switzerland and Germany vs. 10mg in France and the United Kingdom [43]. In the Netherlands the decision on whether live vaccines may be given is based on the cumulative prednisone dose . MTX is another example. The thresholds have been mainly based on expert opinion and lac k solid data. For this reason, we decided to include also travellers vaccinated on low-dose corticosteroid therapy and other generally accepted medications. 7Methods Study location and time fr ame This retrospective study was conducted in three Travel Clinics in Switzerland: the Travel Clinic (Zentrum f\u00fcr Reisemedizin, ZRM) at the Epidemiology, Bi ostatistics and Prevention Ins titute, University of Zurich, the Travel Clinic of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) in Basel and the Travel Clinic at the University Hospitals of Geneva (HU G). Pre-travel data forms filled between 2010 and 2015 (ZRM and Swiss TPH, HUG: 2008 -2015) were live vaccinations a dministered during immunosuppressive /immunomodulating therapy. Ethics approval was obtained from the Zurich, Nordwestschweiz and Geneva Ethics co mmittee s (Reference Before the travel consultation, all individuals complet ed a form (electronic at ZRM, paper format at Swiss TPH and HUG ) including demographic information , details on the planned trip and data on their medical history including taken medications . Physicians verif ied the information during the consultation and added information on pre -existing medical conditions, used medications and prescribed vaccinations during the current consultation. As a first step, t hese forms were searched for all travel lers on immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory medications (search terms in Box 1). In Basel and Geneva the search was performed manually. In Zurich, several collected data variables were search ed electronically for the usage of an immunosuppressive/imunomodulatory medication . Among st travel lers detected by th is search, those who received a live vaccine ( MMR Zoster vaccine was not available in Switzerland during the time peri od and thus could not be looked at in this study. The identified patients were contacted by telephone and asked the questions from a pilot-tested questionnaire. If the patients could not be reached by telephone they were contacted by E -Mail. The questionnaire was developed with the input from several European vaccination and travel medicine experts during meeting s of the European Network for Tropical Medicine and Travel Health (TropN et) and consecutive post -meeting electronic correspondence . The following information was gathered : visit date, a ge, sex, types of received vaccination s, u nderlying condition(s) for immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatment , kind of immunosuppressive /immunomodulatory medication and dosage , time between th e last dose of immunosuppressant before vaccination , reactions after the vaccination in the graduation mild (not interfering in daily activities) , moderate (interfering with daily activities, but able to perform daily activities) a nd severe (not able to perform daily activities ), serious adverse reactions ( death, life -threatening, persistent or significant disability or 8incapacity, or prolongation of existing inpatient hospita lisation, congenital anomaly or birth defect, other important medical event or reaction ), actions taken due to vaccine reaction. While live vaccines are generally contraindicated un der immunosuppressive therapy , \"adequate\" time intervals (between cessation of an immunosuppressive medication and the administration of a live vaccine) have been defined after which the administration of a live va ccine is considered safe. These time interval s differ between medication s and depend on the drug's half-life and other factors . \"Adequate \" time interval mean s a sufficient interval time b etween drug interruption and live vaccine immuni sation, while the term \"critical\" time interval is used when a live vaccine was given before the \"adequate\" time interval had elapsed . L.G. Visser's publication \"The immunosuppressed Travel er\" was as reference to define \"adequate\" time intervals . If the respective medication was not mentioned in the publication, the \"adequate \" time interv als as defined by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) [18] were applied . In patients on corticosteroid s, we differentiated between short -term (<2 weeks) and long -term (2weeks) use . In the following sections of this paper the term immunosuppressive \" will include both immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory\" therapy. In Zurich and Basel, a healthy age and sex-matched control group was enrolled. For logistical reasons , in Geneva, the inclusion of controls was not feasible . Health y controls (HC) had to fulfil the following inclusion criteria: no immunosuppressive therapy , sex- and age -matched , same live vaccinat ion, the live vaccination was administered at the same time point (plus/minus six months) , HCs were contacted in the same way as patients. Comparative analyses were performed between immunosupp ressed patients in Basel/Zurich (BS/ZH immunosuppressed) vs. matched HCs. Statistical analysis Frequencies and percentages of categorical variables were compared using Chi -squared or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. Means, standard deviations (SD) , medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were reported and two -group comparisons were carried out using T -tests or Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney tests as appropriate. All analyses were performed anonymous ly using Stata 13.1 (Stata Corp. LP, Texas, USA). 9Results Across the three travel clinics , 197 travellers on immunosuppressive therapy received a live vaccine and 116 could be interviewed for the assessment of adverse reactions ( Figure 1 - flow chart ). Sixty non-immunosuppressed controls matched to the participants from the Basel and Zurich t ravel clinics were interviewed . Demographics Contacted immunosuppressed individuals were on a mean 45 .3 years (SD 15.9) old and 57 (49 .1%) were male. HCs had a comparable age (46.2 years, SD 15.4) and sex distribution (n=30 (50.8%) controls were male) to Basel/Zurich travel clinic patients (average 45.7 years, SD 15.4; 31 (51.7%) male. In the immunosuppressed patients the most common underlying diseases were rheumatic conditions (n=40, 34.5%) and inflammatory bowel diseases (n=33, 28 .4%, Table 1). Overall, 92 vaccinations against yellow fever, 21 aga inst MMR , four against varicella and six OTVs were given to patients on immunosuppression. None received a sole measles vaccination (Table 2). Controls received 48 YFVs, 14 MMR vaccinations, four OTVs and three varicella vaccinations. Percentages of participants who had previously received the respective administered live vaccination were comparable between immunosuppressed BS/ZH travell ers and controls for YFV, mumps and rubella vaccines (data not shown ). However 90.0% of controls had received a previous mea sles vaccinations compared to 41.7% of immunosuppressed BS/ZH patients (P=0.031) common medications participants were corticosteroids (n=45). In all immunosu ppressed travellers, the prednisone was 7.5mg/day on a me dian, and for 45mg a day, range: 5mg -840mg a day . Four patients (2 patients with 20mg/day, one 50mg/day and one with 80mg/day) with long-term therapy were above the \"permitted\" maximum of 20mg/day prednisone dose per day according to the Swiss vaccination recommendation s [18]. The second most frequent drug was mesalazine (n=28) 10 -20mg) wo patients treated with weekly MTX -dosages above 20mg, one with 22.5mg and one with 100mg. In the patient with a weekly dosage of 100mg, the last MTX - intake was 4 days before re -vaccination against yellow fever. The other patient had received YFV outside the \"critical \" time interval . Live vaccines were also given on biological therapies, such as TNF -alpha inhibitors (n= 8 travellers , Table 2). 10All but five patients were on current immunosuppressive therapy (or in \"critical time interval\" after cessation/pausing of an immunosuppressive medication) . In five travellers , adequate time intervals had elapsed since the last treatment dose was taken: One patient who received an MMR vaccine had taken the last MTX dose of 20mg 42 days before vaccination, two o ther individual s on MTX (20 -25mg and 5mg/week ) received the YFV 91 and 106 days after the last dose was taken, another patient on ustekinumab received a YFV 143 days after the last dose ; and one patient on 75mg 6 -mercaptopurine therapy took the last dose 135 days before YFV. In BS/ZH immunosuppressed , on average , 0.6 (SD 0.7) inactivated vaccines were given at the time of live vaccine administration. In HCs, on average 0.9 (SD 1.0) inactivated vaccines were simultaneously administered (P=0. 14). Safety assessment Overall, 22/116 (19.0%) of patients on immunosuppressive therapy reported reactions after the vaccination (Figure 2). Nine (7.8 %) remembered local reactions, such as muscle pain o r tension . Seven reactions were rated as mild; one patient with multiple sclerosis on interferon beta treatment reported a severe local reaction after a primary MMR vaccination. 14/116 (12.2%) patients had systemic reactions: six (5.2%) had mild muscle and joint pain , four (3.5%) had flu -like symptoms, one of them with painful lymph node s and nausea ; two (1.7%) remembered fatigue , and one reported (0.9%) fever . Out of the systemic reactions, 11 were mild, two were moderate and one person with rheumatoid arthritis on treatment with sulfasalazine remembered severe muscle/joint pain a primary YFV . Among HCs vaccination. 7/60 ( 11.7%) reported local reactions, such as muscle pain, h aematoma or sensitive puncture. All local reactions were mild. 8/60 (13.3%) HCs reported systemic side reactions; three (5.0%) remembered fatigue , one of them with fever. Two had (3.3%) flu -like symptoms and 4 (6.7%) had muscle/joint pain after the vaccination. Five systemic reactions were categorised as mild and two as moderate. There was no significant difference in percentages of local reactions and systemic reactions between controls and BS/ZH immunosuppressed (both P values=1.0) . Likewise, severity of local and systemic reactions was comparable between the immunosuppressed and HCs. However, none of the HCs reported a severe reaction. No serious adverse event was reported. 11In the five patients with \"adequate time\" intervals between cessation of immunosuppressive treatment and live vaccination, only one noticed mild muscle/joint pain. None of the five patients vaccinated in the \"critical\" time interval receiving long -term (2weeks had side effects. 12Discussion We conducted a retrospective study in immunosuppress ed travellers who received a live vaccination in three Swiss Travel Centres. We identified 197 patients on immunosuppression who were vaccinated against YF, MMR, varicella or typhoid and 116 could be interviewed for assessment of experienced side effects. No serious reaction was reported. Local and systemic reactions occurred as frequently in a matched HC group (25.0 %) as in the immunosuppressed (19.0%). Serious reactions due to live vaccines are extremely rare. It is estimated that a YEL -AVD (yellow fever vaccine -associated viscerotropic disease) occurs in 0.4 of 100.000 administered vaccine doses, with 1.0 per 100.000 doses in the >60 -year olds and 2.3 per 100.000 administered doses in individuals aged 70 [45]. Thus our sample was too small to detect a severe case , particularly on a specific immunosuppressive regimen and vaccine , as immunosuppressive regimens were diverse . Moreover, a ccording to the Swiss vaccination recommendations in patients with rheumatic diseases live vaccines are allowed on long -term (2weeks) ( 20mg/day prednisone equivalent/day) is usually permitted but some some experts will still wait two weeks or more before administering live vaccines [46]. As previously stated, because recommendations have been mainly based on expert opinion and lack solid data , we decided to include also travellers vaccinated on low -dose corticosteroid therapy and other generally accepted medications . 65.5% of all patients observed in our study might be considered to be on a weak immunosuppressive regimen (including budesonid, gl atiramer acetate, interferon, short -term high-dose-corticosteroid treatment ). No difference b etween high or weak immunosuppressive regimen was observed with regard to percentages of side effects , local reactions , systemic reactions and severity [data not shown] . Another limitation is the rapidly increasing diversity of immunos uppressive therapies , with the consequence that our study cannot be generalised to new medications . However, as severe reactions after live vaccinations may occur more often in the immunocomprom ised, the paucity of data on this topic makes us believe that even small sample size studies are important to be known by pract itioners in travel medicine . Due to the retrospective study design, l ive vaccines were administered between 14 days and five years prior to the conducted interviews. Thus reduced r ecall on experienced vaccine reactions may have limit ed the obtained results. However, we believe that severe and serious reactions would have been recalled even after a five -year time span. We additionally tried to limit recall bias by contacting age- and sex -matched HCs who had received the same vaccine during a similar t ime period . However, w e cannot exclude that recall may differ in those with a pre -existin g condition as they might have been more alert of vaccine reaction s than healthy individuals. 13Furthermore, it i s possible that some vaccinees had very serious reactions, which may eve n have led to death, and thus could not be reach ed for an interview. Neve rtheless , the safety division of Swissmedic has not detected a severe infection with a vaccine strain in an im munosuppressed patient between 2001 and May 2016 [personal communication]. On the other hand, the study can give some cautious data on effectiveness . No yellow fever case was reported in the Swiss population during the relevant ti me span, so we can be rather sure that none of the vaccinees was diagnosed with yellow fever. Ho wever, among measles cases reported in Switzerland, we do not know how many occur red in (vaccinated) immunosuppressed persons. Conclusion The decision on whether live vaccines can be given t o immunosuppressed patients is a daily encountered challenge by specialists of varying backgrounds. In immunosuppressed patients , live- attenuated vaccines can potentially be harm ful if the vaccine strain reverts to the original pathogen and infects the vaccinated person. On the other hand these patients profit espe cially from these vaccinations as they are particularly vulnerable to vaccine -preventable infections [47-49]. Apart from infecting the immunosuppressed person, other vaccine -related local or systemic reactions are feared as well as re -activation of the underlying disease. By making our data on live vaccinations in immunosuppressed patients available to a wide audience our aim is to contribute to the currently scarce literature on this topic . From the se additiona l data it is impossible to conclude that live vaccines can be safely given to immunosuppressed patients . However, despite the limitations discussed above it is re -assuring that in the examined patient groups serious side effects or infections by the attenu ated vaccine strain did not occur.
