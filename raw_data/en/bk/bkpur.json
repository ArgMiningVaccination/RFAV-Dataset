Emory University's Office of Information Technology (OIT, formerly LITS) is Emory University's central Information Technology department, supporting all missions of research, healthcare, education, and administration. OIT consists of professional information technology employees and manages all technical infrastructure (networking, data centers, service centers, etc.), information security infrastructure, enterprise-wide applications, healthcare delivery systems, and enterprise research platforms. Research IT Environment Emory University operates a high-speed, research information technology infrastructure to support the research mission of the University. With a high speed ten gigabyte fiber as its backbone, the network provides speeds of up to a gigabyte to the desktop and ten gigabytes throughout the internal campus with several points of redundancy through to the commodity Internet and Internet 2. Physical servers and hardware are stored in a 24x7 monitored professional data center with environmental and physical controls in place. The University hosts a virtual server farm and petabytes of storage that can quickly be provisioned based on investigator needs. From a security perspective, Emory University adopts a defense-in-depth strategy incorporating security and privacy controls at a policy, operating system, network device, and intrusion prevention systems. The University has HIPAA compliant network zones and infrastructure in place and implements encryption mechanisms to secure sensitive data at rest and in transit. In recent years, Emory has developed a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and built AWS at Emory - a customized environment and service to offer cloud computing and storage resources for a variety of research and teaching use cases. AWS at Emory provides investigators with access to many of the key research computing services offered by AWS and provides additional security and technical controls to help ensure the data are protected from unauthorized use. Within this environment, investigators and their team are able to take advantage of the scalability and elasticity of the cloud while leveraging best practices in cloud computing. Some highlights of the service include: In addition to these Emory-specific customizations, Emory research teams benefit from: (a) Amazon's elasticity, providing investigators with the opportunity to scale up or scale down their infrastructure based on needs. As such, the team is not paying for unused or idle infrastructure; (b) ability to tap into Amazon's technology optimized for specific research workloads, such as high memory computing cores and high speed solid state drives (SSD); and (c) quickly spin up computing resources within minutes to increase the time for investigators and their team to conduct their science. In support of this service, Emory has dedicated technical resources to help researchers and their teams. Emory has purchased AWS Enterprise support to provide 24x7 support for the service, and is also sponsoring training and leading a cloud community of practice, which includes participation from investigators, IT organizations, and scientific cores. Research Data Systems and Applications Data systems and applications used for research purposes can be hosted and administered on Emory OIT servers, either physically or through Virtual Machine environments. Emory OIT implements best practices in application management and support, such as maintaining application, database and web interface components on separate servers, establishing backup / fail over server redundancy for service continuity and system and data recovery, and maintaining distinct development, test and production environments for efficient application testing, upgrade and deployment. Access to systems in the Emory network zone is supported by secure VPN connection and remote access tools, and by state-of-the-art technology for identity management and authentication, and account credentials encryption. Role-based permission controls ensure that users have appropriate access to the designated functions and data records in applications and underlying databases, including row-level partitioning when necessary. Emory OIT applies regular functionality and security software, hardware and operating system patching and upgrades, according to existing policies and program-specific service-level agreements. A variety of Enterprise applications and services are supported by Emory OIT to enhance the research experience and allow teams to capture, analyze and disseminate data in a reliable and secure way. Examples include: the REDCap data capture system, the Emory Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), the OpenSpecimen biobanking application, the Tableau data visualization application, the Salesforce customer relationship management platform, the DocuSign electronic signature application, and more. In partnership with Emory's Biomedical Informatics department and in support of the Georgia Clinical and Translational Sciences Alliance, Emory OIT operates an instance of the i2b2 platform and an installation of the TriNetX system - both sourced from de-identified and aggregated Emory Healthcare electronic health record data for prospective patient cohort discovery that fit certain eligibility criteria. Research applications that make use of patient health information are not directly connected to the electronic medical record system. Instead, applications may draw on data extracted from the Emory clinical data warehouse read-only environment maintained by Emory Healthcare Information Systems, or on data abstracted from data instruments and entered in research applications and databases maintained by Emory OIT, such as the REDCap data capture system, the Emory Laboratory Information Management System and OpenSpecimen biobanking application, and program-specific data repositories. The release of health record data for a research study necessitates approval from the relevant Institutional Review Board, Research Oversight Committee and Healthcare Medical Records instances. When required for a particular study, data de-identification and date-shifting processes are applied to datasets in compliance with removing HIPAA identifiers before their transfer to investigators or partner institutions, as specified in data use, sharing and transfer agreements. Any OIT-hosted application is approved for deployment by an Architecture review committee and a Security review committee, which assess the soundness and detailed integration of the application within the Emory infrastructure, including its ability to meet HIPAA regulations with minimum risk, as documented in a HIPAA risk assessment and risk remediation plan. In addition to being hosted on Emory HIPAA-compliant servers, data systems and applications are provisioned to a list of pre-authorized users associated to a study IRB protocol, with specific privileges regarding access to functionality and particular data records. Additional administrative super-user accounts are granted to the application and / or the underlying database to perform application configuration, maintenance, troubleshooting and other user support tasks, as necessary. Any OIT personnel accessing sensitive data is required to be CITI and HIPAA certified and operates under an Honest Broker protocol.

FACILITIES AND RESOURCES Updated 22 June 2022 Fields Relevant for the Emory Gnotobiotic Animal Core (EGAC) [EMORY MICROBIOME CORE FACILITIES] The Emory Integrated Core Facilities (EICF) support microbiome studies by synergizing the skills and resources of three core facilities, namely The Emory Gnotobiotic Animal Core (EGAC), The Emory Integrated Genomics Core (EIGC), and The Emory Integrated Computational Core (EICC). Workflows have been optimized between the three cores to form a pipeline whereby gnotobiotic studies are undertaken within the EGAC, sequencing of microbiome 16S rDNA from gnotobiotic studies undertaken by the EIGC, followed by expert analysis of the generated sequence data and characterization of the microbial alpha and beta diversities undertaken by the EICC. EMORY GNOTOBIOTIC ANIMAL CORE (EGAC) Introduction: The Emory Gnotobiotic Animal Core (EGAC), one of the [Emory Integrated Core Facilities (EICF), is located in the five-story, 200,000-square-foot Health Sciences Research Building (HSRB), situated in rooms next to the Specific Pathogen Free (MPF) murine housing, as well as the Transgenic Mouse and Gene Targeting Core. The facility contains sixteen 3' foot wide rigid isolators (Parkbio), each with the capacity to house 12 mice cages each. Each cage has a maximum capacity of 5 mice per cage. Class II biological cabinets are available to investigators for experimental use.] Animal welfare: The facility has a dedicated technician to monitor murine health. The facility is run under Emory University's IACUC approved Standard Operating Procedures which oversees and certifies that care and use of the animals is ethical and humane. The IACUC oversight is implemented by an ongoing review and approval of the facility by way of written animal use protocols submitted for review by IACUC committee members. In addition, a semiannual inspection of all areas where animals are housed or undergo procedures is undertaken within the facility. Federal regulations, veterinary standards of care, campus policies, and facility standard operating procedures are used by the IACUCs in their evaluations of animal use. Microbiological Testing: We employ rigorous microbiological testing of all autoclaved material entering the isolators, including the food, water and bedding. We also regularly monitor germ-free mice within isolators and periodic control necropsies. Our tests include 1) real time quantitative PCR amplification of the V4 region 16S rRNA gene, 2) plating of fecal samples on BBL Brain Heart infusion with 10% Sheep Blood plates (nonselective controls for all strains) and incubation at 37\u00baC for 7 days, 3) Incubation in Thioglycollate medium with indicator, a medium used for the isolation and cultivation of aerobes, anaerobes and microaerophiles that are not excessively fastidious, and 4) Gram stain, which is a general visual examination for the presence of bacteria, and distinguishes between Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Gnotobiotic colonization: For colonization studies, 5-week-old germ-free mice are be inoculated with a either 1) a single microbe (mono-colonization) with a single bacterium), or 2) a defined finite group of microbes such as altered Schaedler flora (ASF) is a community of eight bacterial species: two Lactobacilli, one Bacteroides, one spiral bacteria of the Flexistipes genus, and four extremely oxygen sensitive (EOS) Fusobacterium species. The bacteria are selected for their dominance and persistence in the normal microflora of mice, and for their ability to be isolated and grown in laboratory settings. Germ-free animals, mainly mice, are infected with ASF for the purpose of studying the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The standardized microbial cocktail enabled the controlled study of microbe and host interactions, role of microbes, pathogen effects, and intestinal immunity and disease association. Also, compared to germfree animals, ASF mice have fully developed immune system, resistance to opportunistic pathogens, and normal GI function and health, and are a great representation of normal mice, or 3) a polymicrobial population sourced from another mouse or a human clinical sample, for example a humans or animals that has been treated with an antibiotic which may be used to establish whether it is the altered microflora diversity that triggers changes in organismal physiology. Microbes may be introduced directly into the stomach with a 24-gauge ball-tipped gavage needle, or because mice are coprophagic, polymicrobial microbiome transfer from mouse to mouse may be done by introducing fecal pellets into the recipient cage. Routine microbiological testing to establish that the desired microbiome diversity is maintained throughout the experiment is done collecting stool samples, purification of DNA from the samples, and PCR amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from the sample. The PCR product are then sequenced and output files processed using the QIIME and MOTHUR pipelines. In addition, to gnotobiotic isolation within isolators, the facility will be equipped with the Tecniplast ISOcage system allowing gnotobiotic isolation at 36 single cage level, enabling multiple studies on the same rack. ISOcage Tecniplast Bioexclusion System: Precise modulation of the microbiome is increasingly been appreciated as feasible approach to positively impact health and disease. However, heterogeneity of the microbiome between murine colonies housed in various facilities nationwide represent a tangible challenge to scientific rigor and reproducibility. Indeed, incongruent results have been observed between facilities when mice of the same phenotype were subjected to the same assays. We have developed a facility to directly control for microbiome heterogeneity by, where feasible, undertaking our assays in mice gnotobiotically colonized them with a defined flora. We undertake this by housing our mice in within our cutting edge Tecniplast ISOcageP Bioexclusion system. These are airtight individual mouse cages with high positive pressure that are specifically designed for germ-free, gnotobiotic and bioexclusion studies. The ISO cage system is the latest design for gontobiotics and germ-free animals because it allows researchers to undertake up to 36 simultaneous gnotobiotic studies, compared to only one study at a time in conventional multi-cage gnotobiotic isolators. For gnotobiotic experiments, mice can be initially raised under germ-free conditions. After weaning (3 weeks) mice will be transferred to an ISOcage cage. For experiments with a fully characterized controlled microbiome background, mice may be gnotobiotically colonized with Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF). ASF is a standardized microbial blend of eight bacteria, which allows for the exquisitely meticulous studies in a fully defined microbiome background. Importantly, compared to germ-free animals, ASF-associated mice have normally developed immune system, they have resistance to opportunistic pathogens, and normal gastrointestinal health. They are thus an excellent representative model of normal mice with a defined microbiome. ASF colonization is done by the initial purchase of fecal pellets containing ASF from Taconic Biosciences Inc., which is a commercial supplier of gnotobiotic animals and materials. For probiotics supplementation experiments, ASF colonized mice are fed twice a week and housed in the Tecniplast ISOcageP Bioexclusion system. By this method we can achieve complete scientific reproducibility by undertaking our experiments with a defined background microbiome. For experiments in this proposal, we will undertake fecal microbiome transplant experiments by isolating the samples from the luminal content od humans. It is imperative that following transplantation, the mice be maintained in bioexclusion conditions using the Tecniplast ISOcageP Bioexclusion system for the duration of the experiment (up to 8-weeks). This approach will eliminate the possibility of any further microbial components entering the transplanted microbiome. Murine strains bred and held within the facility: The facility currently has two large breeding colonies to maintain strains of C57BL/6J. Transferring new strains into the facility: Currently, we accept rederived germ-free mice from approved vendors, such as (but not limited to) Taconic Biosciences and The National Gnotobiotic Animal Resource Center at UNC. Mice must be shipped in approved transporters. Mice are transferred into newly set up isolators, and kept as the only genotype in said isolator for 4 weeks, and monitored weekly for germ-free status. Dedicated gnotobiotic barrier access suite: For this proposal, we will undertake bone fracture studies in germ-free and gnotobiotic conditions. GF and gnotobiotic mice used in manipulations will be housed within our cutting edge Tecniplast ISOcageP Bioexclusion system. GF and gnotobiotic mice will be transferred within the hermetically sealed ISO cage to a dedicated axenic Biological Safety Cabinet where fracture procedures will be undertaken.

This research proposes to utilize AWS at Emory, which is an Emory customized implementation of the Amazon Web Services computing infrastructure. AWS at Emory provides investigators with access to many of the key research computing services offered by AWS and provides additional security and technical controls to help ensure the data are protected from unauthorized use. Within this environment, investigators and their team are able to take advantage of the scalability and elasticity of the cloud while leveraging best practices in cloud computing. Some highlights of the service include: In addition to these Emory-specific customizations, the Emory research team benefits from: (a) Amazon's elasticity, providing investigators with the opportunity to scale up or scale down their infrastructure based on needs. As such, the team is not paying for unused or idle infrastructure; (b) ability to tap into Amazon's technology optimized for specific research workloads, such as high memory computing cores and high speed solid state drives (SSD); and (c) quickly spin up computing resources within minutes to increase the time for investigators and their team to conduct their science. In support of this service, Emory has dedicated technical resources to help researchers and their teams. Emory has purchased AWS Enterprise support to provide 24x7 support for the service, and is also sponsoring training and leading a cloud community of practice, which includes participation from investigators, IT organizations, and scientific cores. To help investigators utilize AWS, Emory IT offers free consultation on designs and cost estimations.

The Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Clinical Research Staff Support Model was developed more than 15 years ago to provide the research operational needs for Principal Investigators conducting research within Children's. The core of highly qualified and trained clinical research coordinators, nurses, assistants, and interns are managed by 5 Clinical Research Managers located on each campus: Egleston, Scottish Rite/Hughes Spalding, Center for Advanced Pediatrics, Marcus Autism Center, and within our AFLAC Cancer Center's CRO. These managers oversee a team of more than 100 clinical research professionals who partner with more than 150 Principal Investigators across our many subspecialties. While several have set study teams, there is also opportunity for Investigators to utilize the experienced pool of research coordinators on an as-needed basis. To facilitate acute access to research staff, Children's implemented an expedited position approval process for extramurally funded positions in 2019. Research projects can be serviced immediately by clinical research campus managers while permanent staff is hired and onboarded, if needed. Research staff are specifically trained by the Children's Clinical Research Department's dedicated Research Educator in collaboration with their campus Manager to conduct all research activities according to federal regulations, institutional policies and procedures, and ICH/GCP guidelines. Study specific training is completed by sponsor resources or the Principal Investigator and documented accordingly in the study's education log. Clinical Research Support Training and Development: Children's Clinical Research Department provides consistent, cross-campus onboarding, training, and on-going development to all our clinical research staff. Research relevant training and career development activities include but not limited to: \u00b7 For Emory-IRB approved studies: Mandatory, live--\"Introduction to Clinical Research at Emory for Coordinators and Nurses\". \u00b7 Mandatory Children's computer-based training--\"Children's Research Process Training\" completed at hire and annually. \u00b7 Completion of Children's Research Department's Orientation Checklist within 90 days of hire with Manager confirmation signature. \u00b7 CITI Program human subject's protection training every 3 years, including GCP. \u00b7 Mandatory in-person Children's Research Administration Orientation within first month of hire.

Additionally, helpful tools such as study start-up, close-out, and project transfer checklists, forms and templates for regulatory documents, and past research training sessions and webinars are also posted for easy access. The Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Clinical Research Staff Support Model Children's Healthcare of Atlanta employs a full time Research Educator who works specifically with the clinical research staff. The educator collaborates with our institutional partners at Emory University and others to plan, develop, train, and implement research priorities across the enterprise. All research staff working on Emory IRB approved projects are required to complete a live course- \"Introduction to Clinical Research at Emory for Coordinators and Nurses\". This course is designed to provide a basic framework of the roles and responsibilities for clinical research staff to highlight the tools to needed to successfully perform their job. The course introduces the new and existing clinical research staff to the federal regulations governing the conduct of clinical research including relevant institutional policies and procedures. The course also provides an integrated and practical overview of the operational procedures to facilitate compliance in clinical research. Employees are also required to complete the online training titled \"Children's Research Process Training\" at hire and annually. This course is divided into three segments; Study Start-up, Study Conduct, and Study Closeout, and is designed to educate the research coordinator or nurse about the entire life cycle of a research project at Children's. In addition, Children's hosts quarterly staff meetings. These meetings cover a wide array of topics and are frequently used to introduce significant changes to policies/procedures, roll out new system initiatives, introduce changes to processes or federal and regulatory rules. New Children's employees are required to attend an in-person Research Administration Orientation (RAO) within the first month of employment. During the RAO, representatives from the IRB, Research Compliance, and Research Finance discuss their specific areas and how they will interface with the coordinator or nurse. Research specific SOP's are also reviewed during the RAO. Children's policies, SOP's and guidelines are housed on our internal website, Careforce Connection, and can be accessed by all Children's staff or those with sponsored accounts from other institutions. Individualized coordinator/nurse training with the Research Educator is available as well. Mock consent training is the most commonly used service provided by the educator; however, other ad hoc training is also available. The educator partners with the research compliance team to address items identified by their audit program and ensure proper adherence to federal regulations, institutional policies and procedures, and ICH/GCP guidelines. Children's research managers also complete an orientation checklist with each employee to verify mastery of key concepts related to their role as a research coordinator or nurse. We believe that continuing education beyond what is offered here at Children's is important and provide funds for four staff members per year to attend national conferences via a scholarship program. Our primary focus is on the conferences hosted by the two main research professional associations (Association of Clinical Research Professionals and The Society of Clinical Research Associates), but other conference attendance is supported as well. Children's and Emory partner to host a monthly meeting that covers a variety of research topics from federal regulations to specific operational issues. The sessions are teleconferenced to reach a broader audience. Lastly, Children's requires human subjects' protection training every three years via the CITI program. The CITI GCP module is required every three years for federally funded studies but is recommended as best practice regardless of the funding source. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta employs a full time Research Educator who works specifically with the clinical research staff. The educator collaborates with our institutional partners at Emory University a...

The over-riding mission of the Office of Nursing Research (ONR) is to facilitate faculty and students in the generation, dissemination, and application of knowledge as it relates to nursing care of individuals and families across the lifespan and around the globe. To this end, the Dean of the School of Nursing has invested significantly in the ONR. The ONR includes the Associate Dean for Research Operations (Drenna Waldrop, PhD); the Director of the Biostatistics and Data Management Core (Melinda Higgins, Ph.D); 3 FTE Methodology/Statistical Experts; a Data Manager; a Biobehavioral Lab Director Coordinator; and a full-time Project Manager. Each of these individuals works to foster a climate of research facilitation and productivity. Multiple resources are provided by the ONR. Briefly, as soon as a faculty member or student alerts the ONR that he or she intends to submit a proposal, an electronic notification is sent to the Associate Dean for Research, and the Senior Research Program Coordinator. The Pre-Award Specialist, the Grant Editor, and the Statistical Team follow-up with the individual to begin discussions around the budget, to provide early methodological consultation, and to schedule an in-house, Mock NIH Review. These personalized contacts remain active until the proposal is submitted. When a proposal is awarded, the Post-Award specialist assists the faculty member or student to manage the award effectively by preparing monthly reports and reviewing them in regularly scheduled in-person discussions, In addition to assisting faculty in grant submissions and management, publishing resources and manuscript editorial support is also offered through the ONR. Monthly series of research roundtables and colloquia provides additional opportunities for interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration. In addition, the statistical team holds regular statistical workshops each semester, well attended by students and faculty alike. To coordinate all interactions, the offices of the ONR team are grouped in a complex on the second floor of the Nursing School. The research efforts of the faculty and students in the School of Nursing address a variety of contemporary clinical and health policy questions. Pertinent areas of inquiry include symptom management in acute and chronic illness such as Cancer and Heart Failure and the impact and etiology of interacting symptoms - such as cognitive dysfunction, depression, sleep disruption, pain and stress - on symptom expression and management. Faculty scholarship includes work focused on improving health outcomes and self-management in a variety of conditions (e.g., HIV/AIDs, diabetes, maternal and child health, and PTSD). Work is also ongoing regarding the role of family, community, and spirituality in the support of persons faced with a variety of chronic illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, and the influence of the microbiome on pregnancy outcomes and maternal health. Consistent with strategic themes in the school and across the university, a number of faculty members are engaged in international research, much of it focused on issues of maternal and newborn infant mortality. Almost all of these research examples, conducted by faculty members from the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, are interdisciplinary in nature. The success of the School's researchers is evidenced by our active research program of extramurally funded awards, currently totaling nearly $20 million, of which nearly $10.5M is comprised of NIH funding, resulting in the School of Nursing's consistent ranking in the top five of NIH funded nursing schools in the last three years.

Motion Capture Lab: The motion capture room measures 19 x 32 ft with a 9-foot ceiling. The capture area measures 10 x 15 ft. The motion capture system is from Motion Analysis Corporation and includes 14 Osprey cameras with a resolution of 640 x 480. These cameras capture data at a rate of 120 frames per second. Eight are located near the ceiling and the remaining six are at waist height. The software is the latest version of Motion Analysis' Cortex software version 7.2.6.1828. There are two computer stations within the lab for data collection and analysis. Overlapping fields of view of the IR-DVCs define the 150 m\u00b3 capture space. The motion capture system is capable of triangulating and recording, in real-time, the instantaneous 3-D coordinates of each IR reflective spatial marker attached to the subject's skin or clothing prior to motor testing. We use an array of 60 of these spatial markers applied to a standardized set of bony landmarks (augmented Helen Hayes Full Body Marker Set). Each marker is an IR-reflective sphere with a diameter of either 12 mm for upper body placements or 19 mm for placements on the lower extremities. Each marker includes an attachment disk of comparable size. The markers are attached to the subject with medical-grade, disposable, double-stick adhesive disks. Marker coordinates are computed in real-time from the synchronized video recordings. Regardless of marker size, the motion capture system records the synchronous location of each marker's spatial centroid at 120 Hz (frames/s), with calibrated error of < 0.7 mm in all 3 dimensions. Each marker is identified and tracked in real-time by matching its relative location within the moving cloud of 60 markers to a topological template of the subject's own marker-clad body recorded immediately prior to motion testing.

Clinical Research Clinical Research in the Department of Neurology is designed to identify important patterns of brain function by studying patients with clinical disease and also studying healthy volunteers. The primary distinction between Clinical Research compared to Clinical Trials is that in Clinical Research, no treatment intervention is being formally investigated. Thus, rather than seeking to determine what is the best approach to managing and treat various neurologic diseases, Clinical Research addresses how neurologic diseases affect factors such as language, memory, or mood, characterizes the effects of treatment that is being received as part of the normal standard of clinical care, or may simply study disease progression over time-based. Many Clinical Research studies in the Department of Neurology involve imaging techniques such as MRI or PET. In addition, most patients being seen by Neurology faculty consent to allow their treatment records to be studied anonymously to uncover new patterns to improve clinical care. Basic Research Emory University has one of the most active neuroscience research communities in the US, with over 400 neuroscientists from different Emory departments contributing to a translational neuroscience continuum. Many neuroscience researchers are from the Department of Neurology, who not only are principal investigators on basic neuroscience research projects but who also play a critical role in the graduate training of future researchers through their active membership in the Emory Neuroscience program. There is great diversity in the basic research that is conducted in the Neurology Department, reflected in the Department's primary research locations in the Woodruff Memorial Research Building, Center for Neurodegenerative Disease/Whitehead Research Building, and Yerkes National Primate Research Center. Regardless of the specific types of research, they all share a common goal of advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms with the ultimate goal of translating research findings to clinical applications to significantly improve patient care.
