In fiscal years 2017 through 2021, NIH obligated $97 billion for basic research, $28 billion for clinical trials and related activities, and $9 billion for biomedical workforce training, as part of its investments in biomedical R&D. GAO found that , in fiscal years 2019 through 2022 , up to 16 to 18 percent of NIH - funded clinical trials were registered late in the public database ClinicalTrials.gov. The HHS Office of Inspector General reported in August 2022 that only about half of NIH -funded clinical trials submitted results on time to the database in calendar years 2019 and 2020 due to insufficient monitoring and enforcement by NIH. NIH generally requires an NIH -funded clinical trial to be registered within 21 days of enrolling the first participant and results to be reported within 1 year of the trial's completion. NIH officials stated the agency has been taking additional actions since October 2021 to add ress noncompliance with these requirements, including automated checks for noncompliance and the monitoring of noncompliance rates by analyzing ClinicalTrials.gov data. Timely reporting of information about NIH -funded clinical trials provides transparency of NIH's research to advance drug development. NIH awardees did not consistently disclose NIH support in patents arising from research funded by the agency. GAO found that about 2,700 of 19,055 patents with application dates in calendar years 2012 through 2021 did not fully or correctly disclose NIH support (see fig ure), as required. NIH does not provide clear guidance that its awardees should name NIH as the funding agency and correctly identify the award number when disclosing NIH support in patents. The disclosure of federal support informs the public and other interested parties of the federal government's involvement. When awardees do not disclose the agency's support correctly, or do not name NIH as the funding agency, these parties cannot link patents to NIH funding and determine the extent of the agency's involvement in developing the patented technologies, including drugs.

Wright at (202) 512 -6888 or WrightC@gao.gov .Why GAO Did This Study With a budget of $43 billion in fiscal year 2021, NIH funds multiple R&D activities that contribute to drug development. NIH -funded biomedical R&D generates basic scientific knowledge on biological mechanisms of various diseases, supports clinical trials investigating if drugs are safe and effective, and trains bi omedical scientists who go on to work at universities, in government, and industry. Although not all NIH -funded R&D is directly related to drug development, developing drugs and treatments is one of the agency's strategic goals. GAO was asked to review how NIH- funded biomedical R&D contributes to drug development. This report examines, among other things, (1) NIH funding for basic research, clinical trials, and biomedical workforce training; (2) reporting of information about NIH -funded clinical trials in t he public registry ClinicalTrials.gov; and (3) the extent to which NIH support is disclosed in patents arising from research funded by the agency. GAO reviewed relevant laws and agency documents, analyzed clinical trial and patent data, and interviewed NIH officials, grantees, and academic experts. What GAO Recommends GAO is making two recommendations to NIH, including that its guidance clarify that awardees should name NIH and include the NIH award number when disclosing the agency's support in patent appl ications. HHS concurred with the recommendations.Figure: Patents Disclosing Support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with Applicati on Dates in Calendar Years 2012 thr ough 2 021 Accessible Data for Figure: Patents Disclosing Support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with Applicati on Dates in Calendar Years 2012 thr ough 2 021 Patents disclosing NIH support Number of patents Percentage Patents include correct NIH award number16,352 85.8 Patents include incorrect NIH award number2,525 13.3 Patents do not include any award numbers178 0.9 Total 19,055 100.0 Page i GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchContents GAO Highlights ii Why GAO Did This Study ii What GAO Recommends ii What GAO Found ii Letter 1 Background 3 NIH Tracks and Publ icly Reports Funding by Grant or Project 13 NIH Did Not Ensure Timely Registration and Result Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov but Is Taking Steps to Improve Compliance 16 NIH Support Is Not Consistently Disclosed in Patents Arising from NIH-Funded Research 24 Microdata Allow Researchers to Better Under stand the Impact of NIH Funding, but NIH Does Not Have a Procedure for Them to Access These Data 31 Conclusions 40 Recommendations for Executive Action 41 Agency Comments 41 Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology 43 Appendi x II: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services 50 Accessible Text for Appendix II: Comments from the Department o f Health and Human Services 53 Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments 56 Tables Table 1: National Institutes of Health (NIH) Obligations for Select Biomedical Research and Development Activities, Fiscal Years 2017 through 2021 (in billions) 15 Table 2: Clinical Trials Funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on ClinicalTrials.gov, Including Trials Registered Late, in Fiscal Years 2019 through 2022 18 Table 3: Patents Likely Underreporting Support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with Application Dates in Calendar Years 2012 through 2021 28Page ii GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchFigures Figure 1: Federal Obligations for Research and Deve lopment in Fiscal Year 2020 6 Accessible Data for Figure 1: Federal Obligations for Research and Development in Fiscal Year 2020 6 Tracing Direct and Indirect Effects of National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants 11 Figure 2: Elements of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Award Number 25 Accessible Text for Figure 2: Elements of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Award Number 25 Figure 3: Patents Disclosing Support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with Application Dates in Calendar Years 2012 through 2021 26 Accessible Data for Figure 3: Patents Disclosing Support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with Application Dates in Calendar Years 2012 through 2021 26 Figure 4: Examples of User Input Errors for National Institutes of Health (NIH) Award Numbers in Patent Government Interest Statements 27 Accessible Text for Figure 4: Examples of User Input Errors for National Institutes of Health (NIH) Award Numbers in Patent Government Interest Statements 27 Abbreviations FDA Food and Drug Administration HHS Department of Health and Human Services HHS OIG Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General NIH National Institutes of Health NIH RePORT National Institutes of Health Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools NSF National Science Foundation R&D research and development UMETRICS Universities: Measuring the Impacts of Research on Innovation, Competitiveness, and Science USPTO United State s Patent and Trademark OfficePage iii GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchThis is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

Washington, DC 20548 Letter April 4, 2023 The Honorable Jamie Raskin Ranking Member Committee on Oversight and Accountability House of Representatives The Honorable Debbie Stabenow United States Senate With a budget of $43 billion in fiscal year 2021, National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds multiple research and development (R&D) activities that can lead to the development of new drugs or new uses for existing drugs.1A federal agency in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), NIH is the largest public funder of biomedical R&D in the United States. Although not all NIH -funded R&D is directly related to drug development, \"developing and optimizing treatments, interventions, and cures \" is one of NIH 's strategic goals.2 While the pharmace utical industry 's role in bringing drugs to market is easier to grasp, the extent of NIH contributions to drug development, which typically take place years before a drug is marketed, is not well understood or recognized. Access to data and data -driven ana lysis about NIH contributions can help the public understand how NIH investments in science and innovation translate into drugs that benefit Americans ' health. It can also provide policymakers with new evidence to make decisions related to biomedical innov ation and future R&D investments. Further, this information could be relevant to future drug pricing negotiations 1The term \"drug\" in this report generally includes small molecule drugs, biologics, in vivo diagnostic agents, and drug -device combination products approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While we refer to these products collectively as FDA -approved drugs, the y are generally reviewed and approved under different statutory and regulatory procedures. For example, small molecule drugs are reviewed under different procedures than biologics, which are a diverse category of products typically derived from living mate rial. 2National Institutes of Health, NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2021 -2025 .Letter Page 2 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchbetween HHS and drug manufacturers mandated by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.3 As discussed in our prior work, scientific discoveries ma de by NIH scientists contributed directly to the development of drugs, including cancer treatments and vaccines.4More broadly, NIH -funded biomedical R&D contributes to basic research investigating biological mechanisms of different diseases, clinical tria ls that study the safety and effectiveness of drug candidates and other biomedical or behavioral interventions, and training biomedical scientists who go on to work in federal labs, universities, hospitals, and the pharmaceutical industry. You asked us to review how NIH -funded biomedical R&D contributes to drug development. This report examines (1) NIH funding for basic research, clinical trials, and biomedical workforce training in fiscal years 2017 through 2021 and how that funding is tracked; (2) reporti ng of information about NIH -funded clinical trials in the public registry ClinicalTrials.gov maintained by NIH; (3) the extent to which NIH support is disclosed in patents arising from NIH -funded research; and (4) the extent to which microdata for NIH gran ts are accessible to researchers for tracing linkages between NIH contributions and drug development.5In addition to this report, we are publishing a patent dataset, which can be accessed on our website at https://www.gao.gov/products/gao -23-105656 . For all four objectives, we reviewed applicable laws and regulations, and NIH policies, procedures, and guidance. We obtained and analyzed data on NIH funding for biomedical R&D, NIH -funded clinical trials, and disclosure of NIH support in patents arising from NIH -funded research. We assessed the reliability of these data by re viewing related documentation and reviewing the data for errors, omissions, and outliers, among other things, and determined the data to be reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. We reviewed select academic 3As part of the Drug Price Negotiation Program, established under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, manufacturers of certain high -priced single source drugs will b e required to submit data to HHS regarding R&D costs and prior federal financial support.

We also interviewed officials and experts, including cognizant officials from the NIH Office of the Director and several NIH institutes and centers, scientists from several drug discovery centers , and researchers from several universities who have received NIH funding or studied NIH programs. We compared the agency 's efforts to inform NIH awardees of federal support disclosure requirements when applying for patents against Standards for Internal C ontrol in the Federal Government related to communicating quality information.6(See app. I for more details about our scope and methodology.) We conducted this performance audit from January 2022 to April 2023 in accordance with generally accepted governm ent auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtaine d provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Background Drug Development The development and approval of a new drug is a complex and costly process that can take 15 or more years and involve multiple public and private entities that fund and conduct R&D.7NIH and other federal agencies provide support for most aspects of scientific discovery and basic biomedical research relevant to drug development. The industry then advances those discoveries and early -stage technologies from the 6GAO, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government , GAO -14-704G (Washington, D.C.: September 2014). 7The cost of developing a new drug is a subject of debate. A study published in 2016 estimated the cost of developing a new drug at more than $2.5 billion; see J.A. DiMasi, H.G. i n the Pharmaceutical Industry: New Estimates of R&D Costs ,\" Journal of Health Economics , vol. 47 (2016). A more recent study estimated the cost at $1.3 billion; see O.J. Wouters, M. McKee, and J. Luyten, \"Estimated Research and Development Investment Neede d to Bring a New Medicine to Market, 2009 -2018, \" Journal of the American Medical Association , vol. 323, no. 9 (2020).Letter Page 4 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchlaboratory to a marketable drug. Typically, the drug development process consists of the following stages: \u00b7Basic research. Scientific investigation of the molecular, cellular, or biological mechanisms of a disease that lays the foun dation for the development of new drugs; \u00b7Drug discovery. Screening of thousands of compounds in the laboratory to identify promising candidates to treat the disease; \u00b7Preclinical research. Laboratory and animal testing to further narrow the list of compound s and answer basic questions about safety and proof of concept; \u00b7Clinical trials. Testing of the drug in human volunteers for safety and efficacy that is conducted in phases;8and \u00b7Review and approval. FDA conducts a regulatory review and approves the drug f or marketing and sales in the United States if it is found to be safe and effective for its intended use. However, in practice, the process is nonlinear, with some activities attributed to different stages of drug development taking place concurrently, and uncertain. Many new drug candidates fail to advance to the next stage or to gain FDA approval. Often, drug candidates and drugs that already have FDA approval are studied for new therapeutic uses. 8Clinical trials are usually conducted in phases that build on one another, though the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials generally test t he safety of a drug with a small group of healthy volunteers (usually fewer than 100) to determine the drug 's initial safety profile and find the highest dose of the new drug or treatment that can be given safely without causing severe side effects. If the drug does not show unacceptable toxicity in phase 1 clinical trials, phase 2 clinical trials are conducted in a larger group of volunteers (usually dozens to hundreds) to assess the drug 's safety and effectiveness for a particular disease or condition and determine common short -term side effects and risks. In phase 2 clinical trials, generally some volunteers receive the drug and others receive a control, such as a placebo. If there is evidence that the drug is effective in phase 2 clinical trials, phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to gather additional information on the drug 's safety and effectiveness in several thousand volunteers.Letter Page 5 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchBecause such work builds upon previous R&D efforts, new ca ndidate therapies could be ready for clinical trials more quickly.9 NIH and Federal R&D Funding As an agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance hea lth, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, NIH plays an essential role in funding related scientific activity in the United States. In the federal government, NIH is the second largest funder of R&D after the Department of Defense and provides about half of all federal funding for basic research.10In fiscal year 2020, NIH obligated $43 billion for R&D, including about $22 billion for basic research and $21 billion for applied research (fig. 1). 9As an example, the development of remdesivir \u2014a drug used to treat COVID -19\u2014 illustrates how drug development builds on pr ior biomedical R&D. Before the COVID -19 pandemic, remdesivir was a drug candidate originally invented to treat viral hepatitis and respiratory syncytial virus infection and later studied for its antiviral properties against multiple other viruses, includin g coronaviruses, in preclinical research and several clinical trials. As a result of those extensive multi -year R&D efforts, which involved federal support, the manufacturer of remdesivir was able to start a phase 3 clinical trial testing the drug's effica cy against COVID -19 in the early months of the pandemic, and remdesivir became the first drug approved by FDA to treat the disease. GAO, Biomedical Research: Information on Federal Contributions to Remdesivir , GAO -21-272 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 31, 2021). 10This report focuses on federal R&D funds obligated by federal agencies. The federal government also provides R&D support through the tax credit for increasing research activities and the orphan dr ug credit for companies to develop medications and treatments for rare diseases that affect small populations. The credits and assessment of their effectiveness are out of the scope of this report.Letter Page 6 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchFigure 1: Federal Obligations for Research and Deve lopment in Fiscal Year 2020 Accessible Data for Figure 1: Federal Obligations for Research and Deve lopment in Fiscal Year 2020 Agency Total R&D (in billions of dollars)Basic research (in billions of dollars)Applied research (in billions of dollars)Experimental development (in billions of dollars) DOD 66.70 Other 10.36 2.44 6.45 1.47 Letter Page 7 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchNote: Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts. Applied research is original investigation undertaken in o rder to acquire new knowledge and directed primarily towards a specific practical aim. Experimental development is creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes, or improving existing products or processes. NIH is the top public funder of biomedical R&D in the United States and the world. About 80 percent of the NIH budget funds its extramural program, which involves R&D performed at universities, me dical centers, hospitals, other research institutions, and companies. Although the majority of the extramural funding goes to academic institutions , NIH also directs funding to small businesses con ducting biomedical R&D. The agency is the second largest funder of the federal Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer p rograms established to strengthen the role of small business concerns in federal R&D.11R&D conducted at NIH itself \u2014the agency 's intramural program \u2014 receives 11 percent of the NIH budget. Both the extramural and intramural programs at NIH support basic research, clinical trials, and biomedical workforce training, among other activities. Consistent with its mission, NIH is the largest funder of basic biomedical research in the United States. While industry provides the majority of funding for clinical trials of drugs in the United States, NIH funded over 9,000 grants supporting clinical trials that tested drugs and other interventions in fiscal year 2021 , accordi ng to public NIH data . NIH is also the largest public funder of biomedical workforce training, which enhances the knowledge and research skills of scientists in biomedical disciplines at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. According to Na tional Science Foundation (NSF) da ta, 70 percent of federally funded graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in biomedical sciences received NIH funding in fiscal year 2020. 11Federal agencies with an extramural budget for research o r R&D in excess of $100 million are required to participate in the Small Business Innovation Research program, and those with such obligations of $1 billion or more are required to participate in the Small Business Technology Transfer program. In fiscal ye ar 2021, 11 federal agencies and their components that participated in one or both programs awarded nearly $3 billion, including $1.2 billion from NIH. See GAO, Small Business Research Programs: Reporting on Award Timeliness Could Be Enhanced , GAO -23-105591 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 12, 2022).Letter Page 8 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchNIH provides the vast majority of its extramural funding through multiple grant mechanisms.12An NIH grant can support multiple R&D activities, including basic research, clinical trials, and biomedical training. At the same time, NIH also has grants dedicated solely to clinical trials and biomedical training. Grant applications fo r NIH funding undergo a two -stage review. During the initial review, each application receives an overall score reflecting multiple review criteria.13The second review considers the application in the context of the goals and needs of NIH institutes and ce nters and makes recommendations concerning funding decisions.14The institute or center director makes final funding decisions. In fiscal year 2021, NIH institutes and centers provided 56,957 extramural grants to 2,696 institutions. Public Data about NIH Bi omedical R&D NIH publicly reports extensive information about NIH -funded biomedical R&D in its web -based database NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (NIH RePORT), which consists of several portals.15The RePORT Expenditures and Results (RePORTER) portal allows users to search a repository of NIH -funded research projects and access publications and patents resulting from NIH funding. NIH RePORTER draws information on publications from PubMed, a database of scientific publication abstracts, and on p atents from interagency Edison (iEdison), a federal database of inventions and patents arising from federally funded 12In fiscal year 2021, NIH distributed 90 percent of its extramural funding via grants and 10 percent via contracts. R01 and equivalent grants, which are desi gned to support discrete, specified, circumscribed research projects and can be 3 -5 years in length, accounted for about half of all extramural funding. 13The initial review is carried out by Scientific Review Groups, also known as study sections, which are composed primarily of nonfederal scientists who have expertise in relevant scientific disciplines and current research areas. Reviewers develop the overall impact score after assessing each application against multiple review criteria, including significa nce, investigator(s), innovation, approach, and environment. 14The second review is conducted by National Advisory Councils or Boards for NIH institutes or centers with the involve ment of NIH program staff. These bodies are composed of both scientific and public representatives chosen for their expertise, interest, or activity in matters related to health and disease. 15See https://report.nih.gov/ .Letter Page 9 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchresearch.16The Categorical Spending portal provides annual funding information for various research, condition, and disease categories base d on NIH grants, contracts, and other funding mechanisms. Another portal, the NIH Data Book, provides basic summary statistics on NIH grants and contracts, recipient organizations, and NIH -funded training, among other things. The data in NIH RePORT are gen erally a subset of NIH 's internal grant management database for the extramural program known as Information for Management, Planning, Analysis, and Coordination II (IMPAC II). ClinicalTrials.gov is a public, web -based re gistry and results database of U.S. and international clinical trials, includi ng NIH -funded trials, created in response to a statutory mandate and maintained by NIH 's National Library of Medicine.17Information on ClinicalTrials.gov is provided and updated by the party responsible for the cli nical trial.18Generally, the responsible party submits information about the trial to ClinicalTrials.gov (that is, registers the trial) when the trial begins, updates the information throughout the trial, and reports results after the trial ends. Under an NIH policy issued in 2016, the responsible party of a clinical trial funded in full or in part by NIH is generally required to register the trial no later than 21 16PubMed is a public database maintained by NIH 's National Library of Medicine, which contains more than 34 million citations for biomedical literature from life science journals and other sources. The iEdison database is a web -based nonpublic database des igned around the Bayh -Dole Act reporting requirements and used by several federal agencies. Recipients of federal research funding report \u2014and the funding agencies review \u2014 inventions and patents arising from the funded research in iEdison. The database was maintained by NIH until August 2022, when the National Institute of Standards and Technology took over the responsibility. 17See https://clinicaltrials.gov/ . NIH was directed by federal law to create a public data bank and registry of clinical trials, culminating in ClinicalTrials.gov, which opened to the public in 2000. The law stipulates that the data bank would share information on clinical trials for drugs for serious or life -threatening diseases and conditions with members of the public, health care providers, and researchers.

A patent is an exclusive right granted for a fixed period to an inventor.20An FDA - approved drug is typically associated with patents.21The Bayh -Dole Act of 1980 created a legal framework for ownership of patent rights arising from federally funded research and for disclosing federal support.22The act enabled universities, nonprofit research institutions, and businesses to own, patent, and commercialize inventions developed with federal funding. Contracts and awards subject to the requirements of the Bayh - Dole Act must contain a provision requiring contractors and awardees, who seek to patent inventions developed with federal funding, to include in the patent application a statement disclosing federal support (known as the government interest statement). The requirement provides transparency by informing intere sted parties of the federal government 's involvement, and that the government has certain rights in the invention. 19National Institutes of Health, \"NIH Policy on the Dissemination of NIH -Funded Clinical Trial Information\" (Sept. 21, 2016). The NIH policy, which covers NIH -funde d clinical trials, complements the federal regulations implementing the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.2 -11.64. Whereas the federal regulations apply to applicable clinical trials of FDA -regulated drug, biological, and device products in phase 2 and later phases, the NIH policy generally applies to all NIH -funded clinical trials regardless of the phase and the type of intervention tested in the trials. According to the NIH definition, clinical trial interventions inclu de small molecule drugs, biologics, medical devices, procedures, and behavioral treatments that are either investigational or already available. 20A patent grants the right to \"exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling \" the invention th roughout the United States or importing into the United States. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154(a)(1). This right can be assigned to other entities. 21If an inventor invents or discovers a new chemical compound, the inventor may seek a patent claiming the invention. An inv entor can also patent a group of distinct chemical compounds. Also patentable are drug formulations, methods of using a drug to treat a particular disease, methods and technologies to administer or manufacture a drug, as well as technologies that test for and diagnose diseases, if they meet certain patentability requirements. 22Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, Pub.

Researchers have analyzed patent government interest statement data to trace federal contributions to biomedical innovation and drug development. Studies of Federal Contributions to Drug Development Academ ic researchers have analyzed federal contributions to biomedical innovation and drug development.23The primary output of NIH -funded R&D is scientific knowledge, whose purpose is to maximize the benefits of that knowledge in multiple research and disease ar eas in both the public and private sectors.24A common method for tracing NIH -funded activities to drug development used in existing studies, typically conducted by social scientists, is to investigate linkages among NIH funding, scientific publications res ulting from that funding, and biomedical patents. Publications (and publication citations) are a widely used measure of scientific output and productivity as well as knowledge dissemination, and patents are a common measure of innovation. Similar to patent s, publications resulting from federally funded research typically acknowledge federal funding, and thus provide data for studying the linkages.

See app. I for more details about our methodology. 24A distinguishing feature of investments in R&D are knowledge spillovers, which arise when benefits of R &D spill over to others who may use the knowledge, even though they have not paid for the costs of creating that knowledge. Knowledge spillovers are by - products of R&D activities because it is difficult to exclude others from accessing the benefits of such knowledge.Letter Page 12 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchSome studies we reviewed found that NIH generally enables biomedical innovation and drug develo pment through developing scientific knowledge and other indirect support, rather than through direct contributions to specific drugs.25The studies also illustrate limitations related to different methodologies used to analyze NIH contributions. One study t racing linkages from NIH funding to patents and publications found that indirect effects of NIH -funded activities on drug development, as measured by publications cited in patents, are likely greater than direct effects, as measured by grants acknowledged by patents (see sidebar).26 The study 's authors acknowledged that their approach likely underestimated linkages between NIH funding and patenting because it did not account for other NIH contributions, such as NIH -funded biomedical training.27Another study suggested that NIH funding contributed to published research associated with every one of the 210 new drugs approved by FDA from 2010 through 2016.28This study examined a broader set of basic research contributions to drug development through publication c itations, but did not identify the extent to which the publications were pivotal in enabling the development of these drugs. 25We found in our prior work that discoveries made by scientists in the NIH intramural program directly contributed to 34 drugs approved by FDA between 1980 and 2019, including cancer treatments and several vaccines, and that these drugs were as sociated with 93 patents owned by NIH; see GAO -21-52. 26D. Li, P. Azoulay, and B.N.

Cleary et al., \"Contribution of NIH Funding to New Drug Approvals 2010 -2016, \" PNAS , vol. 115, No. 10 (2017).Letter Page 13 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchSeveral studies we reviewed analyzed NIH contributions to biomedical innovation and drug development using nonpublic data from NIH 's internal program management system IMPAC II. NIH, like other federal funders of R&D, possesses extensive microdata about research projects that are reviewed for funding (see sidebar). NIH microdata include complete application data: that is, data on gran t applications, with review scores, that NIH approves for funding (funded research) or rejects for funding (unfunded research that could be funded by entities other than NIH). In addition, NIH microdata have information on all scientists, both established and junior, whose research and training are supported by NIH. As we discuss later in this report, studies that obtained NIH and other federal microdata on funded and unfunded research explored causal relations between federal funding and its outcomes.29 NIH Tracks and Publicly Reports Funding by Grant or Project Funding for biomedical R&D activities \u2014including basic research, clinical trials, and biomedical workforce training \u2014is tracked and reported by NIH at the grant or project level. Because a grant funded by the extramural program (or a project funded by the intramural program) usually supports multiple activities that cannot be easily separated, funding amounts for basic research, clinical trials, and biomedical workforce training represent bundles of rel ated activities and partially overlap. For example, an NIH grant whose primary purpose is basic research can involve an early -stage clinical trial and support training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who carry out the research and are com pensated by the grant funding. The following explains how NIH publicly reports funding for basic research, clinical trials, and biomedical workforce training, and what that funding represents: 29The distinction between causal relations and associations has implications for the kind of conclusions one can draw about the linkage between federal support and drug development. Ca usal relations mean that drug development resulted from the federally funded research. In contrast, associations mean that federally funded research may have contributed to drug development, but association alone does not establish that the former enabled the latter.What Are Microdata? Microdata are unit -level data obtained from sample surveys, censuses, and administrative systems. They provid e information about characteristics of individual people or entities such as households, business enterprises, facilities, farms or even geographical areas such as villages or towns. They allow in -depth understanding of socio -economic issues by studying re lationships and interactions among phenomena. Microdata are thus key to designing projects and formulating policies, targeting interventions and monitoring and measuring the impact and results of projects, interventions, and policies.

NIH reports basic research funding to NSF as pa rt of the annual Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development .30 This funding represents extramural and intramural support for research projects whose main purpose is basic research but which can involve other activities typically performed in conju nction with basic research, such as preclinical studies and early -stage clinical trials. Because basic research and related activities are conducted by teams of scientists, including students and postdoctoral researchers, many grants supporting basic resea rch provide funding for stipends and salaries and serve as an important source of funding for biomedical workforce training. \u00b7Clinical trials. NIH reports extramural and intramural funding for research projects that include clinical trials in NIH RePORT 's Categorical Spending portal under \"clinical trials and supportive activities. \" According to NIH officials, while most funding for clinical trials and supportive activities is classified as applied research funding, some clinical trials are conducted as part of basic research and supported by basic research funding. Effective January 25, 2018, NIH requires all grant applications involving one or more clinical trials to be submitted through a funding opportunity announcement specifically designed for clinical trials.31(Prior to January 25, 2018, grant applications with and without clinical trials could be submitted in response to the same funding opportunity announcements.) 30NSF's Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development is an annual census completed by the federal agencies that conduct R&D programs, including HHS and NIH. The agencies report funding information (obligations and outlays) for different types of R&D, such as basic research, applied research, and experimental development, among other things. NSF requires federal agencies participating in the survey to report R&D funding data that are consistent with the data they submit to the Office of Ma nagement and Budget as part of the preparation of the annual President 's budget request. For more information about the federal government 's reporting of R&D funding data, see GAO, Federal Research and Development: Funding Has Grown Since 2012 and Is Conce ntrated within a Few Agencies , GAO -23-105396 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 15, 2022). 31National Institutes of Health, \"Policy on Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOA) for Clinical Trials, \" NOT -OD-16-147 (Sept. 16, 2016) and \"Reminder: Policy on Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOA) for Clinical Trials Takes Effect January 25, 2018, \" NOT -OD-18-106 (Nov. 30, 2017). NIH adopted funding opportunity announcements specific to clinical trials to improve t he agency 's ability to identify proposed clinical trials, ensure that key pieces of trial -specific information were submitted with each application, and uniformly apply trial -specific review criteria. NIH officials told us that these changes were responsiv e to recommendations in a GAO report examining NIH stewardship of clinical trials; see GAO, National Institutes of Health: Additional Data Would Enhance the Stewardship of Clinical Trials across the Agency , GAO -16-304 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 10, 2016).Letter Page 15 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchAnnouncements stipulate if clinical trials are required, optional, or not allowed. Simil ar to basic research funding, funding for clinical trials can support multiple related activities. It can also support the stipends and salaries of scientists in training involved in conducting the clinical trials. \u00b7Biomedical workforce training . NIH report s extramural funding for biomedical workforce training in the NIH Data Book. The reported funding amount accounts only for grants dedicated to training and career development, and does not account for training (that is, student stipends and postdoctoral re searcher salaries) funded by grants for basic research and clinical trials .32 For fiscal years 2017 through 2021, NIH reported that it obligated $97 billion for basic research, $28 billion for clinical trials and supportive activities, and $9 billion for bi omedical workforce training, according to data from public sources and provided to us by NIH (see table 1).33 Because the funding amounts capture overlapping activities, we did not provide total funding for all three activities for each fiscal year.34 Table 1: National Institutes of Health (NIH) Obligations for Select Biomedical Research and Development Activities, Fiscal Years 2017 through 2021 (in billions) Activity 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Total Basic researcha16.6 18.2 19.0 21.7 21.7 97.3 Clinical trials and supportive activitiesb3.8 5.2 6.1 6.6 6.5 28.2 Biomedical workforce trainingc1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.1 9.1 Source: GAO presentation of information from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and NIH. | GAO -23-105656 Notes: The funding amounts represent nominal dollar values that are not adjusted for inflation. aThese funding amounts are obligations for extramural grants and intramural projects for basic research that NIH reports to the NSF annual Survey of Federal Fun ds for Research and Development . The fiscal year 2021 basic research funding amount is preliminary, according to NSF. 32A working group of the advisory committee to the Director of NIH noted in 2012 that more graduate students and postdoctoral researchers were supported by NIH research grants than by training grants and fellowships; National Institutes of Health, Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group Report (June 14, 2012). 33We requested and obtained obligations data from NIH for clinical trials and supportive activities and biomedical workforce training to ensure consistency with basic research obligations that NIH re ports to NSF. The funding amounts in table 1 reflect extramural and intramural obligations. 34Based on the data NIH reported to NSF in the annual Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development , NIH obligated about $189 billion for biomedical R&D \u2014 compr ising basic research, applied research, and experimental development \u2014in fiscal years 2017 through 2021.Letter Page 16 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchbThese funding amounts are obligations for extramural grants and intramural projects that include clinical trials and supportive activitie s and were provided by NIH. NIH publicly reports expenditures for grants and projects that include clinical trials and supportive activities in the Categorical Spending portal of NIH RePORT. cThese funding amounts are obligations for extramural grants and intramural projects that include training and were provided by NIH. NIH publicly reports only extramural expenditures for training (reflecting extramural grants for career development, research training, and fellowships) in the NIH Data Book. The funding a mounts reported in this table do not account for biomedical research training funded by research grants. NIH officials said the agency 's systems are designed to track funding at the grant level in the extramural program and project level in the intramural program. NIH does not and cannot fully disaggregate funding to the level of various activities funded by those grants and projects. NIH tracks extramural grant funding by requiring grantees to submit budget forms, which provide expenses at the project leve l. These budgets do not include details about whether expenses are for basic research, clinical trials, or training. In accordance with the NIH Grants Policy Statement, grantees generally have the flexibility to rebudget funds and carry over unobligated ba lances from one budget period to the next without NIH approval when changes are within the scope of the approved project.35 According to NIH officials, if NIH were to introduce a requirement to disaggregate funding at the activity level, it would create a c onsiderable administrative burden for grantees and NIH program staff and would be unlikely to produce accurate data with practical value. NIH Did Not Ensure Timely Registration and Result Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov but Is Taking Steps to Improve Compl iance NIH did not ensure that all NIH -funded clinical trials subject to the agency's requirements were registered in a timely manner and their results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in recent years. NIH is taking actions to improve clinical trial registrat ion and result reporting, including by analyzing ClinicalTrials.gov data, according to NIH officials. 35The NIH Grants Policy Statement contains the policy requirements that serve as the terms and conditions of NIH grant awards.Letter Page 17 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchNIH Did Not Ensure Compliance with Registration and Result Reporting Requirements for NIH \u00adFunded Clinical Trials In recent years, NIH did not ensure that all NIH -funded clinical trials subject to the agency's requirements were registered in a timely manner and their results reported in the public database ClinicalTrials.gov. The \"NIH Policy on the Dissemination of NI H-Funded Clinical Trial Information\" issued on September 21, 2016 (henceforth, the NIH 2016 dissemination policy) contains the agency's requirements for the registration of clinical trials funded in full or in part by NIH and reporting of their results on ClinicalTrials.gov.36The responsible party for fulfilling these requirements is generally the clinical trial's sponsor or its principal investigator, if so designated by a sponsor or grantee. For intramural clinical trials, the NIH 2016 dissemination polic y went into effect on January 18, 2017. For extramural clinical trials, the policy applies to grant applications submitted on or after January 18, 2017, that request funding to conduct a clinical trial that is initiated on or after that date.37 Registration of NIH -Funded Trials on ClinicalTrials.gov We found that some NIH -funded clinical trials, including trials testing drugs, were registered late on ClinicalTrials.gov in fiscal years 2019 through 2022. Under the NIH 2016 dissemination policy, parties respon sible for an NIH -funded clinical trial are required to register the trial 36The NIH requirement to re gister the trial on ClinicalTrials.gov no later than 21 days after enrolling the trial's first participant matches the statutory requirement for applicable clinical trials under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. Codified as amended a t 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 282(j); see also 42 C.F.R. pt. 11. 37This means that the effective date of the policy varies for clinical trials funded by NIH grants in recent years and that it does not apply to clinical trials initiated before Jan. 18, 2017, or to trials in itiated after Jan. 18, 2017, if the trials were funded by grants and awards with applications submitted before that date. Because NIH research grants are typically for 3 -5 years, this also means that the percentage of NIH -funded extramural clinical trials that are not subject to the policy has decreased in each year since January 2017. NIH extende d reporting flexibilities under this policy for basic experimental studies involving humans until Sept. 24, 2024; see National Institutes of Health, \"Continued Extension of Certain Flexibilities for Prospective Basic Experimental Studies with Human Participants, \" NOT -OD-22-205 (Aug. 30, 2022). In addition, the policy does not apply to clinical trials that use NIH -supported infrastructure but do not receive NIH fund s to support their conduct.Letter Page 18 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchon ClinicalTrials.gov no later than 21 days after enrolling the trial's first participan t. We found that the number of NIH -funded clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov in each fiscal year from 2019 through 2022 ranged from 1,385 to 1,485. In each of those 4 fiscal years, up to 16 to 18 percent of NIH-funded clinical trials were registered late, and they were registered, on average, between several months and more than 1 yea r late. Although the share of NIH -funded trials subject to the NIH 2016 dissemination policy increased during this period, a similar percentage of NIH -funded clinical trials was registered late in fiscal year 2022 compared to the previous 3 fiscal years. We also found that some of the NIH -funded trials that were registered late involved testing drugs.38The number of NIH -funded drug trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov in each fiscal year from 2019 through 2022 ranged from 437 to 595 , including up to 9 to 10 percent of such trials that were registered late .

Under the \"NIH Policy on the Dissemination of NIH-Funded Clinical Trial Information\" issued on Sept. 21, 2016, parties responsible for an NIH -funded clinical trial are required to register the trial on ClinicalTrials.gov no later than 21 days after enrolling the trial's first participant. However, not all trials included in this table may have been subject to the policy , and ClinicalTrials.gov does not indicate which of the trials are . The information posted on ClinicalTrials.gov shows that some sponsors repeatedly registered clinical trials late.39We found that, among NIH institutes and centers, the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute sponsored the largest number of drug trials that were registered late: 81 and 18, respectively, in fiscal years 2019 through 2 022. Among nonfederal entities, two medical centers with the largest number of late -registered NIH -funded clinical trials sponsored 34 of them during those 4 years. Late registrations prevent members of the public, health care providers, and researchers fr om having timely and accurate information about active NIH-funded clinical trials, including their purpose, recruitment status, and eligibility criteria. In addition, lengthy registration delays raise concern that some trials may never be registered. Late registrations can limit 39NIH defines a sponsor as the org anization or individual who initiates a clinical investigation.Letter Page 20 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchunderstanding of how these trials might contribute to drug development and are inconsistent with the NIH 2016 dissemination policy. Reporting of Results of NIH -Funded Clinical Trials on ClinicalTrials.gov In August 2022, HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported that only about half of NIH -funded extramural and intramural clinical trials complied with NIH requirements for reporting clinical trial results on ClinicalTrials.gov in calendar years 2019 and 2020.40Under the NIH 2016 dissemination policy, parties responsible for NIH -funded clinical trials are required to report the results of such trials on ClinicalTrials.gov within 1 year of the primary completion date. HHS OIG found that parties responsible for 72 NIH -funded clinical trials were required to submit results in 2019 or 2020, but that they did not submit results or submitted them late for, respectively, 25 and 12 of those trials. HHS OIG determined that NIH did not have sufficient procedures to monitor and enforce result reporting, and recommended that NIH improve its monitoring and enforcement procedures for ClinicalTrials.gov.41 As stated in the HHS OIG report, NIH concurred with the recommendations and e xpressed intent to take several actions in response to them. NIH sta ted in the report that it had begun to implement additional enhancements in how it verified compliance and notified clinical trial responsible parties of noncompliance. Trial results must include the number of participants starting and completing the trial , baseline characteristics of the study population, outcome measures and statistical analysis, and adverse events, among other things. As noted in the HHS OIG report, the reporting of clinical trial results on ClinicalTrials.gov helps researchers focus on areas in need of study and avoid unnecessary duplication of studies, improves future research designs, increases public trust in research, enhances patient 40Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, The National Institutes of Health Did Not Ensure That All Clinical Trial Results Were Reported in Accor dance with Federal Requirements , A-06-21-07000 (Washington, D.C.: August 2022). 41Earlier studies had found that the compliance with result reporting requirements was lower among NIH -funded clinical trials than among industry clinical trials. See N.J. DeVito, S. Bacon, and B . Goldacre, \"Compliance with Legal Requirement to Report Clinical Trial Results on ClinicalTrials.gov: A Cohort Study, \" Lancet , vol. 395, no. 10221 (2020); C.

NIH Is Taking Actions to Improve Clinical Trial Registration and Result Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov According to NIH officials, several actions initiated during the HHS OIG audit are expected to bring both registration and result reporting of NIH - funded clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov in compliance with the NIH 2016 dissemination policy going forward. These actions involve expanding monitoring and enforcement protocols for both extramural and intramural clinical trial s. For extramural clinical trials, NIH introduced two measures to improve compliance. First, NIH modified its grant review process to incorporate automatic checks and notifications, according to NIH officials. NIH generally verifies grantees ' compliance wi th the requirements for ClinicalTrials.gov once a year when NIH program officers review grantees ' annual progress reports.42Beginning in October 2021, an automatic check prevents grant recipients from submitting annual progress reports without proof that t hey registered and reported the results of clinical trials funded by their grants on ClinicalTrials.gov as required.43NIH also began to generate quarterly reports, which include data i mported from ClinicalTrials.gov, to determine the number of potentially noncompliant extramural trials and monitor rates of noncompliance. Second, in July 2022, NIH created a new compliance procedure for extramural clinical trials subject to the NIH 2016 dissemination policy.44 42Grantees cannot receive fun ding for subsequent budget years if they do not submit an annual resea rch performance progress report to NIH. 43Grantees submit information about clinical trials funded by NIH grants to an NIH system, which prevents submissions for trials that are overdue to register or submit results; see National Institutes of Health, \"Guidance electronic Research Administration ( eRA) Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR) Submission Validations for Clinical Trial Registration and Results Reporting, \" NOT -OD-22-008 (Oct. 29, 2021). 44According to NIH officials, the compliance procedure, which they referred to as the \"Clinical Tr ials Compliance Workflow, \" was created in collaboration with the HHS Office of the General Counsel and FDA, in an effort to standardize and centralize how NIH verifies that extramural grant recipients are complying with both the 2016 NIH dissemination poli cy and the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007.Letter Page 22 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchThe procedure requires two levels of outreach: first, through the funding institute or center and , second , from the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration, to bring the recipient into compliance before NIH takes an enforcement action. According to NIH officials, a grants compliance of ficer at the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration monitors grantees' compliance with the requirements for ClinicalTrials.gov.45If the recipients do not address NIH's concerns within 60 days of the initial NIH notification, NIH can suspen d grant funding.46 NIH officials told us that, under the new procedure, NIH had brought 235 delinquent grantees into compliance as of November 2022. Further, officials said they expected improved grantee compliance as a result of notification and outreach a ctions, without having to enforce compliance by suspending funding .47 For intramural clinical trials, NIH began requiring in January 2022 both principal investigators and NIH leadership to be notified of failure to comply with registration and result report ing requirements. It also modified procedures during the HHS audit for taking corrective actions regarding intramural researchers who failed to comply with ClinicalTrials.gov reporting requirements. Effective January 14, 2022, NIH can issue letters of repr imand or remove intramural researchers from federal service if they fail to comply with the NIH and federal requirements for ClinicalTrials.gov, among other things.48Before these changes, NIH only notified, but did not penalize, intramural researchers who did not comply with the requirements. 45According to NIH officials, this position has existed for over a decade, and is one of 12 compliance officer positions for the extramural program. 46The specific enforcement actions for noncom pliance with NIH and federal requirements for ClinicalTrials.gov depend on whether an NIH -funded trial meets the definition of the \"applicable clinical trial\" under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, as implemented through federal reg ulation in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.22. If the noncompliant trial meets the definition of the applicable clinical trial under the act, NIH can suspend funding to the grant recipient on an institution -wide basis. NIH notifies FDA when an enforcement action is taken a gainst recipients whose NIH -funded applicable clinical trials have failed to comply with requirements. If the noncompliant trial does not meet that definition and is covered only by the NIH 2016 dissemination policy, NIH can suspend funding of the specific award supporting the noncompliant trial. 47NIH officials told us that the agency has never suspended grant funding for noncompliance with the requirements for ClinicalTrials.gov. 48For the current procedures, see National Institutes of Health, NIH Policy Ma nual, Chapter 3007. Available online at https://policymanual.nih.gov/3007 , accessed Aug. 18, 2022.Letter Page 23 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchAccording to NIH officials, as a result of these actions, all 775 active intramural clinical trials were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as of November 2022. In addition, principal investigators of all 49 intramural trials subject to the result reporting requirement in 2022 reported their results as of December 2022. These 49 trials included two for which results had not been reported within 1 year of the primary completion date, as required by the NIH 2016 disseminati on policy. NIH officials told us the principal investigators of these two trials reported trials results on ClinicalTrials.gov after NIH had withheld approval of new research and initiated other actions consistent with the procedures that took effect in January 2022. Our analysis shows that similar percentages of NIH -funded clinical trials were registered late in fiscal year 2022 compared to the previous 3 fiscal years. This could be because not enough time has passed for the agency 's corrective actions to take effect for all NIH -funded clinical trials. NIH officials told us all information on ClinicalTrials.gov is submitted by the parties responsible for the trials, and that it is incumbent upon those parties to ensure timely registration and result reporti ng of NIH -funded trials. In addition, officials said, ClinicalTrials.gov is not the only source of public information about NIH -funded clinical trials and the public database NIH RePORT provides information about such trials. However, NIH RePORT generally pulls its clinical trial information from ClinicalTrials.gov, and detailed information for specific trials, such as trial protocols and results, is available on ClinicalTrials.gov and not in NIH RePORT.49 Corrective actions, if implemented effectively, will help NIH ensure compliance with the registration and reporting requirements stated in its 2016 dissemination policy. Timely registration of NIH -funded clinical trials and reporting of their results on ClinicalTrials.gov is important for improving transpar ency of NIH research to advance clinical interventions and drug development. In addition, it will help NIH achieve its strategic goal of fostering a culture of good scientific stewardship, which includes timely and accessible dissemination of information a bout NIH -funded activities.50 49National Institutes of Health, \"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) RePORT, \" https://report.nih.gov/faqs , accessed Dec. 13, 2022. 50National Institutes of Health, NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2021 -2025 .Letter Page 24 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchNIH Support Is Not Consistently Disclosed in Patents Arising from NIH \u00adFunded Research NIH awardees do not consistently disclose NIH support in patents arising from research funded by the agency. In our analysis of patents with application dates in calendar years 2012 through 2021, we found that about 2,700 patents did not fully or correctly disclose NIH support. NIH does not provide clear guidance for how awardees applying for patents should disclose the agency 's support. NIH Awardees Do Not Consistently Disclose NIH Support in Patents NIH support is not consistently disclosed by awardees in patents arising from NIH-funded research . In our analysis of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data for patents with application date s in calendar years 2012 through 2021, we found inaccurate and incomplete reporting as well as underreporting of NIH support in patent government interest statements. Specifically, 2,703 patents did not disclose NIH support accurately or completely, and an other 56 disclosed support from a different entity, but likely arose from NIH -funded research.51The implementing regulations for the Bayh -Dole Act require that contractors and awardees use the following wording in their patent applications: \"This invention was made with government support under (identify the contract) awarded by (identify the Federal agency). The government has certain rights in the invention. \"52In terms of the federal agency that should be identified in government interest statements, NIH officials told us they preferred awardees to name NIH, but, as discussed below, the agency 's existing guidance does not explicitly state that. We define inaccurate reporting to involve an incorrect NIH award number and incomplete reporting to involve faili ng to include an award number.53 51We are publishing a dataset with these 2,759 patents, which can be accessed on our website at https://www.gao.gov/products/gao -23-105656 . 5237 C.F.R. \u00a7 401.14(f)(4). The regulations were developed by the National Institute of Standa rds and Technology, an agency in the Department of Commerce re sponsible for the implementation of the Bayh -Dole Act across the federal government. 53According to NIH officials, inaccurate reporting can also involve changing the language in the government interest statement to include conditional language regarding the government 's rights to the invention.Letter Page 25 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchAs shown in figure 2, the NIH award number consists of several elements, including an activity code identifying one of 246 possible award types and an institute code identifying one of 24 NIH institutes that can award fundin g. According to NIH officials, the correct NIH award number must include, at minimum, the two -digit institute code and six -digit serial number to be traceable to the funding institution and the award dollar amount. Figure 2: Elements of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Award Number Accessible Text for Figure 2: Elements of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Award Number A Nation al Institutes of Health (NIH) award number can be composed of up to six elements in the following order: application type, activity code, institute code, serial number, support year, and other suffixes. Two of these elements are required in order for an NI H award to be identifiable: institute code and serial number. Figure 3 summarizes the results of our analysis regarding inaccurate and incomplete reporting of NIH support in patents. We identified 19,055 patents that disclosed NIH support among all patents with application dates in calendar years 2012 through 2021. Of these, 16,352 (about 86 percent) included correct NIH award numbers and the remaining 2,703 (about 14 percent) did not. Of the latter, 2,525 patents (about 13 percent of the total) included an inaccurate award nu mber that did not have an institute code or a six -digit serial number, and 178 patents (about 1 percent of the total) disclosed NIH support incompletely because they did not include any award number.

For example, we found t hat in about 5 percent of these patents the activity code contained the letter O instead of zero. Figure 4 illustrates some common user input errors related to NIH award numbers we found in the patents that disclosed NIH support. Letter Page 27 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchFigure 4: Examples of User Input Errors for National Institutes of Health (NIH) Award Numbers in Patent Government Interest Statements Accessible Text for Figure 4: Examples of User Input Errors for National Institutes of Health (NIH) Award Numbers in Patent Government Interest Statements Examples of common user input errors for National Institutes of Health award numbers include: inputting the letter \"O\" instead of the number \"0\"; using an invalid institute code; and in putting the incorrect number of serial number digits. We found that six patents, which disclosed NIH support and included inaccurate or incomplete award numbers, were associated with three FDA-approv ed drugs. This means that an interested party cannot identify the relevant NIH awards in the public NIH RePORT database to determine the amount of NIH funding that contributed to the development of these drugs. We also found evidence of underreporting of N IH support in patents, which we define as naming an entity other than NIH as the funding agency. We analyzed 5,813 patents with application dates in calendar years 2012 through 2021 that disclosed support from the U.S. government, HHS, the Public Health Se rvice, and the Small Business Innovation Research program, and identified 56 patents that likely arose Letter Page 28 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchfrom NIH -funded research (table 3).54We determined that they likely arose from NIH -funded research based on two factors: the patents disclosed award numb ers that contained an NIH activity code, institute code, and serial number and had a biomedical field classification.55 Table 3: Patents Likely Underreporting Support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with Application Dates in Calenda r Years 2012 through 2021 Patents that disclosed federal support other than from NIH but likely arose from NIH -funded research Number of patents Patents disclosing support from the U.S. government 32 Patents disclosing support from the Department of Health and Human Services 9 Patents disclosing support from the Public Health Service 8 Patents disclosing support from the Small Business Innovation Research program 7 Total 56 Source: GAO analysis of U.S. Pate nt and Trademark Office data. | GAO -23-105656 Note: We determined that a patent likely arose from NIH -funded research if (1) the award number disclosed in the government interest statement contained an NIH activity code, institute code, and serial number; and (2) the patent had a biomedical field classifica tion. To determine the latter, we analyzed the patents ' World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) field classifications. Each patent we analyzed had one or more WIPO field classifications, with the exception of 355 patents without any WIPO field clas sifications. After making a list of all WIPO field classifications associated with 19,055 patents that disclosed support from NIH, we designated fields associated with 95 percent of the patents as biomedical. The biomedical field classifications were : anal ysis of biological materials, biotechnology, chemical engineering, computer technology, macromolecular chemistry, measurement, medical technology, microstructural and nanotechnology, optics, organic fine chemistry, other special machines, and pharmaceutica ls. We provided NIH officials with illustrative examples of six patents from among the 56 patents. These patents are identified in the NIH RePORT 54In addition to NIH, the Public Health Service comprises nine other HHS entities \u2014the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, Health Resources and Services Administration, Indian Health Service, Office of Global Affairs, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \u2014and the Commissioned Corps, a uniformed public health service headed by the U.S. Surgeon General. 55By biomedical field classification, we mean World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) field classifications common for 19,055 patents with application dates i n calendar years 2012 through 2021 that disclosed support from NIH. Each patent we analyzed has one or more WIPO field classifications, with the exception of 355 patents without any WIPO field classifications.

The biomedical field classifications were : analysis of biological materials, biotechnology, chemical engineering, computer technology, macr omolecular chemistry, measurement, medical technology, microstructural and nanotechnology, optics, organic fine chemistry, other special machines, and pharmaceuticals. For more information about our methodology, see app. I.Letter Page 29 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchdatabase, which draws patent data from iEdison, indicating that these patents arose from NIH -funded research.56According to agency officials, an NIH awardee submitted a certificate of correction to USPTO and evidence of the correction to iEdison for one of the six patents.57NIH awardees had not provided a government interest statement in another patent and had not submitted evidence of correction for the four remaining patents, as of December 2022. NIH officials stated they would follow up with these awardees for updates. Our findings are consistent with earlier studies that found evidence of underreporting of federal funding in patent government interest statements. For example, one academic study found that government interest statements were missing in 20 -40 percent of bio medical patents issued between 1980 and 2007 arising from federally funded research, including patents associated with FDA -approved drugs.58USPTO also found evidence of underreporting of federal support in government interest statements. According to its a nalysis of government interest statements in patents granted between 1976 and 2019, 19 percent of those statements disclosed support from the \"U.S. government \" generically instead of naming a specific agency.59This means that about one-fifth of patents wit h government interest statements did not disclose support from the agencies that provided it. When NIH awardees do not disclose the agency 's support accurately and completely, or do not name NIH as the funding agency, the public and other interested partie s cannot 56The iEdison database is used by recipients of federal funding to report their government interest statements and by the funding agencies to review them. According to NIH officials, when NIH rejects government interest statements that disclose NIH support inaccurately or incompletely, NI H awardees who submitted them receive automated iEdison notifications to correct the statements by filing a certificate of correction with USPTO and submitting evidence of doing so to iEdison. 57Patent applicants can correct a mistake in an issued U.S. pate nt by filing a certificate of correction with USPTO. A recent study found that 12 of 16 patents associated with FDA - approved drugs disclosed federal funding by adding a government interest statement through a certificate of correction 6 years, on average, after patent issuance. See M. Durvasula, L.L. Ouellette, and H. Williams, \"Private and Public Investments in Biomedical Research, \" AEA Papers and Proceedings , vol. 111 (2021). 58A.K. Rai B.N. Sampat, \"Accountability in Patenting of Federally Funded Rese arch, \" Nature Biotechnology , vol. 30 (2012). 59USPTO 's analysis shows that 145,177 patents granted in 1976 -2019 had government interest statements. Of them, 27,006 patents (19 percent) acknowledged support from the \"U.S. government. \" See table 2 at https://patentsview.org/government -interest/results - analysis , accessed Sept. 22, 2022.Letter Page 30 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchlink patents to NIH funding and determine the extent of the agency 's involvement in developing the patented technologies, including drugs. NIH Lacks Clear Guidance for How Awardees Should Disclose NIH Support NIH does not have clear guidance for how NIH awardees should disclose its support. NIH officials told us they preferred awardees applying for patents to disclose the agency 's support by naming NIH or the Public Health Service and including the NIH award number that contained, at minimum, the institute code and serial number.60However, the NIH Grants Policy Statement, which lays out the terms and conditions of grant awards, only includes the wording required by the Bayh -Dole Act 's implementing regulations. It does not specify that awardees appl ying for patents should name NIH as the federal agency that provided funding and include an NIH award number containing an institute code and serial number as the two core elements. In addition, disclosing support from the Public Health Service, which cons ists of several agencies besides NIH, on patents arising from NIH -funded research complicates a clear identification of patents linked to NIH funding. In response to our questions, NIH officials told us in November 2022 that they planned to update the Gran ts Policy Statement during the annual review process by October 2023. In addition, NIH 's training materials did not provide clear direction about the agency 's preferred way for disclosing NIH support in patent government interest statements. For example, t raining materials from NIH's 2021 Virtual Grants Conference only summarized the Bayh -Dole Act requirement. By contrast, an NIH training video from 2014, which NIH officials said was outdated, instructed awardees to name NIH as the federal agency providing support and include an award number that followed the award number format in the funding opportunity announcement. NIH officials told us they planned to update the training materials to make awardees aware of NIH 's preferred way for disclosing NIH support in patent government interest statements. 60Under 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 401.5, agencies are permitted to make certain modifications to the required language in the government interest statement, such as, for example, replacing the agency with a particular office within the agency.Letter Page 31 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchFederal standards for internal control call for management to communicate quality information to achieve the entity 's objective \u2014in this case, ensuring that awardees disclose NIH support in patents arising from NIH-funded research.61By providing clear guidance in its Grants Policy Statement and related training, NIH could reduce the number of incorrect government interest statements and improve its awardees ' compliance with the federal support disclosure requirement under the Bayh -Dole Act of 1980. Accurate disclosure of NIH support in patents is important because patent and award data are used to inform the public of the federal government 's involvement. Such data are also used by researchers to investigate linkages between NIH funding and patented biomedical technologies, including drugs.62Patent government interest statements that do not identify NIH as the funding agency or do not include a correct NIH award number make it difficult or impossible to establish such linkages. Microdata Allow Researchers to Better Understand the Impact of NIH Funding, but NIH Does Not Have a Procedure for Them to Access These Data Existing studies using microdata advance analyses of impacts of federal R&D funding on innovation. NIH pro vided nonpublic microdata to some researchers in the past, but does not have a procedure for interested parties to access the microdata for research and evaluation purposes. Studies Using Microdata Can Advance Analyses of Impacts of Federal R&D Funding on Innovation Analyses using microdata can investigate causal relations between federally funded R&D and innovation, including NIH contributions to 61GAO -14-704G . 62For example, see M. Durvasula, L.L. Ouellette, and H. Williams, \"Private and Public Investments in Biomedical Research, \" AEA Papers and Proceedings , vol. 111 (2021); G. Long, \"Federal Government -Interest Patent Disclosures, \" Journal of Medical Economics , vol. 22, no. 12 (2019); R.K. Nayak, J. Avorn, an d A. S. Kesselheim, \"Public Sector Financial Support for Late -Stage Discovery of New Drugs in the United States, \" BMJ, vol. 367 (2019) ; and D. Li, P. Azoulay, and B.N. Sampat, \"The Applied Value of Public Investments in Biomedical Research, \" Science , vol. 356 (2017).Letter Page 32 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchbiomedical innovation and drug development. We identified two types of grant microdata that can be analyzed to improve the public 's, policymakers ', and NIH 's own understanding of how NIH -funded R&D contributes to drug development. The first type is complete grant application data, which are application data on both the research that NIH funded and did not fund (fun ded and unfunded research) that include review scores with thresholds separating winning applications from rejected applications. Complete grant application data enable researchers to explore causal relations between federal funding and its outcomes by enabling comparisons between the outcomes of research funded by NIH and the outcomes of research that NIH did not fund (and which may have been funded elsewhere). The second type is comprehensive data on NIH - funded research staff and trainees. Comprehensive d ata on research staff and trainees can enable tracing of linkages between NIH investments in biomedical workforce training and biomedical innovation. Complete Grant Application D ata Access to complete grant application data can help to identify organizatio ns and scientists that are more likely to receive an NIH award, how the award affects the R&D they conduct, and whether they are more likely than unfunded organizations and scientists to generate more innovative technology that leads to drug development, a mong other things. Researchers studying federal R&D programs, who were given access to complete grant application data, were able to examine causal relations, rather than associations, between agency R&D support and commercial innovation, including drug de velopment. Authors of several studies we reviewed obtained such data from NIH and were able to generate insights that would not have been possible without data on unfunded applications:63 \u00b7One study comparing research funded by NIH with research that was not shows that NIH funding spurs private sector biomedical innovation.64According to the study, a $10 million boost in funding 63Additional studies using internal NIH data may exist. For example, we identified another study that used internal NIH microdata that we do not describe here: D.K. idence from a Prestigious Postdoctoral Training Program, \" Research Policy , vol. 49, no. 4 (2020). 64P. Azoulay et al., \"Public R&D Investments and Public Sector Patenting: Evidence from NIH Funding Rules, \" Review of Economic Studies , vol. 86 (2019).Letter Page 33 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchleads to 2.7 additional private -sector patents and approximately $20 million in drug sales for patents that lead to drugs. To preclu de other drivers of innovation that could affect their findings, the authors developed a quasi -experiment using funded and unfunded grants for a narrow band of applications around NIH funding thresholds in a given disease area. The quasi -experiment assumed that half of applications right below and right above the funding score threshold were expected to receive funding, but if more grants were funded than expected, then a particular research area received more funding. This narrow comparison of funded and u nfunded applications allowed the authors to causally link NIH funding to drug innovation, providing evidence of the return on public investment in science R&D. \u00b7Another study investigated if NIH policy can direct scientific pursuits toward new knowledge are as and technological breakthroughs.65The study found that government policy could induce scientists to shift their research focus from one area of science to another, but that doing so required substantial additional funding to attract new applications. Ac cess to data on unfunded applications allowed the author to characterize whether NIH policy can chart new pathways of scientific innovation in science, because funded applications alone do not capture all applications willing to pursue new areas of science . NIH funds only a limited number of applications each year (NIH success rates for R01 grants in the study were 23 percent), and many meritorious applications do not receive funding. In terms of scientific productivity, awards for new scientific opportunit ies were more productive on a per -dollar basis, but this effect was driven by new opportunities attracting more productive scientists, and for scientists the shift in new research areas was temporary. \u00b7According to a study that used historical NIH data, exp osing medical school graduates to intensive research programs early in their careers could have a large impact on their long -term professional development and productivity of academic research careers.66The study compared physicians selected for NIH 's Asso ciate Training Program with applicants who passed a first admission screening but were ultimately not selected. The authors found that the selected program participants were twice as likely to choose a research - focused position after training. Program part icipants also garnered 65K. Mye rs, \"The Elasticity of Science, \" American Economic Journal: Applied Economics , vol. 12, no. 4 (2020). 66P. Azoulay, W.H. Greenblatt, and M. L. Heggeness, \"Long -Term Effects from Early Exposure to Research: Evidence from the NIH 'Yellow Berets ',\" Research Policy , vol. 50, no. 9 (2021).Letter Page 34 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchpublications, citations, and grant funding at a much higher rate than unfunded applicants, and went on to mentor more trainees who themselves became successful scientists. Program participants acquired a more \"translational \" style of research, allowing them to seamlessly transition their research to clinical practice. This analysis would not have been possible without data on all applicants whether funded or unfunded by NIH. In addition to being the largest federal funder of biomedical R&D, NIH is the second largest funder of the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs. A study using complete application data from the Department of Energy 's Small Business Innovation Research program c ompared outcomes for companies that received and did not receive funding. The study offers an example of analyses researchers could conduct using NIH 's microdata for these programs:67 \u00b7The study found that Small Business Innovation Research grants have stati stically significant and economically notable effects on receiving companies ' measures of innovative, financial, and commercial success compared to similar companies that did not receive such grants. Receiving a grant from the program increases the probabi lity that a firm would patent a technology and obtain venture capital investment, among other things. \u00b7The study also examined outcomes of early -stage versus later -stage R&D, and concluded that the Small Business Innovation Research program could achieve be tter outcomes by reallocating money from larger, later -stage grants to more numerous smaller, early -stage grants, and from older firms and repeat recipients to younger firms and first -time applicants. Comprehen sive Research Staff and Trainee D ata NIH distr ibutes most of its funding via research grants that support principal investigator -led teams of research staff and trainees. The public database NIH RePORT provides information about principal investigators but not about other members of research teams sup ported by grants. In addition, although NIH is the largest public funder of biomedical workforce training in the United States, data about biomedical scientists whose training is and was previously supported by NIH are limited. In 2012, a 67S.T. Howell, \"Financing Innovation: Evidence from R&D Grants, \" American Economic Review , vol. 107, no. 4 (2017).Letter Page 35 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchworking group of the advisory committee to the Director of NIH noted the lack of comprehensive data about biomedical researchers and recommended that NIH take steps to collect information on the biomedical and scientific workforce on an ongoing basis.68NIH officials told u s the agency has improved its internal microdata about the NIH - funded workforce since then . However, NIH 's publicly available data do not capture the extent of NIH investment in biomedical workforce. As a result, the contribution of that workforce to biome dical innovation and drug development is not well understood by NIH or the broader research community. NIH investment in biomedical research training largely determines the size of biomedical workforce in the United States, as discussed in the 2012 working group report. While NIH has some information about NIH - trained scientists who stay in the NIH funding stream and conduct NIH - funded research, NIH officials told us little is known about NIH -trained scientists who pursue careers outside of the NIH funding stream.69For example, little is known about how many NIH -trained scientists go on to work in the pharmaceutical industry, their research output and career progression, and contributions to drug development in that setting. The vast majority of scientists c onducting NIH -funded research are not principal investigators. According to NIH, of the approximately 300,000 scientists supported by the extramural program, about 43,000 (14 percent) are principal investigators and about 257,000 (86 percent) are research staff and trainees. In the intramural program, which supports about 8,000 scientists, 1,200 (15 percent) are principal investigators, 68National Institutes of Health, Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group Report (June 14, 2012). 69The agency has the NIH Alumni Database for scientists who were trained in the intramural program: https://www.training.nih.gov/alumni/register . NIH officials estimated that about 15 percent of former train ees submitted their information to it.Letter Page 36 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Research1,800 (22.5 percent) are staff clinicians and scientists, and 5,000 (62.5 percent) are trainees.70 Individual -level data fr om NIH can be matched with individual -level data from other sources to investigate more fully the research output and career progression of NIH -funded workforce. The Universities: Measuring the Impacts of Research on Innovation, Competitiveness, and Scienc e (UMETRICS) project offers a model of matching such data from different sources to study the relationship between funding, on the one hand, and scientific productivity and career progression, on the other.71The UMETRICS project enables researchers to matc h administrative records for graduate students and research staff at universities where federally funded research takes place with data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources.72For example, studies using UMETRICS data found the following: \u00b7NIH fundin g stimulates research by supporting teams of scientists that conduct it, and the research output of all team members, including research staff and trainees, who are supported by NIH research 70A study published in 2016 used IMPAC II data for grants funded in fiscal year 2009 to conduct the first -ever census of NIH -funded extramural research workforce. According to the study, 50,885 research project grants funded by NIH in fiscal year 2009 created 313,049 full - and part -time positions spanning all job functions involved in biomedical research. These positions were staffed by 247,457 people at 2,604 institutions. Each research project grant supported 6 full - or part -time positions, on average. See L.R. Pool et al., \"Size and Characteristics of the Biomedical Research Workforce Associated with U.S. National Institutes of Health Extramural Grants, \" The FASEB Journal , vol. 30 (2016). 71The UMETRICS project and its data repository are managed by the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science at the University of Michigan. The institute is a consortium of research universities, and it collects record -level administrative data f rom its members to produce a de -identified dataset that researchers use to explain and improve the public value of research. 72At present, UMETRICS data account for about 40 percent of extramural federal funding. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the UMETRICS data are useful for analyzin g the social and economic effects of research investments; the scientific production function; the career outcomes and earnings of graduate students and trainees; questions pertaining to science and engineering workforce and the STEM pipeline; and many oth er possible topics.Letter Page 37 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchgrants, is several times larger than the research output linked t o principal investigators.73 \u00b7Almost 40 percent of federally and nonfederally funded doctorate recipients entered industry, and disproportionately got jobs at large and high -wage establishments in high -tech and professional service industries. Although Ph.D. recipients spread nationally, the employment patterns also reflected geographic clustering near the universities that trained and employed the researchers.74 In addition to providing insights into employment patterns of scientists whose training was funded by NIH, these findings illustrate that analyses using publicly available NIH data that only identify principal investigators understate the effect of public funding on scientific productivity and innovation. Use of individual -level data for all members of research teams would enable a fuller understanding of the scientific workforce involved in conducting NIH -funded R&D. This can in turn enable analyses of the contribution NIH 's support for biomedical workforce training makes to biomedical innovation and d rug development more broadly. NIH Does Not Have a Procedure for Researchers to Access NIH Microdata NIH provided microdata data to researchers in the past on an ad hoc basis, but does not have a procedure describing how researchers who are interested in these data for studying and evaluating NIH activities can access them. IMPAC II, NIH 's internal program management system for extramural research, holds microdata on funded and unfunded grant applications, with application review scores. The microdata incl ude information about principal investigators, research staff, and trainees supported by the extramural program as well as about principal investigators in the intramural program. Data that NIH reports publicly in the NIH RePORT database are generally a su bset of the IMPAC II microdata. 73R. Sattari et al., \"The Ripple Effects of Funding on Researchers and Output, \" Science Advances , vol. 8 (2022). The study was able to compare the number of publications authored by all team members , because UMETRICS data provided inform ation for all team members, including trainees, supported by NIH research funding. 74N. Zolas et al., \"Wrapping It Up in a Person: Examining Employment and Earnings Outcomes for Ph.D. Recipients, \" Science , vol. 350, no. 6266 (2015).Letter Page 38 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchBecause microdata include confidenti al and p roprietary information, they cannot be reported publicly. Access t o such data is governed by federal laws and regulations and is restricted to organizations and entities cleared fo r access based on their research needs and qualifications. In addition, personally identifiable information is generally required to be removed before microdata are made available for restricted access. In recent years, an advisory committee to the Directo r of NIH recommended expanding access to NIH microdata and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) created a unified process for users to access federal microdata: \u00b7In December 2018, an advisory committee to the Director of NIH recommended that NIH increa se accessibility of NIH administrative [microdata] for both members of the biomedical research community and researchers investigating biomedical science.75In response to this recommendation, the agency explored making microdata available for research purp oses in 2019. NIH considered resources needed to establish, maintain, and oversee access to confidential microdata in a secure physical or virtual environment, as allowable under applicable federal laws. Options for a secure environment that NIH considered involved depositing NIH microdata at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the U.S. Census Bureau.76 NIH estimated that the annual costs needed to establish and oversee the data sharing would range from about $116,000 for depositing NIH's microdata at NCHS to $352,000 for depositing the microdata at the U.S. Census Bureau .77According to NIH officials, NIH determined in 2019 that these microdata sharing options were too labor -intensive for its extramural program.78 75National Institutes of Health, NIH Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD) Next Generation Researchers Initiative Working Group Report (December 2018). 76NCHS is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. Census Bureau operates more t han 30 federal statistical research data centers (FSRDCs), which are partnerships between federal statistical agencies and leading research institutions. FSRDCs provide secure environments supporting qualified researchers using restricted - access data while protecting respondent confidentiality. The UMETRICS project discussed above maintains its own data repository and deposits its microdata in an FSRDC. 77By comparison, the average research grant awarded by NIH in fiscal year 2021 was about $594,000. 78NIH of ficials told us in December 2022 that the costs of microdata sharing would be borne by the extramural program 's budget.Letter Page 39 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Research\u00b7In December 2022, the federal government, in collaboration with nonfederal entities, launched a new web -based portal ResearchDataGov for discovery of restricted data in the federal statistical system.79The portal was established to advance the evidence -building capabilitie s of the federal government, a key goal of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018.80The portal allows users to request confidential data from 16 federal statistical agencies, which provided detailed descriptions of each data asset that can be requested.81Users can search for data by topic, agency, and keywords. OMB released a memorandum describing a standard application process for requesting federal microdata.82The memorandum also established a standard set of review criteria that the statistical agencies should use in determining whether to authorize access to their confidential microdata.83Although the process for the ResearchDataGov portal currently applies only to confidential microdata kept by 16 specific statistical agencies as de fined under federal law, the memorandum permits other executive branch agencies to use the system to allow researchers to work with their confidential microdata. The Open, Public, Electronic, and Necessary Government Data Act (Title II of the Foundations f or Evidence -Based Policy Making Act of 2018) requires agencies of the fe deral government to engage the public in using 79See https://www.researchdatagov.org . 80Enacted in 2019, the act created a framework for federal agencies to take a more comprehensive and integrated approach to evidence building. It requires federal evidence - building activities, open government data, and confidential information protection and statistical efficiency. Pub. L. No. 115 -435, 132 Stat. 5529 (2019). 81The ResearchDataGov portal is built and hosted by the University of Michigan 's Inter - university Consortium for Political and Social Research under contract and guidance from NSF's National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics . The data described in the ResearchDataGov portal are owned by and accessed through the agencies. 82Office of Management and Budget, Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies: Establishment of Standard Application Process Requirements on Recognized Statistical Agencies and Units, M -23-04 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 8, 2022). 83Federal law requires standardized criteria across statistical agencies and units for determining whether to grant an applicant the requested access. 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a). Recognizing that the appropriate criteria necessary to place an applicant in a trusted category would vary across data assets and modes of data access, OMB memorandum M-23-04 established several authorization levels.Letter Page 40 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchpublic data and encourage collaboration.84The federal government recently created a unified process \u2014and launched the ResearchDataGov portal\u2014to facilitate the use of federal microdata for research purposes. NIH officials stated improving the understanding of the linkages between NIH-funded basic research, clinical trials, and biomedical training, on the one hand, and drug development, on the other, is worthwhile but challenging. Collaboration with qualified researchers, including those with specialized social science expertise, could help NIH address those challenges. Establishing a procedure for researchers to expand access to NIH's microdat a would be a step toward advancing the agency 's evidence -building capabilities in order to improve the public 's and NIH 's own understanding of its contributions to biomedical innovation and drug development. Conclusions NIH dedicated about $189 billion to biomedical R&D in fiscal years 2017 through 2021 to fulfill its mission of seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and applying that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. Howeve r, the extent to which NIH contributes to drug development is difficult to measure and not well understood. Better data, which involve improvements to existing data and expanding access to microdata, can improve our collective understanding of NIH 's contri butions to drug development. By providing clear guidance in its Grants Policy Statement and related training, NIH can better ensure that its awardees correctly disclose NIH support when applying for patents that arise from NIH -funded biomedical R&D. By dev eloping a procedure to expand qualified researchers ' access to the agency 's microdata, NIH can advance its capabilities to improve understanding of how biomedical R&D it funds, including biomedical workforce training, contributes to drug development. These steps would be consistent with policymakers ' recent efforts to increase the transparency of federally funded R&D, its results, and effectiveness for the benefit of the American public. 84Pub. L. No. 115 -435, \u00a7 201, 132 Stat. 5 529, 5534 -44 (2019). The act includes requirements for federal agencies to (i) provide opportunities for the public to request specific data assets to be prioritized for disclosure and make suggestions for the development of agency criteria on prioritizing data assets for disclosure; and (ii) assist the public in expanding the use of public data assets, among other public engagement requirements.Letter Page 41 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchRecommendations for Executive Action We are making the following two r ecommendations to NIH: \u00b7The Director of NIH should update the Grants Policy Statement and NIH training materials to provide clear guidance that the government interest statement in a patent arising from NIH -funded research should name National Institutes of Health as the federal agency and correctly identify NIH awards using, at the minimum, the institute code and serial number. (Recommendation 1) \u00b7The Director of NIH should develop a procedure describing how researchers can access NIH microdata for the purpo ses of studying and evaluating NIH 's contributions to developing new drugs and treatments.

For all four objectives, we interviewed cognizant officials at the NIH Office of the Director, several NIH institutes and centers, Office of In spector General at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Chief Economist at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as well as former NIH officials knowledgeable about NIH data and evaluation issues. We also interviewed scientists from several dru g discovery centers, researchers from several universities who have received NIH funding or studied NIH and other federal R&D programs, and representatives of the pharmaceutical industry. In the course of our review, we worked with a GAO research librarian to conduct a literature search of studies analyzing the relationship between research and development (R&D) funded by NIH and drug development. The librarian searched several re search databases, including ProQ uest and Scopus, using search terms that inclu ded \"National Institutes of Health, \" \"drug discovery, \" and \"drug approvals, \" to identify papers published from 2011 through 2021. From these searches, we identified and selected relevant studies to include in our review and to identify social science resea rchers to interview. We also reviewed additional select articles that we identified as part of our work or that were recommended to us by the researchers we interviewed, such as a study published in 2022 and illustrative studies that used NIH and federal microdata to evaluate outcomes of federally funded R&D.Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 44 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchTo examine NIH funding for biomedical R&D, we used several sources of publicly available funding data as well as data obtained directly from NIH for fiscal years 2017 through 2021. For basic research, we analyzed obligations data reported by NIH to the National Science Foundation for the annual Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development . For clinical trials and biomedical workforce training, we first considered funding data reported by NIH in the database NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (NIH RePORT). NIH reports funding information for the former in the database 's Categorical Spending portal under \"clinical trials and supportive activities \" and for the latter in the NIH Data Book. Because funding data reported in NIH RePORT may not represent obligations, we obtained from NIH obligations data for clinical trials and supportive activities and for biomedical workforce training to make them comparable to obligations data for basic rese arch. To assess the reliability of these data, we conducted extensive interviews with knowledgeable agency officials about how the data were generated. We determined the data to be reliable for the purposes of presenting the funding amounts for basic resea rch, clinical trials and supportive activities, and biomedical workforce training for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 in our report. To examine the timeliness of registrations of NIH -funded clinical trials in the public database ClinicalTrials.gov, we revie wed NIH registration requirements. Ac cording to the \"NIH Policy on the Dissemination of NIH - Funded Clinical Trial Information\" issued on September 21, 2016 , clinical trials funded in full or in part by NIH must be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov within 21 days of enrolling the first participant.1 For intramural clinical trials, the policy went into effect on January 18, 2017. For extramural cl inical trials, the policy applies to grant applications submitted on or after January 18, 2017, that request fundin g to conduct a clinical trial that is initiated on or after that date. This means that the effective date of the policy varies for clinical trials funded by NIH grants in recent years and that it does not apply to clinical trials initiated before January 1 8, 2017, or to trials initiated after that date, if the trials were funded by grants and awards with applications submitted before that date. Because NIH research grants are typically for 3 -5 years, this also means that the percentage of NIH -funded extramu ral clinical trials that are not subject to the policy has decreased in each year since January 2017. We 1The NIH policy's requirement to register the trial on ClinicalTrials.gov no later than 21 days after enrolling the trial's first participant matches the statutory requirement for applicable drug trials under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. Codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 282(j) ; see also 42 C.F.R. pt. 11.Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 45 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchcould not exclude clinical trials that were not subject to the NIH policy because the existing public data did not allow for a separation of grants for which applications were submitted to NIH before and after January 18, 2017. We obtained and analyzed data for all NIH -funded clinical trials that were registered in fiscal years 2019 through 2022. ClinicalTrials.gov has information on interventional clini cal trials and observational studies. We excluded the latter from our analysis because they do not meet the NIH definition of a clinical trial.2 We analyzed the data to determine the number of all NIH -funded clinical trials registered in each of those 4 fi scal years, including clinical trials that tested a drug; the number of such trials that were registered more than 21 days after enrolling the first participant; and what institutions registered clinical trials late in those 4 fiscal years, and how often. Using these data, we found that in fiscal years 2019 through 2022 the number of all NIH -funded clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov ranged from 1,385 to 1,485, and the number of such trials involving drugs ranged from 437 to 595. We also determ ined that during that period the percentage of NIH -funded trials that were registered late ranged from 1 6 to 18 percent, and the percentage o f NIH -funded trials involving drugs ranged from 9 to 10 percent. These numbers and percentages could overestimate l ate-registered clinical trials because not all NIH -funded trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov during this period may have been subject to NIH's 2016 policy; or they could underestimate late -registered trials if not all NIH -funded trials were registered . To assess the reliability of ClinicalTrials.gov data, we reviewed documentation from NIH, interviewed knowledgeable current and former NIH officials, and reviewed the data for potential errors. Based on our review, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting the timeliness of the registration of NIH -funded clinical trials on ClinicalT rials.gov, with the limitation as noted. To examine the disclosure of NIH support in patent government interest statements, we reviewed applicable statutes, regulations, NIH guidance, 2NIH defines a clinical trial as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health -related biomedical or behavioral outcomes. I nterventions include drugs, medical devices, procedures, vaccines, and other products that are either investigational or already available.Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 46 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchand the federal internal control standards. We determined that the stand ard stating that management should communicate quality information to achieve the entity 's objective was significant to this objective.3 We analyzed data for patents with application dates in calendar years 2012 through 2021 from the public PatentsView dat abase maintained by USPTO. We identified 54,523 patents with government interest statements. For these patents, we examined whether the government interest statements disclosed support from NIH and included an award identification number. We did not review certificates of correction for possible corrections to the government interest statements after the patents were granted. We downloaded the following variables from PatentsView: patent ID, patent application and grant dates, government interest statement text, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) field classification, award numbers, and government organization names and related agency hierarchy (level one, level two, and level three, where the levels specify position of the agency in a hierarchi cal set of relationships). The award numbers, government organization names and related agency hierarchy were identified from the government interest statements by PatentsView.4 We searched through all unique values of the government organization names and agency hierarchy variables for NIH or any of the 27 NIH institutes or centers. In addition, we searched the government interest statement text for various spellings of NIH and its 27 institutes and centers. For the purposes of our analysis, a patent discl osed support from NIH if PatentsView 's government organization variables for that patent included NIH or one of the 27 institutes or centers, or if our search of the government interest statement text detected various spellings of NIH or its 27 institutes and centers. A patent disclosed support from the U.S. government, HHS, the Public Health Service, or the Small Business Innovation Research program if PatentsView 's government organization variables for that patent included these organizations. We also dev eloped an algorithm to detect NIH award numbers. Specifically, we determined the award number to have originated from NIH if one of NIH 's 246 activity codes appeared in the first six characters of the award number and if the 3GAO -14-704G . 4See C. Jones and S. Madhaven, PatentsView Government Interest Extraction and Processing \u2014Version 2.0. American Institutes for Research (May 2020).Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 47 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchaward number contained an NIH i nstitute code and six -digit serial number.5 Using this methodology, we identified 19,055 patents with application dates in calendar years 2012 through 2021 that disclosed NIH support. These patents comprise d 16,352 with a correct NIH award number, 2,525 pa tents with an inaccurate award number that did not have an institute code or a six -digit serial number, and 178 patents without an award number.6 Because, as we found, patent applicants entered the letter O instead of zero in the activity code in about 5 p ercent of the 16,352 patents we characterize as having a correct NIH award number, we incorporated both in our searches of activity codes. We checked the accuracy of our data by manually tracing a sample of award numbers to award information published in t he NIH RePORT database and confirming activity codes and our methods with agency officials. We determined that a patent that did not disclose support from NIH likely arose from NIH -supported research if the award number contained an NIH activity code, inst itute code, and six -digit serial number, and had a WIPO field classification common to the patents that disclosed NIH support. To obtain WIPO field classifications common to such patents, we reviewed the WIPO field classifications of the 19,055 patents that disclosed NIH support. We then identified the WIPO field classifications that were associated with 95 percent of these patents. These field classifications were : analysis of biological materials, biotechnology, chemical engineering, computer technology, macromolecular chemistry, measurement, medical technology, microstructural and nanotechnology, optics, organic fine chemistry, other special machines, and pharmaceuticals. Using this methodology, we identified 5,813 patents with application dates in calend ar years 2012 through 2021 that disclosed support from the U.S. government , HHS, the Public Health Service, and the Smal l Business Innovation Research p rogram, and determined that 56 of these patents likely arose from NIH -funded research. To assess the rel iability of PatentsView data, we reviewed documentation from USPTO, interviewed knowledgeable officials, and reviewed the data 5We also found several activity codes, such as \"BC\" and \"RR,\" that were not on NIH 's official list of 246 activity codes posted on the agency 's website . For these activity codes, we confirmed with NIH officials that they belonged to NIH and included them in our list. 6In addition, our search of the government interest statement text found that 783 of the 19,055 patents disclosed support from an institute or center, but not NIH.Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 48 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical Researchfor potential errors. Based on our review, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting the extent to which NIH awardees did not fully or correctly disclose NIH support in patent government interest statements. To determine whether the patents that did not fully or correctly disclose NIH support were associated with drugs approved by the Foo d and Drug Administration (FDA), we merged our patent dataset by patent ID with product data from the FDA Orange Book products and patent files as of December 2022.7 We reviewed Orange Book documentation, reviewed our prior work using these data, and valid ated the results by manually searching the Orange Book. Based on our review, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting the number of FDA -approved drugs associated with the patents in our analysis. To examine the accessibility of NIH internal microdata for research and evaluation purposes, we reviewed applicable statutes, federal policy guidance, and relevant reports by advisory groups convened by the Director of NIH. We interviewed current and former NIH official s about access to microdata held in NIH 's internal Management, Planning, Analysis, and Coordination II (IMPAC II) database. We interviewed academic social science researchers who were knowledgeable about studies using federal microdata or used such data, including NIH IMPAC II data, in their own published research. We interviewed academic researchers who participated in the Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group convened by the Director of NIH.8 We also interviewed a representative of the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science at the University of Michigan that manages The Universities: Measuring the Impacts of Research on Innovation, Competitiveness, and Science (UMETRICS) project, which collects microdata from participating universities, and researchers who used the UMETRICS data in their research. 7FDA's Orange Book identifies drug products approved on the basis of safety and effectiveness by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. As we reported in prior work ( GAO -21-52), the Orange Book lists only currently active patents and only those reported to FDA by the company applying for FDA approval, according to FDA officials. 8National Institutes of Health, Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group Report (June 14, 2012).Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 49 GAO -23-105656 NIH Biomedical ResearchWe conducted this performance audit from January 2022 to April 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit t o obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

GAO Recommendation 1: The Director of NIH should update the Grants Policy Statement and NIH training materials to provide clear guidance that the government interest statement in a patent arising from NIH - funded research should name National Institutes of Health as the federal agency and correctly identify NIH awards using, at the minimum, the institute code and serial number. HHS Response: HHS Concurs with GAO's recommendation. NIH will make appropriate edits to the NIH Grants Policy Statement, Section 8.2.4 Inventions and Pat ents (Exhibit 8), to provide clear guidance to NIH federal funding recipients that they should name in the government interest statements \"National Institutes of Health\" as the federal agency and correctly identify NIH awards using, at the minimum, the ins titute code and serial number. NIH expects updates to be included in the next scheduled revision of the NIH Grants Policy Statement in October 2023. Additionally, NIH will update training materials to provide similar guidance. These Invention Reporting tra ining materials were not presented at the recently held 2023 Virtual NIH Grants Conference but will be updated at the next available opportunity for such presentations in the future, along with including this clarification in the next \"NIH Update\" presenta tion on changes and new policy requirements that NIH presents to associations of recipients of federal research funds throughout the year.
