My baby girl is frank breech and my OB is feeling pretty certain she's not going to flip based on how far down her booty is in my pelvis. She wants me to continue spinning babies, chiropractic care, acupuncture, and moxibustion. But she's also asking if I'm open to trying an ECV (external cephalic version) if she hasn't turned by 36 weeks. Has anyone had this procedure? If so, did your baby turn? Was it really painful? Did you take any pain meds or nitrous oxide?

The doctor said we still had some time. So I don't even know what to do. I'm currently 33 weeks and 4 days. She didn't seem concerned so I don't have good im advice for you. But I hope something works for you and your baby turns - I did one completely unmedicated. They did offer me a spinal but I declined. I wanted the baby to be active to give them a better shot at maybe moving them. I don't really know if that helps or not but that was my thought process. My baby was tucked way up in my rib cage. Everytime they almost had them they would snap back like a rubber band. They tried for almost an hour and had to stop. My C-section was scheduled after that. It was uncomfortable. And I have heard of some women being brought to tears and screaming over it. That wasn't my experience. It hurt but I could handle it that I wasn't crying.Advertisement | page continues below - CrazyNumber6 said:I did one completely unmedicated.

Super helpful. - Hopefulmommytobe3 said:What is moxibustion?Internet definition: Moxibustion is a treatment within traditional Chinese medicine. A practitioner burns the herb \"moxa\" on or above the skin to warm and stimulate specific points on the body. Practitioners use moxibustion either as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with acupuncture. My OB said there's actually some good research behind it! When I do it my baby starts to move A LOT. But she doesn't flip :) - I had an successful ECV with my last pregnancy. I had several factors working against me; low amniotic fluid, anterior placenta, and I was being induced at 37w because of a high risk pregnancy. Doc and I decided to try and turn him the morning of induction. That way, if it didn't work, I would just deliver via c-section. I opted for an epidural just in case things went south and we had an emergency situation (which we all had actually expected to happen, given the circumstances). Fortunately, my doctor and a colleague were able to get him turned within a short period of time, maybe 30 mins, and I went on to have a uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Given the way they were wrenching on me, I don't think I could have done it without the epidural. I bow down to those that have! I'll also mention, I had zero pain or bruising from the ECV. I was expecting to be in quite a bit of pain from it afterward, but that was fortunately not the case! - CrazyNumber6 said:I did one completely unmedicated.

That's am...Unfortunately my pain tolerance came from a bad upbringing but I see nothing wrong with women who can't handle it. No one should face pain when not needed. I have had unmedicated births as well and I've had some contractions that have made me quietly cry to myself and think \"why did I do this again?!\" So I'm definitely not immune to pain. But my threshold is a bit high. I'm in awe of all women in our ability to endure nine months of sickness, pain and delivery of all kinds just to love another person more than ourselves. All of you ladies deserve your own standing ovation! - teachermamakinder said:Thank you for sharing your experience! Super helpful.Most definitely, discuss with your doctor. There are some risks with attempting these that scared me a bit but they do it in a hospital setting should anything go wrong. And thankfully it's always attempted when the baby is full term. Personally I think it doesn't hurt to try. C sections are a big deal and the recovery process is harder on the body. So if you need any sort of pain management I'd suggest iv drugs or the epidural as was offered to me. I'm not a personal fan of messing with oxygen levels with gas while pregnant that's just my personal opinion. I feel it puts the baby at more risk. Don't be afraid to ask your doctor questions and continue your research. But it's worth a shot to "}
