But they did more than that, as they helped people get their lives back in order. as hodgkinson says, those affected \"were overwhelmed by the volume and speed of the flood. part of our role was to support and educate them so they could make good decisions about their health.\"Photo by Lisa Squires | mEEt alBErta h Ealth s Ervic Es' NEW lEadEr vickie kaminski became alberta health services' (ahs) new president and cEo on may 26. she brings to the table more than 35 years of experience in the canadian health care system, first as a front-line nurse, a nurse manager and executive and, for the last 15 years, as the president and chief executive officer of various organizations. Q: what's first, now that you're cEo of Ahs?A: my first job is learning the landscape. i need to connect with the front line. When i think about what a cEo should be doing, my primary job should be to eliminate any barriers front-line staff may have or feel. i also need to have a relationship with the community at large; to say to albertans: 'if you have issues or concerns, let us know. t ell us and we're going to do our best to meet your needs and expectations.' Q: what type of changes are you envisioning?A: i'll be looking at how we maintain quality of care and maintain appropriate wait times. how do we make sure we're serving the right person, at the right time, doing the right thing? What kinds of structures do staff need to help them move through that? Q: many would say there have been incidences of political interference in the past when it comes to your position. how do you plan to handle the politics of Alberta? A: politics and health care go together. We elect our political leaders, give them tax dollars and tell them they need to spend it in the areas important to us. health care has always been, and will always be, one of the most important areas to canadians. as long as we're funded by tax dollars, you as a taxpayer will have your say through the politician. When we see an increase in the politicization of decisions, it's because there is a loss of confidence. my job is to bring confidence to the position and to the organization, and to earn the confidence of albertans. if we have that kind of a relationship with the people of alberta and with the staff of ahs and with the physicians, i think we'll be on the right path. n KAMINSKIl o C a l l e a d e r s PAGE 2 the southern alberta floods of 2013 might have been the most visible emergency situation faced by south Zone, but we have also dealt with disease outbreaks, phone and power outages, grassfires, and storms. as health care providers, it's our responsibility to reduce the impact those situations might have on our facilities, and to maintain delivery of health services to our patients and communities. south Zone has been able to \"fight these fires\" thanks to a process that actually grew out of the firefighting services in the late 1960s. the incident command structure (ics) is a standard management practice used to co- ordinate emergency responses. ics is used across North america and Europe to help manage natural and man-made disasters. it was even used in New y ork on sept. 11, 2001. during emergencies, miscommunication can lead to gaps or duplication of work as organizations try to respond. With ics, people are assigned to specific tasks and report directly to an \"incident commander\" until the issue is concluded. Everyone works from the same game plan by assigning people with specific roles to support and lead operations, planning, logistics, liaison, finance, safety and public information. When events impact several communities and involve many of our facilities - such as the 2013 floods - we establish a Zone Emergency operations centre (ZEoc). the ZEoc usually headquarters in a room at one of our ahs facilities, but could also be established virtually where members connect via phone, t elehealth videoconference or computer. our ZEoc often mirrors and supports the municipal and provincial governments' own emergency response efforts. We liaise with those Eocs for a co-ordinated response. We want to thank all the south Zone staff and others who regularly go \"above and beyond\" in supporting our response to emergency situations. your commitment is truly appreciated.

Now, they have given up the dog-show circuit and share their acreage just west of lethbridge, with their kids, luke and roxie. ginny is also a member of the oldman river health advisory council. of his career, dalshaug says teamwork was the foundation. \"i had good people around me, i learned from other managers and medical officers of health. i had tremendous opportunities to grow and learn as a leader and manager of Environmental public health,\" dalshaug says. \"they taught me how to be part of a team and how to help others succeed.\" nIn times of crisis and in times of calm, Brian Dalshaug holds a key position as manager of Environmental Public Health for South Zone. But he credits his accomplishments to teamwork south Zone executive leadership team Brian Dalshaug, South Zone's manager of Environmental Public Health, says lifelong learning is pivotal to expanding his skillset.

Besides having to evacuate her own family, cook also had to evacuate 58 montessori students, aged 19 months to six years old. \"our biggest concern was those kids,\" says montessori director christine Weimer. \"We always put their safety first.\" Weimer says closing for the summer wasn't an option, not just for the sake of the children and their families, but also for the 10 staff who would have been temporarily out of work. thanks to support from staff, the montessori parents, volunteers and a little synchronicity, they were able to evacuate and temporarily relocate to a facility on higher ground. and during that time, Baxter kept in contact with cook on the status of the montessori site. \"the support networks in place were great and todd was really helpful in helping us get back up and running by september,\" says cook. Baxter is modest, saying it was just part of the job and that he was glad to help. \"people just wanted some normalcy and they looked to us to reassure them everything had been properly cleaned,\" he says. and what of cook's trip of a lifetime?although delayed by 10 days, she was able to go and spend almost a month in india. \"i'm so grateful for the support we received,\" says cook. \"there are still people today who don't know the outcome of their homes, but we felt supported from every angle and it really helped make things less overwhelming.\" ni n Y o u r z o n e PAGE 3 Story and photo by Lisa Squires |AHS Environmental Public Health inspectors helped desperate home and business owners avoid rough sailing to get back on track A career in health care can be extremely rewarding. Visit the AHS website for career details. www.albertahealthservices.caWhile life has returned to normal for many affected by the June 2013 floods, Enivronmental public health (Eph) staff continue to support families, homes and businesses still reeling from the impact. public health inspector pamela hodgkinson says that during the floods, the Eph teams \"worked a lot of long, hard hours\" - something she's really proud of. on average, south Zone's public health inspectors do five to six inspections daily in medicine hat. But when the floods hit, nine inspectors did a whopping 2,100 inspections over a nine-day period. they also issued 83 executive officer orders deeming some properties unfit for human habitation and in need of remediation, while others received closure orders. of those, about 20 properties still have outstanding orders. Eph teams are working with the city of medicine hat and property owners to either bring these up to standard or determine if they'll be demolished. in addition, Eph teams inspected 25 restaurants, three daycares, three schools, the temporary field hospital set up in crescent heights, the reception and evacuation centres and st. Joseph's home, which had to be evacuated - not to mention managing a huge influx of daily calls to the office. hodgkinson hopes no one will experience that scope of disaster again but says the Eph team is ready: \"our staff is well-trained and ready to get our boots on the ground and do the work our community needs when it's needed.\" n Eph tEams arE rEady to roll WhEN thEy'rE NEEdEdsmoothin G wAtErs followin G thE floods A year after the floods, Alberta Health Services Environmental Public Health Inspector Todd Baxter reconnects with Montessori daycare owner Dana Cook, centre, and director Christine Weimer.sErvic Es iN yoUr comm UNity BrEAst cAncEr scrEEninG screen t est provides screening mammograms at two fixed location clinics, one in calgary and one in Edmonton. screen t est also has two mobile screening trailers providing services to women in over 100 communities in rural alberta. t o find a clinic or mobile site near you, visit www.screeningforlife.ca. trAvEl hEAlth sErvicEs Before you travel outside of canada, contact ahs travel health services for information about the possible risk of communicable diseases when travelling and ways to prevent them. you can also get your travel immunizations.

Visit the AHS website for symptom information. www.albertahealthservices.caswiss army knives ... that's how thomas mountain, alberta health services (ahs) manager of addiction and mental health, described the work and versatility of the community paramedics during last year's flood relief efforts in southern alberta. \"our health care team was set up at the University of lethbridge reception centre to serve high river evacuees,\" says mountain. \"Everyone soon came to recognize that the two community paramedics were essential members of the team.\" at the time, community paramedics played a relatively new role within ahs. these specially trained paramedics are able to perform assessments, diagnostics and treatment in the community - services that would otherwise need to be done in an ahs facility. their services can range from using an electrocardiogram to measure heart activity, to monitoring vital signs, collecting laboratory specimens, administering medications, treating wounds, catheterization, and rehydration therapy. two community paramedics, lethbridge-based deb Branden, and t aber- and v auxhall-based angeline abela, were involved in flood relief efforts in medicine hat and at the University of lethbridge. \"i was in medicine hat for three days helping set up and work in the evacuation centre at medicine hat college,\" says Branden. \"We were assisting people with filling their basic needs from being displaced - medication, minor wound care, prescriptions and housing.\" in lethbridge, Branden and abela helped with the hundreds of high river evacuees: arranging eye exams, obstetrics exams and referrals to physicians and mental health providers. \"it was very rewarding to get them on the right track toward getting their lives back together,\" says Branden. abela says she enjoyed being part of a stabilizing presence for displaced high river residents. \"i was at the U of l helping setting up the reception centre when people just started to arrive,\" says abela. \"the immediate needs for people had already been taken care of at the other reception centres, so our role was mainly to be there for them. t o be accessible, to sit and talk with them, listen to them. provide an environment for them where they could feel a bit more settled.\" mountain says both women's efforts were appreciated. \"Whether they were called upon to take vitals, co-ordinate a prescription refill, make referrals to a local physician, be prepared to respond to emergencies, or just provide a listening ear, no job was too big or small for our community paramedics,\" he says. \"the community paramedics bridged several services and meant the rest of our ahs team could go about our tasks with confidence, knowing we had the additional support available when we needed it. like a swiss army knife.\" nStory and photos by James Frey | Community paramedic Angeline Abela prepares the EMS ambulance for its next patient.BRANDENmEEt thE sWiss army kNivEs oF commUNity carE Strategic Clinical Networks (SCNs) Alberta's engines of innovation Learn more at www.albertahealthservices.ca/scnFollow us on Twitter for updates from our SCNs @AHS_Innovatesthousands of people lost their homes and businesses a year ago in June, when the south saskatchewan river spilled its banks into the low-lying areas of medicine hat. it's been a year since the mud and water receded, but the disaster is still taking a toll on many of the 10,000 residents who were evacuated. Flood recovery mental health therapists carolina hall and Natalia samayoa were hired to support the ongoing recovery by working in the flood-affected schools with students who were affected by the devastation. it didn't take long to realize that the need stretched far beyond the school grounds. \"We saw almost right away that just working in the schools wouldn't even begin to touch the scope of this,\" says samayoa. \"When we would connect with a student, it often would connect us with parents, seniors and adults in their lives who were also affected, so it's grown into a community outreach program.\" after the immediate crisis passed and people started to move back to their homes, the daunting job of rebuilding their lives from scratch led to emotional trauma for many. \"parents and seniors were coming forward and were really struggling after they were back in their homes,\" says hall. \"some lost everything. \"a lot of seniors are still feeling really isolated. But they don't want to go out; they're afraid the flood might happen again. they usually have a community within their seniors' homes where they can gather, but those rooms were damaged and aren't yet rebuilt.\" to help seniors stay connected with others, hall and samayoa started holding regular coffee groups at flood-affected christ the king church, which has become a central place for meetings and gatherings since the flood. \"it's not a typical position,\" says hall, a registered provisional psychologist. \"Usually, we'd be assigned to three or four schools or we'd be in clinic all day. i am working in three schools, but a typical day might be doing one-on-one therapy at one school, and then doing groups around anxiety and anger management. then we're working with seniors and planning things for families.\" coralee rahn, manager of addiction and mental health programs in the east part of south Zone, says teamwork and outreach has been key. \"We were asked to join the inspection teams that were going to the flood-affected areas,\" recalls rahn. \"v ery quickly our value became apparent in being able to help with the softer, people-side of things so inspectors and utility people could go in and do their work.\" samayoa says she's been moved by the resiliency shown by children. \"sometimes the parents and the adults have struggled to take the time to deal with this traumatic event due to the overwhelming amount of stress and extra responsibilities that have been added to their lives,\" she says. \"the children sometimes end up being the anchor for the parents, showing and sharing coping skills. it's pretty humbling and pretty amazing.\" people of all ages have often expressed the fear of another flood. \"We provide them with strategies to help them cope,\" says hall. \"i can't guarantee it's not going to happen again, but i try to provide them with strategies to reduce those worries.\" n H e a l t H C a r e H e r o e s PAGE 5 For the latest health news updates in your zone, visit the AHS website. www.albertahealthservices.cahEaliNg thE mENtal damagE Story by Sherri Gallant | Photo by Lisa SquiresFlood waters have receded, but the emotional toll is still very highvisit Us oNliNE hEAlth AdvisoriEs get the latest, up-to-date health advisories for your area on the alberta health services website.

Robotics on the brain calgary neurosurgeon dr. garnette sutherland has spent his career breaking new ground in neurosurgery. his first \"world first\" was a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) system for operating rooms. it provides surgeons with 3-d images during an operation. he followed that with another milestone: the neuroarm, the world's first mri-compatible surgical robot for both microsurgery and image-guided biopsy. surgeons control the neuroarm from a workstation, guiding its movements via images on a screen. Because it can move in smaller increments than the human hand, neuroarm is the ideal tool for performing delicate surgery inside the brain. 4. 10. 5.From heart attacks to colds, genetics to food science, researchers in Alberta are discovering new treatments and developing new technologies to improve the health of Albertans and people around the world. Take a look at 10 groundbreaking innovations developed in our province. Story by Connie Bryson | For more innovations, visit applemag.ca Groundbreaking drug for hep B the first oral medicine to treat chronic hepatitis B infection was developed by dr. lorne tyrrell at the University of alberta. lamivudine is a groundbreaking drug for patients with this chronic viral infection - about 300 to 350 million people worldwide. these people cannot clear the virus from their body; they are at high risk of serious liver damage, as well as death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. lamivudine stops the virus from replicating, which minimizes liver damage. alBErta: hotBEd oF iNNovatioNs Keeping a steady beat cardiologist dr. anne gillis is an international leader in the use of devices like pacemakers to treat heart rhythm disorders. Under her leadership, calgary's cardiac arrhythmia service became the first centre outside the U.s. to evaluate remote monitoring of patients with implantable defibrillators. her research has led to refinements in pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, improving the quality of life for countless heart patients. 2.Food safety first in 2008, deli meats contaminated with the listeria bacteria led to 22 deaths in canada. thanks to research by three University of alberta scientists - drs. lynn mcmullen, michael stiles and John vederas - there's a life-saving food additive that kills this deadly bacteria without any chemicals. their micocin technology is now used by food- packaging companies to ensure the safety of food products.6. 8.Getting a good night's sleep sleep apnea is a life-threatening condition that interrupts breathing during sleep. the University of calgary's dr. John remmers was the first to demonstrate that the condition is due to a narrowing of part of the throat. he developed a device to keep the airway open during sleep: the cpap (continuous positive airway pressure) device. the cpap essentially eliminates sleep apnea and dramatically improves sleep quality. 9.Dressing for success With his invention of the acticoat technology, dr. robert Burrell revolutionized wound care and helped save the lives and limbs of thousands of patients around the world. Working as a biomedical engineer at alberta's Westaim t echnologies inc., Burrell developed tiny silver nanocrystals that kill microbes and stop inflammation. acticoat dressings are used worldwide to prevent life-threatening infections and promote healing in burns, ulcers and other wounds. Rules change for heart transplants heart transplants in babies are different from those in adults, thanks to research by cardiologist dr. lori West. she discovered that infants can receive a heart from a donor with an incompatible blood type; in adults, donor and recipient blood types must match. Because infant immune systems can adapt to a mismatched donor, this widens the pool of potential organs and decreases wait times. Creating a lab in a box an alberta company is turning the notion of a lab test on its head. instead of a lab that requires floor space and equipment, aquila diagnostics systems inc. has developed a device the size of a toaster that can do all kinds of molecular tests - determine whether a patient is resistant to cancer drugs, identify a strain of malaria, pinpoint infectious disease in a herd of cattle, and more. the science behind the technology comes from the work of University of alberta cancer researcher dr. linda pilarski. the device has the potential to replace millions of dollars of equipment in a conventional lab with something that is much less expensive and can be used anywhere.Gene-mapping workhorse a tool developed at the University of alberta in the 1990s became the workhorse of the human genome project - an international research effort to map all of our genes, which paves the way for new understanding of genetic factors in disease. developed by analytical chemists drs. Norman dovichi and Jianzhong Zhang, the instrument analyzed dNa 10 times faster than earlier technology. Nothing to sneeze at one of canada's most popular over-the-counter cold and flu medicines was developed in alberta. cold-FX came out of research at the University of alberta on the active ingredients in traditional herbal medicine. it's derived from the roots of the ginseng plant, one of the most valued medicinal plants in the world.When mom amy Zuk gave birth to her son Ethan Zuk-olsen prematurely on oct. 23, 2013, she was very concerned for her baby's health. \"it was a scary time having Ethan so early,\" says Zuk of Ethan, who was born at 34 weeks in what should normally be a 40-week gestation. Ethan was born with breathing apnea, the temporary interruption of breathing during sleep that re-occurs at night. But there's help for babies suffering from breathing problems at birth, especially preemies. the neonatal intensive care unit (NicU) at the medicine hat regional hospital is now home to a synchronized inspiratory positive airway pressure (sipap) infant flow generator, a machine that uses a non-invasive mask over the nose and/or mouth to help inflate the lungs. the mask is used in conjunction with small prongs inserted in the nostrils to administer a precise mix of air and oxygen. t oo little oxygen is not good, but too much can be a problem as well, particularly for small babies, where there is evidence that excessive oxygen can cause lung damage and blindness. \"the sipap is great because it's a non-invasive alternative to intubating newborns - a procedure that requires inserting a tube in a sedated baby's throat to assist breathing,\" says kelly garland, respiratory therapist in the NicU. intubation requires babies be transferred to Foothills hospital or alberta children's hospital in calgary, therefore, using the sipap is beneficial in that it helps keep mom and baby from having to travel far from southern alberta. \"Babies tolerate the sipap very well because it's comfortable and the airflow is heated to the right temperature,\" says garland. \"and, unlike intubation, baby doesn't need to be sedated.\" While Ethan was lucky to avoid having to use the sipap , his heart rate, oxygen level and breathing were monitored while in the hospital. \"it was worrisome watching Ethan all the time and making sure he didn't stop breathing, and it was then i realized how important breathing equipment is,\" says Zuk, 35. Zuk stayed in the foundation-supported family room at the hospital during Ethan's three-week stay, so she was close to him all the time. \"the staff were wonderful and i couldn't ask for better care of Ethan,\" says Zuk. Because of this, Zuk decided to give back to the hospital. While watching the 17th annual christmas t elethon hosted by the medicine hat & district health Foundation last december, Zuk donated $1,000 toward this equipment. the telethon raised an impressive $589,263, $19,000 of which was used to purchase the sipap , which joins one already at the hospital. heather Bach, Executive director of the medicine hat & district health Foundation, is thrilled to help the NicU with this equipment. \"i'm proud to be part of such a caring community,\" says Bach.

It was Zuk's way to thank the Medicine Hat Regional neonatal intensive care unit for the care Ethan received after his premature birth and subsequent breathing problems. as the wife of a two-time cancer survivor, lorelee marin says she rededicated her life to preventing cancer the day her husband henry was first diagnosed with leukemia in 1999. \"my passion for cancer prevention and screening began that day 16 years ago,\" says lloydminster resident marin. \"t oday, it has grown to include the development of healthy public policy and environments that support healthy living and reducing risk of cancer, and improving access to services and supports in rural alberta.\" to that aim, marin became a member of the provincial advisory council (pac) on cancer. it consists of eight volunteer members who bring first-hand perspectives to alberta health services (ahs) cancer care services across alberta. \"We need to build awareness around the prevention of cancer,\" says marin. \"We need to empower albertans to make choices that reduce their risk of cancer.\" and empowering albertans to make the right choices is the goal of a new ahs campaign that aims to reduce the risk of cancer in the province by up to 50 per cent. \"We want to inform albertans about accessible and achievable lifestyle choices that can reduce their cancer risk,\" says dr. laura mcdougall, medical and scientific director, alberta cancer prevention legacy Fund, ahs. \"We felt the most effective way to do this would be to create a new website that acts as a one-stop shop for information on all the preventative clinical supports and programs already offered throughout the province.\" the new website, www.albertaprevents cancer.ca, is funded through alberta's cancer prevention legacy Fund (acplF), and was developed through research and consultation with the public and the pac on cancer. \"an effective public health campaign needs strong community support,\" says mcdougall. \"By having the pac on cancer available to test-market things at an earlier stage, we were able to incorporate valuable public perspectives into our approach and messaging.\" the campaign asks albertans to consider what they would do with their lives and loved ones if they had more time together. \"i really want the campaign and the website to be successful. i told acplF that it needs to be encouraging and engaging so that each of us has the ability to make a difference in our lives and those around us, and i think they got that,\" says marin. \"i am privileged to serve albertans as a council member on the provincial advisory council on cancer and as a core committee member for the strategic clinical Network on cancer.\" For more information on the pac on cancer, visit www.albertahealthservices.ca/4312.asp. ncaNcEr campaigN pacs poWErFUl mEssagE Story by Kristin Bernhard | WE NEEd to EmpoWEr alBErtaNs to makE choicEs that rEdUcE thEir risk oF caNcEr - Lorelee Marin, member of the Provincial Advisory Council on Cancer and wife of a two-time cancer survivorsouthloc Al lEAdErshi PZone AHS embraces local leadership and zone-based decision-making.

As the anniversary of the floods nears, this is an excerpt from one of his blogs. n n n With spring's arrival and the recent warm temperatures in alberta, some albertans who experienced floods last year may be feeling anxious or afraid. i want to share a few thoughts on how you can turn your memories and fears to your advantage. Dealing with painful memories: y ou may have felt sadness or any number of emotions since last summer. it's important that we acknowledge these feelings and respect them. some things may never be quite the same, but you've shown incredible strength and resiliency in getting to this point. that's something you can feel very positive about. Facing fears: We can't control everything that will happen in the future. that's just part of being alive. But what we can do - as individuals, families and communities - is to prepare and plan for whatever life may bring. Being ready is one great way to tackle our fears.
