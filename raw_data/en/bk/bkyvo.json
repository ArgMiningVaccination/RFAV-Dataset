Policies and programs set forth in this handbook are effective through the academic year 2020-2021. Changes in the content of the student handbook may be made, at anytime, by the university, division, or college administration. Adequate notice of anticipated changes will be given to the student, whenever possible. This student handbook supersedes all previous handbooks, documents, and directives where they may be in conflict. The student handbook is the governing document for all program-related information. Please become familiar with the policies and procedures listed within. Failure to read this handbook does not excuse students from the rules, policies, and procedures contained in it. The university recognizes that individual programs require different times for the completion of academic studies leading to a degree. Therefore, the time frame is a matter within the discretion of each academic program. All program/center catalogs, bulletins, and handbooks carry this information. Students should refer to their individual program's or center's catalog and/or student handbook for further information about academic programs, policies, and procedures. 09-019-20NOM Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook III NSU COVID-19 Return of the Sharks Protocol Nova Southeastern University (NSU) considers the health, safety, and well-being of its students and community to be one of its top priorities. In the midst of these unprecedented pandemic conditions, NSU continues to follow federal, state, and local guidelines to put in place extensive provisions and protocols to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in NSU facilities and locations. NSU takes its responsibilities seriously, and the university counts on its students to take their responsibility to comply with safety practices and protocols seriously as well, understanding that some risks lie outside of anyone's control. NSU cannot guarantee a completely COVID-19-free environment. However, to address the health and safety of the NSU community and reduce the risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus, NSU has created policies and protocols for mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Taking steps to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infections at NSU is a shared responsibility. It is critical that all students adhere to these policies and protocols, as well as national, state, and local guidelines, for their own well-being and the well-being of those around them. Students are expected to comply with the NSU safety policies and protocols related to COVID-19, including the protocols set forth in the Return of the Sharks Student Guide . Residential life students are also required to comply with the Addendum to the 2020-2021 Residential Life and Housing Contract and the Residential Life COVID-19 Preparedness Guide , which include additional health and safety protocols and policies specific to residential life. The NSU policies and protocols for responding to COVID-19 may be updated at any time, as additional information about COVID-19 is obtained, and /or as additional guidance is issued from federal, state, and local governmental bodies and agencies. As such, students are responsible for continuing to monitor their NSU email for any updates to this handbook, as well as nova.edu/ehs/cv19-resources/index.html for additional updates. Failure to comply with the NSU safety policies and protocols related to COVID-19 may result in immediate removal from campus and a referral to the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs, or the applicable college /academic program, for disciplinary action in accordance with the university's Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility. By returning to any NSU campus, as well as living in NSU housing or sponsored housing, students assume the risk of exposure to certain dangers, including, but not limited to, possible exposure to communicable diseases such as the COVID-19 virus. COVID-19 is a highly infectious, potentially life-threatening disease declared by the World Health Organization to be a global pandemic. There is no current vaccine available to the public for COVID-19. The disease's highly contagious nature means that contact with others, or contact with surfaces that have been exposed to the virus, can lead to infection. Additionally, individuals who may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus may be asymptomatic for a period of time, or may never become symptomatic at all. Because of its highly contagious and sometimes \"hidden\" nature, it is currently very difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 or to determine whether, where, or how a specific individual may have been exposed to the disease.IV Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook Again, you have NSU's commitment to continually enhance its efforts to maintain a safer environment. However, by making the decision to return to any NSU campus or reside in NSU housing or sponsored housing, each student is acknowledging that he or she fully understands the risks associated with COVID-19 and is doing so freely and voluntarily. We are all in this together as we all commit to follow proper, known protocols to better contain COVID-19 here in our shared community. Resurgence of COVID-19 NSU is committed to both providing the highest quality education, as well as keeping safety at the forefront of every decision that the university makes. The 2020-2021 academic year will require a significant amount of flexibility that will enable the university to be prepared for any change in circumstances. In that regard, NSU is planning to use the BlendFlex model for the majority of its course offerings. This model simultaneously offers face-to-face and online delivery of instruction. NSU BlendFlex courses include a portion of the students attending in a traditional classroom setting, while the remaining students attend from a remote location using videoconferencing type technologies, including Zoom and Canvas. There may be certain programs that do not lend themselves to the BlendFlex model, including courses requiring experiential learning, such as those containing laboratory and clinical components. Students should consult directly with their programs for further information regarding their course delivery model. In the event of a resurgence of COVID-19, NSU may take certain steps to protect the health and safety of the university community. These may include transitioning back to a fully online platform. In making this transition, NSU will continue to provide the same high-quality education that students receive face-to-face, while striving to limit disruption to student learning during this transition.

NSU alumni are showing the world that NSU Sharks are an unstoppable force of nature, and soon you will too. Enjoy your time at NSU, and fins up Sharks! George L. Hanbury II, Ph.D. President and Chief Executive Officer Message from the President2 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook Foreword/Reservation of Power Foreword For the purpose of promoting its educational mission, Nova Southeastern University (NSU) has the inherent right to preserve order and maintain stability through the setting of standards of conduct and the prescribing of procedures for the enforcement of such standards. In addition to maintaining order and stability, whenever possible, the university aims to utilize its disciplinary procedure as a developmental process. In accordance with this philosophy, educational assignments may be added to any disciplinary penalties. The foundation underlying such student standards relies on the tenet that the exercise of individual rights must be accompanied by an equal amount of responsibility. This assures that the same rights are not denied to others. By becoming a member of the university community, a student acquires rights in, as well as responsibilities to, the whole university community. These rights and responsibilities are included in this handbook. Students are required to comply with all NSU regulations as well as all local, city, county, state, and federal laws. All students are subject to the policies and procedures as contained herein. The term \"students\" includes any individual enrolled in a course or academic program offered by Nova Southeastern University, whether in a degree-seeking program or not. In addition, any student residing in university residence facilities is subject to these policies and procedures for violations occurring within those facilities. Any act that constitutes a violation or an attempt to violate any of the policies or procedures contained herein may establish cause for disciplinary and/or legal action by the university. In circumstances where this handbook defines a violation more stringently or differently than local/state law, the handbook's definition shall supersede. The university is not limited to or bound by the definitions contained in the local/state statutes or case law in addressing student conduct violations. Students are also subject to rules and regulations that apply to academic programs of the various schools and colleges of the university, including but not limited to, the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility. Students should familiarize themselves with their individual college academic, conduct, and professionalism standards, in addition to the information contained in the NSU Student Handbook . Students who engage in conduct that endangers their health or safety, or the health or safety of others, may be required to participate and make satisfactory progress in a program of medical evaluation and/ or treatment if they are to remain at the university. The determination as to the student's participation and progress is to be made by the NSU Student Behavioral Concerns Committee. The university reserves the right to require the withdrawal of a student from either enrollment and/or university housing, whose continuation in school, in the university's judgment, is detrimental to the health or safety of the student or others. The Student Behavioral Concerns Committee, in its judgment, can also place conditions upon a student for either remaining in school or returning from a leave of absence. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, mandating that a student attend counseling. Students who withdraw for reasons of health or safety must contact the Office of Student Conduct before seeking readmission to NSU. Decisions made under this policy are final. Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 3 In lieu of, or in addition to, disciplinary action, NSU also reserves the right to impose fines, take legal action, rescind housing privileges, revoke study abroad privileges, withhold student records, revoke other privileges, and impose other penalties as may be deemed appropriate. Students should also be aware that disciplinary action may impact eligibility for scholarships or other institutional financial aid. Furthermore, admission of a student to Nova Southeastern University for any semester does not imply or guarantee that such student will be reenrolled in any succeeding academic semester. Students may also be subject to disciplinary proceedings for acts committed before their admission and/or enrollment at Nova Southeastern University. Reservation of Power The NSU Student Handbook is not intended to be a contract or part of a contractual agreement between NSU and the student. From time to time, it may be advisable for the university to alter or amend its procedures or policies. Reasonable notice may be furnished to the university community of any substantive changes, but is not required. Whenever specific titles are used in these procedures, they shall include the appropriate designee of the person bearing these titles. Whenever references to the singular appear in this handbook, the plural is also intended; whenever the plural is used, the singular is also intended. Wherever a reference is made to the masculine gender, the feminine gender is included. Failure to read this handbook does not excuse students from the rules, policies, and procedures contained within the student handbook. The rights and responsibilities that follow take effect immediately upon publication of this document. University Vision Statement, Mission Statement, and Core Values Vision 2020 Statement By 2020, through excellence and innovations in teaching, research, service, and learning, Nova Southeastern University will be recognized by accrediting agencies, the academic community, and the general public as a premier, private, not-for-profit university of quality and distinction that engages all students and produces alumni who serve with integrity in their lives, fields of study, and resulting careers.4 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook Mission Statement The mission of Nova Southeastern University, a private, not-for-profit institution, is to offer a diverse array of innovative academic programs that complement on-campus educational opportunities and resources with accessible, distance-learning programs to foster academic excellence, intellectual inquiry, leadership, research, and commitment to community through engagement of students and faculty members in a dynamic, lifelong learning environment. NSU Core Values ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE Academic excellence is the provision of the highest quality educational and learning experiences made possible by academically and professionally qualified and skilled instructional faculty and staff, opportunities for contextual learning, state-of-the-art facilities, beautiful surroundings, and effective resources necessary to support learning at the highest level. Additionally, academic excellence reflects the successful relationship between engaged learners and outstanding instructional faculty and staff. STUDENT CENTERED Students are the focus of institutional priorities, resource decisions, and planning. We are stewards of student needs and advocates for student academic success and professional development. INTEGRITY Integrity involves honesty and fairness, consistency in instruction, ethics of scholarship, freedom of inquiry, and open and truthful engagement with the community through effective communication, policies and practices. SCHOLARSHIP/RESEARCH Research and scholarship products are disseminated and evaluated through intellectual discourse, application, assessment, and other mechanisms of the relevant peer community. DIVERSITY Diversity includes, but is not limited to, race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy status, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, martial status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, military service, veteran status, or political beliefs or affiliations. Differences in views, interpretations, and reactions derived from diversity are important. Diversity enriches a learning environment focused on preparing individuals to live and work in a global society. OPPORTUNITY Opportunity fosters the possibility for anyone associated with NSU to acquire an education or an educational experience through creative, yet sound, pedagogical programs. INNOVATION Innovation is the creative and deliberate application of teaching, research, scholarship, and service for effective education, and the development of useful products or processes providing a value added to the community. COMMUNITY NSU is a community of faculty and staff members, students, and alumni who share a common identity and purpose. Our community extends into professional, intellectual, and geographical domains that both support and are the focus of our educational mission. (The NSU Mission Statement, Vision 2020 Statement, and Core Values were adopted by the NSU Board of Trustees on March 28, 2011.) Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 5 Statement on Student Rights Nova Southeastern University, as a community of women and men, is committed to furthering scholarship, academic pursuits, and service to our society. As an institution, our purpose is to ensure all students an equal opportunity to fulfill their intellectual potential through pursuit of the highest standards of academic excellence. Nova Southeastern University students enjoy the right to learn, both within and outside of the classroom, in an environment that is free from discrimination based on the University Equal Opportunity/ Nondiscrimination Policy included below. While it is not possible to address all eventualities, it is important that rights of NSU students be embraced by the community and observed in the spirit of the university's mission. These rights include, but are not limited to, the right to scrupulous respect for the equal rights and dignity of others the right to be treated equally in academic and social settings the right to live and/or attend classes in a physically safe environment the expectation of a positive living/learning environment the right to hold other students accountable to the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility the rights of personal and intellectual freedom which are fundamental to the idea of a university the right of dedication to the scholarly and educational purposes of the university the right to participate in promoting and ensuring the academic quality and credibility of the institution the right to provide service to our community and beyond the right to engage in service opportunities that enhance learning outcomes, both on and off campus the right to associate with student organizations of one's own choosing6 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook University Equal Opportunity/Nondiscrimination Policy Consistent with all federal and state laws, rules, regulations, and/or local ordinances (e.g., Title VII, Title VI, Title III, Title II, Rehab Act, ADA, Title IX, and the Florida Civil Rights Act), it is the policy of Nova Southeastern University not to engage in any discrimination or harassment against any individuals because of race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy status, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, military service, veteran status, or political beliefs or affiliations, and to comply with all federal and state nondiscrimination, equal opportunity, and affirmative action laws, orders, and regulations. Any such acts are unacceptable and strictly prohibited by the university. In addition, the law prohibits retaliation against an individual for opposing any practices forbidden under this policy, for bringing a complaint of discrimination or harassment, for assisting someone with such a complaint, for attempting to stop such discrimination or harassment, or for participating in any manner in any investigation or resolution of a complaint of discrimination or harassment. This nondiscrimination policy applies to NSU's education activities and programs, including admissions; enrollment; scholarships; loan programs; athletics; employment; and access to, participation in, and treatment in all university centers, programs, and activities. NSU admits students of any race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy status, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, military service, veteran status, or political beliefs or affiliations, to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at NSU, and does not discriminate in the administration of its educational policies, admission policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs. The following person has been designated to handle inquiries and complaints regarding perceived discrimination and NSU nondiscrimination policies: For inquiries or complaints regarding perceived discrimination based on gender or sex, please contact Laura Bennett Title IX Coordinator (954) 262-7858 laura.bennett@nova.edu or titleix@nova.edu Website and online reporting form: nova.edu/title-ix Office location: Office of Human Resources 3100 SW 9th Ave., #248 Fort Lauderdale, FL 33315 Inquiries about the application of Title IX may be directed to the Title IX coordinator, the assistant secretary of education of the United States, or both. All other inquiries or complaints regarding perceived discrimination should be directed to Michelle Manley, Ph.D. Assistant Dean for Student Development (954) 262-7281 mmichell@nova.edu Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 7 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) affords a student certain rights with respect to his or her education records. These rights include: The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the university receives a request for access. A student should submit to the Office of the University Registrar a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The Office of the University Registrar will arrange for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. The right to request the amendment of the student's education record that the student believes is inaccurate or misleading. A student who believes that his or her education records contain information that is inaccurate or misleading, or is otherwise in violation of the student's privacy or other rights, may discuss his or her concerns informally with the Office of the University Registrar. If the decision is in agreement with the student's requests, the appropriate records will be amended. If not, the student will be notified within a reasonable period that the records will not be amended and will be informed by the Office of the University Registrar of his or her right to a formal hearing. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, collection agent, loan servicing agent, or the National Student Clearinghouse); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate education interest if the school official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the university may disclose educational records, without consent, to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll or is already enrolled, so long as the disclosure is for purposes related to the student's enrollment and transfer. The right to file a complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, D.C., 20202-4605, concerning alleged failures by Nova Southeastern University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The right to be notified of students' rights under FERPA annually. The Office of the University Registrar sends a FERPA notification via email to all students each fall. Nova Southeastern University hereby designates the following student information as public or directory information. Such information may be disclosed by the institution for any purpose, at its discretion: student name local and home address telephone numbers 8 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook email addresses photo I.D. major field of study participation in sports place of birth dates of attendance degrees, honors, and awards received enrollment status year in school anticipated graduation date Release of Student Information A student can give consent to permit Nova Southeastern University to discuss and/or release personal identifiable information to a third party such as a spouse, a parent, a guardian, etc. This consent must be provided in writing with the student's signature. To provide a written consent, complete the Authorization for Release of Information form available on the Office of the University Registrar's website. A student may also withhold directory information (as defined above) by completing the Request to Prevent Disclosure of Directory Information form . A student is warned, however, that some of the consequences of preventing disclosure of directory information may be undesirable: a student's name will not be published on the Dean's List or commencement bulletins, and requests from prospective employers are denied. Completed forms may be mailed to Nova Southeastern University, Office of the University Registrar, 3301 College Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, FL, 33314-7796, or dropped off at the One-Stop Shop locations in the Horvitz or Terry Administration buildings, or scanned and emailed to nsuregistrar@nova.edu . Conduct Notifications University personnel may use administrative discretion with parental or legal guardian notification, in writing and/or by phone, of a student younger than 21 years of age when violations of university alcohol or drug policies occurs, or when a student's health or safety is at issue. Deceased Student Records Records of a deceased student will be made available to the parent(s), spouse, or executor/executrix of the deceased student and other authorized parties upon written request. The request must include the need for the records, must identify the requestor's relationship to the deceased student, and must be accompanied with an official record certifying authorization to receive the student records\u2014e.g., assignment as executor/executrix. An official copy of the death certificate must accompany the request, if the university does not have prior notice of the student's death. The university reserves the right to deny the request. For additional assistance on this matter, students should contact the Office of the University Registrar. Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 9 Health Care Privacy (HIPAA) Statement The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires \"covered entities\" to abide by the regulations governing the privacy, confidentiality, and security of protected health information, defined as individually identifiable health information created, received, maintained, or transmitted at or by a covered entity, whether such information is electronic, written, or spoken. NSU is considered a \"hybrid entity\" for purposes of compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Regulations, as NSU's business activities include both covered and noncovered functions. As such, NSU's covered health care centers are subject to the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Regulations, as well as policies implemented by NSU. Pursuant to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Regulations, each covered NSU health care center is responsible for enacting privacy and security policies and procedures. Thus, the various NSU health care centers that provide patient care in a HIPAA-covered setting have enacted such policies and procedures. All NSU health care center workforce members including\u2014but not limited to\u2014faculty members, employees, and trainees, are responsible for following the policies and procedures implemented by the applicable NSU health care center. In addition, the HIPAA Regulations require that NSU provides training to its health care center faculty members, employees, and trainees with respect to its HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Research policies and procedures. NSU has developed a comprehensive online education program designed to comply with the HIPAA Regulations and to educate its workforce members and others who use, disclose and/or access protected health information. Applicable NSU health/mental health profession students and trainees will be required to complete the education program coordinated through his or her respective college/academic program. Violations of the NSU policies and procedures regarding privacy and security of protected health information will be reported to the appropriate supervising authority for potential disciplinary action up to, and including, dismissal in accordance with the applicable college/academic program policies. Further, NSU faculty members and students may be subject to the HIPAA privacy and security policies and procedures enacted by various non-NSU health care facilities in which they train. It is the responsibility of the faculty member and student to familiarize himself or herself with such policies and procedures upon entering each facility. Any questions concerning the HIPAA privacy policies can be directed to the HIPAA liaison of your NSU health care center, the NSU HIPAA privacy officer, or the NSU HIPAA security officer. Please see the NSU Health Care Centers HIPAA Privacy Policies and Procedures on the NSU Office of HIPAA Privacy website at nova.edu/hipaa-privacy . Statement on Student Responsibilities Nova Southeastern University's mission is to foster academic excellence and intellectual inquiry, as well as to provide service to our community and beyond. Committed to excellence and proud of the diversity of our university family, we strive to develop our students in a lifelong learning environment. Students at Nova Southeastern University enjoy the right to exercise freedom of conduct that is consistent with the mission and values of the university. Protection of academic and social freedom 10 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook is both an individual and community responsibility. Standards of behavior have been established by the university and are intended to ensure that the exercise of individual rights does not deny rights to other individuals or the community. Admission to Nova Southeastern University is a privilege, and the values, principles, rules and regulations of the university are accepted by each student upon his or her voluntary registration. Central to the educational experience is the trust that all students will learn in, and benefit from, a rigorous academic environment. All Nova Southeastern University students are responsible for upholding the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and promoting the Core Values of the university. While it is not possible to address all eventualities, it is important that responsibilities of Nova Southeastern University students be embraced by the community and observed in the spirit of the university's mission. Specific standards of behavior are outlined in the Code of Student Conduct. General responsibilities include, but are not limited to: Personal responsibility responsibility to cultivate personal growth and development through academic, civic, and social engagement responsibility to pursue educational opportunities to the best of one's ability responsibility for academic progression and career planning responsibility to participate in intellectual discourse/attainment or advancement of knowledge responsibility to explore personal growth and development responsibility to partner and/or cooperate with faculty and staff in the promotion of a positive living and learning environment Responsibility to other students responsibility to approach differing and diverse views and opinions with an open mind responsibility to recognize the value of diversity and an exchange of ideas within a university community responsibility for showing respect to other students Responsibility to the community responsibility to engage in appropriate service learning experiences that improve the quality of life of those around them responsibility to comply with laws, rules, and regulations responsibility and accountability for one's own actions responsibility to maintain the property and facilities of the university responsibility to maintain a positive image of the university Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 11 Code of Student Conduct The university is a community of scholars in which the ideals of freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and freedom of the individual are sustained. However, the exercise and preservation of these freedoms and rights require a respect for the rights of all in the community to enjoy them to the same extent. It is clear that in a community of learning, willful disruption of the educational process, destruction of property, and interference with the orderly process of the university as defined by the university administration or with the rights of other members of the university cannot be tolerated. Students enrolling in the university assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the university's function as an educational institution. To fulfill its functions of imparting and gaining knowledge, the university retains the power to maintain order within the university and to exclude those who are disruptive to the educational process. In support of the Code of Student Conduct, any violations of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and/or university policies and procedures may result in disciplinary action and/or criminal prosecution. Violations of academic and/or supplementary standards will be handled through the student's academic college or center. Student violations of conduct standards, university policies, and/ or procedures will be handled by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs, or through the individual college when appropriate. An academic unit, as a result of professional education standards/ requirements, may have additional procedures to address student misconduct. Reports of student sexual misconduct are subject to the Title IX/Sexual Misconduct Policy and related procedures, which may ultimately result in sanctions as described in the Code of Student Conduct. When a report of student sexual misconduct falls outside of the jurisdiction of Title IX, it will be referred for adjudication in accordance with the Code of Student Conduct. Changes to the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will be posted on the Student Affairs website. Students are required to be familiar with the rules, policies, and Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility. All student organizations are subject to university rules and regulations concerning conduct as set forth in this handbook, whether an incident occurs on campus or anywhere off campus. Procedures for investigating and adjudicating each kind of incident are provided later in this handbook. In circumstances where this handbook defines a violation more stringently or differently than local or state law, the handbook's definition shall supersede. The university is not limited to or bound by the definitions contained in local or state statutes or case law in addressing code of conduct violations. Academic Standards The university is an academic community and expects its students to manifest a commitment to academic integrity through rigid observance of standards for academic honesty. The university can function properly only when its members adhere to clearly established goals and values. Accordingly, the academic standards are designed to ensure that the principles of academic honesty are upheld. 12 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook The following acts violate the academic honesty standards: cheating\u2014intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise fabrication\u2014intentional and unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise facilitating academic dishonesty\u2014intentionally or knowingly helping or attempting to help another to violate any provision of this code plagiarism\u2014the adoption or reproduction of ideas, words, or statements of another person as one's own without proper acknowledgment Students are expected to submit tests and assignments that they have completed without aid or assistance from other sources. Using sources to provide information without giving credit to the original source is dishonest. Students should avoid any impropriety or the appearance thereof in taking examinations or completing work in pursuance of their educational goals. Students are expected to comply with the following academic standards: Original work\u2014Assignments such as course preparations, exams, texts, projects, term papers, practicum, or any other work submitted for academic credit must be the original work of the student. Original work may include the thoughts and words of another author. Entire thoughts or words of another author should be identified using quotation marks. At all times, students are expected to comply with the university and/or program center's recognized form and style manual and accepted citation practice and policy. Work is not original when it has been submitted previously by the author or by anyone else for academic credit. Work is not original when it has been copied or partially copied from any other source, including another student, unless such copying is acknowledged by the person submitting the work for the credit at the time the work is being submitted, or unless copying, sharing, or joint authorship is an express part of the assignment. Exams and tests are original work when no unauthorized aid is given, received, or used before or during the course of the examination, re-examination, and/or remediation. Referencing the works of another author\u2014All academic work submitted for credit or as partial fulfillment of course requirements must adhere to each program center's specific accepted reference manuals and rules of documentation. Standards of scholarship require that the writer give proper acknowledgment when the thoughts and words of another author are used. Students must acquire a style manual approved by their center and become familiar with accepted scholarly and editorial practice in their program. Students' work must comport with the adopted citation manual for their particular center. At Nova Southeastern University, it is plagiarism to represent another person's work, words, or ideas as one's own without use of a center-recognized method of citation. Deviating from center standards (see above) is considered plagiarism at Nova Southeastern University. Tendering of information\u2014All academic work must be the original work of the student. Knowingly giving or allowing one's work to be copied, giving out exam questions or answers, or releasing or selling term papers is prohibited. Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 13 Prohibited acts\u2014Students should avoid any impropriety, or the appearance thereof, in taking examinations or completing work in pursuance of their educational goals. Violations of academic responsibility include, but are not limited to, the following: plagiarism any form of cheating conspiracy to commit academic dishonesty misrepresentation bribery in an attempt to gain an academic advantage forging or altering documents or credentials knowingly furnishing false information to the institution Additional matters of ethical concern\u2014Where circumstances are such as to place students in positions of power over university personnel, inside or outside the institution, students should avoid any reasonable suspicion that they have used that power for personal benefit or in a capricious or arbitrary manner. Conduct Standards Students should not interfere with the rights, safety, or health of members of the university community nor interfere with other students' right to learn. Students are expected to abide by all university, center, and program rules and regulations and all local, state, and federal laws. Students are responsible for adherence to the university code of conduct and all university policies and procedures while attending or participating in university-sponsored programs, activities, and/or events off the Fort Lauderdale/ Davie Campus or at any NSU site(s). Additional information about specific violations of the Code of Student Conduct is included in this handbook, under section B. Specific Conduct Violations. NSU University-Wide Religious Holidays Policy 1. NSU, although a secular institution, values the diversity of its student body, including diversity in religious expression. NSU recognizes that the religious diversity of its students may result in potential conflicts between work-restricted religious high holidays and educational activities such as classes or scheduled examinations. NSU seeks to accommodate students with personal religious beliefs who wish to observe work-restricted religious holidays. The following provisions apply to all faiths and religious groups equally. 2. This policy applies to all NSU students. 3. Students will not be penalized for approved class absences due to work-restricted religious holidays. This policy does not apply to required attendance in the clinical care setting. 4. The university has developed an interfaith calendar that can be found online at nova.edu /studentconduct/religious-holiday-policy.html , and which includes the recognized work-restricted religious holidays that have been approved by NSU. The calendar is published annually at least one month prior to the start of the fall semester. Approved absence requests for additional work-14 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook restricted religious holidays that are not included on the NSU interfaith calendar should be directed to the NSU assistant dean for Student Development at (954) 262-7281, who will evaluate the request, determine whether such religious accommodation will be approved, and notify the student and college/program of the outcome. 5. A student with a personal religious belief, requesting to be excused from class or an educational activity for a work-restricted religious holiday, shall notify the NSU assistant dean for Student Development at mmichell@nova.edu or (954) 262-7281 within three calendar days after the start of the semester. NSU may request documentation or information from the student's religious institution in order to establish a legitimate need for accommodation. Absences for travel associated with religious observances are not deemed approved absences for purposes of this policy. A student's absence request for a work-restricted religious holiday will not be approved if the student fails to provide requisite notice for the absence request and/or provide requisite documentation. The failure to obtain approval for an absence may result in a penalty from the college or program. 6. With appropriate advance notice and approval, accommodations will be provided. The type of accommodation provided is within the discretion of the program, and may vary by course or program depending on the nature and type of educational activity in conflict. An absence for the observance of a work-restricted religious holiday does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the coursework required during the period of the absence, and missed work remains the student's responsibility to complete. It may not be possible to make up certain academic experiences, including, but not limited to, experiential group activities, as well as laboratory and clinical activities. Approved absences may extend program length or require repetition of a course. 7. It may not be possible to miss extensive periods of a scheduled academic class or experience (e.g., labs, residential institutes) due to the format of the program (e.g., weekend). Students should check the academic calendar prior to enrollment to determine whether they can meet the obligations of the program. 8. If a student's request is approved and he or she believes his or her respective college or program is not complying with this policy, and/or if a student has any questions about this policy, please contact the NSU assistant dean for Student Development at (954) 262-7281. NSU Interfaith Work-Restricted Religious Holiday Calendar NSU recognizes that there are additional religious holidays and observances beyond those identified in this calendar. However, the NSU Religious Holidays Policy and Calendar is limited to those religious holidays that have been recognized as work-restricted religious holidays. 2020: Sundown on Wed., April 8 through Sundown on Fri., April 10 2021: Sundown on Sat., March 27 through Sundown on Mon., March 29 2022: Sundown on Fri., April 15 through Sundown on Sun., April 17First two (2) days of PassoverJudaism Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 15 2020: Sundown on Tues., April 14 through Sundown on Thurs., April 16 2021: Sundown on Fri., April 2 through Sundown on Sun., April 4 2022: Sundown on Thurs., April 21 through Sundown on Sat., April 23Last two (2) days of PassoverJudaism 2020: Sundown on Wed., July 29 through Sundown on Thurs., July 30 2021: Sundown on Sat., July 17 through Sundown on Sun., July 18 2022: Sundown on Fri., Aug. 5 through Sundown on Sat., Aug. 6Tisha B'Av Judaism 2020: Sundown on Thurs., July 30 through Sundown on Fri., July 31 2021: Sundown on Mon., July 19 through Sundown on Tues., July 20 2022: Sundown on Sat., July 9 through Sundown on Sun., July 10Eid al-Adha Islam 2020: Sundown on Fri., Sept. 18 through Sundown on Sun., Sept. 20 2021: Sundown on Mon., Sept. 6 through Sundown on Wed., Sept. 8 2022: Sundown on Sun., Sept. 25 through Sundown on Tues., Sept. 27Rosh Hashanah Judaism 2020: Sundown on Sun., Sept. 27 through Sundown on Mon., Sept. 28 2021: Sundown on Wed., Sept. 15 through Sundown on Thurs., Sept. 16 2022: Sundown on Tues., Oct. 4 through Sundown on Wed., Oct. 5Yom Kippur Judaism 2020: Sundown on Fri., Oct. 2 through Sundown on Sun., Oct. 4 2021: Sundown on Mon., Sept. 20 through Sundown on Wed., Sept. 22 2022: Sundown on Sun., Oct. 9 through Sundown on Tues., Oct 11First two (2) days of SukkotJudaism 2020: Sundown on Fri., Oct. 9 through Sundown on Sun., Oct 11 2021: Sundown on Mon., Sept. 27 through Sundown on Wed., Sept. 29 2022: Sundown on Sun., Oct. through Sundown on Tues., 2020: Sundown on Sun., Oct. 18 through Sundown on Mon., Oct. 19 2021: Sundown on Sat., Nov. 6 through Sundown on Sun., Nov. 7 2022: Sundown on Wed., Oct. 26 through Sundown on Thurs., Oct. 27Birth of the B\u00e1b /Birth of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1hBah\u00e1'\u00ed A. General Administrative Policies and Guidelines A.1 Alcohol Policy Nova Southeastern University, as an institution of higher education, is dedicated to the well-being of all members of the university community\u2014students, faculty members, employees, and administrators. Concerned with the misuse of alcohol and other drugs (both licit and illicit), NSU endeavors to prevent substance abuse through programs of education and prevention. NSU recognizes alcoholism and drug abuse as illnesses or treatable disorders, and it is NSU's policy to work with members of the NSU community to provide channels of education and assistance. However, it is the individual's responsibility to seek help. NSU also recognizes that the possession and/or use of certain substances are illegal. NSU is further obligated to comply with all local, state, and federal laws. The policy governing the use of alcohol by students at Nova Southeastern University is in compliance with the laws of the state of Florida prohibiting the consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons who are minors (under the age of 21). The policy is based on the use of alcohol in moderation and under appropriate circumstances. The university recognizes that students are adults and are expected to obey the law and take personal responsibility for their own conduct. The laws of the state of Florida prohibit the possession or consumption of alcohol by individuals younger than 21 years of age. 1. The university will not authorize the use of student activity fees or other student funds collected and administered by the university to provide alcoholic beverages for any student event. 2. The sale, delivery, possession, and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages on any property owned and controlled by NSU is strictly prohibited, except as licensed by the state of Florida or otherwise permitted in these regulations. The use of alcoholic beverages on university premises shall be considered a privilege and may be allowed only if consistent with state laws and university regulations, and only when it will not interfere with the decorum and academic atmosphere of the campus. 3. Exception to this prohibition is made for university housing residents of legal drinking age. The possession and use of alcoholic beverages in university housing is governed by the Residential Living Guide. 4. The president, or an appropriate designee, may approve other exceptions to this prohibition, to allow possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons of legal drinking age at designated events and locations on campus. Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 17 5. The use of alcoholic beverages off campus by students of legal drinking age is permissible. However, incidents of intoxication and/or misconduct are subject to university disciplinary action. Students are expected to comply with municipal, state, and federal laws pertaining to the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages. Any violation of these laws may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, probation, suspension, or expulsion from the university. Guidelines for the Use of Alcohol at University Student Events Nova Southeastern University functions, which are student oriented, may serve only beer and wine. All requests for such events must be coordinated through NSU's Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs. Entry fees may be charged, but this fee is only for admission to the event, not for the sale of beer or wine. One-quarter hour before the approved ending time of the event, ticket sales will stop. Any advertisements for the event (including leaflets, invitations, posters, letters, and all other forms of advertisements) cannot advertise alcohol. These advertisements must display the following information: Beverages will be available. Must have valid state-issued picture identification for verification of age. An adequate amount of food and alternative beverages (such as water, juice, assorted sodas, coffee, and teas) must be available throughout the duration of the event. These will be provided at the cost of the organization holding the event. The amount of food and beverages appropriate for the size of the event will be determined when the request for the event is submitted for review/approval. No organization or individual may purchase beer or wine for an event. No other alcohol is permitted. A full-time university employee will be present during an event at which beer and wine are served. If the faculty adviser of the organization is not available, the organization must identify which other university employee will be attending the event. The organizational contact of the event must be present during the entire event as a point of contact for the university. The sponsoring organization is responsible for ensuring that all university policies are strictly obeyed. These guidelines do not override existing university policies; rather, these guidelines should be used in conjunction with any and all other university policies. Appropriate precautionary measures must be in place to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not served to persons under the legal drinking age. These measures include having a designated individual, as deemed by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs, screening people entering the event and attaching a bracelet or stamp indicating those of legal drinking age. At any time during the event, the screening individual has the option to decline identification provided by an individual. The entire staff working the event has the right to refuse service to individuals deemed as having had enough alcohol before or during the event. 18 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook Under no circumstances should anyone be coerced to drink alcohol. All drinking games, contests, or events that encourage excessive drinking are prohibited. The sponsoring organization is responsible for ensuring that all NSU policies and procedures are strictly obeyed. It shall be at the discretion of the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs whether to make arrangements and pay for any security needs necessary based on the specifics of the event and the number of estimated attendees. Violations of these guidelines during the event may result in the closing of the event. All individual violations will be referred to the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs for review. The university can take disciplinary actions as a result of violations of these guidelines. A.2 Appropriate Conduct and Consensual Relationships Policy Sexual relationships between an NSU faculty or staff member or an administrator and a student\u2014who are not married to each other, or who do not have a preexisting analogous relationship\u2014is inappropriate whenever the NSU faculty or staff member or administrator has or will have a professional responsibility for the student in such matters as teaching a course or in otherwise evaluating, supervising, or advising a student as part of a school program. An NSU faculty or staff member or administrator who is closely related to a student by blood or marriage, or who has a preexisting analogous relationship with a student, should eschew roles involving a professional responsibility for the student. See Guidelines for Appropriate Conduct and Ethical Behavior for Employees Policy for full text. A.3 Drug-Free Schools and Campuses In order to comply with the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (Pub. L. No. 101-226, Title 34 C.F.R., part 86), Nova Southeastern University has adopted the following policy for all academic units, campus, and field-based programs. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of illicit drugs* and alcohol are prohibited, in and on, Nova Southeastern University owned or controlled property and as a part of any of its activities. No Nova Southeastern University student shall report to school while under the influence of any illicit drugs or alcohol. The possession of paraphernalia for unlawful drug use is also prohibited. * The term \"illicit drugs\" refers to all illegal drugs and to legal drugs obtained or used without a physician's order. It does not prohibit the use of prescribed medication under the direction of a physician. However, in accordance with federal law, NSU does not permit the possession or use of marijuana on NSU property or during NSU-sponsored activities for any purpose. As such, the possession or use of medical marijuana, even if authorized under state law, is prohibited on NSU property and during NSU-sponsored activities. Any Nova Southeastern University student determined to have violated this policy will be subject to referral for prosecution by the appropriate authorities. Other sanctions include evaluation/treatment for drug use disorder (which may include mandatory completion of a drug/alcohol abuse rehabilitation program) or other university sanctioning up to, and including, expulsion. There are serious health risks associated with the abuse of drugs and alcohol. If you, a fellow student, teacher, or coworker has a problem with abuse of drugs and/or alcohol, help can be provided at programs at NSU and in the community. Additional information is available on the Office of Student Conduct website nova.edu/studentconduct .

The Federal Sentencing Guidelines outline federal penalties for trafficking in drugs. In addition to the federal sanctions, Florida State Statutes provide sanctions in regard to the use, possession, and/or sale of illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol. Punishment varies depending upon the amount and type of drug and/or alcohol involved. Felony convictions range from one year to life imprisonment. Misdemeanor convictions range from less than 60 days to one-year imprisonment. For additional information, please refer to Chapters 316 and 893 of the Florida Statutes , or consult with a legal representative of your choosing. A.4 Health Policies NSU Student Health Insurance Requirement NSU requires all students to carry adequate health insurance coverage. Therefore, all NSU students will automatically be enrolled in the NSU Student Health Insurance Plan, and their student accounts will be charged when they register for classes. Students who reside and take classes outside of the United States are exempt from this requirement. Students who already have health insurance must opt out of the NSU Student Health Insurance Plan each academic year by the given waiver deadline 20 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook for their program. For detailed information, including waiver deadlines, access to the online waiver, NSU Student Health Insurance Plan features, costs, and more, students should visit the Office of the University Bursar website. Immunization Requirements Health Professions Division (HPD) students: See college or program specific policies. All residential (residing in campus housing) students must satisfy the following requirements, if they were born after January 1, 1958. The required documentation of vaccinations shall include the following: Meningococcal meningitis Hepatitis B: You must show proof of one of the following: immunization with three doses of hepatitis B vaccine blood test showing the presence of hepatitis B surface antibody, HPD requires substantiation of immunity Measles (rubella): You must show proof of one of the following: immunization with two doses of measles vaccine, the first given on or after the first birthday, the second given at least 30 days after the first, and BOTH in 1958 or later blood test showing the presence of the measles antibody Rubella: You must show proof of one of the following: one dose of rubella vaccine on or after the first birthday, and in 1969 or later blood test showing the presence of the rubella antibody MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) two doses of the vaccine may be given instead of individual immunizations one dose of the MMR vaccine on or after the first birthday, the second dose must be at least 30 days after the first, and both must be in 1968 or later Influenza Vaccine Exemptions or waivers may be obtained at the university's discretion if the individual is 18 years of age or older, or the individual's parent, if the individual is a minor, declines the vaccinations by signing a separate waiver provided by the institution for each of these vaccines, acknowledging receipt and review of the information provided. Exemptions will not necessarily be accepted by the student's program center. Other students may be subject to the immunization requirements in order to participate in clinical or practicum studies. Students are advised to consult with their program to determine whether the refusal will affect their ability to continue their studies. Immunization requirements are based on Florida state health regulations. Valid exemptions from providing immunity include the following: Medical exemptions\u2014Must produce a signed letter from a doctor, on his or her stationery, stating the reason for exemption and whether it is a temporary or permanent exemption Religious exemptions\u2014On church stationery, signed by a minister, priest, rabbi, or head of church Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 21 Acceptable forms of documentation\u2014The following documents are acceptable proof of immunity of measles and rubella. Forms must include specific dates, and the dates must satisfy the requirements stated previously. HRS (Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services) Childhood immunization records School immunization records Military service records Document indicating blood tests Communicable Diseases Guidelines It is the intent of the university to protect students from communicable diseases that pose reasonable risk of harm to members of the university community. It is also the intent of the university to protect the rights of those infected with a communicable disease. Students who do become infected with a communicable disease must report the contracting of the disease to their program dean and the associate dean of Student Affairs, and are subject to the guidelines listed below. The university will be flexible in its response to incidents of communicable diseases, evaluating each occurrence in light of this policy and current available medical information. NSU will make available to the university community detailed information concerning the transmissibility of communicable diseases and precautions that can be taken to prevent the spread of various communicable diseases. Infected students can continue to study and work as long as they are able to continue to perform regular responsibilities satisfactorily, and as long as the best available medical evidence indicates that their continual status does not present a health or safety threat to themselves or others. An infected student returning to school after a leave of absence for reasons related to a communicable disease must provide a statement from the treating physician indicating current medical status. Students should submit their statement to their program dean or appropriate designee based on the policies of their respective college, academic center, and the associate dean of Student Affairs. Within reason, the university will make arrangements for the infected person, whenever possible, to ensure continuity in the classroom. No infected student may be dismissed from the university solely on the basis of a diagnosis of an infection of a contagious disease. A decision to dismiss or discharge will only be made after appropriate arrangements to assist the student have been attempted, and an examination of facts demonstrates that the infected person can no longer perform essential requirements of the position or program, with or without such arrangements, or poses a reasonable threat to the health and safety of others. In the event that a student has a concern about the potential for the spread of a communicable disease within the university community, those concerns should be brought to the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs for review consistent with the current available information on the spread of the particular communicable disease. After review and evaluation of the concerns, if there appears to be 22 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook a reasonable likelihood of the spread of the disease within the university community by an infected person, the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs will, after notification of the issues presented to the university president, contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or Broward Health Department for recommendations of appropriate action consistent with state law. A.5 Holds on Student Records A Bursar Hold is placed on a student's account on the 30th day of the semester if a balance is still due. The Bursar Hold prevents students from obtaining grades, registering for classes, and accessing the university's RecPlex until the balance is paid in full. Other university entities, such as the Office of the University Registrar and the Office of Student Conduct, may place a hold on a student's account for different reasons. Students must contact the office that initiated the hold(s) to discuss what requirements must be met to have the hold(s) removed. To view their hold(s), students must log in to SharkLink, select \"My Account\" from the navigation, and click \"View Holds.\" A.6 Image Use Statement As part of the Student Enrollment Agreement (SEA), which students are required to read and accept with their first registration each academic year, students are required to agree with the following Image Use Statement: I permit and authorize Nova Southeastern University (NSU) and its employees, agents, representatives, contractors, and personnel who are acting on behalf of NSU to take and/or obtain my photograph, name, alias, video and/or audio recording, or other likeness of myself, or any combination thereof, at any public NSU-related events or at any public areas on NSU's property (hereinafter \"my likeness\"). I further grant NSU permission to utilize my likeness for commercial purposes including publicity, marketing, and promotion for NSU and its programs, without compensation to me, to the extent permissible under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). I understand and consent to NSU copying, reproducing, and distributing my likeness in any media format. I further understand that my likeness may be subject to reasonable modification and/or editing and waive any right to inspect or approve the finished product or material in which NSU may eventually use my likeness. I acknowledge that NSU owns all rights to my likeness and understand that, although NSU will endeavor to use my likeness in accordance with standards of good judgment, NSU cannot warrant or guarantee that any further dissemination of my likeness will be subject to NSU's supervision or control. Accordingly, I release NSU from any and all liability related to the use, dissemination, reproduction, distribution, and/or display of my likeness in any media format, and any alteration, distortion, or illusionary effect of my likeness, whether intentional or otherwise, in connection with said use. I also understand that I may not withdraw my permission for use of my likeness which was granted. A.7 Indebtedness to the University NSU offers to all students\u2014on campus, online, clinical, or hybrid\u2014the same quality education and many opportunities for student benefits depending on the student's choice of educational modality. Therefore, the university sets the overall student fees on an aggregate, student-centric basis for the entire student body. The overall costs exceed the amount collected from student fees charged to all students. These student fees are blended together to create 1NSU with high-tech systems, student activities, and many other essential student services that make a complete, integrated university. This mission Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 23 transcends the development and ultimate determination of the amount of student fees for all students, irrespective of their choice of learning modality. By registering for courses at Nova Southeastern University, the student accepts financial responsibility for payment of all institutional costs including, but not limited to, tuition, fees, housing, health insurance, and meal plan (if applicable), and any additional costs when those charges become due. Payment is due in full at the time of registration. NSU e bills are sent the middle of each month to the student's NSU email address. However, to avoid late charges, students should not wait for their billing statement to pay their tuition and fees. A student will not be able to register for future semesters until all outstanding balances from previous semesters have been paid in full. If a student has a balance 30 days after the start of the semester, a hold and a $100 late fee will be placed on his or her account. This hold stops all student services, including, but not limited to, access to the NSU RecPlex, academic credentials, grades, and future registrations. It will remain on the student's account until the balance has been paid in full. Delinquent student account balances may be reported to a credit bureau and referred to collection agencies or litigated.

In the event of a change of residence from on-campus housing to an off-campus location, a student should notify the Office of the University Registrar of the new address. A.11 Student Organization Rights and Responsibilities All Nova Southeastern University students who pay the student activities fee are eligible to join university organizations. Student organizations must be registered with the Office of Campus Life and Student Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 25 Engagement each year in order to be considered a student organization with rights and privileges on campus, including the reservation and/or use of university facilities. Information on establishing any other type of student organization or maintaining a current one can be obtained by contacting the Office of Campus Life and Student Engagement at the Don Taft University Center, or online at nova.edu /campuslife/organizations/registration.html . With the exception of fraternities and sororities, the Office of Campus Life and Student Engagement grants final approval for the creation of student organizations. All student organizations are under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Office of Student Conduct. All student organizations and groups are subject to the rules and policies of Nova Southeastern University, including, but not limited to, the NSU Student Handbook and the Policies and Procedures for Student Organizations .

It applies to all users of the university's computing resources including 26 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook students, faculty and staff members, alumni, and guests of the university. Computing resources include all computers, related equipment, software, data, local area networks, and listservs for which the university is responsible, as well as networks throughout the world to which the university provides computer access. The computing resources of Nova Southeastern University are intended to be used for its programs of instruction and research and to conduct the legitimate business of the university. All users must have proper authorization for the use of the university's computing resources. Users are responsible for seeing that these computing resources are used in an effective, ethical, and legal manner. Users must apply standards of normal academic and professional ethics and considerate conduct to their use of the university's computing resources. Users must be aware of the legal and moral responsibility for ethical conduct in the use of computing resources. Users have a responsibility not to abuse the network and resources, and to respect the privacy, copyrights, and intellectual property rights of others. In addition to the policy contained herein, usage must be in accordance with applicable university policies (see related policies listed at the end of this section) and applicable state and federal laws. Among the more important laws are the Florida Computer Crimes Act, the Federal Computer Abuse Amendment Act 1994, the Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and the U.S. Copyright Act. Copies of these laws and the NSU copyright policy may be examined in the Office of Academic Affairs. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, including unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing, may subject the student to civil and criminal liabilities. Policy violations generally fall into five categories that involve the use of computing resources: 1. for purposes other than the university's programs of instruction and research and the legitimate business of the university 2. to harass, threaten, discriminate, stalk, intimidate, or otherwise cause harm or attempt to cause harm to specific individuals or classes of individuals 3. to impede, interfere with, impair, or otherwise cause harm to the activities of others 4. to download, post, or install to university computers, or transport across university networks, material that is illegal, proprietary, in violation of license agreements, in violation of copyrights, in violation of university contracts, or otherwise damaging to the institution 5. to recklessly, willfully, negligently, or maliciously interfere with or damage NSU computer or network resources or computer data, files, or other information Examples (not a comprehensive list) of policy violations related to the above five categories include: using computer resources for personal reasons using computer resources to invade the privacy of another sending email on matters not concerning the legitimate business of the university sending an individual or group repeated and unwanted (harassing) email or using email to threaten someone accessing, or attempting to access, another individual's data or information without proper authorization (e.g. using another's computing account and password to look at personal information) Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 27 creating a false email address propagating electronic mail chain, pyramid schemes, or sending forged or falsified email obtaining, possessing, using, or attempting to use someone else's password regardless of how the password was obtained copying a graphical image from a website without permission posting a university site-licensed program to a public bulletin board using illegally obtained licensed data/software, or using licensed data/software in violation of their licenses or purchase agreements releasing or threatening to release a virus, worm, or other program that damages or otherwise harms a system, network, or data preventing others from accessing services attempting to tamper with or obstruct the operation of NSU's computer systems or networks using or attempting to use NSU's computer systems or networks as a means for the unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data outside the university improper peer-to-peer file sharing viewing, distributing, downloading, posting, or transporting child or any pornography via the web, including sexually explicit material for personal use that is not required for educational purposes using university resources for unauthorized purposes (e.g. using personal computers connected to the campus network to set up web servers for illegal, commercial, or profit-making purposes) violating federal copyright, intellectual property, and/or trademark laws or the NSU copyright, intellectual property, and/or policy Inappropriate conduct and violations of this policy will be addressed by the appropriate procedures and agents (e.g., the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs or the Office of Human Resources) depending on the individual's affiliation to the university. In cases where a user violates any of the terms of this policy, the university may, in addition to other remedies, temporarily or permanently deny access to any and all NSU computing resources, and appropriate disciplinary actions may be taken, up to, and including, dismissal. Enterprise Username and Password Policy Policy Rationale Nova Southeastern University's (NSU) network and information systems provide the technical foundation for conduct of its academic, research, and administrative missions. Providing this open access to information technology is imperative to ensuring academic freedom at the institution. An important part of providing this network access is ensuring that the network and associated information is secure. 28 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance to faculty, staff, students, and other authorized users regarding usernames and passwords in order to protect individual and university information and resources. Adherence to this policy will help ensure that the university network and information systems are standardized, secure, and available to all. Policy Statement Usernames must be assigned to each individual user to access any NSU network. Generic usernames may only be used in circumstances where they are deemed appropriate by the chief information security officer. Passwords must meet the minimum standards set by the chief information security officer and, if possible, applications and devices providing access to technical resources must technically enforce them. Faculty, staff, vendors, and students must adhere to the standards for all systems and applications that come into contact with university technical resources. Remedies The university reserves the right to suspend access to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the network, systems or information periodically audit passwords for compliance pursue disciplinary action because of non-compliance Electronic Mail Communications NSU requires students and faculty and staff members to hold and maintain one official university computer account that is used to access major computing resources, including electronic mail. These university-assigned computer accounts correspond directly to NSU email addresses (see the following). All official electronic mail communications directed to NSU students and faculty and staff members will be sent exclusively to NSU-assigned computer accounts to ensure timely and accurate delivery of information. All email communications between students and faculty, staff, and administration must be sent from the student's official NSU email account to the official NSU email account of the member of the faculty, staff, or administration.

Hazing does not include customary athletic events or other similar contests or competitions or any activity or conduct that furthers legal and legitimate objective. (Florida Hazing Law, 1006.63) Engaging in, supporting, promoting, or sponsoring hazing or violating university rules governing hazing is prohibited. B.23 Health and Safety Nova Southeastern University recognizes that certain life-threatening behavior (e.g., suicide threats, gestures, or attempts; eating disorders; substance abuse; threats, gestures, or attempts to harm others) is a sign of personal distress. The university is committed to helping students alleviate whatever stress factors are precipitating life-threatening behavior by providing support and/or referral through use of appropriate resources. However, since it is critically important to maintain civility and respect for all members of the university community, it is recognized that action must be taken when such behavior is considered by the university to be disruptive to and unacceptable in the academic and social/living environment. The determination of a student's participation and progress is to be made by the Student Behavioral Concerns Committee. NSU reserves the right to require the withdrawal of a student whose continuation in school, in the university's judgment, is detrimental to the health or safety of the student or others. Generally, a student who is required to withdraw from the university for behavior detrimental to the health or safety of the student or others may not be allowed to return until documentation is provided by a treating medical provider of readiness to return. Additionally, a secondary evaluation/assessment must be conducted by the medical professionals of the Center for Student Counseling and Well-Being or an alternative health care provider of the university's choosing. Action taken under the University Health and Safety policy does not preclude disciplinary action by NSU. Students who withdraw for reasons of health or safety must contact the Office of Student Conduct before seeking readmission to the university. B.24 Identification Cards University identification cards (SharkCards) may only be used by the student whose name appears on the card.

In an effort to foster and provide an environment free from bias or prejudice for the parties involved, publication (verbal or written communication) regarding any university investigatory, administrative, disciplinary, or judicial proceeding is prohibited, if the publication is deemed by the appropriate official overseeing the proceeding to compromise the impartiality and integrity of the proceeding. This does not prohibit the student from filing a grievance or complaint as provided in this handbook or through any outside governmental agency. Communication related to the proceeding will be limited to identified individuals using administrative discretion.

Hostile Environment D. University Disciplinary Procedures D.1 Introduction A student (or student organization) who is alleged to have violated policies of the NSU Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and/or any other university policies and procedures (other than the University Sexual Misconduct Policy) may be charged under the NSU Student Disciplinary process. A complaint may be made by any member of the university and/or nonuniversity community. The process through which students (or the student organization) are held accountable to university policies and procedures is intended to promote a better understanding of the university community and acceptable behavior for students who are a part of that community. With that in mind, it should be noted that the following processes occur only between the university and each individual student involved in an investigation into possible violations. Parents, friends, significant others, and/or attorneys are not permitted to participate in, or observe, the disciplinary process. Upon notification that a violation may have occurred, the assistant dean for Student Development and/ or designee, will investigate the circumstances of the case using the following process: The following figure illustrates the University Disciplinary Process for Individual Students (not used for University Sexual Misconduct Cases\u2014please refer to Section D.4):42 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook Reported Incident Investigation Sanctioning Sanctioning Appeal Appeal Upheld Upheld Denied DeniedNo Violation(s) When it is determined that no policies have been violated, the student is not charged and the case is closed. File retained. Administrative Judicial Conference Violations do not lead to suspension, dismissal, or expulsion. Not Responsible When determined no policies have been violated, case is closed. File retained.Not Responsible When determined no policies have been violated, case is closed. File retained.Responsible When determined policies have been violated.Responsible When determined policies have been violated.Violation(s) When it is determined that there is reasonable cause to believe policy violations have occurred, charges are clearly outlined and they are delivered in writing to the student. Administrative Judicial Hearing Violations may lead to suspension, dismissal, or expulsion. Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 43 Personal Rights of a Student (or Student Organization) during the Discipline Process a. Right to abstain from verbal participation\u2014Students are not required to share their version of the incident in question, but must understand that their nonparticipation will not preclude a discipline officer from making a decision on charges or responsibility. b. Right to review related information and question witnesses, and provide the same on his or her own behalf. c. Right to an adviser\u2014For any alleged violation that will impact student enrollment status, students may choose to seek out an adviser. That individual may be present with the student during all meetings and/or hearings. An adviser must be either a full-time member of the university staff or faculty. The adviser should be someone who understands the policies and procedures used in the student discipline process. An adviser may not \"represent\" a student or speak for him or her at any point. Rather, an adviser may be present to answer questions the involved student poses directly to the adviser. Regardless of whether a student chooses to utilize an adviser or not, every effort will be made by the discipline officer adjudicating the process to answer any questions a student may have before or after any meetings or hearings. Adjudication Process Notification Communication of the alleged violations will be provided to a student via his or her NSU provided email. Notices to student organizations will be sent via NSU email to the president of the organization. Notices of alleged violations will include the following: the university conduct/academic responsibility standard(s) alleged to have been violated and sufficient details of the complaint for the basis of the allegation to be understood a statement of the respondent student's rights the name of the person(s), group, or university office filing the complaint a request to schedule a conference/hearing within five business days For any graduate or professional student who is alleged to have violated the Code of Student Conduct, a copy of the notification of charges will be provided to the dean's office of the student's college. A student and/or organization that is alleged to have violated the Code of Student Conduct shall have the matter adjudicated by either an administrative conference or hearing, based on the alleged violations. Every effort will be made to have the accused student and/or organization misconduct considered expeditiously. If a student withdraws from the university or is no longer an active student, the university may, at its discretion, continue through the disciplinary process without the student's participation, or place the disciplinary process on hold until the student's attempted return to NSU. Students are not permitted to reenter NSU until all outstanding disciplinary cases are resolved.44 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook D.2 Judicial Conference A judicial conference is a meeting related to violation(s) that could not result in suspension, dismissal, or expulsion from the university. Conference Procedures Following notification of charges, the accused student must schedule a conference meeting with the designated discipline officer. If a student does not respond to a request to schedule a conference, the university reserves the right to continue its disciplinary procedure, conducting an in absentia conference. In addition, holds may be placed on a student's account that restrict registration for future semesters. The conference is for the purpose of discussing the alleged violation(s) of the Code of Student Conduct. The conference meeting will only be open to the accused student and the discipline officer. The accused student and/or organization is presumed not responsible unless the student and/or organization accepts responsibility, or determined responsible for the alleged violation(s) based on the preponderance of the evidence. At the beginning of the conversation, the discipline officer will review with the accused student his or her rights in the process as aforementioned, as well as the alleged violations. The student will have the opportunity to provide a response to the allegations (responsible or not responsible). If the student accepts responsibility, the only determination the discipline officer makes is regarding the sanctions to be imposed. If the student responds with \"not responsible,\" the student will be provided the opportunity to provide evidence, a witness, or information for the review of the discipline officer. Any witnesses requested shall be present only during the offerings of their information. Witnesses must be able to provide firsthand, relevant information regarding the case. Character witnesses are not accepted. In Absentia\u2014If the student and/or organization fails to schedule\u2014or appear for\u2014a scheduled conference, and the discipline officer has, in good faith, exhausted all reasonable efforts to schedule the meeting, the discipline officer may make a determination based on the information available. If the student is found responsible, the officer may impose sanctions. This decision shall be communicated in writing to the student and/or organization via NSU email. At the conclusion of the conference, the student and/or organization will receive a written statement as to the disposition of the case, with information regarding each violation alleged. For any graduate or professional student, a copy of the final disposition will be provided to the dean's office of the student's college. Sanctions If, following a judicial conference, the student and/or organization is found in violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility, the discipline officer will decide on the sanction to be imposed. One or more of the following sanctions may be imposed for violations: Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 45 Final Disciplinary Probation is a disciplinary sanction serving notice to a student that his or her behavior is in flagrant violation of university standards, under which the following conditions exist: a.

After two semesters in attendance, a student may initiate a request in writing for reduction of the sanction to Disciplinary Probation, but must also demonstrate reason to substantiate the request. b. Another violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will result in the minimum of suspension being imposed if the student is found in violation. Disciplinary Probation is a disciplinary sanction serving notice to a student that his or her behavior is in serious violation of university standards. A time period is indicated, during which another violation to the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will automatically raise the question of a more severe sanction (suspension or expulsion), if the student is found in violation. Disciplinary Warning is a disciplinary sanction serving notice to a student that his or her behavior has not met university standards. This sanction remains in effect for a designated number of semesters of attendance. Verbal Warning is a verbal admonition to the student by a university staff member that his or her behavior is inappropriate.

When appealing a judicial decision, the appeal must fall into one of the following categories: The student has new, relevant evidence that was not available during the investigation or adjudication that would substantially alter the outcome of the case. Information that the applicable university procedures were not followed and the deviance would substantially alter the outcome. The sanction(s) do not relate appropriately to the violation. Appeals shall be heard by designated appeal officers. The appellate officer shall not be the same conduct/discipline officer that heard the original case. D.3 Judicial Hearing A Judicial Hearing is a hearing conducted for violation(s) that could result in suspension, dismissal, or expulsion. Hearing Procedures Following notification of charges, the accused student must schedule a hearing with the designated discipline officer. If a student does not respond to a request to schedule a hearing, the university reserves the right to continue its disciplinary procedure, conducting an in absentia hearing.

The hearing is for the purpose of discussing the alleged violation(s) of the Code of Student Conduct. The hearing will only be open to the accused student, his or her adviser (should the student choose to have one), the discipline officer, and a \"recorder.\" All hearings will be digitally recorded. An individual \"recorder\" will be present during the hearing to ensure this process. The individual has no other role in the hearing. The recording will be used only for the appellate process. The record will be the property of the university. The accused student and/or organization is presumed not responsible unless the student and/or organization accepts responsibility, or are determined responsible for the alleged violation(s) based on the preponderance of the evidence. At the beginning of the conversation, the discipline officer will review with the accused student/ organization their rights in the process as outlined before, as well as the alleged code violations. The student will have the opportunity to provide a response to the allegations (responsible or not responsible). If the student accepts responsibility, the only determination the discipline officer makes is regarding the sanctions to be imposed. If the student responds with \"not responsible,\" the student will be provided with the opportunity to present evidence, a witness, or information for the review of the discipline officer. Any witnesses requested shall be present only during the offerings of their information. Witnesses must be able to provide firsthand, relevant information regarding the case.

Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 49 D.4 University Title IX/Sexual Misconduct Disciplinary Procedures All reports of sexual misconduct are subject to the Title IX/Sexual Misconduct Policy and accompanying procedures, which describes when a report may be referred to the University Disciplinary Procedures in this code. Any questions about the Title IX/Sexual Misconduct Policy and related procedures may be addressed to the Title IX coordinator. E. Additional Grievance Procedures Available E.1 Grievance Procedure for Discrimination Based on Disability Disability discrimination can occur whenever a qualified individual with a disability is denied the same equal opportunities as other university students, faculty and staff members, and third parties, because of their disability status. Under applicable disability laws, an individual with a disability is a person who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. Temporary, nonchronic impairments that do not last for a long time and that have little or no long-term impact usually are not disabilities. The determination of whether an impairment is a disability is made on a case-by-case basis. a. What is a \"major life activity\" under the law? To be considered a person with a disability, the impairment must substantially limit one or more major life activities. Examples of major life activities include walking, speaking, breathing, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, learning, and caring for oneself. b. What does \"qualified\" mean? To be protected, a person must not only be an individual with a disability, but must be qualified. For students, a qualified individual with a disability is a person who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies or practices; the removal of architectural, communication or transportation barriers; or the provision of auxiliary aids or services, meets the essential requirements for the receipt of services or participation in programs or activities provided by the university. For university employees, a qualified individual with a disability is a person who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position and who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position. c. Disability Harassment Harassment on the basis of an actual or perceived disability is also a form of prohibited discrimination. Disability harassment consists of unwelcome verbal, written, or physical conduct based on disability, when such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the individual's work or educational performance such conduct creates or has the intention of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working and/or learning environment such conduct unreasonably interferes with or limits one's ability to participate in or benefit from an educational program or activity50 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook d. Hostile Environment The university will not tolerate the creation or existence of an environment that is hostile on the basis of disability as detailed in the NSU Nondiscrimination Statement. Such a hostile environment is defined as harassing conduct (e.g., physical, verbal, graphic, or written) related to an individual's disability that is sufficiently severe, pervasive or persistent so as (1) to interfere with or limit the ability of an individual to participate in or benefit from the university's programs and activities or (2) to unreasonably interfere with an individual's work or academic performance by creating an objectively intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or learning environment. Whether the harassing conduct is considered severe, persistent, or pervasive depends upon the context in which the behavior occurred. Grievance Procedures for Complaints of Disability Discrimination a. Filing a Complaint A formal complaint is one way of initiating a full, formal investigation. Formal complaints may be made by students, faculty and staff members, other NSU employees, or third parties (i.e., an individual who is not a student, faculty member, or employee of NSU). A formal complaint must be written* and must provide detailed allegations of the alleged disability discrimination. The purpose of this policy is to provide for the prompt, adequate, and impartial investigation of all complaints of disability discrimination and/or disability-based harassment. The following person has been designated to handle inquiries and complaints by students regarding perceived disability discrimination: Michelle Manley, Ph.D. Assistant Dean for Student Development (954) 262-7281 mmichell@nova.edu The assistant dean for Student Development will be responsible for coordinating the investigation and making a determination as to any potential behaviors/activities which may violate the university's disability discrimination/harassment policies. Any complaint relating to disability harassment or discrimination made by a student against faculty or staff members may be referred to the NSU Office of Human Resources (OHR) where appropriate, at the discretion of the assistant dean for Student Development. Any complaints referred to the NSU Office of Human Resources will be investigated and processed to conclusion, in accordance with the policies contained in the Faculty Policy Manual or Employee Policy Manual and the grievance procedures contained therein. Any complaint relating to a disability accommodation decision must be filed in accordance with the policies as outlined in the Office of Disability Services website. The appeals process, as well as additional information, can be found at nova.edu/disabilityservices . * NSU also will accept oral complaints from individuals with disabilities, if, due to their disability, they are unable to file a written complaint. The university will memorialize the individual's complaint in writing and the individual will certify that the written complaint is an accurate representation of his or her complaint. Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 51 b. Referral or Dismissal of Reports Some complaints may not actually fall within the definition of discrimination set forth by university policy or otherwise may be more appropriately handled by other offices. These reports will be dismissed or referred to other offices as appropriate. c. Initial Processing of Student Complaints by the Assistant Dean for Student Development Upon filing of a formal complaint with the assistant dean for Student Development, an investigator will be appointed from the appropriate university college, office, and/or department, who will meet with the complainant within five business days to document the allegations, based on the written complaint and any other information gathered. The allegations made by the complainant will be the basis for the investigation. d. Informal/Early Resolution of Student Complaints The university may attempt to resolve matters through mediation or other alternative resolution, when appropriate. Mediation will not be used for reports of extreme forms of disability discrimination or harassment. In mediation, the investigator\u2014or an assigned individual\u2014typically meets with the reporting party and the respondent\u2014separately and/or together\u2014to seek an acceptable resolution. Any informal resolution may be made only with the agreement of all affected parties. If alternative resolution is unsuccessful, the matter will proceed to investigation. e. Investigation Process of Student Complaints Processed by the Assistant Dean for Student Development Grievance investigations are objective, fact-finding inquiries. The purpose of the investigation is to gather facts relating to the allegations made by the complainant and to enable the assistant dean for Student Development to decide whether NSU policy has been violated. The investigation will include interviews with the complainant, respondent, and any other witnesses deemed to potentially have relevant information. Both complainant and respondent may identify witnesses who can provide information relevant to the allegations, but the investigator determines which witnesses will be interviewed. Complainant and respondent are always permitted to present written statements from witnesses for the investigator's consideration during the investigation process. The investigation may include written statements, interviews, document requests, and any other sources the investigator deems appropriate. The complainant and respondent are permitted to provide the investigator with evidence. The investigator will provide the respondent with written notice of the allegations, if appropriate, and allow the respondent five business days to respond, in writing. Investigations may be expanded to address additional allegations that surface during the investigation, at the investigator's discretion. If appropriate, the respondent will be provided with written notice of any such additional allegations. The respondent will be given the opportunity to respond to the additional allegations. The investigator typically will complete the investigation within 90 calendar days of the date the report was filed. Should additional time be required to complete the investigation, the investigator will provide written notification to the parties detailing the reason(s) additional time is necessary.52 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook Parties and witnesses are expected to speak for themselves during the investigation; attorneys are not permitted to be present during university interviews or meetings in the course of an investigation or resolution of a report. f. Investigation Completion of Student Complaints Processed by the Assistant Dean for Student Development At the conclusion of the investigation, the investigator(s) will prepare a written report. The report typically will summarize the allegations investigated, and describe the relevant information discovered and factual findings made, including whether any allegations were substantiated, and the basis for such findings, which may include credibility as determined in the investigator's judgment. The report will not make findings as to whether there has been a violation of law or university policy. The investigator will indicate any facts or allegations in dispute, and present his or her conclusions (if any) about such facts, including the basis for such conclusions (e.g., whether an allegation was corroborated by witnesses, or whether the investigator found one version of events more credible than another). The investigator will provide the investigation report, the written complaint, the response, and any other information deemed necessary to the assistant dean for Student Development. Within 10 business days of receipt of the investigation report, the assistant dean for Student Development will make a determination of whether a policy violation occurred. (See Section G for a description of the possible determinations.) g. Determinations by the Assistant Dean for Student Development The following is a description of the potential determinations made by the assistant dean for Student Development upon the conclusion of the investigation process: 1. Determination of No Violation of University Discrimination Policy by the Assistant Dean for Student Development. If the assistant dean for Student Development determines that a violation of the university's discrimination policy has not been shown, all parties will be so informed and the matter closed. The assistant dean for Student Development will provide the complainant with an explanation of the key findings on which the determination is based. If the investigation reveals evidence or allegations of violations of other university policies or other misconduct by the respondent or other parties, the investigator will present, typically in a separate report, such evidence or allegations to the assistant dean for Student Development to pursue as deemed appropriate. 2. Determination of Violation of the University's Discrimination Policy by the Assistant Dean for Student Development. If the assistant dean for Student Development determines that there was a violation of NSU policy, he or she will inform the respondent of such determination along with the findings upon which the determination is based. The respondent will be given the opportunity to respond to the determination in writing. Any response must be received by the assistant dean for Student Development within five business days of the determination. The assistant dean for Student Development will consider any such response, and may modify his or her determination if appropriate. If it is determined that a violation of NSU policy has occurred, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken in accordance with published policies. Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook 53 h. Notification of Outcome by the Assistant Dean for Student Development After a final determination is made, the assistant dean for Student Development will contemporaneously provide written notification to the complainant and respondent informing them that the investigation is complete and whether a violation of university policy was determined to have occurred. 1. Notification to Complainant If a violation of university policy was determined to have occurred, the notification will include assurances that appropriate corrective action will be taken and advise the complainant to immediately report any conduct that he or she believes was/is retaliatory. 2. Notification to Respondent If a violation of university policy was determined to have occurred, the notification will detail the disciplinary action to be taken and advise that retaliation will not be tolerated, and any such behavior could potentially subject anyone engaged in retaliation to additional disciplinary action. The notification will also detail the policies and procedures associated with appealing the decision. i. Appeals Under certain circumstances and depending on their status as a student, employee or faculty member, parties may have the right to an appeal within the university. An appeal of disciplinary action taken against a student by the assistant dean for Student Development must be made in writing to the vice president of Student Affairs within five business days of the receipt of the written notification of outcome. In appealing a disciplinary decision, the appeal must fall into one of the following categories: The student has new, relevant evidence that was not available during the investigation or adjudication that would substantially alter the outcome of the case. Information that the applicable university procedures were not followed and the deviance would substantially alter the outcome. The sanction(s) do not relate appropriately to the violation(s). A written decision will be provided by the vice president of Student Affairs, or his or her designee, within a reasonable amount of time from receipt of the appeal request. The decision of the vice president of Student Affairs, or his or her designee, will be final. If the complainant is suspended, dismissed, or expelled from the university, the assistant dean for Student Development sends written notification of the action to the dean of the student's academic program and appropriate university administrative offices. An appeal of disciplinary action taken against an employee will be conducted in accordance with the NSU Employee Policy Manual or Faculty Policy Manual , if available. j. Remediating Disability Discrimination Disability discrimination and/or harassment are not tolerated at NSU. The university is committed to taking necessary remedial steps that are designed to stop the discrimination, correct its effects, and ensure that the discrimination does not recur. Such actions may or may not be the action that the reporting party 54 Nova Southeastern University Student Handbook requests or prefers. Steps may be specific to the parties involved or may be aimed at a broader group. Typical steps range from counseling (which may be either remedial counseling, for the respondent, or supportive counseling, for the reporting party) or training or separation of the parties, to discipline of the respondent, including a written warning, probation, suspension, demotion, transfer, expulsion, or termination for cause. The appropriate discipline will depend on the nature and severity of the conduct, the respondent's overall record, the applicable policy on discipline, and other factors where relevant. k. Retaliation The law prohibits retaliation against an individual for opposing any practices forbidden under this policy, for bringing a complaint of discrimination or harassment, for assisting someone with such a complaint, for attempting to stop such discrimination or harassment, or for participating in any manner in any investigation or resolution of a complaint of discrimination or harassment. NSU will immediately investigate and remedy (if appropriate) any reported retaliatory actions taken by the respondent or other individuals. E.2 Nonacademic Grievance Procedure Except for grievances and/or complaints involving sexual misconduct, discrimination, and disability accommodations, this process should be followed for all nonacademic grievances of policies/procedures that are not governed by a specific academic center, program, college, or school. Academic grievances should be referred to the student's academic center. The purpose of these grievance procedures is to promote the orderly resolution of problems arising out of a student complaint concerning a policy, procedure, or administrative action of Nova Southeastern University. Grievances can often be adversarial, unpleasant, and unsatisfying, so we recommend that students discuss problems before resorting to the formal grievance steps. When formal grievance steps are perceived as necessary, students have a right to a fair process and hearing without retribution. 1. First, the student should attempt to resolve an issue in dispute at the level at which the dispute occurred. This attempt must be in writing (i.e., email, regular mail, or fax). The student may wish to use certified mail to verify receipt of the correspondence. In the correspondence, the student must present a rationale for his or her position based on factual information. 2. The student will receive a reply, in writing, which addresses the complaint. 3. If the reply is not acceptable, the student is encouraged to submit the complaint in writing to the assistant dean for Student Development. The assistant dean will attempt to resolve the dispute. 4. If the assistant dean for Student Development is unable to resolve the dispute, he or she will notify the student and the vice president of Student Affairs, in writing. 5. The student may then appeal, in writing, to the vice president of Student Affairs. 6. The vice president will investigate and review the findings, and will notify the student, in writing, of his or her decision. 7. The vice president's decision is final and binding and cannot be appealed.
