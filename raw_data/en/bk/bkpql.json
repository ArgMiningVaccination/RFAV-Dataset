Hormones are chemical messengers that send instructions to the various organ systems in order to regulate vital bodily functions. A high stress lifestyle combined with poor eating habits can wreak havoc on a women's delicately balanced hormonal function. Even healthy women with a good diet can end up with hormones unbalanced. Symptoms of hormonal imbalance may include PMS, uterine fibroids, osteoporosis, reduced sex drive, allergies,weight gain, changes in the skin, fatigue, water retention, hair loss, facial hair growth and sometimes anxiety and depression. A naturopath takes time to review a patient's medical history in detail and tailor a herbal mix and provide dietary and lifestyle advice specific to the patient. Below are some suggested tips and a selection of herbs for treating hormonal imbalances. Top Five Tips for Rebalancing Hormones Maintain a healthy diet. Incorporate fresh, organic fruits and vegetables, plus raw nuts and seeds into your diet. Avoid high fatty foods, processed carbohydrates, fried foods, soft drinks, enriched flour, and processed vegetable oil. Avoid non-organic dairy products, which may contain harmful bovine growth hormones, steroids and antibiotics. Add more Omega-3 fatty acids to your diet. These fats create healthy cell membranes, allowing hormones to bind to the cell more easily. Omega-3 fatty acids also repair receptor sites (where hormones bind) and keep it in optimal condition. Consider eating more foods with omega-3s (fish, chia seeds, nuts) or taking a high quality organic oil, such as hempseed or flaxseed. Keep stress levels down. Studies show that women who mediate daily or practice yoga experience less hormonal swings than those who don't. Rest is important. Many women lead such hectic lives with many demands placed on them that they have little time to let their bodies re-adjust. Find small ways and time to relax. A massage can be a wonderful way to relax and remove the aches and pains caused by a busy lifestyle. Get enough good quality sleep. Try to get at least 8 hours every night. During sleep the body recuperates and restores. Insufficient sleep is now recognised as a major cause heart disease, stroke, metabolic dysfunction and impaired mental health. Start the day with some exercise. A workout can be anything from a brisk walk, a swim, and a visit to the gym or some exercises at home. Exercise improves your circulation, raises your heartbeat, and brings oxygen and vital nutrients to your organs.If you do this for at least 20 minutes first thing in the morning you will feel that you have more energy to carry on with your day and it will help stabalise your hormones.
