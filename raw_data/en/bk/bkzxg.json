BACKGROUND 1. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) situation a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.1 The first case of COVID-19 in Nepal was detected on 27 January 2020, and the number of cases started increasing from the t hird week of March 2020. A total of 591,494 cases have been confirmed and 7, 990 people have died from the virus as of 7 June 2021.2 The Government of Nepal has decided to vaccinate target populations t o reduce transmission of the disease and expedite recovery from the pandemic's impact . Accordingly, i t has applied to the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility, which is co-led by the GAVI , The Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and WHO, for COVID-19 vaccine support for 20% of its population, with an intent to receive vaccines beyond the prioritized 20% if available through the COVAX facility. 2. The Ministry of Health and Population (MO HP) has developed a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 Vaccines (NDVP) . The NDVP provides prioritization criteria for vaccination and guides the country's vaccination allocation plan. It also presents the country's plans to deploy potential COVID-19 vaccines and implement and monitor the nation -wide mass COVID-19 vaccination. It outlines the country' s medical waste management plan to manage incremental immunization waste due to the COVID-19 vaccination . The task of implementing COVID-19 vaccines has been given to the Nation al Immunization Programme, a well-established program in the MOHP. A National COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Committee has be en established to guide all aspects of COVID-19 vaccine introduction in Nepal, including reg ulatory guidance on vaccine access, vaccine selection, equitable distribution of vaccine, procurement, financing , delivery mechanisms, prioritization of population groups, vaccine safety surveillance, communication, media response, etc. The government has formed task forces and committ ees across the federal, provincial, district, and local levels to facilitate the implementatio n of COVID- 19 vaccination. The roles and responsibilities of each committee have been clearly de fined to streamline their functioning. The Governor's letter (Annex I) confirms the government' s commitment to implement its COVID-19 vaccination allocation plan and its com pliance with policies and regulations on managing medical waste from the immunization against COVID-19 as indicated in the NDVP. II. PRIORITIZATION 3. The impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic is not shared among the entire population equally. The Government of Nepal has developed a prioritization strategy (Table 1) for vacci ne deployment based on the values framework and road map for vaccine prioritization guidance developed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization of WHO, 3 as well as the country context and disease epidemiology in the country. The phased plan with identified pr iority groups and approximate target populations has been mapped out in the NDVP by the government's National COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Committee. The Council of Mi nisters of Nepal has also endorsed it. As on 7 June 2021, roughly 2,113,080 individuals have been admi nistered the first dose of the COVID- 19 vaccine and 691,494 have received the second dose. 1 WHO. 2020.

Sources: Consultation with development partners and the Gove rnment and National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 Vaccination and Ministry of Health and Population. 4. According to the NDVP, the above-given prioritization of beneficiaries for COVID-19 vaccination may be updated based on various factors, including: (i) Evolving epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in the country. (ii) Number of vaccine doses that would be available at each time, for which the prioritization or the phases may need to be further broken down or clubbed based on dose availability. (a) Within the 'occupational' targeted group, those with a higher risk of exposure due to their work and involved with higher risk or vulnerable group and principle of reciprocity will be applied if fewer vaccine doses are available in one tranche. 3 (b) Within the targeted group by 'age ,' since epidemiological data shows a higher case fatality rate for increasing age, those in the higher age groups will be prioritized if fewer vaccine doses are available in one tranche. (iii) Type of vaccine available including its safety, efficacy, and possible allergic reaction to vaccine or any of its components, such as for special population (e.g ., pregnancy) and age groups (e.g ., children and adolescents, elderly). 5. Pregnant and lactating mothers, and children below a specific year (as per the available vaccine's age cutoff) will not be given the COVID-19 vaccine unless there i s a specific recommendation for the available vaccines as per the risk-benefit situation. 6. The Asian Development Bank ( ADB) considers the proposed prioritization of vaccine access indicated in the NDVP consistent with international norms and safeguards agai nst the exclusion of marginalized and vulnerable groups. III. MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN 7. The Government of Nepal has legislation, policies, and guidelines for health care was te management (HCWM) to treat and dispose of infectious waste from health car e facilities. The Health Coordination Division and Health Emergency and Disaster Management Unit o f the MOHP are directly related to health assurance and are responsible for medical waste man agement. The Management Division of the Department of Health Services (DOHS) has the Environmental Health and Waste Management Section. The Curative Service Division, DOHS, w ill be responsible for supervising environment safeguards, including hospital waste and bio -safety procedures in hospitals. The Solid Waste Management Technical Support Center under the Ministry of Urban Development provides technical support to all local bodies for effective and sustainable waste management and advance research and development. Upon federalization, the local governments are responsible for managing the waste generated. 8. The government recognizes that the COVID-19 vaccination will result in a signifi cant temporary increase in medical and health care waste generation at the vaccination sites. Therefore, it has committed in the NDVP that HCWM will be a budgeted activity for COVID- 19 vaccine delivery for all implementation levels. According to the NDVP , the government will manage COVID-19 immunizati on medical waste during the implementation of the vaccination as per the (i) National Immunization Injection Safety Policy (2003), (ii). Health Care Waste Management Guideline in the context of COVID-19 Emergency, and (iii). National Health Care Waste Management Standards and Operating Procedures (2020). Below is the summary of key aspects of each policy and regulation that will be followed when managing the COVID -19 immunization waste : (i) National Immunization Injection Safety Policy (2003). As per the policy released by the MO HP in 2003 , all injectable vaccines in Nepal should be given with auto-disable syringes in both routine and campaign settings. All used syringes should be deposited in safety boxes and health workers are asked not to re-cap needles after injection. (ii) National Guideline on Health Care Waste Management (2014). The guideline provides practical information for safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly waste management options. The guideline also covers waste management (collection, storage, transportation, and disposal), and a health and safety system, including personal hygiene. 4 (iii) Health Care Waste Management Guideline in the context of COVID-19 Emergency (2020) . The guideline released by the MOHP in 2020 was specifically developed to address merging issues on the management of incremental medical waste due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is expected to be used by health care managers, HCWM committee members, health care workers , and cleaners at the facility level. Each health facility will manage COVID-19 vaccination-r elated medical waste according to the guideline and coordinate with the respective municipality offices if the required capacity does not exist within the he alth facility. It is also relevant for the authority especially managing the waste in quaran tine centers at national and sub-national levels. (iv) National Health Care Waste Management Standards and Operating Procedures (2020). The latest version of the standards and operating procedures endorsed by the MOHP in 2020 provides necessary guidance for standardizing HCWM practice by selecting appropriate technology and implementing effective approaches to treat health care waste. The guidance w ill minimize the potential environment al and public health risks that may be created by COVID-19 health care waste. Instructions on critical aspects of COVID-19 immunization waste management such as on-site waste segregation of immunization waste, managing both sharp wastes and infectious waste, and implementing \"reverse logistics\" waste management for collection and disposal of medical waste to the relevant stakeholders during a vaccination campaign are provided in the standards and operating procedures. 9. While policies and regulations for managing COVID-19 medical waste are in pla ce, the compliance of frontline health workers at health facilities remains challenging. The government and private hospitals, and nursing homes in the local areas usually d id not possess equipment for proper treatment and disposal of medical waste , and often mix medical waste with municipal waste and dump them openly in rivers or forest areas. In order to improve t he practice of safe and effective HCWM, trainings on infection safety and medical waste management have been incorporated into training programs to health care workers who are involved in the COVID-19 vaccine delivery at all levels. T he government, with support from the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00c3\u00bcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit, has also established an integrated mechanism for impl ementing effective HCWM at federal, provincial, and local levels as part of Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00c3\u00bcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit 's support to the government's COVID-19 pandemic response . The figure below shows the implementation structure of the integrated HCWM mechanism. 5 10. The government has developed a work plan for medical waste management at health facility level and at COVID- 19 vaccination centers. A total of$5.8 million is estimated for the work plan implementation, covering existing as well as future immunization and other HCWM in 3 years (April 2021 to December 2023). The implementation responsibility of the work p lan lies with the Family Welfare Division of DOHS. There are 141 hospitals identified for COVID -19 immunization. Of these, some level of logistics and facilities, and system of HCWM are established in 45 hospitals (32%) and no HCWM system exists in the remaining 94 hospitals (68%). The government and development partners are supporting HCWM in these 141 hospitals. As per the interim plan, waste from vaccination centers in Kathmandu Valley will be transported to a suitable hospital near an autoclave facility. A technical working group has been established with government 's and development partners ' support to coordinate and steer HCWM activities at federal, provincial and local levels. 11. Regarding the reverse logistic arrangement for COVID-19 vaccines, the NDVP ind icates that any unused vials at the end of the session will be returned to the high er store for proper management and storage. Information on each returned vial will be recorded in a hard copy of the stock register book as well as in the existing electronic logistic management in formation system (e-LMIS) . The e-LMIS can provide real-time information on stock and consumption patterns to ensure that all vaccine vials are fully accounted for in all vaccine stores. The e-LMIS is currently functioning up until the provincial level and will be expanded to the local level. The paper -based version is functioning up until the local level, where the micro-plan ning happens. IV. VACCINE PROCUREMENT PLAN 12. The government, with the support of the World Bank Group, WHO, United Nations Children's Fund and the GAVI , The Vaccine Alliance, has developed a cost estimation for implementing its COVID-19 vaccination program to vaccinate up to 71.62% of it s population in the absence of confirmed information on specific vaccine candidates, their characteristics, Implementation Structure of Effective Health Care Waste Management DoHS = Department of Health Services, GIZ = Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00c3\u00bcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit, HFOMC = Health Facility Operation and Management Committee, HMC = Hopsita l Management Committee, IHCWM =Integrted Health Care Waste Management, KfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00c3\u00bcr Wiederaufb au, MD = Management Division, MoFEnv =Ministry of Forest and Environment, MoHP = Ministry of Health and Population, MoSD = Mi nistry of Social Development, MuAN = Municipal Association of Nepal , TWG = Technical Working Group, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme.

As Nepal has joined the COVAX A dvance Market Commitment countries to secure COVID-19 vaccine(s) for 20% of the population, the cos t of these vaccines will be fully subsidized by COVAX. The proposed estimated cost of COVID-19 vaccines for the rest of the 51.62% of the population was initially $7 per dose, which is also the estimated unit cost adopted by the World Bank in its support to Nepal's vaccination progra m. However, as the current global vaccine supply is very limited with many uncertainties, the pri ce of most candidate vaccines has increased compared to the expected cost at the time of the estim ation. Therefore, as advised by the government, ADB is using $10 per doses as the updated estimated unit cost of vaccines in addition to those from COVAX and those covered by the World Bank financing. With respect to the operational cost, a per capita operational cost of $2 per person for the initial 20% of population vaccinated using vaccines from COVAX and $1 per person for rest of target population is proposed. In addition, a $3.13 million technical assistance suppor t is estimated to be required to support the implementation of the vaccination program. Table 2 summarizes the cost estimate of the government's COVID -19 vaccination program.

As of 12 May 2021, the government has utilized $8 million to procure vaccines that cover 2.79% of its population from the Serum Insititute of India (SII). The gove rnment has also received 1.1 million doses of free vaccines from the Government of India and 1.8 mill ion doses of free vaccines from the Government of People's Republic of China as gifts. Both donations cover the vaccines required for 4. 04% of the total population. The government also received 0.34 million doses of vaccines as the first shipment from the vaccines committed by COVAX. The Wo rld Bank approved the Additional Financing to COVID 19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Project on 18 March 2021 , which provides $62.6 million financial support to procure vaccines for 12. 47% of population and $10.9 million for operational cost. In addition, ADB is preparing $165 million financial support to procure vaccines for vaccinating 22.30% of population. The remaining financing gaps of the government's COVID -19 vaccination program is $83.41 million which comprises $71.7 47 million for procurement of vaccines for the remaining 10.01% of the population and $11.6 66 million for operational costs.

As of 6 May 2021 , the COVID-19 vaccines that are currently used in Nepal are AstraZenca vaccines manufactured by SII received through COVAX, donated by the Government of India, and procured from SII; and BBIBP-CorV vaccines (Sinopharm) donated by the Government of the People's Republic of China. While considering procuring additional doses of the above mentioned two types of vaccine, the government is also exploring other vaccine opt ions with good efficacy and safety, reasonable price and delivery timeline, and compatibility with the country's existing cold chain and logistics condition. The identified vaccine procurement approach includes through COVAX, United Nations Children's Fund , diplomatic channels and government- to- government support, and direct purchase from manufacturers. With respect to the reg ulatory approval status of COVID-19 vaccines, as of 13 May 2021 , the Government of Nepal has granted emergency use authorization to four COVID-19 vaccines, namely the AstraZeneca-O xford vaccine manufactured by SII , Sinopharm vaccine manufactured by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products, COVAXIN manufactured by Bharat Biotech, and Spuntik V vaccin e manufactured by Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.

The number of cases started increasing from third week of March and as of 31 December 2020, there were 260,593 cases of COVID-19 with 1856 fatality. The age-specific case fatality ratio (CFR) below 50 ye ars of age is less than one. However, the CFR increases to 1.52% in the age group 55-59 years and reaches 9.26 % in the age group above 85 years of age. For prevention of COVID-19, Nepal has applied to the COVAX Facility, which is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, for COVID-19 vaccine support for 20% of its population, with an intent to receive vaccines beyond the prioritized 20% if available through the COVAX Facility. The Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) submitted its expression of interest to the COVAX Facility on 20 August 2020, with submission of the vaccine request application on 4 December 2020, and the information on indemnification on 7 January 2021. Cold chain equipment support rolling request was submitted to COVAX Facility on 15 December 2020. This National Deployment and Vaccination Plan has been developed to plan for and guide the COVID-19 vaccination program. Based on this, operational guideline for COVID-19 vaccination program has already been developed. The National Immunization Program of Nepal has experience of conducting numerous vaccination campaigns, including reaching to the whole population (population above 1 year of age in Japanese encephalitis endemic area during JE campaign), and has introduced several new and underutilized vaccines in its routine immunization during the Decade of Vaccines 2011 - 2020. In 2020, during the ongoing pandemic, Nepal completed its nation-wide measles- rubella campaign and polio campaign in selected districts, and introduced rotavirus vaccine in routine immunization. For appropriate COVID-19 vaccine use in Nepal, all required regulatory preparedness is in place. Drugs (Third Amendment) Ordinance, 2077 (2020) has been issued by the Rt. Hon'ble President upon recommendation of The Council of Ministers on 18 November 2020 to amend the Drug Act 1978 (2035 BS) which now allows for emergency use authorization of vaccines and drugs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Department of Drug Administration (DDA), Nepal's National Regulatory Authority, is in the position to expedite emergency use authorization of potential COVID-19 vaccines for use in Nepal. Accordingly, DDA has already approved emergency use of COVISHIELDTM on 15 January 2021. Through the decision of The Council of Ministers on 4 January 2021, the provision to provide required indemnification to the manufacturer, distributor and donor is in place. Based on WHO SAGE values framework and prioritization guidance, as well as country context and disease epidemiology in the country, population prioritization and vaccination phases has been mapped out. This prioritization was recommended by the advisory committees and endorsed by The Council of Ministers. The governance mechanism at each level (federal, province, district, and local level) has been ensured by establishment of coordination and monitoring committees at all levels. Nepal already has immunization coordination committees 10 at all levels; these committees were expanded in the context of COVID-19 vaccination program governance, coordination and monitoring. The Government of Nepal has also ensured adequate funding (operational costs) for vaccinating 20% of the prioritized population and beyond. Cold chain mapping and requirements have been mapped, and surge capacity is in place where needed. Further, Nepal has already submitted for cold chain equipment support to the COVAX Facility/Gavi. Logistics planning has been done to adjust the required cold chain and dry space and transport including t racking of vaccines and security to suit the country's need. Information system has been identified for the purpose of COVID-19 vaccination. The recording/reporting system as well as supervision and monitoring plan has been prepared. Information, education, and communication materials have been prepared in detail for the program. Monitoring of the vaccine safety will be an integral part of COVID-19 vaccination program. The AEFI surveillance system of Nepal reports, investigates and conducts causality assessment of serious AEFI as per WHO guidance, which will be continued for the COVID-19 vaccination program adapting with the COVID-19 vaccines safety surveillance. The National AEFI Investigation Committee of Nepal is a committee mandated by the Immunization Act 2072 (2016) of Nepal. To implement COVID-19 vaccination program effectively, Ministry of Health and Population has developed this National Deployment and Vaccination Plan. 11 1. ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF NEPAL Nepal is a federal democratic republic country with three levels of the federal system of government: federal level, seven provinces, and 753 local levels. The total projected population of Nepal in 2021 is 30,378,055 (CBS). Figure 1: Map of Nepal showing provinces Each province is divided into districts (77 in total), each district into municipalities and rural municipalities, and each of these municipalities are further divided into wards (6743 in total). Fulfilling the requirement of the new constitution, at present, there are 6 metropolitan cities, 11 sub-metropolitan cities, 276 municipalities, and 460 rural municipalities at local level. Figure 2: Administrative structure of Nepal 12 2. COVID- 19 SITUATION 2.1 Epidemiology Global situation Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory infectious disease caused by a novel corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has spread rapidly throughout the world. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported to WHO on 31 December 2019 as a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan city of People's Republic of China. On 30 January 2020, WHO Director-General declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). In March 2020, WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 could be characterized as a pandemic. The pandemic has severely impacted health systems, economic and social progress throughout the world. As of 1 January 2021, there were 81,947,503 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,808,041 deaths globally.1 National situation In Nepal, the first case of COVID-19 was detected on 23 January 2020. COVID-19 cases incidence gradually increased from April 2020 and a peak was observed in October 2020 (Figure 3 ). Then gradually, the cases have decreased with the adoption of effective preventive measures including nationwide lockdown to control COVID-19 transmission. The cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 cases was 874 per 100,000 population for the year 2020. Figure 3: COVID-19 cases by month in Nepal, 2020 1 WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard. 1 January 2021.

Figure 4 : COVID-19 cases in the SAARC countries3 Among SAARC countries, Nepal has a recovery rate of 96.9% (Fig. 4) with case fatality rati o of 0.7%.3 COVID-19 cases by province, Nepal There is variation in the incidence of COVID-19 cases among seven provinces. As of 31 December 2020, the highest incidence was seen in Bagmati Province, which includes Kathmandu District with highest number of cases, with 2234 cases per 100,000 populations and the lowest was seen in Province 2 with 332 per 100,000 populations (Fig. 5). Figure 5 : COVID-19 incidence by province, Nepal2 2SitRep No. 326, Ministry of Health and Population, Government of Nepal. 31 December 2020. 3 SAARC Disaster Management Centre. 31 Dec 2020. by age group, Nepal Figure 6: Total number of cases by sex and age group, Nepal As of 31 December 2020, number of COVID-19 cases is highest among 21 - 40 years age group and gradually decreases with increasing age (Fig. 6). Lowest number of cases was reported in 0-10 years age group and over 80 years of age Age-specific case fatality ratio (CFR) Overall case fatality ratio of COVID-19 cases in Nepal is 0.71 % (as of 31 December 2020) . The a ge-specific CFR is < 1% in the age group below 55 years of age. However, it is higher (>1%) in the age group above 55 years, progressively increasing as the age-group increases and reaching the highest CFR of 9.26% among the cases above 85 years of age (Fig. 7 ). Figure 7: Age-specific case fatality ratio Male Infected 15 2.2 COVID-19 vaccines There are more than eight vaccine technologies or platforms being used, including the novel nuclei acid platforms which may require super or ultra-cold chain and non-replicating viral vector platforms, to develop candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The majority (~59%) of the vaccines in clinical phase have a two-dose schedule, and ~83% are injectable vaccines (~75% of the vaccines are given intra-muscular). As of 2 December 2020, there were 215 vaccine candidates in the pre-clinical phase and 59 in clinical phases. Among those in clinical phases, 25 candidate vaccines were in Phase I, 17 in Phase I/ II, 5 in Phase II, 1 in Phase II/III, and 11 in Phase III. One vaccine (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2, by Pfizer-BioNTech) received temporary authorization for emergency use from UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on 2 December, being the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive authorization from a national regulatory authority and a stringent regulatory authority. Following this, Moderna's vaccine mRNA-1273 received emergency use authorization from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 18 December, and Oxford-AstraZeneca 's non-replicating viral recombinant vector vaccine (ChAdOx1), AZD1222, received emergency use authorization from MHRA on 30 December 2020. On 31 December 2020, exactly a year after the cluster of pneumonia cases later identified as COVID-19 was reported to WHO, Pfizer-BioNTech 's mRNA vaccine became the first ever COVID-19 vaccine to receive WHO's emergency use listing (EUL), and the second ever vaccine (after nOPV2) to receive WHO's EUL. Current leading COVID-19 vaccines including those that have received emergency use authorizations and in use are as given in Table 1.

Bharat Biotech, ICMR, National Institute of Virology Inactivated III Emergency use in India 2.3 Choice of vaccine for use in Nepal As per the decision of the Council of Ministers in November 2020, the criteria prioritized for choosing a COVID-19 vaccine for use in Nepal are: 1) vaccine availability, 2) vaccine cost, 3) available infrastructure to deploy and implement vaccination (such as cold chain requirements and capacity), and 4) vaccine quality (including safety and efficacy). Based on this guidance, the criteria as given below are recommended for choosing a potential COVID-19 vaccine for use in Nepal. The basic consideration for the choice of vaccine should be based on the quality , safety and efficacy, quality, storage and transport requirements, timely availability in an adequate quantity, affordability, and the duration of protection (if data is available). While considering the quality, efficacy, and safety of the vaccine (regulatory) the following aspects will be considered. 1. Quality, safety and efficacy a. The vaccine should be WHO prequalified. If the WHO prequalified vaccine is not available, then the vaccine should have WHO emergency use listing or approved from a Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA). 17 b. If any vaccine with the above criteria is not availabl e, or is available but cannot be programmatically deployed in Nepal, the provision of section (13), sub-section (3) of the Immunization Act, 2072 can be followed (as below): (3) Not withstanding anything stated in Sub-section (2) vaccine which is not yet certified by WHO may be imported in the following conditions: (a) Manufactured in compliance with good manufacturing practices, (b) Already used in manufacturing country or in other countries, (c) Registered in national regulatory authority of the manufacturing country, and (d) Certification of the statement contained in clauses (a), (b) and (c) by the Department of Drug Administration, Nepal. c. It is expected that the vaccine quality, efficacy, and safety aspects will be covered by the regulatory mechanism as outlined in the above points aligning with the 'critical or minimal' WHO target product profile for COVID-19 vaccines (Ver. 3, 29 April 20205 or its updated versions). 2. Cold-chain and vaccine storage a. Based on existing cold-chain storage conditions and capacity in Nepal, it is preferable to have a vaccine that can be stored at 2-8 \u00b0C. b. If any vaccine with the above cold chain criteria is not available, a vaccine requiring a storage temperature of -20\u00b0C can be chosen. c. The capacity for vaccines requiring -70\u00b0C cold chain (ultra-cold chain) is not available in the immunization system of Nepal. 3. Vaccine cost a. Affordability; comparatively low-cost vaccine but fulfilling other criteria as outlined here. 4. Other considerations a. Alignment with the type of vaccine supplied by the COVAX Facility. b. Alignment with conditions specified for donor support for the vaccine (such as by the World Bank) If several vaccines fulfilling preferred criteria are available, then WHO's Criteria for COVID - 19 vaccine prioritization, 17 May 20206 (or its updated version), can be used to prioritize or evaluate vaccine candidates for use in Nepal. 2.4 Regulatory preparedness Department of Drug Administration (DDA) under the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) is the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) of Nepal for the registration of medicines and vaccines. As per the Drug Act 1978, DDA is authorized to regulate and ensure safety, quality and efficacy of medicines. In normal cases, it follows the procedures to register new medicines as per the drug regulation and directives. Drugs (Third Amendment) Ordinance, 5https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-target-product-profiles-for-CO VID- 19-vaccines 6https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/criteria-for-COVID- 19-vaccine-prioritization 18 2077 (2020) has been issued by the President upon recommendation of Council of Ministers on 18 November 2020 to amend the Drug Act 1978 (2035 BS) which now allows for emergency use authorization of vaccines and drugs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, DDA is in the position to expedite emergency use authorization of potential COVID-19 vaccines for use in Nepal. Accordingly, DDA has approved emergency use of COVISHIE LD manufactured by Serum Institute of India on 15 January 2021. For vaccine offered from the COVAX Facility, Government of Nepal will ensure issuance of emergency use authorization of the vaccine within 15 days maximum and issue import licenses from the appropriate authority within five days maximum. Program divisio ns (Family Welfare Division and Management Division) will initiate the process with Department of Drug Administration, Ministry of Health and Population. Further, DDA has the authority to waive lot release testing based on the review of summary protocols of the supplied vaccines. Vaccines supplied through non-COVAX mechanism if found suitable (as per Section 2.3 above ) will go through the expedited mechanism for licensing and approval through DDA. 2.5 Indemnification The Council of Ministers has decided on 4 January 2021 to provide indemnification to manufacturer, distributor and donor in case of occurrence of adverse event following immunization for COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, provision of indemnification as per requirement of the COVAX Facility is already in place in Nepal. 19 3. NATIONAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM The National Immunization Program (NIP) of Nepal, initiated in 1977 AD as EPI, is one of government's high -priority programs (P1). Currently, the NIP provides vaccinations against 12 pathogens for children, with immunization schedule within 2 years of life (Table 2), and schedule for missed vaccination up to 5 years of life. Through the NIP, tetanus-diphtheria vaccine is given to all pregnant women. The NIP during catch-up vaccination campaigns have reached nation-wide population up to 15 years of age (measles/measles-rubella campaign), and even whole population above one year of age in targeted endemic districts during Japanese encephalitis vaccination campaign. Even in current decentralized structure due to the federal system, immunization, being a basic health service, remains the responsibility of the federal government (for e.g., procurement, policy) with implementation by all levels of the government (federal, provincial and local/palika level). Immunization services are delivered primarily through the government's nation -wide health network; however, a small fraction of the service delivery is provided through the private sector, especially in metropolitan areas. Routine immunization services reach beneficiaries through fixed-site sessions (institutional, health facility), outreach sessions, and where needed, mobile clinics. There are more than 16,000 service delivery points (immunization sessions) per month in the country. The NIP has been acknowledged as one of the main contributors to the decline in infant and child deaths to achieve all targets under MDG Goal 4 in Nepal. In the Decade of Vaccines 2011 - 2020, Nepal has introduced several new and underutilized vaccines in its routine immunization with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, support (inactivated polio virus vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, measles component of measles-rubella second dose, HPV for demonstration program, and rotavirus vaccine) as well as through its own funds (Japanese encephalitis vaccine, rubella vaccine with measles). During the period, Nepal has conducted numerous national and sub-national vaccination campaigns including measles and rubella, Japanese encephalitis, and polio campaigns, achieving high coverages. Table 2: Routine immunization schedule in Nepal, National Immunization Program Age Vaccine(s) At birth BCG At 6 weeks DTP-HepB-Hib 1, PCV 1, OPV 1, Rota 1, fIPV 1 10 weeks DTP-HepB-Hib 2, PCV 2, OPV 2, Rota 2 At 14 weeks DTP-HepB-Hib 3, OPV 3, fIPV 2 At 9 months PCV 3, MR 1 At 12 months JE At 15 months MRSD (MR 2) In pregnancy Td 20 Abbreviations: v accination Following the devastating major earthquake in 2015, the health system of Nepal, including immunization has quickly rebuilt showing the resilience of the program, with immunization coverages quickly coming back to or higher than its pre-earthquake levels. Since then, in August 2018, Nepal was certified by WHO SEARO as having achieved control of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome through immunization. This certification is two years ahead of the regional target year of 2020 and one year ahead of the national target of 2019. Further, in July 2019, Nepal was certified of having achieved hepatitis B control among children through immunization. Nepal is the first country in the WHO South East Asia Region to have an immunization act. With the Immunization Act 2072 (2016), the NIP has moved from program- based approach to right-based approach for immunization. During the current COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Nepal was probably one of the first countries in the world to conduct and complete a mass vaccination campaign (nation-wide MR campaign) as well as to introduce a new and underutilized vaccine (rotavirus vaccine) in its NIP emphasizing the importance of immunization. The performance of NIP has been noteworthy over the years. The WUENIC7 shows high coverage of basic vaccines in Nepal. Figure 8 : National vaccination coverage trend, 2015 - 2019, Nepal Within the Department of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Population, the responsible division for implementing the immunization program is the Family Welfare Division (FWD). The NIP is supported by five other divisions and centers which are Management division (MD) for cold chain and logistics management, and health information management (HMIS); National Health Education, Information and Communication Center (NHEICC) for advocacy 7 WHO and UNICEF estimates of immunization coverage. https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/npl.pdf 94939596 96 91 87909193 85 839091 2017 2018 YearBCG DPT-HepB-Hib 3 MR 121 and communication-related activities; and National Health Training Centre (NHTC) for training. Surveillance of vaccine preventable diseases is supported by the Programme for Immunization Preventable Diseases, WHO, Nepal (WHO-IPD). 22 4. COVID-19 VACCINATION IN NEPAL Government of Nepal has decided to vaccinate targeted population in Nepal against COVID- 19 when the appropriate vaccine for Nepal is available. Nepal has submitted vaccine request application to the COVAX Facility to cover 20% prioritized population, including intent to receive vaccine beyond 20% if available through the COVAX Facility. Accordingly, this NDVP has been developed to guide for planning and preparation. National operational guideline for COVID-19 vaccination (in Nepali) has already been developed and disseminated. This guideline includes the strategy and plans as included in th is NDVP. 4.1 Prioritization of target group Although everyone is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact is not shared equally. Some groups, especially older age groups and those having underlying health conditions, are experiencing serious illness and death at higher rates. Other groups are experiencing disproportionately greater illness and other burdens because of societal factors, e.g. people living in poverty with limitations to practice infection prevention and control measures, and people experiencing barriers to accessing quality health care. Nepal's p rioritization of beneficiaries for COVID-19 vaccination (Table 3) has been developed based on guidance and recommendations given in WHO SAGE Values Framework8, WHO SAGE Roadmap for Vaccine Prioritization9 and the current country context including epidemiological evidence of Nepal. This prioritization was developed with recommendatio n from Nepal's COVID -19 Vaccine Advisory Committee and reviewed and recommended by the National Immunization Advisory Committee, which is the committee mandated by the Immunization Act 2072 (2016) of Nepal. The prioritization10 is endorsed by The Council of Ministers of Nepal. The given prioritization or phases can be updated based on various factors including: 1. Evolving epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in the country. 2. Number of vaccine/doses that would be available at each time, for which the prioritization or the phases may need to be further broken down or clubbed based on doses availability. a. Within the 'occupational ' targeted group, those with higher risk of exposure due to the nature of their work and involved with higher risk or vulnerable group, as well as principle of reciprocity will be applied if less vaccine doses are available in one tranche. b. Within the targeted group by 'age-group' , since epidemiological data shows higher CFR for increasing age (Fig 7), those in the higher age groups will be prioritized if less vaccine doses are available in one tranche. 8 WHO SAGE values framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, 14 September 2020 9 WHO SAGE roadmap for prioritizing uses of COVID-19 vaccines in the context of limite d supply, V1, 20 October 2020 10 A proposal for ensuring resource requirement for COVID-19 vaccine, November 2020 23 3. Type of vaccine available including its safety and efficacy, absolute and relative or provisional contraindications, such as for special population (for example, pregnancy) and age groups (for example, children and adolescents, very elderly age groups). The prioritized population, their risk tier, population size, and rationale for prioritization are mentioned in the table below. Table 3: Prioritized population and phases for COVID-19 vaccination Phase Target group Approx. target no. (% of total population) Rationale 1 Frontline workers of health and social sector 911,342 (3%) Rationale for prioritization: Health-workers and other front-line workers bear significant additional and high risk of acquiring as well as transmitting COVID-19 infection. This target group work with vulnerable population; and this target group is essential to continue response to COVID-19 pandemic as well as to continue essential services including health services. Further, it is our duty to safeguard the welfare of those who have worked for our welfare and safety even during the current pandemic. These groups by nature of their placement, may have higher exposure to infection or cannot practice infection prevention or control adequately and are vulnerable. The targeted groups within this prioritization are: Health care workers, including hospital/health facility staff sanitation/garbage/waste management collectors and drivers Ambulance and mortuary van driver and helper Volunteers and security staf f deployed in immunization centres Workers directly involved in dead body management Female Community Health Volunteers Health workers and staff working in international point of entries Elderly and their care-takers at old age homes Prisoners and security staff in prisons SAGE guidance/principle reference: 24 Human well-being (including protecting the continuing functioning of essential services, including health services); reciprocity 2A All elderly 55 years of age 3,733,463 (12.29%) Rationale for prioritization: Age-specific case fatality ratio (CFR) data from Nepal has continually shown that the risk of death due to COVID-19 increases significantly from age 55 years and above. From age 0 to 54 years the CFR ranges from 0.02% to 0.78% increasing with age (all age-specific CFR < 1%). However, from age 55 years the CFR increases to 1.52%, progressively increasing with age up to 9.26% at 85+ years of age. Therefore, this target group is prioritized for vaccination due to high case fatality. SAGE guidance/principle reference: Human well-being (including reducing deaths and disease burden from the COVID-19 pandemic) 2B Persons with co- morbidity in 40 - 54 years age- group 1,117,912 (3.68%) Rationale for prioritization: Age based risk (high CFR) is as covered in Phase 2A above. However, regardless of age, those with co-morbid conditions are also at higher risk of mortality from COVID-19. Therefore, for Phase 2B, persons with co- morbid conditions within age-group 40 - 54 years are prioritized for vaccination. Currently, co-morbid conditions prioritized as per data available for case mortality are as given below. This list may be updated based on evolving need and risk factors. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe asthma Persons with organ transplant Chronic renal failure Cancer Serious heart conditions (heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies, etc) Diabetes mellitus Sickle cell anaemia SAGE guidance/principle reference: Human well-being (including: Reduce deaths and disease burden from the COVID-19 pandemic) 2C Migrant labor with co- morbidity and refugees 312,894 (1%) Rationale for prioritization: Migrant labor workers (Nepali) are population having high exposure to infection due to their mobility and may be excluded for vaccination due to various reasons such as due to lack of access and prioritization. Therefore, migrant labor workers with co-morbidity are prioritized for 25 with co- morbidity vaccination in this phase. Further, refugees are the vulnerable yet often neglected population, and are usually not under the health care system. Therefore, refugees with co-morbidities are prioritized in this phase. Data on total refugees (total: ~20,000) and those with co-morbidities and vulnerabilities (~4500) in Nepal are already available through UNHCR. Other migrant workers and refugees not falling under this category will be vaccinated as per other prioritizations, such as age-risk based prioritization. SAGE guidance/principle reference: Human national equity above prioritization (Phase 1, 2A, 2B, 2C) covers 20% of the population = Total 3A Remaining 40 - 54 years: prioritization (Phase 3A, of the population = Total 15,681,152 Note: The lower age cut-off of 15 years in Phase 3B may be changed to higher age based on available vaccine's age recommendation. Based on epidemiological need, and available number of doses in each tranche, the above phases/prioritization can be clubbed or further divided. 4.2 Vaccination delivery strategies Considering the supply constraint of COVID-19 vaccines, vaccination will be conducted in a phased manner starting from the highest prioritized groups. In addition to vaccine availability, strategies will depend on the characteristics of the vaccine to be deployed. The following strategies will be implemented for vaccinating the priority population; As most of the potential COVID-19 vaccines have two-dose schedule, the strategy and planning will be to provide two-dose schedule. Vaccination will be conducted in a phase wise manner without any interruption to routine immunization services. All health workers and occupational groups will be vaccinated through identified health facilities. Pregnant, lactating mothers, and children below specific year (as per available vaccine's age cut -off) will not be given COVID-19 vaccine unless there is a specific recommendation for the available vaccine, and risk-benefit situation. 26 o WHO SAGE guidance for each vaccine in use will be adopted based on country context and National Immunization Advisory Committee recommendations. Only trained health workers will provide vaccination. Appropriate recording and reporting will be done. Each vaccinated person will get a vaccination card. The vaccination card will have two sides (counter-foil), with the detachable part provided to the vaccinated person (Fig. 9, middle part), and the remaining counter-foil kept at the health facility (Fig. 9, left part) . The back side of the vaccination card provided to the vaccinated person will have information on the vaccine given including minor expected reactions, interval between the doses given, measures for protection against COVID-19 as well as information on routine immunization (Fig. 9, right part). The National Immunization Program of Nepal has vast experience in conducting nation-wide immunization campaigns and has even reached whole population (above 1 year) in Japanese encephalitis endemic areas during Japanese encephalitis vaccination campaigns. The recent nation-wide immunization campaign was the Gavi-supported measles-rubella campaign (included selected districts polio campaign) in 2020, which was successfully conducted during the pandemic vaccinating 2. 5 million under 5 children (~ 9% of the total population). The immunization sessions are planned and conducted as fixed site/health facility immunization sessions, outreach immunization sessions/sites (for routine), mobile clinics (in geographically hard- to-reach areas), and expanded outreach immunization sessions/sites beyond the routine immunization outreach sessions for campaigns. These sites are already identified immunization sessions within the micro-planning of each health facility and are ready for immunization deployment as per need. These sessions/sites are as follows. Figure 9. COVID-19 vaccination card 27 Health facilities: Nepal has 5,188 health facilities, out of which >80% are providing fixed site routine immunization throughout the country every month. This includes all government health facilities including provincial level, district level, and local level health facilities (hospitals, primary health care centers, health posts, and selected urban and community health facilities). Further, designated private hospitals also provide immunization services through the National Immunization Program. Routine outreach immunization sites: Each government health facility has 3 - 5 outreach immunization sites providing immunization sessions routinely covering the geography within their catchment area. These outreach sites along with the health facility sites amounts to total of >16,000 immunization sessions per month. Vaccination campaign immunization sites: To cover large number of populations within a short-time with geographical reach, the sessions used in mass immunization campaigns, such as in recent nation-wide MR SIA, have been identified. On average this modality has 10 session sites in each ward of a metropolitan and sub-metropolitan city, 8 session sites in each ward of urban municipality, and 6 session sites in each ward of rural municipality, and can amount up to 48,000 booths (number can be less as per need based on local micro-planning; hard- to-reach populations are identified and reached as part of local micro-planning) Vaccination for first prioritization (Phase 1; 3 % Population) This prioritization includes mostly occupational group, the majority being health care workers. Therefore, this targeted population will be vaccinated at health facilities (details below). Further, groups such as in old age homes and prisons will be vaccinated in these instit ution's location itself, where the vaccination team will visit. Immunization session site: Based on number of people to be vaccinated, federal, provincial, teaching, district and similar level hospitals (government, non- governmental, and private hospitals) will be chosen based on number of people to be vaccinated in each district. There will be at least one immunization session site (fixed) in each district (besides the mobile clinics to the old age homes, prisons, international point of entries, etc) More immunization sites will be added as per need, if: o There are more than 200 persons to be vaccinated (staff) within a hospital, then the hospital itself can function as immunization session site. o Based on need due to geographical conditions and distance. In such conditions, strategic locations will be selected for vaccination. Immunization session sites/strategic locations will be selected or added by the District Health Office under direction of the District Coordination and Monitoring Committee for COVID-19 vaccination. Immunization session sites will be selected only in appropriate locations where security can be provided, AEFI management can be done , vaccine wastage can be minimized, and vaccination of the targeted beneficiaries as per the phase can be ensured. 28 Vaccination for second prioritization (Phase 2A, 2B, 2C; 17% Population) Compared to Phase 1, which is mostly occupational group, this prioritization includes wider targeted groups including those in the community. Therefore, based on experience from Phase 1 as above and recent MR campaign, type of vaccine available, further immunization se ssion sites will be added on top of the immunization sessions sites in Phase 1, as decided during micro-planning at the health facility level (local micro-planning) with Palika Coordination Committee/Palika Immunization Coordination Committee, and endorsed by the District Coordination and Monitoring Committee for COVID-19 vaccination. These immunization session sites will be in the strategic locations within the routine and campaign immunization sessions site locations where security can be provided and AEFI management can be done, including where crowd-management can be done properly with infection prevention and control measures implementation, and where adequate registration, vaccination and observation area is available. 4.3 Estimation and validation of target population For first prioritization (Phase 1) Line listing of occupational targeted beneficiaries will be collected from their respective institutions (such as respective health facility for health care workers, health facility staf f, and female community health volunteers; respective municipality office for sanitation workers; respective old age homes and prisons; respective international point of entries, etc. ) through palika (municipality) and maintained at the District Health Office level. Validation and reporting of this line-listing to the Health Office will be the responsibility of the head of each of these institutions. Aggregate numbers by type of beneficiaries will be reported by district level to province and federal level for resource planning including logistics planning. Where needed, these aggregate reporting will be validated with respective departments and ministries at national level (for e.g., professional councils for health care workers; Department of Prison Management, MOHA, for prisoners and prison staff, etc.) Listing and location of refugees in Nepal including co-morbidities or vulnerability are available through UNHCR. For second prioritization (Phase 2) Line listing of targeted population by age-group will be prepared from different sources (such as voter list, palika level census, etc.) and maintained by respective palika (municipality; local administrative office) for each ward. The aggregate number will be reported to district (Health Office), province, and federal level for resource and logistics planning. Similarly, list of persons with co-morbidities for the applicable age-group only (40 - 54 age group only) will be 29 prepared by the palika through the local health facility. Validated reporting of targeted persons will be the function of respective palika (municipality). Where needed, these aggregate reporting will be validated with respective departments and ministries at national level (for e.g., Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration; Department of National ID and Civil Registration, MOHA, for senior citizens social security allowance beneficiaries, etc.) 30 5. LOGISTICS PLANNING AND COLD CHAIN The cold chain and vaccine management is led by the Logistics Management Section , Management Division, Department of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Population, with the support of partners including UNICEF and WHO. A National Vaccine Logistics Working Group with terms of reference to coordinate the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary products is functional. There is one central vaccine store in Kathmandu, and an extended central store in Pathlaiya, Bara District. The central vaccine store is in the premises of Management Division, DOHS, which is close to the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA). This central store receives vaccines directly from the vaccine manufacturer at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), the vaccines are transported in a refrigerator van and are stored in walk in cooler rooms. The central store in Pathlaiya is near the Nepal-India border. Vaccine related logistics supplies (syringes, safety boxes, cold chain equipment and other dry goods) supplied from manufacturers through roadway via India (transit from seaports or other location s) are stored at this store and supplied to the Provincial Health Logistics Management Centres (PHLMC). There are six provincial vaccine stores (PHLMC) in Nepal. These stores receive vaccines and immunization supplies from the central vaccine stores. In routine immunization system, the se stores are allowed to maintain a maximum stock of 4.5 months. The provincial stores distribute vaccines to district-level stores or health facilities. Out of the seven provinces, Province 2 and 6 (Karnali Province) do not have a provincial vaccine store and, therefore, are currently supplied from the provincial stores in Biratnagar (Province 1) and Hetauda (Bagmati Province), and Nepalgunj (Province 5) respectively. There is a total of 77 district vaccine stores, one in each district. These district vaccine stores receive vaccines from the provincial vaccine stores but in some instances these stores receive vaccine from the central stores as well (especially for district in and near Kathmandu Valley) . Service delivery points receive vaccine from the district vaccine store s. The lowest supply chain level is sub-store/local level government service delivery points (SP) such as health centres and health posts. 5.1 Vaccine Logistics Forecasting COVID-19 vaccination is planned in a phase-wise manner as described in Chapter 4 to cover 3% population followed by 17% population and 52% of the population of Nepal. The vaccine requirement has been estimated with an assumption of two doses per person and a wastage rate of maximum 15% (1.18 Wastage Multiplication Factor). The WMF of 1.18 is applied assuming that the COVID-19 vaccines probably will not have VVM and needs to be discarded within 6 hours after opening the vial (not having MDVP); and target population might be less in the remote areas where even for less than 10 persons one vial must be open. 31 Total vaccine requirements and cold-chain space forecasting for different phase is detailed in Table 4. Table 4: Target population, vaccine requirement, and cold chain space required by phase for COVID-19 vaccination Phase Target group % Total Pop. Target population size Vaccine doses required (2 doses) Total vaccine doses (Including WMF 1.18) Cold Chain space needed in m3* 1 Health and front- line workers 3% 55 y); per dose/1000 Table 5 : Available cold chain space and space required for COVID-19 vaccines (2- 8 ) at supply chain levels* Supply Chain Levels Space availa ble (m3) Space needed for RI (m3)^ Remaining space after RI (m3) ^ Space required for COVID-19 vaccine (m3) Surplus / Gap for COVID-19 Vaccine (m3) Solutions to -45.4 Surge capacity available (Table 8) PVS-1: Biratnagar 9.8 7.1 2.7 1.6 9.3 1.0 -6.6 Staggering delivery to the store if required.

By specific vaccine, this co ld chain gap may reduce. For e.g, COVISHIELD vaccine cold chain space per dose is only 2.1 cm3. ^ Space calculation for RI includes 6 months vaccines in central vaccine store, and 4.5 months in provincial vaccine store. Space gap is compensated by frequent cycle of delivery to the stores. ^^Although calculation is given for 17% target population, it is expected th at the vaccine supplied through COVAX Facility will come in tranches of maximum 5% each. The gap seen in central vaccin e store can be adjusted with the surge capacity if required (see Table 8). Further, vaccine allocation to th e provincial level can be given in staggered delivery to accommodate any cold chain space gap. The calculation in the table above includes cold-chain space required for Provin ce 2 and Province 6 (Karnali) Currently, the total space available for the vaccines to be stored at 2 to 8 0C is 100.52 m3 (45.50 m3 at the central vaccine store and 55.0 m3 at provincial stores). Based on the existing cold chain capacity to accommodate routine vaccines and further to accommodate COVID-19 vaccine, there is a need to have additional cold chain equipment. The solutions to address gaps are explained in Table 5. For longer term, to strengthen cold chain system, the plan is to replace the existing 8 WICs (3 in CVS/Kathmandu and 5 in PVS/each one in Biratnagar, Hetauda, Pokhara, Nepalgunj and of more than10 years, with Gavi CCE support application. Moreover, the Ministry of Health and Population has plan to build dedicated vaccine stores in Province 2 and Province 6 (Karnali) which are currently supplied from other provincial vaccine stores. With all these considerations, a summary of the cold chain deployment plan, as submitted to Gavi/COV AX Facility CCE application, is presented in Table 6.

The current cold chain capacity at district and sub-district level for COVI D-19 vaccination is given in the table below. Table 7: Cold chain capacity of District Vaccine Store and Sub-Centres Supply Chain Levels Normal Cold Chain (+2 to + 8 ) Space available Space needed for RI* Space available for COVID-19 vaccine Space needed for COVID-19 vaccine 3% 17% District Vaccine Store (DVS) 43.5 12.8 30.7 10 56.4 Cold Chain Sub-Centre (SC) 29 7.3 21.7 10 56.4 *RI space calculation is for maximum 2.25 months stock. 5.3 Cold chain surge capacity Mapping has been done for the cold chain space available (cold room) outside the immunization system with the potential to use for COVID-19 vaccine storage. An estimated space of 81m3 is available for 2 to 8 and 25m3 for - 20 . An arrangement has been made to use this space to store COVID-19 vaccine in case of a surge or whenever needed. The cold chain space available outside the routine immunization system is given in Table 8.

The CCE already installed through Gavi CCEOP support have been taken into account for sub-national level capacity calculation. 5.5 Segregation of COVID-19 vaccine COVID-19 vaccine will be stored in a dedicated CCE or refrigerator at central, provincial and district level. Only in exceptional case, storage of COVID-19 vaccine will be kept in same cold room or refrigerator if there is no extra cold room or refrigerator available. In such case s, there will be clear separation with well labelling of COVID-19 vaccines, and recording/reporting. 5.6 Dry Storage Space Central vaccine stores have enough capacity (2838m3) to accommodate syringes, safety boxes and other supplies. The total required number of AD syringes (0.5ml) for COVID-19 vaccine to cover 20% population is about 13.4 million, which will require 809 m3 of dry spaces. An adequate dry space is available at central vaccine store with a total of 2838m3 to accommodate the need for storing vaccine accessories. In addition, there are adequate spaces for dry stora ge at province and district levels. 5.7 COVID- 19 vaccines transportation At the central vaccine store, there are two refrigerator vans with a gross capacity of 19 m3 and 20 m3 for collection of vaccines from TIA and distribution of vaccines from the central vaccine store to provincial vaccine stores. Similarly, 6 provincial vaccine stores have refrigerator vans with a capacity of 10 m3 each for transportation of vaccines to the vaccine stores. All provincial vaccine stores transport/distribute vaccines in refrigerator vans up to the district vaccine stores. Health facilities collect vaccines from the respective districts using passive containers in public vehicles and motorbikes on monthly basis for routine immunization; during mass campaigns vaccine can also be distributed directly by the District Health Office to the health facilities in designated vehicles for vaccine transportation. Transportation to the central vaccine store : COVID- 19 vaccines will be received from the manufacturer through air shipment at TIA and then stored at the central vaccine store. The vaccine will be stored in WIC with full security. All received quantities will be enter ed into the computerized stock management system, e-LMIS, as well as in the paper-based recording system. Vaccines will be dispatched from the central vaccine store to subsequent supply chain points. Transportation to the provincial vaccine stores: Central vaccine store is responsible for the delivery of vaccines to provincial vaccine stores as per the distribution plan (every three months 35 for routine immunization). In the case of COVID-19 vaccine, central vaccine store will deliver to provincial stores within a week of arrival at CVS (or based on need according to phases). Transportation to the district vaccine stores: All provincial vaccine stores have their refrigerator van and are responsible for vaccine delivery from provincial vaccine stores to district vaccine stores on monthly basis. In the case of COVID-19 vaccine, there will be a distribution plan to transport vaccine to district vaccine stores. Similarly, special arrangement will be made for transportation of COVID-19 vaccine below district level based on micro planning. 5.8 Distribution of syringes, safety boxes, and ancillaries for COVID-19 vaccines: Generally, DOHS usually hires vehicles (truck, container) to supply the goods and commodities from the central warehouse to provincial stores. Vaccines and syringes are distributed separately from center to province and province to district based on the distribution plan. Vaccines and syringes are distributed as per the bundling system to the health facilities. 5.9 Trained staff for Cold Chain Nepal has a special category of trained health workers titled Cold Chain Officer/Assistant and other health workers to look after cold chain logistics for vaccination. They have experience in safe vaccine logistics and have supported successfully in various nation-wide campaigns. For COVID-19 vaccine as well, these cold chain staff will be trained for safe keeping of COVID- 19 vaccine and their deployment as planned. Similarly, adequate safety will be ensured during storage and transportation. The dedicated cold chain staff are available at central, provincial as well as each of the districts in Nepal, and are included in all new vaccine introductions and vaccination campaign trainings and implementation. 5.10 Security of the vaccine and vaccination centre The security of COVID-19 vaccines at all levels (federal/provincial/district/local) will be ensured right after the vaccine is receiv ed at the TIA. The MOHP will coordinate with Ministry of Home Affairs for the security of the vaccines and staff deployed for COVID-19 vaccination. Towards this, a high-level government official (Joint Secretary, MOHP) has been assigned to coordinate with security authorities at all supply chain level. It will also be ensured that refrigerator van will be tracked by the GPS system while vaccine transportation in coordination with security authority. Management Division, Provincial Health Logistic Management Centres, and Health Offices will closely work with security officials to monitor vaccine security at their respective levels. Further, local governments will coordinate to ensure the security of the vaccines and personnel deployed at local level. 5.11 Temperature monitoring An electronic temperature monitoring device (fridge tag) with manual extraction of data will be used in all active cold chain equipment to monitor the temperature. If any excursion event occurs, appropriate actions will be taken. Besides this, the temperature is monitored manually and documented twice a day in the logbook. 36 5.12 Logistics information system For COVID-19 vaccines information system including tracking, there is an online (e-LMIS) system existing within the country. COVID-19 vaccines will be recorded in the e-LMIS system to get real-time information on stock and consumption patterns. This system is fully functional up to the provincial vaccine stores. Paper-based recording and reporting is maintained at all levels. Further, there is a potential to introduce a barcode/QR scanner to track the COVID-19 vaccines. For service level usage data (aggregate data), integrate health management information system (IHMIS) under the Management Division is used. For COVID-19 vaccination service level data, designated recording and reporting forms will be used for timely reporting. 5.13 Reverse logistics COVID-19 vaccines will be segregated from other vaccines while storing at different levels with separate stock records. Any unused vials at the end of the session or from stores will be returned to the higher store for proper management and storage. Each returned vial information will be recorded in the e-LMIS system as well as in a h ard copy stock register book. This will be ensuring all vaccine vials are fully accounted for in all vaccine stores. 5.1 Management of health care waste and injection safety During COVID-19 vaccination, health care waste would be generated from both vaccination as well as from infection prevention and control measures taken for COVID-19. Further, it is important to follow injection safety to protect both the health care workers and the beneficiaries. As per Nepal's National Immunization Injection Safety Policy 2003, all injectable vaccines are given with auto disable (AD) syringes in both routine and campaigns settings. All used syringes are deposited in safety boxes. Health workers do not re-cap needles after injection. All training programs on vaccination have emphasized on injection safety (and on immunization error). All health workers and health facilities follow injection safety and waste management policy. For, COVID-19 vaccine delivery, both injection safety and waste care management will be part of the training. Health care waste management (HCWM) will be a budgeted activity for COVID- 19 vaccine delivery for all levels. Each health facility will manage waste accordingly , and coordinate with respective municipality office for this if capacity does not exist within the health facility. MOHP's HCWM guideline, 2014, is the guiding document for HCWM. Following this, National Health Care Waste Management Standards and Operating Procedures 2020 has already been endorsed by MOHP. Therefore, this guidance will be used for environment-37 friendly management of COVID-19 health care waste. A summary is given below, and exact method will vary according to resources available at the local level/health facility. For sharp wastes: Non-burn technology such as autoclave or microwave Chemical treatment Encapsulation Septic concrete vault Sanitary landfill (post-encapsulation) Deep burial (post-encapsulation) For infectious waste: Non-burn technology such as autoclave or microwave Chemical treatment Sanitary land-fill (post disinfection / chemical treatment) Deep burial (post disinfection / chemical treatment) 38 6. GOVERNANCE / MACRO-PLANNING 6.1 Governance Structure Ministry of Health and Population is responsible for overall policy guidance, quality assurance, resource allocation, multi-sectoral coordination and communication, whereas overall implementation of immunization is responsibility of the Department of Health Services under MOHP. According to the Immunization Act 2072 (2016) the National Immunization Advisory Committee (NIAC) and National Immunization Committee (NIC) are mandated to guide and support the overall immunization programme across the country. Further, National AEFI Investigation Committee is also the committee mandated by the Immunization Act 2072 of Nepal. Ministry of Health and Population on 21 September 2020 has constituted National COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Committee (COVAC) to advise MOHP on COVID-19 vaccine related issues and implementation in Nepal. This group consists of experts on immunization, research, and representation from National Immunization Advisory Committee, and are supported by WHO and UNICEF. It aims to guide on all aspects of COVID-19 vaccine introduction in Nepal including regulatory guidance on vaccine access, vaccine selection, equitable distribution of vaccine, procurements, financing, delivery mechanisms, prioritization of population groups, vaccine safety surveillance, communication and media response etc. As part of the COVID-19 response the Government of Nepal has formed various working committees to facilitate implementation of COVID-19 vaccination across the three tiers of the government. The following governance structure will guide COVID-19 vaccination programme. Figure 10: COVID-19 vaccine governance structure 39 The constitution of the committees and their terms of reference are as follows. 6.2 Facilitating Committee for COVID-19 vaccine The composition of the Facilitating Committee for COVID-19 vaccine is as given below.

MICRO-PLANNING Micro-planning at the health facility and palika level (local) will be initiated in advance based on anticipated vaccine arrival. The preparatory works at district level has already been initiated. The lessons learned from each phase will be utilized for subsequent phases. The COVID-19 vaccination guideline developed will be used by the health facility and local level for micro- planning and executing COVID-19 vaccination. The coordination and monitoring committee and task force at each level will be responsible to guide, support and implement micro-planning and monitoring. Prior to the district micro-planning, Health Office (district level) will send formats to collect necessary information required to prepare micro-plan. Micro planning activities will include: Information sharing regarding initiation of vaccination Preparation of list of beneficiaries as per the priority/category Listing possible sites of vaccination and additional requirement of sites if any Listing of potential vaccinators and additional requirement number if any Required number of volunteers Monitoring and supervision pre-campaign and during campaign Planning and preparation for surveillance and management of AEFI including potential referral centres for serious AEFIs Storage and distribution mechanism of vaccines and ancillary goods (cold chain) Waste management Hygiene promotion, infection prevention and control measures During the COVID-19 vaccination campaign every effort will be done not to disrupt routine immunization and other essential health services. Micro-planning at palika level (local/municipality level) Micro-planning will be undertaken at each of the 753 palika of the country focusing on the targeted age group to be covered, and this will be further compiled at district level. For this purpose, the following is planned: Issuance of a letter to all palika for furnishing detail on the number of populations by age category (5 years interval) for vaccine logistics purpose. Preparing a list of the beneficiaries (based on the availability of vaccine) by age categories and other categories as per requirement of each phase (such as occupational category, co-morbidities). Selection of most appropriate vaccination centre based on the number of beneficiaries, travel time to reach the vaccination booth, safety, etc. Allocation of responsible health workers to organize the booth in coordination with Palika Immunization Coordination Committee. 47 Informing the district level vaccine store about requirement of vaccine and vaccine related logistics and obtaining the vaccine in time with clarity on mode of transportation. All forms and formats to be used for planning, micro-planning and recording/reporting are given in 12. Recording and Reporting. Vaccination strategies and vaccination sessions/sites selection are detailed in 4.2 Vaccination delivery strategy. 48 8. VACCINATION SESSION CONDUCTION Based on experience with several nation-wide vaccination campaigns, the general steps for vaccination session are given below. Details of vaccination sessions strategy is also covered in Section 4.2 Vaccination delivery strategies. 8.1 Preparation before vaccination Potential vaccination centres will be identified during micro-planning workshop based on mapping of the health facilities. It will be based on target group and potential vaccination sites and target group especially considering co-morbid and elderly population and prepared for vaccination. The information on vaccination sites will be shared to all staff of health facilities and palikas including local, community and religious leaders. A checklist of required materials for conducting a vaccination session will be prepared, orientated and distributed to each vaccinator. Establishment of immunization session sites is covered in Section 4.2 Vaccination delivery strategies. 8.2 Vaccination booth arrangement The vaccination will be conducted at sites where adequate ventilation can be maintained. In addition, the vaccination sites will be selected on the basis where appropriate infection prevention and control measures (use of masks, hand hygiene and maintenance of physical distance of at least 2 meter s) to protect health workers, vaccine recipients, and the community, can be ensured and implemented. The layout for the vaccination booth will be as follows: 1. Check-in Area : for registration and verification of identity 2. Counselling Area : Counselling and screening 3. Vaccination area : Vaccination and recording in vaccination card 4. Post-vaccination area : observation area (for AEFI); further counselling and reminder for the second dose. All these areas will be clearly marked with clear entry and exit areas with one-way flow. Figure 11: Vaccination Booth Arrangement 49 8.3 Human resource for managing vaccination booth It is assumed that at least four persons will be running the vaccination booth as follows: 1. At the check-in area, registration and identity verification will be conducted by one trained worker or volunteer. 2. At counselling area: one person (preferably health worker) will provide pre-vaccination counselling and screening 3. Vaccination area: one health worker who will administer the COVID-19 vaccine and issue a vaccination card. 4. Post-vaccination area: one health worker who will observe the vaccinated persons for any symptoms of AEFI and counsel on second visit. There will be at least two health workers to manage vaccination and post-vaccination activities in each vaccination booth. Roles and responsibilities will be defined to all the health workers and volunteers including FCHVs. Besides the vaccine, ancillary supplies, AEFI kit, recording and reporting forms, the vaccination team will also be supplied with masks, hand washing soaps and sanitizer for IPC measures. 8.4 Number of vaccination booth This part is covered in Section 4.2 Vaccination delivery strategies. 8.5 Infection prevention and control (IPC) during vaccination session Infection prevention and control principles and procedures will be applied during the vaccination activities to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Key IPC measures11 of hand hygiene (hand-washing and use of sanitizers), use of required PPEs as per risk and standard precautions, injection safety and appropriate waste management and disinfection will be done. 11 Aide-memoire: Infection prevention and control (IPC) principles and procedu res for COVID-19 vaccination activities. WHO. 15 January 2021. 50 9. FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR COVID-19 VACCINATION Cost Estimation To carry out COVID-19 vaccination, budget has been prepared to cover for 20% high priority population through COVAX Facility supported vaccine in consultation with external development partners. As per the information received so far, vaccine along with accessories will be supplied by COVAX facility free of cost for the 20% prioritized population. Further, application for cold chain equipment support amounting US$ 720,000 has been submitted to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The operation cost to conduct COVID-19 vaccination (amounting US$ 5,266,021) is set aside by the Government of Nepal (GON) as given in Table 9 Table 9: Estimated operational cost to implement COVID-19 vaccination (prioritized 20% population) Particulars Government COVAX Facility/Gavi Remarks COVID-19 vaccine Vaccine and accessories for 20% prioritized population will be provided free of cost by COVAX Facility Cold Chain Equipment US$ 720,000 Space for cold chain equipment establishment already decided by GON Operation cost (total) US$ 5,266,021 0 NPR 619,916,000* * conversion rate at 1 US$ = N PR 117.72 as of 19 Jan 2021 Out of the estimated total operational cost, GON has already disbursed 84% of the budget to federal and sub-national level. GON has also allocated budget to construct vaccine stores at provinces to house the cold chain equipment requested to the COVAX Facility/Gavi. Development partners like World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and EU have pledged to support in various activities when vaccination activities will start. Table 10: Allocated operational budget for COVID-19 vaccination by level (in NPR)^ Particulars Federal Provincial / District Total % Training and Orientation 1,800,000 127,351,000 129,151,000 20.83 Microplanning and Preparation monitoring 3,700,000 AEFI medicine 46,715,000 7.54 Total 153,500,000 466,416,000 619,916,000 100 ^ summarized based on actual allocation * includes HR cost, booth management cost Assumptions while preparing the Cost Estimate Majority of the operational unit cost is based on the experience of nation-wide Measles-Rubella campaign carried out in 2020. Fiscal Year in Nepal starts on 15 July each year, and the allocated amount is sufficient to be spent by the end of the current fiscal year. GON will allocate more budget in the next fiscal year (starting 16 July) Unit cost for vaccinating per person is N PR 103.31 (equivalent to US$ 0.88). Given the allocation scenario, there is no funding gap to carry out COVID-19 vaccination program. In November 2020, The Council of Ministers has approved the 'Proposal for Ensuring Resource Requirements for COVID- 19 Vaccine' with US$ 12,151,222 for operational costs for vaccinating 20% of the population, with GON funding up to US$ 83,016,177 for vaccinating 71.6% of the total population. Ministry of Finance has already provided Ministry of Health and Population NPR 2,500,000,000 (US$ 21,236,833) for COVID-19 vaccination. 52 10. ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOWING IMMUNIZATION 10.1 Introduction An Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) is any untoward medical event that follows immunization, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the immunization. The adverse event may be any unfavorable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding symptom, or disease.12 This definition will continue to be used to identify and report all AEFIs following COVID-19 vaccination. Department of Drug Administration (DDA), the National Regulatory Authority of Nepal, will choose safe and effective available COVID-19 vaccine. However, like any other pharmaceutical product, vaccines are not completely risk-free, and AEFI may result from vaccination. The existing AEFI surveillance network will be used for all AEFI following COVID-19 vaccination. The AEFI surveillance system of Nepal is capable of systematically picking safety signals as well as leading to policy introductions based on AEFI surveillance.13 The surveillance system including reporting, investigation, and causality assessment in Nepal is conducted as per WHO guidelines for AEFI surveillance14 and causality assessment15. Further, guidance for COVID-19 vaccine AEFI surveillance16 will be adopted for the COVID- 19 vaccination program. The overall goal of AEFI surveillance is to ensure that vaccines are administered safely, trust in vaccines is sustained, vaccine safety is monitored, and AEFI is managed properly and promptly. COVID-19 vaccination program will involve vaccinating large and wider population over a short period of time. This may lead to increased reporting of AEFI, especially co-incidental events. Further, immunization error should not occur so that the vaccination program is implemented smoothly, and trust in vaccination is maintained. AEFI training will be an integral part of the COVID-19 vaccination program training, and will be given to health workers, vaccinators, spokesperson focusing on injection safety policies, AEFI management (including for prompt management of anaphylaxis) and surveillance. Intensive monitoring and supervision will be done from all levels to ensure the injection safety policy, AEFI surveillance and risk communication are followed at all levels. As the target population in the vaccination program are adults, immunization stress related responses (ISRR) might occur. Advocacy and counselling will be done at the session sites. Risk communication to the public and to health care workers are critically important at each level. Plan for this is given in 11.10 AEFI crisis communication. 12 Report of CIOMS/WHO Working Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance.

License : CC BY- NC-SA 3.0 IGO 53 Specific objectives of AEFI surveillance Promptly detect, report, and respond to AEFI (serious AEFI, clusters) Identify cause-specific type of AEFI through causality assessment Promptly identify programmatic errors and implement corrective measures Document rates and types of AEFI for specific vaccine in specific population and specific target population Identify signals of unexpected adverse events that would need further confirmation and planned studies Sustain confidence of the public, health functionaries, and professionals on the vaccines and immunization program Use findings of AEFI surveillance to improve immunization program The overall responsibility of implementing AEFI surveillance will lie with Child Health and Immunization Service Section, Family Welfare Division, Department of Health Services in close collaboration with the Department of Drug Administration, and technical support from WHO-IPD. 10.2 Strengthening the AEFI surveillance system There is a functional AEFI surveillance system in place to detect report, investigate, and assess causality of serious AEFI in Nepal. The AEFI surveillance cycle (Fig. 12) outlines the different steps in identification (detection), notification, reporting, investigation, data analysis, causality assessment and feedback following all AEFI, including AEFI following COVID-19 immunization. Figure 12: AEFI Surveillance Cycle (adopted from WHO COVID-19 Vaccines Safety Surveillance Manual) Necessary adaptation will be made in existing forms and formats (rapid reporting form, line- listing, and investigation form) to accommodate COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance as per WHO guideline16. Particular attention to the brand name of the vaccine, manufacturer along with details such as batch numbers and documentation of dates, as well as contraindications and special populations (such as pregnancy, lactation) will be documented. The network of 54 Surveillance Medical Officers, WHO-IPD, will provide technical support at field level for AEFI investigation. 10.3 Training to health care workers As is the case for all immunization trainings including in all vaccination campaigns and new vaccine introductions, all vaccinators and related health care workers in COVID-19 vaccination progr am will be trained on types, causes, identification, prevention, management and reporting of AEFI including anaphylaxis. As anaphylaxis will required prompt action, training will be focused on identification and management of anaphylaxis. Training on signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, difference between immunization stress related response (vasovagal syncope and general) and anaphylaxis17, steps on management of anaphylaxis, administration of adrenaline , etc., will be given to vaccinators and health care workers. Anaphylaxis management manual has also been included in the operational guideline. Job-aid for vaccinators is also developed focusing on identification and management of AEFI. The vaccinators will also be trained on immunization error and its prevention during the COVID-19 vaccination program. All vaccinators will be trained on preventive measures to be followed to avoid immunization error during vaccination. Figure 13: Dose of adrenaline and type of syringe for administration (from training package) 10.4 Risk communication regarding AEFI An effective risk communication action plan as part of the overall advocacy and social mobilization strategy for the COVID-19 vaccination campaign will be developed for minimizing the possible negative repercussions of any AEFI and other causes for public concern around vaccine-related issues. Effective communication is critical during COVID-19 17 Immunization stress-related response. A manual for program managers and health professionals to prevent, identify and respond to stress related responses following immunization. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2019. Licence: CC BY- NC- SA 3.0 IGO. 55 vaccination keeping in mind the crisis identification, designing of messages based on the target audience, identification of key stakeholders, and identification of key channels of communication. Lack of timely information can have consequences on vaccine confidence, vaccine safety, and risk communication. Orientation will be given to media personnel and professional associations before the vaccination program providing information on importance of vaccination, and to inform about possible AEFI. Media engagement and regular information to journalists will be provided to foster good relationship highlighting importance of vaccination. Spokesperson Appropriate government spokesperson will be identified in each level (federal, provincial, and district level) in advance before the vaccination program. All AEFI related communication will be delivered through the spokesperson. The spokesperson will also be train ed along with health staff and other stakeholders in practical aspects such as addressing questions posed by the public, building trust, creating messages for communications, and addressing mainstream media and social media. This limits the possibility of conflicting messages coming from different sources. After receiving feedback from the National AEFI Investigation Comm ittee, the spokesperson will share the findings as required. Selection criteria of spokesperson are as given below. At federal level, existing spokesperson of Ministry of Health and Population or person appointed by Department of Health Services. At provincial level, Provincial Health Director or person appointed by the director At district level, Chief of Health Office or person appointed by the chief. At palika (municipality/local) level, Chief of Health Section of Municipality Office. Spokesperson should have sound knowledge on importance of vaccine, National Immunization Program, AEFI surveillance, and the COVID-19 vaccination program. Spokesperson should have knowledge on types of AEFI, possible AEFI that can be seen during the campaign, expected adverse reactions, as well as rate adverse reactions. Spokesperson should have knowledge about information that should be timely shared to the media person and community. Spokesperson should have experience to interact with media personnel 10.5 AEFI management plan and team AEFI management plan and team will be formed at provincial, district, and municipality levels. Provincial Health Directorate (provincial level) and Health Offices (district level) will be responsible for providing support to the municipality level for AEFI surveillance and investigation of AEFI. This will be done in coordination with hospitals (government and private). Each immunization session site will have trained AEFI focal person. The Health Office will designate AEFI management centres within the districts. 56 All assigned doctors and health workers will be trained for AEFI management. In every AEFI management centre, one physician will be appointed as a coordinator, and at least one health assistant or senior auxiliary health worker, and one staff nurse or auxiliary nurse mid-wife will be a member of the AEFI management team. Larger hospitals will have larger AEFI management team. Each vaccination team in each vaccination session will be provided with an AEFI kit , and necessary training to manage AEFI and for referral. Each vaccination team in each vaccination session will be trained and capable to identify anaphylaxis and administer adrenaline promptly. Figure 14: AEFI kit box containing adrenaline ampoules and syringes, immunization session 10.6 Reporting and investigation of AEFI Case detection and reporting are the first important steps in AEFI surveillance. The primary reporter will be a field health worker (vaccinator), clinic or hospital staff, a volunteer, parent or any other person who detects AEFI. The existing AEFI reporting system will be used with necessary adapt ation for COVID-19 vaccination. Minor AEFIs will be recorded in the tally sheets and AEFI recording registers (Fig. 15). This will be compiled by municipalities and districts levels. The compiled reports will be reported through the district reporting formats within 7 days of the end of each phase. During the vaccination days, all AEFI numbers and types will also be reported daily to MOHP by the Provincial Health Directorate. 57 Figure 15: AEFI recording registers A serious AEFI is an event that results in death, hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or is life-threatening or is a medically important event or reaction.14 All serious AEFI will be reported and investigated promptly (Table 11). Reporting and investigation forms, and investigation processes, will be used as per WHO guidance for COVID-19 vaccines safety surveillance16. Surveillance Medical Officers, WHO-IPD, will provide technical support for field investigation. If required, members from National AEFI Investigation Committee will provide technical support for field investigation. The events post-vaccination that would be reported for COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance includes: Serious AEFI Signals and events associated with the new vaccine Clusters of events, especially unexpected events AEFI that may have been caused by an immunization error Significant events of unexplained cause Events causing significant beneficiary or community concern. 58 Table 11: Timeline and processes for reporting and investigation of serious AEFI 10.7 Causality assessment and National AEFI Investigation Committee The National AEFI Investigation Committee is the committee mandated by the Immunization Act 2072 (2016) of Nepal. It is a multi-disciplinary, independent, and functional AEFI Committee for proper investigation and causality assessment of AEFI. Since COVID-19 vaccination program would be for wider age groups beyond the regular immunization program, the National AEFI Investigation Committee will invite multi-disciplinary experts (for e.g., cardiologists, anesthesiologists, neurologists, geriatricians, etc.) as per need and nature of the serious AEFI under investigation. The committee will systematically review data about the AEFI case(s) to determine the likelihood of a causal association between the event and the vaccine(s) received. The National AEFI Investigation Committee follows the WHO guideline and tools for causality assessment15, which will be continued for adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination16. Vaccine safety data sharing will be done to NRA (Department of Drug Administration), and as per need regionally, globally and to the manufacturers through the NRA, maintaining confidentiality and ethics on data sharing. The committee will regularly monitor the safety profile of the vaccine, risks, and guide the safety of the COVID-19 vaccination program. Immediate Vaccinator/AEFI focal person will immediately inform to the in-charge of the health facility As soon as possible Health facility in-charge, vaccinator, AEFI focal person will fill the AEFI reporting form (rapid reporting form) and submit to the Health Office and inform spokespersons/focal persons of Health Office (district), province and federal levels. Within 24 hours Health office will submit AEFI reporting form to Provincial Health Directorate and Family Welfare Division, Department of Health Services As soon as possible Detail case investigation will be started and completed by the AEFI investigation team, which will include related expert(s), health section chief from the municipality (local level), focal person from Health Office (district level), health facility in-charge/chief, focal person from Provincial Health Directorate (province level), and clinician from district hospital. Within 7 days Detail investigation report will be submitted to Provincial Health Directorate and Family Welfare Division, Department of Health Services, by the AEFI investigation team through the Health Office59 11. COMMUNICATION, INFORMATION, AND SOCIAL MOBILIZATION 11.1 Introduction Building vaccine confidence among the groups anticipated to receive early vaccination, as well as dispelling vaccine-related myths and misinformation are critical to ensure vaccine uptake. Clear, transparent, evidence based, and effective communication is essential to implement a successful vaccine introduction in Nepal. Communication and social mobilization activities will be designed and implemented to ensure timely, effective, transparent and equitable communication of the COVID-19 vaccination program, which will focus on phased wise implementation based on vaccine availability. The interventions will be 1) social and behavioral data-driven, 2) consistent with one another, 3) address the public needs, 4) delivered through trusted sources of communication channels, and 5) implemented together with the community and networks. The proposed communication framework will be based on the WHO SAGE values framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, which underpins the public health objectives and principles of vaccine prioritization for target populations during vaccine supply constraints. Guiding principles of communication and social mobilization interventions will follow a) coordinated communication and consistent messaging, b) fostering transparency and building trust through partnerships, c) embracing diversity, and d) prioritizing with equity . Objectives To provide timely, accurate, and focused messages on vaccine availability date, safety, timeline, and phased approach. To improve understanding and acceptance of the importance of phased and prioritization of vaccine administration. To create public demand and confidence on efficacy and effectiveness of the new COVID-19 vaccine. To timely address rumors, misinformation, and vaccine hesitancy among the general public as well as among the targeted occupational and professional groups. To continue the practice of public health safety measures (use of mask, hand washing/use of sanitizers, physical distancing) even after vaccination. To foster collaboration with other line ministries, private sectors, and formal networks for demand management, vaccine deployment, and administration. 11.2 Target Audiences 1. General public: vaccine eagerness and hesitance groups, with focus on groups to be vaccinated phase-wise, health workers, frontline workers, elderly people, people with co morbidity 2. Professional associations, media, academia, alternative medical practitioners such as Ayurveda practitioners 3. Elected representatives (federal and provincial parliamentarians, mayors, deputy mayors with focus on female representatives), influential political and social leaders 60 4. Community leaders (Female Community Health Volunteers, teachers and other stakeholders) 11.3 Elements of strategy The proposed objectives will be achieved through integrated advocacy, digital and mainstream media mobilization, and engagement of community volunteers, influencers, and frontline line workers. As COVID-19 vaccine is new, it is important to ensure high-level political commitment and ownership at different phases. It is equally important to enhance the capacity of all stakeholders responsible for the implementation of communication actions at all levels through training and orientations. The existing immunization coordination committees at all levels (up to ward and palika in local level) will adapt, plan, implement, monitor, and report all communication and social mobilization activities based on guidance from the federal level. 11.4 Advocacy Advocacy interventions will be planned and carried out to create an enabling environment for vaccine introduction, high level political and bureaucratic support, and leveraging commitment and resources. High-level political support will be secured for providing coherent, correct and evidence-based messages. Advocacy meetings will be carried out with parliamentarians, relevant ministries, medical professional associations, media, influential experts, civil society networks, development partners, media agencies, and religious leaders for ownership, commitment, and support for the approved vaccination plan. Announcement of the vaccination program by high-level policy authorities will be planned at the federal, provincial, and municipality/palika (local) level. 11.5 Social mobilization and community engagement The social mobilization interventions will focus on disseminating factual, timely, and appropriately contextualized information about the vaccine. Social mobilization and community engagement will be contextualized to the province and local level and urban-rural settings. All social mobilization and community engagement efforts will be social and behavioral data-driven to understand the concerns beliefs, grievances, communication channels, and misinformation. Female community health volunteers (FCHVs) are highly appreciated by the community and acknowledged as the trusted source of health information. The large network of FCHVs, teachers, and community leaders and volunteers will be capacitated and mobilized to disseminate timely and appropriate messages at the household and community level. Community-based groups, religious leaders, political and elected members, and youth groups will be engaged to gain acceptance for the vaccine roll out plan and for vaccine uptake as per the plan. 11.6 Risk communication Since COVID-19 vaccine is new and developed in short time frame, communicating about vaccine safety is important. Vaccine safety messages will be reinforced through mass media, 61 social media and community engagement interventions to explain the benefits and risks of the recommended/used vaccine and addressing public concerns and persistent rumors about vaccine safety. The risk communication will strengthen to address public concerns about vaccine safety in a clear, factual and timely manner. 11.7 Media Engagement MOHP will partner with media houses to influence vaccine perceptions across the wider public in three phases a) pre-vaccine b) during vaccine roll-out and 3) post vaccine introduction. COVID-19 vaccine management secretariat with support from media crisis hub will be responsible for rapid and effective crisis management to address, misinformation, rumors, grievances. Mechanism will be established for regular monitoring of mainstream and local print, electronic media, and digital media platforms for real-time monitoring and tracking of the large volume of conversations on the COVID-19 vaccination theme. Listening to the public concerns, conveying to the spokesperson/committee, and reporting back to the public using hotlines, media briefs and other platforms to ensure transparency, trust, and acceptance. 11.8 Feedback mechanism and social listening Social listening or community feedback mechanism will be established to detect rumors, misinformation and distrust as well as real time insights into concerns and perceptions. Community feedback/social listening will be done through surveys, hotline calls, social and mainstream media monitoring, consultations with local leaders, community partners, health workers, and influential ensuring participation from the marginalized groups. Regular briefs will be developed and disseminated that synthesize multiple online and offline sources of data, identify signals and trends, describe current narratives, and provide recommendations and guidance. Community feedback will be addressed through mass media, social media, existing MOHP press briefs and other appropriate channels. There will be designated focal persons for AEFI, and designated spokespersons for AEFI at all levels. The same hotline (1115, 1133) used for COVID-19, which is well known to general public, will also be used for COVID-19 vaccines to answer public questions, concerns, and to provide information. 11.9 Capacity building of key stakeholders Health workers as the first beneficiaries of the COVID-19 vaccine and a trusted source of communication will be imparted with listening, interpersonal communication, and community dialogue skills to engage with vaccine eager, hesitance, and recipient groups. One-day training will be conducted for FCHVs, teachers, volunteers and other community- based group members to equip them with communication skills and vaccine-related message. Leaflets, posters, frequently asked questions flyer, and explainer videos will be developed and distributed for mass awareness. Spokespersons at federal and provincial level will be capacitated for AEFI and crisis communication. 62 11.10 AEFI crisis communication As the COVID-19 vaccine is new, there will likely be public concerns over the safety and possible side effects. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) will be established for processes of evaluating a situation and determining any actions, and subsequent efforts to monitor the situation and agree any further communications on adverse events following immunization (AEFI) which could be coincidental or in rare cases vaccine-related. Standard content and guidance will be developed to mitigate rumors, misinformation, and disinformation through one voice. A selected spokesperson will be trained on crisis communication and communicating with the affected populations as well as others in the case of AEFI. The existing AEFI communication core team will be responsible for managing and supporting the AEFI communication. AEFI crisis communication will be part of all national, provincial, and municipality (palika) level training program. Roles and responsibilities of different people will be clearly spelled out, e.g., spokespersons, EPI managers, health workers, vaccinators, social mobilizers, etc. 11.11 Coordination and collaboration National Health Education, Information and Communication Center with support from National COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Committee (COVAC ) will provide technical guidance and support all media and communication-related interventions at the federal level. A working group comprising members from NHEICC, FED, UNICEF, WHO, and other experts will be formed for the development, pre-testing, and finalization of the communication messages and materials. The materials and messages will be endorsed by the National Immunization Advisory Committee for further adaptation and dissemination at the provincial and local levels. Collaboration and coordination with line ministries, private sectors, associations and networks will be established to foster demand and dissemination of standard messages and materials. Note: Around 20 video PSAs regarding COVID-19 vaccine, vaccine safety, etc., have already been developed by MOHP and widely disseminated through Government platforms (in cluding MOHP's Facebook and Viber ) and partners platforms (Annex 1). Hotline for COVID-19 vaccine is fully operation al (1115, 1133). FAQs on COVID-19 vaccine are already developed and disseminated widely through various platforms. Various webinars on COVID-19 vaccines has been conducted. Some of the IEC materials prepared are given below. 63 Figure 16: IEC material showing hotline numbers for COVID-19 vaccine information Figure 17: IEC material showing prevention measures for COVID-19, symptoms and contact information 64 Figure 18: General information to public regarding COVID-19 vaccination Figure 19: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) pamphlet for COVID-19 vaccination 65 Figure 20: COVID-19 vaccination poster with information on session sites, dates, and target group 66 12. RECORDING AND REPORTING Recording and reporting will be done as per the guideline developed for COVID-19 vaccination. Basically, recording will be paper-based and at the place of vaccination. Adequate information will be collected for monitoring, reporting, future planning and evaluation of the program. Figure 21: Reporting and feedback mechanism for COVID-19 vaccination Recording register, vaccination card and reporting forms A format for health facilities / ward for line listing of target population will include name, contact address, age, sex, risk group and identification documents / number Immunization register Based on current immunization register, the National Immunization Program NIP will prepare immunization register for COVID-19 vaccination as the target group is different and more information will be needed. It will include all information as in vaccination card and contact information for second dose reminders and enquiry for safety concerns. Tally sheets 67 Tally sheets will be used to count the number of vaccinations administered during campaign. Tally sheets will be re-designed to get information on age groups, co-morbidity and occupational status. Printing of the register and vaccination cards will be done at federal level for the uniformity of information collection and supplied to each palika. These registers will be kept safely at designated health facilities for second dose follow-up and review of AEFI cases in the future. Vaccination card Each vaccinated person will get a vaccination card. The vaccination card will have two sides (counter-foil), with the detachable part provided to the vaccinated person (Fig. 9, middle part), and the remaining counter-foil kept at the health facility (Fig. 9, left part). The back side of the vaccination card provided to the vaccinated person will have information on the vaccine given including minor expected reactions, interval between the doses given, measures for protection against COVID-19 as well as information on routine immunization (Fig. 9, right part). The vaccination card will include following information. Personal information (names, age, sex, address) Different columns for each anticipated dose The date of vaccination, vaccine product name, dose number, batch or lot number, and the name of the institution / health facility providing the vaccination and vaccinator name. The health facility copy will also include contact information of the beneficiary. The information on the second dose will be provided to the vaccinated person during the first dose vaccination by the staff at the immunization session, and information (interval) is also provided on the back side of the vaccination card provided to the beneficiary. The exact dates for second doses by category/phase will be announced nationally by MOHP, and accordingly by all levels. Those missing second dose will be followed with the contact information recorded at the health facility copy of the vaccination card. The summary of the records will be compiled in the reporting form by every health facility and send to the Local Government (palika level). Palika will send the compiled report electronically (whenever possible) to district, district to province and province to federal government. Provinces and federal government will compile the reported information and make it public. The summary will include major achievements, challenges faced, and lessons learnt. The planning, recording and reporting forms will be as given below. All these forms are already developed (in Nepali) and included in the COVID-19 vaccination guideline, and the health care workers and volunteers will be trained accordingly. Similar format has been used by the health care workers in the past for nation-wide vaccination campaigns, and the health care workers are familiar with the format and sequence of these forms. Further, Provincial Health Directorate will report aggregate achievements daily to MOHP on vaccination days. 68 Form No. 1 : Form for updating the details of target group by ward/health facility Form No. 2 : Form for basic information of ward/health facility and estimation of immunization materials Form No. 3 : Form for municipality level basic information and compilation of the estimated quantity of immunization materials Form No. 4 : Form for district level basic information and compilation of the estimated quantity of immunization materials Form No. 5 : Form for municipality level planning of estimation of education materials and recording/ reporting forms (to prepare during district level planning workshop) Form No. 6 : Form for municipality level planning of estimation of vaccine and cold chain equipment including the details of cold chain management (to prepare/compile during district level planning workshop) Form No. 7 : Form for municipality level planning of IEC and social mobilization activities (to prepare/compile during district level planning workshop) Form No. 8 : Form for municipality level planning of details of unreached, poor coverage or high-risk area for immunization services (to prepare/compile during district level planning workshop) Form No. 9 : Social map of ward or municipality Form No. 10 : Checklist for supervision/monitoring of pre-campaign preparations and campaign implementation Form No. 11 : Tally sheet for the use in immunization session/booth during vaccination against COVID-19 Form No. 12 : Health facility/ward level progress report form for immunization campaign conducted against COVID-19 Form No. 13 : Municipality/district level progress report form for immunization campaign conducted against COVID-19 Form No. 14 : District level planning form for the management, treatment of AEFI cases and its referral Form No. 15 : Adverse event following immunization (AEFI) reporting form Form No. 16 : Adverse event following immunization (AEFI) investigation form 69 13. HUMAN RESOURCES AND TRAINING COVID-19 vaccination may present several new challenges, including more for vaccine handling and storage requirements, immunization schedules, and targeting of population outside the routine immunization system. 13.1 Human resources for COVID-19 vaccination Nepal has a success story in various immunization campaign like measles rubella campaign, JE campaign, and Tetanus toxoid campaign using the existing immunization structure. These campaigns have been successfully completed in the past and will be the backbone for COVID- 19 vaccination campaign. There are more than 8000 trained vaccinators in Nepal who conduct regular immunization session. There are about 16000 routine immunization sessions (fixed and outreach) conducted every month. In addition, mid-level health workers working in the health facilities (around 7000) also provide immunization services. There are more than 4000 health facilities spread all over the country and having at least two health workers to provide regular immunization. They are also involved in various national campaigns. Health workers and vaccinators training (including for AEFI) is part of all campaigns and new vaccine introductions. In 2020, Nepal conducted nation-wide measles rubella campaign, and introduced rotavirus vaccine in its routine immunization. Health workers were widely trained during this. Further, in the last quarter of 2020, provincial level training or trainers on immunization for all provinces including district staff have been completed. For COVID-19 vaccination, all related health workers at all levels will be trained. The required IPC measures will be implemented in each training. Frequent virtual training will be provided from the federal level to all levels as per need. 13.2 Planning of training Training for COVID-19 will be developed at each level. The training will follow cascaded modality and conducted in following levels. Federal level : Training of trainers (federal and provincial level health workers) Provincial level : Training of district level trainers (health workers from district) District Level : Training of health workers and vaccinator Local level : Training for social mobilization (FCHVs, other volunteers, other health workers) Regular virtual training from central level core technical team will be provided to all levels regularly. For e.g., training to nation-wide AEFI focal persons. 70 13.4 Training methodology Power point presentation, discussion and demonstration, hands-on-practice, evaluation and feedback will be used during training. Major content of the training Introduction of COVID-19 vaccination program Vaccine information, characteristics Cold chain maintenance Micro-planning Management of vaccination booth/session Recording and reporting AEFI management Social mobilization and communication Waste management Supervision and monitoring All the training will be monitored to ensure the quality of the training, especially at the service delivery levels by provincial and district supervisors. Figure 22: Planning of training by each level and participants 71 14. SUPERVISION AND MONITORING 14.1 Supervision and monitoring Supervision and monitoring will be an integral part of COVID-19 vaccination program. Supervision and monitoring will take place from all three levels of the government. Federal level will supervise intensively during the planning phase including logistics up to municipal level. Federal and provincial governments jointly will look after the quality of the vaccination program. Provincial government will monitor the planning and training component for the COVID-19 vaccination program at sub-provincial level. They will also support, supervise and monitor in logistics arrangement. The local level will supervise and monitor the implementation of the vaccination program in their respective health facilities and municipality. Table 12: Level of supervision and their responsible offices Level of Government Major areas to cover Responsible Office Federal Planning, training, logistics, quality assurance Family Welfare Division ; Management Division Provincial Planning, training, logistics, quality assurance Provincial Health Directorate; Provincial Health Logistics Management Centre Local Planning, training, logistics, quality assurance; Implementation Health Section, Municipality Office A supervision plan will be prepared at all levels with identification of responsible persons. Supervision will be carried out at three stages of the vaccination program: 1) Pre-vaccination : to assess the readiness for vaccination (micro planning, health worker, cold chain status), 2) Vaccination: to monitor the vaccination activities, progress and support in vaccination activities, if needed, 3) Post-vaccination stage : to assess the performance, challenges and lesson learned and inform the next phase of vaccination. A checklist (Form no. 10) has been prepared to assess the preparedness for vaccination at district, palika and ward / health facility level and session observation during vaccination. The progress of vaccination will be continuously monitored to assess the program performance. The key performance indicators used to assess the program will be as follows. Vaccination coverage by phase Sessions planned versus sessions conducted Full immunization rates, and drop-out rates AEFI reported against number of beneficiaries vaccinated (especially immunization error, and serious AEFI promptly managed) Vaccine wastage rates Budget utilization rates 72 14.2 Readiness assessment prior to vaccination Effective implementation of vaccination will require high quality preparedness at all levels. Based on the experience of past measles rubella vaccination campaign, a preparedness assessment at all levels will be conducted using a standards checklist. The assessment will be conducted in national, provincial, district and municipality level. The assessment will be carried out by the supervisors from national, provincial and district level supervisors. The assessment will focus on preparedness activities status for COVID-19 vaccination in the following areas. Planning and coordination Identification of resources Prioritization of beneficiaries Micro-planning Training and supervision Monitoring and evaluation Vaccine/logistic calculations and cold chain plan Preparation for safety surveillance (AEFI surveillance) Demand generation and communication activities 15. EVALUATION Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination will be carried out after the first and second phase of the vaccination. Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC) in collaboration with development partners and research organizations will carry out the evaluation activities. Evaluation methodology will be worked out focusing on program performance, vaccine uptake and safety, and cohort analysis for effectiveness. 73 16.

BACKGROUND The Constitution of Nepal states that every citizen has the right to a clean environment (part 3, article 30) and right to free basic health services from the state as well as equal access to health services (part 3, article 35) (NLC 2015). The government of Nepal has focused its efforts in providing good quality of health services to all the people in the country. However, Nepal government is facing different types of challenges associated with communicable and non- communicable disease. One of the major problems is proper management of health care waste (HCW). Poor Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) leads to environmental pollution and carries the risk of infections. Health care waste not only affect the waste generators but also the waste handlers and the general public. One direct effect of poor HCWM is the alarming incidence of nosocomial infection s. As defined by WHO, health-care waste is the by-product of health care that includes sharps, non- sharp blood contaminated items, blood, body parts and tissues, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and radioactive materials (WHO 2019). In addition, it includes the same types of waste originating from minor and scattered sources, including waste produced in the course of health care undertaken in the home (e.g. home dialysis, self-administration of insulin, recuperative care). Between 75% and 90% of the waste produced by health-care providers is comparable to domestic waste and usually called \"non -hazardous\" or \"general health -care waste\". It comes mostly from the administrative, kitchen and housekeeping functions at health-care facilities and may also include packaging waste and waste generated during maintenance of health-care buildings. The remaining 10 -25% of health- care waste is regarded as \"hazardous\" and may pose a variety of environmental and health risks (WHO 2017). Hazardous health-care waste can be categorized as \"Infectious waste \", \"Sharp waste \", \"Pathological waste \", \"Pharmaceutical waste \", \"Cytotoxic waste \", \"Chemical waste \" and \"Radioactive waste \". Non-hazardous general waste is waste that does not pose any biological, chemical, radioactive or physical hazard (WHO 2014) According to new global dat a (WHO/UNICEF 2019) there is no or very limited safe management of health care waste in a large proportion of facilities. The data, representing over 560,000 facilities from 125 countries, indicate that 40% of health care facilities do not segregate waste. In least developed countries, the situation is far worse with only 27% of countries having basic (segregation and safe waste destruction) services. To select an appropriate technology for HCWM, it is essential to know the predicted quantity of waste that will be generated in a facility. Kilograms per occupied bed per day and kg per outpatient per day are used to compare health care facilities with different levels of activities. If inpatient occupancy rates and the daily number of outpatients are not available, the total number of beds is often used to estimate kg of waste per bed per day. The rate of waste generated in different level of hospitals varies significantly, depending upon the service provided, however WHO has estimated 2-4 kg per bed per day total waste with weight volume ratio of 100-200 kg per cum. The health care waste generation of Nepal is in a range of 0.99 to 1.73 kg per bed per day, out of this hazardous waste is 0.33 to 0.59 kg per patient per day (MoH 2003, CSH 2011, DoHS 2015, WHO 2016). Considering the sharp waste management and the occurrence of needle stick injuries among health care workers and informal waste workers, a study conducted in Western region of 2 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Nepal reveals that 70% of clinical staff and 63% of non-clinical staff reported of incidents o f needle stick injury (NSI) or other sharps injury at some time (DoHS 2013, Paudel, Pun and Gurung 2010). A study conducted by M\u00e9decins du Monde France ( (MdM 2018)) on 1278 informal waste workers (IWW) of Kathmandu Valley and Nuwakot districts showed that 38% reported handling medical waste and 66% had been injured at work in the past 12 months. The most common injury were cuts, exposing the IWWs to further risks. Furthermore, most of the IWWs did not know about their infectious disease status (HIV, hepatitis B and C) and 68% admitted to not using any form of personal protective equipment (PPE), exposing the IWWs to greater risks. Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) aims to improve the health care waste management system, as stated in Nepal health sector strategy Implementation Plan 2016-2021. Outcome 2 \"Improved Quality of care at point of delivery\", states imp roved infection prevention and health care waste management as one of its outputs. The proposed key intervention activities to achieve these outputs are the review and revision of the infection prevention and health care waste management as well as the promotion of public private partnerships (PPPs) models for waste management. Improper management of HCW in the HCFs is mainly responsible for generating high volume of hazardous wastes. Thus, proper minimization, segregation, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes will greatly reduce the risks to public health. The mismanagement of HCW especially burning contributes to air pollution and eventually to global warming through emission of different greenhouse gases. Early recovery of the patient and health of clinical staf f directly depends on infection prevention practices used in HCFs. Health care waste management is considered as one of the essential components of good infection prevention practices. Fifteenth five- year plan 2019/20 to 2023/24 has an action plan for provincial and local governments to take responsibility for the management of hospital and other health institution and laboratory waste and pharmaceutical waste. Based on Public Health Service Act 2075 (2018), Public Health Service Regulation 2077 (2020), Solid Waste Management Act 2068 (2011) with edited version in 2074 Kartik and National Health Policy 2076 (2019), Health Care Waste Management Guideline 2014 has been updated and revised to this form as HCWM Standards and Operating Procedures. This document is further divided into two parts, standards and operating procedures for a safe and efficient HCWM system for HCFs in Nepal. HCFs have the prime responsibility of ensuring that there are no adverse health and environmental consequences during handling, storage, treatment and disposal of HCWs. 1.1. OBJECTIVES OF THIS DOCUMENT HCFs will be able to implement appropriate waste management systems and approaches that can provide benefits such as: Protection of public health by reducing the exposure of employees, patients, visitors and the entire community to hazardous HCWs in the work environment Environment protection through waste minimization and promotion of environment friendly technology for safe disposal of HCW Facilitate the implementation of a proper health care waste management system by providing guidelines for federal, provincial and local government as well as user friendly manuals for the health care facilities 3 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Facilitate compliance with applicable legal requirements (e.g. Minimum Service Standard of HCFs, standard for WASH in HCFs and standard for health institution establishment, operation and upgrade etc.) Reduce possible risks through better waste handling; improving infection prevention practices within the health care facility and other health facilities outlets like laboratories. Facilitate health facilities to select best environmentally friendly treatment and disposal option based on available technologies in the country's context. 1.2. SCOPE OF THE STANDARDS AND OPERATING PROCEDURES The scope of this standard and operating procedure document is to support federal, provincial and local government as well as all levels of health care facilities for the implementation of a safe health care waste management system, based on the best available technologies and best environmental practice in the country context. This document is developed with the vision for obligatory compliance by the provincial and local level. The target audience of the guideline are national authorities (federal to local) involved with health care waste management, health care practitioners at all levels (including laboratories), waste management service providers; public health professionals, private sector, veterinary, I/NGO, CBO, outreach clini c, pharmacies, Medical/ health camp and other relevant stakeholders and individuals involved in health care waste management. 2. DEFINITIONS , SOURCE AND CATEGORIZATION OF HEALTH CARE WASTE HCW embraces all waste generated during all medical activities. Medic al activities include activities such as diagnosis, preventive, curative and palliative treatments, research pertaining to the above activities and production or testing of biologicals. This also includes the waste generated during required administrative and other activities. Sources of HCW are: Hospitals Primary health care centres, health posts, sub-health posts, Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) clinics, primary health care outreach clinics (PHC ORC) Clinics (medical, primary health care, alternative medicines, dental, maternity homes, dialysis centres, physician offices) Laboratories and research centres (medical and biomedical laboratories, medical research centres and institutions, blood banks and blood collection centres, biotechnology laboratories, pathological laboratories, microbiological laboratories) Pharmacies and medical stores Institutions (medical, nursing home, dental, nursing, paramedics, drug rehabilitation centres, drop- in centre) Mortuary and autopsy centres Veterinary hospitals and clinics Ambulance and emergency care Home based care Solid Waste Management Act 2068 (2011) with edited version in 2074 Kartik, defines health care waste as 'waste generated from hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, blood banks, pathology laboratories, veterinary institutions or health research centres which can be hazardous to human health and 4 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 environment'. Based on the various physical and chemical properties and hazards associated with the waste, HCW are broadly categorized into general healthcare waste and hazardous healthcare waste. 2.1 GENERAL WASTE General HCW, also known as non-hazardous HCW. This waste does not pose any biological, chemical, radioactive or physical hazard and is comparable to domestic waste. It is usually generated from the administrative and house-keeping services of HCFs. Examples of such wastes include general office waste, garden or yard waste, packaging and food waste. These wastes can be composted to make manure, recycled or be managed by the municipal waste services. Researches have shown that general HCW constitutes about 75% to 90% of the total amount of HCW generated by HCFs ( (WHO 2014)). General HCWs are classified into the following categories: 2.1.1 Biodegradable This category of waste consists of the waste that can be composted. Examples are left over food scraps or garden waste. 2.1.2 Non-biodegradable This category of general waste includes all the health care waste, that does not decompose, but of which a rather large volume can be recycled, and remaining waste can be disposed in a sanitary landfill. There are various sub-categories for other general, recyclable, waste. Examples of common sub-categories are bottles and cans, paper, different plastics and glass. 2.2 HAZARDOUS WASTE Hazardous waste poses a risk or hazard to human health and/or to the environment. This category of HCW constitutes the waste which needs special attention for handling and management. Researches have shown that hazardous HCWs constitute about 10% to 25% of the total amount of HCWs generated by HCFs. Hazardous wastes are further classified as follows: 2.2.1 Infectious Waste Infectious wastes are any wastes which suspected to contain pathogens and that poses a risk of disease transmission. This category includes waste contaminated with blood and other body fluids, laboratory cultures and microbiological stocks and waste including excreta and other materials that have been in contact with patients infected with highly infectious diseases (e.g Isolation ward of, Ebola, COVID-19).; or waste from any infected patients in isolation wards 2.2.2 Sharp Waste Sharps are all objects and materials capable of cutting or penetrating the skin. These wastes pose a potential risk of injury and infection due to their puncturing or cutting properties. For this reason, used or unused sharp wastes (e.g. hypodermic, intravenous or other blades; broken glass) whether or not they are infected, such items are usually considered highly hazardous health-care waste and should be treated as if they were potentially infected. . Used sharp waste may be contaminated with blood, body fluid, microbiological materials and toxic or cytotoxic substances and must be managed with utmost care. Sharp waste may be further categorized into glass sharps and metal sharps. 5 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 2.2.3 Pathological Waste Pathological waste consists of human body parts, organs and tissues. Examples of such wastes are tissue waste, removed organs, amputated body parts, placentas, blood, body fluids, human foetus, animal and carcasses obtained through medical procedures. 2.2.4 Pharmaceutical waste Pharmaceutical waste ranges from normal oxidants to highly specific medicines and includes expired, unused, spilt and contaminated pharmaceutical products, prescribed and proprietary drugs, vaccines and sera that are no longer required, and, due to their chemical or biological nature, need to be disposed of carefully. The category also includes discarded items heavily contaminated during the handling of pharmaceuticals, such as bottles, vials and boxes containing pharmaceutical residues, gloves, masks and connecting tubing 2.2.5 Geno-toxic Cytotoxic waste Technically, genotoxic means toxic to the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); cytotoxic means toxic to the cell; cytostatic means suppressing the growth and multiplication of the cell; antineoplastic means inhibiting the development of abnormal tissue growth; and chemotherapeutic means the use of chemicals for treatment, including cancer therapy. Cytotoxic (chemotherapeutic or antineoplastic) drugs, the principal substances in this category, have the ability to kill or stop the growth of certain living cells and are used in chemotherapy of cancer. They play an important role in the therapy of various neoplastic conditions but are also finding wider application as immunosuppressive agents in organ transplantation and in treating various diseases with an immunological basis. Cytotoxic drugs are most often used in specialized departments, such as oncology and radiotherapy units, whose main role is cancer treatment. Their use in other hospital departments and outside the hospital in clinics and elsewhere is also increasing. 2.2.6 Chemical waste Chemical waste consists of discarded solid, liquid and gaseous chemicals; for example, from diagnostic and experimental work and from cleaning and disinfecting procedures. Chemical waste from health care is considered to be hazardous if it has at least one of the properties like toxic (harmful) , corrosive (e.g. acids of pH <2 and bases of pH >12), flammable , reactive (explosive, water reactive, shock sensitive) or oxidizing. Non-hazardous chemical waste consists of chemicals with none of the above properties; for example, sugars, amino acids and certain organic and inorganic salts, which are widely used in transfusion liquids 2.2.7 Radioactive waste Radioactive waste in HCFs include materials contaminated with radionuclides, which arise from the medical or research use of radionuclides. Examples includes: radioactive substances (such as unused liquids from radiotherapy or laboratory research), glassware, packages, or absorbent paper contaminated with radioactive substance, urine and excreta from patients treated or tested with radionuclides and sealed sources (containers in which radioactive substances are stored and sealed). 2.2.8 E-waste In addition to the outlined categories, safe management of electronic waste has been a great challenge in health facilities of Nepal. Electronic waste ranges from small testing devices to larger equipment for various purposes. This equipment contains a multitude of components, some containing toxic substance, which can have adverse impact on human health and environment if not handled 6 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 properly. Due to improper recycling and disposal practices often these substances are released. With the increasing use of advanced technologies for medical services, generation of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is increasing along with its challenges for proper disposal. Some of the common examples in medical devices are radiotherapy equipment, cardiology, dialysis and pulmonary ventilators, laboratory equipment for in-vitro diagnosis, analysers, freezers, etc. 3. ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH IMPACTS In Nepal, the health care sector and the provided services are expanding at a rapid rate and this has resulted in the generation of large quantities of HCW. HCWs are either being dumped haphazardly or send to landfill site along with domestic waste without pre-treatment. In many cases HCWs are burned in metal drums or just openly. This results in the emissions of by-products and toxic substances into the environment. Improper disposal of HCW pollutes the environment. This happens either directly through the contamination of soil and water sources, or indirectly by releasing toxic gases like dioxin, furan etc. along with residue of some toxic heavy metals like lead, mercury and cadmium as ash. . All individuals exposed to health care waste; especially people handling infectious and sharp waste are potentially at risk of being injured or infected. 3.1 ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT Besides patients and health care personnel, consideration must be given to the impact of HCW to the environment and thus to the general public. Care must also be paid to the pollution of air, water and soil as well as the aesthetic beauty. The dumping of HCW in uncontrolled areas can have a direct environmental effect by contaminating the surroundings including the water sources. Obsolete pesticides (especially Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) used for the control of vectors in HCF), stored in leaking drums or torn bags, can directly or indirectly affect the health of anyone who encounters them. Poisoning can occur through direct contact with the product, inhalation of vapours, drinking of contaminated water, or consumption of contaminated food. Other hazards may include the possibility of fire as a result of inefficient disposal such as burning. Pharmaceutical residues, which may include antibiotics and other drugs, heavy metals such as mercury, phenols and derivatives, and disinfectants and antiseptics may have toxic effects on the natural ecosystems. Mercury has been used over centuries in HCFs. When mercury is released to the environment, e.g. by broken thermometers, sphygmomanometer, due to accidental spills or emissions from the incineration of HCW, an increased risk of various hazards due to acute and chronic exposures are the result. The most common potential mode of occupational exposure to mercury is via inhalation of metallic liquid mercury vapours. Mercury, due to its potent neurotoxic nature, can affect brain, spinal cord, kidneys and the development of children. 3.2 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IMPACT All individuals, who are exposed to hazardous HCWs are potentially at risk of being injured or infected. They include: Medical staff such as doctors, pharmacists, laboratory technologists, nurses, paramedics, sanitary staff and hospital maintenance personn el 7 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 In and outpatients receiving treatment in HCFs, as well as their visitors Workers in support services linked to HCFs such as laundry, waste handling and transportation services Workers in waste disposal facilities, including scavengers The general public, mostly the children playing with the items they can find in the waste outside the HCFs, when it is directly accessible to them. During the handling of waste (especially infectious and sharps), the medical and auxiliary staff as well as the sanitary staffs, can be infected and injured if the waste has not been packed safely. Many injuries occur because needles or other sharps have not been collected in safety boxes or because these have been over filled. The unsafe disposal of HCW (e.g. contaminated syringes and needles) poses health risks to medical personnel or the public. Contaminated needles and syringes create a big threat if there is a failure to dispose them safely. WHO estimates that over 20 million infections of hepatitis B, C and HIV occur yearly due to unsafe injection practices (i.e. the reuse of syringes and needles in the absence of sterilization) and are thus transmitted via HCW ( (Pr\u00fcss-\u00dcst\u00fcn 1999). Infectious waste may contain a variety of pathogenic microorganisms. Pathogens in infectious waste may enter the human body through a puncture, an abrasion or a cut in the skin; through mucous membranes; inhalation or ingestion and can have major adverse effects to the community. 3.3 AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE In the last few years, there has been growing controversy over the incineration of HCWs. Under some circumstances, including when wastes are incinerated at low temperatures than recommended (200-400 degree Celsius) or when plastics that contain polyvinyl chloride (some plastics, blood bags and fluid bags) are incinerated, dioxins, furans and other toxic air pollutants may be produced as emissions, either in bottom ash or in fly ash. Dioxins, furans and co-planar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic substances that do not readily break down in the environment and bio-accumulate in the food chain. Most human exposure to dioxins, furans and co- planar PCBs is through the intake of food. Long-term, low-level exposure of humans to dioxins and furans may lead to the impairment of the immune system, nervous system, endocrine system and reproductive functions. Short-term, high-level exposure may result in skin lesions and altered liver function. The standards set are 0.1 nano gram per Toxic Equivalent per normal cubic meter (ne/TEO/Nm3) (Pr\u00fcss-\u00dcst\u00fcn 1999). Thus, dioxins, furan and mercury emissions from HCFs are major environmental and health challenges. Steps need to be taken to reduce these emissions through waste minimization, and use of environmentally friendly technologies. 4. LEGAL FRAMEWORK , COMMITMENTS AND PRINCIPLES There are several international and national agreements and guidelines concerning the management of waste. A selection of the most relevant policies, legal Provisions and commitments are summarized in the following. 8 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 4.1 INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND UNDERLYING LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PRINCIPLES International agreements have been reached on a number of underlying principles, which govern either public health or safe management of hazardous waste. Nepal is signatory on several international conventions. The conventions and guiding principles outlined here should be taken into consideration while making plans for an appropriate HCWM system in Nepal. 4.1.1 Sustainable Development Goals Sustainable development goals are the goals for implementation aiming at sustainability of the resources by achieving 17 goals. These goals are interconnected with each other and are aimed to be achieved by 2030. Safe health care waste management practices also support a number of sustainable development goals including SDG 3 Good health and wellbeing: In pursuant with Goal 3 of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages and meet the target of reducing deaths and illness from hazardous chemicals, air and water. SDG 6 Clean water and sanitation: In pursuant to Goal 6 of ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, the proper management of HCW can help avoid release of toxicants and meet the target of improving ambient water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials. SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy: In pursuant of Goal 7 ensuring use of appropriate technologies for treatment of health care waste shall aid in assortment of affordable, reliable and sustainable modern energy SDG 12 Responsible consumption and production: In pursuant of Goal 12 to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, environment friendly management of health care waste can further help to promote waste prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse. SDG 13Climate Action: In pursuant of Goal 13 to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, sustainable healthcare waste management practices can further contribute in minimizing greenhouse gas emission and reducing adverse effects of climate change. 4.1.2 WHA Resolution on water, sanitation and hygiene in health care facilities 2019 Member of world health assembly in 2019 have approved a resolution to work toward universal access to WASH, including safe health care waste management in health care facilities. This resolution states all member countries to conduct national assessment and analysis, develop roadmaps and set target and implement standards as a part of global effort to improve WASH in health care facilities and safe management of health care waste. Specifically, efforts are focused on meeting the following targets: Basic services: By 2022, 60% of all health care facilities globally and in each SDG region will have at least basic WASH services. 80% have basic WASH services by 2025, and 100% by 2030. Higher service levels: By 2022, higher levels of service are defined and monitored in countries where universal basic WASH services have been achieved already. By 2030, higher levels of WASH services are achieved universally in 80% of those countries. 9 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 In addition, efforts to improve waste management and reduce the environmental impact of such practices are being addressed through climate smart and green health care facility initiatives, vaccine waste reduction efforts and patient safety campaigns. (WHO/UNICEF 2019) 4.1.3 Minamata Convention (2013) The Minamata Convention on Mercury is a global treaty aimed to protect human health and environment from the adverse effects of exposure to mercury. It was adopted on 10th October 2013 in Japan. The convention entered into force on 16th August 2017 with 128 signatories. Mercury is widely used in health care setting especially in medical equipment such as thermometers and sphygmomanometer. According to high level decision of honourable deputy prime minister and minister for health and population, dated 2076/05/04 (21st August 2019), equipment having mercury and dental alugum are prohibited for pregnant and breast-feeding women. In case of other ages groups, ban in use of mercury dental alugam within 5 years. The school university or academy of dental medicine should revise their curriculum accordingly and use of mercury dental alugum in practical exercises are prohibited. 4.1.4 UN Human Rights Council (2011) In 2011, the UN Human Rights Council found that improper waste management threatens human rights, including the rights of citizen to a clean environment, the right to a safe working environment and the right to life and health. 4.1.5 The Strategic Approach to international Chemical Management (SAICM) (2006) SAICM, an international agreement aims to achieve the sound management of chemicals throughout their lifecycle, no matter where it was generated, by 2020. Nepal agreed to SAICM in 2006, with the implementation falling under the former Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology. SAICM ensure that the chemicals are used and produced in ways that minimize significant adverse effect on human health and the environment. It emphasizes the science-based risk assessment of the chemicals in practice and assess the availability of safer substitutes and their efficacy. 4.1.6 The Dhaka Declaration on Waste Management (2004): Under this declaration, Nepal has pledged for the closure of open-dumping site and for the safe treatment of health care waste, giving priority to non-burn technology. 4.1.7 The Stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants (2001) This Convention is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants (POPs). POPs are toxic chemicals that remain intact in the environment for long periods, become widely distributed geographically and accumulate in the fatty tissue of living organisms. POPs circulate globally and can cause damage wherever they travel. The Stockholm Convention recommends prioritizing alternatives to incineration, which do not produce dioxins and furans. Where incineration cannot be avoided, best available technologies comprising air pollution control devices capable of reducing emissions of dioxins and furans to less than 0.1ng/m3 should be deployed (SSC 2008). Nepal has signed the Stockholm Convention in 2007 (GoN 2017)and the updated National Implementation Plan (NIP) for the Stockholm Convention in Nepal banned the open burning of waste in municipal areas; it aims to ban the open burning of waste not only in municipalities but throughout all areas of the country (GoN 2017). 10 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 4.1.8 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 1992 The principles of the Rio Declaration define the right of people to development, and their responsibilities to safeguard the common environment. The Declaration states that the only way to have long term economic progress is by linking it to environmental protection. Principle 16 of the Rio Declaration states that national authorities should endeavour to promote the internalization of environmental costs and the use of economic instruments, taking into account the approach that the polluter should bear the cost of pollution, with due regard to the public interest and without distorting international trade and investment. 4.1.9 Basel convention 1989 The Basel Convention on the control of trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal w as adopted in 1989 and entered into force in 1992. The central goal of the Basel Convention is \"environmentally sound management\" (ESM), the aim of which is to protect human health and the environment by minimizing hazardous waste production whenever possible. ESM means addressing the issue through an \"integrated life-cycle approach\", which involves strong controls from the generation of a hazardous waste to its storage, transport, treatment, reuse, 4.1.10 Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (1972) Principle 6 of the Declaration addresses the discharge of toxic substances and other substances in quantities or concentration that exceeds the capacity of the environment to render them harmless. It states that such discharges and releases need to be halted in order to ensure that serious or irreversible damage is not inflicted upon ecosystems. 4.1.11 Tort law and principles Tort law is based on the idea that a party that was harmed as the result of a wrongdoing by another party is entitled to compensation for the harm caused. This wrongdoing covers both intentional as well as unintentional wrongdoing (e.g. by negligence). Applied to the context of health care waste management the following principles can be applied. Duty of care principle: any organization that generates waste has a duty to dispose the waste safely. Therefore, it is the HCF that has ultimate responsibility for how waste is containerized, handled on-site and off-site and ultimately treated and disposed of. Precautionary principle: when the magnitude of a particular risk is uncertain, it should be assumed that this risk is significant, and the measures to protect health and safety should be designed accordingly. It must therefore always be assumed that waste is hazardous until it is proved to be safe. This is a key principle governing health and safety protection. Proximity principle: treatment and disposal of hazardous waste should be conducted at the closest possible location to the source to minimize the risks and financial cost involved in its transport. Similarly, any community should recycle or dispose of the waste it produces inside its own territorial limits. Polluter pays principle (PPP): all waste producers are legally and financially responsible for the safe handling and environmentally sound disposal of the waste they produce. In case of accidental pollution, the organization is liable for the costs of cleaning it. Therefore, if pollution results from poor management of HCW then the HCF is responsible. However, if the pollution is due to poor standards at the treatment facility then the HCF jointly with the treatment facility is likely to be held accountable for the pollution. Likewise, this could happen with the service provider. The fact that 11 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 the polluters should pay for the costs they impose on the environment is seen as an efficient incentive to produce less and segregate well. 4.2 NATIONAL ACTS, RULES AND REGULATIONS Nepal has endorsed policies, acts, rules and regulations related to HCWM, that hold health care facilities accountable to their responsibilities regarding the management of health care waste. The relevant documents are outlined in the following. 4.2.1 National Health Policy 2076 (2019) The policy that aims to undertake research, monitoring, controlling, and eliminating communicable diseases, vows to establish a National Disease Control Centre. The policy plans to initiate integrated efforts by bringing all levels together to control infectious diseases and undertake crisis management in the event of a health emergency. The policy states integrated preparedness and response measures shall be adopted to combat communicable diseases, insect-borne and animal-borne diseases, problems related to climate change, other diseases, epidemic, and disasters. Likewise, it further focuses on the following strategies: o Environment and health-friendly technologies shall be encouraged; state and local levels shall be made responsible for proper management, regulation, and continuous monitoring of waste and medical garbage produced by hospitals, health institutions, and laboratories. o Coordination and advocacy shall be done to promote domestic and community waste management and environmental cleanliness. 4.2.2 The environmental protection act 2076(2019) and environmental protection regulation 2077 (2020) Nepal new Environmental Protection Act 2019 prohibits carrying out of any project proposal without getting the environmental studies approved the concerned. All project proposals will have to conduct environmental studies, but the capacity, output or investment of the proposed project determine whether a project requires Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), Initial Environment Examination (IEE), or Concise Environmental Studies (CEA). As part of the efforts to promote stakeholder engagement and information disclosure, the new act makes it mandatory to undertake public hearings at the project site. Moreover, it has a provision to establish an Environmental Protection Fund. The act also allows the government to declare a specific area where harmful materials o r waste is stored or disposed of as a 'polluted' area and restrict it to the general public. The Environment Protection regulation, 2020 asks to prepare an IEE for construction of a new hospital of 25-100 beds with teaching facilities and an IEA for a new hospital construction of over 100 beds with teaching facilities. 4.2.3 Fifteenth Periodic Plan 2019/20 to 2023/24 Fifteen periodic r plan has carried the vision of clean, health and greenery environment. This can be achieved by setting goal of pollution control, waste management and plantation of tree to ensure the right to clean and healthy environment. Management of all kind of waste generating from health facility including household, industry has remained under the prime objective of this plan. 12 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 4.2.4 Minimum Service Standards for different level of HCF in Nepal 2076 (2019) In 2076/2019, the Nepali government created five documents outlining the minimum service standards for different levels of healthcare facilities, specifically primary hospitals with general services, primary hospitals with specialized services, secondary hospitals, tertiary hospitals, and health posts. These standards c over a range of issues for health care facilities; \"hospital waste management\" is clearly address ed in the section \"Hospital Support Services,\" with a checklist for evaluating a hospital's waste management system, including a scoring system for the segrega tion, collection and transportation, treatment and disposal of waste for the different levels of healthcare facilities. 4.2.5 Public Health Service Act 2075(2018) Public Health Act 2018 address es the issues of health care waste management in section 41: For the minimization of the potential health hazards in humans due to environment pollution and waste management, Nepal government can make required standards according to the relevant federal legislations. Nepal government will develop essential standards for the effective collection, reuse, treatment, disposal and enforcement of the health care waste. Provincial and Local government are responsible to follow the above sub section 1 and 2. Every health care facility is responsible for proper segregation of waste into risk and non-risk and proper disposal of the health care waste generated. 4.2.5.1 Public Health Service Regulation 2077 (2020) Government of Nepal has endorsed the Public Health Service Rules 2077 (2020) using the legislative authority provisioned by article 63 of Public Health Service Act 2075 (2018). Section 3 of the rules has provision of different level of health facilities (annex 7) including types and standards of the services. According to the Rule 11, Ministry is responsible to set the standards for different operational services as listed in annex 8, that includes, environment, infection and prevention control, health care waste management and water and sanitation in the healt h facility. Rule 12 says, every health facility needs to be complied the standers for its new license and to renew too. Monitoring and evaluation will be done by public-health inspector, and if the standards are not met, the inspector will either make the health facility to comply the standards or recommend for the associated authority for actions. Similarly Rule 13 Sub rule -3 Renewal of licence to operate Health facility only after complying standards mentioned in annex-8 and Rule number 25: Water Supply , Sanitation and Wate Management, all health facilities have to comply the standards of water supply, sanitation and waste management as mentioned in annex-8: Health Facility Operation Standards - 11.) Healthcare and other waste management standards. 4.2.6 The labour act 2073 (2017) The Labour Act 2017, administered by the Ministry of Labour is the main regulation governing the working environment by making provision for the rights, interests, safety and insurance of workers and employees working in various enterprises. Section 80 is related to the management of infectious disease transmission in working environment and section 68 states the need of Health and safety regulation and working unit within the working place 4.2.7 Local Government Operation Act (2074 (2016) The local government operation Act 2074 has clearly defined the roles and responsibilities of all level of government in terms of health care waste management from local level to federal level. 13 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 As specified in section 41 the federal government will be responsible to formulate essential rules and regulations to prevent the potential health impacts on public health and environment through environmental pollution and waste management. Similarly, with regards to local level following responsibilities have been listed: Every municipality should have an operational landfill site for the management of the waste generated in the municipality. Every rural and urban municipality is responsible for development of operational rules and regulation for providing basic health, sanitation and nutrition in local level. Responsible for supply and monitoring of clean water, air and noise pollution level. Increasing awareness on sanitation and proper management of health care waste Responsible for collection, reuse, treatment and final disposal of health care waste and setting fees for the management. 4.2.8 The industrial enterprises act 2073 (2016) The industrial enterprises act 2016 highlights the need to conduct Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) before establishment. This Act also states that the responsibility of the safe management of the waste lays with the entity that generates the waste . Furthermore, the act has empowered the concern ed authority to punish those who do not comply with the conditions outlined in the license or registration section. The act gives priority and the provision of some benefits to those that use pollution control devices, or enterprises which process the waste into resources (i.e. recycling, upcycling). 4.2.9 Guideline for health institutions establishment, operation and upgrade standard 2071(2014) This guideline contains the code of conducts required for the operation of health institutions. This guideline deals with the infrastructure and standards required for the operation of health institutions like emergency services, outpatient department and in-patient services, pharmacy, emergency preparedness, waste disposal and management and all other prerequisites. 4.2.10 Solid waste management Act 2068(2011) with edited version of 2074 Kartik (2017) Solid Waste Management Act 2068 (2011) with edited version of 2074 Kartik, provides legal basis and regulation for HCWM. Chapter 2 section 3 sub-section 1, 2 and 3 stat es the responsibility of the management of the solid waste will be lies to local government. Whereas chapter 2 section 4 sub- section 1, 2 and 3 states the accountability of the management of the solid waste will be lies to local government. as given below: 1. The accountability to manage or cause to manage solid waste shall rest with the local government. 2. Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section 1, the responsibility for processing and management of hazardous waste, medical waste, chemical waste or industrial waste under the prescribed standards shall rest with the person or institution that has generated the solid waste. 3. If any industry or medical institution requests for the management of solid waste remained after processing of hazardous waste, medical waste, chemical waste and industrial waste or other solid waste, or for using a sanitary landfill site constructed by the local 14 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 government, the local government may manage the solid waste or allow the institution to use the sanitary landfill site by levying fees as determined by the local government. Similarly in sub-section 5, 6,7,8 ,9 and 10 mentioned about reduction in the production of waste, waste segregation at source, extraction of waste (time, place and methodology), designated waste collection centre, transportation of waste and Reduction, Reuse and Recycle (3R) of waste respectively. Involvement of private sector and community in waste management is also provisioned in chapter- 4 which is a vital step in promotion of public private partnership. In the chapter-9 section 38 and 39, it is clearly stated about offence and punishment. According to section 39, sub-section 8: A fine from 50,000 to 100,000 rupees will be charged by local government on anyone who commits offence as mentioned below: a. If throwing, keeping, discharging or causing to discharge chemical waste, industrial waste, healthcare waste or hazardous waste haphazardly; b. If throwing, keeping, discharging or causing to discharge hazardous waste produced by any industrial enterprise or health institution haphazardly; c. If not committing the responsibility while importing chemical pesticide or disposing the expired drugs according to the defined standards as mentioned in section - 44 And if the same offence is committed again, it may also punish with a double fine as was imposed earlier and recommend to the concerned authority for cancellation of the license. Similarly, if the waste is not segregated at source and mixed or thrown in against section 6, local government will punish the person or institution Rs 500 in each time. In Chpter-10 section 43, healthcare waste management is mentioned explicitly. In sub-section 1, it is provision that the before providing permission to establish and operate health institution, concerned authorized body should assured that there is proper management of healthcare waste in place or not and give permission only in case of proper healthcare waste management in place. It is also mentioned in Subsection 2, that the conditions and standards for proper healthcare waste management can be fixed for health institutions while providing such kind of permission. 4.2.11 Drugs Act 2035(1978) : Pursuant to Section 12, this Act mandates the return of drugs that are not safe for public consumption (including by virtue of expiration date), that are not efficacious, or that do not meet quality standards. It is the manufacturer or an agent of the manufacturer that must take back such pharmaceuticals from the seller or distributor. (DDA 1978) 5. HEALTH CARE WASTE MANAGEMENT PLANNING Every HCF must develop its own and individualized HCWM Plan. Ideally, a HCWM plan should be planned and implemented from the initial planning stage of a HCF. In accordance with the legislative requirements, each HCF is responsible for the development of a waste management plan suited for their HCF. Normally, in community health facilities like health-posts and primary health centres it is recommended that HCWM plan can be included in the improvement plan of Water and Sanitation for health facility improvement tool WASHFIT ( (WHO/UNICEF, WASHFIT 2017) . 15 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 This plan must outline the accountabilities and responsibilities of managers, employees and staff. The HCF shall comply with guidelines, ensure proper HCWM through good practice regarding classification, segregation, collection, transportation, treatment and disposal. Options for the HCWM plan depend on the local context and locally available technology and maintenance are an important consideration while making a HCWM plan. HCF can manage HCW themselves or can contract a private organization for the proper management of HCW. Generally, a concrete implementation plan needs to be drafted, a decision for a treatment concept needs to be made and a process of monitoring and evaluation needs to be set in place to ensure a safe and sustainable HCWM system. 5.1 ROLE OF THE DIFFERENT LEVEL OF GOVERNMENTS Efficient and appropriate HCWM practices depend on clear objectives and concrete planning at federal, provincial and local level. Each federal, provincial and local level requires political commitment and a functional committee, within their administrative structure, to oversee the HCWM issue. Appropriate government authority needs to be assigned with the responsibility for proper coordination among the stakeholders. Adequate legislative and financial support along with the active participation by trained, skilled and dedicated staff is necessary. Possible functions of the federal, provincial and local level are provided below. 5.1.1 Federal Possible functions and responsibilities to be taken on by the federal level are listed below. Form a steering committee including members from all relevant ministries and organizations. The steering committee may consist of members from the following institutions, with additional members chosen by the federal government to suit the needs and scope of the committee. Chief Specialist -Ministry of Health and Population (Chair) Director General - Department of Health Service (Co-Chair) Director Management Division Representative - Ministry of Health and Population Representatives from Curative Division, Department of Health Services (DoHS) Representatives from Nursing and Social Security Division, DoHS Representatives from Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, DoHS Representatives from Family Welfare Division, DoHS Representatives from National Public Health Lab.

From a Technical Working Group to support and co-ordinate ongoing programme on HCWM including regular capacity building activities on compliance of rules and regulations at federal level 5.1.2 Provincial The possible functions and responsibilities of the provincial governments are in part very similar to those of the federal level, adjusted to the jurisdiction of the provincial level, with some additional tasks, as listed below. A steering committee can be under the leadership of Ministry of Social Development as per their need and scope. Assign well-defined roles and responsibilities to the members and organizations of the formed steering committee Advocate and facilitate to form a HCWM committee in the health facilities within their jurisdiction and clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the members of the committee. Form a Technical Working Group to support and co-ordinate ongoing activities at federal level including regular capacity building activities on compliance of rules and regulations at provincial level Facilitate the coordination among municipalities within the province. Play a liaison role between federal and local government. Facilitate formation of provincial level health care waste management policy, strategic plan, directories, guidance, and other necessary documents as required with compliance with the national standards. 17 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Establish a monitoring mechanism and capacity development measures to ensure safe health care waste management practices within the province. Allocate sufficient budget and human resources for the improvement of health care waste management practices within the province. 5.1.3 Local level Possible functions and responsibilities to be taken on by the local level government are listed below. Develop municipal level health care waste management committee. The committee may consist of the members nominated by the local government as per their needs. Facilitate to form a HCWM committee in all the health facilities within their jurisdiction and define the roles and responsibilities of the members of the committee. Support health care facilities within their jurisdiction to develop and implement improvement plan based on risk using tools like Water and Sanitation in Health Care Facility Improvement Tool (WASHFIT) in coordination with provincial government / supportin g agency Incorporate healthcare waste management in municipal policy and strategic plan Conduct healthcare waste assessment study to understand situation of municipality and establish HCWM information system Develop municipal integrated healthcare waste management strategic plan and allocate a substantial budget. Formulate monitoring and evaluation mechanism including regular capacity building activities on compliance of rules and regulations at HF level as well as local level. Collection of waste from different health facility and treat them. 5.1.4 Facility Level The entire organizational structure and service of HCF must be held responsible for the proper management of HCW. However, particular units within the HCF must be identified to play a major role in setting up and maintaining a HCWM system. The functions of the administrations are provided in the paragraph below. Form a HCWM committee in the health facility with the support of federal, provincial and local government. Depending on the size of the HCF, and tailored to the individual needs and scope of the HCF regarding additional members, potential members of the committee at facility level could consist of: o Larger Facilities (Hospitals) Chair of the Health Facility Operation and Management Committee (HFOMC) Chief or Director of the HCF (Chair) Department Heads 18 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Nursing chief Waste Management Officer / Trained Focal Person Head House Keeping Representative from cleaning staff o Smaller Facilities ( Health Post, clinics and others) Chair/ Representative from HFOMC Chief of the HCF Technical staff / Trained focal person Support staff (cleaners and workers) Establish HCWM information system with baseline data and develop the HCWM plan . This plan must include training and written guidelines on the whole waste management system, from waste generation over waste treatment to final disposal. Implement the HCWM plan and review and update the plans and guidelines on an annual basis. Ensure compliance of HCWM related rules and regulations and integrated with Municipal Waste management system only after proper treatment of infectious waste with recommended technology. Ensure adequate financial and human resources for the implementation of HCWM plan (to support this, the authori zed body can recommend the formulation of strategy to allocate substantial amount of budget for HCWM. 5.2 STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF MODEL HCWM SYSTEM A comprehensive plan on how to implement a HCWM system at facility level is essential for the safe, sustainable and efficient waste management in HCFs. Figure 12 shows all the necessary steps for the implementation of a HCWM system as a flowchart. 5.2.1 Health Care Waste Management Committee Formation A health care waste management committee should be established in every health care facility. A focal person responsible for all the health care waste management issues should be appointed and trained properly. All level of health care facilities can form the committee as recommended in section 7.1.4 5.2.2 Waste Assessment While developing the waste management plan, the first step is a diagnostic assessment of the waste generation within the facility. The assessment begins by establishing a baseline of how much and what kind of waste is being generated by each department or ward. This involves gathering data regarding the waste streams, processes and operations, types of practices, information on input materials and economic information Data collected for few days provides a snapshot of the waste flow in the HCF. Assessing the waste over a period of seven continuous days provides a clear er picture of waste generation, as the waste generation pattern differs from day to day. Through this data the HCF can establish the flow of waste and generation rates from every unit and department of the HCF. Waste composition data can be used to analyse segregation practice. Data from the waste generation survey should form the basis for the HCWM information system and the development of a HCWM plan as well as strategic plan at local, provincial and federal level. A draft of the assessment data collection format is provided in Annex I 19 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 After the intervention of waste management plan, waste audit is utmost to evaluate the results. A waste audit is an important tool for the assessment phase, as it provides data on the source of waste, the composition of the generated waste, the amount of waste as well as the waste flow within the HCF. Data can be collected in-house using self- audit forms and questionnaires. 5.2.3 Planning In the process of developing a HCWM plan, the following procedures should be taken into consideration. Existing policies, laws, regulations and guidelines related to HCWM need to be considered and followed. The current waste management stream within the HCF needs to be reviewed and assessed before drafting or revising a new HCWM plan. Special attention should be placed on the following aspects: o Where is the waste treatment/ storage area, and how is going to be designed? o How and where the waste is collected, stored and transported? o What technology is going to be used for treatment of infectious waste and whether it is sustainable and environment friendly or not? o How the waste is treated and disposed? o The cost effectiveness of the current handling process o Personal safety of the waste handlers o Infrastructure of health facility o Number of beds/services/facilities o Types and amount of waste generation o Principles adopted for waste management such as 3R. The existing and future needs of the HCF need to be taken into consideration during the design planning phase. The plan must be capable of handling the current waste stream properly and efficiently, and additionally be equipped to be able to cope with a temporary, extraordinarily high waste generation rate (e.g. after natural disasters or during pandemics) . Also the plan should include the plan for capacity building of staff including onsite coaching and refresher trainings and orientations. Likewise, the plan should be regularly reviewed and updated based on the recommendations of the implementation, monitoring and evaluation teams. 5.2.4 Treatment Centre Designing and Construction Once the treatment technology is finalized, a detailed design of the waste treatment and processing centre with proper waste flow is prepared and constructed. The area should be enough for the treatment of the waste generated in the facility. Separate entry point/door for infectious and general waste should be provided and site selection should be at the appropriate location recommended by experts. The treatment area must be different from patient management areas. Dedicated power circuit must be available Treatment centre should be a completely closed building with controlled ventilation and if needed air filtration system. Treatment centre should have proper electrical and water supply facilities. Drainage system should be provided at appropriate locations inside the facility that could drain 20 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 surface cleaning wastewater. Likewise, designated areas for storage of waste during emergency should be allocated during the design. Space for storage of different types of waste such as metal, needle, bottle, plastic, biodegradable pit, cytotoxic etc 5.2.5 Transportation Route Planning The transport route to the HCW Collection site needs to be identified and tested. The transportation route should be such that, there is minimum flow of visitors and patients and also the waste volume is not overfilled in the trolleys during transportation. Separate routes or ramp may be needed to be designed in facilities which does not have a separate route/ elevator for waste transportation. The time for infectious and non-infectious waste transport must be different. 5.2.6 Testing of treatment technology Environment friendly sustainable waste treatment technology should be selected which is most feasible in local context. Non-burning technology are highly recommended. All treatment technologies should be pretested to ensure its efficiency of treatment of pathogens and other hazards before its operation. The treatment processes should be validated and periodically tested to ensure they function properly using biological indicators (e.g.: spores) or other test assays. The technology/equipment or machine must have PPM and backup plan too. 5.2.7 Capacity building and sensitization Sensitization, motivation towards waste management, behaviour change and positive attitude are foundation for effective waste management along with capacity building. Capacity building is an important aspect prior to and during the operation of the health care waste management system. Dedication from all staffs from director to cleaner is paramount for success. The trainings should ensure that staf fs at all levels of health care facilities are aware of the health care waste manag ement plan, their own responsibilities and obligations in this regard. Integrated training package of HCWM, Environmental Health and WASH is highly recommended. 5.2.8 Initiation of the System Finally, once every aspects of operation is completed. Wards and other units should be provided with proper segregation bins and needle cutters along with segregation trollies information leaflet, board etc to initiate the system in the health care facilities. During initiation of the system, it is always suggested to initiate with one unit and then further replicate periodically reviewing the system. 5.2.9 Supportive supervision and continuous monitoring The detailed step by step plan is demonstrated in the flow chart below (Fig1) : 21 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Once the treatment technology is finalized, a detailed design of the waste treatment an d processing centre with proper waste flow is prepared and constructed. A draft design is provided in section 6.2.3. The steps to form the committee and required member are listed in 5.1.4 The system needs to be initiated in a participatory approach, involving every staff member of the particular unit when decision regarding the system, such as location of the bins, needle destroyers, storage point, collection time etc. are determined . It is recommended to start with a few selected units as model units. After successful implementation the system can be gradually replicated in other units. Monitoring regularly ensures the effective operation of the system. The waste management system should be monitored daily in all the units by the facility staffs. Additional external monitoring needs to be conducted according to the legal framework. Health Care Waste Management Committee Formation Health Care Waste Management Assessment Detailed assessment needs to be conducted to identify the waste generation, patterns and gaps for improvement. Health Care Waste Management Planning Detailed planning should consist of required logistics, treatment technology, capital and operating cost, training plan and others Health Care Waste Management Treatment Centre Designing and Construction Testing of treatment technology Prior to operation of any treatment technologies, they need to be tested and validated for operation. Test are usually conducted to validate the minimum temperature, pressure, exposure time and others to achieve the microbial inactivation standard. Transportation Route Planning Organized transportation route within the HCF aids to prevent exposure to staff, patients and other hazards. Less crowded options should be preferred. It is advisable to conduct trials of transportation in the route before implementation. Capacity Building All staff of the health care facilities, ranging from support staff to the managerial level should be trained. Trainings should be provided tailored to the staff level and their understanding. Initiation of the system Monitoring supportive supervision and onsite coaching of the system Figure 1: Flowchart of steps of Health care waste management system implementation a t facility level 22 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 6. 6KEY STEPS TO IMPLEMENT HCWM SYSTEM The basic steps listed below are considered essential for the proper practice of a health care wast e management system and will be elaborated in the following section: 1. Waste minimization 2. Waste segregation at source 3. Waste collection and storage 4. Waste transportation 5. Waste treatment and disposal 6. Monitoring and Evaluation 6.1 WASTE MINIMIZATION Waste minimization is defined as both the prevention as well as the reduction of waste production. Waste minimization usually benefits the waste producer by reducing the costs for the purchase of goods. It involves specific strategies of changes in management and behaviour. One of the best waste minimization approaches is the adoption of a waste avoidance strategy. To achieve this, work practices need to be changed. The amount of waste generated is often dictated by processes and behaviours at the workplace. Sustainable behaviours such as choosing reusable equipment over single use, sending e-mails instead of using letters or paper memos, using reusable cups over disposable ones etc. can lead to a minimization of waste. Thus, methods of waste reduction include modification of purchasing procedures, control of inventory and use of less toxic materials. However, no actions should be taken that would impact the quality and limit the access to health care. Waste minimization can be achieved through the reduction of waste generation at source (product substitution, product change, procedural change) and by giving preference to recyclable and reusable items. During infectious pandemic situation (e.g COVID-19) un-necessary visiting isolation area and unnecessary use of PPE generated lots of extra waste, that could be optimized. 6.2 SEGREGATION , STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION OF HEALTH CARE WASTE 6.2.1 Waste Segregation at source Waste segregation refers to the process of separation of waste at the point of generation and keeping them apart during handling, collection, interim storage and transportation. Segregation of the waste at source is the most important step for a successful management of HCW. The reason for this is that the amount of potentially hazardous waste is kept at a minimum as contamination of general waste is avoided. It is highly recommended that segregation of HCW occurs on-site at the time the waste is generated, e.g. when an injection is given, needle and syringe are deposited in their respective, different waste containe rs. Infectious waste must never be mixed with non-infectious waste to keep the volume of infectious waste as low as possible. Segregating risk wastes from non- risk waste additionally greatly reduces the risks of infecting staff and workers handling HCWs. A recommended way of identifying HCW categories is by sorting the waste into color-coded and well- labelled bags or containers. Segregation should: Always take place at the point of waste generation 23 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Be simple and uniform throughout the facility Be well understood and well known by the medical and ancillary staff of the HCFs Be regularly monitored to ensure strict adherence to the procedures 6.2.2 Colour code for segregation The suggested colours for the containers for the different categories of waste are shown in figure below. Signs and Symbols for waste segregation: Sign and symbols are necessary to achieve effective segregation. Labels including the symbols for different waste must be used. Likewise, health care facilities are recommended to use labels and stickers with pictures to assist all the visitors for proper segregation of the waste generated. The recommended color-coding for the containers for different categories of waste as well as the international symbols for risk waste categories are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Recommended color-codes for the container, labelling and international signs for segregation of HCW Waste Category, symbol and label Colour of Container Non-risk HCW Biodegradable Green Non-biodegradable Blue Risk HCW Pathological waste Danger! Pathological waste Red Sharps Waste Danger! Contaminated sharps Red Health care waste General 24 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Infectious Waste Red Pharmaceuticals waste Red Cytotoxic Waste Red Chemical Waste Danger! To be discarded by authorized staff only Yellow Radioactive Waste Danger! Radioactive Waste Black The necessary containers for the segregation of waste depend on the types of the waste generated at the HCF, the available technology for the treatment and disposal, and the local environmental conditions of the HCF. HCFs should categorize and segregate the HCWs as mentioned above. A modified medication trolley with extra containers for the separation of waste at source should be used in hospital. Risk and general waste are distinctly separated on opposing sides of the trolley, i.e. risk waste on the left, general waste on the right. This is to avoid mixing and confusion during segregation. 6.2.3 Waste Collection Some larger units in a facility may consists of dirty utility room or interim storage, where the wastes are stored properly after every shift or when required before the waste are transported to the final waste treatment area. If utility rooms are not available, at least the infectious waste can be stored at another designated location near to a med ical area but away from patients and public areas. These waste needs to be collected and transported away in daily basis. Proper colour coded bins should be used for waste collecti on. 6.2.4 Waste Transportation Health care waste collection and transportation practices should be designed to achieve an e fficient movement of waste from point of generation to storage or treatment. A program for collection of HCW should be established as part of the HCWM plan. Certain recommendations should be followed by the auxiliary worker in-charge of waste collection: 25 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Suggested frequency of collection on room to room basis is once every duty shift. T ime of collection regardless of category should be at the start of every shift. In case of difficulty in the collection of waste in every shift, waste should be collected on daily basis (or as frequently as required) and transported to the designated central storage site of HCF. No bags should be removed unless they are labelled with their point of production (hospital and ward or department) and contents. The bags or containers should be replaced immediately with new ones of the same type. A supply of fresh collection bags or containers should be readily available at all locations where waste is produced. 6.2.4.1 On-site transport The waste disposal plan of HCF should include procedures for on-site and off-site transport of wastes. During movement of waste segregation must be maintained and the batch of waste should be managed according to the component with the highest level of risks. On- site transport of waste from the point of generation to an assembly storage or treatment area should be carried out by wheeled trolleys, containers or carts without spoil. Wherever possible, the transport of waste should be separate from route with maximum flow of patients and visitors. Hazardous and infectious HCW and non- risk HCW should be transported on separate trolleys. The transportation must follow specific routes through the HCF to reduce the passage of loaded carts through wards and other clean areas. The trolleys or vehicles should be: Easy to load and unload. Have no sharp edges that could potentially damage waste bags or containers during the loading and unloading. Easy to clean. Well functional and having wheel Simplified Transportation Trolley Health care waste needs to be transported in trollies for safe handling. The trollies used for health care waste transportation should not be used for any other purposes. Generally, two types of trollies are used in health care setting, one for transporting waste within a unit, e.g. a modified medication trolley with extra containers for the separation of waste at source. Another is the waste transportation trolley is for the transportation from the source to the collection point, i.e. from the different units to the treatment site. Wheeled containers, trolleys (e.g. modified medication trollies) or carts used for transferring health- care waste within health- care facilities should be designed and constructed so that: 1. Separate bins for all the different types of waste that need to be separated are available. 2. Risk and general waste are distinctly separated on opposing sides of the trolley, i.e. risk waste on the left, general waste on the right. 3. Edges on the trolley are dull and blunt. Sharp edges must be avoided to not run the risk of waste bags tearing open during loading and unloading. 4. An edge or similar is available to contain any leakage from damaged waste bags. 5. The surface and material of the trolley can easily be cleaned, disinfected and drained. 6. The waste may be easily loaded, secured and unloaded. 26 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 For the transportation from source to collection point, there should be separate trollies for the transportation of risk and general waste with separate transportation routes. Therefore, for the second trolley type the separation on opposing sides of the trolley is not necessary as there is no general waste on the risk waste trolley and vice versa. Trolleys must be cleaned and disinfected daily using chlorine solution and phenolic compounds. 6.2.4.2 Responsibility of in-site waste transportation: Responsibility of in-site waste transportation will be of concerned heath institution. Responsibility of segregated waste transportation from source to collection point or temporary storage point and up to treatment house, lies to designated waste worker appointed by hospital. The people transporting the waste should be equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment including full sleeved Apron, Mask, Caps, Eye protector, face shield (if necessary), gloves and boots 6.2.4.3 Off-site transport The HCW producer is responsible for the safe packaging and appropriate labelling of the waste to be transported off-site as well as for the authorization of its destination i.e. the CTF and need to be safely disposed at landfill site after proper treatment. Vehicles used for transporting clinical and related waste should be exclusively reserved for this purpose wherever possible. Vehicles must be easy to load, unload, clean and can be closed properly with proper spill management facility. Furthermore, they should be equipped with spillage collection sumps or other suitable spill controls. The vehicle should be marked with the name and address of the waste carrier. The hazardous and infectious symbols should be prominently displayed on the vehicle. A fundamental requirement is for the vehicle transporting hazardous waste to be roadworthy and labelled to indicate its load, and its payload to be secured to minimize the risk of accidents and spillages. Any vehicle used to transport health-care waste should fulfil several design criteria: The body of the vehicle should be of a suitable size commensurate with the design of the vehicle. There should be a bulkhead between the driver's cabin and the vehicle body, which is designed to retain the load if the vehicle is involved in a collision. There should be a suitable system for securing the load during transport. Empty plastic bags, suitable protective clothing, cleaning equipment, tools and disinfectant, together with special kits for dealing with liquid spills, should be carried in a separate compartment in the vehicle. The internal finish of the vehicle should allow it to be steam-cleaned and internal angles should be rounded to eliminate sharp edges to permit more thorough cleaning and prevent damage to waste containers. The vehicle should be marked with the name and address of the waste carrier. An international hazard sign should be displayed on the vehicle and containers, as well as an emergency telephone number. The driver should be provided with details of the waste being carried (WHO 2014). 6.2.4.4 Responsibility of off-site waste transportation: According to Solid Waste Management Act 2068 (2011) with edited version of 2074 Kartik, Chapter 2 section 9 sub-section 1, 2 and 3 states the responsibility of transportation of the solid waste from collection point to transformation centre and up to waste management place will be lies to local 27 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 government or of the organization or body assigned by local government. Off-site transportation of properly treated healthcare waste can be managed in coordination with concerned local government. 6.2.5 Spill Management HCFs are responsible for clinical and related waste spills that may accidently occur at on-site and CTF management committee or private company contracted for HCWM transportation are responsible for off-site spill management. HCF in care of onsite and CTF management committee in case of off-site, must include a spill management plan with well-defined procedures for handling spills safely in its HCWM plan. Personnel responsible for spill management must receive education and training in emergency procedures and handling requirements. They must be fully aware of all procedures, i.e. how, when and which emergency service should be called for advice and assistance. Spill kits should be made easily accessible and should contain absorbents, disinfectants, buckets, shovel, broom, gloves, disposable overalls, facemasks or shields, torch, disposable containers and plastic waste bags with appropriate labelling. 6.2.6 Waste Storage In order to avoid accumulation of waste, it must be collected and transported to a central storage area within the HCF on a regular basis before being treated or removed. For infectious waste the maximum storage time before treatment or disposal is no longer than 48 hours during the cooler season and no more than 24 hours during the hot season. Storage facilities should be inside the health care facility premises. These areas should be sized according to the quantity of the waste generated, the waste collection and transportation frequency and lastly according to available recycling and disposal options. These areas should store only the specified waste types, this means waste types should not be mixed, i.e. infectious waste should not be stored along with the pharmaceutical waste. Each waste type needs to be stored separately and labelled properly To ensure a proper control of the waste management system, records of the stored wastes, the undergone treatment and the respective disposal dates need to be kept. All the collected HCW should be stored in waste storage area until transported to a designated treatment facility. This area must be marked with warning sign. Storage facilities for waste should be suitably established within the HCF, however, these areas are to be located away from patient rooms, laboratories, hospital function and operation rooms or any area with public access. The storage facility should be lockable, hygienic and appropriately sign-posted. They must be kept secured at all the times. HCFs are responsible for providing: Designated storage areas with adequate lighting, cross ventilation as well as protection from sun, rain, strong winds and floods. Location and site selection as per experts' recommendation. Design of storage area that enables the storage of segregated waste as per the type of waste Storage areas designed in such a way that routine cleaning and maintenance to hygienic standards and post- spill decontamination are easy to undertake. Water supply for cleaning purposes. Supply of cleaning equipment, protective clothing and waste bags or containers located close to the storage area 28 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Spill kits for the containment of spills within the storage area Waste security and restriction of access to authorized persons. Easy access for waste collection vehicles. 6.3 TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL METHODS HCFs can chose whether they want to follow an on-site treatment or an off-site treatment approach. Independently of whether the HCFs chose off-site treatment, in a central treatment facilit y (CTF), or on-site treatment, on the hospital premises, ultimately the HCFs are responsible for the proper treatment and disposal of their HCW. The HCWM plan and system for each HCF must be tailored to the chosen approach. The two approaches are outlined in the following 6.3.1 On-Site Treatment According to the SWM Act 2011, any institution which generates hazardous or medical wastes ar e themselves responsible for the management of respective wastes. Thus, HCFs are responsible to capacitate themselves for the management of wastes and require the treatment of infectious wastes before transporting out of the facility. The practice of mixing untreated infectious wastes with municipal wastes might generate high chance of cross-infection to the waste handlers and those who are exposed to such type of wastes. In this modality health care facility, they operate a waste treatment centre, where all the hazardous waste generated within a health care facility is treated and rendered safe before final disposal. Section 7.2 highlights the detailed steps for development of on- site treatment facility within a facility premises. 6.3.2 Off-Site Treatment Health care institutions ranging from small clinics to larger health facilities are dispersed throughout the cities. A majority of the health care facilities in the urban context might not have the required space for setting up a treatment facility for the waste generated within their facility. In such scenarios, central treatment facilities are a good option for better management of the health care waste generated. CTF operated by either the public body of private sectors, serve as a common treatment area for all the health care waste generated throughout the city. The cost of treatment and disposal are mainly determined by the type of the treatment technology used and volume of waste in the CTF. Some of the issues that needs to be considered for operation of CTF are listed below: As specified by Government of Nepal in Environment Regulation 2020, all hazardous waste treatment site need to conduct EIA prior to operation, before establishing any hazardous waste treatment site. Prior to setup and operation of the plant, an environmental impact assessment of the site needs to be completed and approved by the concerned authorities. CTF operated within a municipality needs to be owned by the local body. In some instances, a CTF might be bringing waste from different municipalities, in such cases, a municipality where the facility is installed may take the ownership. The ownership can be transferred to private sectors with agreement with the municipality. CTF can be operated in a public private partnership model or by the municipality itself. CTF should never be installed or operated within a health facility premises. Collection of potentially hazardous waste inside health care facilities should be strictly prohibited. 29 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 CTF as a service provider may charge health-care facilities on a per-volume, per-weight or per-bed basis. 6.4 SELECTION OF TREATMENT METHODS The methods for treatment and disposal of HCWs depend on specific factors applicable to the HCF, relevant legislation and environmental aspects affecting the public. The bulk of HCW falls into the category of general waste, much of which can be recycled or reused. With correct segregation, low amounts of waste are categorized as hazardous waste requiring specific attention. Hazardous waste must be treated with approved treatment methods. Once treated, the waste may be re-classified for disposal. Currently available waste treatment options have various capabilities and limitations. As technology changes, HCFs should evaluate treatment alternatives regarding their safety, effectiveness, environmental impacts, costs and compliance with the country requirements. Any treatment option for HCW should: Render sharps incapable of causing penetration injury. Achieve a significant volume reduction with no hazardous by-products. Result in residues being suitable for approved landfill disposal without harmful leaching to the environment. Result in minimum levels of hazardous or toxic by-products including POPs such as polychlorobiphenyls. Reduce the potential for transmission of infection. Be verifiable for the treated wastes. Have automatic controls and built-in safe mechanism. Provide continuous automatic monitoring and recording. Ensure that waste cannot bypass the treatment process. Meet occupational health and safety standards. Have a safe alternative treatment and disposal in case of emergency. Be tested and maintained as defined by the manufacturer's technical datasheet, to ensure optimal performance. In case of autoclave, tests need to be first validated and regular testing needs to be performed at least annually. The below listed techniques are currently available for the treatment and disposal of HCW and will be further elaborated in this section: a. Biological Procedures b. Autoclave c.

Emerging technologies During selection of treatment technologies these environmental and operational aspects should always be considered. Annex II I provides the table with comparison of types of technologies available which comply with the Stockholm and Basel Conventions. Similarly table in Annex IV compares interim treatment technologies which do not meet the two conventions requirement and are considered as interim solutions. These tables rate available technologies based on their environmental impacts, capital cost and operating costs (WHO, Overview of technologies for the treatment of infectious and sharp waste from health care facilities 2019) . ( =low, = medium, = high and = very high) Likewise this treatment technologies ladder aid in providing a clear picture of the acceptable technologies in all scenarios (WHO, Overview of technologies for the treatment of infectious and sharp waste from health care facilities 2019). 6.4.1 Biological Procedures Biological procedures require a controlled regulation of temperature, pH and enzyme levels and other variables. Presently, biological procedures are gaining popularity for the disposal of non- Figure 2: Treatment Technologies Ladders 31 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 hazardous biodegradable HCW. The most common biological procedures are compost ing, vermicomposting and anaerobic digestion. Composting Composting is the recommended technique for non-hazardous and biodegradable HCW. Composting is the natural, biological decomposition of organic matter by fungi, bacteria, insects, worms and other organisms. Successful composting entails the management of the decomposition process so that it is safe and clean. Organisms that decompose organic matter require the following basic inputs and conditions to maximize the process and efficiency: A suitable food source; A suitable temperature; Water; and Oxygen (if decomposing aerobically) Poorly managed composting may produce offensive odours, encourage pests and vermin, spread plant and animal pathogens, cause environmental contamination and generate a product of inferior quality through extended processing times that will be inefficient and inappropriate in a commercial composting operation. Proper compost management therefore is important. Vermicomposting Vermicomposting is the process of degradation of biodegradable matter through worms. The specialized worms used can speed up the digestion process through the vigorous digestion of the materials. The worms also support the process by increasing the aeration and drainage of moisture through the compost. Earthworms of the Eisenia fetida species are popular in Nepal for vermicomposting of solid household biodegradable waste. Placenta Pit Placenta pits are commonly used for the disposal of pathological waste especially the placentas. Around 90% of the waste is liquid which is gradually soaked into the ground and the remaining human tissues are left for biological degradation. The decomposition process is usually anaerobic process, though some aerobic decomposition occurs at the top layers. The waste should not be pretreated with chemicals, which shall delay the decomposition process by killing the pathogens required for the decomposition process in the pit. Source: Health Infrastructure Design and construction Guideline, GoN, 2073) Figure 3 Sample design drawing of placenta pit 32 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Anaerobic digestion During anaerobic digestion biodegradable waste is degraded in absence of oxygen. The process occurs due to anaerobic organisms, which results in production of methane as a by-product. Anaerobic systems operate in different temperature ranges, psychrophilic (5- 15C), mesophilic (25 - 40 C) or thermophilic (55-70 C). The temperature, pressure , retention time and the anaerobic condition aids in destroying pathogens. There are many instances in health care facilities of Nepal, where anaerobic digesters ha ve been used for the treatment and disposal of biodegradable health care waste. Though a very efficient technology, the system needs to be closely monitored and controlled. The outlet should be tested regularly for the presence of any harmful pathogens, before the slurry is disposed in the sewer system. As research has shown that the presence of roundworm eggs (ascaris ova) in the outlet is possible, close monitoring is key (WHO 2014). 6.4.2 Low heat thermal-based treatments Low heat thermal based treatments can make hazardous waste safe by killing all pathogens including spores. Some commonly used technologies are summarized below: Autoclave Autoclave is a process of steam sterilization under pressure. It is a low heat process in which steam is brought into direct contact with the waste material for a sufficient duration to sterilize the material. This technology has been used for a long time in HCFs for sterilization of reusable medical equipment in health facilities of Nepal. Typically, autoclaves are used in hospitals for the sterilization of medical equipment and to render infectious waste harmless. The pressurized steam within the autoclave (270 F, 30 psi) is enough for most contaminants . Radioactive material or any material that may be contaminated by radiation , combustible, flammable or volatile liquids, any liquid in a sealed container, any material contained in such a manner that it touches the interior surfaces of the autoclave should never be placed inside autoclave. Integrated steam-based treatment system The integrated steam-based systems combine internal shredding, steam treatment-mixing and drying in a continuous unit. These technologies are designed for achieving more uniform heating of the waste and rendering the waste unrecognizable. Since most autoclaves and hybrid autoclaves operate in batch processes, these technologies are sometime referred as advanced steam treatment technologies treating waste in continuous process (WHO 2014) Examples of such technologies include: Steam treatment-mixing-fragmenting followed by drying and shredding Internal shredding followed by steam treatment-mixing and then drying Internal shredding-steam treatment-mixing followed by drying Internal shredding followed by steam treatment-mixing-compaction. Microwave Microwave treatment is a steam-based treatment technology where microwave energy generates moist heat and steam by heating the moisture in the waste. Microwave radiation is used for the treatment of the infectious HCW. Radiation with a frequency of about 2450 MHz and a wavelength of 12.24 cm heats the water contained in the waste and produces steam. 33 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Waste similar to the waste treated in autoclaves, such as infectious waste, sharp waste, cultures for laboratories, and othe rs can be treated in microwaves. Pharmaceutical waste, chemical waste and cytotoxic wastes, metals should not be treated in a microwave system. In the context of Nepal, the use of microwaves for the treatment of HCW is a new technology. Integrated microwave systems are popular worldwide, where all waste fed into the system is shredded. This practice overlooks segregation of the waste and minimises the possibilities of recycling the recyclable part of waste. Hence, such integrated systems are not recommended for the treatment of health care waste. Frictional heat treatment System This technology uses both steam as well as dry heat. F rictional heat with temperatures of 135C to 150C are used for several minutes. Highspeed rotating shredders generate heat and the well as moisture in the waste turns into steam. Such technologies can achieve an up to 80% decrease in volume reduction When all fluids have evaporated, the waste inside the chambers is further be heated to dry superheated condition. The system capacity ranges from 10 kg to 500 kg per hour. This process not only shreds the waste into small pieces, it additionally causes damage to the cell membranes, which along with the steam and dry heat, results in the destruction of pathogens. 6.4.3 Chemical treatment There are various methods of chemical treatment of the health care waste. Some of them are listed below: Chemical disinfectants: Chemical disinfections are one of the most popular methods for the treatment of infectious and pathological wastes, especially in rural settings. Chemicals such as aldehydes, chlorine compounds and phenolic compounds are added to HCW to kill or inactivate pathogens. By using these as a treatment methodology, exposure to chemicals such as chlorine disinfectants, glutaraldehyde, various sterilant (such as ethylene oxide) and others result in skin and respiratory sensitization, eye and skin irritation, weakness, exhaustion, dizziness, numbness, drowsiness and nausea. (WHO 2014). Alkaline hydrolysis Some chemical systems use heated alkali solutions to destroy tissues, organ, body parts and other anatomical waste. It is a process that converts animal carcasses, human body parts and tissues into a decontaminated aqueous solution. Steam-jacketed, stainless-steel tanks and a basket are used in this technology. The waste is loaded in the basket and put in the tank, alkali (sodium or potassium hydroxide) is added along with water in proportion to the volume of waste added. This is further heated to a temperature between 110C and 127C an d stirred. Usually, it takes around six to eight hours for complete digestion, depending upon the alkali concentration and temperature. Chemical decomposition: Chemotherapy waste (including bulk cytotoxic agents) can be treated by chemical decomposition. Examples are reactions with 5% sodium hypochlorite; acid hydrolysis followed by alkaline hydrolysis; reduction using zinc powder, degradation using 30% hydrogen peroxide; and destruction using heated alkali. 34 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Micro-organism types, degree of contamination, type of disinfectant, contact time and other relevant factors such as temperature, pH, mixing requirements and the biology of the microorganism should be considered when using chemical treatments. Occupational health and safety should be taken in consideration while using chemical disinfection. Ultimate disposal of chemically treated waste should be in accordance with national and local requirements. 6.4.4 Burial based disposal methods Burial of waste is one of the oldest and popular techniques of waste disposal. There are many ways of burial; some of which are summarized below: Encapsulation and Inertization Encapsulation involves the filling of the containers with waste, adding an immo bilizing material and sealing the container. The process uses either cubic boxes made of high- density polyethylene or metallic drums. When containers are three quarters filled with sharps, pharmaceuticals and chemical waste, an immobilizing agent such as plastic foam, bituminous sand, cement mortar or clay is poured into it. The material dries and the container is sealed and disposed safely in the landfill. Encapsulation is effective in reducing the risk of scavengers gaining access to the hazardous waste. It is particularly suitable for sharps and pharmaceutical waste. Inertization is a suitable disposal method for the pharmaceuticals and incinerated ash es with heavy metal content (WHO 1999). In this technique, HC W is mixed with cement and other substances in a composition of 65% waste, 15% lime, 15% cement and 5% water. The formed mixture is allowed to set into cubes or pellets and then is transported to a suitable storage site. For proper setting of the mixture into cubes and pellets, the waste must be grinded. This technique helps to minimize the risk of contamination of toxic substances through migration to surface water or ground water and prevents scavenging. Sanitary landfill Sanitary landfills are an engineered method, designed and constructed to keep the waste isolated from the environment. There should not be any contamination of the soil, surface, and ground water . Furthermore, it should limit air pollution, smells and direct contact with the public. Some essential features of sanitary landfills are: Easy access to the site and working areas for waste delivery. Personnel should be available on-site for effectively controlling the daily operation. The site should be planned appropriately and divided into manageable phases, before starting the landfill. Lining of the base and sides of the sites must be adequately sealed to minimize the movement of wastewater. Landfill site should be at least 500 meters away from water sources. There must be landfill gas control measures, environmental monitoring points and bore holes (for monitoring air and ground water quality). There must be adequate and efficient mechanisms for leachate collection and treatment. The site must be well organized in a small area, i.e. proper spreading, compaction, and daily covering the waste with soil. The landfill site must be protected with wire bar or fences to prevent from unauthorized access by people and animals. 35 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Final cover must be constructed to prevent and minimize rainwater infiltration after eac h phase of the landfill is completed. Burial pit Hazardous waste can be buried in a special pit. For this purpose, the pit should be 2-5 m deep and 1-2 m wide. The bottom of the pit should be at least 2 m above the water table. After each waste load, it should be covered with a 10 -30 cm thick soil layer. If coverage with soil is not possible, lime may be deposited over the waste. When the level of the waste reaches up to 30 to 50 cm to the surface of the ground, the pit needs to be filled with dirt, seal ed with concrete and a new pit should be dug if necessary. The following rules need to be established for proper HCWM in burial pit: Access to this dedicated disposal area should be restricted to authorized person only. The use of a pit should be supervised by landfill staff to prevent scavenging. Water deposition around the burial pit should be prevented. The burial site should be lined with a material of low permeability, such as clay, to prevent pollution of ground water. Large quantities (higher than 1 kg) of chemical/pharmaceutical wastes should not be buried. The burial site should be managed as a landfill, with each layer of waste covered with a layer of soil to prevent the attraction from rodents and insects as well as limit odours. Burial site should not be located in flood prone areas. The burial site should be fenced with warning signs. The location of waste burial pit should be down-hill or down-gradient from any nearby wells and about 50 meters away from any water body such as rivers or lakes. HCF should keep a record of the size and location of the existing burial pits to prevent construction works. Figure 4: Burial Pit (MoHP 2020) Septic or concrete vault This method can be used for the disposal of used sharps and syringes. In this method a concrete pit of slabs of (1m x 1m x 1.8m depth), enough to accommodate sharps and syringes for certain period without reaching the ground water level is constructed. The site must be isolated and at least 5 m away from the ground water sources and dwelling units 36 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 6.4.5 Emerging Technologies Suitable selection of technology is a very important step for the successful implementation of a health care waste management system. Especially emerging technologies should be carefully reviewed prior to installation and operation. Some of the examples of emerging technologies are plasma pyrolysis, superheated steam, ozone and promession. Plasma pyrolysis Plasma pyrolysis involves plasma arc torches or electrodes which use ionized gas in the plasma state to convert electrical energy to super high temperatures, up to several thousand degrees Celsius. The process operates in presence of little or no air. Superheated steam This technology uses superheated steam at 500C to pul verize infectious, hazardous chemical or pharmaceutical wastes. These steams are further heated up to temperatures of 1500C. These technologies are expensive and pollution control equipment prior to the release of the gas from the system are required. Ozone Ozone (0 3) gas can be used as a disinfecting agent for waste. Ozone (0 3) can break down to more stable forms such as Oxygen (0 2) easily. The wastes are shredded and exposed to the agent. As exposure to higher concentration of ozone can cause physical harm, occupational safety needs to be considered. Promession Promession combines a mechanical process with the removal of heat to destroy pathological waste. It uses liquid nitrogen and mechanical vibration to disintegrate the pathological waste into a powder before burial. The emerging technologies still need to be carefully evaluated and have long way to go before they are ready for regular application. 6.5 MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS HCW According to Solid Waste Management Act 2011, the responsibility for processing and management of hazardous waste, medical waste, chemical waste and industrial waste under the prescribed standards goes to the person or institution that has generated the waste (NLC 2011). Thus, the responsibility of management of HCWs of the HCF is the responsibility of the chief of the facility. This chapter provides basic guidance for the management of HCW for different categories of the waste types. A table for the treatment option and its applicability is provided in the matrix below along with the detailed description of the waste types and various technologies applicable. Table 2: Types of waste and various treatment technologies applicable Type of Waste Category Infectious Sharps Pathological Chemical Pharmaceutical Cytotoxic Type of technologies Biological Procedure No No Yes No No No Autoclave Yes Yes No No No No Microwave Yes Yes No No No No Chemical Treatment Yes Yes No Yes No Yes 37 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Type of Waste Category Infectious Sharps Pathological Chemical Pharmaceutical Cytotoxic Encapsulation and Inertization No Yes No Yes Yes Yes Sanitary Landfill Yes after sterilization Yes after encapsulation No Yes after encapsulatio n Yes after encapsulation Yes after encapsulatio n Burial Yes after sterilization Yes after encapsulation Yes No No No Septic Concrete Vault Yes after sterilization Yes No No No No 6.5.1 Infectious Waste 1. Autoclave Autoclave treatment of infectious waste is the preferred option under this document for federal, provincial and local level hospitals. Treatment of such waste prior to disposal is mandatory for the health care facilities, where no off-site treatment is available. Air exhausted from autoclave operations must be treated by passing it through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter or steam treatment. Volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, chemotherapeutic waste, mercury, other hazardous chemical waste and radiological waste should not be treated in an autoclave. Performance of autoclave units shall be verified periodically using biological indicators. 2. Chemical disinfection Where chemical disinfection of waste is permitted, aldehydes, chlorine compounds, or phenolic compounds may be applied to waste to inactivate pathogens. Chemical disinfection is the preferred treatment for liquid infectious wastes, but it can also be used in treating solid infectious waste when such material is shredded prior to disinfection. This technique is most suitable in treating blood, urine, stools and sewage. 3. Others: Besides these technologies, various other non-burn technologies can be used for the treatment o f the infectious waste. Technologies such as microwave, frictional heat based, integrated steam-based technologies are some examples of the other technologies that can be used for the treatment of infectious waste 6.5.2 Sharps Waste 1. Autoclave Infectious sharp waste such as used needles, blades, glass slides used in laboratory and others can be treated with autoclaves prior to disposal. Sharp waste such as needle of the syringes can be destroyed in the needle cutters to minimize the risk during the handling of such waste. 2. Encapsulation: The sharp waste can be encapsulated and sent to landfill after autoclaving if infectious. These waste needs to be carefully handled. The waste once autoclaved, can be encapsulated and landfilled. 3. Septic Concrete Vault: 38 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Sharps waste can be collected and disposed of in septic concrete vault. These wastes need to handle with care due to its potential hazards. Both the glass and the metal sharps can be disposed in the septic concrete vault. These vaults need to sealed with cement mortar once is filled and next vault can be constructed for further use. 6.5.3 Pathological waste disposal 1. Placenta pits The dimensions of a placenta pit depend on the average number of births and infiltration rate of the soil. The bottom of the pit should be at least 1.5m from the groundwater level. Placenta pits should not be used in sites where the water table is near the surface or in areas prone to flooding. When the level of waste reaches a height of 0.5 m underneath the slab a thick layer of wood ash should be applied to the surface and the pit should be closed to further use for a minimum of two-years. The pit should be constructed at a distance of 25 meters away from the water sources. 2. Anaerobic digestion: Biodegradable health care waste can be fed to an anaerobic digester, which results in fuel and compost. It is not recommended to fed the digester with only pathological waste. Wastes such as pathological waste should be fed in small amount compared to other general biodegradable waste. Digester fed with pathological waste needs to be monitored closely and should occur in a controlled system. It is not recommended to use the slurry as manure. Histopathological waste mixed with formaldehyde should not be fed into the digester. Such waste should be either encapsulated or disposed in controlled landfill. 6.5.4 Pharmaceutical waste disposal 1. Return back policy The waste after its expiry can be returned back to the suppliers for proper management of the pharmaceutical waste. 2. Procurement policy The health facilities needs to make sure to prescribe as less medicine as possible. For example, the health care provided should be able to limit the use of antibiotics. 3. Encapsulation/Inertization Pharmaceutical waste may be encapsulated. The waste must be inertized prior to encapsulation. Solid, liquid, and semi-liquid wastes can be encapsulated in metal drums 4. Sanitary Landfill disposal Small quantities of pharmaceutical waste produced on a daily basis may be landfilled provided that they are inertized and encapsulated. Large quantities of pharmaceutical wastes shall not be landfilled unless the wastes are encapsulated and disposed of in a sanitary landfill. They shall not be disposed of with general waste nor shall they be diluted and discharged into sewers. 5. Discharge to a sewer 39 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Moderate quantities of mild liquid or semi-liquid pharmaceuticals such as solutions containing vitamins, proteins, intravenous solutions, may be diluted in a large flow of water and discharged into municipal sewers or the hos pitals' septic tanks. All pharmaceut ical wastes should not be disposed of into slow-moving or stagnant water. Antibiotics, cytotoxic drugs and hormonal drugs needs to be disposed separately in controlled manner. A separate guideline needs to be developed for its disposal. 6.5.5 Chemical waste disposal Chemical wastes should be stored in leak-proof containers and labelled to identify the contents. Hazardous chemical wastes of different composition should be stored separately to avoid unwanted chemical reactions. Any waste that cannot be properly treated should be handled and disposed of by an authorized waste management organization. 1. Return back policy Hazardous chemical can be returned to the original supplier who should be equipped to deal with them safely. 2. Encapsulation / Inertization Small amount of chemical waste may be encapsulated. The waste must be inertized prior to encapsulation. Solid, liquid, and semi-liquid wastes can be encapsulated in metal drums. Large amounts of chemical disinfectants should never be encapsulated as they are corrosive and sometimes flammable. 3. Discharge to a sewer Non-hazardous chemical wastes such as sugars, amino acids and certain organic and inorganic salts, which are widely used in transfusion liquids can be disposed into the sewer system or the health facility septic tank. Hazardous chemical wastes should not be discharged into sewerage systems. 4. Burial Pit Non-hazardous chemical waste may be disposed in the burial pit. Large amounts of chemical waste should not be buried as they may contaminate water sources. 6.5.6 Cytotoxic waste disposal 1. Limitations on use of cytotoxic drugs The use of cytotoxic drugs should be limited to specialized (e.g oncological) health-care facilities which are better able to handles those waste. Health-care facilities, using cytotoxic products, must develop specific guidelines on their safe handling for the protection of personnel and the environment in their health-care waste management plans. 2. Requirements for procurement of cytotoxic drugs Provision should be made in the procurement of all cytotoxic drugs that expired and disused supplies must be taken back by the supplier for safe disposal upon request of the purchasing unit. 3. Chemical degradation and neutralization: 40 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Most of these methods are relatively simple and safe, they include oxidation by potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) or sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4), de-nitration by hydrobromic acid (HBr), or reduction by nickel and aluminium. The methods are not appropriate for the treatment of contaminated body fluids. Chemical neutralization through Advance Oxidation using Sodium hypochlorite can be applied as alternative method for the treatment of cytotoxic waste on the principles of chemical oxidation. 4. Encapsulation Small quantities of cytotoxic wastes can be encapsulated and sent to landfill for final disposal. 6.5.7 Radioactive Waste Materials 1. Limitations on use of radioactive materials. The use of radioactive should be limited to specialized (e.g oncological) health-care facilities which are better able to handles those waste. Health-care facilities, using radio-active materials, must develop specific guidelines on their safe handling for the protection of personnel and the environment in their health-care waste management plans. 2. Requirements for procurement of equipment with radioactive materials Provision should be made in the procurement of all radioactive materials that expired and disused supplies must be taken back by the supplier for safe disposal upon request of the purchasing unit. 3. Decay: As radio isotopes decay itself with time. If stored in a leak proof container for 10* half-life, it will lose 99.9% of its radio activity which is considered to be at safe level. Leak proof container means shielding with lead which blocks 99.9% of the radio activity to go outside. This is the most common practice because the half-life for maximum isotopes are not more than few days. 4. Disposal to general waste stream: Vials, cotton swabs, syringes, tissue paper are considered low activity articles which can be disposed as other medical waste if activity is less than 1.35 micro-curies. 5. Drainage: Liquid Isotopes with activity less than 1 micro-curies can be drained to the sewer with adequate flushing with water. However, amount of daily allowances is different for different isotopes. 6. Burial: Exclusively, for Isotopes with long half-life. e. g. Half-life in years. But these isotopes are rarely used. Burial site should be approved for radioactivity. 6.6 MONITORING AND EVALUATION Regular monitoring and evaluation of the plan in each HCF should be performed. Regular reviews help in identifying potential loopholes and bottle necks and enable the HCFs to reveal new issues which may arise while managing HCW. Formulating recommendations and pointing out shortcoming of the programs also provides an opportunity to involve and educate staff and furthermore reinforces good practices. The monitoring and evaluation process should be conducted by the HCWM committee in frequent intervals on compliance of rules, regulations and HCWM standards specified in section 10 of this document 41 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 7. CIRCULA R ECONOMY Circular Economy The concept of circular economy envisions a system in which end-of-life products can be reused, recycled or reinvented into new usefu l products. Rather than a cradle-to grave system, this emphasize the cradle- to- cradle system which generates revenue and saves resources with minimum production of waste. It is aligned with the concept of zero waste. In economics the approaches to move away from a linear economy to a more sustainable alternative can be summarized under the idea of a circular economy. Core ideas of the circular economy idea are show in figure 3. Integration of policies on materials, product and chemicals management, and use of life-cycle oriented waste and materials management and related policies is an important aspect in achieving resource efficiency and productivity. Examples include 3R policies (reduce, reuse, recycle), sustainable materials management, sustainable manufacturing, resource efficiency and circular economy policies. Waste prevention can be encouraged through eco-design, reuse, repair, refurbishment, re-manufacturing, and extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes. (OECD 2020) 8. HEALTH AND SAFETY PRACTICES Management of HCW is an integral part of hospital hygiene and infection control. HCW should be considered as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms, which can cause contamination and give rise to infection. If waste is inadequately managed, these micro-organisms can be transmitted by direct contact, in the air, or by a variety of vectors. Infectious waste may lead to the risk of nosocomial infections, putting the health of hospital personnel and patients at risk. It must be emphasized here that other environmental health considerations, such as adequate water supply and sanitation facilities for patients, visitors, and health care staff are also of prime importance. HCWM plans should include provision for the continuous monitoring of workers' health and safety to ensure that correct handling, treatment, storage and disposal procedures are being followed. Essential occupational health and safety measures include the following basic measures: Proper training of workers (no training/no hiring policy should be instituted; immunization on the first day of work). Provision of equipment and clothing for personal protection. Figure 5 : Flow chart with steps to achieve a circular economy (UNIDO 2017) 42 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Establishment of an effective occupational health program that includes immunization, post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment and continuous medical surveillance. Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities. Training on health and safety should ensure that workers know and understand the potential risks associated with HCW, the value of immunization against viral hepatitis B and the importance of consistent use of personal protection equipment (PPE). Workers at risk include health care providers, hospital cleaners, maintenance workers, operators of waste treatment equipment, and all operators involved in waste handling and disposal within and outside health care establishments. 8.1 INFECTION PREVENTION Everyone who works at, receives care at or visits HCFs is at risk of infections. Thus, infection prevention is the responsibility of everyone. As a result of being at a HCF, staf f, clients and visitors may be exposed to infectious diseases that others at the facility have. We can, however, prevent transmission of infections in many cases. The only way to prevent infections is to stop the transmission of micro-organisms that cause infections. The best way to prevent infection is by following standard precautions, which include the following: Washing hands often and thoroughly. Wear ing PPE such as gloves, eye protection, face-shields, and gowns. Use of tongs for separation of waste if ever required. Following appropriate respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette. Preventing injuries by correctly handling sharps. Correctly processing instruments and client-care equipment. Maintaining correct environmental cleanliness and waste-disposal practices. Handling, transporting and processing used and potentially soiled linens correctly. 8.2 PERSONAL HYGIENE AND HAND HYGIENE Basic personal hygiene is important for reducing the risks from handling HCW, and convenient washing facilities (with warm water and soap) should be available for personnel involved. As the hands of health care workers are the most frequent vehicle of nosocomial infections; hand hygiene including both hand washing and hand disinfection are the primary preventive measures. An antimicrobial soap will reduce the transient flora, only if the standard procedure for hand washing is applied. Hand washing with non-medicated soap is essential when hands are dirty and should be routine after physical contact with a patient. Killing all transient flora with all contaminants within a short time (few seconds) necessitates hygienic hand disinfection. Only alcohol or alcoholic preparations act sufficiently fast. Hands should be disinfected with alcohol when an infected tissue or body fluid is touched without gloves. 8.3 WORKERS ' PROTECTION The generation, segregation, collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of HCW involves the handling of potentially hazardous and infectious material. Protection against personal injury is, therefore, essential for all workers who are directly involved in handling potentially hazardous and infectious HCW. The individuals responsible for the management of HCW should ensure that all risks are identified and that suitable protection from those risks is provided. A comprehensive risk assessment of all activities involved in HCWM should be carried out during the preparation of the 43 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 HCWM plan, which will allow the identification of necessary protection measures. These measures should be designed to prevent exposure to hazardous materials or other risks, or at least to keep exposure within safe limits (WHO 1999). Suitable training should be provided to the related personnel on this aspect. 8.3.1 Protective clothing The type of protective clothing usage depend s, to an extent, upon the risk associated with the HCW. The following should be made available to all personnel who are directly involved to collect and handle HCWs: Helmets or cap with or without visors, depending on the operation Face masks, depending on operation Disposable gloves (medical staff), utility gloves or heavy-duty gloves (waste workers), both obligatory Eye protectors (safety goggles), depending on operation Overalls (coveralls), obligatory Aprons, obligatory Leg protectors and or boots, obligatory Boots and heavy-duty gloves are particularly important for waste workers. The thick soles of the boots offer protection in the storage area, as a precaution from spilled sharps, and where floors are slippery. If segregation is inadequate, needles or other sharp items may have been placed in plastic bags; such items may also pierce thin-walled or weak plastic containers. If it is likely that HCW bags will come into contact with workers' legs during handling, leg protectors may also need to be worn. An example of appropriate PPE is shown in Figure 6. 8.3.2 Immunization Viral hepatitis B infections have been reported among health care personnel and waste handlers, and immunization against the disease is; therefore, recommended. Tetanus immunization is also recommended for all personnel handling waste. 8.3.3 Injection Safety Medical professionals and health care workers must be made aware on the injection safety . Injections are most commonly used among health care procedure worldwide. In developing and transitional countries alone, some 16 thousand million injections are administered each year. Most injections, more than 90%, are given for therapeutic purposes while 5 to 10% are given for preventive services, including immunization and family planning procedures. (WHO 2015) A safe injection does not harm the recipient, does not expose the health care worker to any avoidable risk and does not result in waste that is dangerous for the community. Unsafe injection practices (reuse of syringes and needles in the absen ce of sterilization) must be discouraged. The disposable needle and syringe should be rendered useless after use. The needle from the syringe should be cut/crushed and disposed safely. Figure 6 : An example of full set of PPE 44 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 8.3.4 Response to injury and exposure Health care facility should establish program that prescribes the actions to be taken in the event of injury or exposure to a hazardous substance. All staf fs who handle HCW should be trained to deal with injuries and exposures. The program should include the following elements: Immediate first-aid measures, such as cleansing of wounds and skin, and irrigation (splashing) of eyes with clean water. An immediate report of the incident to a designated responsible person. Retention, if possible, of the item involved in the incident; details of its source for identification of possible infection. Additional medical attention in an accident and emergency or occupational health department, as soon as possible; such as availability of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Medical surveillance Blood or other tests if indicated. Recording of the incident; Investigation of the incident, and identification and implementation of remedial action to prevent similar incidents in the future. The purpose of incident reporting should not be seen as punitive; active support by managers should encourage prompt and accurate reporting. 8.3.5 Special precautions for spillages of potentially hazardous substances Spillage usually requires clean-up of the only contaminated area. For clearing up spillages of body fluids or other potentially hazardous substances, particularly if there is any risk of splashing, eye protectors and masks should be worn, in addition to gloves and overalls. Respirators (gas masks) are also needed if an activity is particularly dangerous, for e.g., if it involves toxic dusts, the clearance of incinerator residues, or the cleaning of contaminated equipment. Residues should be recovered as completely as possible using hand tools (e.g. a shovel), and then packed safely. It is especially important to recover spilled droplets of metallic mercury. If a leakage or spillage involves infectious material, the floor should be cleaned and disinfected after most of the waste has been recovered. 8.4 SAFE USE OF CYTOTOXIC DRUGS AND RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS Health care facilities, which use cytotoxic products and radioactive materials, should develop specific guidelines on their safe handling for the protection of personnel and the environment. It is difficult to ensure safe use of cytotoxic and radioactive material, it is recommended that the use of these substances be limited to specialized (e.g., oncological) HCFs, which are better able to implement safety measures. The guidelines handling cytotoxic products should include rules on the following waste handling procedures: Separate collection of waste in leak proof bags or containers, and labelling for identification Return of date expired drugs to suppliers. Take back policy should be applied for these kinds of materials. Agreement should be signed while purchasing the cytotoxic and radioactive materials and these materials should be collected back by the suppliers after usage. Safe storage separately from other HCW Provisions for the disposal of contaminated material, for the decontamination of reusable equipment, and for the treatment of spillages. 45 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 Provisions for the treatment of infectious waste contaminated with cytotoxic products, including excreta from patients and disposable linen used for patients. Hospital staff should ensure that the families of patients undergoing chemotherapy are aware of the risks and know how they can be minimized or avoided. Minimal protective measures for all waste workers who handle cytotoxic waste should include protective clothing, gloves, goggles and masks. 8.5 EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN CASE OF SPILLAGE Spillage is the most common type of emergency involving infectious and other hazardous materials. Spills are inadvertent discharges that occur at different place of HCF. Spills include accidental tipping over containers, dropping and breaking of containers. It may also occur during manual transfer, overfilling and leaks in the process. The response process for the spillage includes: Evacuation of the contaminated area. Immediate decontamination of the eyes and skin of exposed personnel immediately. Informing immediate supervisor for the further action. Appropriate PPE should be worn before the clean-up process. Neutralization or disinfection of the contaminated materials and area. Collect all spilled materials. (in case of blood and other fluids, apply 0.5% chlorine solution for 10 minutes and then collect/ In case of chemical spill, it has to be neutralized prior to collection of the materials) The decontamination should be carried out by working from the least to the most contaminated part, with a change of cloth at each stage. Dry cloths should be used in the case of liquid spillage; for spillages of solids, cloth impregnated with water (acidic, basic or neutral, as appropriate) should be used. The area should be properly rinsed and wiped with absorbent cloth. Impacts must be limited on patients, medical, other personnel and environment. In case of skin contact with hazardous substances, immediate decontamination needs to take place by washing In case of eye contact with corrosive chemicals, the eye should be irrigated continuously with clean water for 10- 30 minutes. For this, the entire face should be submerged in a basin with eyes being continuously opened and closed. 9. HEALTHCARE WASTE MANAGEMENT IN AN EMERGENCY Emergency can be of different kinds ranging from natural disasters like earthquake, landslide, flood, fire to medical emergencies like disease endemic/pandemic (e.g Ebola, Covid-19 etc). In all kind of emergency, the major issues are generation of huge volume of health care waste and its management by selecting appropriate waste treatment technologies. During emergency it is advised to do quick rapid assessment to identify the waste generation volume, population affected and types of waste which helps for further development of quick action plan for individual, organization and team involved for emergency management. As per WHO emergency guideline, as a basic starting point and to avoid sharp infection and injuries, health care waste generated during healthcare activities in any setting like tent, temporary hospitals, mobile hospitals, camps should be segregated using three bin system that is collecting waste as sharps, 46 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 general and hazardous and needs to keep separately until its treatment and final disposal. Burial of sharps and other waste in pits or trenches may be considered as an interim solution in emergency situations following the national standard. Burning of healthcare waste is not desirable, but if there is more risk of spreading highly infectious diseases through the waste and it is only the option available in emergency, it should be undertaken in a confined area (burning within a dugout pit, followed by covering with a layer of soil). But it is highly discouraged even for emergency and is not the management option if other options can be feasible. In any condition, plastic waste is never burnt. Different preventive measures should be followed during an emergency response to reduce occupational health risks: Provide hepatitis B vaccine to all healthcare staffs and waste handlers involved in emergency response Use PPE by waste handlers with appropriate training or mentoring on it Practice hand hygiene (frequent washing with soap water or use alcohol-based hand rubber) Contain and promptly clean up spillage of infectious materials and disinfect quickly to avoid pathogen transmission As an emergency response progresses and more aid resources become available, the management of healthcare waste should be as per national standard and needs to be segregated on standard color-coded bins for different types of waste. 9.1 WASTE MINIMIZATION IN AN EMERGENCY : Where feasible, minimizing the amount of waste that is produced by a health care facility is a good waste management practice. Waste minimization is most commonly applied at the point of generation, but it can also happen before items even enter the health care facility. Some examples of good waste minimization practice include: Selecting materials with minimal packaging, choosing equipment that can be reprocessed locally, changing (or substituting) products etc. Segregation and packaging: Segregate and use hazardous bag for packaging the waste following national standard. If in emergency hazardous bag are not available, containers for non-sharp waste should be washed and disinfected after being emptied. Dead Body should be safely stored and disposed of depending upon types of emergency and following local culture and customs. For instance, in disease pandemic situation which has a chance to spread infection even from dead bodies should be avoided in contact with others and dispose of following national guideline of dead body management. 9.2 COLLECTION AND TRANSPORTATION : All the waste bins shall be emptied once it is \u00be full and cleared away from the patients' area at least once every day Exclusively allocated trolleys should be used. Two transp ortation trollies, one for the hazardous waste and other for the general waste shall be used. These trollies shall be place with appropriate bins, properly labelled, easy to load/unload, easy to clean and with no sharp edges. 47 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 All the biohazard bags collected shall be properly labelled (date, name of unit, type of waste) and are tied/closed with rope/lock before collection. The bags or containers shall be replaced immediately with new ones of the same type. 9.3 STORAGE Segregated waste should be stored preferably in specific restricted waste storage area. The area should be locked room or guarded enclosure. If the room is not available, a large container with lids may be used for temporary storage and be kept in a restricted area with a symbol that is understood locally to differentiate general and hazardous waste. These areas shall have adequate lighting, ventilation and provision for the containment of spills (infectious, chemical) and be protected from sun, rain and wind and always kept clean. Infectious wastes shall not be stored for more than 24 hours during the hot season and 48 hours during the cold season. 9.4 TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL : Any treatment technologies that might have substantial impact on environment and public health shall be considered as transitional means of treatment and disposal and immediately replaced with environment friendly technologies. All the waste generated shall be treated prior to disposal. Alternative treatments shall be designed for the treatment of infectious health care waste, such as steam treatment methods. Steam treatment shall preferably be on-site, although once treated, sterile/non-infectious waste may be mutilated and disposed of in municipal landfill. The treatment processes shall be validated and periodically tested to ensure they function properly using biological indicators (e.g.: spores) or other test assays. Needle cutters/destroyers shall be used in all the locations where syringes are used. Decontaminated sharps waste can be disposed of in concrete-lined sharps pits on facility premises or encapsulated by mixing waste with immobilizing material, such as cement, before disposal. Liquid infectious waste can be disposed of directly into a closed sewer system (such as a utility sink drain or flushable toilet) or onsite septic tank system by staff wearing PPE and taking precautions to avoid splashing. If neither is available, this waste should be poured directly into a pit latrine. Disposing of liquid infectious waste into pipes that go to open drainage canals should not be conducted without pre-treatment. If you use the sink or toilet for disposal of liquid infectious waste, be sure to thoroughly rinse with water and clean and disinfect the sink or toilet using 0.5% chlorine solution to remove residual waste. In resource constraints settings as per emergency types, minimal treatment and disposal practices should continue to be used as following: Onsite burial in pits or trenches (follow national standard) Disposal in special designated area in municipal dumping sites Burning in a dugout pit and then covering with soil (less desirable) Encapsulation or inertization can be used to dispose of small quantities of sharps, chemicals, or pharmaceutical waste . 48 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 10. TRAINING Training of health care providers is crucial for the successful implementation of the health care waste management programme. The overall aim of training is to enhance the knowledge, skill and attitude of health care provider on health, safety, and environmental issues relating to health-care waste, and how these can affect employees in their daily work. It should highlight the roles and responsibi lities of health-care personnel in the overall management of programme. 10.1 TRAINING RESPONSIBILITY The need identification of the HCWM training will be done by Management Division at the central level and provincial Health Directorate at the provincial level. National Health Training Centre (NHTC) in coordination with the Management Division/ DoHS is responsible for development of learning resource package and pool of trainers on HCWM. The pool of trained personnel on integrated package of HCWM will roll out training on HCWM at sub national level in coordination with Provincial Health Training Centre and Provincial Health Directorate. The record of all training sessions should be well documented in systematic manner. The content of the training programs should be periodically reviewed and updated as per latest technological development and requirements. The Administration/Management Section of health care facilities should ensure that all staffs of HCFs are aware about HCWM plan and their roles, responsibilities and commitment in this regard. 10.2 TRAINING MODALITY The training modality can be Whole site which includes managerial level staff as well as staff working at the ground level of the whole health facility. Likewise, group-based training can also be organised as per need. 10.3 TRAINING APPROACH Cascade model of training approach will be implemen ted for rolling out integrated package of HCWM. NHTC in coordination with Management Division will develop Pool of trainers at the federal and provincial level. The trained personnel on training package will then further organise training at the province and local level. 10.4 ROLLING OUT TRAINING Environmental Health and Healthcare Waste Managemen t Section/ Management Division will be responsible to ensure required technical and fin ancial resource in order develop the training package and rolling out the training throughout the countr y 10.5 TRAINING PACKAGE National Health Training Centre (NHTC) will develop a comprehensive training package on HCWM in close coordination with Environmental Health and Healthcare Waste Management Section/ Management Division, Department of Health Service/ MoHP. The package should be suitable for various types of HCFs, including government, private, teaching and dental hospitals, polyclinics, hea lth centre, health care research institutions and medical laboratories. The document will also be useful for more general educational establishments and for organizations that provide services for HCW management and disposal. The training package including reference materials will be as per NHTC standard and MOHP/Government of Nepal will approve it. This integrated training 49 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 package on HCWM, Environmental Health and WASH including Management module will be recommended for comprehensive knowledge management and skill enhancement for all. 10.6 EMPLOYEES TO BE TRAINED Training: All hospital personnel, including medical doctors, public health officials should be convinced of the need for a comprehensive HCWM plan and the related training. Separate training activities should be designed for the following personnel: Hospital managers, public health officials and administrative staff responsible for implementing regulations on HCWM. Medical doctors Nurses and Paramedical staffs, cleaners, porters, staff and waste handlers Orientation: In addition to this, there should be orientation programme planned for patients, visitors at HF level and awareness programme to surrounding community on basic knowledge on HCWM like segregation at source and safe disposal. A separate module of orientation package including Management Module to managers and decision makers on Integrated HCWM can be developed and implemented at all levels. 10.7 CONTENT The training program should include: Information on, and justification for, all aspects of the health care waste plan Information on the role and responsibilities of each hospital staff member in implementing the plan Technical instructions, relevant for the target group, on the application of waste management practices. These should be periodically reviewed and updated. Periodic repetition of courses will provide refreshment training as well as orientation for new employees and for existing employees with new responsibilities; it will also update knowledge in line with policy changes. In general, the training should include the following information: Concept of health care waste and basic steps for health care waste management Legal provisions, policies and international commitmen ts Impact of HCW on health and environment Health care waste management Management of mercury spill Injection safety Health and safety Health care waste management at different levels of HCF Field visit and action plan 10.8 SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS AND TRAINERS The ideal number of participants in a training course is 20. The ratio of trainers and trainees will be 1:4. Courses should be aimed at all categories of personnel; discussions may be easier and more 50 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 useful if the group is composed of trainees from various disciplines (e.g. supervisors, medical and nursing staff, laboratory staff, engineers, health officials). It may also be valuable to include senior administration staff and heads of departments in certain training groups to demonstrate their commitment to the waste management policy and to show the relevance of the policy to all personnel of health care establishments. Subject experts and TOT holders on the training package will be the facilitators of the training. Senior Officers from Management Division and NHTC will be resource person for the training. 11. RAISING AWARENESS 11.1 PUBLIC EDUCATION ON HAZARDS LINKED TO HEALTH -CARE WASTE Promotion of the appropriate handling and disposal of medical waste is important for community health, and every member of the community should have the right to be informed about potential health hazards. The objectives of public education on health-care waste are the following: To prevent exposure to health-care waste and related health hazards To create awareness and foster responsibility among hospital patients and visitors to health- care establishments regarding hygiene and HCWM. To inform the public about the risks linked to HCWM. Various IEC/BCC activities will be carried out for public education on risks, waste segregation, or waste disposal practices. 51 Healthcare waste management standards and operating procedures 2020 12.
