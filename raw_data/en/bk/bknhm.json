Studies show that regularly volunteering has a positive impact on our mental and physical health and strengthens our social connections. Not only does volunteering counteract the effects of stress, anger, anxiety and depression but it also makes you overall happier and can increase your self-confidence. It is in our nature as human beings to want to give to others. Sharing our talents and passions in our community through volunteering helps to give us all the feels and fulfills that natural instinct to want to help others. The more we give, ultimately, the better we feel. Another positive effect to highlight is that volunteering helps to build both your personal and professional network. Shared experiences help to create and strengthen social connections and by participating in a volunteer activity you are connecting with others who also share a common interest. This is a great way to make friends and to create networks.
