Alternative Medicine / Supplements What are alternative medicine and functional medicine? Functional medicine represents true holistic care. Practitioner of functional medicine, such as Dr. Dharma, take the time to learn about the aspects of your life that work together to cause health problems, including your medical history, emotional health, genetics, lifestyle, diet and nutrition, and environmental influences. Problems in one or several of those areas may contribute to your symptoms, and you can't regain your health if the symptoms are treated without addressing all of the underlying issues. Alternative medicine uses diverse therapies instead of conventional western medications. Examples of alternative treatments include traditional herbal medicine, chiropractic care, acupuncture, yoga, biofeedback, and massage therapy. Southwest Family Medicine Associates is one of the few functional medicine clinics that use insurance for the visit. The Southwest Family Medicine team works with two nutriceutical companies to make it easy for you to obtain high-quality supplements with consistent doses of herbal products and no fillers: Designs for Health (DFH), and Metagenics. Various products from these two trusted brands have consistently provided clinically significant results. So many over-the-counter supplements do not contain enough product to treat your condition, so ask for the brands these doctors recommend. What is natural medicine? Natural or herbal medicine uses ingredients found in diverse types of plants for medicinal purposes. Active ingredients extracted from a plant's seeds, berries, roots, leaves, bark, or flowers are used to make supplements. Examples of some of the most commonly used herbal supplements at Southwest Family Medicine Associates include: - Metabolic Synergy: a multivitamin and mineral supplement containing nutrients for balancing blood sugars; ideal for prediabetic or diabetic patients - Chromium Synergy (DFH): utilized for insulin function and blood sugar regulation, this product's added cinnamon assists with blood sugar control; this chelated mineral allows for good absorption, making it very effective - FemGuard: promotes hormonal balance for more regular cycles, safe conversion of estrogen, healthy detoxification, and proper elimination of excess estrogen hormones; may reduce PMS and perimenopausal/menopausal symptoms - Water Ease: contains taurine and vitamin B6 for use as a natural diuretic, regulating water balance without causing a loss or imbalance of minerals in the body - HTN Complex: for patients with hypertension, this supplement acts like a natural diuretic and protects endothelial function while regulating renin It's important to consult experts, such as Dr. Dharma before buying herbal supplements because their active ingredients may interact with medications or affect some health conditions.

Metformin decreases CoQ10, vitamin B12, and folate. ACE inhibitors like lisinopril increase potassium and decrease zinc.
