It is tailored to specific patient positions on vaccination and provides a structured approach to assist HWs with interpersonal communication during COVID -19 vaccination consultations. Intended Audience HWs directly involved in COVID -19 vaccination consultations; Clinical and Immunization Programme Managers; Trainers of Trainers ( ToTs ); HW bodies and organizations; Immunization advocates and champions. 3Overview of training module Part 1: Vaccine confidence and the role of health workers Part 2: Communicating risk to patients Part 3: Vaccine acceptance and demand Part 4: Responding to different patient positions Part 5: Putting the pieces together Part 6: Being pro -active to promote vaccine confidence & acceptance 45Expectations for this training module A self -paced learning tool to be completed independently or facilitated by a ToT. Facilitators/ ToTs can adjust content to allow for local considerations. Participants are guided through slides focusing on a combination of theory and practical skill building scenarios. Scenarios demonstrate research -based strategies for effectively discussing vaccines during vaccination consultations that can be utilized in the participant's clinical practice. Content is intended to be practical and adaptable to most vaccine consultation settings. Expected duration for completion: 3 hours. Completion of the pre -and post -training self -reflection and post -training feedback survey is important to consolidate learning and evaluate the module.6Pre-training self -reflection Insert link to survey 7Setting the scene for health workers Training Objectives: 1. To support you in your role to confidently recommend the COVID -19 vaccine to your patients. 2. To provide you with communication strategies and tools you can use to: Facilitate effective conversations during vaccination consultations, Inform your patients about COVID -19 vaccines, Promote COVID -19 vaccine uptake. \u00a9 iStock8Learning outcomes At the end of this training module, the participant will be able to: 1.Define vaccine confidence and explain the impact of HWs; 2.Understand and communicate risk to support a patient's vaccination decision; 3.Examine vaccine acceptance and demand to understand patients' vaccination behavior; 4.Describe vaccine hesitancy and factors that contribute to it in the context of COVID -19; 5.Identify the different attitudes and positions of patients about COVID -19 vaccination; 6.Determine appropriate communication needs and identify communication goals for a COVID -19 vaccination consultation aligned with the patient's position about vaccination; 7.Apply a structured approach using strategies grounded in motivational interviewing to respond to concerns regarding COVID -19 vaccine safety and effectiveness; 8.Deliver clear, concise messages to encourage COVID -19 vaccine confidence and acceptance; 9.Provide guidance to patients to correctly identify credible sources of information on COVID -19 vaccination and vaccine safety.9 Part 1: Vaccine confidence & the role of health workers \u00a9 WHO 10 Health Worker Opportunity: To promote vaccine confidenceI'm not too sure that it's safe to be vaccinated. This virus doesn't exist! Vaccine companies just want money...We don't really need this vaccine, we're young and healthy!I was already sick with COVID so I don't need the vaccine.Unknown effects of this new vaccine might be worse than COVID! I heard COVID is like the flu and I was so sick last year after my flu shot..I don't like needles.How are concerns about COVID -19 vaccines expressed? 11What is vaccine confidence? Thetrust that public HWs have in: Recommended vaccines; HWs who administer vaccines; Processes and policies that lead to vaccine development, licensure, manufacturing, and recommendations for use. MacDonald, E, N. 2015. Vaccine hesitancy: Definition, scope and determinants US CDC. 2021. Vaccinate with confidence12How do health workers impact vaccine confidence? HWs may underestimate their influence + don't have much time to talk about vaccines or lack vaccine confidenceA HW recommendation is a major driver of vaccine uptakeMost trusted advisors and influencers of vaccination decisions. A HW's strong recommendation is a strong facilitator of vaccination uptake. A HW's relationship with patients supports them in their decision to vaccinate. Patients require consistent and accurate information about vaccine safety and benefits from all their health care providers, conveyed in a respectful and positive manner. Dub\u00e9, E., et al. 2013. Vaccine Hesitancy, An Overview. 13 Part 2: Communicating risk to patients \u00a9 WHO / Country Office Georgia14Risk perception and decision -making Disease and vaccination are associated with risk. A person may think disease is likely and/or severe and may feel vaccine side -effects are likely and/or severe. The general rule : if people perceive high levels of risk of vaccination, they will become less likely to vaccinate.if people perceive high levels of risk of disease, they will be more likely to vaccinate; WHO. 2017. Vaccination and trust15Communicating risk Goal of effective risk communication: Develop an informed decision making partnership. Health Workers play a vital role in the success of immunization programs by providing information through risk communication.Risk perception is influenced by experience as well as personal, religious and cultural contexts.Vaccination requires effective risk communication It is essential that the public: understands the risks associated with vaccine - preventable diseases; understands the benefits and risks associated with vaccines; knows where to find accurate, trustworthy and clear information about these. Common for new vaccines to be met with initial hesitancy. Public concern about vaccine safety can reduce vaccine coverage rates and result in the resurgence of vaccinepreventable diseases. When communicating risk with patients be aware of cultural and emotional differences keeping in mind some people are adversarial or misinformed. Lewandowsky, S., et al. 2021. The COVID -19 Vaccine Communication Handbook; WHO. 2017. Vaccination and trust16Principles of risk communication Respect differences of opinion about vaccination Some patients will express reluctance or refusal to accept the vaccine for themselves or their family members. Ask permission to explore underlying reasons without being judgmental. Adopt a patient centred approach Effective decision - making is best done in a partnership between the Health Worker and patient. Individuals have input into the decision to vaccinate and retain responsibility for their own health. Communicate current knowledge Consider what your patient already knows. Use varied information formats tailored to educational levels and languages. Provide guidance on how to assess website reliability and provide a list of reliable ones. Your professional opinion matters Your strong recommendation to get vaccinated has been shown to increase uptake. Use statements such as, \"I believe this vaccine will protect you\". Remember: A trusted Health Worker is proven to be essential in the decision - making process. Represent risks and benefits of vaccines fairly and openly Contrast known versus theoretical risks of the vaccine with known risks associated with the vaccine preventable infection. Present clear, concise evidence based messages Encourage questions, address misinformation, and provide credible and appropriate resources, for those who want more information. Respond to specific concerns avoiding lengthy discussions. Reaffirm your conviction that the vaccine is important to prevent serious disease and complications. Adapted from the Public Health Agency of Canada. 2008. Immunization competencies for health professionals5. Recommend pain mitigation strategies 1. Provide reassurance the COVID -19 vaccine is safe and effective, providing protection against coronavirus. 2.

Risk of severe illness and serious complications from COVID -19 far outweighs any benefits of natural immunity. Once infected, there is no way to know how COVID -19 will affect an individual. Anyone can get sick with COVID -19 and become seriously ill. Adults aged 60 yrs+, and adults with underlying medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID -19. Severe illness from COVID -19 can result in hospitalization, admission to intensive care, intubation or mechanical ventilation, or death. Getting sick from COVID -19 could spread the virus to friends, family and others. Some patients can have symptoms that last for weeks or months after recovery from illness. People who had mild illness can experience persistent, late symptoms and/or less common serious long-term complications including: heart and lung problems, kidney injury, rash, hair loss, smell and taste problems, sleep issues, difficulty with concentration, memory problems, depression, anxiety, changes in mood. 19 CLICK HERE TO RETURN TO RISKS AND BENEFITS US CDC, 2021.

She is in your office for her routine diabetes 2 visit. At the end of the visit, you shift the conversation to the COVID -19 vaccine. Kasia says, \"I know about the COVID -19 vaccine but I'm not sure if I should get it. I've heard the side -effects are worse than the disease, but I am also worried about getting COVID.\" 1. Conversation challenge -the fence sitter 47Role play activity conversation challenge #1 3-5 minutes for role playing, 5 minutes for discussion in groups of 2 or more In small groups, perform a role play between two members of the group. One person act as the HW, who is applying the principles of risk communication and motivational interviewing. The other person act as the \"fence sitter\" patient described on the previous slide. Others can be observers and provide feedback after the role play. After completing the role play, read the following example conversation and discuss as a group the responses in the role play. Health Worker (HW): Kasia I want to let you know some great news, you are eligible for the COVID - 19 vaccine today. (Use a presumptive statement , assuming Kasia will get the COVID -19 vaccine today) Kasia: I know about the COVID -19 vaccine but I'm not sure if I should get it. I've heard the side-effects are worse than the disease, but I am also worried about getting COVID. 48HW recognizes Kasia is signaling uncertainty about the vaccine. She has concerns about the vaccine side -effects yet she is not refusing the vaccine. HW determines Kasia is Vaccine Hesitant. HW: Okay, we can talk about this. Tell me what you have heard about the vaccine side -effects? (An open -ended question, tailored to the patient's concern ) Kasia: Well, I know that vaccines protect us but I'm not sure about this one. I've read a lot on the internet about terrible side -effects from the COVID -19 vaccine, like allergic reactions. I'm worried about getting sick from the vaccine or having a bad reaction my body won't be able to handle. HW: You sound quite worried (empathic response ). As you said, the vaccine protects us against the virus. It sounds like you want to make the best choice for your health, but you are worried about the side -effects. (Reflective listening and acknowledgment of Kasia's concern ). It's very good that you are thinking about what's best for your health and looking for information about the vaccine. (Affirm and encourage strengths) .If it's okay with you, I could give you some additional information. (Elicit) Kasia: Sure! I want to know what I am risking. HW: Yes! You should definitely be aware of risks. (Affirmation )As with all medicines, side -effects can occur after getting a COVID -19 vaccine. The main side -effects of this vaccine are pain at the site of the injection, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, fever and chills. However, these mild side-effects subside after 24 -72 hours. Serious side -effects like an allergic reaction are extremely rare. The rates of severe allergic reactions following this vaccine are very low. A recent safety study reported a rate of around 1 in 200,000 with this vaccine. To guard against those unlikely events, people who receive these vaccines are asked to remain under observation for 15 -30 minutes after the injection so that trained medical staff are on hand to help in the rare case you experience a severe allergic reaction. (Share) The fact is: The risk of contracting COVID -19 and experiencing severe illness or serious complications, by far outweighs the risks of the COVID -19 vaccine. That's why I strongly recommend for you to get vaccinated today . Does this help to clarify what you are risking? (Verify) Kasia: Well... it does help to know what to expect. Thank you for taking the time to understand my concerns. 49HW: I'm happy to help. Given our discussion on the side -effects of the vaccine what do you think you want to do? (Summarize and decide action) 50Communication Strategy Response 1.Is Alex a good candidate for the vaccine?Yes, due to Alex's age and risk factors for cardiovascular disease and/or respiratory condition. 2.Use a presumptive approach\"Alex, the letter was correct, in fact, you can get your vaccine today.\" 3.Identify Alex on the Vaccine Acceptance ContinuumDistrusts the safety of the vaccine but not refusing = Hesitant 4.Ask an open -ended question \"What do you know about the safety of the vaccine?\" 5.Reflect and acknowledge his concerns\"I understand you feel like the vaccine was rushed, and you are right it was developed fast...\" 6.Affirm and encourage strengths. \"Its great that you voice your concern, and you are thinking about safety issues.\" 7.Elicit-share -verify. \"If you agree, I could share with you some information about the vaccine development and explain why I recommend this vaccine for you.\" 8.Summarize and decide action\"We have discussed the safety of the vaccine today and why I think it is important for your health, what would you like to do?\"Alex is a 76 y/o male who regularly experiences shortness of breath. He is visiting the nurse for a blood pressure check. He lets the nurse know he received a letter from the clinic recommending he book a time for the COVID -19 vaccine. Alex says, \"I don't know if I trust the vaccine, I'm worried that it was rushed out too quickly and I can't be sure that it's safe.\" 2. Conversation challenge -the doubter51Role play activity conversation challenge #2 3-5 minutes for role playing, 5 minutes for discussion in groups of 2 or more In small groups, perform a role play between two members of the group. One person act as the HW, who is applying the principles of risk communication and motivational interviewing. The other person act as the \"doubter\" patient described on the previous slide. Others can be observers and provide feedback after the role play. After completing the role play, read the following example conversation and discuss as a group the responses in the role play. Alex: I got this letter from the clinic to say I should book an appointment for the COVID -19 vaccine. HW: Alex, the letter was correct, and in fact, you can get your COVID -19 vaccine today. (Presumptive statement) Alex: I don't know if I trust the vaccine, I'm worried that it was rushed too quickly and I can't be sure that it's safe. This vaccine makes me nervous, I don't know if it's been fully tested... Maybe they skipped some steps. You know these companies just want to make money. HW: I can hear that you are worried. Tell me, what have you heard about the vaccine development that makes you uncertain about its safety? (An open -ended question, tailored to the patient's concern) HW recognizes Alex is signaling uncertainty about the vaccine. He distrusts the saftey of the vaccine but not yet showing signs of refusal. The nurse determines Alex is Vaccine Hesitant. Alex: Well, I've been talking to my family and friends. A lot of people are worried about the vaccine being too rushed. I read that vaccines take years to develop but this one only took months, so I just don't know if corners were cut and whether it's reall y safe. HW: If I understood you correctly, you're worried about this vaccine because it's new and was developed quickly in comparison to other vaccines. (Reflective listening) Alex: Yes that's right. I don't want to be a lab rat. HW: I can understand your worry (Acknowledging patient). I think it's important that you voice your concern, and you are thinking about safety issues. (Affirm and encourage strengths). If you agree, I could share with you some additional information about the vaccine development and explain why I recommend this vaccine for you . (Elicit) Alex: well, okay sure.. 52HW: You are right that the vaccine was developed quite fast in comparison to other vaccines. (Acknowledging patient) Because of the high risk from COVID -19 and rapid infection rates around the globe, the clinical trials have proceeded faster tha n has been possible with other vaccines. This is because many tens of thousands of people quickly signed up to participate in vacci ne trials, compared to the more usual 12 to 18 months it takes to recruit a fraction of that for other vaccines. In the case of COVID -19, a lot of resources, including worldwide scientists and investments were rapidly put toward the development of a vaccine. All vaccines have to go through pre -clinical and three phases of clinical trials. The testing processes for the vaccines didn't skip any steps, inste ad vaccine developers conducted some stages of the process simultaneously to gather as much data as quickly as possible. (Share) For the COVID -19 vaccines regulatory bodies set up rigorous standards of safety, quality and effectives that must be met before a vaccine could be authorized for use. So far, none of the vaccine trials have reported any serious safety concerns. Once vacci nesare authorized for use, safety data are continuously monitored by national authorities and the WHO. (Share) Does this new information help to clarify things for you? (Verify) Alex: Well, it helps to know this background. But what about the vaccine side -effects? HW: Yes, it is important you are informed (Build rapport and trust). In terms of side -effects, you might expect mild ones such as a sore arm, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, fever and chills. Most importantly you will also have protection against COVID -19. I can highly recommend this vaccine to protect your health. Without vaccine protection you are vulnerable to a severe infection that could put you in the hospital. I can confidently say to you the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks.(Strong recommendation) (Pause for reflection) Do you have more questions about the vaccine you would like to discuss? (Verify) Alex: No, I think it's a bit clearer now. HW: So Alex, given our discussion on the vaccine's safety would you be willing to have it now? (Summarize and decide action) 5354Communication Strategy Response 1.Is Eva a good candidate for the vaccine?Yes.

She is in your office complaining of back pain. You use the opportunity to offer the COVID -19 vaccine. Eva says, \"no way never! I don't believe in vaccines they can make you sick, besides I was already sick with COVID last year, so I have natural protection.\" 3. Conversation challenge -the opponent55Role play activity conversation challenge #3 3-5 minutes for role playing, 5 minutes for discussion in groups of 2 or more In small groups, perform a role play between two members of the group. One person act as the HW, who is applying the principles of risk communication and motivational interviewing. The other person act as the \"opponent\" patient described on the previous slide. Others can be observers and provide feedback after the role play. After completing the role play, read the following example conversation and discuss as a group the responses in the role play. HW: Eva, your work in a long -term care home is extremely vital in these pandemic times. You are considered an essential worker. As you are well aware, long -term care settings are prone to infection outbreaks, therefore it is very important for you to safeguard your health so you can continue your important work. I have some good news, you are eligible for the COVID -19 vaccine today, (Presumptive statement) this will provide you with an increased measure of protection. Eva: No way! I don't believe in vaccines. And besides I was already sick with COVID last year, so I have natural protection. HW recognizes Eva is signaling she never vaccinates and prefers natural immunity. She may hold a philosophical position on vaccination causing her to believe vaccines are unsafe = Refuses All. HW: Eva, I would like to understand your decision, can you tell me more about why you don't believe in the vaccine? (Do not debate or correct misinformation. Explore concern) Eva: I've read plenty on the internet about how vaccines can make you sick. That's why I never take the flu shot. Anyway, I just think natural protection is better for me. HW: I see you have done a lot of thinking about this and I can understand you are concerned about vaccines. (Acknowledging) If it's okay with you, I'd like to share with you my view. (Share knowledge with permission) Eva: Sure..... but I can tell you I'm not getting the vaccine today. 56HW: That's okay. You are right that a previous infection with COVID -19 produces antibodies in your system providing protection against infection. However, experts do not yet know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID -19. Natural immunity also varies from person to person. I can assure you that the COVID -19 vaccine we use is the best way to prevent you from getting sick again. It is very safe and serious side -effects are rare. In fact, safety data is being continuously monitored by experts, when a concern comes up, new research is done to check whether the results are consistent or not. (Share) Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID -19 and the fact that reinfection with COVID -19 is possible, I strongly recommend to vaccinate regardless of whether you already have been sick with COVID -19. (Give your strong recommendation) Especially because you are at a high risk for contracting COVID -19 at your workplace. I would like to share with you this COVID -19 vaccine decision aid to take home with you. It can help you weigh the risks of the vaccine and the disease. (Share credible resources tailored to patient's concern) Eva: I guess I could take a look at it, but I'm still feeling pretty cautious. HW: I understand that you have decided not to vaccinate today. Please know you are taking an important responsibility. What this means is that if you experience any of these signs and symptoms, you should seek medical attention. (Offer print information about signs and symptoms of COVID -19 infection) You can help to protect yourself and others by performing frequent handwashing and wearing a mask covering your mouth and nose, however, be aware there is still a risk of reinfection. (Inform about risks and responsibilities of vaccine refusal) You are welcome back to the clinic any time if you have questions or have a change of mind. (Leave the door open for further discussion.) Eva: Okay thanks 5758Communication Strategy Response 1.Is Maria a good candidate for the vaccine?

I am worried about getting COVID and I really want to see my grandchildren again.\" 4. Conversation challenge -go along to get along59Role play activity conversation challenge #4 3-5 minutes for role playing, 5 minutes for discussion in groups of 2 or more In small groups, perform a role play between two members of the group. One person act as the HW, who is applying the principles of risk communication and motivational interviewing. The other person act as the \"go along to get along\" patient described on the previous slide. Others can be observers and provide feedback after the role play. After completing the role play, read the following example conversation and discuss as a group the responses in the role play. HW: Hello Maria, I understand that you would like to get your COVID -19 vaccine today. Maria: Yes that's right, I am worried about getting COVID and I really want to see my grandchildren again... Maria is asking for the COVID -19 vaccine and shows signs of motivation = Acceptor HW: I can understand your worry (Building rapport ). It's great to hear you are ready for the vaccine. (Encouragement ) First, we want to make sure it will be safe for you to receive the vaccine. Have you completed the pre -vaccination check list? This will help us determine if there is any reason you should not get the COVID -19 vaccine today. (Ask about contraindications and precautions) Maria: Yes, here it is HW: Great! I can see that you are in fact eligible for the COVID -19 vaccine. Do you have questions before I administer the vaccine? (Ask if there are questions) Maria: Yes, I would like to know if it is painful? HW: That's a great question. Let's take a moment to review the possible side -effects of the vaccine and what you can do for relief. The COVID -19 vaccine is given through an injection into your shoulder. You may feel a slight pinch when the needle goes in. Afterwards, we want you to stay here for 15 minutes to be sure you don't have any allergic reactions. (Explain the process) In terms of some of the common side -effects, you might have some pain and swelling at the injection site, or you might have a mild fever and body aches. It's important to remember these s ide-effects indicate your body is responding well to the vaccine. These usually improve within a few days after vaccination, but if for some reason they last longer I want you to contact the clinic. To reduce pain, you can apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area. If you experience a fever, make sure to drink plenty of fluids. (Share knowledge: alert on side -effects and pain mitigation). A 2nddose will be required in 3 -4 weeks. The first dose starts building protection, however a 2nddose is necessary to get the most protection the vaccine can offer. (Explain the process) Maria: Okay thanks for the information 60HW: Okay, so let us go ahead with the vaccine now. Maria: Thank you! Sounds good. HW vaccinates Maria. Congratulations, you've taken a significant step to protect your health. (Vaccinate and congratulate) So we don't forget, let's book another appointment in 3 to 4 weeks from now for your next dose. You will be contacted with a reminder close to the date. (Book appointment for 2nd dose and send reminder) HW: Maria I want to let you know, it takes time for the body to build protection after any vaccination. COVID -19 vaccines requiring 2 doses may not protect you until 1 -2 weeks after the 2nd dose. Therefore it is very important to continue with all measures to protect yourself and others including, wearing a mask to cover your mouth and nose outside of your home, take 1 meter physical distance from others, perform frequent handwashing and try to avoid crowded, closed and close contact spaces. (Review post -vaccination steps) Maria: Good to know! HW: Well it was great to see you today and we will see you soon again for your next dose. I will show you where you can wait while you will be monitored for 15 minutes. (Post - vaccination steps) Maria: Thank you 61Conversation considerations Actively listen to understand patients' concerns, frame vaccination in a way that matters to them.Use facts sparingly -too many can confuse.Avoid jargon Use language and content that fit the patient.Stories can be powerful and compelling -especially if personal. Frame data clearly and positively. (e.g. better to say \"99% safe\" rather than \"1% risk\" of side - effects).Respect the patient's informed decision.Be non - judgemental and non - confrontational .Build Trust 6263Keep in mind... The long -term goal of these conversations is to move the patient towards a \"yes\" for acceptance. This may take more than one visit. The short -term goal may be to win their confidence. Conversations that guide the patient to explore their reasons for hesitancy can help increase confidence and trust in the COVID -19 vaccine. Adequate training and practice can help lead to positive outcomes. Recheck intentions to vaccinate Summarize concerns; Decide action : Share expert information; offer referral to a specialist service or community advocate; schedule follow -up for a new discussion.Hesitant Initiate a conversation guided by MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING techniques: 1.Ask open -ended questions -explore main reasons behind hesitancy. 2.Reflect and acknowledge concerns -repeat what the patient says or what you think the patient means to reflect the cause(s) of hesitancy. 3.Affirm strengths and provide encouragement -recognize strengths to identify common goals. 4.Elicit, share knowledge, verify -ask what patient knows and seek to complete their knowledge, share evidence tailored to concern, verify understanding. Strongly recommend vaccination and explain why.Accept Ask about contraindications and precautions. Ask if there are questions. Share knowledge: Alert on side -effects Pain mitigation Explain the process.Refuse Do not dismiss, acknowledge. Not a debate -explore concerns. Share knowledge with permission. Give your strong recommendation. Share expert information; offer referral to a specialist service or community advocate (if available). Inform about risks of vaccine refusal.

Reminding your patients: The goal is for everyone to have easy access to COVID -19 vaccination as soon as larger quantities are available. 2. Providing patients with resources about the vaccines and actions they can take before they get vaccinated, such as: 70Messaging to patients when COVID -19 vaccine supply is limited Regardless of vaccine availability: HWs can start conversations early and proactively recommend the vaccine to all adult patients. Guidance adapted from the US CDC. 2021. Essential Workers COVID -19 Vaccine ToolkitPromote vaccination within your social network by sharing accurate and timely information about COVID -19 vaccines.Learn about the COVID -19 vaccines plans in your community or through your national public health authority and make a vaccination plan for yourself or family members for when vaccine is offered.Continue to take recommended actions to protect yourself and others from COVID -19.Learn about the COVID -19 vaccines and their benefits and follow -up with your health provider if you have questions.Promote vaccine acceptance by advising patients what to expect and how to behave: 71We don't know yet how much protection the vaccine will provide, so continue using all the measures to protect yourself and others (mask covering mouth and nose + 1 meter social distance + frequent handwashing, avoid crowded, closed, close contact spaces).Messaging to patients about what happens after the vaccine Expect some Side-effects. Patients need 2 doses of the vaccine for longer lasting protection.* It takes time for the body to build protection after any vaccination. COVID -19 vaccines requiring 2 doses may not protect you until 1 -2 weeks after the 2nd dose. No vaccine is 100% effective. Some people may still get COVID -19 despite having a vaccination, but this infection should be less severe.Report any ongoing troubling side -effects to health worker . * Dependant on the vaccine used in HW's clinical practiceWhen considering vaccine information on the Internet, advise your patients: 1.Check that the information comes from a credible source (i.erelevant expertise) 2. Prioritize established/trusted institutions . Look for sources that are known for their credibility (e.g. International Organizations, Ministry of Health, academic institutions). 3.Check the date, ensure information is current and verify information is updated on a regular basis. 4. Avoid commercial sites. 5.
