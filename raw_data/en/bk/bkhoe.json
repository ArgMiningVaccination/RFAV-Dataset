Based on my understanding of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and other federal and state laws, I choose to exercise my right to demand a religious exemption to the requirement that I be vaccinated using the Covid-19 shots. This demand for an exemption is based on my deeply held religious beliefs pursuant to my reliance on teachings in the Holy Bible. The Bible says, \"Therefore to him who knows to do good, and does not do it, to him it is sin\" (James 4:17 NKJV). My personal convictions are inspired by my study and understanding of the Bible, and personally directed by the true and living God. I am personally convicted that I should not receive any of the Covid-19 shots presently authorized by the FDA. It is not my responsibility to force my personal religious convictions regarding this matter on other persons as I believe whether to receive a Covid-19 shot is a personal decision to each person (Romans 14). Where scripture does not expressly instruct on a particular matter, I believe that I am required to search the Scripture myself for related truths (Romans 15:4) and to seek personal guidance from the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38-39; Romans 8). If I fail to submit to the personal convictions that the Holy Spirit and Scripture has impressed upon me, I will be sinning against God. I have personally searched the Scripture and sought guidance from the Holy Spirit to come to my decision. The Bible very clearly states that the body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit. We are commanded to take good care of it, not to defile it, and certainly not introduce something into it that could potentially harm it (1 Corinthians 3:16-17, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20, 2 Corinthians 5:10, and 2 Corinthians 7:1). The Bible also outlines the fact that God created the body both \"fearfully and wonderfully.\" (Psalm 139:13-16). The Covid-19 shots work as gene therapy. By manipulating genetic operations, the Covid-19 shots alter what God made (literally assuming the position of God), which I believe to be a sinful practice under these circumstances. These vaccines (by the very disclosure of the vaccine manufacturers) contain carcinogens, neurotoxins, animal viruses, animal blood, allergens, and heavy metals. I do not believe it would be right for me to introduce these substances into my body because they have not sufficiently been proven to me to be safe and effective. Rather, I believe they may be harmful to my body. Perhaps the most notably significant reason why the acceptance of these vaccines would be considered sinful centers around the fact that fetal stem cell lines from aborted babies were used in either the initial development and/or testing of the Covid-19 shots. By receiving the Covid-19 shots presently available, I believe it would constitute a complicit action in the act of abortion. I believe that abortion is murder and is strictly prohibited in the Bible (Exodus 20:13; Psalm 139:13-16; Jeremiah 1:5; Isaiah 49:15). Psalm 127:3 says that \"Children are a heritage from the LORD, offspring a reward from him.\" The fact that aborted stem cells were involved in the origination of the three Covid-19 shots make the consumption of this vaccine an unthinkable act to me. In addition to the religious exemption demanded, I have the legal right to be exempted from the vaccine mandate based on Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Additionally, the Constitution grants and protects every American citizen the God-given right to make my own medical decisions. The Declaration of Independence recognizes rights are God-given. God commands me to glorify Him with my body \u2014 and not give it to the government. First, the Ninth Amendment states, \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\" The Constitution does not grant the power or authority to the federal government to compel private citizens take medical treatments \u2014 especially not as a category. Therefore, I reserve this right. Second, federal laws protects my choosing to disclose private medical decisions (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). Numerous legal and financial penalties exist for entities violating this law. Mandating vaccination as a condition of employment implies I disclose medical information and is a violation of federal law \u2014 as well as workplace discrimination. This mandated vaccine is, to me, contrary to Biblical teachings, my faith in Jesus Christ, the specific powers granted the federal government, and existing federal law. It is unlawful to segregate people according to their skin color. It is unlawful to compel Jews to eat pork. It is also unlawful to compel personal medical decisions of citizens. My religious beliefs are sincere. Legally, I cannot be required to prove that a church or religious leader agrees with my sincere religious beliefs, or my interpretation of Scripture, or my instruction from the Holy Spirit. My beliefs are my own, and they are sincerely and deeply held. "}
