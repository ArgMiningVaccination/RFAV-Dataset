Recommended Reviews [Learn more about reviews.](https://www.yelp.com/reviews-trust-link-tree?l=en_US) Overall rating 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star - 8/7/2023 After some extensive traveling abroad, I had lived for years with chronic GI issues; I unsuccessfully saw both a gastroenterologist at UCSD as well as another naturopathic doctor before I was referred to Dr. Noel. Each session, Dr. Noel listens intently and takes time to gain a thorough understanding of my symptoms in order to craft a health plan specific to my needs. While the process has been lengthy, I can finally say that my stomach has healed and that I am back to normal - I am incredibly grateful to have found Shine and cannot recommend them enough to anyone in the San Diego area. - 4/22/2023 Dr Noel has been awesome; listens, make suggestions and orders appropriate lab work. She thoroughly explains results and writes a plan of care. Expect to pay for non covered services. Only wish a person answers the phone but they do return the call. - 12/19/2022 So grateful for Dr Lo who helped me identify and heal my leaky gut in just 6 months, which helped reduce bloating and helped my mood and energy. Additionally, we were able to help heal my back injury by addressing my high inflammation markers with nutrition and supplementation. I feel like I have my life back. Thank you, Dr Lo and team!! - 11/3/2022 An absolute trash of a human being running this business! She makes comments on instagram that are hateful, hurtful and down right wrong. - 9/29/2022 I fully believe in the holistic approach to medicine and have been in Dr. Noel's care for years now. She was able to identify a diagnosis that other doctors missed, and has recommended lifestyle and nutritional changes as well as supplements that have caused me to see major improvements in the way I feel. I am so glad I stuck with her care plan, as I know it will have lasting benefits to my life! - 5/17/2022 I saw Dr Noel and she did not help me one bit with my ongoing SIBO issues. She is out of network and I had to pay everything out of pocket (which I knew) but stuck it out because I was hopeful she was going to be a good fit. She wasn't. I was very vulnerable due to my ongoing stomach issues and she knew that. We had a virtual visit to go over blood work but no \"game plan\" on how to eradicate my SIBO so I can get my life back and feel better. She just added vitamins to FullScript and sold me on these \"IV injections\". They recommended to me that I do these injections because I was \"low in vitamins\" (not sure what these had to do with me having SIBO). She didn't explain why she recommended these injections nor did her or her office send me a diagram on HOW to inject these by myself at home. I ended up calling to ask many questions (lesson learned: ask questions before you agree to do anything in the medical world). I live in Pasadena so they sent them to me via UPS. Absolute no follow up after I had to inject myself with a 4 inch syringe once a week (I could have had an allergic reaction or god forbid, dead). My legs were bruised because they hurt so badly. After four weeks, silence from Dr Noel and her office AND I still have ongoing terrible stomach issues. Super disappointing in her \"care\". I felt like they forgot about me and I'm just another patient who's paying out of pocket and that's so defeating when you're in pain searching for answers. When we're in pain, we will do anything to feel better. Definitely not worth my time and money and yours either. Tons of other gastro doctors/Naturopaths that will take their time with you and help you from start to finish with follow through and impeccable communication. BEWARE!!!! - 8/5/2020 I've come here for iron IVs and blood testing, so has my mom. Francesca Medina is a genuine doctor that exudes love and passion about the work she does. - 9/23/2019 I love Shine, and the doctors and staff there! My husband and I had appointments with Dr. Noel several times between 2017-2018. She's truly an expert in natural health, nutrition and supplementation. I believe she's partly to thank for bringing my health to an optimal level pre-pregnancy. I went on to have a very healthy pregnancy and baby boy! It's amazing to see the test results and find out your micronutrient levels, hormone levels, allergies (including food allergies I had no idea I had), and more... The type and extent of testing they offer there is hard to find elsewhere. I trust the knowledge, expertise and opinions of these naturopathic doctors. I believe much more in the work she's doing than in conventional medicine at this point-- Dr. Noel, Dr. Meg and others at Shine look at root and underlying causes, figure out what's going on and guide the patient to better health and wellness. Conventional doctors more often slap a band-aid (usually pharmaceutical drugs) on whatever the problem is, ultimately leading to side effects & more problems. The main downside for us was-- as many others have mentioned-- some very steep prices for appointments, supplements, testing, etc. That is the only reason we haven't been back for the last year or so-- it's unfortunately cost-prohibitive for us at this time. I do wish that natural health care were more affordable for all-- I would send my family & friends here if I could. However, for those who can afford it, I highly recommend Shine, Dr. Noel, Dr. Meg and the others there. They are great doctors and they know their stuff. Bekah, their clinic director, is a light and a joy to interact with, too! - 3/15/2019Updated review Really bad service. Very expensive and not worth the money to be honest. I had a 2 pm appointment . It was 2:25 and still waiting to be seen . Ended up leaving . Very unprofessional .10/3/2018Previous review Although it's a very clean and unique place the prices are too high and I have had to wait for over 20 minutes twice now for the dr to see me . I never got my diet routine done either and this was the number one thing on my list . To improve my eating habits and after spending almos 1000 usd in 2 sessions I did not have that done . Not really worth it if you ask me .8/15/2018Previous review Dr Meagan is very sweet and helped me out with a healthy diet to get more energy . The place is very clean and all the staff is very friendly and helps out with any questions you may have . - 12/25/2017 I have a long two year health history and was going to Shine just for IV's. I had never had luck with any doctors or naturopathic doctors after seeing many. I started to give up because I was chronically declining. No doctors were treating the actual root cause and I knew there was something wrong. After a few months of IV's I scheduled an appointment and I've never been so grateful for a doctor in my life. She ran real comprehensive testing and actually figured out a majority of my issues. Parasites, lack of nutrient absorption and more. Save your money, skip the other places and start with Dr. Meg, if you have health issues. Dr. Meg is the best of the best! Better than any Sharp, Scripps, UCSD Doctor (by a long shot) and she also is painless at drawing blood.
