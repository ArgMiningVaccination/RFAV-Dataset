Schleich, PhD President of NCNM Greetings from the Office of the President2014-2015 Catalog | Letter from the Provost 3 Dear Prospective Student of NCNM, Our academic programs honor the art and the science of natural medicine. We are dedicated to natural medicine education and research that are innovative and effective, honoring timeless wisdom that remains a universal resource for serving the needs of present and future patients. Your exploration into the field of natural medicine comes at an auspicious time, as there is a rapidly increasing recognition that natural medicine is a critical component of any healthcare system focused on true healing. NCNM's School of Naturopathic Medicine confers the oldest Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) degree in North America. Naturopathic physicians are trained to be primary care physicians, combining the use of evidence-based medicine with the wisdom of traditional healing arts. Our naturopathic medical school education includes not only natural modalities, but also conventional therapeutics in a very challenging and rewarding program. Core to naturopathic medicine is the understanding that the human body is capable of healing itself if given the right tools that resonate with nature. The naturopathic program at NCNM teaches students to assess a whole person, not separate disease processes, and to treat that whole person to achieve balance and optimum. Our School of Classical Chinese Medicine (CCM) attracts faculty and students who are passionate about reconnecting with the ancient roots of this powerful system of medicine. The process emphasizes lineage-based teaching methods, and is an inspiring confluence of scholarly and hands-on endeavors aimed at the achievement of optimal clinical outcomes. Our Master of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM) program provides comprehensive, world-class training in acupuncture, moxibustion, Chinese herbal formulation, Asian bodywork, cultivation practices (including qigong and taiji), and Asian dietetics. Students also receive a solid foundation in biomedicine, and learn both how to integrate Western scientific knowledge into the ancient whole-systems approach, and how to interface effectively with the larger healthcare community. The program produces graduates firmly on the path of becoming what the classical texts of the medicine refer to as \"high-level practitioners\"\u2014successful clinicians capable of diagnosing and treating any disease state or health condition. Our School of Research & Graduate Studies offers three degree programs, which cater to multiple career paths. Many students choose to pursue degrees within this school concurrently with a degree from the Schools of Naturopathic or Classical Chinese Medicine. The Master of Science in Integrative Medicine Research (MSiMR) program trains evidence-based clinicians, clinician researchers and master's level researchers. This unique program combines course subjects from the standard Master of Public Health (MPH) and Master of Clinical Research (MCR) programs with a strong literary and scientific base in integrative medicine research. The MSiMR program's active learning approach builds applied, basic and clinical research skills. Student research is pursued through our Helfgott Research Institute, which is dedicated to rigorous, high-quality research on the art and science of healing. The research completed by NCNM's faculty and students further establishes the evidence base for natural medicine. The Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN) program is designed to train students in master's level, evidence-based nutrition and is created for those interested in a strong foundation in whole-food nutrition and using food as medicine. As the U.S. population struggles with obesity, Alzheimer's disease, chronic pain, heart disease, and other maladies that have nutritional components, the demand for people with expertise in nutrition has increased. The role of nutrition in health and medicine has never been more evident and, increasingly, nutrition experts are a part of integrative medicine care teams. NCNM's newest degree program is the Master of Science in Global Health (MScGH). This program offers a whole-systems approach to global health wherein students are trained to view a broader context of health and medicine rooted in integrative medicine. They are encouraged to explore multi-disciplinary solutions to complex health issues. A public health curriculum establishes the base of this degree, with additional emphasis in health disparities and social justice. Skills learned in this program can be applied locally or internationally. Fieldwork allows students to hone their skills with current challenges in public and global health. We are excited about what our community offers to serve the healthcare needs of humanity and welcome all who are interested in joining us! We look forward to meeting you. Andrea Smith, EdD, on behalf of the NCNM Academic Team Provost/Vice-President of Academic Affairs Greetings from the Provost and Deans Clockwise from top left: Catherine Downey, Cheryl Miller, Melanie Henriksen, Leslie Fuller, Heather Zwickey, Andrea Smith, Laurie Regan, Kenneth Glowacki (Not pictured: Carrie Baldwin-Sayre)The Profession's College | ncnm.edu 4 NCNM is proud of its longstanding legacy of academic excellence. Founded in 1956, NCNM is the oldest college of naturopathic medicine in North America. NCNM continues its vision of innovation and leadership by offering superior education and training in natural medicine, research, and more to new generations of practitioners and healthcare experts. NCNM offers five exceptional accredited degree programs\u2014Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND); Master of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM); Master of Science in Integrative Medicine Research (MSiMR); Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN); and the college's newest program, Master of Science in Global Health (MScGH). In addition to the NCNM Clinic, the largest natural medicine clinic in Oregon, the college has access to more than a dozen local clinics offering diverse clinical experiences to students. NCNM is home to a collaborative and inspiring learning environment, as well as a vital and groundbreaking research community. Our campus, located in the heart of Portland, Oregon, offers students and faculty the benefits and advantages of city living at its most sustainable within an urban setting infused with natural beauty, culture and social conscience.NCNM is an international leader in the training of naturopathic physicians and Chinese medicine practitioners. While many graduates go on to clinical practice, they are also researchers, professors and political activists bringing natural medicine to the forefront of the national healthcare system. Students from around the globe come to NCNM for the opportunity to work with a faculty world-renowned for their expertise in natural medicine. NCNM cultivates exceptional curricula that offer medical students a rich combination of classroom study, hands-on research and patient care. Health awareness is growing significantly and natural medicine is on the rise. Studies have shown that Americans are seeking more natural health products, alternatives and services than ever before. Natural medicine provides patients a wide variety of beneficial treatment options unavailable to conventional medical practitioners. It is a rapidly growing and evolving field that is serving the escalating need for effective preventive health care for millions of Americans. NCNM\u2014The Profession's College Natural Medicine Today Natural medicine is known by many names: alternative medicine, integrative medicine, complementary medicine and others. One reason for its many labels is that natural medicine includes a variety of healing modalities. Your education at NCNM may include some or all of the following therapeutic methods, depending on your course of study. Traditional medical systems such as naturopathic medicine, Chinese medicine, homeopathy and acupuncture Mind-body medicine Physical medicine, including hydrotherapy and naturopathic manipulation Botanical medicine and supplements Nutrition counseling Conventional therapies including pharmaceuticals and minor surgeryEach of these modalities present a tool for the physician to gain a better understanding of patient diagnosis and treatment for health conditions ranging from minor ailments to chronic and acute care. When these modalities are used in conjunction with conventional medicine, they are called complementary medicine. When used as a substitute for conventional medicine, the same modalities may be called alternative medicine. When a conventional physician and a naturopathic physician work together to create the best healing plan for the patient, it's called integrative medicine. As more people seek combination treatments, future natural medicine practitioners and physicians will need to be knowledgeable about both conventional and natural medicine. Our graduates are able to bridge this gap. 2014-2015 Catalog | Academic Calendar 5 Summer quarter begins 6/30/2014 New student orientation, MScN summer admits only 7/2/2014 July 4 holiday (campus & clinics closed) 7/4/2014 Summer academic classes begin 7/7/2014 Summer academic classes end 8/29/2014 Labor Day holiday (campus & clinics closed) 9/1/2014 New student orientation 9/10-12/2014 Convocation 9/12/2014Summer quarter ends 9/13/2014 Fall quarter begins 9/15/2014 Last day to add or change sections 9/26/2014 Last day to pay tuition & fees 9/26/2014 Last day to waive out of Clinic Benefit Plan 9/26/2014 Late payment fee assessed 9/29/2014 Last day to drop classes 10/24/2014 Veterans Day (campus & clinics closed) 11/11/2014 Clinic holiday I 11/24-26/2014 Thanksgiving break (no academic classes) 11/24-26/2014 Thanksgiving holiday (campus & clinics closed) 11/27-29/2014 Make up Veterans Day 12/2/2014 Practical exam/makeup week 12/1, 3-5/2014 Finals week 12/8-12/2014 Mid-year graduate celebration 12/12/2014 Fall quarter ends 12/13/2014 Winter break (no academic classes) 12/15/2014-1/4/2015 Clinic holiday II 12/15-20/2014 Clinic open limited hours (no student shifts) 12/22-23/2014 Winter break (campus closed) 12/22-27/2014 Clinics closed 12/24-27/2014 Clinic holiday III 12/29/2014-1/3/2015 New Year's Day (campus & clinics closed) 1/1/2015 Orientation, January admits 1/2/2015 Winter quarter begins 1/5/2015 Last day to add or change sections 1/16/2015 Last day to pay tuition & fees 1/16/2015 Last day to opt-in or out of Clinic Benefit Plan 1/16/2015 Martin Luther King Day (campus & clinics closed) 1/19/2015 Late payment fee assessed 1/20/2015 GPA 2 & 3 exams 1/23-24/2015 Last day to drop classes 2/13/2015 Make up Martin Luther King Day 3/16/2015 Practical exam/makeup week 3/16-20/2015 Finals week 3/23-27/2015 Last day to petition to participate in commencement 3/27/2015 Winter quarter ends 3/28/2015 Spring break (no academic classes) 3/30-4/4/2015 Clinic holiday IV 3/30-4/4/2015 Spring quarter begins 4/6/2015 College Council 4/17/2015 Last day to add or change sections 4/17/2015 Last day to pay tuition & fees 4/17/2015 Last day to opt-in or out of Clinic Benefit Plan 4/17/2015 Late payment fee assessed 4/21/2015 GPA1 exams 4/24-25/2015 Last day to drop classes 5/15/2015 Memorial Day (campus & clinics closed) 5/25/2015 Make up Memorial Day 6/15/2015 Practical exam/makeup week 6/16-19/2015 Finals week 6/22-26/2015 Spring quarter 6/27/2015 Commencement 6/28/2015Academic Calendar 2014-2015Campus | ncnm.edu 6 NCNM Campus Situated in the beautiful Pacific Northwest city of Portland, Oregon, National College of Natural Medicine is located near the Willamette River waterfront, close to the heart of the city.

Scientific Research at NCNM Naturopathic and Chinese medical research is vital to providing a body of evidence-based data to support the practice of natural medicine. NCNM is committed to fully integrating research with existing academic and clinical activities. NCNM faculty members are currently participating in National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) grants from the National Institutes of Health, including collaborations with Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) and other biomedical schools or accredited natural medicine schools. While not all physicians and practitioners wish to become researchers, our goal is to train all of our graduates in the critical analysis of research studies so that they may accurately evaluate the quality of medical literature. In addition, learning about case analysis enables graduates to clearly investigate therapeutic results in their practices and share these results via publication in peer-reviewed journals. For those with an interest, there are many opportunities to participate in research at NCNM's Helfgott Research Institute. Helfgott Research Institute The Helfgott Research Institute conducts rigorous, high-quality research on the art and science of healing. From basic science studies to clinical trials, Helfgott scientists from the fields of naturopathic medicine, Chinese medicine, acupuncture, immunology, biostatistics and nutrition apply their expertise to seek out natural medicine therapies that are effective, to discover why they work, and to develop methodologies for studying modalities that may not fall into the traditional biomedical model of research. 2014-2015 Catalog | Campus 9 Established in June 2003, Helfgott has a state-of-the art basic science laboratory as well as institutional resources to carry out clinical research. Faculty and student research projects are published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. At Helfgott, we believe in collaborative research and make every effort to include conventional biomedical and other CAM institutions in our projects. Helfgott promotes a strong student research program. In addition to the Master of Science in Integrative Medicine Research program, students in NCNM's clinical programs and School of Research & Graduate Studies have opportunities to participate in research during their course of study. Women in Balance Institute The Women in Balance Institute (WIBI) at NCNM is the first natural medicine educational institution in the nation dedicated to education and research on women's hormone health. The institute's goal is to educate women and the healthcare community about hormone imbalance, and its impact on a woman's health and well-being as she ages. With the guidance of a lead physician, NCNM medical students participating in WIBI have the opportunity to play a role in women's health education and public speaking outreach. Food as Medicine Institute The goal of the Food as Medicine Institute (FAMI) is to convert the intensive nutrition training that naturopathic and Chinese medicine students receive during their medical education into meaningful opportunities for community members to receive hands-on experiences to learn about food as medicine. FAMI offers a variety of opportunities for NCNM students, under the guidance of naturopathic physicians, to be involved in community-based and corporate-wellness nutrition and cooking programs, including the FAME series (Food as Medicine Everyday). FAME offers a 12-week series on nutrition education and hands-on whole-foods cooking instruction to children, families and adults in the Portland area. Traditional Roots Institute The Traditional Roots Institute launched in spring 2013 with a simple goal: to feed and grow natural medicine's herbal roots. The institute helps bring the people's medicine back to the people through direct community education, and offers opportunities for healthcare providers of all types to deepen their understanding of herbal medicine and advance their clinical practice. With the guidance of a lead physician, NCNM students help lead herb walks, organize educational events, and write articles for the Traditional Roots website.

While at NCNM, students may undertake any two programs concurrently. Additionally, ND students in good academic standing are eligible to apply for admission into the Qigong and Shiatsu Certificate Programs. Due to space constraints, admission is limited. The certificates are not degree programs and do not lead to eligibility to sit for licensure exams. Contact the Office of Admissions for further information. There is no advantage to holding a BS rather than a BA degree, as long as you have completed the program's prerequisites. Credit will only be given for prerequisite coursework earning a \"C\" or better. Applicants may apply with coursework still in progress; however, the Office of Admissions must receive all official transcripts showing completed coursework prior to matriculation. For the purpose of prerequisites, the Office of Admissions defines a \"course\" as either a quarter or semester term. Age of Course Prerequisite courses not taken within seven years of matriculation into the program are subject to review. Additional coursework may be required. Application Process Applicants must submit the following required items to complete an application: Application Form: A file is created for the applicant once a complete application is received and accompanied by the application fee. $75 Application Fee: This fee is nonrefundable. Transcripts: Students are required to request and submit official sealed transcripts from each college and/or university attended, and have them sent directly to NCNM. Students who decide to enroll at NCNM must send an official copy from their undergraduate degree granting institution to the Office of Admissions before starting the program, as well as the official transcripts fulfilling all prerequisites. Essays: Applicants are required to submit essays to be considered for admissions. Essays should tell us about an applicant's background, abilities, interests and experiences, and how these will make them a good candidate for the programs at NCNM. Ideally, applicants should share some personal experiences and genuine thoughts in their essays. Explaining why you are applying to NCNM is also helpful. The Admissions Committee will look for writing ability, as well as content when reading the essay.

Letters of Recommendation: Applicants applying to the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine and Master of Science in Oriental Medicine are required to submit one letter of recommendation, although we will take up to two. References may send their letters either directly to the Office of Admissions or have the applicant send it to the Office of Admissions him/herself in a sealed envelope. Letters should be written by persons who know the applicant well and can evaluate the applicant's skills and abilities. We look especially for those skills that transfer to the classroom setting (critical thinking, reasoning, writing, problem solving, assessment, etc.). Professors make great recommenders (assuming the student has taken a class with them). If an applicant has been out of school for a while, employers are also acceptable sources. Resume: The resume should include work experience, research, activities, community service and any honors/awards received. Supplemental Materials: These include statements regarding academic dismissal, criminal charges, scholarship statements, diversity statements, and/or an addendum with any additional information the applicant wishes to share with the committee. Videotapes, DVDs, cassettes, CDs and lengthy manuscripts will not be reviewed, and will be returned to the applicant. Applicants are selected regardless of race, gender, age, religion, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, marital status, disabilities, or any other protected class under local, state or federal law.Admissions 2014-2015 Catalog | Admissions 13 ND Program Prerequisites College Mathematics 1 course Algebra, calculus or math-based statistics General Chemistry with lab 2 courses Science-major level Organic Chemistry I 1 course Science-major level AND Organic Chemistry II 1 course or Biochemistry Science-major level General Biology with lab 2 courses Science-major level, must cover concepts in cellular biologyPhysics 1 course Must cover mechanics OR Kinesiology 1 course Must be approved Social Sciences 2 courses One course must be in lifespan or developmental psychology Humanities 2 courses At least one course must be English composition Strongly Recommended Courses Cellular Biology Anatomy and Physiology Biochemistry Statistics Business and/or Marketing Other Suggested Courses Biomedical Ethics Philosophy of Science Public Speaking Microbiology Immunology Public HealthMSOM Program Prerequisites General Chemistry 1 course General Biology 1 course Physics 1 course Must include mechanics Social Sciences and Humanities 2 courses Selected from the disciplines of art, music, literature, philosophy and psychology Strongly Recommended Courses Anatomy and Physiology Chinese Language (old Mandarin; complex characters) Systems Science Mythology Quantum Physics Philosophy of Science Biochemistry Cellular Biology Chinese History/Culture MSiMR Program Prerequisites Minimum GRE Scores* Verbal: 150 | Quantitative: 160 | Writing: 4.0 required | NCNM GRE Code: 4528 *Will accept MCAT score of 25 or higher, or a PCAT score at the 60th percentile rank or higher in place of the GRE.

An applicant who applies for transfer credit must meet the current admissions requirements at NCNM on the date the student applies for admission, including the verification of good academic standing. All transfer students must meet the prerequisites as stated in the catalog. 2. Credits being considered for transfer must be graduate level and completed at a U.S. Department of Education recognized and regionally accredited institution. Transfer credit will only be approved for courses from a professional degree program or a graduate program closely related to the health sciences. *See below for specific program requirements. 3. Only credits recorded on an official transcript of the issuing institution with an equivalent grade of 2.0 or better on a 4.0 scale will be considered for transfer. If an application is received before coursework at another institution has been completed, transfer credit will be considered to be conditional until satisfactory completion of the outstanding coursework. 4. Credits accepted for transfer must be determined by NCNM to be substantially equivalent to the courses offered by NCNM. This determination is to be made by the program dean or her/his designee. All requests for transfer credit are considered on a course by course basis, and a catalog or course description will be required. Challenge examinations may be required to determine whether coursework is comparable. 5. Credits accepted for the transfer of coursework must have been awarded within seven years of the date of admission to NCNM, except that NCNM may, at its discretion, accept older credits if the entering student holds a graduate degree in an academic discipline closely related to the health sciences and has been working in the field. 6. The ND and MSOM degree programs could take a minimum of three years education at NCNM, even with maximum transfer credit awarded, due to differences between programs. 7. NCNM does not give transfer credit for life experience. 8. Applications for transfer credit must be accompanied by a letter from the applicant's previous program dean stating that the applicant is in good academic and behavioral standing at the time of application. 9. Credits will be evaluated for transfer before an offer of admission is made. The applicant will receive a copy of the transfer credit evaluation with a list of courses that must be taken at NCNM and a tentative class schedule for their first term, if they are admitted. Students will sign a letter agreeing to the final list of approved transfer credits. 10. Any veteran receiving GI Bill benefits while attending NCNM is required to obtain transcripts from all previously attended schools and submit them to the VA School Official for review of prior credit. Second professional degree candidates, defined as a healthcare practitioner with a doctoral level degree (for application to any of NCNM's degree programs) or master's level degree (for application to the MSOM), may apply for fall or winter admission. Depending upon prior completed coursework, a full-time schedule may not be available for one of these terms of entry. A proposed class schedule for the intended term of entry and a degree completion plan can only be created after a candidate's prior coursework has been evaluated. Please note that there is a $75 non-refundable transcript evaluation fee. Below are transfer policies specific to the School of Naturopathic Medicine and the School of Classical Chinese Medicine beyond those in the general transfer policy section above. *Transfer Credit Specific to the ND Program Transfer credit will be considered for applicants to the ND program who are eligible to sit for a first professional medical licensing examination in the United States. Transfer credit will be allowed for first-year and some second-year ND courses. Credit for clinical experiences or clinical education at another school is not transferable. NCNM has a requirement that all ND students complete thirteen (13) elective credits in addition to the required core curriculum, in order to encourage students to take additional coursework in areas of special interest and round out their education at NCNM. Transfer students may be allowed transfer credit for some of their non-core coursework if completed in a doctoral program at a regionally accredited institution. This determination will be made by the ND program dean or her/his designee. Applicants seeking advance-standing status into the ND program must hold a first professional medical degree. Accepted are medical (MD), osteopathic (DO), and chiropractic (DC) doctors who have graduated from a regionally accredited institution. Satisfaction of this requirement meets the NCNM prerequisite condition for a bachelor's level degree. *Transfer Credit Specific to the MSOM Program Due to the classical orientation of the MSOM program, only a limited number of credits from programs with Admissions | ncnm.edu 16 a traditional orientation are transferable. Only AOM coursework completed at a school approved by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM) will be accepted for MSOM transfer. *Transfer Credit Specific to the School of Research & Graduate Studies Applicants seeking transfer credit to a degree program in the School of Research & Graduate Studies will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Only course work completed at a regionally accredited institution will be accepted. Transfers from NCNM to Other Institutions Transfer of credit from NCNM to other institutions is at the discretion of the receiving institution. Credit generally depends on comparability of curricula and may depend on comparability of accreditation. NCNM is regionally accredited. Inquiries should be directed to the receiving institution to determine the transferability of credits from NCNM. Technical Standards (Specific to the Schools of Naturopathic Medicine and Classical Chinese Medicine) NCNM's goal is to broadly prepare students for the practice of naturopathic and/or Chinese medicine. This goal is achieved in part by undergraduate medical or pre-health education, including prerequisites for admission to NCNM; postgraduate medical education; and preparation for life-long learning. Modern medical and research education requires that the accumulation of scientific knowledge be accompanied by the simultaneous acquisition of skills, professional attitudes and behavior. Our faculty has the responsibility to graduate qualified practitioners, physicians and researchers; thus, admission into NCNM is offered to those who present the highest qualifications for the study and practice of naturopathic and/or Chinese medicine. Please note that retreats, classes and/or clinic shifts are regularly scheduled on weekends. Students must possess the following general qualities: critical thinking; sound judgment; emotional stability and maturity; empathy; physical and mental stamina; and the ability to learn and function in a wide variety of educational settings. In all phases of education, students must use their intellectual ability and must maintain emotional stability, particularly when under stress. Graduates of NCNM must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and render a wide spectrum of patient care. 2014-2015 Catalog | Admissions 17 Motor Skills Students in the ND and CCM medical programs should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. ND/CCM medical students should be able to execute motor functions necessary to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Sensory and Observational Skills Students must be able to observe demonstrations and participate in experiments and patient exams as required by the NCNM curricula. They must be able to observe a patient or study participant accurately at a distance and close at hand, and be able to obtain a medical history directly from the patient or study participant while observing the person's medical condition. This observation necessitates the functional use of vision, hearing and other sensory modalities. Communication Skills Students must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients and study participants, both orally and in written form. These skills must be performed in clinical settings when time for communication may be limited. Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Skills Measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis are skills required for physicians and researchers. Thus, students must be able to solve problems and think critically. In addition, students must be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Skills and Professionalism Empathy, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that will be assessed during the admissions process and throughout a student's education. Medical students must possess the emotional well-being required for the full use of their intellect; the ability to promptly complete all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients; and the capacity to develop mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. All students must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively when stressed. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, display flexibility, and learn to function within the uncertainty inherent to the variety of clinical problems patients present. The mission of National College of Natural Medicine faculty is to prepare students for the comprehensive practice of natural medicine and research. NCNM, in accordance with Section 504 of the 1974 Vocational Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (Public Law 101-336), has established the aforementioned essential functions of students and physicians. NCNM must ensure that patients and study participants are not placed in jeopardy by the students or physicians as a result of substantially impaired intellectual, physical or emotional functions. Students will be assessed not only on their scholastic accomplishments, but also on their physical and emotional capacities to meet the full requirements of the school curricula and to graduate as skilled and effective practitioners of naturopathic and/or Chinese medicine. Students who believe they may not meet the criteria listed above should contact the dean of students and program dean to discuss their specific circumstances. The dean will coordinate assessment and accommodations as deemed appropriate. Unresolved issues concerning a student's ability to meet these standards may result in delay or disqualification of the student's admission or registration. Admissions | ncnm.edu 18 Alumni NCNM has a network of over 2,300 alumni across the United States, Canada and in many other countries.

NCNM Emergency Loans Short-term emergency loan assistance is available to those eligible students who are experiencing an emergency. Budgetary shortfalls such as paying rent/mortgage, utilities, car repair, etc., do not meet the definition of emergency status. The emergency loan is considered a loan of last resort for those experiencing a true emergency. The maximum amount that can be borrowed is $500. A $10 loan processing fee may be charged for each loan. Please contact the director of financial aid to request an application to be considered. Students must also be in good academic standing and cannot borrow this loan in the final quarter of the academic year. Student Responsibilities When students register for classes at NCNM, they incur charges on their account. Students are responsible for payment of all charges on their account by the due date, even if another party is paying the account. Students experiencing financial problems in the payment of any tuition and fees are responsible for contacting the Business Office to make satisfactory arrangements. Students are responsible for keeping NCNM informed of their current address and should submit address changes to the Registrar's Office immediately upon moving. Students are responsible for formally withdrawing from classes they wish to drop. Students who fail to formally drop classes during the refund period are responsible for the tuition charges. (See section on Add and Drop Policy.) Any assessment or judgment against a student for damage to NCNM property, whether arising from a Student Conduct Code proceeding or a court action, shall be considered money due NCNM as if it were tuition. No transcripts or diplomas will be released to the student until the amount due the college has been paid. The Business Office may also block future registration.Financial Policies 2014-2015Financial Policies | ncnm.edu 20 Academic Fees Clinic Shift Change Fee $50 Clinic Skill Enhancement (6 weeks) $600 Clinic Private Tutoring (6 weeks) $1500 CPR Initial Certification Fee (5 hours) $50 (required re-certification every two years) CPR Re-Certification Fee (3 hours) $40 Change of Track Fee (per subsequent change after one free change) $50 Challenge Examination Fee $60 and 50% of the per credit rate Petition to Deviate $50 each approved submission Independent Study Fee equal to one credit hour of tuition ND GPA 1, 2 & 3 Initial Exam (charged to student's account) $100 MSOM Initial Exit Exam $100 ND GPA 1, 2 & 3 Retake Remediation Exam (fee each) $75 (payable before Retake can be taken)MSOM Retake/Remediation Exam (fee each) $75 (payable before Retake can be taken)GPA (any) Skill Enhancement (3 weeks) $300 MSOM Qigong $75 Lab $10 MSOM Herbs II Lab $10 MSOM Herbs Philosophy Retreat* $125 Remediation (Makeup) Exam Fee $60 (each payable before Exam can be taken, no charge for excused absence)Remediation (Makeup) Quiz Fee No charge (each payable before Quiz can be taken)Shaw Island Herb Intensive* $165 Cascade Mountain Herb Intensive* $165NOTE: The college is not responsible for any loss of, or damage to, the personal property of a student. Other Expenses Students are required to purchase textbooks and other personal equipment, as well as basic diagnostic equipment for use in courses and clinic. These costs vary from year to year. Tuition and Fee Refund Policies If a student finds it necessary to withdraw, either completely or from specific courses, the following policies apply: The application fee, submitted with the initial application for acceptance to NCNM, is nonrefundable. The acceptance deposit fee will be forfeited by a student who withdraws after accepting admission, but before attending classes. Calculation of tuition refunds are based on the date the student begins NCNM's withdrawal process. Tuition refunds will first be applied to balances due NCNM. If a student receiving financial aid is eligible for a refund, that refund is returned to the Federal Financial Aid program. Tuition refunds are calculated according to NCNM's tuition and fee refund policy outlined below: Week of Quarter Tuition Refund Rate First week 100% tuition Second week100% tuition 90% tuition (if withdrawing from school completely) Third week 80% tuition Fourth week 70% tuition Fifth week 60% tuition Sixth week 50% tuition Beyond sixth week No refund Any refund of tuition and fees resulting from a withdrawal or a reclassification of tuition status must be applied to the recipient's financial aid awards before any payment is made to the student. Tuition refunds are calculated according to NCNM's tuition and fee refund policy. Return of Federal Title IV funds is calculated according to Department of Education regulations. (See Financial Aid section for more information.) Students whose accounts were paid-in-full often have a balance due NCNM after withdrawal. The Title IV return of funds policy operates independently of the college's tuition refund policy. It is possible for a withdrawing student to owe NCNM money because aid must be returned to the Title IV program, but the student is not entitled to a refund of institutional charges. Federal regulations for this refund policy allow the college to retain an administrative fee that reduces the institutional charges subject to refund. This fee is five percent of total charges, up to a maximum of $100. Furthermore, federal regulations require that any student who has received a loan while attending NCNM and who leaves the college for any reason, including official leaves of absence, must participate in a loan exit interview. Exit interviews are conducted by the Financial Aid Office and can be arranged by calling that office.

NCNM participates in federal financial aid programs, including loans and work-study, in addition to non-federal programs such as the Student Employment Program (STEP). Financial aid is available to students enrolled at least half time. NCNM's definition of half-time enrollment is 5.5 credits. Full-time enrollment is a minimum of 11 credits. All students applying for federal financial aid are required to file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. This document becomes available January 1 each year. Additionally, students must have been accepted and paid all required fees and deposits at NCNM to receive financial aid information. Eligibility for financial aid is determined using a federal methodology formula as outlined by the U.S. Department of Education. The financial aid awarding process begins in early spring of each academic year for matriculated students, and late spring for new students entering in the fall. NCNM's Early Bird packaging date is February 15 for need-based aid consideration. Federal work-study is the only need-based aid available at NCNM. Funds are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to the highest need students as determined by the U.S. Department of Education. Availability for this need-based grant is dependent on the annual federal allocation received at the college and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. As NCNM is a graduate institution, all students are considered \"independent\" and are eligible to receive the maximum allowable in federal loans. Graduate students are eligible to receive Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford and Graduate PLUS Loans. Amounts received will depend on the institutional cost of attendance budget for the program chosen. Students receiving federal financial aid are required to disclose all outside resources received on their behalf to the Financial Aid Office. These resources will be included and calculated as part of their financial aid award packet. To continue to receive financial aid, the student must make satisfactory academic progress, as defined by academic policies, and must be enrolled at least half time to qualify for federal aid. The Financial Aid Office can advise the student about sources of financial aid and budgeting strategies. This office is available as a resource even after the student leaves the college. Alumni may contact the Financial Aid Office for information about confidential counseling on students' debts and loan repayment, both by phone and email. We want to provide you with clear and concise information about financial aid. This is a brief overview of federal financial aid programs available to eligible students at NCNM. To be considered an \"eligible student,\" you must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and be enrolled at least half time at the college. Students who attend NCNM on an F-1 Visa (foreign students) are not eligible to participate in federal student aid programs. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) To apply for federal student financial aid, and to apply for many state student aid programs, students must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The information you provide on your FAFSA determines if you are eligible for financial aid. The Federal Title IV school code for NCNM is B07624. The application and other important information is located at fafsa.gov. Federal Direct Loan Program National College of Natural Medicine currently processes Federal Unsubsidized Stafford and Graduate PLUS loans through the Federal Direct Loan program, in which borrowers obtain loan funds directly from the U.S. Department of Education. Types of Loans Ninety-eight percent of students attending NCNM find it necessary to receive some form of financial assistance. How - ever, loans comprise the majority of financial aid at NCNM. Student loan borrowers must sign a Master Promissory Note (MPN) which details the terms of their agreement with the U.S. Department of Education. As a condition of signing the MPN, the student agrees to restrict use of student loan funds to pay for current year educationally related expenses only and as such, agrees to immediately repay any loan pro - ceeds that cannot be attributed to educational expenses for attendance, on at least a half-time basis, at NCNM. The maximum amount of graduate student education loans available will depend on a student's program(s) of enrollment. The student should keep in mind the amount of loans they choose to borrow and their overall indebted - ness, and that the money borrowed will have to be repaid with interest. All students interested in federal loans must complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Fixed interest rates for 2014-2015: Federal Direct Stafford Loan: 6.21% Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan: 7.21% Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan This loan accrues interest immediately upon disbursement and during the grace period. Students are Financial Aid2014-2015 Catalog | Financial Aid 23 offered the option of paying the interest while they are in school, or they may capitalize the interest (add the interest to the principal) when the loan enters repayment. Maximum unsubsidized loan amounts are determined by subtracting all financial aid received from the estimated Cost of Attendance (COA) budget, as well as considering the student's eligibility and program of enrollment. Aggregate Graduate Loan Limits for Master's Degree Programs The maximum amount of student education loans is limited federally to $20,500 per nine-month period (academic year), and cannot exceed a maximum borrowing amount of $138,500\u2014of which no more than $65,500 can be in subsidized loans. This aggregate limit includes undergraduate loan debt and applies to students enrolled solely in master's degree programs. Extended Loan Limits and Aggregate Cap for Naturopathic Degree Students and Concurrent-Track Cap The Secretary of Education has added naturopathic medicine as an approved discipline eligible for increased unsubsidized Stafford amounts\u2014if the program is offered by a domestic institution that is accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). The additional amount, up to $20,000 if the academic year of the program is nine months in length and up to $26,667 if the academic year is 12 months in length, can be awarded only to students enrolled in a program that leads to a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (NMD) degree, Doctor of Naturopathy (ND) degree, or a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) degree. In either case, loan limits cannot exceed the student's cost of attendance budget. The new aggregate limit for eligible students is $224,000\u2014of which no more than $65,500 can be in subsidized loans. These limits include all loans made to the student for all attendance, including loans received as an undergraduate student. Students enrolled in a concurrent track are eligible to receive the extended loan limits as long as they have not completed their ND degree program. Students enrolled in a concurrent track typically find that they will need loans beyond the Stafford Loan Program, such as the Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan. Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan This is a federal fixed-rate loan that can be used to help cover the costs of attending college for graduate students who are enrolled at least half time. You must be either a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. A credit check is required; however, income or assets and credit scores are not typically considered as part of the eligibility criteria. Before applying for a Graduate PLUS Loan, a graduate or professional student must also apply for, and the school must determine the student's eligibility for, the maximum annual Federal Unsubsidized Loan amounts. We expect that a Graduate PLUS applicant would wish to receive a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan to supplement the maximum Federal Unsubsidized Loan amounts that he or she is eligible to receive. However, a graduate or professional student is not required to receive Federal Unsubsidized Loan funds as a condition for receiving a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan. For more information about this loan, please contact the Financial Aid Office. Emergency Loans Emergency loans are permitted in the event of an actual emergency and only in the term they occur. Loan requests may range from $100 to $500 depending upon the availability of funds. Emergency loans are only available to students with an acute immediate need, at the discretion of the director of financial aid. Additional criteria for this loan are outlined in the application process. Emergency Loan Examples: Personal/Family Crisis - a situation or period in which things are very uncertain, difficult or painful; especially a time when action must be taken to avoid complete disaster or breakdown Disaster - an event that causes serious loss, destruction, hardship or death Tragedy - serious illness, financial ruin or fatality Theft - having property stolen, vehicle damage, etc. Change of Program Track and Adding/Dropping Courses - Effect on Financial Aid Students receiving federal financial aid must provide their Student Status Change form or Add/Drop form and Financial Aid | ncnm.edu 24 schedule a meeting with the Financial Aid Office staff to discuss program changes that may affect their eligibility for financial aid. Financial Aid Refund Procedure If a student receiving financial aid is eligible for a refund, that refund is returned to the Federal Financial Aid program. If the amount of the refund exceeds the total amount of aid, the excess will be returned to the student. Federal regulations require that any student who has received a loan while attending NCNM and who leaves the college for any reason, including official leaves of absence, must participate in a loan exit interview. Exit interviews are conducted by the Financial Aid Office and can be arranged by calling that office. Return of Federal Title IV Funds NCNM is required to recalculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a leave of absence prior to completing at least 60 percent of an academic quarter. Recalculation is done from the actual date the student begins the institution's withdrawal process. For students who leave without notifying the institution, calculations will be made from the last day of recorded attendance or the midpoint of the quarter. Recalculation is based on formulas that determine the amount of aid earned and the amount of aid to be returned. The formulas used for recalculation can be obtained from NCNM's Financial Aid Office. Federal refund calculations are completely independent of NCNM's tuition refund policies. Federal Title IV Funds are always returned in the order mandated by the U.S. Department of Education. For graduate-level students attending NCNM, the order is: 1. Unsubsidized Stafford Loan 2. Graduate PLUS loan Note: The Federal Title IV refund calculations only apply to withdrawals from all classes. However, if a student changes track and if there is an adjustment made to her/his tuition charge, the Financial Aid Office may recalculate the student's Cost of Attendance budget to see if her/his aid eligibility has changed. Federal Work-Study Program The Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP) provides job opportunities that complement and reinforce our student's educational and career goals. The program is available to students as an alternate resource to earn money to help cover educational expenses. Student employees earn an hourly wage and are paid monthly. Part-time employment while enrolled in school can help make ends meet. However, due to the demands of the programs, students generally find their schedules limit the amount of time they can work to 20 hours per week or less. The Financial Aid Office administers a Federal Work-Study Program and maintains an online timesheet database. NCNM has a priority packaging date of February 15 for need-based aid consideration. Students with demonstrated financial need and who indicate on the FAFSA application an interest in work-study are eligible to receive an award. However, due to fund limitations, only those students with the highest need will receive an award. FWSP is a federally subsidized program with a limited allocation. The number of students receiving an award is limited by the program funding received, and is awarded to students as applications are received, until the funding is fully utilized. Allocated funds could be exhausted regardless of whether or not a student applies by the priority deadline. Federal Work-Study Conditions and Limitations The following are mandated conditions and limitations regarding student employment, and are summarized as follows: Federal Work-Study is governed by any and all applicable federal, state and/or local laws. Federal Work-Study must not displace employees or impair existing service contracts. Replacement is interpreted as displacement. Federal Work-Study employees must be paid for all hours worked. The Fair Labor Standards Act prohibits employers from accepting voluntary services from any person who has been compensated for those worked hours. Students receiving, or eligible to receive, Federal Work-Study funds may not receive student employment funds. The Federal Work-Study Program allows students to work on- or off-campus to earn money to be applied to education-related expenses. The typical annual FWSP award ranges from $300 to $690. Wage rates are $11 per hour and these jobs include positions such as teaching assistant, grader, library assistant, medicinary support, front desk help, patient coordinator and reading tutor, to name a few. To view a list of current work- study opportunities, please visit the Student Life web page and select work-study listings. Search all departments to see all jobs posted for the year. Only eligible Federal Work-Study students at NCNM are eligible to apply for these positions. Student Employment Program The Student Employment Program (STEP) provides job opportunities that complement and reinforce our 2014-2015 Catalog | Financial Aid 25 student's educational and career goals. The program is available to students as an alternate resource to earn money to help cover educational expenses. Student employees earn an hourly wage and are paid monthly. The STEP program operates independent from the Federal Work-Study Program. Limited positions exist and students employed by this program are subject to the budgeted funds of the department. Students employed under the STEP program cannot work under the Federal Work-Study Program. Student Employment Conditions and Limitations The following are mandated conditions and limitations regarding student employment, and are summarized as follows: Student employment is governed by any and all applicable federal, state and/or local laws. Student employment must not displace employees or impair existing service contracts. Replacement is interpreted as displacement. Student employees must be paid for all hours worked. The Fair Labor Standards Act prohibits employers from accepting voluntary services from any person who has been compensated for those worked hours. Student employees are provided with limited funds determined by the hiring department each budget year. Students receiving, or eligible to receive, student employment funds may not receive federal work- study funds. STEP awards are included in the cost of attendance budget as an outside resource and other aid may be reduced. Student Employment Criteria In order to participate in the Student Employment Program (STEP), a student must be an international student; or be ineligible for the Federal Work-Study Program; or have voluntarily relinquished their FWSP award. Note: students missing the financial aid priority deadline or failing to file the FAFSA are not eligible for STEP funds. Eligibility and Rehabilitation Financial Aid Policy and Drug-Related Convictions Students are ineligible for Federal Title IV aid if convicted of an offense involving the possession or sale of illegal drugs. The period of ineligibility is contingent upon the offense committed and on whether the student is a first-time or repeat offender. (Information on Oregon and federal sanctions, and periods of ineligibility, is available from the Office of Financial Aid and in the student handbook.)Drug Rehabilitation To restore Title IV eligibility early, students must success - fully complete a qualified drug rehabilitation program. This program must conduct two unannounced drug tests and receive, or be qualified to receive, funds directly or indirectly from a federal, state or local government program. Government Program An acceptable government program is one that is adminis - tered or recognized by a federal, state or local government agency or court. The drug rehabilitation program must be qualified to receive, or is currently receiving, payment directly or indirectly from a state-licensed insurance company; or administered or recognized by a state-licensed hospital, health clinic or medical doctor. Scholarships Money received from scholarship sources does not have to be repaid. At NCNM, there are limited scholarships available for entering and matriculated students. In order to be assured full consideration for available scholarships, students are encouraged to submit application materials in a timely manner. The amount and availability varies for all scholarships from year to year. Admissions Scholarships Decisions on scholarship awards for incoming students are based on a holistic evaluation of the entire application file and are made at the same time admissions decisions are made. Applicants do not need to complete a separate application for these scholarships. Since these awards are given on a rolling basis, the prob - ability of receiving a scholarship decreases for applications received later in the year. As of the end of January, approx - imately half of the available scholarships have already been awarded. For more information about these scholarships, please contact the Admissions Office at 503.552.1660. NCNM Enrolled Student Scholarships All current full-time students in good academic standing are encouraged to apply for student scholarships. Finalists are selected based on a record of outstanding academic achievement, leadership, service to the college and community, dedication to the profession of natural medicine, and a commitment to honoring and celebrating diversity. Scholarship applications are available late in spring term of each year. Selected recipients are announced after spring term and are awarded evenly over the students' following academic year. Additional criteria may apply. The Office of Advancement operates the college's scholarship program. More information about scholarship availability can be obtained by contacting the vice president of advancement at 503.552.1512.School of Naturopathic Medicine | ncnm.edu 26 Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic medicine is a patient-centered primary care approach that uses natural means to restore and optimize health. It is a distinct system of health care\u2014an art, science, philosophy and practice of diagnosing, treating and preventing disease. Naturopathic medicine is heir to the vitalistic tradition of medicine in the Western world and emphasizes the treat - ment of disease through the stimulation, enhancement and support of the inherent healing power of the body. Methods of treatment are chosen that respect the natural healing process. History of Naturopathic Medicine The roots of naturopathic medicine go back thousands of years, drawing on the healing wisdom of many cultures including East Indian (Ayurvedic), Chinese (Taoist), Greek (Hippocratic), Arabian, Egyptian and European (monastic medicine) traditions. With the age of scientific inquiry, medicine took on differing dimensions and developed new tools for fighting disease. In fact, many older time-tested healing and health main - tenance methods were discarded at a rapid rate as doctors began treating disease almost solely with surgery and drugs. Some practitioners in Europe and the United States, however, recognized that valuable, empirically proven natural therapies were being lost, and struggled to retain the practice of promoting health through stimulation of the vital force and the appropriate use of natural agents. As a distinct North American healthcare profession, naturopathic medicine is well over 100 years old, with origins tracing back to Dr. Benedict L\u00fcst and Dr. Robert Foster. Dr. L\u00fcst originally came to the United States from Germany to practice and teach hydrotherapy techniques popularized in Europe by Sebastian Kneipp. A committee of Kneipp practitioners met in 1900 and determined that the practice should be expanded to incorporate all natural methods of healing, including botanical medicines, nutritional therapy, physiotherapy, psychology (mind/ body connection), homeopathy and the manipulative therapies. They called their profession \"naturopathy.\" The first school of naturopathy was founded by Dr. L\u00fcst in New York City and graduated its first class in 1902. During the same period, Dr. Foster founded a similar institution in Idaho that trained the early naturopathic pioneers responsible for establishing licensing laws in Oregon and Washington states. Naturopathic medical conventions in the 1920s attracted more than 10,000 naturopathic physicians. There were more than 20 naturopathic medical colleges and NDs were licensed in a majority of states. Naturopathic medicine experienced a decline in the 1940s and '50s with the rise of pharmaceutical drugs, technological medicine, and the idea that drugs could eliminate all disease. As ND degree programs began closing down, one after another, NCNM was founded to keep the medicine alive. The drop-off in popularity was so steep that during its first 20 years, NCNM graduated only 70 students. From its founding in 1956 until 1979, when three of its alumni founded John Bastyr College (now Bastyr University) in Seattle, NCNM was the only naturopathic college in the United States. Founded by those who began practicing in the 1920s and '30s, NCNM has been at the center of the profession for more than half a century, preserving and extending the legacy of naturopathic medicine by training future physicians. The profession has experienced resurgence in the past two decades as a health-conscious public has sought alternatives for conditions that conventional medicine has not adequately addressed. Since the late 1970s, NCNM alumni have opened three more naturopathic colleges and NCNM enrollment has quadrupled. This growth is in direct response to the changing needs of our society. Not only is the public demanding a medical model in which the individual plays a more active role in her/his health and healing process, but doctors also want a medical model that is more patient-centered and holistic. NCNM is alma mater to more than 2,000 naturopathic physicians. Our graduates practice in a rapidly growing number of U.S. states, territories, Canadian provinces and many foreign countries. Many are nationally acclaimed healthcare experts, as well as successful physicians. NCNM alumni have been advancing the naturopathic profession\u2014and the benefits of naturopathic medicine since the college's founding in 1956. This is an exciting time to join the profession and help make history in the field of naturopathic medicine. Scope of Practice Naturopathic physicians' scope of practice varies by jurisdiction. Once universally licensed in the United States, naturopathic physicians have seen their laws sunset in many states over the past 50 years. Currently, 17 states, Washington D.C., the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and six Canadian provinces license naturopathic physicians. Many jurisdictions regard NDs as primary care physicians and provide them with a diagnostic and therapeutic scope of practice necessary to provide a wide range of treatment options. These include general and preventive health care, as well as diagnosis and treatment School of Naturopathic Medicine2014-2015 Catalog | School of Naturopathic Medicine 27 for acute and chronic conditions. In those jurisdictions in which NDs are not licensed, the scope of practice excludes the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The naturopathic physician is defined by the U.S. Department of Labor as one who: \"Diagnoses, treats and cares for patients, using a system of practice that bases treatment of physiological functions and abnormal conditions on natural laws governing [the] human body: Utilizes physiological, psychological and mechanical methods, such as air, water, light, heat, earth, phytotherapy, food and herb therapy, psychotherapy, electrotherapy, physiotherapy, minor and orificial surgery, mechanotherapy, naturopathic corrections and manipulation, and natural methods and modalities, together with natural medicines, natural processed foods and herbs and nature's remedies. Excludes major surgery, therapeutic use of X-ray and radium, and use of drugs, except those assimilable substances containing elements or compounds which are components of body tissues and are physiologically compatible to body processes for maintenance of life.\" (Yet many states have broad drug formularies that allow NDs to prescribe drugs.) It should be noted that the state of Utah requires a one-year residency before licensing NDs. Like other physicians, recently graduated NDs are encouraged to seek additional clinical experience under the supervision of a licensed physician in the form of residencies and mentorships. Licensing and Certification of Naturopathic Physicians Naturopathic doctors are legally recognized to practice medicine throughout the United States and U.S. territories, Canada, as well as many other countries. NDs are fully licensed to practice as primary care physicians in: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Washington. They are also licensed in Washington D.C., the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. In other U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions, a varying scope of naturopathic practice may be permitted or protected by court decisions, attorney general opinions or local regulations. Efforts to enact licensing laws are underway in several American states, and licensure legislation is in the final stages of consideration in several states. The best sources of current information about the legal status of naturopathic medicine in a particular area are the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (818 18th Street NW, Suite 250, Washington, DC 20006, or naturopathic.org), state or provincial naturopathic School of Naturopathic Medicine | ncnm.edu 28 associations, and individual naturopathic physicians practicing in those areas. Currently all states that license naturopathic physicians require graduation from a residential course of study offered through a college approved by the examining jurisdiction. NCNM meets all requirements of, and is accredited by, the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). Completion of the ND degree at NCNM or another CNME recognized institution qualifies candidates to sit for a board licensing examination which every applicant must pass to be licensed. Similarly, NCNM graduates are eligible to sit for examination in Canadian provinces that license naturopathic medicine. While each jurisdiction has its own examination requirements, an increasing number use the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Exam (NPLEX) as part or all of the required testing.

Principles of Naturopathic Medicine The practice of naturopathic medicine emerges from six principles of healing. These principles are based on the objective observation of the nature of health and disease, and are examined continually in light of scientific analysis. These principles stand as the distinguishing marks of the profession: First Do No Harm primum non nocere Therapeutic actions that are complementary to and synergistic with the body's innate healing process prevent harm to patients. Naturopathic physicians follow three precepts to avoid harming the patient: Use methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful effects and apply the least possible force or intervention necessary to diagnose illness and restore health. Whenever possible, avoid symptom suppression as it can interfere with the healing process. Respect and cooperate with the vis medicatrix naturae in diagnosis, treatment and counseling. The Healing Power of Nature vis medicatrix naturae The body has the inherent ability to establish, maintain and restore health. The healing process is ordered and intelligent; nature heals through the response of the life force. The physician's role is to facilitate and augment this process, to identify and remove obstacles to health and recovery and to support the creation of a healthy internal and external environment. 2014-2015 Catalog | School of Naturopathic Medicine 29 Identify and Treat the Cause tolle causam Illness does not occur without cause. Underlying causes of disease must be discovered, and removed or treated, before a person can recover completely from illness. Symptoms are expressions of the body's attempt to heal, but are not the cause of disease; therefore, naturopathic medicine addresses itself primarily to the underlying causes of disease, rather than to the symptoms. Causes may occur on many levels, including physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. The physician must evaluate fundamental underlying causes on all levels, directing treatment at root causes as well as seeking relief of symptoms. Treat the Whole Person in perturbato animo sicut in corpore sanitas esse non potest Health and disease are conditions of the whole organism, involving a complex interaction of physical, spiritual, men - tal, emotional, genetic, environmental and social factors. The physician must treat the whole person by taking all of these factors into account. The harmonious functioning of all aspects of the individual is essential to recovery from and prevention of disease, and requires a personalized and comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment. The Physician as Teacher docere Beyond an accurate diagnosis and appropriate prescription, the physician must work to create a healthy, sensitive interpersonal relationship with the patient. A cooperative doctor-patient relationship has inherent therapeutic value. The physician's major role is to educate and encourage the patient to take responsibility for her/ his own health. The physician is a catalyst for healthful change, empowering and motivating the patient to assume responsibility. It is the patient, not the doctor, who ultimately creates or accomplishes healing. The physician must strive to inspire optimism as well as understanding. The physician must also make a commitment to her/his personal and spiritual development in order to be a good teacher. Prevention principiis obsta: sero medicina curatur The ultimate goal of naturopathic medicine is prevention. This is accomplished through education and promotion of lifestyle habits that foster good health. The physician assesses risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease and makes appropriate interventions to avoid further harm and risk to the patient. The emphasis is on building health, rather than on fighting disease. Because it is difficult to be healthy in an unhealthy world, it is the responsibility of both physician and patient to create a healthier environment in which to live.Diagnostic Techniques NDs are trained in conventional diagnostic techniques such as physical exam, laboratory testing, differential diagnosis, X-ray and ultrasound imaging, and psycho - logical assessment. In addition, NDs use specialized laboratory tests that assess physiological function, as well as other observational, physical, examination and evaluation techniques. NDs endeavor to identify disease states in the context of the individual's overall health. Therapeutic Techniques Botanical Medicine: Many plant substances are powerful medicines. Where isolated chemically derived drugs may address only a single problem, botanical medicines are able to address a variety of problems simultaneously. When properly administered, most botanical medicines can be applied effectively with minimal chance of side effects. Clinical Nutrition: Food is the best medicine and is a cornerstone of naturopathic practice. Many medical conditions can be treated effectively with foods and nutritional supplements, with fewer complications and side effects. NDs use diet, natural hygiene, fasting and nutritional supplementation in their practices. Homeopathic Medicine: Homeopathic medicine is the treatment of disease/symptoms using correctly prescribed, minimal doses of natural substances (plant, animal, mineral), which, if taken in larger doses, would cause disease/symptoms\u2014the acting principle being \"like cures like.\" It promotes the return to health on physical, mental and spiritual levels. Mind/Body Medicine: Mental attitudes and emotional states may influence or even cause physical illness. Counseling, nutritional balancing, stress management, biofeedback and other therapies are used to help patients heal psychologically. Minor Surgery: Naturopathic physicians do in-office minor surgery, including repair of superficial wounds and removal of foreign bodies, cysts and other superficial lesions. Naturopathic Natural Childbirth/Midwifery: Trained and licensed naturopathic physicians provide childbirth care in and out of hospital settings. They offer prenatal and postnatal care using modern diagnostic techniques combined with ancient midwifery wisdom. The naturo - pathic approach strengthens healthy body functions so that complications associated with pregnancy may be prevented. NCNM offers an elective course sequence resulting in a Natural Childbirth Certificate that allows students to apply for separate licensure in naturopathic natural childbirth. Chinese Medicine: Within the ND program, Chinese medicine is a healing philosophy that is complementary to naturopathic medicine. Chinese medical theory offers an School of Naturopathic Medicine | ncnm.edu 30 important understanding of the unity of the body and mind, while adding to the Western understanding of physiology and therapies. An introductory course in Chinese medicine is included in the core naturopathic curriculum. Physical Medicine: Naturopathic medicine has its own methods of therapeutic manipulation of soft tissue, muscles, bones and spine. NDs also use ultrasound, diathermy, exercise, massage, water, heat and cold, and other gentle electrical therapies in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions and pain. IV Therapy: Intravenous and intramuscular injections of micronutrients and macronutrients are used for many purposes, from simple nutritional support to detoxification procedures in cases of poisonings, and specific treatment of both chronic and acute diseases. Nature Cure: The use of time-honored natural treatments including fresh air, exercise, whole foods and hydrotherapy are important in the naturopathic treatment and prevention of disease.Naturopathic practice includes the use of any medicinal substances that contain elements which are components of bodily tissues, or can be utilized by the body for the maintenance of life and the repair of tissues. The current scope of practice in Oregon includes minor surgery techniques. While naturally derived pharmaceutical drugs have been within the scope of naturopathic practice in Oregon for decades, legislation now allows naturopathic physicians to use most prescription pharmaceutical agents commonly employed in a primary care setting, effective January 2010. \"Scope of practice\" is specifically defined by legislation in the various states and provinces that license or regulate naturopathic medicine, and practice varies significantly among states, provinces and countries. 2014-2015 Catalog | Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine 31 The ND degree course of study at NCNM is an intensive four-year doctoral program that prepares candidates for national (NPLEX) and state board licensing examinations, and the general practice of naturopathic medicine. Upon graduation, alumni are eligible to sit for board examinations in states and provinces that license naturopathic physicians. The core, or required, curriculum provides the foundation and skills necessary for naturopathic family practice. First-year studies include the normal structure and function of the body with a solid introduction to naturopathic theory, philosophy and therapeutics. To enter second-year clinical training, students must pass the hydrotherapy lecture and lab course. Second year focuses on the study of disease and diagnosis, while beginning the botanical, therapeutic manipulation, clinical nutrition and homeopathic medicine sequences. To enter into third-year clinical training, students must pass all basic sciences and diagnostic courses, as well as a clinic entrance examination (Graduate Proficiency Assessment 1/GPA1). Students are eligible to take NPLEX biomedical sciences board exams after completing second-year courses. Third year continues to focus on the botanical, manipu - lation, clinical nutrition and homeopathic medicine sequences; begins the organ systems courses (which emphasize case management); and gives major emphasis to clinical training. Students must pass a clinical primary status exam (Graduate Proficiency Assessment 2/GPA2) to proceed to primary status in the clinic. Students in the fourth year continue the organ systems courses. The major focus of the fourth year is practical clinical training, working closely with licensed physicians caring for patients. A clinic proficiency exam (Graduate Proficiency Assessment 3/GPA3) is an exit examination that demonstrates clinical competency prior to graduation. Because the program is rigorous and the course load heavy, students may apply to complete the ND degree in five rather than four years. In some cases, students may be required to be in the five-year track. Students may take no more than seven years to complete the ND program. While at NCNM, students can undertake any two programs concurrently (e.g., ND/MSOM, ND/MSiMR, MSOM/MScN, etc.). Contact the Office of Admissions for more information.

Its roots extend back thousands of years\u2014to the wisdom and work of sages who understood that the human being is a microcosm of the natural world (the macrocosm). They recognized that everything in the material world, including the human body, is a creation and reflection of a higher dimension of reality, and that health and harmony result from living in accordance with laws of nature that are ultimately discernable. Deeply attuned to the rhythms of nature, ancient yangsheng (\"nurturing life\") practitioners learned to read the map of that higher reality (the Dao ) as it is imprinted in (literally \"in-forms\") the physical realm. The symptoms of disease were not seen as errors to be eradicated, but were instead read as signals of a disharmony that could be resolved to regain the experience of wholeness. It is of immeasurable benefit to the profession that the wisdom of the ancients is codified in works referred to as the \"classical texts\" of Chinese medicine. While some consider these texts to be but curious museum-worthy artifacts, classically oriented practitioners recognize and honor them as key resources in the essential quest of unlocking the secrets of existence. Even with the aid of these timeless treasures, the journey requires a steadfast seriousness of purpose. The combinations of classical Chinese characters comprising these works are rich etymological word fields having many layers of symbolic meaning. Discernment of the depth of meaning contained in even a short passage can require the rhythmical interplay of scholarly pursuit, contemplative study, and ultimately, the illumination of one's own clinical experience. Therefore, even excellent scholarly translations capture but a fraction of the richness contained in the original language. This is why it is extremely valuable to 1) study with those who have a demonstrated dedication to, and facility with, the texts, 2) develop one's own capacity to enter the texts directly through the original classical characters, and 3) maintain a sense of respect for the vastness of the wisdom contained in the texts, and humility regarding one's own level of mastery. School of Classical Chinese Medicine The Classical Approach at NCNM Heiner Fruehauf, PhD, LAc , was pursuing scholarship in Sinology (the study of Chinese language, literature and history) when he entered the profession of Chinese medicine through the doorway of his own health challenges. An essential feature of his medical education was lineage-style apprenticeship with renowned experts in Daoist and classical Chinese medicine. When hired by NCNM in 1992, Dr. Fruehauf's mission of developing a unique offering in Chinese medicine was inspired and informed by discussions with his mentors. Their vision continues to attract a group of like-minded scholar-practitioners from across Asia and the West who are committed to training students excited to explore and embody the richness and true power of the classical approach. The School of CCM rises to the challenge of delivering classical, lineage-based training within the structure of a modern graduate education. The program as a whole is designed by faculty schooled in the classical traditions. Many have access to knowledge that is not expressed or taught in any Western language. Under their tutelage, all students gain a classical orientation to the medicine. Students motivated to enter the classical texts directly through the classical characters have the incredible opportunity to do so under the mentorship of world-class scholars, working with texts that include the Yijing, Daodejing, Zhuangzi, Huangdi neijing, Shanghanlun and Jinggui CCM also offers a quarterly \"Scholar's Hour\" at which individual faculty members present classical topics dear to their hearts. Key curriculum features of the classical approach include the following: Didactic The first year of training is an immersion experience in which students are introduced to the fundamental values, principles and practices of CCM; and become familiar with the historical, philosophical and cultural context in which the many streams of this medicine The School of Classical Chinese Medicine is committed to transmitting the art, science and spirit of Chinese medicine to cultivate clinical practitioners rooted in the ancient tradition of the medical scholar.School of Classical Chinese Medicine | ncnm.edu 56 arose in mainland China. With this foundation, students then gain an understanding of the origins and potential strengths and limitations of the modern TCM approach. Biomedicine is introduced after students have a foundation in CCM (starting in the second year), so that they can learn how to integrate biomedical knowledge into the much more expansive framework of CCM. This approach is in conscious contrast to the modern trend of interpreting Chinese medicine from within the material confines of the biomedical perspective. The School of CCM believes that the brilliance of biomedicine is most powerfully applied within the context of whole-systems science, and that Chinese medicine (and any other whole-systems science) can truly flourish only when understood and applied according to its own precepts and tenets. The curriculum emphasizes CCM as a macrocosm/microcosm symbol science. During the second year, students explore the cosmology and symbolism associated with the 12 Chinese organ networks. In the following year, they gain a deeper functional understanding of the acupuncture channels by studying the symbolic meaning of the acupuncture point names. The third year is devoted to the refinement of clinical skills and the advancement of clinical reasoning. Incorporating modern and classical case studies, students learn to compare and (as appropriate) integrate biomedical, TCM and classical approaches to patient diagnosis and treatment. In the fourth year, students undertake one of the signature features of the program\u2014a year-long \"Traditional Mentorship Tutorial\" series. The small-group, apprentice-style format of this unique offering affords students the opportunity to absorb the lineage system of their chosen mentor. This series has been so successful that students initiated the creation of an elective version offered in the third year. Clinical Students begin their clinical training as \"observers\" at the start of their second year. They learn from seasoned clinical faculty as they (the faculty) diagnose and treat clinic patients using individual lineage styles of practice. During the fifth and sixth quarters of the observation phase of training, the clinical rotations are designed to enhance the confidence and competence of students transitioning into the internship phase of training. In the \"Clinical Mentoring Rotation,\" students become directly involved in the intake and treatment of patients under the complete and compassionate guidance of their clinical supervisor. In the \"Pre-Internship Rotation,\" students become familiar with the process and 2014-2015 Catalog | School of Classical Chinese Medicine 57 responsibilities of being an intern, by shadowing and supporting the interns who are about to graduate. During the final year of study, students step into the role of intern and assume an increasing level of responsibility for the diagnosis and treatment of patients under the expert supervision of the clinical faculty. Through an application process, each intern is paired with a clinical faculty mentor of their choosing, with whom they are guaranteed at least one Internship Rotation per quarter throughout the final year. This ensures that students receive continuity of training in their resonant style of practice, and gain experience in the long-term management of patient cases. Cultivation While all coursework contributes to the cultivation of a mature clinical practitioner, specific opportunities and exercises are included to promote professionalism, the growth of perceptual awareness, emotional intelligence, cultural competence, and ultimately, the embodiment of the virtues characterizing what the 7th century sage Sun Simiao termed the \"Great Physician.\" A first-year series of courses teaching palpation and perception skills lays the foundation for hands-on clinical skill training that is threaded throughout the rest of the curriculum. Multicultural awareness is emphasized in the \"Introduction to Clinic\" class that happens in the spring of the first year, before students start their Observation Rotations. Students refine their awareness of qi flow by engaging in the \"nourishing life\" practices of the Jinjing Gong lineage, one of China's authentic alchemical life science traditions. A series of nine qigong weekly practicums and weekend retreats are held during the first three years of the program. The retreat centers are in ancient forest, mountain and hot-springs settings. Qi cultivation continues in the fourth year with three taiji practicums and an elective retreat. Students are encouraged to start the series earlier if desired. There are two practitioner cultivation courses: the first focuses on self-reflection and personal goals/challenges; the second on patient-practitioner dynamics. Recognizing that development into a thriving business person can be an integral element of cultivation, the business and ethics training and community education opportunities are incorporated into all four years of the curriculum. In the classical texts electives, students learn to read and translate the texts using a process involving much more than the straight-forward acquisition of factual knowledge. Deciphering the rich, multilayered fields of meaning embedded in the pictographic characters builds a kind of cognitive capacity that transcends Western rational, dualistic thought. This new way of knowing enriches the clinical experience immeasur - ably, and helps build the capacity to perceive precisely what is possible in each unique clinical encounter. CCM offers a multitude of additional cultivation electives, including courses in such subjects as calligraphy, shiatsu, classical tea arts, bazi suanming, Yijing , weiqi (a form of Chinese chess), Confucian Five-Element emotional healing and others. Although such courses are rarely included in modern Chinese medicine programs in China or the West, they provide extremely valuable tools and opportunities for cultivation, and connect students with the milieu of the ancient sage-practitioner. Master of Science in Oriental Medicine | ncnm.edu 58 The Master of Science in Oriental Medicine is a four-year program consisting of 3,414 hours and 220.5 credits. Students are immersed in the classical foundations of the medicine, receive a holistic education in Western medical sciences, and are trained in the clinical application of the major modalities of acupuncture, moxibustion, herbal formulation, bodywork, qigong and nutrition. The curriculum emphasizes personal and professional cultivation in order to support the health of students as they progress through school, and to optimize their proficiency as practitioners. Many elective courses are available, and certificate programs exist for advanced study in the areas of qigong and shiatsu. MSOM Goals Instruct healthcare practitioners in the art and science of Chinese medicine Immerse students in the culture of Chinese medicine by combining emphasis on scholarly erudition and attention for multi-layered detail with the \"atmosphere\" inspiring aspects of holistic life science Cultivate respect for Chinese medicine as an independent science that has its own parameters and does not require validation by other scientific systems Honor the philosophical precepts that are shared by naturopathic medicine and classical Chinese medicine\u2014belief in the healing power of nature, focus on identifying the root causes of disease, and treatment of the person as a multifaceted entity Foster awareness of the historical development of Chinese medicine, including knowledge of the major schools of Chinese medical thought Present Chinese medicine as a renaissance-style art that is embedded in, and closely related to, other traditional arts and sciences Educate students to effectively treat disease, especially chronic and recalcitrant disorders, by training them broadly in all major modalities of Chinese medicine while at the same time effecting them to acquire a distinguishing sense regarding the clinical situation under which each of the relevant modalities should be appliedMSOM Educational Objectives Diagnose according to the traditional parameters of Chinese diagnosis Master the theory and practice of the main modalities of Chinese medicine Acquire a distinguishing sense regarding the clinical situations under which each of the relevant modalities should be applied Engage in scholarly discourse regarding the nature and origin of Chinese medicine Work cooperatively with other healthcare practitioners for optimal patient care Licensing and Certification of Acupuncturists and Oriental Medicine Practitioners Graduates of the MSOM program are eligible to apply for acupuncture licensure in the state of Oregon, and are eligible to take all exams administered by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM), which most states use as a basis for licensure.

Each week students are presented with three actual cases to analyze outside of class. Students analyze a patient's signs and symptoms, arrive at a diagnosis and treatment plan, and then devise a point prescription complete with the rationale for each point. This is presented and debated in class with fellow students and the instructor. Prerequisite: CCM 622, Corequisite: concurrent enrollment in CCM 633 CCM 540 - Auricular Points (1.5 lecture credits) Students are introduced to acupuncture point location by gaining hands-on experience with the most used and researched microsystem in Chinese medicine, the ear. The Chinese system of auricular therapy is presented, along with some French auriculomedicine. The focus is on learning the anatomy of the ear and the identification of acupuncture points that are useful for both diagnosis and treatment. Auricular points are widely used in public health and addiction rehabilitation settings, and can be stimulated with ear acupressure pellets to extend the effect of acupuncture treatments. Master of Science in Oriental Medicine | ncnm.edu 60 CCM 739 - Acu-Moxa Board Review (1 lecture credit) This course is offered during the fall quarter of the final year in preparation for national board exams. The course highlights all essential aspects of acupuncture and Asian medical theory through a series of mock exams, discussion and question/answer sessions. Prerequisite: CCM 633 Acu-Moxa Techniques This series of courses focuses on developing diagnostic and treatment skills. The format is typically a combination of lecture and demonstration, followed by a practice session in which students work on each other under the observation and guidance of experienced supervisors. These hands-on classes are designed to develop the fundamental technical skills needed to function in a clinical setting. Techniques I-III constitute the first year, Techniques IV-VI the second. In a third-year series of classes, students refine their needling techniques, and learn additional adjunctive therapies, including guasha, cupping, bleeding and teishin. CCM 513/523 - Acu-Moxa Techniques I, II (Point Location) (2 lecture credits each)These two courses focus on learning to accurately locate all of the standard points on the 14 primary channels using the Chinese system of anatomical measurement, as well as a cultivated ability to directly perceive the points. Students contemplate and meditate on a specific channel, and then practice locating it on their classmates. The focus is on the development of skills that will bring clinical success and patient satisfaction. Classical approaches from source texts are integrated into the class. Corequisite for CCM 513: concurrent enrollment in CCM 512 (Pts I); Prerequisites for CCM 523: CCM 512 and 513 (Pts and Tech I); Corequisite: concurrent enrollment in CCM 522 (Pts II)CCM 533 - Acu-Moxa Techniques III (3 lecture credits)Needle insertion skill is the focus of this course. Nearly 100 different points from the 14 primary channels are used in hands-on practice that emphasizes painless, freehand needle insertion, careful needle advancement, and finding/obtaining the qi. Appropriate positioning of the patient and proper alignment of one's own body are also covered. Students practice on each other, and learn to attend to patient concerns and reactions while soliciting feedback. Students learn to palpate and apply indication specific acupressure and cupping techniques to the front mu and back shu points, and learn the location and functions of commonly used extra points. Prerequisite: CCM 523, Corequisite: concurrent enrollment in CCM 532 CCM 613 - Acu-Moxa Techniques IV (3 lecture credits) Building on the skills learned in Acu-Moxa Techniques III, students apply different technical patterns, and simple and complex tonifying-reducing techniques as indicated for specific syndromes and constitutional types. Students become flexible in their use of various needling techniques, and are encouraged to develop their own needling styles. Note: The Clean Needle Technique course offered by the CCAOM is also required. Prerequisite: CCM 533, CCM 612 - Acu-Moxa Techniques V (3 lecture credits) Needling practice continues with a focus on more challenging points and learning to manipulate qi according to traditional methods of tonification and dispersion (bu & xie). Another 100 points are chosen from all parts of the body to familiarize the student with a wide range of points and needling experience. Prerequisite: CCM 613, Corequisite: concurrent enrollment in CCM 622 CCM 633 - Acu-Moxa Techniques VI (3 lecture credits) This course focuses on perfecting diagnostic skills, as well as treatment planning and implementation. In class, 2014-2015 Catalog | Master of Science in Oriental Medicine 61 each student takes a fellow student's case. After discussing the diagnosis and treatment plan with an instructor, the student proceeds to administer the treatment. Attention is given to the orchestration of the entire process and to the subtleties of working with real people. The techniques of scalp and electro-acupuncture are also introduced. Note: Techniques IV-VI include a qigong component in the belief that good acupuncture is dependent on the practitioner's awareness of, and sensitivity to, qi. Prerequisite: CCM 623, Corequisite: concurrent enrollment in CCM 632 CCM 712/720 - Advanced Acu-Moxa Techniques I, II (1 lecture credit with 0.5 lab credit each)In these two courses, students refine their hand-skill and acupuncture technique, and learn a variety of additional adjunct therapies, including different styles of moxibustion, cupping, guasha, bleeding and teishin. Referencing knowledge gained in the concurrent clinical medicine courses, students learn to assess which techniques and modalities to select for optimal clinical benefit in different clinical scenarios. Prerequisite: CCM 663 Elective: CCM 547E - Extra Points (1 lecture credit) In this elective course, students learn the location and actions of the most commonly used 87 extra points, including the World Health Organization and NCCAOM lists of extra points. These points are very useful in clinical practice. Elective: CCM 515E/525E - Microsystems I, II (1 lecture credit with 0.5 lab credit each)This two course series introduces the ancient approach to understanding how microsystems within the body relate to and inform the practitioner about the whole person. In classical acupuncture texts, microsystems were used for diagnosis, while in contemporary practice they are also used in treatment. Through application of the microsystems approach, the practitioner is often able to make sense of seemingly random events in the body, and to use each part of the body to produce powerful effects in the whole.Elective: CCM 518E/528E - Embodied Acupuncture I, II (1 lecture credit with 0.5 lab credit each)In this two course sequence, students explore styles of acupuncture beyond the standard Chinese approach. Included will be modern and neoclassical styles that utilize both deep and gentle needling. A key focus in the classroom will be the development of the palpatory sensitivity needed to excel at acupuncture. Basic and Western Clinical Sciences BAS 434 - Evidence-Informed Practice (2 lecture credits)Upon completion of this course, students will be able to read medical research material and critically assess clinical studies. CCM 554 - CCM View of Biomedicine (1 lecture credit) The content of this weekend seminar includes a comparison of Eastern and Western epistemology, and a discussion of how the information in the upcoming biomedicine series can be viewed from the perspective of CCM. It will also include a consideration of how insights gained from the classical texts of Chinese medicine can illuminate the understanding of modern scientific discoveries, and vice versa. CCM 417/427/437/554/556/557 - Biomedicine I-VI (4 lecture credits each, except for CCM 427 which is 2 lecture credits)This course series, which starts in the second year of the program, introduces students of Chinese medicine to the biomedical approach to health and illness. Following an overview of foundational concepts of organic chemistry, biochemistry and cell biology, students learn the anatomy, biochemistry and physiology of the major body structures, organs and systems, together with an overview of their known pathologies. Students will learn the basic pathophysiological mechanisms of disease as understood through the biomedical perspective, and will develop an understanding of important laboratory markers, Master of Science in Oriental Medicine | ncnm.edu 62 diagnostic imaging and clinical findings relevant to each system discussed. In addition, pertinent pharmacological and microbiological concepts will be discussed. Through quizzes, class discussion, and case studies, students will develop the ability to integrate biomedical and classical Chinese medical concepts regarding disease processes, and to view biomedical knowledge from the perspective of whole-systems science. The goal of this course series is to enable students of Chinese medicine to cultivate a broad understanding of conventional biomedical sciences, which will be useful in their future clinical training. Prerequisites: these courses need to be taken in the assigned sequence CCM 546 - Clinical and Physical Diagnosis Laboratory (1 lab credit) In this course, students learn to perform and interpret basic integrative physical examinations of the major body systems.

CCM 636 - Applied Palpation and Perception (1 lecture credit with 0.5 lab credit)In this pre-internship course, students continue to refine their palpation and bodywork skills, and learn how to apply them clinically. Prerequisite: CCM 438 Shiatsu Acupressure Massage The shiatsu series presents a thorough grounding in the principles and style of Asian bodywork, the energetic anatomy upon which it is based, and the fundamentals of touching with quality. Students learn a variety of techniques and maneuvers in the context of a complete, full-body massage. This style of shiatsu is highly effective and enjoyable to give as well as receive. Though shiatsu is a Japanese word and massage tradition, it derives from Chinese sources and is based on the same theories and principles that have influenced the entire pan-Asian approach to medicine. Shiatsu I-III can be taken early in the Chinese medicine program to more fully prepare students for what they will learn in the Points and Techniques series. These courses present shiatsu as a holistic massage focusing on wellness, and do not require the ability to diagnose in order to be effective. Shiatsu is a complete modality on its own, but also trains the student in the art of palpation and general sensitivity, which is useful in all aspects of a medical practice. Elective: CCM 991E - Shiatsu I, Back of the Body (1.5 lab credits) Shiatsu I is an introductory course, presenting two of the cornerstones of Asian/Japanese massage, shiatsu and Do-In (a self-massage routine (Dao Yin in Chinese)). Neither massage uses oil nor requires disrobing. This course presents traditional Asian style massage on a table and teaches the back half of the body. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour to perform. An emphasis is placed on learning the proper alignment and body position for the practitioner, and on memorizing and internalizing the sequence (kata/form) of the massage. Students are exposed to the energetic, theoretical and technical aspects of shiatsu. Theory focuses on learning the channel pathways. Instruction emphasizes kinesthetic learning, alternating between demonstration and practice. Open to all NCNM students. Elective: CCM 997E - Shiatsu II Short Form, Front of the Body (1.5 lab credits)Shiatsu II is the continuation of Shiatsu I, teaching the second half of the short form. In terms of the kata it covers the front of the body. The front of the body also takes about 45 minutes to do. This course continues the Do-In (Dao-Yin) training with an emphasis on being able to teach it to others. The last part of the course combines the back of the body from Shiatsu I with the front learned in this term to complete the 'short form.' The whole shiatsu short form takes about an hour and a half to perform and constitutes a very thorough and satisfying massage for both the giver and the receiver. Prerequisite: CCM 991E 2014-2015 Catalog | Master of Science in Oriental Medicine 69 Elective: CCM 998E - Shiatsu III Short Form, lab credit)Shiatsu III, the short-form practicum, integrates the material learned in Shiatsu I and II. In a mock clinical approach to classroom learning, students bring a different volunteer client to class each week to give them a shiatsu massage. The instructor circulates and provides individualized feedback during each session. The short form constitutes the basic framework for the clinical practice of shiatsu, and by the end of the term the student should be capable of performing it professionally in about an hour and a quarter. Prerequisite: CCM 997E Elective: CCM 805E - Shiatsu IV Long Form, Back of the Body (1.5 lab credits)The long form builds on the short form learned in the first year and introduces new techniques. Specifically, stretching maneuvers for all the major joints of the body, along with more specific pressing of acu-points, are integrated into the massage. Pertaining to the self-cultivation aspect of the training, another Dao-Yin form is presented. This term the students learn a comprehensive series of stretches, much like yoga, for the practitioner, both as preparation to give as well as receive the shiatsu stretches, but also to generally open and strengthen the practitioner's body. Intimate knowledge of these stretches also constitutes the basis for the use of stretches as a prescription for clients. Prerequisite: CCM 998E Elective: CCM 806E - Shiatsu V Long Form, Front of the Body (1.5 lab credits)Shiatsu V continues where Shiatsu IV left off, covering the long-form kata for the front half of the body. This course completes the very thorough whole-body treatment, which takes two to three hours to perform. Again, stretches and specific point work are integrated into the kata. Useful for both assessment and treatment, the long form is a comprehensive and satisfying massage. Prerequisite: CCM 805E Elective: CCM 807E (1.5 lab credits)Shiatsu VI is the long-form practicum. Students bring a volunteer client into the classroom to perform a long-form treatment on them. The instructor circulates providing guidance and feedback. Students work on solving their technical difficulties, generally refine their massage technique, and hone their theoretical understanding, while developing their capacity to relate to their clients and discuss shiatsu in a professional manner. Some diagnostic palpation is practiced focusing on shu and mu points. Opportunities for improvisation from amongst the myriad of techniques become necessary to keep the treatment to a reasonable length of time. These processes train the student to tailor their treatments in real world settings to their clients' individual needs and limits within the context of the shiatsu kata, while the kata provides the basis for a consistent product/service that ensures continuity between sessions and across providers. Prerequisite: 806E Research Elective: CCM 992E - Master's Thesis Research and Writing in Chinese Medicine (1 lecture credit)This course provides training in CCM scholarship, and prepares students to write a master's thesis during the final year of the program. Students get support in choosing and refining the focus of their thesis, which may be on any approved topic pertinent to classical Chinese medicine. By the end of the course, students have produced an abstract and a preliminary outline of their thesis, and received guidance in choosing a thesis committee. Details of the thesis process are described in the \"MSOM Thesis Information Packet\" provided in the course. Traditional Arts of Cultivation Chinese Cultural Arts: Chinese Calligraphy Chinese calligraphy is an ancient and elegant art form that originated with the ancient Chinese shamans known as the Wu. Calligraphy is the traditional Wu's way of accessing the universal qi for healing and creating harmonizing feng shui energy. Shamans have used brushes to express their healing power for thousands of years in China. Calligraphy is still used as a tool for cultivating inner knowledge and to understand the roots of classical Chinese medicine. Elective: CCM 972E - Chinese Calligraphy I (1 lab credit) Students first learn how to use the basic tools of calligraphy, namely brush, ink and paper.

This form is a 17th century refinement of the more broadly known Yijin Jing (Change the Sinews System of Exercises) from the Shaolin Tradition. In addition, students gain experience teaching the shaking, walking, quiet meditation, and long forms learned in the previous modules, and develop expertise in the therapeutic prescription of qigong regimen for individual patients. Prerequisites: Retreat CCM 759 - Qigong IX Practicum (1 lecture credit with 0.75 lab credit)This qigong module serves to deepen and assess each student's level of mastery of the performance and therapeutic application of the qigong practices covered in the previous eight modules. Prerequisites: CCM 724/758 Elective: CCM 603E/604E/605E Qigong I-III (2 lecture credits each)In this elective series, students are mentored in the use of qigong prescriptions as a therapeutic modality. Working under close supervision by qualified practitioners of the Jinjing Gong lineage, each student develops and delivers individualized treatment protocols for patients referred to the class. Prerequisite: completion of Qigong I-IX Retreats and Qigong I-IX Practicums Qigong Teaching Series This series is designed for students admitted into the Qigong Teaching Certificate Program. Elective: CCM 740E/741E/742E - Teaching Qigong I-III Practicum (0.75 lab credits each)This advanced elective series is designed for the serious qigong student who wishes to continue formal training in qigong and integrate the teaching of qigong into their clinical practice. Prerequisite: completion of Qigong I-IX Retreats and Qigong I-IX Practicums Taiji Taiji Quan (T'ai Chi Ch'uan) literally means \"the very pinnacle, highest, or greatest fist,\" i.e., martial art. A more useful translation might be \"the ultimate exercise.\" Its precisely choreographed movements create a relaxing mind-body dance that stretches and strengthens the entire body. Its slow, deliberate moves develop balance and grace. Its meditative style facilitates harmonious breathing and a focused mind. It is, in short, meditation in motion. There are many variations within the world of taiji. Yang style taiji is the most commonly practiced style in both China and the U.S. Within styles there are various practice lengths, loosely divided into long and short forms. Here, the focus is on a long form. This form takes around 30-40 minutes to perform and thus also takes some time to learn. The three sections of the long form are divided neatly into the three terms of the academic year. Thus, the first year of study is devoted to learning the sequence of moves along with the principles of movement that accompany them and an inward-looking focus that emphasizes the cultivation of qi within the student. From a Chinese medical perspective, taiji harmonizes the \"three treasures,\" jing, qi and shen (essence, energy and spirit). Each class includes specially designed warm-up exercises, qigong, and detailed instruction in the form. The first year of study focuses on learning the sequence of movements and the correct way of doing each move. Taiji I is required in the fourth year of the MSOM program. However, students are encouraged to take it sooner if they wish to take full advantage of the taiji elective series. The taiji courses are open to all NCNM students. CCM 815/964/965 - Taiji I-III Practicum (0.75 lab credit each) The first section, which is the subject of Taiji I, teaches all the basic moves and principles and thus constitutes an effective short form that can be practiced on its own. Subsequent courses build on the foundation, emphasizing deepening awareness through the practice of the form. At NCNM, our instructors focus more on the health and spiritual cultivation attributes of taiji as opposed to its martial arts aspects. In this context these courses are effective and enjoyable for anyone who enjoys movement arts or exercise. At the same time taiji is very meditative, one of the reasons people like to practice taiji, and indeed many find this moving meditation preferable to sitting meditation. Elective: CCM 966E/967E/968E - Taiji IV-VI Practicum (0.75 lab credit each)The second year of taiji consists of elective classes that pick up at the completion of the long-form sequence and focus on practicing the Taiji quan. Having learned the sequence of moves, the next steps have to do with refining and perfecting the form through practice over time. Each term, and indeed each class, focuses on a different aspect of practice until the form is thoroughly integrated and the student is confident in the ability to practice alone. Elective: CCM 814E - Taiji Retreat (1 credit) In this weekend retreat, students are introduced to the history, principles, and practice of taiji. A classical approach will be used to enable students to understand and experience that taiji is a healing tool capable of playing a critical role in the prevention of disease and the nourishment of life.Master of Science in Oriental Medicine | ncnm.edu 72 Traditional Mentorship Tutorial CCM 981/982/989 - Traditional Mentorship Tutorial I-III (2 lecture credits each)A hallmark of the MSOM program, the tutorial classes are designed to facilitate direct and personal contact between students and instructors, and thereby the culture and lineage system of a classical Chinese medicine education.

Prerequisite: these courses are designed to be taken in sequence Elective Requirement Students are required to take six credits of elective courses as part of their core program.Clinical Training Overview The clinical training objectives of the MSOM program are aligned with the overall mission of training competent practitioners in the art and science of classical Chinese medicine. The clinical aspect is expected to be a refinement of the knowledge base acquired in the academic portion of the program, with the implicit understanding that many important skills can only be attained in an applied context of a practical learning situation. These skills include, but are not limited to: Development of foundational knowledge and understanding of classical Chinese medical concepts and techniques Evolution of interpersonal communication abilities Refinement of problem-solving capacities and clinical judgment Proficiency in executing the technical skills required to effectively apply treatments in Chinese medicine Before clinical observation occurs, students receive training in Chinese diagnostic techniques, as well as in the theory and philosophy of classical Chinese medi - cine. Before clinical internship commences, students develop their interpersonal skills and diagnostic abilities, and receive further training in point actions, needling technique and the Chinese herbal formulary. The content and sequence of the academic courses are designed to accomplish this goal. To begin the first-year of the Observation component, students must successfully complete all first-year courses including the Introduction to Clinic class, in which clinic policies and procedures are reviewed. The second year of Observation requires successful completion of all prerequisite courses from the second year of study. Internship begins after successful completion of all third-year courses, Observation shifts, and passing of the clinic entrance exams. An Internship orientation is required before beginning the Internship rotations. Students are gradually led through the clinical experience in a sequential fashion, from active observation to being able to conduct a comprehensive patient intake and treatment protocol. In the spirit of the classics, emphasis is placed on recognition of Chinese syndrome pattern differentiation (rather than symptomatic prescribing), with the goal of creating individual treatment plans designed to assist patients in returning to a more harmonious and balanced state. CCM 443 - Introduction to Clinic (1.5 lecture credits) This course introduces students to the fundamentals of working in the CCM clinics. Topics include clinic policies and procedures, hygienic standards, charting, patient confidentiality and multicultural awareness. In addition, students gain confidence in assigning zang-fu pattern differentiation to patient cases. 2014-2015 Catalog | Master of Science in Oriental Medicine 73 Clinical Training The components of the clinical portion of the program are Observation, Internship, Observation Case Presentation and Clinical Case Presentation.

The old adage \"you are what you eat\" has never been more true. The Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN) degree program focuses on diets that are based on whole, unprocessed foods and integrates nutritional biochemistry and pathophysiology with advanced clinical nutrition knowledge. An active-learning curriculum provides a solid foundation in holistic nutrition and food systems, complemented by skill-training in cooking, teaching and nutritional counseling. Nutrition is a dynamic science with new research findings constantly being published. As we continue to learn about the complex relationship between food and human metabolism, there is no argument that whole and minimally processed foods are better for reducing disease risk. Fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds provide us with many beneficial nutrients beyond vitamins and minerals. However, each individual also has their own unique nutritional needs. No one diet is right for everyone. Focusing on each person as an individual allows for variation of dietary needs that provide the best nutritional support possible. Nutrition books are top-sellers, demonstrating that the public wants more information about nutrition. Simultaneously, obesity is at an all-time high and chronic disease continues to rise. This paradox demonstrates that nutrition knowledge is not translating to individuals' ability to make dietary changes. People need help and support to make significant behavioral changes. In order to make nutrition accessible to every individual in every community, we need to embrace a nutritional philosophy that embraces cultural preferences. We need to treat food as medicine. The Master of Science in Nutrition program at NCNM prepares its graduates for a variety of settings including health coaching and nutritional counseling, serving on integrative healthcare teams, personal chef and professional food service consultant, nutrition research, and community nutrition educational programs.

Treatment of illness in Western industrial societies focuses on curing specific diseased organs or controlling a specific virus. In many so-called \"traditional\" societies, greater emphasis is placed on the social and psychological dimensions of illness. In this course students will learn that different cultures, even in the U.S., have different ways to talk about illness, and that the American medical community is at times as Master of Science in Global Health | ncnm.edu 100 \"culture bound\" as anywhere. \"Science\" does not stand outside culture. This course will explore traditional healers, shamans and witch doctors, as well as conventional biomedical physicians. GSGH 712E - Disaster Relief (2 credits) Disaster relief includes response to natural hazards as well as a broad range of human-induced disasters, complex emergencies and crises. Economic globalization and competition for resources has resulted in conflict, displacement and forced migration in certain regions of the world, all of which can be viewed within the lens of disaster relief. This course provides an integrated approach to all stages of disaster management in a comprehensive and holistic manner, including (a) pre-disaster preparedness and mitigation; (b) rescue and relief in the context of disaster; and (c) post-disaster rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery. GSGH 800E - African Herbal Medicine (2 credits) Tanzania is one of the most ethno-botanically diverse countries on the planet. With more than 10,000 species of plants, the soils of Tanzania grow many herbal medicines. Students will work with a traditional healer in Tanga to learn how the herbs are used in the villages. A naturopathic faculty member will be present to discuss Western uses of the herbs and how Western uses relate to the Tanzanian uses. Students also have the opportunity to visit with herbal medicine researchers in Tanzania.GSGH 821E - Global Health Experience (2 credits)In this course, students travel with a faculty member to a foreign country to learn how research and health care is conducted internationally. Country, faculty member and research topic varies. Students are responsible for paying tuition for the course, as well as for their own airfare, food, lodging and visa expenses. GSGH 831E - International Travel Skills (2 credits) This weekend course trains students who plan to travel abroad independently or as part of a course. It covers tropical travel risks and recommendations, travel vaccinations, state department recommendations, waterborne infections, mental health, ethics and cultural competency. GSGH 841E - International Public Health (2 credits) This course provides a daily discussion of public health initiatives with international relevance. It addresses childhood nutrition programs, maternal survival programs, environmental studies, refugee health, water systems and safe water, food systems and health education. This course is currently only offered on global health trips. GSGH 842E - Intro to Tropical Disease (2 credits) This course provides a basic overview of tropical disease in developing nations. Students differentiate between the microbiology, pathology and clinical symptoms of different microbes. Students are exposed to conventional and natural treatments for each disease. This course is currently only offered on global health trips. 2014-2015 Catalog | MScGH Twelve-Month Curriculum 101 COURSE # FALL LAB LECTURE CREDITS GSGH 511 Foundations in Global Health 36 3 GSGH 521 Social and Behavioral Foundations of Health 24 2 RES 503 Principles of Epidemiology 36 3 RES 600 Biostatistics I 24 2 GSGH 510 Global Health Discussion Series 12 1 GSGH 512 Global Health Practicum 12 1 Elective 1 24 2 Elective 2 24 2 Fall Totals 0 192 16 COURSE # WINTER LAB LECTURE CREDITS RES 601 Biostatistics II 36 3 RES 630 Public Health Policy 24 2 GSGH 522 Global Health Seminar 24 2 GSGH 523 Global Health Programs: Design and Evaluation 24 2 GSGH 510 Global Health Discussion Series 12 1 GSGH 512 Global Health Practicum 12 1 Elective 3 24 2 Elective 4 24 2 Winter Totals 0 180 15 COURSE # SPRING LAB LECTURE CREDITS GSGH 630 Global Health Field Work 192 0 8 Elective 5 24 2 Elective 6 24 2 Elective 7 24 2 Spring Totals 192 72 14 Total Core Course Credits 31 Total Elective Course Credits 14 TOTAL REQUIRED CREDITS 192 444 45 COURSE # SUMMER - OPTIONAL LAB LECTURE CREDITS Optional summer trip consists of the following electives: GSGH 821E Global Health Experience 24 2 GSGH 831E International Travel Skills 24 2 RES 841E Introduction to International Public Health 24 2 RES 842E Introduction to Tropical Disease 24 2 Summer Totals 0 84 7core classesMScGH TWELVE-MONTH CURRICULUMMScGH Electives | ncnm.edu 102 COURSE # COURSE TITLE LAB LECTURE CREDITS GSN 504 Food Policy 24 2 GSN 525 Cultural and Traditional Diets 24 2 GSN 545E Global Cusine 24 2 GSN 544E Global and Ecological Food Issues 24 2 GSGH 703E Maternal and Child Health 24 2 GSGH 704E Leadership Development in Global Health 24 2 GSGH 706E Conference in Global Health 12 1 GSGH 707E Qualitative Data Analysis and Mixed Methods 24 2 GSGH 708E Ethnography 24 2 GSGH 709E Policy Studies and Analysis 24 2 GSGH 710E Medical Anthroplogy 24 2 GSGH 712E Disaster Relief 24 2 GSGH 800E African Herbal Medicine 24 2 GSGH 821E Global Health Experience 24 2 GSGH 831E International Travel Skills 24 2 GSGH 841E International Public Health 24 2 GSGH 842E Intro to Tropical Disease 24 2 RES 538 Medical Academic 24 2 RES 611 Grant Writing 24 2 RES 625 Nutrition Research and Skills 24 2 RES 802E Health Disparities and Diversity 24 2 RES 805E Environmental Medicine 24 2 RES 832E Vaccinations 24 2electivesMScGH ELECTIVES 14 Credits Required 2014-2015 Catalog | Academic Policies 103 Academic Policies Registration The Office of the Registrar will notify students regarding registration details. All continuing students are registered for the upcoming academic year's fall classes by the end of spring quarter. Students may attend only the specific course sections for which they are registered. Non-adherence to this policy will result in no credit for the course. Students will not be registered for courses, labs or clinic shifts that occur at overlapping times. Credit will be earned for only one course during any given segment of time. All changes in courses and sections must be made through the Office of the Registrar. Students who wish to register for less than the full-time curriculum must receive written approval from the program dean. No student may add or begin classes after the end of the second week of any quarter. Eligibility to Register A non-degree seeking student is someone who is not a matriculated NCNM student, or is matriculated into the School of Research & Graduate Studies. Persons who wish to attend a course as a non-degree seeking student must make application through the Office of Admissions. Approval is based upon space availability and meeting prerequisite requirements. Graduates of accredited NCNM programs may apply for entry into certificate programs offered at NCNM, provided they meet the specific requirements. Practitioners seeking continuing education units (CEUs) should contact the Office of Advancement. Credit Hour Policy Credits will be awarded based upon hours of instruction. NCNM is on a quarter system. Quarter credits for coursework are awarded according to the following: 12 Lecture Hours = 1 credit 24 Laboratory Hours = 1 credit24 Clinical Hours = 1 credit Challenge Examinations NCNM policy allows an individual to challenge by examination the content of a required course. Applicants who have been accepted may request to challenge a course prior to matriculation. This option is only available to students who have appropriately documented prior graduate coursework and there is a question as to whether or not the information covered sufficiently meets NCNM requirements. Transfer credit policies and course descriptions are outlined in the college catalog and are available from the Office of Admissions. There must be a difference in hours between a transfer course and the college's course and/or a question of equivalency of material covered in order for a challenge exam to be given. After the challenge exam has been administered, the grade is recorded and the student is notified of the results. If the student fails the exam, he/she must register for the course and pay the appropriate tuition. To be considered for a challenge exam, the student must: Complete transfer credit review during the admissions process to identify which courses may be eligible for challenge. Students who are applying for transfer credit reviews must sign the \"NCNM Transfer of Credit Agreement\" form upon admission to the college. Transfer credits will not be considered after matriculation. Submit a \"Transfer/Challenge Exam\" form obtained from the registrar, and submit this to the associate dean of academic progress and the instructor (to which the challenge exam is related) for approval. Once permission is obtained, the associate dean of academic progress will facilitate arrangements for the student to take the challenge exam. Pay the appropriate fees and submit an \"Exam\" form, located in the Faculty Support Office, to the instructor before taking the exam. See the Financial Policies section for information on fees. Take the challenge exam prior to the offering of the course that is being challenged; with the exam taken, graded, and the grade submitted to the registrar no fewer than two weeks prior to the start of the quarter in which the course is offered. *The following statement is for veteran students inquiring about prior credit: Any veteran receiving GI Bill benefits while attending NCNM is required to obtain transcripts from all previously attended schools and submit them to the VA School Official for review of prior credit. Auditing Students may audit a lecture course, space allowing, if they have met the prerequisites, have obtained the instructor's consent, and have registered for the course. The course will appear on the student's official transcript as an audit. Classes taken as an audit must be declared by the end of the quarter's second week. Audited courses are not eligible for challenge exams. See the Financial Policies section for information on fees.Academic Policies | ncnm.edu 104 Attendance and Tardiness In order to maintain educational standards, NCNM expects one hundred percent (100%) attendance at classes and clinical rotations. Faculty members may exercise discretion on attendance, as well as require students to attend up to one hundred percent (100%) of scheduled classes in order to pass a course. Students should consult course syllabi for additional details on individual faculty attendance expectations. Students may not miss more than two clinic shifts within a given clinic rotation. Instructors may take into account habitual tardiness when calculating a course or clinic grade. Students are responsible for being aware of and meeting faculty attendance expectations. Grading and Promotion NCNM maintains high standards of scholarship, and at the same time recognizes its responsibility to provide each student the best opportunity to complete the program successfully. At the beginning of each course, the instructor is required to define clearly for class members the objectives of the course and the standards and methods by which student achievement will be measured. Students are responsible for checking their grades online in SONIS.For students enrolled in the ND or MSOM programs, at the end of each course, each student's performance is reported to the registrar using the following grading system: H (HONORS): superior performance; equivalent to \"A,\" not available for all courses P (PASS): satisfactory performance; equivalent to \"B\" or \"C\" FR (FAIL REMEDIATE): marginal performance (temporary (REMEDIATED equivalent to \"C-\" F (FAILURE): unsatisfactory performance (permanent grade); equivalent to \"F\" I (INCOMPLETE): course requirements not yet completed (temporary grade) W (WITHDRAWAL): student withdrew from course WF (WITHDRAWAL FAILING): student withdrew from course while failing AU (AUDIT) CMP (COMPLETE): used for courses that are not graded, but attendance is required or a specified number of hours need to be completed 2014-2015 Catalog | Academic Policies 105 T (TRANSFER): course received approved transfer credit. Transfer credit does not apply toward overall GPA calculation NC (NOT COMPLETED): hour requirement or attendance not met IP (IN PROGRESS) For students enrolled in programs within the School of Research & Graduate Studies, at the end of each course, each student's performance is reported to the registrar using the following grading system: A (SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE) B (SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE) C (MARGINAL PERFORMANCE): passing D (UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE): not passing F (FAILURE): not passing, permanent grade I (INCOMPLETE): course requirements not yet completed (temporary grade) T (TRANSFER): course received approved transfer credit. Transfer credit does not apply toward overall GPA calculation W (WITHDRAWAL): student withdrew from course AU (AUDIT) IP (IN PROGRESS) Grade point averages for students in the School of Research & Graduate Studies will be calculated using the following chart: Grade Points Grade Points A 4.00 C 2.00 A- 3.70 C- 1.70 B+ 3.30 D+ B 3.00 D 1.00 B- 2.70 D- 0.70 C+ 2.30 Grade of \"FR\"\"FR\" (fail remediate) is a temporary grade. Students who fail a course may receive an \"FR\" grade rather than an \"F\" (fail) if, in the judgment of the instructor, it is likely that the student could pass the course by successfully taking a remediation exam. In order to have the \"FR\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus. The \"FR\" grade is given at faculty discretion and should only be given to students who are very close to passing (within 1-10 points on a 100 point scale). Students who receive two or more \"FR\" grades (regardless of whether they have been changed to \"RP\") will be placed on academic probation, and must sign an academic contract. Students earning three or more \"FR\" grades (regardless of whether they have been changed to \"RP\") will be required to appear before the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC), and may be suspended. An \"FR\" grade that has not been remediated by the end of the second week of the following term (for a spring term course by the end of the third week of summer term) will automatically be changed to an \"F.\" Some courses do not lend themselves to this approach, and it is at the discretion of the instructor whether they use this grade. \"FR\" may only be converted to \"RP\" or \"F;\" not to \"P\" or \"H.\" Grades of \"FR\" are not eligible for grade appeals. Grade of \"RP\" Students who pass the remediation exam will earn a permanent grade of \"RP\" (remediated pass). Grade of \"F\" When a student receives a failing grade in a required course (including clinical rotation), the course/clinic rotation must be repeated the next time it is offered, usually the next year. The student is prohibited from continuing in any courses for which the failed course is a prerequisite. The student will repeat the course at the current per-credit rate. Any naturopathic student failing a clinical rotation will be required to register for and attend skills-building. Academic Policies | ncnm.edu 106 Grade of \"I\" A grade of \"I\" (incomplete) is given when a student has satisfactorily completed a minimum of 80% of the course and its requirements, but is unable to complete the course during the term the course is offered. The student must petition the faculty for an incomplete grade by submitting a \"Petition for an Incomplete\" form. Incomplete grades should only be issued in the case of illness, bereavement, or circumstances beyond the student's control. Incomplete grades should be given only if the student has an approved absence excuse issued by the Office of the Associate Dean of Academic Progress. A student receiving an \"I\" grade is responsible for completing the course requirements as specified by the instructor, and for seeing that the registrar receives proper notification of the grade change. Whenever possible, the student is encouraged to sit in on the remaining classes and finish the necessary grading requirements by the second week of the term they return. A grade of incomplete that is not converted to a passing grade by the specified deadline will automatically become a grade of \"F.\" Under extenuating circumstances, an instructor may extend the deadline for an incomplete grade by notifying the registrar, in writing, of the extension and provide a date by which the grade must be resolved; an extension may be no longer than one year, after which time it will convert to a failing grade. If the grade of \"I\" is due to on-going illness, and cannot be made up by the deadline, the student will be required to take a medical leave of absence for the quarter and will be allowed to complete the course material upon return from medical leave. Students who apply for a leave of absence and have not completed 80% of the course work will receive a grade of \"W\" for the class and will need to repeat it upon return from leave. A withdrawal will affect the student's ability to continue in certain course sequences in subsequent quarters. Any student who is failing the course after week eight (8) is not eligible to request an incomplete and will receive a grade of \"WF.\" Grade of \"CMP\" This grade (complete) is used for courses that the student is required to attend, but for which no evaluation is given. Examples of such courses include, but may not be limited to, community education for which the student is required to complete a certain number of hours. Grade of \"IP\" When a faculty member does not turn in grades by a given deadline a student will receive a grade of \"IP,\" meaning \"in progress.\" Once the faculty member submits the grades, the \"IP\" grade will be changed to the appropriate rating. College Advising Upon entering NCNM, each student is assigned an advisor (or mentor for the MSiMR program) by the associate dean of academic progress. Faculty advisors include all full-time faculty and a select group of administrative faculty members. College advisors/mentors are ongoing contacts for their assigned students throughout the duration of the student's enrollment. College advisors/mentors facilitate a connection to the institution, ensure that students understand general academic policies and procedures, serve as a student advocate, and assist in general student support. Advisors/mentors assist students by referring them to appropriate 2014-2015 Catalog | Academic Policies 107 staff and other resources. They are also a point of contact for other faculty to register any concerns and, when needed, serve as a starting point for a college response. Advisors/mentors are required to meet with their first- year advisees early in the academic year and then on an as-needed basis. Advisors/mentors have an advisor handbook which is updated annually to help guide the student appropriately. Academic advising is managed and administered by the associate dean of academic progress. MSiMR students are assigned a research faculty mentor upon enrollment. Faculty mentor assignment is based on research and career interests, and serves to support student project progression and accountability. Faculty mentors assist students with understanding how projects fit into the larger research scopes, as well as publication possibilities. MSiMR students are enrolled in a research practicum course every term until the completion of the program. Faculty mentors serve on defense committees. Academic Advising The associate dean of academic progress administers academic advising for all students. Guidance is available to assist in creating a personal timetable for students on an extended program, and for academic and professional progress. Although students are not required to consult with an advisor/mentor, students who are not making satisfactory academic progress must consult with their program's associate dean. Faculty advisors/mentors are notified in writing when a student they have been advising/mentoring has been placed on academic probation or has a sanction imposed on them for nonacademic behavior. The faculty advisor/mentor is expected to contact the student concerning the issues to ensure that the student is accessing available assistance. Students who are pursuing any track other than the standard published tracks must confer with the associate dean of academic progress to ensure all requirements are met. The associate dean of academic progress is responsible for advising students on the following: Academic probation Changing tracks (four- to five-year, etc.) Academic aspects of leaves of absence (regular or medical) Questions regarding concurrent track options Requests for permission to take exams early or late (in extraordinary circumstances only) Grade appeals Petitions for excused absences General questions regarding academic progress and success The associate dean of academic progress is responsible for follow-up with all students on academic probation.Satisfactory Academic Progress Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward a degree in order to continue in the program and to continue to receive federal, state and institutional financial aid. \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" is defined as passing all program requirements within one and one-half (1.5) times the length of the longest published enrolled program, generally between 5-7 years and a minimum of 11 credits each term (excluding summer unless applicable), unless on an approved deviated track. Grades of \"C\" or lower in the School of Research & Graduate Studies, or failure (grades of \"F\") of two (2) or more courses in the ND and CCM programs are considered not making satisfactory academic progress as outlined in section 7.5 of the student handbook. An Academic Progress Committee meets twice per academic term to determine students' academic progress. Students making unsatisfactory academic progress will be referred to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC). Students must enroll in courses per published and/or approved curriculum layouts. A minimum enrollment of one credit is required to maintain student status. Any student who does not enroll in a minimum of one (1) credit each quarter will be considered withdrawn and must re-apply, and will be subject to graduation requirements under the new catalog (this does not apply to standard summer breaks). MSiMR students who have met all graduation requirements, except for MSiMR thesis completion, must register each term for one (1) credit of \"Thesis Completion\" until they have completed their thesis (students will not be aid-eligible at this point); and may take an additional two (2) years to complete their thesis. Failure to register each term for thesis completion will constitute a withdrawal. Students who do not have a thesis requirement, but need to complete clinical hours, check-offs, preceptor hours or other graduation requirements, must register for one (1) credit of \"Graduation Completion\" each term until all graduation requirements are met, with a maximum of two academic terms. Academic Policies | ncnm.edu 108 If a student is not making satisfactory academic progress in a course prior to the end of the term, the faculty member may request the student to access tutoring; and may share concerns with the program dean and/or associate dean of academic progress about classroom attendance, performance on examinations, and any other factors that may impact the student's success in the course. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress in any term will be given a financial aid warning and will be placed on academic probation (see academic probation policy). Financial aid may be reinstated once a contract is signed and the student will be placed on financial aid probation. Students who continue to make unsatisfactory academic progress must appear before the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC). Financial aid will be suspended pending the outcome of the ARAC. Students who are allowed to remain at the institution must sign an academic contract (see academic probation policy). Financial aid may be reinstated once again when a revised contract has been signed, and the student will be placed on financial aid probation until all issues have been resolved. Students who exceed their matriculation deadline of five (5) or seven (7) years, depending on the enrolled program, are considered not to be making satisfactory academic progress and will no longer be eligible for federal financial aid. However, if a student wants to continue their program beyond the deadlines, they will be required to meet with the associate dean of academic progress and program dean to determine if they may continue at NCNM. The associate dean of academic progress and program dean will assess if the student can demonstrate knowledge retention and skills of their program. If it is determined that the student has gaps of knowledge and/or skills, the student will be required to complete additional academic and/or clinical work. Students who elect to continue their program beyond the matriculated deadline will then be matriculated under the college catalog of the year of their extended program, and are subject to the graduation requirements of their program listed in that catalog, and will be required to sign a new academic contract. Academic Probation Students failing any course that is part of their curriculum will be placed on academic probation. When placed on probation, all students must meet with the associate dean of academic progress within one week to sign an academic contract. This agreement will delineate a timetable for repeating failed courses, identify needed resources, and requires that the student not fail any other required courses during the probationary period. Students may not register or receive financial aid until a current academic contract is on file in the Registrar's Office. Students who fail to complete an academic contract will be withdrawn from any courses in which they are currently enrolled. Students are advised to meet with their college advisor(s) to discuss strategies for successful completion of their program. Students are removed from academic probation once any courses or clinic shifts are repeated and passed, and the terms of the academic contract are met. Unsatisfactory Academic Progress Students who fail one course or clinic shift, or receive two or more \"FR\" grades (regardless of whether remediated), will be placed on academic probation as outlined in section 7.4 of the student handbook. Students who earn two (2) or more grades of \"C\" or lower in the School of Research & Graduate Studies, or failure (grades of \"F\"), or drop below full time for more than one term (unless on an approved deviated track), are not making satisfactory academic progress and may be referred to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee. Re-Application and Re-Admissions Policy Students who have been suspended cannot submit an application for re-admission to NCNM for a minimum of one (1) calendar year from time of suspension, unless noted differently in the suspension letter. A suspended student who wishes to apply for re-admission to NCNM must meet one of the following criteria at the time of suspension. 1. The student had a serious illness or medical issue. 2. An event, or series of events, occurred that prohibited the student's academic performance due to high levels of stress. Examples would include a death in the family, divorce or separation from a long-term partner, assault. 3. Documentation of a disability that can be, but has not been previously or reasonably, accommodated. 4. The student experienced any other serious problem that significantly affected academic performance. Documentation may be required to prove that the situation leading to suspension has been remedied. NCNM may impose the following requirements upon re-admission for a student who was academically suspended: 1. Complete remedial work prior to re-admission, repeating some courses and/or clinic shifts. 2. Meet with the associate dean of academic progress to sign and comply with all conditions of an academic contract. 3. Return on academic probation for a minimum of one (1) academic year, and until all previously failed courses have been resolved. A student who was suspended due to conduct violations will return on disciplinary probation upon re-admission for a minimum of one (1) academic year. Students who have withdrawn, either administratively or voluntarily, from NCNM must wait one application cycle to apply for re-admission. Withdrawn students are 2014-2015 Catalog | Academic Policies 109 required to follow the application process as outlined by the Office of Admissions. NCNM may impose one or more of the following requirements for a student who applies for re-admission, and has been separated from NCNM for more than one year: 1. Take an entrance exam prior to entering the clinic to assess skill level. 2. Complete remedial work, which may include repeating some courses and/or clinic shifts. 3. Meet with the associate dean of academic progress to sign and comply with all conditions of an academic contract if on academic probation when withdrawn. The student will remain on academic probation until all previously failed courses have been resolved. Expelled students are ineligible for re-application or re-admission to NCNM. Completing these steps does not guarantee re-admission to NCNM. These are the criteria for consideration for reapplication. Questions regarding this policy may be directed to the director of admissions, the program dean or dean of students. Honor Council The Honor Council is a standing committee composed of faculty, resident, student and staff representation. The committee meets monthly to review written complaints and performance reports referred from the dean of students that reflect failure of a student to maintain behavioral standards according to the Honor Code. Behavior standards include, but are not limited to, honesty, respect, interpersonal skills, deportment and demeanor, learning skills, professional behavior and communication skills. The committee reviews reports which may be submitted by faculty, staff or students. The Honor Council, depending on the nature and severity of the report, may request the dean of students to conduct a code of conduct investigation. The committee does not accept anonymous reports. After reviewing all information, students will meet with the committee to discuss reported problems. The committee makes recommendations to the dean of students, who then makes the final determination and notifies the student, in writing, of the outcome. The dean of students reviews all reports submitted for Honor Council review, and on occasion, may choose to expedite the process and make a determination without submitting the information to the Honor Council for review. An accumulation of non-academic performance reports in a student's file may interfere with a student's progress through the program if it is deemed that the behavior interferes with the student's progress as a developing physician. If the Honor Council determines that the frequency of reports or the seriousness of a report demonstrates a problem, they may recommend that the student be placed on disciplinary probation. Thereafter, any reports forwarded to the Honor Council may serve as a basis for the committee to recommend suspension. Meetings of the Honor Council are not legal proceedings. No attorneys may be present at any meeting of the committee. A student may bring a faculty member or a member of the Office of Student Life for moral support. However, the individual accompanying the student may not participate in the meeting. Academic Policies | ncnm.edu 110 After reviewing a student file, the committee may provide recommendations including, but not limited to, the following to the dean of students: The student is progressing appropriately. No further action is required. A letter of warning outlining policy, with a reminder to adhere to the policy or procedure. The student has areas of deficiency and remedial work may be required. This may include, but is not limited to, counseling, tutoring, meeting with an advisor or mentor, repeated course work, or restricted enrollment in certain courses. A letter of warning may be given. The student does not currently demonstrate the appropriate behaviors, attitudes, skills or knowledge required for the program and is placed on disciplinary probation for behavioral reasons. A student placed on disciplinary probation for behavioral reasons may be required to perform remedial work, which may alter the course of study. In this case, any additional reports forwarded to the committee showing concern may result in suspension from the program. It is recommended that the student be suspended. The committee may provide any additional recommen - dation it believes is suitable to address the issue at hand. Reports and letters outlining decisions made by the Honor Council and/or dean of students are maintained in the student's file in the program dean's office, and the Office of Student Life. Honor Code reports do not affect a student's academic record unless the outcome is suspension or expulsion from NCNM. Generally, copies of reports and letters are maintained in compliance with NCNM's Record Retention Policy. Patient Safety Monitoring Board The purpose of the Patient Safety Monitoring Board (PSMB) is to apply a systematic, objective review process to adverse clinical events, and to provide formative feedback about clinical policies, procedures and educational practices with the goal of improving patient care and clinical quality. The PSMB serves as a sub-committee of the Honor Council. Once a student has been referred to the Honor Council for a clinical violation, the PSMB conducts a root cause analysis using the fishbone/cause and effect method to audit NCNM systems. The information is presented to the Honor Council, which deliberates as to whether there was a patient safety issue, as well as makes recommendations for prevention of future similar problems. Appeal of Academic Suspension A student suspended will have three (3) business days from the date of the sanction notification to submit an intention to appeal to the provost, or the provost's designee, in writing. The student then has seven (7) calendar days to submit the written appeal and supporting documentation to the provost or designee. The written appeal does not provide an opportunity for the committee to re-hear the case. The provost, or the provost's designee, will respond to the written appeal with a final decision, within ten (10) calendar days, based on assessment of the information presented by the dean and the committee, the student, and a review of the investigation process and procedure. An appeal must contain the basis for the appeal limited to one or more of the following issues: Failure of the program dean or the Academic Review and Appeals Committee to follow the procedures set forth in the policy on unsatisfactory academic progress. The sanction is grossly out of proportion/alignment with the offense. Information relevant to the decision that was not available to the committee for consideration at the time of the hearing. The provost may elect to uphold the decision of the dean; reverse the decision; request a different resolution; or refer the case back to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee if there is new information that was previously not available to the ARAC for consideration. Appeal of Honor Council Suspension or Expulsion Students have the right to appeal a suspension or expulsion from NCNM for Honor Code or Code of Conduct violations. Violations of a lesser nature may not be appealed. No adverse action will be taken against 2014-2015 Catalog | Academic Policies 111 a student for registering an appeal in accordance with these policies. Within three (3) business days from the date disciplinary action was levied against the student by the dean of students, the student must notify the provost (or designee) of intention to appeal. The student will then have seven (7) calendar days to complete and submit to the provost (or designee) a written request for review. The provost or designee will respond with a final decision within ten (10) business days, not including weekends or established holidays, based on assessment of the information provided by the dean of students and the investigation of procedure, or refer the appeal to the Student Appeals Committee. In the unforeseen event the provost or designee needs additional time in reviewing the evidence, the provost or designee will notify the student in writing of the deadline extension. An appeal must contain the basis for the appeal limited to one or more of the following issues: Failure of the dean of students or the Honor Council to follow the procedures set forth in the policy in the student handbook. The sanction is grossly out of proportion/alignment with the offense. Information relevant to the decision that was not available to the committee for consideration at the time of the hearing. The provost (or designee) may elect to uphold the decision of the dean, reverse the decision, or request a different resolution. Examination Schedule Change Students are required to complete all examinations on schedule. In cases of severe illness, bereavement or family emergency, please refer to the policy on Petitioning for Excused Absences in the student handbook. Please also see the Financial Policies section regarding fees. A student may postpone final exams for health reasons no more than twice in their academic career. Need for a third examination deferral requires approval of the associate dean of academic progress. Deferred exams must be taken within three days of the approved excused absence date, and must be scheduled through the specific academic department. After one week from the approved absence date, make-up exams are no longer available. Students who may have a temporary disability that inhibits their attendance and participation in class or clinic should contact the Office of Student Life for an accommodation. An unexcused absence from an examination or major graded exercise will be considered a failure. Graduation Policy Candidates for graduation must: Satisfy all courses in the degree program Satisfy clinic requirements for all medical students If a transfer student, complete at least three (3) years of professional training enrolled as a student at NCNM If a second professional degree student, complete at least two (2) years of professional training enrolled as a student at NCNM Satisfy thesis requirement if applicable to the student's degree program Satisfy all financial obligations to NCNM Only students who have completed all their academic coursework, MSiMR thesis and capstone project, ND case papers, and requisite program clinic hours by the scheduled commencement ceremony date may participate in the ceremony and in taking the oath. They must also have completed the majority of clinical requirements, including preceptorship (ND only) and community Academic Policies | ncnm.edu 112 service. ND students must have taken and passed their GPA III exit exam. MSOM students must have also taken and passed their clinic exit exam. Refer to the student handbook for more detail regarding requirements. MSiMR: Students are required to complete a master's thesis by the middle of the final term of their last year. A master's thesis instruction document is provided to all MSiMR students. A student who anticipates that he/she will be unable to complete required coursework at the time of graduation, and wishes to participate in the commencement ceremo - nies, may petition to participate to the associate dean of academic progress and program dean. Students should submit their request in writing to the program dean's office by the first day of spring term. The student must submit a \"Petition to Participate in Commencement Ceremonies\" form, and should include a list of outstand - ing requirements and a completion plan for finishing during the summer term. A diploma will not be issued to students that petition to participate in commencement ceremonies until all clinical, academic and financial requirements have been met. An ND student is ineligible to take licensing examinations until all required work is completed. \"Petition to Partici - pate in Commencement Ceremonies\" forms are located in the Office of Student Life, Registrar's Office and online. Students who have not completed all requirements may participate in the following year's ceremony Voluntary Leave of Absence Students considering a leave of absence must schedule an appointment with the dean of students. A student in good academic standing may apply for a leave of absence of up to, and no more than, one academic year (four academic terms), which entitles the student to re-enter NCNM during a pre-determined term the following academic year, provided there is space in the class. Students taking less than a full academic year off may not be allowed to continue with a full class load due to sequential courses and missing prerequisites. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track which must be approved by the student's program dean and registrar. The program dean and/or associate dean of academic progress can guide students through a new schedule. The registrar must be advised of a student's intention to return to NCNM within 30 days of intended return, and before the beginning of the quarter in which the student plans to register. The registrar will instruct students to complete and submit a \"Returning Student Notification\" form to the following offices: Registrar, Financial Aid, Business Administration, associate dean of academic progress and Student Life; with the form being returned to the Office of the Registrar when completed. Concurrently enrolled students are not required to take a leave from both programs at the same time, allowing them to remain in one program while on leave from the other program. If a student does not return within one year, the student will be considered administratively withdrawn from the program and will be required to submit a new application for admission. The student will need to satisfy admission requirements in effect at the time of re-application, but may request that the application fee be waived. A leave of absence normally will be granted to any student who is in good standing (i.e., has no outstanding grades of incomplete, fail remediate or failure for required courses, and is not on academic or disciplinary probation), and who has satisfied all financial obligations to NCNM. Students are not allowed to take more than one year (four terms) of absence from NCNM during their academic career. Medical Leave of Absence Students considering a medical leave of absence must schedule an appointment with the dean of students. In the case of a medical leave of absence, which may be granted to a student on academic probation, appropriate documenta - tion is required from the attending physician. The physician must indicate the necessity of granting the leave. A student who is not in good academic standing (i.e., has outstanding grades of incomplete, fail remediate or failure for required courses, or is on academic or disciplinary probation) and is serving in the military will be granted a medical leave of absence without medical documentation. The student must submit documentation from the military branch of his/her time serving. 2014-2015 Catalog | Academic Policies 113 Students who are on a medical leave of absence cannot participate in any academic activities, including remedi - ating incomplete grades or exams; and/or participating in clinical rotation shifts, including preceptor rotations. A student who wishes to return from a medical leave of absence must provide to the dean of students adequate documentation from the attending physician demonstrat - ing the student's fitness for returning to the program. After documentation has been reviewed and accepted by the dean of students, the registrar will be advised of the student's intention to return to NCNM. The advisement of a student's intention to return must be given within 30 days of intended return, and before the beginning of the quarter in which the student plans to register. The registrar will instruct the student to complete and submit a \"Returning Student Notification\" form to the following offices: Registrar, Financial Aid, Business Administration, associate dean of academic progress and Student Life. The form should be returned to the Office of the Registrar when completed. If a student on a medical leave of absence does not return within one year, the student will be considered administratively withdrawn from NCNM and will be required to submit a new application for admission. Any incomplete grades will be converted to a failing grade. The student will need to satisfy admission requirements in effect at the time of re-application, but may request that the application fee be waived. Students are not allowed to take more than one year (four terms) of absence from NCNM during their academic career. Involuntary Leave of Absence This policy is designed to maintain the health and safety of all campus community members. A student may be restricted from campus or subject to an involuntary leave of absence, when, due to a mental, emotional, physical or psychological health disorder, their continued presence at the college poses a significant risk of substantial harm to themselves or others, or is creating a substantial disruption to the educational environment. A significant risk is based upon an individualized assessment and constitutes a high probability of substantial harm which cannot be mitigated by reasonable means. In most situations where a student's medical, psychiatric or psychological condition poses a threat to themselves or to others, the student will be highly encouraged by the dean of students to voluntarily accept a leave of absence (LOA) or medical leave of absence (MLOA). However, if the student does not take such a voluntary leave, the involuntary leave of absence (ILOA) process may commence. If a student has taken actions that are identified as being a significant risk to the health or safety of oneself or other(s), or is creating a substantial disruption to the educational environment, the dean of students, acting on behalf of NCNM and in consultation with the Crisis Assessment and REsponse Team (CARE Team), may initiate the ILOA process as set forth below. The significant risks may include, but are not limited to, acute danger/loss of life, inability to independently manage daily tasks, or inability to cooperate with necessary support services, etc. If the decision is made to place the student on an ILOA, the student is prohibited from participating in any academic or non-academic NCNM activities, including remediating incomplete grades or exams, and/or participating in clinical rotation and preceptor rotations. The student may be subjected to actions including, but not limited to: A temporary ban from campus Withdrawal from class attendance or experiential learning (i.e., preceptor rotations, community education, college-sponsored travel, etc.) An interim suspension of participation in any campus or off-campus NCNM activities Completion of a mental health, substance abuse, or other necessary evaluation conducted by an appropriate off-campus licensed health provider Students will receive a written description of the details of the ILOA pertaining to them, including the appeal procedures as outlined in section 14 of the student handbook. The letter regarding the ILOA will be placed in the student's file with a copy sent to the program dean(s), associate dean of academic progress, registrar, director of financial aid and the provost. The Registrar's Office will notify course instructors of the student's leave status. A student who wishes to return from an ILOA must provide to the dean of students adequate documentation as outlined in the initial letter from the attending physician or mental health professional demonstrating the student's fitness for returning to NCNM. Students taking less than a full academic year off may find, upon their return, that the appropriate course load required to stay on track will not qualify them for full-time financial aid. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track which must be approved by the associate dean of academic progress/program dean and the registrar. Students who take an ILOA will earn a grade of \"W\" for all enrolled courses at the time the leave is instated. If the student has completed at least 80% of the course at the time of the withdrawal, they may be eligible to petition the faculty member for a grade of \"Incomplete.\" Academic Policies | ncnm.edu 114 Withdrawal from School Students may initiate formal withdrawal by meeting with the dean of students. Students withdrawing from school at any time during the school year must complete an exit interview with Financial Aid and submit a completed \"Status Change\" form available from the dean of students. Failure to register for any quarter is considered a withdrawal, and the student will need to submit a new application and application fee for re-admission. A student facing an alleged violation of the Code of Conduct or Honor Code is not permitted to withdraw from NCNM until all allegations are resolved. A student required to attend an ARAC meeting is not permitted to withdraw or take a leave of absence from NCNM until they have resolved the referral to the committee. Federal Loan Exit Interviews Federal regulations require that any student who has received a federal loan while attending NCNM and who leaves for any reason, including official leaves of absence, must participate in a loan exit interview. Loan exit interviews are conducted by the Financial Aid Office. Independent Study A required course may be completed as an independent study only in exceptional circumstances. Scheduling conflicts may occur for transfer, second professional degree students admitted with advanced standing, or for students who have had their normal program progress interrupted (e.g., by a medical leave of absence). This option does not apply to students following standard program tracks. Independent studies may be arranged for required courses by contacting the program dean and appropriate faculty. The \"Independent Study\" form must be completed and filed with the Registrar's Office. Independent studies are not available for elective courses. See the section on Financial Policies for fee information. Conduct and Professional Standards NCNM expects all students to maintain professional standards of conduct and appearance. These standards are found in the academic and nonacademic policies and procedures section of the student handbook, and in the clinic handbook and honor code. The naturopathic oath, classical Chinese medicine oath, state laws and regulations, and documents of professional organizations such as the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) and the American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (AAAOM) provide further insight concerning professional standards of conduct. The student conduct code in the student handbook specifies procedures for investigating violations of college policies and the sanctions that may be imposed. Academic Freedom NCNM faculty and students are free to question, discover and test all knowledge appropriate to their discipline as judged by the academic community in general. Student Records The Registrar's Office maintains permanent records of each student enrolled at NCNM. Unless otherwise required by law or special circumstances, the college will generally follow the policies set forth in this section. Typically, a student's record contains an application file, personal information necessary for NCNM business, grade reports, and records of any official action by NCNM concerning the student. These records may be examined by the individual 2014-2015 Catalog | Academic Policies 115 student upon written request. Students who wish to review their records may do so by submitting a request in writing 48 hours prior to the time they wish to view their records. Students may not take copies of documents. Students are notified annually via email of their rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) - commonly referred to as the \"Buckley Amendment.\" The Business Office, Financial Aid Office, Office of Student Life and Academic Affairs Office may also maintain student files as required by their respective functions. NCNM will maintain information on students in a secure, confidential manner in accordance with FERPA, and to that end will observe the following guidelines: College officers may review student records on an as needed basis. NCNM holds the following information as directory information, which may be disclosed in response to legitimate requests: name, address, telephone number, college email address, dates of attendance, enrollment status (full time, part time, and leave of absence), academic program, graduation date, photograph and awards received. NCNM will only print the following information in directories: name, year in school, college email and telephone number. Personal information about students will not be shared with third parties on- or off-campus except as directed in writing by the student, the courts or governmental agencies. A student who wishes to review their records may do so by submitting a request in writing 48 hours prior to the time they wish to view their records. A student may not make copies of documents in their files. A student who believes information contained in official records is inaccurate, misleading, or a violation of privacy may request that the records be amended. In the event of a disagreement between a student and the administration as to the disposition of an issue, the student has the right to place a personal position statement in their academic file. A student has the right to file complaints with the appropriate agencies concerning alleged failures by NCNM to comply with applicable laws and rules, and/or their implementing regulations. Students may request information to be withheld by completing a \"Directory Hold Request\" form available from the Registrar's Office. NCNM may, in accordance with FERPA, disclose personally identifiable information from a student's education record without consent if the disclosure is in connection with a health or safety emergency. Each student is responsible for furnishing, completely and accurately, all information required by NCNM so that it may perform its proper function as an educational institution. If a student's circumstances change (e.g., name, address, financial situation, etc.), the student is responsible to ensure that appropriate college officials are informed of the changed circumstance as soon as possible. No part of a student's file, except directory information as noted above, will be released to any person outside of NCNM without written consent of the student, except as required by law. Records for students attending NCNM under the provisions of the Veterans Administration will be accessible to certain authorized state and federal personnel without prior consent in accordance with 45 CFR, part 99.31 and part 99.35. Academic Policies | ncnm.edu 116 FERPA does not apply to employment situations, nor does it apply to candidates for matriculation to NCNM. However, Human Resources and the Office of Admissions adhere strictly to guidelines of professional conduct. All student admission applicant and employee applicant records are the property of NCNM and will not be released or returned except as outlined above. Change of Track Students are admitted to a specific educational track and are preregistered for required courses, as specified in each educational track. Within a track, students are not allowed to drop required courses or take required courses ahead of time. Students are required to follow their educational track. Students may register online for electives only. After matriculation, students may request to change tracks to any of the standard educational tracks by submitting a \"Student Status Change\" form, approved by the associate dean of academic progress, to the Registrar's Office. Once processed by the Registrar's Office, students must follow their new educational track. Students may deviate from the standard educational tracks for the following reasons: documented chronic illness, bereavement, or approved academic accommodations and considerations. Devia - tion requests must be accompanied by the appropriate documentation before approval can be given. A $50 fee is applied to every approved track deviation. A track change also requires a signature from the Office of Financial Aid, since there is likelihood of award modification to the student. All track requests must be completed by week eight of the quarter prior to the quarter in which the change takes effect. Students may require an individual track layout due to approved deviations, a leave of absence, transfer credit, adding a second program, failure of a required course, etc. Due to the timing of some deviations, a student may not be full time and it will be the student's responsibility to add electives, if they wish, to reach full-time status. Adjustments to individual tracks may be required due to course conflicts, and will be made at the discretion of the registrar at no additional cost beyond the change fee. Students who deviate from their approved educational track may be required to take a leave of absence. All track requests must be completed by week eight of the quarter prior to the quarter in which the change takes effect. Students who are admitted into a degree program that does not have a lockstep track are exempt from this policy. Change/Addition of Degree(s) Students who wish to withdraw from one degree program and enroll into another must formally apply through the Office of Admissions. Once admitted, the Registrar's Office and the associate dean of academic progress will inform the student regarding potential transfer credit, challenge exam options, and establish a new track. Students must meet with the Office of Financial Aid, since there is likelihood of award modification to the student. Students who wish to add an additional degree (i.e., become a concurrently enrolled student in two degrees) must formally apply through the Office of Admissions. Once admitted, the student will work with the Registrar's Office to establish a new track. Students must meet with the Office of Financial Aid, since there is likelihood of award modification. Students may pursue no more than two degrees concurrently. See the Financial Policies section for information on fees. Students who matriculate into a second degree will do so under the catalog corresponding to the year in which the student begins the new degree. Adding/Dropping Courses Students will be registered for all core courses in their program. No student may deviate from the established curriculum unless they have submitted and received approval via a \"Petition to Deviate from Current Policy or Requirements\" form. During weeks 1-2 of each quarter, students may change sections in courses for which this is applicable. During this same period, they may also register for elective courses, and must submit an \"Add/Drop\" form with proper signatures to the Registrar's Office. Courses may be officially dropped during weeks 1-6 by submitting the \"Add/Drop\" form with proper signatures to the Registrar's Office. No core course can be officially dropped without the program dean's signature. The grade for courses dropped weeks 3-6 will be recorded as \"W\" (withdrawal) or \"WF\" (withdrawal failing). Students who are withdrawing from the institution will receive a grade of \"W\" regardless of the week they withdraw. Non-attendance in any course will earn a grade of \"F.\" Any courses withdrawn after week 6 are ineligible for a refund. Weekend courses may be added or dropped up to the day before they begin based on the same criteria as above. Weekend courses that are dropped before they begin will receive a one hundred percent (100%) tuition refund. Lab and retreat fees are non-refundable once the term begins, even when the course occurs later in the term. Students who request withdrawal from a course after week 6 must receive program dean and faculty approval. Courses dropped after week 6 are ineligible for a refund. Students who withdraw from a course after week 6 will be assigned a \"W/WF\" based on the grade they were receiving at the time of withdrawal. In addition, students who are on federal financial aid and whose reduced course loads change their status from full time to part time must meet with the director of financial aid.2014-2015 Catalog | Academic Policies 117 Week 1 of term - Students may add/drop/change sections/change to audit and receive a 100 percent (100%) refund. Week 2 of term - Students may add/drop/change sections/change to audit and receive a 100 percent (100%) refund. Students withdrawing from school completely will receive a 90 percent refund.

Weeks 10-12 of term - Course can't be dropped. All courses starting after week one of the term will follow the same add/drop policy as outlined above. Clinic Shifts To add or drop a clinic shift, students must have an \"Add/Drop\" form approved by the associate registrar. Students have a three- to five-day period after the first clinic schedule has been posted to make any additional changes in their clinic shift schedule (add or drop) without being charged. This period is known as the \"schedule adjustment\" period. The actual deadline date is indicated on all schedules posted on campus prior to the beginning of the term. A $50 add/drop fee will be charged for any shift changes after the deadline date, which is approximately one week after the \"schedule adjustment\" period has ended. Students who request any changes in their clinic shifts after the deadline must fill out a \"General Appeal to Deviate from Current Policy or Requirements\" form and submit it to the associate dean of academic progress. The student will be notified of the decision by the associate registrar. Students are responsible for attending their current clinic shifts until decisions are finalized. All fees concerning clinic shifts will apply. Full-Time/Part-Time Student Status Full-time student status requires enrollment of no fewer than 11 credits per quarter. Half-time student status requires enrollment of at least 5.5 credits per quarter. Students who are on financial aid, who reduce their course loads from full-time to part-time status, must meet with the director of financial aid. Student Life | ncnm.edu 118 2014-2015 Catalog | Student Life 119 Student Handbook Students are responsible for reading and understanding all policies and information listed in the student handbook. A current student handbook can be found online at ncnm.edu. Paper copies are available in the Office of Student Life. Student Government Association The NCNM Student Government Association (SGA) is an elected government of the student body. According to the NCNM student body constitution, the mission of SGA is \"to serve as a forum in which the common needs of the diverse NCNM student body are identified, and to use SGA resources to address those needs and to enhance the student experience at NCNM.\" SGA also oversees the management and distribution of the student activity fees collected each quarter with registra - tion. Students elect an executive council\u2014 president, vice president, secretary, treasurer and judicial liaison, as well as class officers and student representatives to college commit - tees. Elections for SGA positions occur every spring quarter, except for the incoming first-year class whose class-wide elections are conducted in the fall quarter. All members of the student body are invited to attend and participate in all SGA meetings. For more information, consult any of the class representatives or any member of SGA. Student Disability Support Services Student Life staff coordinate student accommodations based on Section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students with questions should contact the Office of Student Life. Health Insurance NCNM does not require students to carry medical health insurance coverage. However, NCNM does offer an optional NCNM Clinic Benefit Plan (CBP) for use at the NCNM Clinic. Students are automatically enrolled in the CBP for fall, winter, spring and summer. Students may opt out of the CBP (including the next summer term) by submitting a signed waiver form to the Business Office by the end of the second week of fall term. Students cannot drop the CBP after the two week period. Students wishing to waive the CBP must submit a new waiver form each year beginning fall term. Students may opt back in to the CBP at the beginning of a new term by submitting a re-enrollment form by the end of the second week of classes. As well, students may opt out of the CBP any term as long as it's done within the first two weeks of that term.Housing Although on-campus housing is not available, NCNM is located near residential areas with ample rentals at reason - able rates. Students may contact the Office of Student Life for additional information; consult the postings on NCNMlist, an online forum, for opportunities; and on the Office of Student Life webpage. Student Identification Cards All students receive a photo identification card on completion of new student orientation. Wearing a photo ID is recommended at all college facilities, and required at all NCNM clinics and for entrance to the main campus after hours. This card also allows students to check out books at the NCNM library and at several other Portland college libraries (Oregon Health & Science University, Oregon College of Oriental Medicine, University of Western States, Linfield College Portland campus and Birthingway College of Midwifery) with which NCNM has borrowing agreements. Substance Abuse Policy and Program NCNM is in compliance with U.S. Public Law 100-297 and the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (U.S. Public Law 103-382). NCNM policy prohibits unlawful possession, use or distribution of illicit drugs by students or employees on or off the college premises. A copy of the Substance Abuse Policy and Program is contained in the student and employee handbooks. Drug Testing Policy NCNM is in compliance with Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Administrative Rules 409-030-0100. All students are required to undergo a drug screen prior to any clinical rotations. In addition, any student enrolled in the Global Health and/or Nutrition programs are required to undergo drug screening prior to fieldwork experience. Refusal to take the required substance test may result in an interim suspension from NCNM, and will prohibit the student from participating in clinical rotations or fieldwork at NCNM or any of its affiliates. A copy of the Drug Testing Policy is contained in the student handbook. Campus Crime Statistics The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, codified at 20 USC 1092 (f) as a part of the Higher Education Act of 1965, is a federal law that requires colleges and universities to disclose certain timely and annual information about campus crime and security policies. In accordance with U.S. Public Law Student LifeStudent Life | ncnm.edu 120 101-542, the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990, the college annually publishes and distributes statistics concerning the occurrence on campus of reportable criminal offenses that are reported to campus security authorities. These statistics are available to all students and employees of NCNM. Statistics are also posted online at ope.ed.gov/security. Students and employees are advised of campus security procedures and practices, incident reporting and crime prevention during training; and are encouraged to be responsible for their own security and the security of others. Arrest Policy Violations of local, state and/or federal law are subject to college action. A student who has pleaded guilty to, or otherwise accepted responsibility for, a violation should be aware that the college may also sanction the student. Regardless of a plea, the dean of students must be notified within 72 hours if a student is arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense other than a minor traffic violation. If a student is unable to meet the 72 hour deadline, the student may be placed on an involuntary leave of absence pending a conversation with the dean of students. A student may be suspended immediately, pending a conduct hearing, when an arrest involves an act of violence; the illegal sale, manufacture or delivery of drugs; or when the continued presence of the student on-campus poses a threat to the safety or the rights, welfare, or property of another. If found in violation, a student will be subjected to disciplinary sanctions as outlined in section 14 of the student handbook, up to and including expulsion. If a matriculating student has been charged with a criminal offense between the time he/she submitted an application and the time he/she arrives at school, he/she must inform the Office of Admissions and dean of students prior to arrival. If the college later discovers that a student has withheld disclosure of a criminal charge, he/she may be subject to immediate suspension. If a student is convicted of an offense and allowed to remain enrolled at NCNM, the student will be required to meet with the dean of students and program dean(s) to discuss possible ramifications for clinical rotation and licensure requirements. The intent of this policy is to ensure the safety of patients and other members of the college. Remote Classroom and Children on Campus A remote classroom with audio/video live feeds is available for nursing mothers. Others may petition the Office of Student Life for permission to use the remote classroom. Please note that not all classes are available for remote viewing due to the nature of some classes and specific instructor requirements. Babies in arms are permitted in the remote room, but parents must find off-site childcare once babies become mobile or are over 12 months of age. Due to academic concerns regarding class participation and video education, students are permitted to use the remote classroom for a maximum of two quarters per infant during their program at NCNM. Babysitting is not available on campus, nor is it possible to make private arrangements for on-campus babysitting. Parents are required to make suitable arrangements for off-site childcare so that they can attend class. Children are not permitted to attend class with parents unless authorized by the Office of Student Life. The remote room policy and privileges do not include exams and quizzes. Students are expected to find alternative childcare during exams. Children are not allowed to attend clinic shifts with parents unless they are being seen as a patient and accompanied by a guardian. New Student Orientation New student orientation is a required course that provides students with the opportunity to become oriented and familiar with the campus and their peers; meet with essential faculty, staff and administrators; and learn the rights, responsibilities and expectations of being a student at NCNM. Any student who is enrolling at NCNM part time or greater is required to attend new student orientation prior to the first term of enrollment. At that time, students will be assessed the new student orientation fee, which is charged to their student account. Attending new student orientation is a requirement for graduation from NCNM. A student who matriculates into an additional program during their academic career is exempt from participating in a second new student orientation course. Students who complete new student orientation will receive a grade of \"CMP\" for completion. Failure to attend all of new student orientation will result in a grade of \"NC,\" and the student will be required to retake the course the next time it is offered. Students who miss new student orientation will not be refunded the fee. Students re-admitted to NCNM must make an appoint - ment with the Office of Student Life to determine if re-orientation is required.2014-2015 Catalog | Organization & Governance 121 Organization and Governance NCNM is a nonprofit 501(c) (3) corporation organized under Oregon law.
