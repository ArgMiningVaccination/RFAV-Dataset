IN: It's kind of like a cult game, like in the same genre of the Ouija board, but like different.... And it's called, like, Hitori Kakurenbo - Hide and Seek Alone. And it's like, this elaborate ritual where you invite this ghost to come play hide and seek with you. And to do so you need to do like all this crazy shit. Like you need to get this doll, take all the stuffing out, and then you need to stuff it with rice, and they you need to put, like, a .. you need to put like blood, or a fingernail, or like a hair trimming into the doll. Like connect it with your spirit. And then you, what is it you have to like drown it in a bathtub and tie it with a string? Which are all elements of like, there's some in Japanese folklore culture I believe. I know the rice has something to do with life, which makes sense cause it's like, a carb. And i have read online that people did it and nothing worked. But then others say they did it and like, the TVs were changing. Apparently a korean version called living doll, where like you take a doll - and I forgot to mention that in the original, Hitori Kakurenbo, it's important that you get this stuffed animal that doesn't look human-like. Because if you get one that looks human it has more power or something like that, which i guess kind of makes sense, like I don't know? But living doll, you get a real ass doll, and then you invite it to like come, I don't know, turn your lights off or eat you or something. And apparently people are like scared at shit that happened. Context: I met the informant for lunch and she brought up an old game she heard about from her friend. Background: The informant is a second year student at USC who is Korean-American. She heard about this game from a friend in Saint Louis, where she grew up. She believes her friend read about this game online on a website, likely Reddit. Analysis: This was intriguing to me because it's like a very ritualistic version of Ouija, calling out a spirit but adding in a physical voodoo-esque doll. It's also interesting that people out there are willing to try this out in hopes of meeting or playing with a ghost. "}
