It's that simple and that's how chiropractic relates to COVID-19 and all coronaviruses, flus, and sickness in general. The coronavirus claims daily headlines across the nation and world. The sensational reports tend to focus on tragedies and the ultimate reality that sicknesses can be deadly. Other positive realities and facts exist as well. The coronavirus is a common virus that can cause an infection in the nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses do not accompany the deadly outcomes catching media headlines. People infected with the coronavirus report coughs, fever, and respiratory issues. Some extreme cases involve pneumonia. Antibiotics do not work against this viral attack on the immune system. Recovery primarily involves the strength of the immune system learning the new virus and developing a way to neutralize it. The best weapon for the coronavirus and the flu begins with building a strong, proactive immune system. As you probably already know the flu vaccine is controversial and it's efficacy is debated by many health experts. So what should we expect from a new coronavirus vaccine? Attempts have been made in the past to develop coronavirus vaccines with adverse inflammatory reactions too severe to continue. Our bodies are amazing! One drop of blood contains five million red blood cells, seven thousand white blood cells, and thousands of platelets. These cells work feverishly to heal and defend the body against foreign invaders. The most amazing element of the process comes from the fact that the body adapts and responds naturally and without a conscious decision to do so. The entire process of adaptation and response operates under the direction of the central nervous system. Scientists discovered the unique connection between the central nervous system and the immune system and continue to compile research and evidence about the process. Chiropractic plays a key role because of the spine's (spinal cord, central nerve system) relationship with immunity. Research shows that when the spine remains immobile of misaligned, the body operates in a heightened state of stress equivalent to being in battle. Operating in a heightened state of stress weakens rest, immunity, and growth within the nervous system. Gentle Chiropractic adjustments improve immunity by allowing the nervous system to function at maximum capacity for healing and repair. Chiropractic adjustments increase movement and improve alignment while reducing stress. Evidence shows that people who receive regular adjustments report stronger immunity after beginning Chiropractic care. Research from 2010 determined that patients who received Chiropractic adjustments showed increased levels of a specific signaling molecule in the body called Interleukin-2. Interleukin-2 regulates the activities of white blood cells which are responsible for immunity. The molecule impacts the body's natural response to microbial infection and helps the body recognize and create specific responses that neutralize foreign invaders. This protein molecule was found to be higher in those who received Chiropractic spinal adjustments when compared to those who did not. The primary focus of a Chiropractic adjustment does not center on treating a specific symptom or condition. The increased health and function from an adjustment represents an outcome which originates when interference is removed from the nervous system. While other professions focus on changing the environment to suit a weakened body, Chiropractic pursues strengthening the body to suit the environment. Four Keys to Improving Immunity: 1) Stay on track with adjustments to keep the autonomic nervous system in balance. 2) Consume adequate amounts of Vitamin D, a major immune booster. 3) Add 30-60 minutes of extra sleep to the daily routine. Inadequate sleep depletes immunity. 4) Drink water and remove sugary drinks and snacks from the diet. Sugar drains immunity. 5) Move the body. Exercise increases lymphatic flow and provides significant immune benefits.
