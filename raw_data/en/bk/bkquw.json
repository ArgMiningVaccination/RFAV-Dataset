Specifically, the research team, led by senior author Dorota Skowronska-Krawczyk, PhD, assistant professor in the Viterbi family department of ophthalmology at UC San Diego Shiley Eye Institute, found that an age-related decrease in ELOVL2 gene expression was associated with increased DNA methylation of its promoter. In the case of DNA, methylation of regulatory regions negatively impacts expression of the gene. When researchers reversed hypermethylation in vivo, they boosted ELOVL2 expression and rescued age-related decline in visual function in mice. \"These findings indicate that ELOVL2 actively regulates aging in mouse retina, provides a molecular link between polyunsaturated fatty acids elongation and visual functions, and suggests novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of age-related eye diseases,\" wrote the authors in an article (\" [The lipid elongation enzyme ELOVL2 is a molecular regulator of aging in the retina\"](https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.13100)) published in Aging Cell. The ELOVL2 gene is involved in the production of long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are used in several crucial biological functions, such as energy production, inflammation response, and maintenance of cell membrane integrity. The gene is found in humans as well as mice. In particular, ELOVL2 regulates levels of docosahexaenoic acid or DHA, a polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid abundantly found in the brain and retina. DHA is associated with a number of beneficial effects. Notably, its presence in photoreceptors in eyes promotes healthy retinal function, protects against damage from bright light or oxidative stress, and has been linked to improving a variety of vision conditions, from age-related macular (AMD) degeneration to diabetic eye disease and dry eyes. Skowronska-Krawczyk said the work demonstrated for the first time that a \"methylation clock\" gene had a functional role in the aging of an organ. In this case, the eye. DNA methylation is used throughout the human body, essentially turning biological switches on and off to maximize efficient operation. It has key regulatory roles in the body's cardiovascular, neurological, reproductive, and detoxification systems. In recent years, there has been much work and progress in identifying possible biomarkers that predict the biological age (not chronological) of individuals. Such biomarkers would be useful in identifying risk and status of age-related diseases. ELOVL2 is among the genes attracting greatest interest. \"I have been asked whether I think ELOVL2 is the aging gene,\" noted Skowronska-Krawczyk. \"After thinking about it, it is not unreasonable to think that lower ELOVL2 expression might be at the basis for many age-related conditions.
