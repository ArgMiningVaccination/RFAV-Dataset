A conventional chiropractor's goal is to: The majority of chiropractors take the traditional approach and do a great job at it. However, this type of care falls under symptom relief or symptom management, otherwise known as \"band-aid\" care. At Foundation Chiropractic, we utilize state-of-the-art equipment to determine the presence of a Foundational Shift of the spine, which is typically the underlying cause of a variety of secondary conditions (symptoms) that you may be experiencing. Our doctor is 1 of 300 in the country trained and proficient in Foundational Correction using the Upper Cervical Chiropractic Orthospinology procedure. What does that mean for you as the patient? To further understand the nature of a Foundational Shift, consider that if a house has a poor foundation, you may find it leads to cracks in the walls, windows that do not close correctly, and floorboards that creak. One may choose to continuously address these individual issues (symptoms) by filling in the cracks, lubricating the windows, and hammering another nail in the floor. However, the reality is that these individual issues will likely continue recurring until the underlying cause (foundation) is corrected. \"Had some trouble with my low back from being in a chair all day due to work.
