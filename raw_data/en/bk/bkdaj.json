While you don't need to give up your morning matcha latte, it would be nice not to need one to function. If you're wondering if that's even possible amidst the demands of daily life, we're here to tell you that it absolutely is. You can increase your energy levels with the right tools. While fatigue in response to a workout or a long day is natural, when it becomes chronic, or you find that you can't get energized without coffee every morning, it might be time to take a look at your overall health. Cleansing protocols, such as our 21-Day Program, are designed to help optimize the body's intrinsic ability to detoxify, rebalance, and heal. With the right tools and support, the body can simply function better. By minimizing the toxic burden on the body, balancing out the gut microbiome, and identifying food sensitivities with the 21-Day Program, you can help give your energy levels a major boost. One of the most common reports we get from cleansers after they've completed the program is that they have way more energy. If you're wondering exactly how that works, there are some key factors to consider if you're looking to increase your energy levels. Ease inflammation The 21-Day Program is designed to address inflammation in several ways. Acute inflammation is a healthy immune response to an injury or illness. Inflammation is how the body helps heal and protect damaged or infected tissue. However, troubles arise when inflammation becomes chronic, meaning that it doesn't shut off. When this happens, some disease processes can take hold. Long-term inflammation has been linked to most chronic health problems, such as arthritis, autoimmune illnesses, clinical depression, and cardiovascular disease. The good news is that chronic inflammation can be turned around with a healthy diet and lifestyle changes. And when inflammation is down, energy goes up. Research shows that nagging, ongoing fatigue can result from chronic inflammation. Addressing the root causes of persistent fatigue, such as poor diet, accumulated toxicity, and stress can help profoundly heal your energy. Balance out your gut A damaged, leaky, and inflamed gut can result in a slew of digestive, immune, and skin conditions, including chronic fatigue disorders. A healthy gut with a strong intestinal lining is integral to overall health and feeling energized. Helping the body restore better gut balance is a key feature of the 21-Day Program. By removing potentially allergenic foods, killing off pathogenic bacteria with herbs, promoting digestive rest with shakes and liquid meals, and observing a 12-hour fasting window at night, you can start improving your gut health relatively quickly. Better digestion, radiant skin, and increased immune strength are all typical results after completing the 21-Day Program. Post-cleanse, we encourage you to keep up with healthy habits that help keep your gut happy long-term. Improve sleep quality Sleep needs can vary from person-to-person, but it is important to prioritize rest on the cleanse and beyond. Getting poor, insufficient sleep regularly is a surefire way to feel chronically tired. When cleansing, we encourage you to dial back any strenuous workout routines, minimize stress as much as possible and rest as much as you need to. Your body is doing a lot of deep healing and detoxification work on the 21-Day Program, so you may need more rest than usual. Most people need between seven and nine hours , so find what works best for you. Additionally, a healthy diet free of refined sugars and highly processed foods can help improve rest. And better sleep at night means a lot more energy during the day. Reassess your stressors The 21-Day Program isn't just about adjusting your diet. Your three-week cleanse is an opportunity to take a look at how your lifestyle choices are impacting your overall well-being. By taking the time to prioritize your health as you cleanse, you may develop greater clarity as to what's working well in your life and what's disrupting your flow. Modern daily demands can be intense, and there's no way (or need) to live stress-free. After all, some stress is good stress \u2014 stress can be motivating and mentally and physically strengthening. But chronic stress can take a major toll on your adrenal glands and endocrine system. When your adrenal glands are overtaxed, this can result in deep, ongoing fatigue and burnout. Meditation, yoga, deep breathing techniques, exercise, and adequate social support are amazing ways to reduce the effects of stress. Easing your stress load can help heal fatigue and balance out your energy levels over time. Identify food sensitivities Undetected food sensitivities, allergies, or intolerances can lead to chronic tiredness. Identifying your food intolerances is key when it comes to healing your energy. If you find that no matter what you do you're still feeling tired all the time, it might be linked to something you're eating. The 21-Day Program protocol includes an elimination diet designed to help identify if you're sensitive or intolerant to any foods that you're eating regularly. Once certain foods are eliminated during the cleanse, and then reintroduced during the reintroduction phase post-program, you might be surprised to learn that a dietary staple or two isn't working that well for you. By eliminating or reducing your food intolerances or sensitivities, you can dramatically improve your energy levels in the long-term. There are no quick-fix solutions when it comes to your health. Lifelong wellness, energy, mental clarity, and sustainable energy are the happy side effects of health-promoting lifestyle choices. Consider regular 21-Day Programs during the year as your chance to reset, learn about what foods work best for you, and optimize your body's natural functioning. When you're feeling more energized, you're able to do more, enjoy your life, and show up for your community in the ways that matter most.
