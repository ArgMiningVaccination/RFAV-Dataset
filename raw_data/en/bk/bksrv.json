M EYER AND M ARJORIE A. H OY University of Florida, Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of Florida, Building 970, P.O. Box 110620, et al.2000). Wolbachia is transovarially transmitted by females to their progeny, and infections often areassociated with reproductive anomalies in theirhost (O'Neill et al. 1997). In parasitoids, Wol- bachia can cytoplasmic incompatibility (Stouthamer et al. 1999), thelytoky (parthenogen-esis) (Stouthamer et al. 1990), and alter aspects offecundity (Grenier et al. 2002). In Florida, colonies from Taiwan and Vietnam, respec-tively, and released in a classical biological controlprogram against citrus psyllid, Diapho- 1999; Skelley &Hoy 2004). Worldwide, these parasitoids have asignicant impact on reducing populations of D. citri , which is the most economically important citrus pest in regions where it vectors citrusgreening disease (Chien 1995; Halbert & Manju- nath 2004). Jeyaprakash and Hoy (2000) detected Wolba- chia in the imported population of D. aligarhen- sis . We hypothesized that Wolbachia causes thely- toky in D. aligarhensis , and this was tested by at- tempting to eliminate Wolbachia with antibiotics following the previous work of Stouthamer et al.(1990). This research is important because D. aligarhensis populations are low in Florida, and this could be due to its low reproductive rate(Skelley & Hoy 2004) which may be influenced by Wolbachia . A laboratory colony of D. aligarhensis was maintained as follows. Ten small citrus trees (20-50 cm tall) grown in 15.2-cm diameter pots werepruned each week, fertilized with Peter's 20-20-20(N-P-K) water-soluble fertilizer (United Indus-tries, St. Louis, MO), and placed in wooden-framed mesh cages (0.76 m \u00d7 0.91 m \u00d7 1.11 m) in a greenhouse at 20-32\u00b0C with a 16L:8D photope-riod. Adult female psyllids oviposited on the newgrowth (flush) produced by the trees. Adult D. ali- garhensis were aspirated and released into the cages when immature D. citri reached the rst or second instar. After emergence, adult D. aligar-hensis were fed pure clover honey smeared on small strips of Kimwipes (Kimberly-Clark,Roswell, GA) and used to initiate the next gener-ation. During a 4-year rearing period, all D. ali- garhensis observed in this colony were females (J. Meyer, personal observation). A preliminary toxicity test indicated that 10 mg/mL tetracycline + honey did not negatively in-fluence longevity in adult female D. aligarhensis , so this dosage was adopted for this experiment.For 3 consecutive generations, 50 newly-emerged female D. aligarhensis were administered pure clover honey + 10 mg/mL tetracycline hydro- chloride (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) (Stouthamer et al. 1990) for 24 h at 70-75% RH,24-25\u00b0C with a 16L:8D photoperiod. Treated par-asitoids were released into a separate cage andmaintained as described above. After the thirdgeneration, approximately 60 adult male D. ali- garhensis were observed and collected. Female and male D. aligarhensis were placed on a glass slide and submerged in 95% EtOH orEuparal mounting medium (BioQuip, RanchoDomingez, CA) for photography with the Auto-Montage Pro system with software ver. 5.02 (Syn-optics, Frederick, MD). Morphological differenceswere observed between female and male D. ali- garhensis (Fig. 1). The male abdomen was small and all black, but the female abdomen was largerand was yellowish and black (Fig. 1A, D). Both thegeniculate antennae (Fig. 1B, E) and genitalia(Fig. 1C, F) of female and male D. aligarhensis were structurally distinguishable. The antennae of male D. aligarhensis in an arrhenotokous pop- ulation from Asia (Shafee et al. 1975) were simi-lar to those observed in male D. aligarhensis pro- duced here. Molecular analyses were used to determine if Wolbachia was eliminated from male D. aligarhen- sis . DNA was isolated from each of 3 individual fe- male and male D. aligarhensis with PUREGENE reagents (Gentra Minneapolis, MN) ac-cording A 25-\u00b5Lhigh-delity polymerase chain reaction (PCR) wasconducted according to Hoy et al. (2001) to detectthe gene of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase sequenced ac-cording & Jeyaprakash (2005). The wsp gene was PCR-amplied from all fe- male D. aligarhensis ( n = 3) but not from any males ( n = 3) (Fig. 2). The mitochondrial COI gene was amplied from all samples indicating that the DNA was adequate for the PCR (Fig. 2). Noamplication products were detected in the nega-tive control for both the wsp and COI genes. PCR products from the COI gene of both fe- male and male D. aligarhensis were cloned and sequenced, and the resulting 552-bp sequenceswere 100% identical (GenBank accessionEF431956). This indicated that the males werethe same species as the female D. aligarhensis treated with tetracycline and that another parasi- toid had not unexpectedly invaded the laboratorycolony.The morphological and molecular data support our hypothesis that Wolbachia causes thelytoky in our laboratory colony of D. aligarhensis , the rst report of this phenomenon in this genus.Male production also has been documented fol-lowing elimination of Wolbachia from other thely- tokous parasitoids in the families al. 1996), al. 1990), Scelionidae (Arakaki et al. 2000), Eu-lophidae (Argov et al. 2000), and Aphelinidae (DeBarro & Hart 2001). It is possible that the titer of Wolbachia in male D. aligarhensis was below the sensitivity of the high-delity PCR assay, whichdetects as few as 100 copies of the target template100% of the time and as few as 10 copies 50% ofthe time (Hoy et al. 2001), but, if so, this titer re-duction could still result in male production. Nobacterial symbionts other than Wolbachia were detected in a molecular survey of the importedpopulation of D. aligarhensis (Meyer 2007). Al- though unlikely, it cannot be excluded that uni- Fig. 1.

Male and female D. aligarhensis exhibited mating behavior when they were held together ina 50-mL centrifuge tube (Meyer 2007). First themale faced the female, then moved behind andclimbed on the female, and nally attempted to copulate by bending its abdomen to contact the fe-male abdomen. Males attempted to mate withmultiple females. Further studies are needed todetermine if males produce viable sperm that aretransferred to the female during mating, and if a Wolbachia -free bisexual line of D. aligarhensis can be produced.

S UMMARY Wolbachia is associated with thelytokous repro- duction in D. aligarhensis. Male D. aligarhensis were produced following antibiotic treatment of fe- males in a thelytokous colony. The males lacked Wolbachia , were morphologically distinguishable from females, and exhibited mating behavior. R EFERENCES C ITED A RAKAKI , N., H. N ODA Y AMAGISHI . 2000. PECTOR MIN , AND E.
