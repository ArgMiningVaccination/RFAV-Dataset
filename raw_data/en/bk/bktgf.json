If any other species had created the kind of problem that Human Beings have created, we would have found immediate solutions. If a trillion locusts had come and caused the kind of damage we have, we would have just found a way to exterminate all of them. But right now, it is we who are these locusts. We are causing this damage by functioning unconsciously and compulsively. So, the solution can only be to make Human Beings function consciously. It is only when the multifarious activities of our societies move into a conscious mode that our activities can be oriented toward a solution. We have been the source of the problem, we can also become the source of the solution. In this context, creating a Conscious Planet is the most important goal, as it is only human activity which is causing the damage. The Conscious Planet initiative aims to bring the consciousness of who we are, what we are on this planet and what the planet is to us, in an experiential way. We must work towards creating a planet where a large number of Human Beings act consciously, governments are elected consciously, where ecological issues become election issues in the world. It is imperative that key influencers take ownership of this movement to build awareness among the larger population and move communities and governments towards more responsible environmental action.\"Anukampa 2020 |15 There is only one problem on this planet - the Human Being - the only source of the ecological crisis the planet faces today.Anukampa 2020 |16 Anukampa 2020 |17 It is particularly important for leaders whose decisions affect millions of lives, to embrace conscious and inclusive leadership.Anukampa 2020 |18In January, Sadhguru was back in Davos, Switzerland, after a decade to attend the World Economic Forum 2020 (WEF). Sadhguru spoke at the launch of 1t.org, a major WEF platform that aims to bring together the Trillion Tree community. Trillion Trees is an initiative by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which aims to plant 1 trillion trees worldwide by the end of the decade, taking global tree coverage to 4 trillion. During the event, Sadhguru explained that to maintain fertile soil, rich in organic content, 50- 60% of the soil on the planet needs to be put under shade. He also pointed out that the nutritional value of food we eat has come down by 40% over the last few years and trees have to come back if this has to change. Sadhguru at World Economic Forum 2020 in Davos for the Trillion Tree Initiative Sadhguru conducted morning meditation sessions and a half-day Consciousness Retreat for the most influential leaders in politics, business, academia and global organizations. Sadhguru observed that it is incredible to see heads of nations talking about yoga and inner wellbeing. He also reiterated that it is particularly important for leaders whose decisions affect millions of lives, to embrace conscious and inclusive leadership.Meditation Sessions Leading voices from around the globe, including WEF MD Dominic Waughray; the President of Colombia CEO Marc Benioff; and conservationist Jane Goodall took the stage with Sadhguru to pitch strongly for unified action to address climate change.Anukampa 2020 |19Rally for Rivers Cauvery Calling Rally for Rivers (RfR) is a movement to save India's lifelines - the rivers. Launched in 2017 by Sadhguru to revitalize India's rapidly depleting rivers, the campaign garnered the support of over 162 million people, and helped in the formulation of government policy for river revitalization. The Story So Far This world's largest people-driven ecological movement provided a dramatic impetus to the scaling up of Isha's 23-year grassroot work, now being implemented as Cauvery Calling. Depletion of the Cauvery river by an alarming 40% in the last few decades poses a big threat to the water and food security of the region today. Cauvery Calling aims to combat this crisis by encouraging farmers of the Cauvery basin to adopt tree-based agriculture. As per our experience, this nature-based intervention increases farmers' incomes manifold and gives significant ecological benefits. The RfR movement has also inspired the government of Maharashtra to invite Isha to work with the state agriculture department towards the rejuvenation of the Waghadi river in Yavatmal district. The Waghadi river basin in Maharashtra has been severely hit by soil and water depletion since many years, causing extreme distress among the farmers here. This project will not only revive Waghadi river, but will also positively impact food and water security and farmer welfare in 40 villages in Yavatmal. Recognition in 2020 Isha has been accepted as a member organization of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in February, 2020. IUCN has formally extended support for Isha's work and offered to provide technical assistance for the Cauvery Calling project. Isha was accredited with Observer Status to the United Nations Environment Assembly in July, 2020 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) based on its assessment of Isha's ecological initiatives and their potential for global impact.Anukampa 2020 |20 This is not a protest. This is not an agitation. This is a campaign to raise awareness that our rivers are depleting. Everyone who consumes water must Rally for Rivers.\"Anukampa 2020 |21 \"We, as a generation, are the custodians of Cauvery for a brief time. We have the opportunity to become the generation that restores her Legacy of Abundance. This is the best tribute we can pay to a Life that has nurtured us.Anukampa 2020 |22 Cauvery Calling is a massive on-ground campaign to initiate the revitalization of Cauvery river by supporting farmers to plant 242 crore trees on their own farmlands in the Cauvery basin through tree-based agriculture. Marrying ecology with economy, the Cauvery Calling campaign advocates the practice of tree-based farming in the river basin. Growing high-value trees will significantly boost the income of approx. 5.2 million farmers by 300-800%. It is estimated that planting 242 crore trees will sequester 9 to 12 trillion liters of water in the Cauvery basin. Cauvery Calling This will bring one-third of the 83,000 sq. km. of Cauvery basin under tree cover, while ensuring that Cauvery flows again. Cauvery Calling will not only set the standard for revitalizing India's rivers but rivers across the tropical world - home to 4.7 billion people. Cauvery Calling will also contribute to meeting global ecological goals. As per estimates, the project will sequester 200- 300 million tons of CO2 by 2030, which is equivalent to 8-12% of India's NDCs for 2030 under the Paris Agreement.Anukampa 2020 |23 Mobilizing Farmers for the 2020 Planting Season The planting season, scheduled to begin in early 2020, was planned out meticulously and well in advance. Large farmer training events and visits to model farms to popularize tree-based farming in the region were all parts of a packed calendar for this year. In sync with these plans, the Cauvery Calling team had fanned out to 27 Cauvery basin districts of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to connect with farmers and organize large-scale on-ground outreach programs. The mushrooming specter of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, brought all on-ground activities to a halt. With lockdown clamped on the nation, the team drew up a new digital outreach plan to counter this challenge and stay on target. The goal remained the same but the mode of implementation changed drastically. The physical Project Updates outreach now donned a digital avatar as the core team re-strategized and reached out through WhatsApp and Facebook groups of farming communities, SMS campaigns, local media and press. 84 farmer WhatsApp groups were formed to reach thousands of farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, who helped multiply the reach exponentially through their own local network. The most active farmers' groups on Facebook, with a collective reach of over 400,000 members, were identified and enlisted as well. Sifting through an exhaustive database of 19,000 farmers, Nadi Veeras shortlisted 10 influential farmers in each of the 57 taluks in Karnataka to leverage these contacts optimally and contact as many farmers as possible. A 12-hour farmers' helpline was also set up. Over 120 trained volunteers answered farmers' queries in Kannada and Tamil between 9 am and 9 pm every day and helped them locate nurseries closest to them to collect saplings.Cauvery Calling Anukampa 2020 |24Nursery Operations during the Pandemic At our nurseries, our team collected details of the farmers calling in - names, phone numbers, and the number and varieties of saplings needed. In mid-May, after the Government relaxed the lockdown norms for nurseries and agricultural activities, teams resumed production and nursery maintenance activity while strictly adhering to social distancing, hygiene standards and all safety measures. During the first phase of lockdown, the saplings were cared for and watered daily by the respective Nursery Incharge. Even with reduced manpower, the Nursery Team worked wonders as all our nurseries were ready with saplings at full capacity despite the pandemic. After June 5 when sapling distribution started in accordance with Government guidance, farmers and villagers made a beeline to nurseries to purchase saplings. Those who came in without masks were educated on COVID-19 safety guidelines and provided with free masks. The relentless efforts of the Nursery Team and on- field volunteers along with the tremendous support from Karnataka Government officials, and enthusiasm shown by the farmer community, paid off. Sixty-three lakh saplings were picked up from Forest nurseries in Karnataka while demand for saplings in Isha's nurseries in Tamil Nadu also spiked, keeping us well on track of meeting our overall target of 1.1 crore saplings. 1.1 crore saplings picked up 30,000 farmers enabled 84 farmer WhatsApp groups 12-hour farmers' helpline 120 trained volunteers Cauvery Calling Anukampa 2020 |251.1 crore saplings planted The Cauvery Calling team has enabled 30,000 farmers to plant an incredible 1.1 crore saplings in the 2020 planting season, covering 28 Cauvery basin districts and 189 taluks in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Milestones Rising to the Challenges during COVID-19 Outreach to 5 million farmers An abrupt change of plans from physical to digital outreach was necessitated by the pandemic. But, the team's adaptability, resilience and teamwork overcame all hurdles to reach out to approximately 5 million farmers.Cauvery Calling Incentive by Karnataka Government On top of our team's effort, the State Forest Department of Karnataka also announced an incentive of Rs 125 for farmers for every surviving tree during the first three years and also readied 7 million saplings of 14 high-value species in 90 nurseries under the \"Krushi Aranya Protsaha Yojane\" scheme. This will translate to an incentive of Rs 50,000 per hectare which is a significant support for a farmer to establish the plantations in the first three years. Anukampa 2020 |26 26,000 calls on the farmers' helpline Even during the lockdown period, 120 volunteers were trained to manage the farmers' helpline which dealt with a whopping 26,000 calls in just 2 months, and a backend app was created in a matter of just 3 weeks to address queries. Awareness campaigns at farmer events More than 2 million farmers from across the region flocked to Mysuru from January 21-26 to take part in the Sutturu Mutt Jatre fair, where Nadi Veeras had set up a stall to raise awareness and promote tree-based agriculture. Experts on tree-based farming, top officials of the Forest Department of Karnataka, and 250 farmers converged at the first-ever training program under Cauvery Calling held in Karnataka on February 14. The event succeeded in generating much interest among farmers from villages around Mysuru. Later, the Cauvery Calling team visited farmers willing to take up tree-based farming to assess their needs.Cauvery Calling Anukampa 2020 |27A Tribute to Maram Thangasamy In September, an emotionally-charged, historic moment unfolded at the Senthakudi village in Pudukkottai as farmers and Cauvery Calling volunteers gathered at the launch of a plantation drive. The venue was abuzz with activity as farmers, armed with saplings, eagerly awaited the arrival of the chief guest Thanga Kannan, son of Maram Thangasamy, one of Tamil Nadu's most respected farmers, a renowned environmentalist and staunch advocate of tree-based farming. The indelible contributions of Thangasamy, who hailed from Pudukkottai, in creating awareness among farmers of Tamil Nadu is a huge source of inspiration for agriculturists and environmentalists of the region. An Arignar Anna awardee and avid tree planter, he had dedicated his life to inspire people to plant trees and improve the green cover of the state. This year for the planting season farmers and volunteers joined hands to pay a fitting homage to the visionary environmentalist.Plantation Drives Painting it Green 1.26 lakh saplings 450-15,000 saplings planted in individual farmlands 331 acres of farmland 45 locations 23 districtsCauvery Calling Late Maram Thangasamy, visionary environmentalist of Tamil NaduAnukampa 2020 |28 Commemorating Mahatma Gandhi Early morning on October 2, mammoth teams of Cauvery Calling volunteers trooped out along with thousands of farmers to flag off a week-long tree plantation drive to commemorate the 151st birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the architect of India's freedom movement who championed rural development and self-sufficiency. And, what a green tribute it turned out to be - farmers were ready with saplings that they had picked up in advance from Isha Nurseries. Their enthusiasm knew no bounds as 400 to 10,000 saplings were planted in each individual farm. Nadi Veeras also visited farms, and offered their expertise to farmers on mixed plantations, soil health and water efficiency technologies. 7-day tree planting drive 400-10,000 saplings planted in individual farmlands 1.16 lakh saplings of high-value timber trees planted 285 acres of farmland 50 locations 23 districtsCauvery CallingAnukampa 2020 |29 Cauvery Calling \"My father is well known in Tamil Nadu for his efforts to popularize tree-based agriculture, especially among farmers. I was with him from the early days when he made this green cause his lifelong mission. A lot of people were associated with him along the way. Some stood by him for long and some didn't, but there was one organization which always supported my father in his tree plantation mission - that's Isha. Be it my father's cycle rally to generate awareness and support for tree plantation or any other campaign, Isha and its nurseries were always with him. Recently, to commemorate my father's death anniversary, Isha motivated farmers to plant 1.26 lakh saplings. This is not at all an easy feat to achieve on ground. Immediately after this event held in my father's memory, Isha volunteers took up another massive tree plantation drive to mark the Gandhi Jayanti. It is very heartening to note how Isha always celebrates important days by taking up tree plantation drives. I feel that all these events honor my father's lifetime efforts. This commendable spirit shown by Isha and its effort to get people together for this green cause will definitely go a long way to make my father's dreams come true. Today, whenever anybody approaches me for help on tree-based farming or tree plantation, I ask them to go to Isha Nurseries. I have memorized 40 different telephone numbers of Isha Nurseries across the state which I provide to them. I tell them that Isha volunteers will not only give saplings but will also ensure that the saplings grow well.\"Thanga Kannan Son of Maram ThangasamySharings\"My association with tree-based farming began four to five years back after completing Inner Engineering. In the same session, the volunteers introduced us to tree-based farming. I was inspired and wanted to do something on similar lines, but since I am not from a farming background, I knew I would require a lot of help. When I shared my plans with my family, my parents were a bit apprehensive, but my wife was quite supportive. After some deliberation I bought a 2-acre plot of land and then approached the Isha volunteers for help. They trained me and gave me a live demonstration on tree-based farming and how to use natural pesticides and fertilizers to keep my farm organic. My interest peaked when I found out that the yield from an organic farm fetches a good price in the market. When I began farming on my plot, I also planted timber trees on its periphery. On the advice of the volunteers I bought another 5-acre plot of land. Later, to satisfy my queries, Isha volunteers took me to three natural farms where I was astounded to note how inter-cropping was thriving alongside timber trees. The farmers told me that while the timber trees were their fixed deposits, the other crops on the farm took care of their daily and monthly expenses. I then decided to plant trees in all 7 acres of my farmland. In October when Isha conducted a plantation drive to mark Gandhi Jayanti, I bought 2500 saplings. Now, my farm has 3500 timber trees, and within a few years it will look like a small forest. This is the fixed deposit for my future and that of my family. Mohan Prasad Farmer, Madurai Isha has guided me through my journey. The volunteers tested the soil, told me about the right saplings to plant and about effective water management. Thanks to Isha for planting this vision in my mind and helping to transform this dream into a reality.\"Cauvery CallingAnukampa 2020 |30Anukampa 2020 |31 Cauvery Calling \"Working as a Nadi Veera in Karnataka has proved to be a complete shift from my life in Bengaluru. Even in remote villages, 80% of the people I now come in contact with know Sadhguru and Cauvery Calling. Once we explain the scope of the projects and their nuances, they express readiness to support and offer whatever assistance they can. It's quite overwhelming.Sharath Nadi VeeraOnce we went to meet an influential farmer. One of his friends stood aloof. He wasn't facing me or taking part in the conversation. But, after some time, he started showing interest and then opened up. He narrated in detail the problems of farmers in the region - severe water shortage and inability to meet even their daily needs. He was also moved to know that we had dedicated three years of our life to the project, for the country and the people. At one point, I noticed he was holding back his tears. A unique bond happened between us in that meeting. Within 30-40 minutes, the equation between us had changed. Such interactions, which happen on a regular basis, are one of the many reasons that keep me totally immersed in the activity. Even the threat of COVID-19 didn't deter me. Not once did it occur to me that the virus might affect me. Everyone is so excited to be part of this campaign. Never in my life, have I been part of a movement which so many people from across the spectrum approve of and support.\"\"I am from Mysuru district, Periyapatna Taluka in Karnataka. I am from a farmer family, but I migrated to Bengaluru about 7-8 years ago because farming didn't offer suitable economic opportunities. Another reason I chose to migrate was because my family had taken up tobacco farming, and I didn't like the smell of tobacco. As a child, when I used to go to the farm, I would see only trees on our farms. But by the time I grew up, the trees had been completely destroyed. So somewhere inside me I was aware that we were destroying nature, our environment and, in turn, destroying our lives. So, as I was growing up I kept thinking that I have to grow something other than tobacco and bring back nature in my village. But my economic situation wouldn't allow me much free time to do so. My grandfather had raised a forest in 2-3 acres when I was a child. Every year, I would plant 20-30 saplings in that land whenever I came back to my village on leave.Raghu Chikkanerele Farmer, MysuruIn 2017, Sadhguru launched Rally for Rivers. It really inspired me, and in 2018, I planted 1000 saplings. With the help of Cauvery Calling, this year I bought another 1500 saplings. I intercropped the trees with sweet potatoes to keep the soil fertile and earn some extra income. It has already been five months since I planted sweet potatoes and time has come for harvesting the crop. Along with the crops, now I have a few trees that have grown 12 to 15 feet. Cauvery Calling volunteers have inspired me to take up tree-based farming in a bigger way and commit my time totally to it. What really excites me is that tree-based farming not only helps farmers get economic benefits, but by growing trees, we can also contribute to making the soil rich, saving our environment, and making Cauvery flow again. Tree-based farming also gives me free time, which I will now be using to spread the word about the Cauvery Calling initiative to other farmers.\"Cauvery CallingAnukampa 2020 |32Anukampa Honorable Justice Dalveer Bhandari, International Court of Justice, The Hague, lauded the Cauvery Calling initiative to revitalize the Cauvery river and extended his support to the project on February 28.Connecting to the Call of Cauvery Documentary on Discovery channel Discovery channel aired a documentary film titled Cauvery Calling: A Race to Save a River showcasing our efforts.With Ibrahim Thiaw, UNCCD Ibrahim Thiaw, Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), while delivering a message on River Revitalization on September 3, congratulated Isha on the first anniversary of Cauvery Calling.

I faced one of the biggest challenges of my life when my husband died in an accident in 1986. Before that life was good and easy for me, but now, I had to look after my son and was struggling to find a reason to continue. Both of us were feeling very depressed and we did not know what to do next. At this juncture I came to know about Isha, and during one visit I heard Sadhguru speak at length about agriculture, farming and nature. I was inspired by the idea and I consulted my family members and relatives. Since I hail from a farming background, the decision was unanimous and quick. I bought a plot of 8-10 acres of land in 2005 and my journey as a farmer began with guidance from my relatives and family members. Though I did belong to a farming family, I had little or no exposure to agriculture. So, I took up chemical farming and began pouring chemical fertilizers and pesticides in my farm. Every year I spent a lot of money to purchase 70 sacks of chemicals for Rs 300 each. Not realizing the impact that these chemicals would have on the soil, I kept on pouring. I thought that I am doing some good to nature. Velumani Farmer, Kinathukadavu Town, CoimbatoreSharingIsha Agro Movement Though my earning has increased with natural farming, what satisfies me more is that I can now contribute to other life forms, to nature.But five years down the line I faced the consequences of chemical farming. One day in 2010, suddenly seven coconut trees in my farm uprooted and I could not understand why. I consulted the local agriculture officer and he told me that this was the harmful effect of using excessive chemicals. He asked me to reduce the use of chemicals. I then realized that my intention to take up farming is right but my practices are wrong. That is the time I came to know about Isha's natural farming classes and I enrolled. I learnt a lot in that session and also enrolled in many others subsequently where I picked up all the necessary knowledge about natural and traditional fertilizers and pesticides for natural farming. My foray into natural farming began and for the next five years I did not touch chemicals. After five years when I walked into my farm, I saw tiny holes in it, and earthworms were clearly visible. I was extremely happy to see this because earthworms are one of the best friends for a farmer. This encouraged me to continue natural farming with renewed zest.Today my farm has coconut trees and a wide variety of fruit trees too. I have a few papaya trees on my farm, but I do not touch those and leave the fruits for the birds to eat. We should not grow everything for money. As Nature nurtures us, we should also nurture other life forms. These days, I feel very light and happy whenever I walk into my farm. Unfortunately, people are dying all around due to COVID-19, however, I feel life all around in my farm in the form of birds, worms, cattle, and sheep. My farm is teaching me valuable lessons about life in different forms. My farm motivates me to continue with natural farming which is the right way to get in touch with nature. I have now bought another 3 acres of land. I shall plant only fruit trees there, and in the middle of the plot I plan to put cow feeders to allow our cattle to graze there and have a great time. This too is an offering to nature. Though my earning has increased with natural farming, what satisfies me more is that I can now contribute to other life forms, to nature. I owe everything to Isha, as without their help I would not have known about natural farming at all.\"Isha Agro MovementAnukampa 2020 |39Anukampa 2020 |40 \"Ignorant farm practices are turning fertile lands into deserts.

It has been designed to fan the desire for environmental conservation and instil a sense of pride towards \"green consciousness\" in the future generation. While laying a strong foundation for environmental stewardship, GSM seeks to make youngsters conscious of the indelible connection we have with nature. The efficacy of inspiring students through discussions, audio- visual presentations or seminars has often proved to be quite short-lived. Only practical exposure to nature and environmental conservation can effectively motivate the youth for this cause.

The first target is achieved by including middle school and high school students in sapling development through decentralized school nurseries, tree plantation drives and distribution of saplings. This also means that not just the NGC members, but all students of ages 11 to 17 in these schools are touched by this green movement. Each child is asked to take care of saplings, some of which are planted in the school campus while the remaining are distributed among local residents who are asked to take ownership of the next phase of campaign. Survival of these saplings then becomes the responsibility of the local community with the hope that the bond between people and trees will last a lifetime and enrich the generations to come.Green School MovementAnukampa 2020 |42 \"Every society needs people who will plant trees without thinking whether they get to eat the fruit or not.\"Anukampa 2020 |43The innocent act of planting a sapling at the school campus often results in a bond of a lifetime and the manifestation of what we know as the green thumb. In 2018 some students, participating in Isha Green School Movement, planted 30 saplings at the Andarkuppam High School in Kanchipuram district. Today, those saplings have grown into trees but the tender care of the students has only deepened. The bond with the trees they planted two years back convinced three students - Abhilash, Jaswanth and Saran - to leave the safety of their homes even amidst COVID-19 to head towards their school for a green mission. Twice a week this dedicated team of green warriors took all necessary precautions against the pandemic and went to their school campus to water the trees. Abhilash says: \"I planted Kumizh Thekku (White Teak) when I was in the 8th standard. Now I am in the 10th standard and the sapling has grown into a tree. I feel happy when I sit and study under that tree.\"Green School Movement Of Students and their SaplingsSharing The sapling that I planted two years ago has grown into a tree. I feel happy when I sit and study under that tree.Anukampa 2020 |44 An Appeal You can contribute to the Isha Agro Movement to help our farmers shift to more profitable and sustainable ways of doing agriculture. You can also join the Green School Movement to establish nurseries in schools and enable young students to grow and raise saplings. We seek your continued support to make this happen!

You never know if you will enjoy its shade or fruits, but you know someone will.\" Anukampa 2020 |45 Maharashtra Government has formed a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) named \"Waghadi Nadi Punarujjeevan Foundation\" that will oversee the implementation of this project. The project is being funded by the Maharashtra Government. Isha is offering complete ground support to the government to implement the project by handling ground operations like community mobilization, awareness generation and facilitative interventions. Key Objectives Rejuvenation of Waghadi river Economic prosperity of farmers in Yavatmal Revival of groundwater, soil fertility and biodiversity Resolving man-animal conflict in villages adjacent to forests Increasing permanent tree cover across the river basin The Problem A perennial river a decade ago, Waghadi now dwindles to stagnant pools every summer. With their lifeline drying up, the livelihood of local farmers gets threatened by frequent rainfall deficits and dry spells. Fluctuations in yield and low purchase prices of cotton, soya bean and tur dal only add to their woes. A ripple effect of the severe water scarcity is the degradation in soil quality, forcing farmers to use excessive chemical-based pesticides and fertilizers. This has, in turn, destroyed soil nutrients leading to poor yield. On the other hand, denudation of forest land has forced wild animals to venture inland in search of food and water, leading to animals raiding farms and further crop loss. The Solution Practice of agri-horti-forestry and afforestation will help revitalize the Waghadi river and improve groundwater levels. The green intervention will also increase tree cover and vegetation in the Waghadi basin and significantly enhance water retention capacity. Soil health, too, will improve as the green litter generated by trees coupled with animal waste will replenish organic content and boost biodiversity in the region. Farmers' incomes will be augmented by 5 times through this multi-pronged approach. While soil and water conservation methods, horticulture, natural farming, tree-based farming and cattle rearing will improve farm produce, Farmer Producer Companies will be set up to take care of other commercial aspects like market linkages, community- based micro-irrigation and business development.Waghadi Nadi Punarjeevan PrakalpAnukampa 2020 |46 \" This region is severely hit by soil and water depletion, as well as extreme farmer distress. By transforming Yavatmal's soil and reviving River Waghadi, we are creating a replicable model for all degraded lands.\" Anukampa 2020 |47 The SPV formed by the Maharashtra Government to implement this project was registered by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs - Government of India. For the past 18 months, our Nadi Veeras (volunteers) are working on the following seven Entry Point Activities to win the trust and confidence of the villagers: Soil and Water Conservation 44 high-impact soil and water conservation structures were identified. Six of them are approved under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Sources of irrigation available to 2900 farmers were identified to understand the tree plantation potential and irrigation trend. Tree Plantation Nadi Veeras generated a demand of 1000 acres of fruit, teak and bamboo trees to be planted on farmlands. Plantation on 200 acres has been approved by the Government under MGNREGA and Bamboo schemes benefiting 134 farmers with subsidies. Additionally, under the \"kitchen garden\" initiative, 20 varieties of seeds were sown in 270 backyards with active participation of the women in these homes. 1470 kg of vegetables have already been harvested as of October 2020! On Ground Developments Waghadi Nadi Punarjeevan PrakalpAnukampa 2020 |48 Organic Farming Nadi Veeras facilitated the formation of 10 Organic Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs) in 10 villages to help farmers in production, processing, certification and marketing of organic products. 217 farmers on 500 acres have already benefited with subsidies under the present State Government scheme. Micro-Irrigation We visited and studied three community based micro-irrigation projects in Karnataka and Maharashtra and are in talks with the irrigation department about a feasibility survey to be taken up by the SPV. We are also helping farmers to process drip irrigation. Farmer Producer Company (FPC) & Business Development Our Nadi Veeras studied the economy of the current cash crops and the benefits of switching to fruit, teak and bamboo. Additionally, we facilitated the planting of 47,500 drumstick seeds. We have started forming FIGs for creation of a single FPC under the Prime Minister's 10,000 FPC Scheme.Animal Husbandry We facilitated health camps in 13 villages where 3,400 cattle were vaccinated and also assisted in the demo plantation of fodder stumps. We are helping 66 model farmers to adopt better cattle management processes that will lead to increase in milk production and promote indigenous cow breeds. Community Mobilization We facilitated the formation of 9 village development committees. During the lockdown over 800 phone calls were made to villagers and Government officials to enquire about their wellbeing and offer simple tools to enhance immunity. Post lockdown, we conducted 31 Simha Kriya sessions in 19 villages with over 500 participants. In January 2020 the first ever Marathi Inner Engineering program was conducted - read more about this in the Raising Human Consciousness section.Waghadi Nadi Punarjeevan PrakalpAnukampa 2020 |49 Raosaheb Badhe Project Manager with over 35 years of experience in rural development projects in Maharashtra In Yavatmal, a distressed district of the Vidarbha region in Maharashtra, amongst mounting pressure of debt, farming yields only meager profits. As a result, farmers are understandably skeptical about venturing into new farming practices. But their trust in our team enabled them to take the progressive step of shifting from cash crops to horticulture. After continued efforts by our Nadi Veeras and the Maharashtra Government, 134 farmers felt confident to shift to horticulture under MGNREGA and Bamboo schemes, which granted a 100% subsidy. We supported them through the tedious paperwork needed to avail the subsidy under MGNREGA scheme and also handheld them till they received the saplings. Once while accompanying two farmers, Sadashiv Narayan Dubey and Jaywant Devrao Meshram, to pick up saplings from a nursery which was 100 km away, we spent around 8-9 hours just filling out paperwork, selecting saplings and loading them. Though we were exhausted as it was a hot day, the joy on the farmers' faces made everything worthwhile. On our way back, it was heartening to hear Jaywant calling his farmer friend and excitedly saying, \"The MGNREGA scheme is one of the most difficult and complicated ones. But with the support of Isha, this process is smooth and we can shift to horticulture without a worry.\" Throughout our ride back, this young farmer would not stop calling his friends and senior farmers, inspiring them to make the shift. It is extremely fulfilling to see them filled with hope for a better future.SharingsWaghadi Nadi Punarjeevan PrakalpAnukampa 2020 |50 An Appeal Successful implementation of this project will reverse the fortunes of farmers in the region and could become the first step in revolutionizing agricultural practices across India. The sustained efforts by our volunteers on ground, the government machinery, the farmers and the donors have ensured that despite the pandemic disrupting the \"normal\" ways of life, the project has made significant progress. Your continued support will transform the lives of many distressed farmers and their families.

Shri Arif Shah, an elite trainer of Jaivik Sheti Mission who has represented India on various international platforms, conducted this training. Inspired and supported by Nadi Veeras, 254 farmers attended the training. \"The training was organized at peak harvesting time, so the trainer didn't expect more than 100 farmers to participate. However, we went village to village to inspire various farmers' groups and followed up with frequent calls and messages. On the day of the training, we went to their villages to pick them up. The organizers were surprised to see all the seats were filled and many more farmers standing at the back. The training was for 6 hours. Usually, in such a long training, farmers tend to leave in between. But our farmers were totally involved, and even a 60-plus-year-old farmer was taking notes 4 hours into the training,\" shares Nadi Veera, Vikas Misra. Vikas is a marine engineer and was serving as an officer in the Merchant Navy. \"It is only because of Nadi Veeras that so many of us turned up for the event. We are touched by the way you kept reminding us, and actually turned up in our villages before 8 am to ensure that we don't miss this opportunity,\" said Sanjay Kamatkar, Yelabara village, to Vikas after the training. \"The training busted a lot of myths about natural farming. Here, I got an attractive alternative to chemical farming,\" he added. This group of farmers will go on to form an Organic Farmer Producer Organization (FPO).Nadi Veera Vikas Misra |51 Rural EducationQuality education is the only ladder that we can provide these rural children to help them and their families climb out of the economic and social pit.\" Anukampa 2020 |53Isha Vidhya The Story So Far Transforming rural education since 2006, Isha Vidhya has busted the myth that you must lower standards to educate rural children. The pioneering initiative has brought much cheer among rural community members who desire quality education for their children but lack the means to fulfill these dreams. Isha Vidhya's donor-funded scholarships, dedicated teachers, passionate volunteers, and Sadhguru's inspiration have together translated into measurable results for students. For six years in a row now, Isha Vidhya students have achieved a 100% pass rate in the final exams for Class 10. Revolutionizing the education sector The scale and scope of Isha Vidhya transcend mere numbers. Giving wings to the dreams of millions of children, Isha Vidhya is revolutionizing the rural education sector by making quality education accessible and affordable for all, especially rural children. Isha Vidhya has been carefully nurturing the ambitions of the next generation, and helping them achieve new heights in academics, sports, cultural activities and environmental conservation. In addition to setting up education infrastructure, Isha Vidhya has introduced innovations in teaching techniques that go much beyond securing a perfect score by ensuring the overall development of each student. Isha Vidhya has also helped build the capacity of teachers at Government schools under the Government School Support Program (GSSP) by conducting training programs to make academics more student-centric. Accreditation Isha Vidhya's transparency with its accounting and prompt reporting has resulted in several reputed donation platforms granting accreditation: Give India, Global Giving, United Way of Mumbai, CAF (India), CAF (America), National CSR Hub (Tata Institute of Social Sciences), Guidestar India. We are a registered Public Charitable Trust with 12A, 80G, FCRA, and all other statutory approvals.Anukampa 2020 |54 Anukampa 2020 |55The year began on a golden note for Isha Vidhya with several students winning accolades in national and district level sports events. However, the usual buzz on our campuses fell silent in March as summer vacations were ushered in early by the COVID-19 lockdown. The schools may have closed down but our hearts remained with our students. During the pandemic our first priority was to check on each and every student of Isha Vidhya. The Isha Vidhya team reached out to the students and their families to enquire about their wellbeing. The gesture was deeply appreciated by the families of these students. They felt reassured and expressed gratitude that Isha went beyond the call of duty to reach out to them during this time of crisis. This long period of being away from school, however, came with its own challenges. And, to ensure that the children do not get distracted and out of touch with academics, we delivered study books to students' homes, wherever the parents found it difficult to come to the school to pick them up. Also, the switch to online learning was supported by our teachers and academic team who came up with innovations of their own to launch several online home learning programs. To ensure that the students do not miss the campus bustle and playtime with their friends, fun-filled activities were also started. Students solved puzzles and designed projects in their virtual classrooms. Realizing that only 60% of our students have access to smartphones, Isha volunteers took it upon themselves to help at least a few students who didn't have access to one as they were essential for attending sessions.Isha Vidhya 2020 Challenges and InnovationsAnukampa 2020 |56 Get Mentored Additionally, \"Get Mentored\" interactive sessions were organized for students as well as teachers which featured scientists, economists, entrepreneurs, and experts from other fields.

Our Government School Support Program (GSSP) strengthens systemic delivery processes, optimizes infrastructure, broadens outreach, and deepens the impact of education. This scalable model is a cost-efficient alternative to building new schools. Government schools face numerous challenges like a high student-teacher ratio, unmotivated teachers, lack of basic facilities, gaps in teacher recruitment, and a high student drop-out rate. GSSP aims to address these challenges with interventions that support both students, and teachers, strengthen the academic delivery mechanism and promote all-round holistic development.Anukampa 2020 |65 Encouraging Sports Activities As part of the GSSP initiative, sports materials were also provided to 22 government schools in 3 districts - Tirupur, Coimbatore, and Salem. This is to encourage government school students to take up sports activities and enhance their skills. Medals, trophies, shields, and certificates were also provided to applaud talents during sports day events.GSSP Highlights 01 Extensive Teacher Training using Isha Vidhya methods, including continuous monitoring and feedback 02 Special assistance to slow learners, who constitute 30% of the class, through critical remedial interventions 03 Improving children's English language skills through special methodologies 04 Supporting holistic development through sports, Yoga, environmental education & health awarenessAnukampa 2020 |66 An Appeal The Isha Vidhya team, with the support of numerous volunteers, is doing its best for the children. Despite schools not being open to the children during the pandemic, most of the expenses continue to be incurred, towards salaries, books, notebooks and learning aids, electricity, internet, telephone, etc. Parents of fee-paying students have been struggling to meet the costs. Keeping the parents' situation and interests of the children in mind, we have been quite understanding with the parents, despite our financial constraints. We seek continued support from all our donors to ensure that the necessary funding is mobilized to keep our schools running. With corporate donations at a minimum this year, we are depending heavily on individuals to make up for the shortfall. We also seek volunteers who can help support our academic team and fundraising team in their efforts.

Our efforts focused on stopping the spread of the deadly virus and preventing starvation from becoming the basis of suffering or death among the most vulnerable. Soon after the nationwide lockdown was announced, Sadhguru appealed to young volunteers to join the fight to beat the virus. Though the pandemic caused loss of livelihoods and paralyzed rural economies, young professionals from different walks of life answered Sadhguru's call and joined the efforts to keep the community safe.Anukampa 2020 |70Beat the Virus Prevention is better than cure During the initial phases, our focus was to stop the spread of the virus by raising awareness and helping boost people's immunity. Travelling for long distances daily to reach far-flung villages, our volunteers knocked on every door, educating families on preventive actions they could take and distributing Nilavembu Kashayam. Drinking Nilavembu Kashayam has now become a cherished morning ritual for villagers and front line workers alike as they queue up for their Beat the Virus daily dose of this immunity-boosting herbal drink with multiple health benefits. To increase public awareness on the pandemic and equip people to protect themselves, Isha in association with the state health department and the local police, distributed informative video clips and leaflets. Public announcements and posters were also used effectively to tell the villagers about the importance of adopting preventive measures. Volunteers went door to door distributing informative leaflets to raise public awarenessAnukampa 2020 |71 Save the Saviors Police personnel and essential service providers, who stayed away from their homes and families for months to selflessly do their jobs, also faced difficulty in getting food as the hotels and eateries were closed. Isha volunteers ensured that those who put their lives on the line for the masses were cared for and did not go hungry. To ensure the safety of the first responders, Isha distributed protective gear like face masks and hand sanitizers to health workers, police personnel, panchayat officers, sanitation workers, and primary health centers to enable them to serve the community without fear. Isha volunteers also travelled long distances every day to give Nilavembu Kashayam to these front line workers even in the most remote locations. Joining Hands to Beat the Virus Our ambulance services were kept on standby to transport patients to treatment centers in the event of an outbreak. Medical supplies and equipment were provided to support Pooluvapatti Primary Health Center in Coimbatore district for the setting up of a 30-bed isolation ward. Extending support to the Tamil Nadu government in its efforts to contain COVID-19, Sadhguru offered to open up the Isha Yoga Center premises in Coimbatore for people needing medical attention. Sadhguru also said that, if needed, Isha volunteers could also provide support in government hospitals. Sadhguru stressed that hunger and starvation have the potential to cause civil unrest and lack of employment would lead to starvation amongst daily wage earners and their families. He said that it is the responsibility of every citizen to stand up and do what best they can to assist the local administration in fulfilling their responsibilities. Volunteers distributed hand sanitizers to essential service providers Anukampa 2020 |72As lockdowns continued, economically weaker sections of society started to suffer from a lack of basic nutrition. Anticipating the looming hunger crisis, Isha volunteers set up community kitchens with the highest hygiene standards. They delivered cooked meals and immunity boosters to the community so that loss of livelihood didn't translate into the loss of life. Every day Isha kitchens started operations at the crack of dawn to prepare hot, nutritious meals in several batches. Even while distributing the food, they maintained proper distance and followed all safety measures. The volunteers travelled over dusty tracks for long distances to ensure that the food reached villagers, migrant workers, and tribals living in remote villages. Because Hunger Cannot WaitBeat the VirusAnukampa 2020 |73 Support for Farmers Not only did the farmers contribute to our kitchens, but many of them also gave shelter to the migrant laborers who had been stranded due to the lockdown. While we provided nutritional support to these laborers, we reached out with marketing support to the farmers. The food providers of this nation, the farmers, had to keep working at their farms even when the pandemic kept most of us indoors. And when the lockdown was relaxed, it was time to sow seeds for the next crops. They have never stopped working. The absence of farm laborers made their task extremely difficult. Isha volunteers reached out to provide timely marketing assistance to farmers and did all they could to ensure that their daily toil didn't go in vain. Their objective was to reach perishable produce to markets as swiftly as possible to ensure a fair price for fresh produce.Starvation helpline: 90-100 calls per day 17,000 + people reached in 6 weeks Standard hunger kits that would last a family of 4-5 for 7-8 daysAnukampa 2020 |74 When the wellbeing of others is above your own, a different kind of strength, a strength that will carry you through life and beyond, will become available.\"Moved by the loss of livelihood and troubles faced by the vulnerable communities during the pandemic, Sadhguru poured out his compassion on canvas. He painted two masterpieces to contribute to the fundraising initiatives of Isha. Sadhguru had promised to give the paintings to the persons who donated the maximum amount to Isha's Beat the Virus fund. These two paintings were auctioned on an online platform. Colors of Compassion To Live Totally! The first painting, an abstract oil on canvas titled \"To Live Totally!\" features different aspects of our life and depicts various life forms including an ant, dolphin, butterfly and elephant. Written on the painting is Sadhguru's message: \"a day is but a piece of time that lets us live and die... this day let us live and live totally.\" Bhairava The second painting \"Bhairava\" was Sadhguru's tribute to Isha's iconic bull who passed away earlier this year.

The roads wore a deserted look and the common areas were without the usual bustle. As Isha volunteers reached the villages, the residents queued up, dutifully maintaining social distance for their daily dose of Nilavembu Kashayam, the immunity-boosting herbal drink, which they now fondly refer to as \"Corona Tea.\" A volunteer said, \"Initially, many villagers complained about its bitter taste. But, now that they know how Kashayam helps fight Coronavirus and other ailments, they eagerly wait for their turn.\" Overcoming Addictions Every morning, the sanitation workers of Booluvampatti village were among the first to line up for the herbal drink. \"We owe a lot to Kashayam. It helped us quit our addiction to liquor,\" said one of the sanitation workers. His co-workers too asserted that Kashayam has helped them turn their lives around and lead a healthy life. \"Over the years, drinking liquor before starting our day's work had become a compulsory, daily ritual. But, since Isha volunteers started offering Kashayam early every morning, we found that we don't feel the craving for liquor anymore. Kashayam has helped us forget liquor and we all feel much better and more energetic these days,\" one of the sanitation workers said. Going the Distance In another part of Coimbatore, Venkatesh was headed towards a nearby village on his bicycle when he spotted Isha volunteers distributing the herbal drink among villagers. Venkatesh said: \"When I learnt that the herbal drink was meant to help us fight the pandemic, I began travelling 10 km every day on my bicycle to drink the Kashayam. Soon afterwards I joined the volunteers and started distributing Kashayam to people living in interior parts of the district.\"Opening Homes and Hearts to Migrant Laborers A housing construction site in Pachinampathi village resounded with the laughter of children as they played inside an under-construction building. Their parents sat in groups at a little distance, chatting amongst themselves with their mouths covered. Fifty migrant workers hailing from West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand had got stuck at the construction site during the lockdown. A migrant laborer from Odisha said, \"Work at our housing construction site stopped suddenly and we had no means to earn livelihood. But, thankfully our worries ended quite miraculously. Local residents gave us a place to stay and Isha volunteers ensured that none of us went without food. They also gave Nilavembu Kashayam to us and our children daily.\" Abu Bakkar, a villager, told the volunteers that he has been observing fast for Ramadan. While appreciating their efforts, Bakkar stated that he breaks his fast by eating the food that he gets daily from Isha volunteers.Beat the VirusAnukampa 2020 |78Anukampa 2020 |79 Medicine Man Shamboornam, aged 55, a resident of Narasipuram village was in a terrible fix. She had been advised by her doctor to take medications daily to treat her ailments but she had run out of medicines. She needed medications urgently but there was no means to get them. All her family members were worried as her condition could worsen any day. With no pharmacy open, she turned to an Isha volunteer, Jayakumar, for help. That became the genesis of a bond of care and compassion between them. She and her family members were very relieved to see Jayakumar return the very next day with Kashayam and her medicines. Since then the volunteers made it a point to check up on her daily to see if she needed any help and she too would wait eagerly for that familiar daily knock on her door. Family Ties Pradap, an Isha volunteer, was on his daily rounds, distributing food and Kashayam to villagers of Puttur when he felt somebody tugging at his shirt's sleeve. He turned around to find a woman, bowed with age, speaking to him with a deep sense of familiarity. \"I was quite surprised at the ease with which she spoke to me. She treated me like a family member,\" said Pradap. She told him, \"I am unable to walk properly, son, and feel like I will fall every time I get up. You know how it is now, I can't even go out to get some help. Get me a walking stick tomorrow when you come for your next visit.\" Pradap's surprise turned into a deep sense of empathy. He later told other volunteers: \"The aged woman had treated me like a family member because she now considers Isha volunteers as her own. She had no one else to turn to.\" The old woman's face lit up with a smile when Pradap got her a walking stick the next day.Beat the VirusSugarcane Story When Isha volunteer Premkumar entered Moolakkadupathi, he saw a little boy was enjoying a sugarcane by the roadside. When Premkumar approached him, the boy dashed off with a mischievous smile on his face. He returned with his mother a few minutes later. They offered a sugarcane to him as a token of gratitude for helping them. His mother said, \"I am very thankful to you and other volunteers for helping us. You all are doing so much good for our village.\" Sharing is Caring In Samanapudur village, when our volunteers were delivering food packets to local residents, they got a pleasant surprise at the home of an elderly woman. She told the volunteers that they should give her food packet to another villager who was in dire need. One of the volunteers explained: \"Her young grandson had already taken food for her, so she did not want excess. Instead, she wanted us to help her neighbors.\" Young Role Models It was a day of joy for two 8-year-old boys as their wish had finally been granted by their parents. They had made several appeals to their parents to allow them to join the Isha volunteers to help the community. The boys were also ready to put aside their rivalry for the larger cause. The brave, young duo first volunteered to help harvest tomatoes from a farm and then joined the volunteers in distributing Kashayam. A volunteer said, \"They also helped us tell the community about the importance of maintaining discipline and caring for each other. These children are showing us the way.\" Rubberband Tales An elderly woman called out to Isha's volunteers when they were distributing Kashayam in Jakkirnaickenpalayam. \"The aged woman had painstakingly collected a large number of rubber bands for us to help us in her own way. Her gesture was quite moving for us.\" She told a volunteer: \"I have collected these for you. Please use these to bind the packets of cooked food that you give to us daily.\" Beat the VirusAnukampa 2020 |80Anukampa 2020 |81 Action for Rural Rejuvenation A movement aimed towards raising the human spirit and inspiring human beings to stand up for themselves.\"Action for Rural Rejuvenation (ARR) is a unique and holistic rural health care model which offers primary healthcare services by adopting both allopathic and alternative systems of medicines through its dedicated team of qualified and trained personnel.

I consulted numerous allopathic doctors for a remedy. Though they diagnosed my skin ailment as psoriasis, nobody was able to provide any respite. I am 23 years of age and already had this chronic ailment, which was proving to be incurable, had worried and depressed me to no end. The disease not only gave me physical discomfort, but also proved to be quite awkward and distressing as I was always busy trying to satisfy the itch. Finally, after three long years of constant suffering, the MHC van came to my rescue. I learned about it from an aged woman who stays nearby and visits the MHC regularly. It's been close to two months since I began consulting the MHC doctor who has given me Siddha medicines free of cost. My black patches are reducing and the itching has completely stopped since then. My hands are now free to focus on daily chores and looking after my young daughter. I am amazed by the quick results. Impressed by my positive and quick results, my husband, who has similar skin lesions, has consulted the MHC doctor. His treatment also has begun.

I then underwent a cataract surgery in my right eye, which was done free of cost. Isha volunteers took me to the hospital and dropped me home after the surgery. During the camp and again during post-surgery checkup they gave me free meals too. An Isha volunteer visited all eye surgery patients in my village regularly and checked whether we were taking our eye drops and medicines regularly. The surgery gave me my sight back and I am extremely happy. Now, I can manage all my household activities and move about independently without any assistance. Now, I want to get my sight back in the left eye so that I can earn a living as a farmworker or domestic help. I have spoken about this to many people in my village and 4-6 of them are already willing to attend the next eye camp and undergo cataract surgery. I cannot thank Isha enough for stepping in when we needed them the most.\" Rukmini Arokya Alai beneficiary, Devarayapuram \"After getting separated from my husband, I have been living alone, totally dependent on the government's monthly pension of Rs. 1,000. I am 50-year-old and have one daughter. Though she is married and has her own family to look after, she is now taking care of me. For the last 10 years, I was suffering from impaired vision. Initially, I had difficulty seeing during the evening, but gradually the problem aggravated further and I had trouble during the day too. In the last 4 years, it worsened and I gradually lost my eyesight. I did not consult any doctor because I did not know that it could be corrected by eye surgery. Doctors told me that I had diabetes and hypertension, but I did not take any medicines. Due to this condition, I was confined to my bed most times of the day and was dependent on people around me for my day-to-day activities. One rainy day, while going to the bathroom, I fell because of my poor eyesight and my left wrist got fractured. At such a juncture some volunteers came to my house and informed me about a free eye camp being conducted by Isha in collaboration with Aravind Eye Hospital.Action for Rural RejuvenationAnukampa 2020 |85Anukampa 2020 |86 \"Isha has been providing a great deal of help to our panchayat and surrounding villages for more than 15 years now through on-ground activities as a part of the AYUSH-Isha Organic Health Systems. Our panchayat Village Administrative Officer Mrs. Uma acted as AYUSH Sevak (volunteer) for the last three years, helping hundreds of people to fulfill their basic requirements for medicines. The AYUSH-Isha Scheme has brought back our faith in the traditional way of treatment as we now know that it can provide a solution for chronic diseases like ulcers and joint pain. I am happy to share that many people have been cured of their chronic ailments by taking these AYUSH medicines - 55 residents of our panchayat have recovered completely from anemia. Though the recovery process hasn't been easy, Isha volunteers created awareness about anemia by going from doorstep to doorstep. They also provided us with medical checkups, free medicines, checked if we are taking our medicines regularly, and gave dietary advice for improving the intake of iron. As a result of their continued efforts, the lifestyle of people has changed drastically and we are now looking towards a healthier future. Under this scheme, the volunteers educated people on how to use organic herbs for our wellbeing. Through our panchayat, we have set up a herbal garden in Viraliyur village. Isha also teaches Upa-Yoga to the students, which has numerous benefits like enhancing their memory, which in turn, helps the students in their education.

The holistic approach is aimed at motivating villagers to rehabilitate their communities and steer their destinies. Anukampa 2020 |89Raising awareness on the need for efficient waste management and its positive impact on health and overall wellbeing is one of the primary objectives of this project. As part of waste management, we provide every household with two dustbins: one for organic waste and the other for inorganic waste. After processing them with care, the organic waste is converted to high-quality compost that the Velliangiri Uzhavan Farmer Producer Organization farmers are free to use in their farms. We ensure that no waste ever goes waste! Waste Management Rural & Tribal Welfare 173.5 Tons waste collected 962 Households and other locations Scholarship Distribution Isha has been supporting the local and tribal village students for their school/college education. The efforts bore fruit recently when 10 tribal students of Thondamuthur overcame centuries of socioeconomic disadvantages to become the first members of their communities to complete graduation and gain mainstream employment opportunities. These scholarship students proved that with a little support, hurdles or humble backgrounds cannot pose a hindrance to success. For over a decade now, Isha has been supporting the educational aspirations of students who neither had access to educational opportunities nor the skill set to make them employment-ready. Their determination to help themselves received a boost with Isha's scholarships which cover not only tuition fees but also transportation, uniforms, and stationery.

Moved by their poor financial status and the urgent need for hygiene, Isha has taken up building toilets for the tribal people and others who stay in nearby villages. This will help improve their health and hygiene standards.Toilet Construction580 Toilets Constructed 21 Villages Covered 1707 People Benefited 5 Town panchayats Isha's Rural and Tribal Welfare team is working closely with several village communities to improve their financial health and economic wellbeing. Some of the villagers, after being trained by the volunteers, have also been given job opportunities in the Isha Yoga Center activities. The team of volunteers identifies the talent, aptitude, and interests of young men and women so that they may be trained to become gainfully employed. As a result, several enterprising individuals who expressed interest were provided with shop space near the Adiyogi statue in the Isha Yoga Center campus. Self-Help Groups have also been formed which are being given regular training and support in managing the shops and accounts. During the pandemic, however, this project got stalled. All the shops in the Isha Yoga Center campus along with entry to the imposing Adiyogi statue were closed as per Government regulations.Livelihood ActivitiesRural & Tribal WelfareAnukampa 2020 |91 \"I have worked as a mid-day meals helper in the nearby Government school for the past 7-8 years while my husband has a tender coconut shop (along the way to the Adiyogi statue) at the Isha Yoga Center campus in Coimbatore. My son studies in the 10th standard in Muttathuvayal School and my daughter is a 12th standard student in PSG School. Before Isha constructed toilets for us, we used to go to the forest to answer nature's call during the day. At night we went near the Government school. There was only one toilet of the Government school for all the villages situated nearby. And the toilet inside the school was only for students and they too could use it only during school timings. We had no choice other than opting for open defecation and using river water for washing purposes. We had to also beware of animals that also frequented the river for drinking and bathing. For women, especially during the menstruation period, going out into the forest became even more difficult and posed great health risks. Five years back Isha volunteers came to our village and our lives changed for good. Isha volunteers built toilets within our homes. They have constructed toilets for most houses in the village. Now, going to the toilet is no more a health hazard and dangerous. We regularly clean the toilets and maintain hygiene standards. I wish to express my deepest gratitude to Isha and its volunteers.\"Ramathal Toilet Construction BeneficiarySharings Now, going to the toilet is no more a health hazard and dangerous. Rural & Tribal Welfare\"For more than 10 years I have been staying with my family in Semmedu. If you had visited my village even a couple of years back, you would have found several small and large, stinking garbage heaps dotting the landscape, making it impossible to pass by without covering your nose and feeling disgusted. Thanks to Isha, we have turned our lives around and cleaned up the mess. Usually, I clean my house twice daily, collect the waste in a dustbin and throw it on the huge heap of waste material beside the main street which is about 100 meters away from my house. At times, feeling too lazy to go outdoors to throw, I would keep the dustbin full of waste inside my house itself for 2-3 days. We usually threw the waste wherever space was available - especially at street corners, under the water tank, near a lamppost, etc. So if you had come here previously, you would first notice many heaps of waste spilled over and scattered on roads and ditches. It was awkward and distressing to walk through the streets littered with garbage heaps that would lie unattended for days. The garbage heaps were proving to be our bane as they would cause water stagnation and contamination and become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other diseases like chikungunya, and cause dysentery, etc. The worst affected were our children. In 2015, Isha volunteers came to our doorsteps, gave us two free dustbins (rose and green color for recyclable/compostable waste), and educated us on types of wastes and ways of disposal. And, the haphazard disposal of waste stopped for good. An Isha Sevadhar, Shakunthala, comes daily in a 3-wheeler, ringing the bell, to collect waste from us every morning at 6:30 am. Now, it is quite pleasing to see our village; it appears so clean, safe and hygienic. The transformation didn't happen overnight but the change is beyond anything I could ever have imagined.

This festival is celebrated every year with great fanfare and fervor at the Yoga Center and turns out to be quite a unique experience for Isha volunteers, tribal and rural villagers, farmers and people from other states as well as overseas folks. They regaled in preparing pongal in earthen pots that were provided to them along with all the required ingredients. No celebration is complete without music and dance, and students of Isha Samskriti and Isha Vidhya took center stage to present vivacious dance and skit performances. Isha also conducted games during the festivals, gave away prizes to the winners, and organized cultural performances to encourage local artists. One of the major attractions of Pongal 2020 was a cattle exhibition which showcased over 20 indigenous breeds from different states of India, including Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. People of various age groups thronged the venue to catch a glimpse of the different breeds of cattle all of which had been reared at the Isha Yoga Center.

At every step we encountered a new problem that would increase the cost of production and transport, and lower our profit margins. For instance, I found it extremely difficult to arrange for a vehicle to transport my goods to the market and hire laborers to load the goods on the vehicle. I had to pay exorbitant rates for renting the transport vehicle and for hiring laborers. These mounting expenses caused heavy losses. Sharings Even after reaching the market, the problems did not end as we could sell vegetables and other farm produce only through the middlemen. Since we were acting individually we didn't have the power to determine the price for our vegetables and never got reasonable and stable prices for our produce. The middlemen harmed our profits because they fixed the price for our produce which would always be lower than our expectations. Then, we had to pay 10% commission to the middlemen for helping us sell our products. Four years ago I finally broke this vicious cycle when I became a Velliangiri Uzhavan member. That became the turning point in my life and also for many other farmers like me. Now, Velliangiri Uzhavan takes care of everything for us after the crops are ready - right from harvesting to marketing and depositing the money in our accounts. Velliangiri Uzhavan has its own goods vehicle and its representatives pick up the produce directly from our farms. And they charge a very reasonable rate for renting the vehicle. Along with a number of free services, Velliangiri Uzhavan also helps us market our vegetables without charging any commission. Velliangiri Uzhavan also helps us get the best market price for our produce.

But, since I joined Velliangiri Uzhavan my luck has changed, I am now able to earn better. Velliangiri Uzhavan had organized a workshop which helped improve my cattle's overall health and milk production within a matter of days. My association with the Sampanki farmers group of Semmedu village (Cluster No. 1) of Velliangiri Uzhavan has proven to be a boon. Apart from a small farm, I own four cows, four goats and some hens. However, my cattle fell ill frequently and could not generate more than 33 liters of milk daily. The milk was poor in density and the buyer paid me less owing to the quality (Rs. 24 to Rs. 25 per liter). This used to be a source of constant stress for me, because I spent a lot of money and time to buy fodder and for the upkeep of my cattle, but the returns were not good enough. I got an opportunity to attend a training session on Azolla cultivation, organized by the Velliangiri Uzhavan. The training proved to be very useful as I learnt about the benefits of Azolla. Following that, Velliangiri Uzhavan gave me an Azolla pond liner sheet (9 ft. x 6 ft.) and some seeds free of cost. With proper guidance from the FPO, I started Azolla cultivation on my farm. I realized that an Azolla farm is very easy to maintain and does not require hard work or extra time. After just 15 days, I started harvesting more than 1 kg of Azolla daily from my farm. I started feeding it to my livestock regularly and that made a world of difference. The effect of Azolla in their daily feed was like a miracle. My cattle seemed more healthy and well-protected from disease. The quality of milk has improved remarkably and the buyer now pays more (Rs. 26 to Rs. 27 per liter). Thanks to Velliangiri Uzhavan, I could start Azolla farming without any investment. And now I am getting an additional income every month. Inspired by my good experience with the Azolla experiment, my family members also have started adding Azolla in the daily fodder for their cattle.\" Bagiyam Farmer and Velliangiri Uzhavan Member, Narasipuram Village An Appeal We look forward to partnering with committed organizations to empower the farmers of the nation and build an India that will be a model of inclusiveness, where agriculture is a sustainable source of livelihood.

The objective is to revive more than 136 unique weaves indigenous to rural India by adopting looms and weaving clusters, facilitating the use of natural dyes, and developing market access. This movement is just as much about reinstating the use of natural and handmade fabrics over synthetic and machine-made ones as it is about realizing the impact our clothing has on our mental and physical wellbeing. It is a conscious shift in how we dress today. \" When human hands and heart work in tandem, that is grace in the making. Handwoven cloth has beauty and grace that is significant.\"Sabyasachi Mukherjee in Conversation with Sadhguru Fashion And Beauty Through A New Lens EventsSpeaking to renowned Indian fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee in June, Sadhguru talked about the following issues/topics: Comfort should be important in fashion and the solution lies in changing fashion choices and opting for organic clothing. Clothing is intimate to human beings and must be hand produced as much as possible, if not completely. Isha is trying to connect New York and American fashion designers with Indian weavers and cloth makers to enable an exchange of handmade textile products. This model must be taken up commercially by Indian designers so that it can be scaled up to a global level. The compulsory education system needs to change and students should be also encouraged to learn soft skills that exist in our country. We need an education which allows students to learn weaving, or art, dyeing or agriculture from an early age.Anukampa 2020 |102Save the Weave103Anukampa 2020 |103 Smriti Irani in Conversation with Sadhguru Save The Weave Speaking to the Union Minister of Textiles and Minister of Women and Child Development Smriti Irani on National Handloom Day (August 7), Sadhguru showed the way forward by providing the following suggestions: India's certification process for organic textiles should be made compliant with international standards so that our handloom products are acceptable to the global audience. A policy should be formulated making it mandatory to use handmade, natural fibers for students' uniforms in Government schools. The style and design of the uniforms should be indigenous to the respective states. Sadhguru added that when children wear handmade cloth, they will learn to appreciate and value indigenous designs and the rich legacy of Indian weaves will live on. Reputed designers can be given tax incentives to sell indigenous handloom products. Sadhguru said that our aesthetics should evolve beyond the standardized, smooth feel of synthetic textiles and we should instead opt for the unique texture of handmade cloth that is beautiful by itself. He added that handloom is not just a way of making a living but making someone else's life. A Government policy should be put in place to dedicate 30% of the land to fiber cultivation by 2030. This will provide a huge relief to the farmers because they would have a product which is profitable and non-perishable. The Minister welcomed Sadhguru's remarks and suggestions before speaking about several vital changes the Textile Ministry has instituted to make weaving a commercially viable proposition for weavers.Anukampa 2020 |104Isha Gramotsavam Isha Gramotsavam was launched in 2004 to empower individuals, transform communities, and inspire people for positive change.

For the safety of the people running the crematoriums, we had taken extra care by making arrangements for some of them to stay at the respective crematoriums so that they could extend their services without break. PPE, hand sanitizers, hand gloves, masks, and other disinfectant materials have been provided at all our crematoriums. The volunteers prepared food, beverages and Nilavembu Kashayam within the premises to avoid outside contact and infection. All our staff and their family members cooperated wholeheartedly to ensure uninterrupted service during this time. The staff who fell into the high-risk category were given paid leave for the duration of the pandemic. Family members of the deceased were very appreciative and grateful for the way the crematoriums functioned.Anukampa 2020 |108 Anukampa 2020 |109 \"I went to the Isha Kayantha Sthanam for the first time in 2011 when my father-in-law expired quite unexpectedly. The manner in which rituals were carried out moved me and since then I visit the crematorium often to lend a shoulder to people who are there to cremate a loved one. In March 2020 when I was at a hospital to help a friend whose mother was undergoing dialysis, I saw a young man, Swaraj, 23, running helter skelter with a little baby in his arms. I learned that his wife, Jyoti, 22, was in critical condition in the ICU and he was alone with nobody to help. I was moved by his predicament and for four days I supported them by bringing food and fruit juice daily. I even collected some money from my friends and gave it to Swaraj since he was facing financial difficulties. On the fourth day, however, Jyoti died and Swaraj was crying inconsolably. Since he had brought his wife for treatment to Coimbatore in a hurry, he did not have proper documents and the hospital authorities refused to hand over his wife's body. I asked my husband to help and we went with Swaraj to his hometown and got all the relevant documents. Since Swaraj did not have enough money, I called up the in-charge at the Isha crematorium and he assured me that in this case no money is required. When we reached the crematorium, people were already waiting for us. They received us with care and while Swaraj was inconsolable in grief, they took care of the final rites.From the moment we entered the crematorium everything was taken care of by the staff there who behaved like caring relatives. The deceased's body was placed respectfully in front of the Kalabhairava statue, flowers and turmeric were offered. As incense smoke enveloped the area, I felt that Kalabhairava was blessing the deceased. We did not know what religion or caste or what rituals the deceased's family followed, we just knew that the deceased was much loved by her family members and that was enough for us. Many people face this predicament on a daily basis and in other crematoriums they would have been forced to cough up a lot of money. Here, in Isha crematoriums, Swaraj did not need to pay money because of his financial condition and the deceased was cremated with immense respect. This place is not just a crematorium; it is a temple where people pay their last respects to the departed. I have told my children that when I die, my body should be put in front of the Kalabhairava statue and my final rites should be performed at the same Isha crematorium.\"Chitra Sivakumar Social Worker/Beneficiary This place is not just a crematorium; it is a temple where people pay their last respects to the dead.Kayantha SthanamAnukampa 2020 |110 An Appeal This project aims to develop and maintain eco-friendly crematorium facilities across the state of Tamil Nadu, which are open to people of all socio-economic and religious backgrounds.

To assist people during these times, Isha offered its flagship program Inner Engineering Online free to the COVID Warriors which included medical professionals and police. For all others the program was made available at half the price. The cry for help of distressed people who were stuck at home due to the lockdown resounded across the world and found a reflection in registrations for the online course.

Ghatanji is a troubled area where water scarcity, people's distress and farmers' suicides had become a norm. Hope is blooming again in the hearts of the local people since Isha volunteers arrived to help revive the Waghadi River and improve the ecological and socioeconomic conditions of the local residents. The holistic approach of the team to ensure the transformation of Ghatanji also includes conducting Yoga and Inner Engineering (IE) programs. Ghatanji became one of the first places in the country to host the IE program in Marathi language for the locals. The first program kept the Isha volunteers on tenterhooks because till four days before the first session, only eight people registered. However, due to the passionate efforts of our volunteers who visited every household in Ghatanji, we were able to register 110 people. The villagers infused the class with exuberance and happy energy. The class proved to be miraculous for the whole community which went through a fantastic transformation.Inner Engineering in MarathiRural Yoga Programs Offered for the first time in Ghatanji, Maharashtra\"The first Marathi class in Ghatanji was really a special experience for me. There were almost no local volunteers here. But we had our Nadi Veeras who have braved extreme summers (temperatures shoot up to 48 degrees Celsius) and acute water scarcity. I had the privilege of working with this fantastic group of young Nadi Veeras. With sheer fire in their hearts, they have transformed themselves. Out of the 34 of them who are in Ghatanji, only a handful can speak Marathi while all others manage with Hindi. But the level of trust they have gained in the village is simply incredible. The first challenge we faced was the rundown condition of the hall where the IE class was to be conducted. The hall authorities did try to clean it but failed to have much impact. Then the volunteers swung into action and slowly the place started changing. Within hours the place was totally transformed. With meager resources, they had made the hall and even the surrounding area feel like a sacred space. When the class began, right after the introduction, I felt a surge of energy among the participants. I looked around during the break and it felt like a festival with everybody's faces bright and smiling. Personally, for me it was like living a dream that I did not know would ever become a reality. A lady was almost in tears while sharing how big an experience it was for her. The villagers were so excited to attend the class that they came straight from the fields where they had been working since 4 am in the morning. Some of them cycled more than 10 kilometers to reach the class. The innocence and openness with which they participated in the class really touched me. Many times I felt that Sadhguru was holding all of them with love, like little children. On the last day, one of the participants shared, 'I thought I came here to learn some Yoga, but I never thought it would change my life and above all change me as a person from within. I feel that this is just the beginning. Very soon the whole village is going to change.'Tejas Isha Yoga Instructor I am so grateful to have witnessed this miracle unfolding in this remote part of Maharashtra that has seen such enormous suffering for years.Anukampa 2020 |119During these unusually challenging times of a global pandemic, having a robust immunity and a well- functioning respiratory system is of paramount importance. Simha Kriya is a powerful Yogic process designed by Sadhguru as a support for our health. It offers multiple health benefits - strengthens our respiratory system and immunity, and builds samat prana, which acts like an armor to help the practitioner resist negative impacts.Anukampa 2020 |120Free Yoga Programs Amplifying Immunity with Simha Kriya Anukampa 2020 |121 \"I am an Indian citizen residing in an emirate of the UAE. One of my colleagues developed fever with mild symptoms of COVID-19 towards the end of April and was isolated soon afterwards. After five days, tests revealed he was COVID positive. As his roommates, we (four of us lived together) were also isolated and tested. We all tested positive but were asymptomatic. Our company decided to shift us to a hospital for further treatment. However, since we were asymptomatic positive cases, the hospital decided to quarantine us in hotels. Life in quarantine was boring. I was alone in the hotel room, struggling with fear and stress. Samples were being taken every four days but results continued to be positive for 24 days. Though I didn't show any symptoms, I was still worried. I started to eat a lot of oranges, lemons and ginger, etc. to improve my immunity, but there was no improvement. On 22nd May, when I shared my concerns with my best friend, Ravi Kumar, he suggested I try the Simha Kriya. And, I started practicing the Simha Kriya 4 to 5 times a day. Astonishingly, my sample on the 24th May turned out to be \"negative\" - after more than 8 positive results! I kept on practicing the Simha Kriya. A second sample was taken on 26th May which also turned out to be negative. Simha Kriya had worked wonders for me by improving my immunity and taking me out of COVID as well as the frustrating quarantine. I would like to thank my friend for suggesting this and I can say with confidence that if practiced with sincerity, Simha Kriya will help improve your immunity and breathing capacity.\" Name withheld for privacy I can say with confidence that if practiced with sincerity, Simha Kriya will help improve your immunity and breathing capacity.Free Yoga ProgramsOnline Webinars 193 Upa-Yoga sessions 11,362 People attended 48 Online Public Sessions 90,000 Participants Upa Yoga The pandemic may have partially hampered our plans for conducting in-person programs, but we soon found a way to resume our activities, while adhering to all the safety measures and lockdown rules.

During the last 28 years the program has served not just inmates but also jail officials and staff. This program is offered free of cost to prisoners at various sites in India and the United States. This program presents the possibility of achieving inner peace and freedom for the inmates. The program helps inmates develop emotional and mental balance, responsibility, acceptance, and communication skills. These learnings not only improve their lives while incarcerated but provide tools to successfully cope in society once released. Prisoners develop an inner awareness which helps them examine the roots of their aggression and violent behavior and handle the complexities of their imprisonment. These life- transforming programs have touched the very core of the prisoners and have helped them bloom into a natural state of love, freedom, and joy - free from anger and hatred. Over the years, these programs have transformed many hardened criminals into sage-like beings.Prison Yoga Programs \"After participating in a 3-day Isha Yoga program, I experienced a lot of difference within me.

During the interaction, Sadhguru spoke about icons like Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela who used their prison terms for inner transformation and made lasting contributions to humanity. Stressing on the futility of resisting the inevitable, Sadhguru said that prisoners must work towards creating a joyful state within themselves regardless of external circumstances. Sadhguru demonstrated the mechanics of the mind through interesting experiments and interactions. He also answered several questions from the prisoners related to mental wellbeing and dealing with crippling negative emotions such as fear, loneliness, guilt, shame and anger. \"I first attended a Prison Yoga session in 2001 and the journey has been as transformational for me as for the inmates. Recently, on one occasion when we were conducting a program for prisoners of a Central Jail, a woman approached me and said that Isha Yoga has helped her maintain her mental balance during her time in prison. She shared that when she first came to the prison she used to be very upset but the practices kept her going. One of the most impactful experiences was when during a seven-day Prison Yoga program, one of the inmates came and showed reluctance to attend. He said that he should be excused as he will get bail the next day and will not be able to complete all the sessions. But, I reasoned with him and convinced him to attend even if it was for one day. On the third day he was still there, and while sharing his experience, he confessed that though he was reluctant to take part initially, he has been praying every night before going to bed that his bail petition should not be approved for another few days so that he gets to complete all the sessions.\"Swami Udaaradhi Isha Yoga Instructor An Online Session with Sadhguru Since 2008, I have been conducting Prison Yoga programs.
