About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Worldwide, lung cancer is one of the most common cancers, with NSCLC making up 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancer cases.20,21 The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.22 Among the most common driver mutations in NSCLC are alterations in EGFR, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase controlling cell growth and division.23 EGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of Western patients with NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients.22-28 EGFR ex19del or EGFR L858R mutations are the most common EGFR mutations.29 The five-year survival rate for all people with advanced NSCLC and EGFR mutations treated with EGFR TKIs is less than 20 percent.30,31 EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are the third most activating EGFR mutation.32 Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have a real-world five-year OS of 8 percent in the frontline setting, which is worse than patients with EGFR ex19del or L858R mutations, who have a real-world five-year OS of 19 percent.33 RYBREVANT\u00ae IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION2 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion Related Reactions RYBREVANT\u00ae can cause infusion related reactions (IRR); signs and symptoms of IRR include dyspnea, flushing, fever, chills, nausea, chest discomfort, hypotension, and vomiting. Based on the safety population, IRR occurred in 66% of patients treated with RYBREVANT\u00ae. Among patients receiving treatment on Week 1 Day 1, 65% experienced an IRR, while the incidence of IRR was 3.4% with the Day 2 infusion, 0.4% with the Week 2 infusion, and cumulatively 1.1% with subsequent infusions. Of the reported IRRs, 97% were Grade 1-2, 2.2% were Grade 3, and 0.4% were Grade 4. The median time to onset was 1 hour (range 0.1 to 18 hours) after start of infusion. The incidence of infusion modifications due to IRR was 62% and 1.3% of patients permanently discontinued to Premedicate with antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids and infuse RYBREVANT\u00ae as recommended. Administer RYBREVANT\u00ae via a peripheral line on Week 1 and Week 2. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during RYBREVANT\u00ae infusion in a setting where cardiopulmonary resuscitation medication and equipment are available. Interrupt infusion if IRR is suspected. Reduce the infusion rate or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT\u00ae based on severity. Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis RYBREVANT\u00ae can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. Based on the safety population, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT\u00ae, with 0.7% of patients experiencing Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis. Three patients (1%) discontinued RYBREVANT\u00ae due to ILD/pneumonitis. Monitor patients for new or worsening symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold RYBREVANT\u00ae in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed. Dermatologic Adverse Reactions RYBREVANT\u00ae can cause rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus and dry skin. Based on the safety population, rash occurred in 74% of patients treated with RYBREVANT\u00ae, including Grade 3 rash in 3.3% of patients. The median time to onset of rash was 14 days (range: 1 to 276 days). Rash leading to dose reduction occurred in 5% of patients, and RYBREVANT\u00ae was permanently discontinued due to rash in 0.7% of patients. Toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in one patient (0.3%) treated with RYBREVANT\u00ae. Instruct patients to limit sun exposure during and for 2 months after treatment with RYBREVANT\u00ae. Advise patients to wear protective clothing and use broad spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen. Alcohol free emollient cream is recommended for dry skin. If skin reactions develop, start topical corticosteroids and topical and/or oral antibiotics. For Grade 3 reactions, add oral steroids and consider dermatologic consultation. Promptly refer patients presenting with severe rash, atypical appearance or distribution, or lack of improvement within 2 weeks to a dermatologist. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT\u00ae based on severity. Ocular Toxicity RYBREVANT\u00ae can cause ocular toxicity including keratitis, dry eye symptoms, conjunctival redness, blurred vision, visual impairment, ocular itching, and uveitis. Based on the safety population, keratitis occurred in 0.7% and uveitis occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT\u00ae. All events were Grade 1-2. Promptly refer patients presenting with eye symptoms to an ophthalmologist. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT\u00ae based on severity. Embryo Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal models, RYBREVANT\u00ae can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of RYBREVANT\u00ae. Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions (20%) were (22%). The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (2%) were decreased lymphocytes (8%), decreased albumin (4%).
