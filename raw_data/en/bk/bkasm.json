Aromatherapy Top 4 Ways Of Using Aromatherapy In Your Practice Essential oils can be a beneficial addition to any massage. | | Top 4 Ways Of Using Aromatherapy In Your Practice Diffusers distributes essential oil molecules into the air, which gives anyone walking into the space beneficial exposure. A diffuser that allows you to change oils quickly is ideal. Diffusers driven by an electric fan use a pad to apply a few drops of oil, and the pad is placed beneath the fan compartment. This type of diffuser allows for a quick change of oils if a therapist encounters a client who finds the current oil offensive to their senses. There are many diffusers on the market, enabling a therapist to purchase one that meets their specific needs. Have a variety of oils on hand so the single oil can be added as needed. Single-note essential oils, such as lavender or Roman chamomile, can be used to enhance relaxation or alleviate a depressive mood. A couple drops of the essential oil added to 1 ounce of carrier oil is all that is needed to complete a full, relaxing therapeutic session. Use Blends the same way you use a single-note essential oil. Just place a few drops of the ready-made blend into 1 ounce of a massage carrier oil. Massage the oil into the clients trouble areas or use it on the whole body. A great example would be using a muscle blend of Helichrysum and Wintergreen on an athlete who is complaining of muscle aches. Blends are a group of essential oils that usually have the same chemical components, thus creating a stronger blend. Some common blends to keep on hand would be muscle blends, relaxation blends and rejuvenating blends. It would also be helpful to have special blends on hand for fibromyalgia, sinus pain, and tension and migraine headaches. For therapists who don't have ample training or knowledge of blending, there are many massage mediums on the market that have essential oils already added for you. Therapists who have ample training can pre-blend massage creams for clients to purchase and continue self-care aromatherapy treatments at home between their therapeutic sessions. This allows them to get the most complete results from their aromatherapy. Therapists who are not trained in blending can purchase pre-blended creams here. Some common retail products that clients may enjoy include diffuser single-note essential oils or diffuser blends, fibromyalgia creams, muscle relief creams and headache or sinus roll-ons.
