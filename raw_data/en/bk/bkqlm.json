However, they are some of the most powerful plant-based tools available. Using the principles of Chinese herbal medicine and formula strategies, we create personalized essential oil blends for our patients. By borrowing from the strength and long history of Chinese medicine, we are able to get more profound results than other methods of using oils. Furthermore, by putting the oil blends onto acupuncture points, we can further individualize the treatment and magnify the effects. We also prescribe inhalation, diffusion, and internal use where appropriate. As with our herbs, we use only the highest quality essential oils available. We only source genuine and authentic oils from reputable suppliers, including Original Swiss Aromatics. Our pharmacy stocks over 50 essential oils, and is designed to provide individualized, custom essential oil prescriptions for your health needs. "}
