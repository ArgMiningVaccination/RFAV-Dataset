Our campus community is [highly vaccinated and boosted](https://www.scu.edu/preparedscu/health-and-safety/covid-19-dashboard/) against COVID-19, which reduces the risk of serious illness and hospitalization and allows us to welcome new and returning Broncos to a comprehensive in-person college experience. Except for programs that have been approved to be online, classes will be offered in person. We will rely on vaccination, testing, and masking to limit spread of the COVID-19 virus, and we will monitor conditions in our region to adjust campus protocols if needed. Testing Before students come to campus: When arriving on campus: - Everyone is required to complete a COVID-19 test the day they arrive on campus (Day 0) and again on Day 3 or 4. - Beginning September 12, Color PCR test kits and collection bins will be provided in the following buildings: - Benson, Charney, Dowd, Guadalupe, Lucas, Heafy, Kenna, SCDI, and Vari. During move-in through Week 1, September 12 - September 23 only, Color PCR tests will also be collected in residence halls. - Tests will be picked up at 3 p.m. (Color is a PCR lab test with results in 24-72 hours; [register for Color](https://home.color.com/create-account?next=%2Fcovid%2Factivation) using your SCU email address). Please use Color PCR testing for arrival testing. - If you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 90 days, you should take a rapid antigen test instead of a Color PCR test. Rapid antigen tests will be available at the Health Ambassadors table. - Stop by the Bronco Health Ambassadors table, located outside of the [ Learning Commons](https://www.scu.edu/map/) Monday 9/12 from 11am - 1pm, and Thursday 9/15 through Sunday 9/18 from 11am - 3pm, to take a test and ask questions. Testing during fall quarter: - Please take a test when you have symptoms, 3-5 days after you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, when you return from traveling, or before you see vulnerable or high-risk individuals. - Color PCR tests and rapid antigen tests will continue to be available for [students](https://uitsendy.stanford.edu/prod/l/ZVQvBZT7qpMfuLHOhvq6Rw/2B2qdxEgKsvFJl892yAoNW2Q/WCQ4FyCdPnwCsWEkBpMlXw), faculty and staff throughout the quarter. Find more information about when and where to get tested on the [Prepared SCU testing protocol ](https://www.scu.edu/covid-19-testing/)webpage. Isolation and Quarantine If you have been exposed to COVID-19, you do not need to quarantine. Get tested 3-5 days after exposure and please wear a mask for 10 days. If you test positive, you must [report your positive test result](https://scu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8IhxJpww6Yk64ZM), isolate for at least 5 days, and continue wearing a mask for 10 days. Students who are positive for COVID-19 may not attend in-person classes. A negative rapid test is required to end isolation before 10 days. Please review the University's [isolation protocols](https://www.scu.edu/isolation-and-quarantine/) for detailed instructions. Students living in on-campus housing will be contacted by the SCU COVID Support Team with instructions for isolating in place, returning home for isolation, or transfering to SCU isolation housing. Isolation space is limited and will be assigned using a triage approach based on student needs and space availability. Face Coverings Masks are required in classrooms and the Cowell Health Center. Students and faculty are required to wear a mask in the classroom at all times unless a pedagogical exception has been granted. Eating and drinking are not allowed in classrooms. Although not required in other indoor locations, masks remain highly recommended. SCU recommends that all students, staff, faculty, and visitors wear a mask that covers the mouth and nose when indoors on SCU property. Masks remain a simple and effective way to reduce exposure to COVID-19 and other airborne viruses. KN95 masks are available at multiple locations across campus including the Health Ambassador's table, Benson Memorial Center, Campus Safety Office, Cowell Center, Residence Halls, Charney Hall, Lucas Hall, the Learning Commons, Guadalupe Hall and at the JST front desk. Surgical masks are available in classrooms. Vaccinations and booster doses All students, faculty, and staff are required to be fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19. At this time, SCU requires the primary series and one booster. The updated Omicron booster is recommended, but not required. Questions regarding individual student records may be submitted to the [Cowell Center](mailto:cowellcenter@scu.edu). Employees should upload their vaccination documentation to [Workday](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/human-resources/documents/workday/Uploading-Your-Vaccination-Card.pdf). SCU will host two Covid-19 booster shot clinics on September 22 and November 3 at the Locatelli Center. Protect yourself from COVID-19 this fall and winter with the updated omicron booster. The booster is appropriate for everyone who is at least 2 months past their last dose of the vaccine (whether the initial series or a booster), or as soon as you have recovered from a COVID-19 infection. Registration and appointment information for the September 22 booster clinic will be available next week on the Prepared SCU website. The clinics will be for SCU staff, faculty and students only. There is no cost, and no insurance is needed. You must bring your SCU ID, state issued ID, and your vaccination card to the clinic. The Cowell Health Center will also host a drop-in flu vaccine clinic on September 22 from 9 a.m. - 3 p.m at the Locatelli Center. Flu shots will cost $25 per person and can be paid using cash or check. COVID-19 Dashboard SCU monitors positive cases on campus and results are shared weekly on our [COVID-19 Dashboard](https://www.scu.edu/preparedscu/health-and-safety/covid-19-dashboard/). Event Planning The Fall 2022 Event Guidelines were shared in the [ faculty and staff update on August 18](https://www.scu.edu/aug2022-facstaff-update/).
