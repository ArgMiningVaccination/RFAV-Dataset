As the owner, my truth is to reflect my gifts in the world, and inspire others on their healing journey. My education comes from many sources; formally I attended the College of Botanical Healing Arts in Santa Cruz and received a Bachelor's degree in Social and Behavioral Science from California State Monterey Bay. I am a business member of the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy. I integrate my Lakota & Yaqui heritage as a foundation for interacting with the sacred medicine of the plants. Stacey L.

My experience with \"Transform\" was like an invitation to dance with my soul's truth. We all carry many stories, some good, some bad, that cause us pain, trauma and suffering. We have no need for this lingering emotional debris. With the very first use, Transform lovingly encircled me with strength and courage, journeying right to the heart of a matter that needed to be resurrected and cleared from my being. It is potent and gentle, yet powerful! This oil will transform any medicine story into one of empowerment. Lily Wolf River Song I love the Balance blend so much! I use it all the time and as I'm a Tarot Reader, I especially love to use it before readings. It feels like the energy of the Empress card... feminine, nurturing, nourishing, heart-opening and spiritually and creatively connected. So so delicious and luxurious. B. Piesse This roller ball blend has become an essential part of my night-time routine since it arrived. It immediately provides me with a feeling of being centered and calm. I love each of the EOs in this blend individually, but combined they are truly a powerful support for me as a chronic insomniac. E. Buehler As I'm passionate about nature in all its infinite varieties, I love Moss Botanicals. For years I have tried products that say they smell like \"a walk in the woods\" or a \"day at the beach\", but they are only a perfume unrelated to the scent that implores you to reminisce. I live in Southern Arizona, so I rely on aromatherapy to take me to these retreats when I am not traveling there--say a walk in the woods in Marin County or Big Sur. This particular aroma fills my senses with cedar and pine and an assortment of whiffs on a breeze that I can't quite name. I use it in my vaporizer and will buy the scent to wear as well. I feel calmer and the sensation puts a smile on my face. I can't wait to try all the different aromas available here. Let the adventure begin! Mel Can't say enough good things about Stacey's products. When you use you can really feel the loving energy she puts into each one of her blends. Balance is one of my favorite and I use it almost every day. A local spa carries her products, but I prefer to order directly because she does such a wonderful job wrapping each product (if you ask). They make perfect gifts! Each person I have given one too has been beyond grateful. Thank you Stacey for sharing your passion, skill and love with all of us who are lucky enough to have found your products. M. Sanchez "}
