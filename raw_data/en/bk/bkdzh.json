Division of Health Care P olicy and Researc h, UC DHSC, Aurora, CO ii Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO iii UNIFORM PATIENT ASSESSME NT FOR POST-ACUTE CARE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Purpose Care fragmentation, unsafe care transitions, and the inability to determine the most cost-effective settings for patients discharged to post-acute care (PAC) are all compounded by lack of a Uniform Patient Assessment. This project provides recommendations to CMS on the development of a Uniform Assessment Instrument for PAC to be completed at hospital discharge and ultimately integrated with PAC assessments . The Assessment Instrument is intended to cover the population admitted to all inpatient PAC settings (skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and acute long-term car e hospitals), as well as residential-based PAC (home health agencies, outpatient programs). The three purposes of the PAC Assessment Instrument are: 1) placement decision-making; 2) enhancement of safety and quality of care transitions through transmission of core informati on to a receiving provid er; and 3) provision of baseline information for longitudinal follow-up of health and function. The report was prepared by seven national PAC experts based on a review of existing instruments a nd literature pertinent to public and private programs, as well as disc ussions with other experts and CMS-recommended leaders in the health care industry. While no su ch review could possibl y be exhaustive, every attempt was made to follow referrals and/or iden tify information on assessments of relevance to these purposes. Major Findings 1. None of the three existing CMS assessm ent tools for PAC (MDS, OASIS, IRF-PAI) adequately covers the spectrum of patients a nd the necessary domains to be used across settings, and mapping across instruments is complex. 2. Past and current uniform assessment instru ments (e.g., the Uniform Assessment Instrument (UNAI), Continuity of Care Record (CCR) , VA Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) Referral Form, Health Outcomes Survey ( HOS) Assessment, and others) cover some domains well, but do not yield precise measures across all pa tients in selected domains. 3. For the purposes of discharg e planning, care transitions, and outcome assessment, a mixture of patient/proxy report measures and provider-ba sed measures exist that could be combined from different sources to optimize data validity and minimize burden. 4. In the functional assessment domains, whic h are essential for uniform PAC assessment, measurement methods are in use by health sy stems that drastically reduce burden while improving precision of measurement across the fu ll spectrum of impairment. These methods, termed Item Response Theory (IRT) and Com puter Adaptive Technology (CAT), target the questions for an individual based on the respons es to former questions so that only some items from a larger pool are answered, while scoring all persons on the same metric (see Chapter 5, page 107 for an example of IRT and CAT). Recommendations We recommend a two-staged development activ ity, lasting about one year, leading to an instrument that is ready for us e in national demonstrations. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO iv Stage 1: Instrument Development 1. Specify Domains: Thirty-one (31) domains are recommended for the three purposes of the Uniform Assessment Instrument (see Table 6.1, page 126). Although these domains were chosen based on evidence and consensus from ea rlier studies, a final expert panel review is recommended to assure that they fully c over the purposes of the uniform assessment instrument without excess burden. 2. Testing Functional Measurement Using IRT/CA T: The Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC), developed by Boston Univers ity for functional domains and in use by Merck, HealthSouth, Kaiser Permanente of Nort hern California, and SeniorMetrix, could be used to demonstrate IRT/CAT for functional as sessment. IRT/CAT, which would be most beneficial for measuring function, could be inte grated with measures for other domains as they become available. 3. Select/Develop Measures for Each Domain: Tested and reliable measures for many domains can be adapted from existing publicly avai lable instruments (e.g., VA GEC Referral Form, HOS) or published domain-specific measures . For some domains, additional item development will be necessary, which will require testing questions on small samples to assure both validity and reli ability. Crosswalks to exis ting PAC instruments will be considered during measure development. 4. Automation Platforms and Transmission: We recommend a web-based approach such that the transmitting hospital can log on and conduct the assessment, which can then be accessed by the receiving provider. However, other plat forms for real-time electronic data generation and transmission could be evaluated and considered in this phase. 5. Integrated Uniform Assessment Instrument: A combined uniform assessment instrument would be generated from these concurrent de velopment and testing efforts that includes information for all domains. Stage 2: Beta Testing 1. A sample of hospitals would be recruited a nd trained to complete the uniform assessment on all discharged Medicare benefi ciaries. Local PAC providers would be trained to access the generated information, and development w ould begin on integrating the assessment information into PAC provider assessments. 2. All measures for all domains would be refi ned, including the metrics and item pools that are used for functional assessment using IRT/CAT. 3. Patient responses would be compared with proxy responses for patient/proxy report items. 4. Software and technology would be refined to assure that the completion, transmission, and receipt of the assessment form are as efficient as possible. 5. Care transitions would be studied for improved safety and quality. 6. Longitudinal follow-up at fixed intervals fo r outcome measures w ould be conducted to examine outcomes for different patient conditions and episodes of care. Following beta testing, the Uniform PAC Assess ment would be ready for use in national demonstration activities. By uniformly characterizing patients at hospital discharge, transmitting uniform information to receiving PAC provide rs, and following outcomes using the same measures over time, CMS would be able to exam ine quality and cost for comparable patients across PAC episodes. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 1 Chapter 1 Introduction, Background, and Objectives A. CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND 1. Post-Acute Care Health care following an acute hospitalization, kn own as post-acute care (PAC), is provided in various inpatient settings, includ ing skilled nursing facilities, i npatient rehabilitation facilities, and long-term care hospitals, as we ll residential-based settings, in cluding home health care and outpatient rehabilitation. Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) are nursing homes or hospital-based transitional care units that are certified by the Ce nters for Medicare & Medi caid Services (CMS) to provide Medicare-reim bursable skilled nursing services on an inpatient basis. Nearly 80% of Medicare residents in SNFs receive physic al, occupational, and/or speech therapy, 1 and most of their nursing care is provided by ce rtified nurse's aides. Inpatien t rehabilitation facilities rehabilitati on care; Medicare patien ts receiving inpatient rehabilitation care are required to receive a minimum of three hours of combined physical, occupational, and speech therapy per day, meet certain diagnostic criteria, and demonstrate consistent functional improvement. Inpatient reha bilitation is also charac terized by much greater physician presence, particularly from rehabili tation specialists, and more care provided by licensed and registered nurses. Long-term care hospitals provide intensive care to patients who have multiple comorbidities and require inpatient hospital care over an extended period. Approximately 80% of Medicare patients in long -term care hospitals were transferred from an acute hospital. 2 Long-term care hospitals are the least frequently used PAC setting, with less 1% of beneficiaries discharged from acu te hospitals using these facilities.2 Home health care is provided to Medicare beneficiar ies who are homebound (unable to l eave their residences without considerable and taxing effort) and require intermittent or part-time skilled nursing care and/or therapy services. Outpatient care generally consists of follow-up physician visits and ongoing rehabilitation services or medi cal monitoring that are provided on an outpatient basis. In 2002, approximately one-third of Medicar e beneficiaries discharged from hospitals utilized some form of PAC within one day of leaving the hospital. 3 Within several of these PAC settings, Medicare re quires that patients be evaluated using setting- specific patient assessment instruments for patien t assessment, payment, and quality assurance purposes. The Minimum Data Set (MDS) is used for patients in SNFs, the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility - Patient Assessment Inst rument (IRF-PAI) is used for patients in IRFs, and the Outcome and Assessment Information Set ( OASIS) is used for patients receiving home health care. (These instruments are further di scussed in Section D.) Currently, no standard assessment instruments are required for patients receiving care in long-term care hospitals or outpatient care. 2. Need for Uniform Assessment Instrument In recent years, several federal initiatives have increasingly called for development of a uniform system for patient assessment across PAC settings. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 2 Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report, by January 1, 2005, on the development of health and functional assessments for various Medicare beneficiaries using PAC and other specified services. The legislation specifies that information across pr oviders be readily comparable and that only information necessary to meet pr ogram objectives be collected. Th e Secretary is also required to make recommendations regarding use of patient assessment instruments for payment purposes. In its June 2005 report to Congress, the Me dicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) recommended that data elements be identified for use by CMS in establishing payments and evaluation of patient outcomes across PAC settings, asserting that the data elements \"predict resource use; capture relevant clinical data; be reliable, valid, and well accepted; and minimize the burden to providers and CMS.\" 3, p.119 The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has advised that \"the fede ral government accelerate, expand, and coordinate its use of standardized performa nce measurement and reporting to improve health care quality,\" and that current performance measurement mechanisms within and across government programs be replaced by standard ized measurement and reporting mechanisms. 4, p.79 The recent IOM report entitled \"Performance Measurement: Acceleration Improvement,\" identified a lack of a \"coherent, goal-oriented, consistent, and efficient system for assessing and reporting on the performance of th e health care system\" as one of the most significant obstacles to improving the quality of health care in the United States, calli ng for a concerted national effort to consolidate performance measures a nd reporting activities in health care. 5 In his June 2005 testimony before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, Herb Kuhn, Director of the CMS Center for Medica re Management, stressed the importance of adopting techniques that provide more uniformity and consistency in how patients are assessed and quality is measured across post-acute settin gs in order to minimize care disruptions, allow sharing of patient information across settings, a nd avoid re-hospitalizati ons and other negative effects. 6 He called for collection and comparison of \"c onsistent clinical data across various sites of service,\" and use of those data in an effort to build a coordi nated approach to the payment and delivery of post-acute services that focus on the overall PAC episode. Taken together, these initiatives reinforce the i mmediate need for a uniform system of patient assessment across sites of care - one that promot es highly consistent, coordinated, safe, and effective care for our nation's Medicare beneficiaries. 3. Report Objectives Two central objectives guide the development of th is report: a) to identif y a long-term vision for uniform PAC patient assessment along with short- term, incremental steps for achieving that vision; and b) to identify a co re set of potential measures or measure domains for collection across post-acute settings. These objec tives are further discussed below. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 3 a. Long-term Vision and Short-term Steps: A key objective of this report will be to present both a long-term vision for uniform PA C patient assessment and shor ter-term recommendations for reaching that vision. The long-term vision will re flect the ultimate goal of the ideal strategy for uniform PAC patient assessment if we were crea ting the cross-site assessment without starting from the existing assessment tools. The shorte r-term steps will include practical, incremental solutions toward achieving that goal over time. One short-term option, for example, while somewhat constrained, might involve testing a \"cr oss walk\" between the existing setting-specific instruments for selected domains. Other pos sibly intermediate solutions might involve implementation of an additional assessment - ve ry modest in length and scope - that would contain core elements relevant to all PAC settings . A detailed discussion of specific long-term and short-term recommendations is included in Chapter 6. b. Potential Core Measures fo r Collection across Settings: Rather than making recommendations for an assessment that would re place existing setting-specific instruments, the second objective of this report will be to identify a core set of potential measures or measure domains to be collected across settings - w ith the understanding that within each setting, providers will continue to expand on this core wi th unique information re levant to the patient populations served. Similarly, while the intent will not be to make recommendations for developing a comprehensive care pl anning tool or health record for all PAC patients, the core set of potential measures identified are intended to be relevant and useful to clinicians in providing high-quality, patient-centered care. B. POTENTIAL PURPOSES OF A UNIFORM PAC PATIENT ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT Development of a uniform PAC patient assessmen t instrument could ultimately serve a number of purposes. The major ones include: monitoring quality and outcome across settings over time; informing decisions for placement in PAC upon hospital discharge; facilitating transitions between care settings; serving as a comprehensive care plan and clinical assessment; and serving as the basis of Medicare payment for post-acute services. Any discussion of an assessment instrument, the domains to be measured, a nd measurement methods should be preceded by clearly stating the instrument purposes. No instrument will be perfect for all purposes, so tradeoffs are always required when serving multiple purposes. Thus, this assessment instrument will be developed to address only certain purposes, as described below. The tradeoffs and strengths and limitations for these purposes will be discussed in Chapter 6. 1. Monitoring Quality and Outcomes across PAC Settings over Time One potential use of a uniform assessment tool for PAC patients would be to serve as an accurate, consistent means of tracking health status and outcomes of patients as they move across post-acute settings over time. Because the current setting-specific assessment tools were created for different purposes and often a ssess different aspects of health and functional status (further discussed in Section D), data collected through these instruments are often not compatible - making it difficult to monitor and track patient progr ess (or lack thereof) from one setting to the next. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 4 2. Informing Decisions Regarding Appropri ate Placement in PAC upon Hospital Discharge A number of studies have found that factors other than patients' clin ical characterist ics often play a role in determining the setting to which pa tients are discharged from the acute hospital.7-10 Such factors include geographic location, availab ility of post-acute services, and particularly, payment related factors such as the dischargi ng hospital's organizationa l structure, for-profit ownership, and ownership of PAC facilities. With different Medicare payment systems in place for each of the different post-acute settings (som e of which pay per day, per discharge, or per episode), varying financial incentives exist for the provision of care acros s post-acute settings, particularly for hospitals that al so provide post-acute, in addition to acute, health care services. Few would argue that factors other than the patient's care needs s hould drive the decision regarding PAC placement upon discharge from acut e care, within the constraints of provider availability. At the core of a ll decisions regarding subsequent car e should be the best interests of the patient and his or her caregiver(s). A unifo rm patient assessment could serve as a patient- centered hospital discharge assessment that contains the essential elements needed for appropriate PAC placement decisions. Such a tool would establish a framework for ensuring that discharge placement decisions are based on the patient's condition, functional status, care needs, and care preferences rath er than other incentives. 3. Facilitating Care Tran sitions across Settings As patients are transferred from one care setting to another (or fr om one level of care to another within the same setting), they become particul arly vulnerable to a num ber of potential negative outcomes, with patient safety issues and medication errors of particular concern. 11;12 The continuity of care provided within a given setting can be broken as care transitions occur, often due to problems in communicati ng essential information about th e patient, the pa tient's care plan, and the care provided in the previous setting.13 Because effective care transitions require coordination across settings as well as a reliabl e system for relaying key patient information, another function of a uniform assessment would be to contain a core set of key patient information that would be transferred with the pa tient from one setting to the next. Sharing of this core set of information would facilitate communication between care providers and help to ensure both patient safety a nd continuity of care. 4. Serve as a Comprehensive Care Plan and Clinical Assessment Another potential purpose of a uniform PAC patient assessmen t would be to serve as a comprehensive care plan and clinical assessment for all PAC patients. While such an effort would ultimately tie in with longe r-term initiatives related to elec tronic health records and health information technology, it would prove far too comp lex for the scope of this report and would therefore be better addre ssed within the context of other proj ects designed specifically for such purposes. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 5 5. Serve as the Basis of Medicare Payment for PAC Services The setting-specific patient asse ssment instruments described above serve as the basis for the Medicare prospective payment systems in their respective settings. U nder prospective payment for SNFs, IRFs, and home health care, payments are established based on case mix, using a setting-specific baseline assessm ent and payment algorithm. For SNFs, patients are assigned to 44 groups, referred to as resource utilization groups, version III (RUG-III), which are intended to classify patients according to their needs for nur sing and therapy care as indicated by the MDS. For IRFs, stays are categorized into one of 385 case-mix groups (or CMGs), which are derived based on information collected through the IRF- PAI. And for home health care, patients receiving five or more visits are allocated to one of 80 home health resource groups (HHRGs), which are determined by diagnosis, functional cap acity, and service use information gathered through the OASIS. Because the current setting-speci fic patient assessment instruments are used to establish Medicare payment for PAC services, the natural assumption would be that any newly developed uniform PAC patient assessment would also serve this same purpose. Such a uniform assessment would help to ensure that payment is established consistently and equitably across different sites of PAC according to the patients' clinical characteri stics and health care needs, as well as services provided. This type of system would also place more of a focus on an episode of PAC, rather than the individual pr oviders within those car e episodes. While addressing issues of payment for PAC is no doubt an ultimate priority for CMS, the scope of this project does not include an exploration or dire ct discussion of payment-related assessment issues. However, information generated through this work will no doubt prove useful in subsequent payment- focused endeavors. 6. PAC Assessment Purposes Addressed in this Report In summary, of the five uniform patient asse ssment purposes discussed above, the development of this report and the recommendations herein ar e guided by three. These include: 1) assessment of patients' health and functiona l status at the time of hospita l discharge in order to support appropriate placement into post-acute settings; 2) f acilitation of care trans itions from the hospital to PAC and across post-acute settings; and 3) asse ssment of health and f unctional status of PAC patients across settings over ti me for quality monitoring. C. EXISTING ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS Each of the setting-specific patient assessment instruments introduced in Section A has unique origins in terms of conceptuali zation, development, and proposed uses. In addition, each was constructed using different methodology, resulting in use of different terminology, definitions, and rating scales, as well coverage of different domains and elemen ts of care. These differences ultimately limit the tools' utility for cross-site assessment. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 6 1. Development and History of Setting-Specific Instruments a. MDS: As part of the Omnibus Budget Rec onciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA), Congress mandated a national, uniform system for assessi ng all nursing facility residents by October 1990.14 In 1988, the Health Care Financing Admi nistration (now CMS) contracted with a consortium of researchers to develop and test a uniform resi dent assessment system, which culminated in creation of the MDS. The MDS wa s initially developed as an assessment tool to identify resident care problems that are addresse d within individual residents' care plans, but over time, the use of the MDS expanded to include both payment and quality monitoring/improvement functions. As previ ously mentioned, information collected through MDS serves as the basis for Medicare reim bursement under the SNF prospective payment system. Data collected through the MDS are also compiled in the form of quality indicators, which are now used to monitor care quality and identify potential care problems. Quality indicator data are used by providers in their effo rts to improve quality of care, by state surveyors in identifying potential problem areas for re view, and by CMS for long-term quality monitoring and program planning purposes. In addition, as part of the national Nursing Home Quality Initiative launched in 2002, quality indicator info rmation is also availabl e to the public via the Nursing Home Care web site (www.med icare.gov/NHCompare/Home.asp). b. IRF-PAI: The IRF-PAI consists of items from th e Functional Independence Measure (FIM), which was developed as the functional assessm ent instrument portion of the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilita tion (UDSmr). The concept for the UDSmr was initially developed in 1983 by a task force formed by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medi cine and Rehabilitation. Funding for further development was provided by the National Institute of Disability and Rehabilitation Research, and the UDSmr was established by researchers at th e State University of New York at Buffalo in 1984. 15 The UDSmr consists of four components: 1) a data set used to assess disability severity and medical rehabilitation outcomes; 2) computer software; 3) a data management service for subscribing facilities; and 4) a training program for users. The IRF-PAI was implemented on January 1, 2002, and now serves as the basi s for Medicare reimbursement under the IRF prospective payment system. Through the UDSmr system, the IRF-PAI also serves a program evaluation function in that it allows for ongoing monitoring of pa tient outcomes and comparison of outcomes across facilities. c. OASIS: Developed by the Center for Health Services Research at the University of Colorado in the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s (with funding provided by the H ealth Care Financing Administration and the Robert Wood Johnson Founda tion) the OASIS items were designed to measure, assess, and encourage improvement in care outcomes over time using Outcome-Based Quality Improvement (OBQI) processes.16-18 Collection and transmission of OASIS data became a requirement for all Medicare- certified home health agencies in 1999. Using OASIS data, reports presenting aggregated, risk -adjusted, descriptive, and adve rse event patient outcomes are provided to all certified home h ealth agencies; these reports permit agencies to compare their own outcomes with those of other home health ag encies throughout U.S., enabling them to target their quality improvement efforts and monitor pr ogress over time. With the implementation of the prospective payment system for home health care in October 2000, information collected via the OASIS was also used for case-mix adjustme nt in establishing Medi care reimbursement. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 7 Overall, the OASIS is used for outcome m onitoring, payment, and as a core but not comprehensive clinical assessment. 2. Comparison of Existing Tools The MDS, IRF-PAI, and OASIS differ in terms of the elements they assess, their assessment periods, and their rating scales. A recent empi rical comparison of the MDS, IRF-PAI, OASIS and the physical function scale of the Short-Form-36 (an assessment sometimes used with ambulatory care populations) revealed differences between and limitations within each of the instruments in terms of thei r content, breadth of covera ge, and measurement precision. 19 An analysis by Rogers et al., found that the these tools use different terminology and definitions in describing functional ability, as well as different measurement scales for quantifying disability.20 Similarly, a review by Bryant et al. revealed th at the setting-specific instruments assess different health domains, and that items within common domains differ in perspective, qualification, source, and time periods covered.20;21 D. PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP UNIFORM PAC PATIENT ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS In recent years, several initia tives have set out to develop a nd implement uniform systems for assessing PAC patients for a vari ety of purposes. Table 1.1 provi des information regarding six of these initiatives, including the Continuity of Care Record (CCR),22 the Uniform Needs Assessment Instrument (UNAI),23 the Medicare Post-Acute Care (PAC) Quality Measurement Instruments,24 the VA Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) Referral Form,25 the Care Transitions Measure (CTM),26 and the Personal H ealth Record (PHR).27 As outlined in Table 1.1, several of these instruments - including the CCR, UNAI, VA GEC Referral, and PHR - contain key pieces of patient information needed fo r appropriate planning and provisi on of care. Others, including the CTM and Medicare PAC Quality Measurement Instruments, were designed to assess various aspects of health care quality. The CCR, U NAI, and VA GEC Referral were designed for completion by the health care provider, while the PHR, CTM, and Medicare PAC Instruments were designed to incorporate patient responses to some extent. Table 1.1 includes information regarding the intended purpose, implementation status, date developed, assessment timeframes, and domains assessed for each of these six assessment tools. E. CHALLENGES OF UNIFORM PAC PATIENT ASSESSMENT Development of a uniform patient assessment in strument presents many challenges, some of which include gaining provider support, minimizi ng burden, coordination with electronic health record initiatives, and pr acticalities of longitudinal follow-up. In addressing all of the following challenges as well as others, the authors' approach will be to identify short-term, practical recommendations that will bring us incrementall y closer to achieving our long-term vision of uniform PAC patient assessment. This approach will provide a road map, in essence, for taking us from where we are now to an optimal uniform assessment approach across settings.

Gaining Provider Support In order for any uniform assessment instrument to be effectively implemented, it will be imperative that both acute and post-acute provider s support the use of the instrument. Critical steps toward achieving this support will be to ensure that the data elements incorporated are useful to providers in carrying out their day-to-day patient care re sponsibilities (i.e., in terms of care planning, improving quality of care, etc.) and that the burden of data collection is minimized. Financial rewards based on completi on of the instrument (i.e., through a pay-for- performance initiative) would also provide an additional incentive for provider compliance. Engaging provider representatives in the developm ent process always enhances buy-in, but must be managed so that the proce ss does not become prolonged. 2. Minimizing Burden A key factor in the success of uniform assessment instrument will be to keep burden of data collection (for both patients and pr oviders) to a minimum. By including only a core set of essential measures to be collected across pos t-acute settings - which can be supplemented by relevant setting-specific data elements as deem ed necessary - the length of the instrument and the time required for completion can be minimize d. However, we are trying to address three different purposes with the instrument, which will require tradeoffs to keep burden to a minimum. 3. Coordination with Electronic Health Record Initiatives With increasing importance being placed on the us e of health information technology standards and electronic health records to improve the he alth care quality, coordination, and efficiency of care, this movement must be considered in the development and implementation of a uniform PAC assessment instrument. While the focus of this report will not be to address the specifics of electronic data collectio n, entry, and transmission, the authors recognize the importance of formulating recommendations that are complementar y to and consistent with the aims of health information technology and automation. 4. Practicalities of longitudinal follow-up In devising a uniform tool for quality and outcome monitoring acr oss post-acute settings over time, key decisions will have to be made in terms of appropriate in tervals for assessment, appropriate respondents (i.e., prov ider, patient, proxy, or a combination of the three), and mode of data collection. Such decisions are comple x and will require thorough consideration of many factors, including how the results will be re ported and when, who w ill be responsible for collecting and assuring quali ty of the data, and psychometric a nd quality measurement issues.

INTRODUCTION Medicare provides insurance cove rage for many types of care, which when used in succession constitute episodes of care. A bout 20 percent of all beneficiaries are admitted to a general acute hospital during a year.1 In addition, Medicare covers other types of hospitalizations which are used less frequently by the ge neral populations, but for hospi tal discharges with certain conditions, a high proportion may be transferred from the general acute or directly admitted to inpatient rehabilitation fa cilities (IRFs), psychiatric hospita ls, and long- term care hospitals. Many hospitalized beneficiaries ar e transferred to a skilled nurs ing facility (SNF). More importantly, all SNF admissions are transferred in from one of these hospital beds. About 39 percent of the hospital discharges will go on to use home health agency services during a year. These services may be in addition to, or in pl ace of outpatient therapy services. The outpatient services may be accessed thr ough a hospital outpatient depart ment, rehabilitation agency, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation fac ility, or independent therapist's office.2 These sequences make up typical PAC episodes (Figure 2.1). While beneficiaries may transfer across this con tinuum or enter PAC at different points, these providers are generally expected to be delivering different levels of care. General acute hospitals are seen as sites that treat acute illnesses or acute exacerbations of chronic illnesses. They diagnose, treat, and discharge patients typically within four to six days.3 Long-term care hospitals are also acute hospitals but their pa tients typically have l onger lengths of stay, averaging admissions of about 25 days. They sp ecialize in patients with respiratory conditions, rehabilitation needs, or psychiatric illnesses.4,5 IRFs, on the other hand, specialize in only acute patients who need inpatient-level, intensive rehabilitation therapy. Their admissions are comprised primarily of orthopedic, neurological , and other specialized cases requiring physical therapy, occupational therapy, or nurs ing (both rehabilitation and medical).6 SNFs admit patients who may need less intensive rehabilitati on therapy following IRF service use, or who may be too ill to be admitted to an IRF and/or need nursing services and conditioning. Outpatient therapy settings and home health agencies provid e these same therapy services to patients who do not require inpatient care; those who ar e home-bound may also be accessing nursing, home health aide, and social worker services in their home. Many of these providers have the same types of staff but provide different levels of services.7 Each have physical therapists, speech and language pathologists, occupational therapists, nurses, and physicians but the inte nsity of the service provided varies by setting.8 Because of these overlaps, the Medicare Payment Assessment Co mmission (MedPAC) and its predecessor, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (Pro PAC) have been calling for consistent measurement across settings si nce at least the mid-1990s. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 16 Figure 2.1: Post Acute Care Transitions, total Medicare service utilization . SOURCE: Gage , of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 17 But much of the early research to develop PA C case mix measurement systems has been done by separate research groups, each with expertise in their respective PA C service area. Hence, as the new PAC prospective payment systems (PPS) we nt into law in 1997, CMS used the case mix systems, payment methods, and measurement tools that had been developed for each service over the prior decades. Today, the general acute, long-term care hospita l (LTCH), IRF, SNF, home health (HH), outpatient, and psychiatric payment systems each have their own, distinctive case mix systems. The most closely aligned are th e general and long-term acute hos pitals that both use the same diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), although the pa yment weights differ for the two payment systems. The psychiatric hospital PPS builds on th is system but adjusts it with measures appropriate for those populations. The IRF, SN F, and HH systems are independent, despite the overlap in types of services provided, and none are based on the DRG system. Each was developed by experts in th eir respective service areas. This chapter compares the patient assessment tools currently used in the Medicare program to measure case mix differences within each PAC sett ing and contrasts them across settings. These tools are important for monitoring beneficiary access, quality of care, and appropriateness of admissions in each setting. Ideally, if the measurem ent systems were consistent across settings, these types of tools could be used to monitor patient transf ers and outcomes across settings. However, none of these tools were desi gned to measure patients across settings. This chapter will compare the tools currently in place, identify similarities and differences in measurement and application, and discuss the rese arch that has been conducted or is needed before a uniform tool is available for PAC assessments. B. OVERVIEW OF THE TOOLS The BBA and subsequent legislation establishe d several new PPSs that use patient assessment data to adjust base payment rates for each re spective provider. However, each system uses a different patient assessment tool: Skilled nursing facilities use the MDS or minimu m data set for skilled nursing facilities; Home health agencies use the OASIS or Outcomes and Assessment Information Set tool; Inpatient Rehabilitation Faciliti es use the IRF-PAI or IRF Patient Assessment Instrument. Long-term care hospitals do not have an assessm ent tool but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are cu rrently conducting a study to deve lop criteria to distinguish these hospitals from other types of acute inpatient hospitals.7 This study is examining the tools used in the private sector to determine \"level of care\" definitions. These levels are used by the quality improvement organizations (QIOs) and some private insurers as guidelines to authorize services in different settings. They are based on medical severity, functional impairment levels, and treatment needs. Outpatient therapy provi ders do not submit patient assessment information but the SF-36 is sometimes used to m easure function in this population. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 18 1. History and Development As noted in Chapter 1, the three tools (MDS, OA SIS, and IRF-PAI) were developed by different parties for different purposes. While two of th e tools, the MDS and IRF-PAI, were developed for use with inpatient popul ations, these populations diffe r dramatically. The MDS was originally developed for a long-term care popu lation with high cognitive and functional impairments while the IRF tool was developed fo r use with an acute, in patient rehabilitation population. The latter had to be strong enough to undergo at least three hours therapy across five days/week. The third tool, OASIS wa s developed for use with homebound, post-acute populations. Both the IRF and HH populations are relatively healthy compared to an institutionalized long-term care resident. While the MDS has evolved over time, the original form was emphasizing factors related to frailty while the other two forms have always been applied to more acute populations. The MD S now applies to both LTC and post-acute populations in nursing facilities. Each of these tools have different histories. a. The MDS: The MDS grew out of the long-term car e field as a care planning and quality monitoring tool for long-term care residents in nursing f acilities. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 1987) directed CMS (then HCFA) to develop a care planning tool for long-term care facilities participati ng in the Medicaid program. The law identified specific components to be included in such a tool . This tool incorporat ed recommendations from hundreds of experts in geriatrics, psychiatry, therapy, social work and residents rights advocates (Mor, 2005).9 CMS funded a consortium of research ers and practitioners to develop what became known as the MDS for nursing homes.(1) The Katz ADL scales were used as the basis of this instrument (Katz, 1983).10 OBRA 1987 further mandated that a data collection system be established to monitor quality of care in long-term care facilities, particularly in the Medicaid program. As policymakers began discussing a PPS for SN Fs, the MDS was turned into the existing instrument used in facilities that often have both long-term care and skilled nursing units.(2) 11 Variations of the MDS were tested with VA a nd other populations and eventually led to the development of companion tools for home health (MDS-HC) and other services. Today, these have evolved into a suite of tools develope d by the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) consortium to measure functional improvement potential, institutional risk, communication disorders, cognition, depression and anxiety, so cial function, cardio-respiratory, dehydration, falls, nutrition, pressure ulcers, palliative care , reduction of formal services, and urinary incontinence.12 In general, MDS items focus on health conditions, cognitive impairments, other complicating conditions, such as communication, psychiatric, a nd pain issues as well as necessary nutritional approaches other than se lf-feeding, skin conditions , and special treatment needs, such as chemotherapy, dialysis, ostomi es, tracheostomies, transfusions, ventilator management, Alzheimer's units, podiatry, or hospice care; in other words, frailty factors that are more common in the long-term care population. The MDS documents other frailty factors such as whether the patient is comatose, delirious or has behavioral symptoms, such as wandering, (1) This consortium was lead by Catherine Hawes of RTI, International and included Brant Fries of the University of Michigan, John Morris of the Hebrew Home for the Aged, and Vincent Mor of Brown University. (2) In 1992, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission reviewed the range of tools used in nursing facilities. (See ProPAC, 1992). Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 19 agitation, or other factors that w ould require restraints or closer monitoring. CMS is currently considering revisions to the MDS and where app licable, those modifications will be discussed here. b. The OASIS: As noted earlier, the OASIS was orig inally developed by the University of Colorado as an outcome assessment tool for hom e health care. Most of the items were developed under research co-funded by CMS and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The tool, which evolved over the last decade, now includes additional items that are useful for clinical assessment and care planning in additio n to outcomes monitoring, but it is not intended as a comprehensive assessment. The target population is in a home environment where issues such as personal assistance and environmental safety are as important as individual health status and functi onal status. This tool collects data on living arrangement s, medical conditions, neurologi cal, emotional, behavioral conditions, ADLs, IADLs, and self-management issues, such as pati ents' and caregivers' abilities to manage medications a nd equipment, such as oxygen, IVs, and tubes. In addition, data are collected on prior hospitaliza tion and emergent care needs. Like the MDS, assessments are primarily c onducted by nursing staff although therapists also contribute where appropriate. The OASIS can be used to help the nurse assessor develop the patient care plan, including requests for assessme nts by other professionals, such as occupational therapists to assess the home environment, physi cal therapists to assess the level of therapy needed (if any), social workers to assess the fa mily and other types of support available to the individual, and aides, including the types of assistance needed.(3) This same tool is used for planning services in both the Me dicare and Medicaid programs desp ite differences in the extent of insurance coverage for unskilled assi stance, such as home health aides. c. The IRF-PAI: Medicare's IRF-PAI tool grew out of an effort to improve measurement of functional impairment for inpatient rehabilitation patients with various diagnoses, but all of whom needed physical medicine and rehabilitati on. A task force was formed in the early 1980s, which reviewed existing scales and functional assessment instru ments. Under funding from the National Institutes of Disability and Rehabili tation Research (NIDRR) coupled with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJ), an effort was made to select the most common and useful items for rehabili tation clinicians to assess severity of disability in a uniform and reliable manner. The final result, th e Functional Independence Measures (FIM)TM was based on the Barthel Index13 modified to include communication an d cognition items. The scales were modified from three levels to seven levels, and the weights were removed.14 The FIMTM tool is an additive scale comprised of 13 physical motor skill items and 5 cognitive or communication items, each rated on a seven-point scale measuring degree of dependence and frequency of need for assistance. The IRF- PAI supplements these items with diagnostic information, personal support information, and ce rtain quality indicators. The focus is on measuring impairments in a group th at is strong enough (i.e ., not frail) to participate in intensive (3) Medicare only covers aide services if intermittent or part time skilled services are needed (nursing or physical therapy or on-going occupational therapy). Medicaid, on the other hand, provides home health aide services in many states. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 20 therapy nearly every day. CMS has recently completed a study to modify the items to better measure quality in the IRF setting. Where applicable , those modifications will also be introduced in the following discussions. These assessment tools must be completed on every Medicare admissi on in the respective setting. The MDS is completed on all Medica id and Medicare covered nursing facility admissions, the IRF-PAI is completed on all Medi care covered inpatient rehabilitation facility admissions, and the OASIS is completed on all Me dicaid and Medicare covered home health patients. 2. General Measurement Issues While the three tools were designed to assess different populations, they all collect the same types of information to varying degrees. Thes e can be grouped in five basic categories: Administrative information - Demographics - Insurance coverage Social support/reside ncy prior to admission - Type of Residence - Level and Type of Assistance Received Medical diagnosis and conditions - Active medical conditions - Complicating conditions, such as skin, respiratory, pain issues - Special equipment needs (tubes, oxygen, dialysis, etc.) Functional limitations - Activities of Daily Living - Instrumental Activities of Daily Living - Physical mobility - Cognitive impairments a. Tool Composition: While these five categories are sh ared by the assessment tools, the domains, actual items, item definitions, scor ing methods, and metrics differ across tools.15 Some differences exist because of the emphasis of a respective service. For example, the IRF-PAI is the shortest form and emphasizes the medical and functional needs of the patient. Its functional measures (FIM scores) are based on a modified Barthel Index which builds on the ADL concepts but measures what a patient does and their need for supervision, not a measure of what the patient is capable of doing and expands the mobili ty measures to better capture small increments of change in the rehabilitation population. The OA SIS, which is used in the home environment, is a longer form because it includes the health and functional domains but also adds items on need for (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) and level of assistance available in the home. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 21 In addition, the OASIS collects information on th e medical conditions for which the patient was recently hospitalized since these may not be the reason for the HH admission but they could affect the HH treatments. The MDS is the longe st form and it collects a limited number of medical and functional impairment measures but a large number of items on special equipment, neurobehavioral issues, such as cognitive impairme nts, memory recall, and propensity to wander. Thus, even when the domains of health and f unction are consistent acr oss tools, many of the items used to measure them differ. Each of the items will be discussed in more detail below as they affect the viability of a uniform PAC assessment system based on today's tools. b. Assessment Timing: In addition to specific items varying across tools, the three systems also differ in terms of when a patient is assessed. Ideally, this information would be collected at admission and discharge so one could measure the severity of illness or impairment levels and use them to determine appropriate admissions, appr opriate discharges, and to measure the impact of each treatment. However, each tool collects data on a different sc hedule (Table 2.1). While all three tools collect data \"at admission,\" only the OASIS assessor records on the da y of admission. In IRFs, the admission period may vary across three days and in SNFs, across eight days. The SNF admission has interim assessments at 14 days and 30 days and every 30 days after that until coverage ends at day 100. The OASIS has a follow up assessment every 60 days and both OASIS and IRF-PAI include a discharge assessme nt, but one is not required in the SNF. Table 2.1: Frequency, time period covered, and measurement scales differ across post- acute patient assessment tools required by Medicare Dimension Inpatient rehabilitation facilities Skilled nursing facilities Home health agencies Long-term care hospitals Tool IRF-PAI MDS OASIS None Frequency of assessments At admission and discharge Initial (day 1-8); day 14; day 30; and every 30 days, up to day 100 Initial at admission; every 60 days thereafter; and at discharge Time period covered Lowest level within first/last 3 days (for admission and at discharge) Generally 7-day look-back Status of patient on day of assessment Method of assessment Directed observation preferred but can be combined with reported performance Information gathered for multiple caregivers' descriptions and documentation.

IRF-PAI Training Manual.16 and MedPAC Report to the Congress17 Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 22 The tools also vary in terms of whether the asse ssment is judging health and impairment levels on the day of assessment or for some prior pe riod, as in the case of the IRF-PAI and MDS assessments. This can lead to more subjective re cordings than direct observation at the time of assessment. According to past st udies, the three tools also vary in how long it takes to complete them.17 3. Item Comparisons While many of the domains are similar across the tools, the actual items used to measure the domains differ substantially. Each of th ese areas are compared below (Table 2.2).

Administrative Information: Each tool collects basic demographic information on the patient including age, gender, social s ecurity and insurance numbers. Th ese data are fairly standard across all tools and could be used to merge datasets. b. Social Support Systems/ Residence Prior to Admission: The types of social support questions vary across the three tools. The two to ols used with the health iest population, the IRF- PAI and OASIS, both identify where the patient lived prior to admission, who they lived with, and in the OASIS, the degree of help these peop le provided to the patient prior to admission. The IRF-PAI also asks where a patient will be discharged and with whom they will live after discharge. The latter does not specify whether the co-residents will provide assistance or the frequency of assistance available, which is the information the therapy staff needs to understand the level of achievable independence. (4) In contrast, the MDS collects information on the resident's residential history over the five years prior to ad mission, whether they lived alone (Y/N/Other facility), an d upon discharge, the type of setting they will be entering. As reflected in the variation of the current tools, certain se ttings require additional information that may not be relevant to all settings, such as the IADLs in the OASIS. However, to the extent they are collecting the same types of information, the curr ent tools do not currently use the same items. Despite the similarities in the domains in th e IRF-PAI and OASIS, they currently ask very different questions. The IRF-PAI collects informa tion on the patient's pre- hospital living setting. Included in the response groups are both commun ity-based residential options and responses answering where the patient was admitted from, including three types of hospitalizations (IRF, LTCH, and general acute).(5) The OASIS questions target mo stly community-based options to determine whether the person lives alone or with ot hers, and if the latter, the relationships they have. Both forms ask who the patient lives with but the responses are coded differently, with the (4) RTI proposed changing this item to be more cons istent with the OASIS item in its IRF-PAI modification recommendations to CMS. (5) RTI also recommended to CMS that this item be replaced with the OASIS items. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 26 IRF-PAI only distinguishing between being alone, with any family, with friends or with a hired attendant. The OASIS categories are similar co nceptually but offer di fferent choices, which identify whether the family member is a s pouse. These two items could conceivably be crosswalked, or alternatively, if the IRF-PAI QI recommendations go into effect, both forms will use the same codes. More importantly, OASIS asks about the type of assistance given by the primary caregiver and by whom. Again, it was recommended that these items be added to the IRF-PAI since they describe the type and frequency of resources that will be available if they are discharged home. The extent of available help is significant in pr edicting the probability of discharge home from an IRF.6 In contrast, the IRF-PAI c ontains discharge items that collect the same information as the admission set (i.e., discharged where and to live with whom) but this does not describe the degree to which their co-residents will be willing to help them.6 The MDS collects information on where the patient is admitted from and their discharge status. While the admission and discharge groups are consistent within the MDS, they offer more choices than the IRF-PAI or OASIS in terms of subsequent health care settings. This information, if reliable and consistent in the future, could be useful for tracking utiliz ation patterns an d care transitions across setting. c. Medical Conditions: Each tool collects information on the patient/resident's medical conditions. They differ in whether they specify the primary condition for which the patient is being treated and the degree to which they use open-ended items. Close-ended items increase the ability to compare across patients and tools bu t they also include some assumptions regarding the most common conditions. d. Active Medical Conditions : The IRF-PAI and OASIS use open- ended items requesting ICD- 9 codes to identify the medical c onditions that need to be treate d while the patient is receiving that service. In addition, the OASIS also asks ab out recent past diagnosis . First, the OASIS asks for a list of ICD-9 codes for conditions treated in an inpatient facility during the last 14 days (M0190), the codes requiring a ch ange in HH treatment regimen (M0210), and the codes for which the patient is being treate d in home health (M0230/0240). Th is last one has a four-point severity index applied to it which designates wh ether the symptoms are controlled and to what degree they need adjustment or have had re lated rehospitalizations because of it. In contrast, the IRF-PAI collects only the ICD-9 codes related to the admission (22) and up to 10 comorbid conditions (24). On the IRF-PAI, the a ssessor is directed to li st the most complicating comorbid conditions but they are also trained to fi rst list the ones that will result in a payment adjustment. Hence, the reported comorbiditie s may under-represent conditions being actively treated or may not reflect those causi ng the greatest medical problems. The MDS, on the other hand, gives a list of dis eases and infections commonly found in long- term care cases (I.1 and I.2) and as ks the assessor to identify if a disease or infection is related to the resident's current ADL status, cognitive or behavioral status, medical treatments, need for monitoring, or risk of death. This list is not as specific as ICD-9 codes, which also can reveal the location or severity of a condition as well as the type of illness. In addition, the MDS provides an open-ended item to list two other current dia gnoses and ICD-9 codes (I.3.). The 3.0 MDS (6) This was also a recommended IRF-PAI change so that this information would be collected for IRF patients. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 27 version proposes to replace these items with ICD-9 codes, which will make these three forms more consistent in terms of conditions assessed. Severity is currently measured on the MDS in a general overall question (Item J.5.) rather th an specific to an individual ICD-9 code. e. Complicating Conditions: The tools vary in how they identify complicating conditions. Each of them list different conditions, or where th ey list the same type of complicating condition, it is often measured differently. For example, a ll three tools measure whether the patient is in pain, has skin conditions, such as ulcers or woun ds, and their respiratory status. These are each important measures because they can reduce a pa tient's ability to participate in treatment independent of the severity of the primary illness. This changes the expected outcomes and levels of treatments that can be provided during a stay. As a result these have the potential to be important risk adjusters when examining case mi x differences within and across settings. They also may explain differences in site of care used or le vel care needed. i) Pain items: The IRF-PAI uses a ten-point scale that notes the worst level of pain documented on any shift during the prior three-da y assessment period. In contrast, both the MDS and the OASIS document the frequency of th e pain but use different measures. The MDS notes (M0420) whether a) no pain or not interfere with activity or movement, b) less than daily, c) daily, but not constant d) all the time or M0430) is in tractable. OASIS captures this in two items. J2a asks frequency (no pain, less than dail y, daily) and J2b asks intensity (mild, moderate, excruciating). While the \"excruciating\" OAS IS item may be comparable to the MDS \"intractable\" item, this has not been tested. Further, the two \"daily\" responses may not be measuring the same level of frequency as one iden tifies the pain as \"dail y, but not constant\" and the other tool is silent on whether the daily pain is constant or not. ii) Skin conditions: Skin conditions are sometimes consid ered a quality indicator although it is difficult to determine when a skin condition actua lly began developing, and therefore, difficult to use as a quality measure. 6 Each tool measures the type a nd degree of skin conditions with different items. The MDS section M addresses skin problem s through a set of six items identifying: 1. Number of ulcers at each of the four stages during last seven days and as identified through a body exam, 2. Whether each ulcer identified in #1 is a pressure or stasis ulcer, 3. History of unresolved ul cers in last 90 days, 4. Other types of skin problems in last se ven days including abrasions/bruises, rashes, desensitized skin spots, t earing, and surgical wounds 5. Whether any skin treatments were provided in the last seven days including special chairs, turning programs, nutritional or wound care progr ams, or other preventive activities 6. Series of foot and nail problems during the last seven days. The OASIS asks a different series of questions about the current skin cond ition and whether the patient has a wound or ulcer (M0440s), the number and stages of ulcers (M0450), and the stages Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 28 and status of: a) pressure ulcer s (M0460s), b) stasis ulcers (M 0470s), and c) surgical wounds (M0480s). Measures are only reported on the most pr oblematic ulcers rather than all ulcers as in the MDS. The IRF-PAI is similar to the OASIS in that it as ks for information on the worst ulcer rather than all ulcers but it also measures the severity of the ulcer ba sed on width, exudation amount, and tissue type using the PUSH tool. Effectively, it is the most specific documentation of skin conditions although only for the worst conditions, un like the MDS, which me asures the severity of each ulcer. This is a growing field of science that has been developing nurse certific ation and standards of practice for effective wound care management. On e way to standardize the elements used to measure ulcers and skin conditions is to compare the current tools with the measures currently being developed in this field. Skin care trea tment is an important preventive measure since patients with ulcers range from those with multip le, infected wounds needing treatment in an acute care setting, such as a long-term car e hospital to wound management for a homebound person who may need debridement through an outpa tient therapy setting, a fairly non-threatening condition that has the potential to become more severe. iii) Respiratory conditions: Like the skin conditions, re spiratory conditions are often complicating conditions in the more severely ill populations as well as primary diagnoses. Certain hospitals, like long-term care hospitals and some rehabilita tion hospitals have specialized programs to treat patients with these conditions, including the use of special equipment such as ventilators. While ventilator w eaning may occur in the LTCHs a nd some IRFs, nursing facilities may provide ventilator management for longer term residents. Mo re information than whether a patient is on a ventilator is needed to distinguish be tween these levels of care. Less intensive respiratory conditions are also noted on these forms. On the IRF-PAI, three questions currently exist that document whethe r the patient is short of breath in exertion, at rest, or has a weak cough or difficulty clearing ai rways at admission and discharge (N/Y items). The OASIS has two items (M0490 an d M0500), which ask whether the patient is short of breath at different stages of exertion and whether they are using respiratory treatments such as oxygen, ventilators, or continuous posit ive airway pressure. While the OASIS M0490 is more specific than the IFPAI items 48-50, they could be crosswal ked to answer whether the patient is short of breath under exertion or at rest or not at all. These questions ta rget the healthier patient who has respiratory complications but not severe impairments. The MDS records shortness of breath in items J1 (problem conditions) wh ere it is noted if a patient has shortness of breath du ring the last seven days or an inability to lie flat due to shortness of breath. It also documents under sect ion P whether the resident has had ventilator support or suctioning over the last 14 days. f. Special Equipment/Treatment Needs: The third major domain under medical issues relates to the use of special equipment or special treatmen ts. The IRF-PAI documents the smallest number since these patients are the healthiest. The IR F-PAI measures difficulties with swallowing (item 27) and whether the patient requir es modified food cons istency or supervision or the use of a tube or parenteral feeding either part ially or completely for sustenance. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 29 The OASIS documents tube/PTN feeding needs in two different sections. Under ADLs, (M0710) measures the level of ability to feed oneself (pri or and current) and identifies whether assistance is needed and level of assistan ce (setup, supervision, modified diet ). Responses range from able to feed self independently to unable to take in nutrients orally or by tube feeding. In addition, M0810 asks whether the patient needs assistance with equipment, including feeding, oxygen or IV/infusion therapy. It specifically refers to ability, not willingness a nd rates the patient on a four-point scale. A similar question is aske d of the caregiver's ability to manage the three types of equipment (M0820). In addition, OASIS uses a three-point item to measure the patient's ability to take oral medications (M0780), inhalant/mist medications (M0790), and injectable medications (M0800). In complement to these medical issues, the OASIS also asks about the patient's prior and curr ent abilities to complete their Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). The MDS documents similar issues such as the nutritional approach (K. 5.) and the proportion of intake associated with tube us e (K6.) but it also documents much more medically intensive needs than the IRF-PAI or OASIS. J1 lists a set of pr oblem conditions that range from weight changes to dehydration to shortness of breath, edema, fever, internal bleeding, lung aspirations in the last 90 days to hallucinations and delusions. In addition, section P asks whether the patient has received any of a set of treatments in the la st 14 days, including ch emotherapy, dialysis, IV medications, ostomy care, radiation, suctioning, tr acheostomy care, transfusions, ventilator or respirator support, Alzheimer's special unit serv ices, hospice, respite care, or alcohol and drug treatments (P1). In addition, th erapies in the last seven days are tracked, including physical, occupational, speech, respiratory, and psychologi cal therapies (P2). The MDS also tracks whether the nursing staff has provided at least 15 minutes per day of range of motion or mobility training during the last seven da ys. Other items in the P sect ion document whether, and how frequently, restraints have been used; frequency of physician visits and orders in the last 14 days, and whether the patient is likely to be discharged within a 90-day period. These items target services for both the medically complex pa tient and the long term, frail patient. g. Functional Limitations: All three instruments contain items to assess functional status, although each tool relies on differe nt items to elicit this inform ation (Table 2.3). These three instruments are similar in their shared clinical concern with functional improvement. Despite these similarities, the information collected is not entirely comparable across the three instruments.18 The FIM instrument sums two subscales measurin g the motor and cognitive independence levels. These scales are based on seven-level ratings of independence in each item including, eating, grooming, bathing, dressing, toileting, sphincter control, transfers, and locomotion. The FIM also measures comprehension, expression, and cognitive items such as social interaction, problem solving, and memory. All items are scored for their highest levels of dependence (from total independence to total dependence with varyi ng levels of assistance between level 1 and 7) during the three prior days for an admission and discharge assessment. The MDS uses a different set of functional items with a different scoring system. It measures functional impairment using a five level measure of ADL support provided during the last 7 days of the assessment period (no suppor t, setup only, 1 person assist, 2+ assist, or did not occur) in Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 30 bed mobility, transfer, walking, locomotion, dres sing, eating, toilet use, personal hygiene, and bathing. The OASIS uses different scales to measure func tional impairment at two points in time - prior to admission and currently (on the assessment day) . It uses eight ADL measures with a four- level response scale. The four levels measure ability and level of assistance needed. They range from no assistance needed to materials must be placed within reach to individual assistance needed to total dependence on someone else. While each of these tools are well-respected in their respective fields, little work has been conducted to apply them across set tings. In recent years, several studies have tried to compare the functional measures on these three tools. They differ in whether they modified the tools, created a crosswalk using statisti cal methods, such as Rasch anal ysis, or collected data on one sample using multiple forms.

This tool, the MDSPAC, modified the MDS incorpora ting information from both the MDS and the MDS-home care. It differed from the FIM in how data were collected (input from multiple respondents, including al l caregivers in addition to patient and family), the scoring system (multiple dependent episodes instead of just lo west dependency level during the three day look back period) and scoring range from 0 to 6 in re verse order of the seven-point scale used in the FIMs. In addition some of the scoring for ADL a ssist codes were changed to incorporate whether the patient was weight-bearing.19 The study had mixed results. A factor analysis on items combined from both instruments found that the or iginal MDS items did not load onto the same factors as the FIM's, while the revised MDS items had higher agreement with the FIMs items. However, the greatest agreement was achieved when the calibration teams actually collected data on the same patient using both forms. Despite this, when the team mapped the MDSPAC and the FIMs items into the IRF payment cells, the cla ssification agreement levels were low. As a result, CMS opted to retain the FIM for use in the IRF. Another study used the current MDS to develo p a pseudo-FIM score for patients in IRFs and SNFs. 20 This study used an expert panel to cro sswalk the FIM and MDS functional items. Data were collected in six nursing homes on rehabi litation patients. The FIM was administered by Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 33 therapists and nurses while the MDS was administ ered by nurses as is currently the practice. MDS levels were rescaled based on the TEP input to create pseudo-FIM measures. Ten FIM items had corresponding MDS items (eating, tran sferring bed to chair, toileting, bathing, grooming, bowel and bladder incontinence, prob lem solving, expression, and comprehension). Three FIM items were judged as not available on the MDS (climbing stairs, tub/shower transfer, toilet transfer). The TEP also disagreed on whether the walk/wh eelchair FIMs item was equivalent to the MDS locomotion item since the latter incorporated distance. The cognitive FIMs items appeared to be relate d to several dichotomous MDS ite ms so they and the three FIMs items without an MDS equivalent were dropped from the analysis. The results showed high levels of agreement (no significant difference in mean scores) on 8 item s (eating, transferring, toileting, dressing, grooming, bladder control, me mory, and problem solving. In testing the subscales, the researchers found a bias where su bscales were higher (less impaired) for FIMs than pseudo-FIM on the motor and ADL subs cales and lower on the cognitive subscales suggesting a ceiling and floor effect on certain items in the FIMs. This is consistent with earlier work which found there were no major ceiling effects, but certain patients those with lower level amputations and major multiple trauma groups, were unable to climb stairs and therefore their ratings were misleading. Similarly, patients tended to score higher at admission in eating, grooming, and the five cognitive items suggesting small ceiling effects. 21 While the FIM serves as a valuable assessment inst rument in its inpatient rehabilitation facility setting for which it is intended, it lacks sufficient va riation in functional status in order to be used across the range of PAC settings.22 The FIM primarily defines the distinctions within the lower levels of functioning where individuals with th e greatest level of impa irment score. The resulting concentration of scores at the higher end of the FIM s cale constitutes a ceiling effect.23 While these tools are effective with the populations they were intended to address, they may mask variability when applied to other patients. As noted by Steinman et al, the floor and ceiling effects could be addressed by adjusting the defini tion of an item so that more people could be measured on it. Application to populations that ar e either too disabled or too able bodied could be misleading in that it would appear no functional gain occurred. Items would need to be added that would reflect much more diffi cult and much less difficult activities.21 An alternative approach has been used by Kramer et al., in which all thr ee instruments have been mapped back to the Barthel (modified because stairs are not included on the MDS). In one study, IRF and SNF patients with hi p fracture and stroke were asse ssed at PAC admission using the Barthel Scale, demonstrating substantially higher (more independent) Barthel scores in IRF patients than SNF patients. 24 More recently, the IRF-PAI, MD S, and OASIS scores for stroke patients were mapped to the Barthel Index, de monstrating the greatest independence among HH patients, moderate independence among IRF patients, and least independence among SNF patients.25 This mapping to the Barthel Index, however, requires further validation. More work needs to be done to obtain consensu s and test the comparability of these measures.26 Some work is underway collecting information us ing multiple tools on one set of patients. One study is collecting information on 600 patients using the FIMs, MDS ADLs, and the OASIS functional measures to create a crosswalk that can be used across settings.27 Other researchers are interested in developing item banks that pr ovide measures independent of setting and build Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 34 on the WHO ICF framework.23 These types of studies can provi de the tools needed to compare patients' functional limitations i ndependent of site of care. C. MISSING ELEMENTS FROM TOOL The above discussion highlighted some of the is sues in trying to standardize the types of information collected on PAC admissions using th e current tools. The three existing tools are only used with the IRF, SNF, and HH admissions . However, as shown in Figure 1, these same types of cases may be discharged to long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). Often these cases are more medically complex than those admitted to IR Fs but not always since the hour therapy rule has no intensity requirement. Both types of hospita ls may wean a patient from a ventilator or provide rehabilitation services, depending on the region of the country. However, LTCHs do not currently submit any assessment data. As a result, they do not consistently document health or functional limitations in their patients. A recent RTI study collected assessment tools from a survey of LTCHs to identify the types of factors monitored to de termine treatment needs. 7 Many of the factors we re similar to the MDS special treatment section. Items documented the us e of ventilators, types of dialysis machines (peritoneal or hemodialysis), oxygen therapy, su ctioning and tracheostomies. However, they also collect more objective measures of patient intensity, such as respiratory rates, stability of hemodynamic measures and other factors that meas ure intensity and the need for higher level monitoring or other services. This is particularly important when considering levels of care and determining whether a ventilator patient on certain drugs belongs in an ICU, LTCH, or IRF. LTCHs varied in their collection of function it ems. Some LTCHs collected FIMs items while others used measures more similar to the MD S measures. Most were measuring performance rather than assistance provided. However, there a ppeared to be no standard measure of function across LTCHs. These clinical and functional f actors are important for many reas ons. In addition to patient management, they are also useful to the Medi care program management. Many of these factors are used by the QIOs to assess appropriatene ss of acute hospital admi ssions, including LTCH admissions. Their current criteria are based on private sector effort s to develop \"level of care\" definitions. These systems use clinical measures such as comorbidities, blood and oxygen levels and equipment needs such as tubes, drips, and ve ntilator weaning or management. The ventilator items are particularly important because differe nt levels of medical attention are needed by patients who are on a ventilator and being weaned versus the one who is being managed. The current indicator in the MDS does not distinguish between the two le vels of intensity for patients on ventilators. These private sect or efforts are similar to the RA I suites that have grown out of the MDS, but again, the measures have their basis in the medical rather than long-term care field. D. CONCLUSIONS The ultimate long-term goal of this effort is to create a minimum data set that collects standardized information on medical and functio nal status across set tings, with additional components specific to each setting. Of utmost importance is the minimizing reporting burden. These data sets should be minimal so that the quality of care, outcomes, and case mix can be Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 35 tracked across settings wit hout creating undue paperwork bur dens. However, the limited research to date has shown that the current m easures have each been designed to evaluate patients at a certain level of function. As st ated in the beginning, IRF and HH admissions are likely to have greater strength and mobility than SNF admissions who likely have medical conditions and greater frailty, complicating any rehabilitation needs. And by definition, HH patients are likely to be healthier than SNF admissi ons in that the latter have to meet the needs for 24-hour nursing care. Developmental work remains before we can crea te a unified assessment instrument. Logically, one would expect to develop new items that could build on each other to cr eate better measures of a domain that can cross settings and provider levels of care. The Wo rld Health Organization has begun to build on this concep t in their new taxonomy of disa bility and impairments. Through multiple governments and collaborating centers , the WHO is developing a 3,000 plus item pool to classify human functioni ng at the body, person, and so cial interaction levels.28 When ready, this taxonomy can provide a set of measures that when used across the three levels can measure similar body impairments at different levels of physical and social lim itations. It will be important, however, to have a minimum standardi zed set of items if one of the goals is to compare cases across an episode of care. In the short term, the current system needs to be refined to allow continued use of the items included in the payment algorithms while still improving the ability to standardize case mix measures across settings for other purposes. The two most difficult areas to achieve consensus in are those measuring medical sever ity and functional impairments. By definition, the populations admitted to IRFs are \"healthier\" medically than those admitted to SNFs or LTCHs. They must be able to sustain thre e hours therapy per day, on average. Admissions at LTCHs are typically most medically complex as the average length st ay is much longer than in other acute level settings and past work has documented the diffe rence in severity between LTCHs and SNFs. The work that is currently underway to build crosswalks in functi onal measures by using multiple forms on the same patients will be importan t in building an item bank that allows one to move across a wider continuum of measurement. These represent one type of effort to allow measurement across settings as beneficiaries continue to be discharged from one setting to the next lower level of care. In a ddition, research is needed to de velop a refined item bank that can be used for uniform functional assessment. E.

Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 39 Chapter 3 Review of Uniform Assessment Items and Tools for Ambulatory and Hospital Settings A. OVERVIEW Providers, researchers, and h ealth systems have explored a plethora of approaches to standardizing and improving the assessment of olde r adults. In this chapter, we will identify, from among these approaches, those domains that are commonly included in efforts to measure important patient characteristics, outcomes, and ba sic transitional care needs. We will also provide examples of some items that are used to measure these domains. We will then discuss some of the challenges that have been encountered in measuring these domains. Finally, we will review the content of some ava ilable assessment tools and appro aches that have been proposed or tested in ambulatory and hospi tal settings. Although the list of measures and assessment tools is too extensive to review in its entirety, this review involved an attempt to identify the most widely used assessment instruments and measur es outside of those tools used under Federal mandates, including instruments used fo r managed care and private initiatives. This review will focus on those assessment domains and related items that might further the potential goals for a hospital discharge assessm ent instrument. As outlined in Chapter 1, a standardized assessment might be used to measur e those patient characteristics that significantly influence outcomes as patients receive care in di fferent settings over time. By assessing these characteristics, providers are be tter able to anticipate their patients' outcomes and improve their quality of care. Another goal of a standardized hospital disc harge assessment might be to improve discharge care planning. By assessi ng those factors that in fluence the patient's discharge outcomes, care and support needs, providers might be tter tailor discharge recommendations to meet their patients' need s. A third potential goal for a standardized discharge assessment is to improve care transitions by identifying patient characteristics and care elements that allow subsequent care providers to best manage care. The remainder of this chapter will focus on domains, items within domai ns, and examples of existing assessment tools that have been identified, either in the medical literature or in expert opinion, as important for meeting one or more of these potential goals of a hospital discharge assessment instrument. B. POTENTIAL DOMAINS Multiple domains have been included across standardized patient assessments. The large number of recognized fact ors that contribute to important health outcomes1, 2 can be divided into four groups\u2014demographics and socio-economic status (SES);3-10 function;10-16 health behaviors and preferences;7, 17-19 and diagnoses, conditions, and associated treatments.15, 17, 18, 20-24 1. Group I: Demographic and SES Domains An individual's age influences his or her respon se to disease and chances of functional recovery, decline and death,25-29 even after accounting for ot her patient characteristics.8, 13, 17, 19, 24, 30-36 As a result, age is included in many assessment models or scoring systems.11, 18, 37-39 Care guidelines and care recommendations for preven tive and screening services ofte n are targeted to particular age groups. In addition, age has been associated with differences in care quality and access.40-42 Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 40 Gender and marital status have b een associated with differences in health outcomes, may play some role in patient discharge choices, and are relevant for future medi cal care. Male gender may be protective for some outcomes,43 but is associated with increased risk for others.40 In addition to variations in diseas e incidence and prevalence, both quality of care and proclivity to report symptoms may vary by gender.42, 44-47 Marital status may in fluence health states,48, 49 choice of discharge setting,50 and may provide relevant info rmation for future providers. However, the relationship can be complex and interacts with gender an d the health of the caregiver.48, 50, 51 Measures of caregiver availability and social support may be more important for predicting future needs, access, and discharge planning.37, 52, 53 The importance of language for effective communi cation and health litera cy is clear and is relevant for interpreting survey responses, scoring cognitive tests, and discharge planning.54-56 The role of race and ethnicity, independent of language, is more complex. These factors continue to be associated with differential access, poor care transiti ons, care delivery and quality, 50, 54, 57-60 although care reports from some sett ings offer hope th at these quality differences can be eliminated.60-65 As such, race and ethnicit y are relevant for monitoring disparities in outcomes. Race and ethnicity have al so been associated with differences in health beliefs, behaviors and content of self-report.56, 64, 66, 67 These associations poi nt to possible utility for care planning, care transitions, and identifyi ng best items for a standardized assessment. Finally, race may independently influence dis ease prevalence and outcomes, with various analyses showing differential disease progression and medication response, even after controlling for quality an d other risk factors.68-70 Pharmacology sometimes uses race as a crude proxy for applied genomic pharmacology.71-73 Education, health literacy, and in come are important influences on health outcomes and access to services.7, 17, 32, 74, 75 In addition, education a nd literacy influence patien ts' ability to comprehend and adhere to discharge in structions and to answer particular assessment items.55, 76 2. Domain Group II: Functional Status Many widely accepted health models emphasize function over disease and define important disability as the functioning of i ndividuals within their environment.77 Function potentially clarifies the severity a nd impact of self-reported medical c onditions in the geriatrics population.78 Several guidelines advocate documentation of functional status on admission to hospital or physician practice.79 Functional status is a broad dimens ion of health, and several scales are available for measuring functiona l limitation and disability. Func tional measures can be divided into three large groups: measures of physical function, measures of the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and measures of th e basic activities of daily living (ADL).(1) Although many tools have items from all of these domains, mo re recent scholarship treats them as separate functional domains, at least for purposes of meas urement. We will discuss each group separately below. (1) This grouping is used to facilitate practical review of existing instruments. The WHO International Classification of Impairments Disabilities and Handicaps employs a concep tual framework in which disease can lead to three general functional outcomes: impairment, disability, handic ap. While we are aware of this model, it is not employed in this review. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 41 Physical function or performance measures ai m to capture underlying impairments and range from ability to accomplish gross physical activities such as climbing stairs80 to measures of dimensions of physical activities such as strength, range of motion, and speed.25, 30, 81, 82 The most commonly used measures focus on lower extremity strength, mobility and balance.81 Physical function clearly influences health outcomes and gives the provider important information about a patient's current health status.11, 30, 77, 83-89 Routine, standa rdized assessments of physical function can aid providers in recognizi ng declining health and ite ms such as ability to climb stairs or walk are relevant for discha rge planning and needs a ssessment to minimize resulting disability and handicap. Some measures are based on patient self-report80, 90,91 and others are based on provider tests and observations.92-96 The choice of self-report vs. provider- tested function should be considered in the cont ext of the purpose of th e measure: Self report captures the patient's view of his/her abilities, which is critical for care transitions and to examine outcomes over episodes of care; wherea s providers may wish to record observed physical functions for care planning and monitoring. Table 3.1 gives two examples of item sets that emphasize physical function. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and basic activities of daily living (ADLs)97-100 are a mainstay of geriatric asse ssment and serve to describe an individual's ability to accomplish tasks needed for self-maintenance and independence in the community.101 The ADL scales typically include items such as bathing, dressi ng, toileting, eating, tran sferring and continence. Several scales include ability to walk across a ro om with or without an assistive device. The Katz ADL, Barthel Index, and F unctional Independence Measures were all created as observer reported ADL scales. In common practice, the Ka tz ADL items and Barthel Index are used as self or proxy reported items. IADLs/ADLs can be queried with different response scales \"have underlying physic al and cognitive limitations.102-104 ADLs have been noted to have a hierarchical relationship for loss.103, 105, 106 This hierarchical structur e can be useful as providers review patient status. IADLs do not c onsistently demonstrate this property.99, 105 Because of their focus on an individual's abil ity to function independently in the community, IADLs/ADLs are important quality of care outcome s. In addition, IADL/ADL difficulty and requiring or receiving help are r ecognized and robust predictors of mortality, hospitalization, and nursing home use.11, 17, 24, 105, 107-111 IADL disability also pred icts outpatient and home care resource use. A common concern with ADL items is whether they are sufficiently sensitive to clinical improvement and change. However, the longer Functional Independence Measure (FIM), with its 7-point response scale, has shown more sensitivity to change.

The times to complete the first meter and the entire path were recorded. The test was repeated three times, twice at the woman's usual pace and once at her fastest possible pace. The speed of the faster of the two usual-pace walks is pres ented. The length of the walk expressed in meters divided by the time in seconds was used to calcul ate average walking speed.\" Chair Stand \"participants were asked to sit with their arms folded across their chests in a straight-backed chair placed with its back against a wall, and then to stand up from the chair one time.

Timing commenced from the initial sitting position and ended at the final standing pos ition at the end of the fifth stand.\" Standing Balance \"Static balance is evaluated in three different, progressively more difficult stances...: (1) side-by-side: feet side by side, touching; (2) semi-tandem: side of the heel of one foot touching the big toe of the other; (3) tandem: heel of one foot directly in front of and touching the toes of the other foot. Each stance is progressively more difficult to hold. Women unable to hold a position for 10 seconds were not asked to attempt further stands.\" ___________________________ a Note, this later item is typically consider ed an ADL, however, it is included here as part of the SF-36 physical function scale . Table 3.2 summarizes the activit ies included in two common ADL assessment tools. Many consider the Katz scale as the most fundamental set. The Barthel Index uses a different response metric for various items and adds two mobility items, increasing the assessment range of the index.

Domain Group III: Health Behaviors and Preferences Tobacco use strongly influences health and the ability to recover from injury or illness.17, 34 Screening for tobacco use and providing guidance and assistance with cessation are considered quality care processes.79, 112 Knowledge of a pati ent's level of alcohol use is important and improves quality79 because of the potential interacti on of alcohol with many medications.113 The Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 44 number of drinks a week can be directly queried. In addition, excessive alcohol use can be an important influence on overall health, safety, and adherence to medications.114 Screening tools such as the Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener (CAGE), Alcohol-Use Identification Test (AUDIT), and the Alcohol-Relat ed Problems Survey (ARPS)115 have been used to identify problem drinking in older adults. The role of physical activity and diet in patient prognosis and improvement are clearly recognized,116 and screening is considered important for high quality care.79 In addition to IADL items addressing ability to prepare meals and m obility items discussed under functional status above, food access may be relevant for discharge pl anning. Likewise, dietary needs and allergies related to conditions below would be of importance. Patient autonomy and control over health decisions is a recogni zed care value. Advance care plans and goals of care seek to formally document patient preferences for future interventions in the event the patient becomes unable to express preferences. Despite the seeming wisdom of such planning, providers infreque ntly devote resources to assisti ng patients with this process. Simple queries, whether part of a study intervention or mandated data collection, do not appear to improve the quality or frequency of completion of advance care directives.117 It is important, however, to standardize transmission across care sites of those preferen ces that have been expressed and documented. The POLST, a one-page form, includes current treatment restrictions, treatment re strictions for future states, and d ecision-making. It has had overall success in one region for conveying advance ca re information about nursing home residents across providers.118-122 4. Domain Group IV: Diagnoses, Conditions and Associated Treatments Active diagnoses requiring care management and follow-up are clearly important for discharge planning and care transitions. Medical dia gnoses and conditions are recognized factors influencing death, hospitalization, functional impr ovement, and functional decline. The common medical diagnoses and conditions that are im portant for improving outcomes and discharge planning are dementia,12, 15, 123-126 diabetes,8, 127, 128 stroke,19, 23, 127-129 mood disorder and other psychiatric diagnosis,20, 130, 131 myocardial infarction or angina,19, 132, 133 valvular heart disease,17, 134 heart failure,17, 135 other heart conditions,23 limited vision,23, 128 limited hearing,23, 136 limited vision or hearing,26, 133 hip fracture,137 cancer,22, 138 falls,139, 140 and arthritis.21, 127 While these are the most commonly named significant risk factors fo r decline or future utilization, multiple other diagnoses and conditions may be important for a given patient. These diagnoses and conditions would vary by individual and could include, but not be lim ited to, the list provided above. Medications used to treat disease are a marker for active diagnoses, diseas e severity and health status.141 Medication errors continue to be a common source of medical error. Such errors can stem from drug-to-drug interactions, from drug- disease interactions or from potential over- and under-utilization of certain classes of drugs.142 Clear and accurate tr ansmission of reconciled medication lists (admission and disc harge lists with name, indicati on, dose; allergies) is central to safe care transitions. The Me dicare Modernization Act offers an opportunity to systematically collect medication information and could be a powerful supplement to assessment data and quality improvement activities.143, 144 Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 45 Administrative data are frequently used to identify diagnoses and conditions. These data typically have better specificity than se nsitivity for capturing medical diagnoses and conditions.145-148 A few exceptions are notable. Outpatient diagnoses may be assigned to justify diagnostic testing for some conditions leading to a decrease in specificity of administrative data used for filing claims.149, 150 In addition, long-standing problem lists may lack specificity for detecting active disease and should be dis tinguished from other administrative data. a. Under-detected Conditions and Syndromes W ith Potential Importance for Standardized Assessment Tools : Although administrative data have acceptable sensitivity for noting many conditions, under-detection is a significant problem for several important conditions and geriatric syndromes151, 152 such as dementia,153, 154 depression,155-157 pain,158-160 delirium,161 and falls.162 Medical record data and administrative data frequently demonstrate poor sensitivity for identifying these conditions because providers fail to systematically assess for their presence. This has important quality of care implicati ons because these under-d etected conditions are critical to the quality manageme nt of vulnerable older adults,79, 163 may be caused by drug side effects or interactions,164 are important for discharge pla nning and improving care transitions,165 and are the conditions most lik ely to evidence quality defi ciencies in care processes.166 In addition, with the exception of falls, these conditi ons and syndromes have each been associated with variations in how patients report on preferences, other symp toms, and conditions. As such, measurement is particularly important if a disc harge assessment tool will contain patient self- report items. The following paragraphs discu ss some approaches to screening for these conditions. b. Depression : Several depression screeni ng tools have been tested and found to be valid. Most instruments screen for symptoms of possible depression. Because some symptoms such as disturbed sleep may reflect diseases other than depression, final diagnosis requires additional clinical identification that the symptoms relate to depression and that DS M-IV depression criteria are met. Some of the more commonly used self-report depression scr eeners are the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS);167, 168 the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES- D);169 the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (Prime MD);170, 171 the PRIME-MD 2- item;172 and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).131, 173-175 The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) and the Ham ilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) are among the more commonly used interviewer or observe r rated tools for use in severely cognitively impaired or non-communicative patients. Both the CSDD and the Ham-D require considerable evaluator training to achieve acceptable reliability.176, 177 The CES-D and GDS are the more long-standing t ools and represent a signi ficant advance from older surveys that asked for soma tic symptoms such as palpitati ons. The CES-D consists of 20 items, has acceptable psychometric properties in a dults, but has had limited acceptability to providers. The GDS was developed specificall y for older adults and also has acceptable psychometric properties, but has not been widely adopted outside of th e Geriatrics community. Thirty-, fifteen-, twelve-, and five-item available. The 15-item GDS shows almost equivalent sensitiv ity and specificity to the longer 30 item version. One study that compared the CES-D to the GDS in 130 commu nity-dwelling adults age 60 or older found comparable performance. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.92 and 0.81 for the GDS-15 and 0.92 and 0.87 for the CES-D. 178 Specificity is typically signif icantly lower in sicker populations. In a nursing home sample that was limited to persons with mild or no cognitive impairment, Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 46 comparable sensitivity and specificity were 0.88 and 0.62 for GDS-15 and 0.74 The PRIME-MD, PRIME-MD 2-item, and PHQ-9 are a related group of depression screening tools. The PRIME-MD is the longest. It is a 27-item questionnaire with follow-up clinical interview. The PRIME-MD is c onsidered a gold standard diagnosti c tool, but its length prevents widespread implementation as a sc reening tool. The shortest is the PRIME-MD 2-item. Its two items have a high sensitivity (0.96) but a low sp ecificity (0.57) for detecting depression. The developers acknowledge that this level of specificity means that at least 35 out of 100 persons screened would have a false positive result. This would seem to be too high for a publicly mandated assessment tool. The PHQ-9 is a se lf-report version of th e PRIME-MD with a reported sensitivity of 0.88 and specificity of 0.88. Its items directly rela te to DSM-IV criteria for diagnosing depression. The PHQ-9 is increa singly being used across health care settings,180, 181 and has been shown to be sensitive to change.173 It has been used effectively in practice- based interventions to improve primar y care of depression in older adults.175, 182-184 In addition to the PRIME-MD 2- item, other one- and two-item sc reeners have been explored. One study found that the Yale Depression singl e-item screen \"Do you often feel sad or depressed\" had comparable sensitivity and specificity to the GDS (0.69 and 0.90 for Yale Depression; 0.54 and 0.93 for the GDS)185 but some have suggeste d that these single-item approaches may not perform as well in older populations.186 Moreover, these abbreviated items would be unlikely to show sensitivity to change and therefore might fail to meet the important need for serial assessments to monitor response to therapy. 187 Table 3.3 describes selected self- report depression screening instruments.

Do you fell pretty worthless the way you are now? 13. Do you feel full of energy? 14. Do you feel that your situation is hopeless? 15. Do you think that most people are better off than you? c. Pain : Pain is a prevalent condition in older ad ults. For patients with pain, appropriate assessment and tracking of pain is an important element of care.79, 188 It is also an important quality of life outcome and relates to other outcomes.140 Because of the need to track pain symptoms, treatment response, and the need to determine if pain is new or worsening, a standardized measure should be considered for inclusion in information conveyed at care transitions. As an indicator of the importanc e of serial assessment, standardized pain measurement is sometimes referred to as the \"fifth vital sign.\" 189-191 Several different generic (i.e., not condition-specific) pain scales have been developed and used across care settings. The most commonly used pain intensity scales are the 0 to10 Numeric Rating Scale (11-point NRS) and Verbal Descriptor Scales (VDSs). The 11-point NRS is commonly used in hospital settings. It can be administered verbally, aski ng the patient to rate pa in with 0 indicating \"no pain\" and 10 indicating \"worst pain can imagine.\" The preferred mode of administration in older adults or populations with mixed communicatio n abilities is face-to- face with both verbal questioning and visual display of th e NRS scale in large print. An example of a NRS is shown in Figure 3.1. Other NRS number lines might show only the bottom and top anchor. Verbal descriptor scales offer a variet y of response metrics. A common VDS is the one included in the McGill Short Form questionnaire and is listed in Figure 3.1. A differe nt VDS commonly used independently in the literature is also shown. Other tools, such as the faces rating scale, may have poorer performance in population sub-groups such as cognitively impaired.188, 192 Longer pain multi-dimensional assessment tools al so consider frequency of pain, location of pain, and effect on function. The original McGill Pain Questionnaire is a standard in the field, using body maps to identify pain location, word gr oupings to describe pain, and items for rating pain. It also includes items on history, medications, etc. The aut hors report that it takes 15-20 minutes to initially complete and the time decr eases to 10 minutes or less with interviewer experience.193 Shorter forms of the McGill have been proposed but these remain time consuming. The Geriatric Pain Measure is a shorter multidimensional pain assessment designed Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 48 to evaluate older adults. It has been shown to have converg ent validity with the McGill (pearson's r = .63, p < .0000). It includes 24 items that address pain in tensity, disengagement, pain with walking, and pain with activities.194 Figure 3.1: Examples of Nu meric Rating Scales and Verbal Descriptor Scales Numeric Rating Scale (NRS): \"On a scale of zero to ten, where zer o means no pain and ten equals the worst possible pain, what is your current pain level?\" Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Verbal Descriptor Scales (VDS)-- two examples: McGill VDS Rate the overall intensity of your pain Other commonly used VDS Have you had pain over the past two weeks?

Mild 2. Moderate 3. Severe 4. Very severe, horrible d. Cognitive Impairment : Cognitive impairment influences discharge location195 and rehabilitation outcomes196 and is important for discharge plan ning and safety issues during care transitions. Some quality indica tor sets advocate documentation of cognitive status on admission to the hospital or a new physician practice.79 The US Preventive Task Force, however, has failed to find sufficient evidence to support routine screening.112 Multiple tools have been developed to aid in cognitive screening and assessment. The most commonly used and accepted cognitive assessment is the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE). 197 Its 20 items assess orientation, memory (recall), calculation/task memory, language, and vis uospatial skill. It must be administered face- to face and requires approximately 10 minutes to complete. For those providers who do screen for cognitive impairment, the MMSE has gained wide clinical acceptance. It correlates well with more in-depth gold standard neurocognitive testing by trained clinicians, although some cognitive domains are not assessed by the MMSE. It may be most lacking in its ability to identify early cognitive impairment and early loss of executive func tion, even after using accepted norms to adjust for education and ag e. Nonetheless, the MMSE has become the standard assessment against which shorter assessments are typically compared. Clock drawing has been proposed as a simple sc reen for early cognitive impairment or loss of executive function that may be missed by the MMSE. 198 It must also be administered face-to- Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 49 face. The Clock draw test may have some valu e as an independent screen for care planning because it may identify persons at risk for future institutionalization.199 However, it may not have equal validity in different cultural groups200 and even when coupled with MMSE is not sufficient for screening for all cogni tively-related safety concerns.201 The Mini-Cog combines 3-item recall with the clock draw.202 A score of 0-2 suggests dementia. When \"na\u00efve\" interviewers use the Mini-C og, their performance has been found to be comparable to trained interviewers.203 Sensitivity and specificity for classifying as \"some\" versus \"no\" impairment was similar to the MMS E in one community based sample, sensitivity = 76% vs. 79%, and specificity = 89% vs. 88% for dementia.204 Researchers have developed abbrev iated tools that can be administ ered by telephone. One such tool uses 3-item recall (apple, table, penny) and 3-item temporal orientation (day week, month, year) items to screen for cognitive impairment. Greater than 3 errors has sensitivity (89%) and specificity (88%) for classifying as dementia.205 Other cognitive screen ing tools that can be administered by telephone include the 7-item Bl essed Orientation Memory Concentration Test (BOMC)206 and the 10-item Short Portable Me ntal Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ).207 For these shorter instruments, brevity and ease of admini stration come at the expense of floor and ceiling effects and ability to identify executive dysf unction. The Callahan and BOMC tools offer limited ability to measure change over time. The SPMSQ does allow some differentiation of levels of impairment. The Telephone Intervie w for Cognitive Status (TICS), has been more recently created for telephone screening for rese arch purposes. It has a proxy version and does allow differentiation of levels of impairment. It requires about the same amount of time to complete as the MMSE, and may have fewer ceiling effects.208 However one recent, small study suggests low sensitivity (0.38) for detecti ng age associated memory impairment.209 e. Delirium : Delirium is another under-detected health condition that is associated with poor health outcomes across settings,210-213 is a marker of hospital quality,214 and is important to detect in order to improve care transiti ons. It is associated with si gnificant increase in current and future healthcare utilization.215, 216 Detection is complicated by th e fact that delirium may be superimposed on dementia or may occur in persons with no prior history of cognitive impairment. The Confusi on Assessment Method (CAM) 217 is an accepted gold standard screening tool for delirium. It is completed after conducting a stru ctured cognitive exam such as the MMSE, and requires significant staff trai ning to achieve acceptable sensitivity or reliability.218 f. Falls : A history of falling is related to important patient outcomes including future falls, hip fracture, recovery, mortality, and self-imposed limitation in mobility because of a fear of falling.128, 140, 219-223 Discharge planning might be improved by identifying those patients with fall history.139 This can be accomplished by a simple query regarding number of falls in past year, classifying responses as 0,1, >1. In addition, it is important to note that some persons who limit their activity because of fear of falling do not have a prior history of falls.224 However, measuring fear of falling may require a more complex set of items.225 Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 50 C. CHALLENGES FOR MEASURING DOMAINS The preceding discussion presents domains with strong support for inclusion in standardized assessments. There is less consensus regarding th eir priority for inclusion or the best specific items for measuring these domains across population groups and across care settings. Unfortunately, the evidence base for identifying \"best items\" varies widely in sampling, the number and combination of considered domains and items, and the approach to querying those important patient domains and outomes.226, 227 This variation yields many apparently contradictory findings.228 Unfortunately, very few studies have been conducted in older adults to directly compare the performance of different as sessment instruments or the best combination for covering the full range within domains. As indicated by the date range of the references above, most of these domains have been recognized and confirmed as impor tant predictors for many years. The current challenge is selecting from among the potentially relevant do mains those that are most appropriate for the purposes of this assessment, and then identifying the best ways to measure each domain to meet these needs. Once a domain is targ eted, a further challenge arises from the need to include items and scales that are relevant for the entire Medicare PAC popula tion. Covering the full range within a domain to avoid floor and ceiling eff ects can be extremely burdensome. Approaches such as those presented in Chapter 5 offer pr omise for minimizing burden while assuring precise measurement across the population. Developmental work might requir e the collection of data to allow better comparisons of performance in di verse populations of olde r adults in order to address the potential challenges to item validity and relevance outlined below. The potential challenges to validity and feas ibility of the assessment include achieving agreement across assessors in actual care settings, identifying how items will be collected, minimizing burden, achieving acceptability to pr oviders and patients, accounting for item performance across population subgroups, accounting for the effect of variations in item wording on the relationship of items to each other and to th e underlying construct, and translation of data into improved care. Each of these is discussed briefly below. 1. Agreement Across Assessors (inter-rater reliability) Reliable information and reporting are fundamental to achieving assessment validity. Reliability and validity must be considered in the c ontext of both efficacy (performance in ideal circumstances), and effectiveness (performance in actual conditions). 229 Ideal or research collection of items may differ fr om collection in the real worl d because research teams are typically well trained for and charged with focu sing on a limited set of measurement tasks. On the other hand, modern practice time pressures may limit provide r attention to assessment, particularly if a significant amount of training or clini cal evaluation time is needed. This makes it difficult to achieve reliability when collec ting a large number of items in active clinical settings. In addition, users may lack motivati on to invest in accurately assessing mandated items, particularly if they do not perceive a di rect benefit. For these reasons, reliability performance should be tested unde r real-life conditions with the same conditions, providers, and levels of training as would be expected when the s cale or item is in actual use. This has been conducted only for a limited number of the scales or items discussed above and has very rarely been tested for combined assessment tools. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 51 A particularly relevant concern for implemen ting a common assessment tool is the need to achieve reliability across care settings. Differe nt health settings na turally vary in their approaches to patients and care. Providers in di fferent settings may have different levels of training, different experience, a nd a different framework for vi ewing patients. Many of the provider-tested measures of physical function would require significant training to achieve agreement,230 particularly if the type of provider performing the assessment will vary across settings. Even short interview it ems can be strongly influenced by the interviewer's approach to the patient.231 To some extent, having items collected at the hospital prior to discharge may decrease some of the variation th at would be expected across settings and increase the chance for a more common assessment approach. This provides a strong argument in support of the current effort to implement a common assessment prior to hos pital discharge. Even in a single setting, it remains important to ascertain whether the type of clinician collecting the data matters, and if so, specify who should provide which elements. 2. How Items will be Collected (Modes of Administration) In a related issue for evaluating older adults, vari ations in mode of admi nistration present another important factor that must be c onsidered in efforts to develop a care transition assessment. Mode of administration (patient, provi der, or proxy response) is a si gnificant source of variation for interview items, even within a given setting. Care ful attention will need to be paid to determine the best information source for a given item becau se different sources (patient interview, proxy interview, provider interview or observa tion, medical record) do not always agree. 157, 232-247 Whether a patient's or a provider's views are prefe rred is important to consider when determining whether an item should be patient vs. provider re sponse. In addition, research comparisons have even shown significant differences for the same items between self-administered and interviewer-administered questionnaires.248 An algorithm identifying a priority order for information source may be necessary for some items when a primary source is not available. For example, a non-communicative patient may not be able to answer depression items, requiring other approaches for assessment. 3. Burden While each of the above domains is indivi dually important for improving outcomes, care transitions and care planning, it is necessary to consider multip le domains in order to fully capture a patient's health state.85, 249 This is particularly chal lenging when assessing vulnerable older adults with multiple conditions and syndromes.250, 251 In addition, the number of items that are proposed to measure some domains can be si gnificant. For example, most IADL/ADL lists used in surveys contain 10-15 items, and many item responses require follow-up questions (e.g., identifying task modification, identifying need for human assistance). Thus, a full set of IADL/ADL items can be cumbersome to incor porate in surveys and could pose significant provider and respondent burden. Fu rther adding to potential burde n, many items and scales are subject to floor and ceiling effects. The potenti al for these effects can be somewhat minimized in more homogeneous groups such as long-stay nursing home residents. However, for more diverse populations or for assessing across popu lation subgroups with potentially wide ranging health states, this can present a significant but not insurmountable ch allenge to achieving parsimony. Providers are less likely to see an item as burdensome if they see relevance and utility for care proce sses that they value. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 52 Different data sources offer diffe rent advantages and disadvantag es for balancing reduced burden against relevance and accuracy. These considerations will vary across domains and items. This is a particularly important issue for follow- up and post-discharge assessments. Collecting information from pre-existing administrative data might decrease provider and respondent burden. However, administrative data vary in quality and content acro ss organizations, and has well recognized limitations for m onitoring or assessing populations. 252-254 As noted above, many important conditions in this population are under -recognized and underrepor ted, particularly in administrative data. For other items, such as et hnicity and race, administrative data vary in accuracy for particular racial groups, being pl agued by frequent missing data and being more accurate for white and African American than for other groups.255-261 Most importantly, administrative data do not capture functional status. A simple telephone survey or questionnaire c ould make the assessment transportable across settings and organizations and potentially more representative of a patient's real health.262 However, surveys can be time-consuming to ad minister and may be plagued by non-response. Not all domains have identified items that ha ve been collected by telephone interviews. 263 Cognitive impairment presents a particular meas urement challenge for some members of this population. Most research shows th at even persons with moderate cognitive impairment are able to self-report symptoms of depression and pain264-270 as well as answer multidimensional assessments,271 although this finding is not consistent across all item sets or across all studies.268, 269, 272, 273 Other approaches are clearly need ed for assessing persons who are non- communicative or with severe cognitive impair ment. Despite this challenge, it remains important to assess symptoms in persons with co gnitive impairment as they appear to be at increased risk for under-treatment.274, 275 4. Acceptability Provider acceptance is important for encouragin g accurate assessment and for incorporation of assessment findings into better care.276 In addition to time and da ta collection burden discussed above, the subject matter of a particular item may limit acceptab ility. This appears to be particularly relevant for many of the SES variables. Providers express ethi cal concerns about considering race in clinical care,73, 277 and correctly point to geneti c heterogeneity that exists within socially constructed racial categories.73 Many patients feel unc omfortable with being asked about race, ethnicity, or SES, although this might be mitigated if they understand that the query is meant to ensure equal quality.278 Many SES variables present unique challenges for self-report and administrative data with potentially complex interactions and variations in conclusions depending on definitions applied. 279 Although less dramatic, other items may not be asked because of limited acceptability. Despite th e widespread use of the GDS to screen for depression in research studies and geriatric trai ning programs, it has not b een incorporated into standard care, with some providers objecti ng to routine screening terminology such as \"worthless.\" For both GDS and other tools wi th scales, providers may fail to understand the need to ask and respondents may resist answer ing several items that seem redundant, merely because they load onto a comm on factor and permit scaling. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 53 5. Item Wording and Application to Subsets of the Population In describing the domains above, we noted th at some, such as gender, race, language, and cognitive status are associated wi th variations in proclivity to report and in ability to respond to items. In addition, for these gr oups, individual item responses for subgroups of respondents may vary in terms of how they rela te to the underlying construct be ing measured. Analytic methods are available to assess and address this problem if the same set of items has been collected in the relevant subgroups. For example, concerns have been raised that the se lf-reported difficulty of IADL/ADL items may vary by gender because of traditional differences in role-function, 99, 280, 281 and the hierarchical order of IADL items ha s been shown to vary between age subgroups.105 Item response theory (IRT) methods have been used to show that the relationship of these items to the construct of disability do not vary for women compared to men or for oldest old compared to younger old. 282 Systematic cross-cultural testing is lacking for many items that may be subject to cultural variati ons in performance.99, 283 If data on items were available in sufficiently large and diverse samples, similar approaches could be used to examine other items across relevant population subgroups. Specific item wording is important in the pe rformance of a domain across population subgroups and overtime.105, 228 The prevalence of self-reported difficulty and self-reported need-for-help varies by age,227 and item wording changes the relati onships of the items to the underlying construct of disability.282 For example, the response categories used to assess IADL/ADL limitations can include difficulty vs . no difficulty, able vs. not able , receive-help vs. not receive- help, and does vs. does not do. Difficulty is not a simple mid-point va lue on a scale extending from no difficulty to receive-help.226 The choice of item wording and response categories can lead to different prevalence and outcome estimat es across studies and in the same population. 104, 284 226, 284-286 In addition, individual I ADL/ADL items differ in the extent to which they vary across response categories.104, 227 These variations affect the interpretation of IADL/ADL items and can make comparison of ordered lists difficult. Item wording also circumscribes the conclusions that can be drawn from a given item. For example, the MCBS asks if the respondent recei ved help, not if the res pondent needed help. This may lead to differential identification of IADL/ADL probl ems across groups with different access to resources. For example, assistive device s can avert the need for assistance and unmet need for these devices may hasten dependency. In one study of a de mentia population, persons with baseline unmet need were more likely to be placed in nursing homes, die or be lost to follow-up, even after considering IADL/ADL and cognitive status.287 Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it is not clear whether any type of assessment, in the absence of other systematic quality improvement activities, will improve outcomes.288 It is increasingly recognized that asse ssing and noting these factors is a necessary but not sufficient condition for improving care and care outcomes. Indeed, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening adults for depression if the clinical practice has systems in place to assure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow-up.112 In one research study, a comprehensive assessment initiated in the hos pital and followed up for completion at home identified problems and led to some changes in therapy;289 however, the effect was limited and six-month outcomes were not improved.290 Coupling assessment with management can make a difference. In a controlled trial of Geriatri c Evaluation and Management (GEM) Units that Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 54 combined assessment with clinical management, patients cared for in inpatient GEM units had less functional decline at 6 mont hs than those receiving standard care, and patients in outpatient GEM care had better mental health outcomes.291 D. EXAMPLES OF AVAILABLE INSTRUMENTS AND SURVEYS FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING POPULATIONS 1. Health Outcomes Survey (Medicare HOS, fo rmerly known as the Health of Seniors Survey) The HOS is part of the Health Employer Data Set (HEDIS\u00ae) collection of measures published by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NC QA). Plans collect this data as part of NCQA accreditation (if sought). The 90-item HOS includes 3 components: the SF-36, items for case-mix risk adjustment, and items added by CMS for monitoring Me dicare Managed Care Plans. Both a baseline random sample of 1,000 Medicare Beneficiarie s in each plan (if enrollment population <1000, then all beneficiarie s are surveyed) and two- year follow-up survey are obtained. Since 1997, CMS has required all Medicare Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) to collect and report HEDIS\u00ae measures and MCOs have submitted HOS to CMS since 1998.292 The HOS is derivative of SF-36, a core set of 36 items.88, 90, 293, 294 A slightly different scoring system has been put forth for the proprietary MOS SF-36 \u00ae (International Resource Center for Health Care Assessment, Boston MA) and the pu blicly available RAND 36-item Health Survey 1.0. Two point changes on the overall score have b een associated with clinically meaningful changes in status. The SF-36 includes eight scales that measure the following domains: physical function (10 items); physical role limitations (4 items); emo tional role limitation (3 items), social role limitation (2 items); emotional well-being (5 items); pain (2 items); energy or fatigue (4 items); general health perceptions (5 items). It has repeatedly be en shown to evidence strong psychometric properties. The inte rnal reliability of the scales has been reported as: physical function (0.93); physical role limitations (0.84); emotional role limitation (0.83), social role limitation (0.85); emotional well-being (0.90); pa in (0.82), energy or fatigue (0.87), general health perceptions (0.78). Two component scores can also be generate d: a physical component and a mental component. The SF-36 has been repeatedly shown to be a valid measure of health status in a wide range of patient populations,88, 295-302 has been used as a gold-standard outcome measure in multiple studies, has shown sensitivity to change, and ha s shown convergent validity with differences in care quality and other health i ndexes or physiologic measures, in cluding studies in vulnerable and frail populations.291, 303-314 The MHI-5 has shown validity wh en compared to gold-standard measures for identifying major depression in f unctionally impaired elde rs (sensitivity = 78.7% and specificity = 72.1%),315 and the mental health subscale is highly correlated wi th the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) in nursing home residents capable of self-report.316 Some scales such as role-emotion showed less convergent validity in nursing home populations.316 It has also been applied as a validation gold standard in multiple studies developing new health status and quality of life measure.317-320 The SF-36 has been tested in persons with mild to moderate cognitive impairment and shown to have continued acceptable psychometric properties.271 Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 55 The HOS is designed to be a self-administered, mailed survey. The SF-36 and HOS can also be interviewer administered. A Spanish language vers ion of the HOS is available. The SF-36 has been translated and validated in multiple languages.321-330 The SF-36 may not capture all relevant components of quality of life fo r all patient subgroups.331- 334 It has been criticized as more relevant to younger populations and su bject to floor effects.335- 337 One study of the SF-36 (without ADL/IADL items) in an acute stroke population found internal consistency of the scales and sensitivit y to change over time, but poor correlation with accepted measures of stroke severity.338 Likewise, abbreviated versions of the SF-36, such as the SF-20, have been more subject to floor e ffects in more severely ill populations.315, 326 However, the HOS added more ADL items, and some analyses in more vulnerable el ders reveal continued validity of scales.339 A modified version of the SF-36 that expands dichotomous response options has been developed for veteran populations with a resulting reducti on in ceiling and floor effects for the expanded item responses.340 2. Continuity of Care Record (CCR) The Continuity of Care Record (CCR) aims to provide a structure and standard to facilitate documentation and transfer of health information acr oss providers and settings . It is intended as a longitudinal snapshot of patient data. The structure aims to accommodate multiple clinical domains with required sections addressing condi tions (active, resolve d, admission and discharge diagnoses), allergies (pharmac y, dietary, general), and medications (history, administered, discharge, current). Optional sections allow cap ture of advance direct ives, functional status, procedures, encounters, family hi story, social history, immunizati ons, vital signs, lab results and plan of care. In order to enha nce interoperability, the CCR does not allow individual users of the standard to add additional sections. The CCR st andard process is set up to allow additional sections to be added through a formal ballot process. There are two sets of constraints or rules on the standard. The CCR intends to apply HL-7 messaging standards and if used in an electr onic format requires adhe rence to XML schema, which says what names tags must have and in whic h order. It also defi nes what is optional and what is required. Work is underway to deve lop a HL7 CDA implementation guide for the CCR, which would easily allow HL7 V3 messaging. Th e second set of constraints comes from the implementation guide. It contains the constraints that are not ea sily definable in a XML schema, such as which controlled vocabulary to use. The CCR intends to have the ability to capture coded data such as type of clinical documen t/encounter, conditions, allergies, laboratory, vital signs, radiology procedures, operati ve procedures, other procedures such as LP, aspiration - in LOINC or any other controlled vocabulary. CCR w ill allow for the coding of a particular data element in multiple controlled vocabularies. For example, the problem list could be coded through a controlled vocabulary su ch as ICD9, SNOMED, or ICPC. The final specification will also be influenced by current efforts to estab lish which controlled vocabularies can quickly be absorbed by users and software developers and by current efforts to work with controlled vocabulary developers to achieve complete coverage of the con cepts that might be captured by the CCR. CCR does not specify a particular standardized it em, scale or question wording, aiming instead to identify controlled vocabulary that would allow capture and summary of medical record Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 56 content in a uniform presentation. Enumerations of items were part of the early development of the standard, but the consensus process required that they be removed. Work is ongoing to identify or develop standardized, controlled voca bularies for several of th e optional sections such as advance directives, functional status, fa mily history, and soci al history. The CCR Acceleration Task Force is also looking at enumer ations for concepts such as <Status>, which are not covered by a controlled vocabulary. So me of the vendors in the CCR Acceleration Task Force have taken the initial enumer ation work and have worked to re fine it for their needs. The need for these enumerations is due to the fact that some domains within the CCR are not covered by current \"free\" controlled vocabularies (or any controlled vocabular y). CCR Acceleration Task Force Leaders have noted that no demogr aphic elements have been specified in the standard. There is no consensus as to which medication controlled vocabulary should be used. The two most widely available, NDC and RxNorm, have recognized but differe nt limitations. Some believe that NDC is not modeled in a way that facilitates physician use or decision support. RxNorm may be modeled in a more accessible way, but is not complete. The CCR has not been implemented. The generation of a longitudinal health summary that relies on controlled vocabularies and can enhance info rmation exchange in an EHR holds great promise for improving care transfers. However, a lack of standardized survey or assessment items raises questions about the ability of a tool such as a CCR to track quality issues or outcomes across providers and patients. One could imagine that some process measures based on appropriate medications for di agnoses could be generated. 3. VA GEC Referral Form This assessment form was adapted from the Mi chigan Choice Instrument which includes items related the MDS-HC. Its primary purpose is to improve care planni ng at discharge, including the identification of the appropriate level of care and support needs. It includes 91 questions across the following 22 sections: (1) referral source ; (2) patient's living situation; (3) caregiver characteristics (contact informati on, relationship to the patient, type of support, acces s, ability to increase help); (4) language; (5) homebound status; (6) IADL s (meal preparation, housework, shopping, transportation, telephone use, medication management, managing finances), and recent change in IADL; (7) services in the home; (8) ot her (recent change in living arrangements, want other living situation; amount of physical activity, left alone, su rrogate decision maker, advance directive); (9) skilled care and treatments (DME , special diets, tube feeding, IV, catheter, dialysis, wound care, pressure ulcer care a nd stage, frequency of nurse observation, rehabilitation, substance abuse treatment); (10) ADLs (bathing, dressing, eating, using the toilet; moving in bed, transfers, moving around indoors, mobility with wheelchair) and recent change in ADLs; (11) continence (urine, stool); (12) sk in; (13) behaviors and symptoms (wandering, verbally abusive behaviors, physically abusive be haviors, resisting care , hallucinations); (14) cognitive status (ease of decision making, ab ility to make self understood, agitation or disorientation poses danger); (15) prognosis (rec ent flare, direct care staff perception of possibility for increased independence, limited life expectancy); (16) weight bearing status; (17) diet; (18) equipment needs; (19) supplies needed; (20) goa ls of care (check a ll that apply); (21) program to which referred; and (22) estimated duration of services. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 57 The VA instrument includes many of the domains of interest for the uniform assessment instrument; however, little inform ation is available on the scales that are being proposed in terms of precision at different levels of impairment, reliability, and sensitivity to change. The background materials that support the VA GEC referral form indicate that, in field trials, if \"a provider who knows the patient\" co mpletes the form, the completion time is under 10 minutes. A study is currently underway in the VA to evalua te baseline referral practices prior to full implementation of the VA GEC, whic h is scheduled for early 2006. 4. Core Outcome and Comprehensive Assessment - Basic (COCOA-B) The 174 items in the COCOA-B address multiple domains relevant to patient outcomes, care transitions and resource planning. It serves as a comprehensive health assessment reviewing the domains listed above as well as additional sy mptoms, sensory impairments, prognosis, and nutritional status. Sections a nd items include: demographics & SES (gender, age, Medicaid eligibility, ethnicity, race, mar ital status, primary language and English fluency, education); diagnoses (record up to 8, ICD-9, severity rating 0-4; acute or chronic); overall prognosis and life expectancy; pain (presence, severity, freque ncy, interfere with daily activities, intractable); pressure ulcers (presence, number at each stage, stage of most problematic, status of most problematic); select health behaviors; flu i mmunization status; vision ; hearing; height and weight; hydration (oral fluid intake, skin tugor); risk symptoms (dyspnea, edema); adherence); adherence to therapy/interventions; self-rated health; 9 IADL/ADL items (difficulty, receive help); functional performance (lifting 10 lbs, walk \u00bc mile); attend ance at day health center; type whom the patient lives; caregiver (existen ce, number, advance directives; anxiety, stress/ concerns; 10 symptoms of reported or disturbed mood; frequency of 6 behavior problems; cognitive items (cognitive function, memory, judgment, ability to understand others, ability to express thoughts); sa tisfaction and problems with care and access; social isola tion; self-rated quali ty of life; caregive r stress, coping and satisfaction with services and access; items co mpleted by therapist include patient endurance, ability to perform 8 ADLs (5-point response scale) and 6 IADLs, prognosis for rehab and structural variables. 5. The Vulnerable Elders 13 Item Survey (VES-13) The VES-13 was developed as a parsimonious appro ach to identifying older adults at significant risk for health decline in order to allo w better targeting of evaluations and care. 11, 341 It was developed as part of the Assessing Care of Vuln erable Elders (ACOVE) project. Its 13 items address age, physical function, self -rated health, and IADL/ADLs. It is being used in several health care systems to screen for and identify elders warranting referral for more comprehensive geriatric assessment. It provi des information on a set of elde rs for whom quality of care measurably improves 15-month outcomes.342 The VES-13 is provided as an example of the type of tool that can be developed when common factors and outcomes are available for a group of pa tients. Its development considered a range of domains important for health outcomes in older adults. IRT methods were employed to test the applicability of IADL/ADL ite ms to population subgroups (male, female, oldest-old, younger- Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 58 old) and to test change in performance if res ponse choices were varied. Because it was planned as an easily transportable paper a nd pencil tool, best subset analys es were used to decrease item burden within a domain and regre ssion models were used to elim inate domains from the tool. Finally, an integer-based scori ng approach was developed and tested in order to facilitate provider and patient assessment. It can be self -administered, administered by non-clinical office staff over the phone,166 or in face-to-face interviews in le ss than 5 minutes (average telephone = 2.8 minutes). Its brevity prevents it from capturing all of the fu nctional status items that might be important for a given patient, screening for syndromes such as mood or pain, and from capturing all of the data that would be important for an individual's care transition. Because diagnoses did not add to its targeting ability, they are not incl uded, but are clearly relevant for care transitions. It is subject to ceiling effects in healthy popul ations. However, its physical function and IADL/ADL items are highly correlated with mood, pain and cogni tion; reported problems with VES-13 items are being used to identify those pa tients warranting more detailed queries of these conditions and syndromes. Self-rated health also correlates w ith multiple dimensions of health, including disease diagnoses and function,32, 343 and provides additional inform ation even when these items are considered.51, 344, 345 E. CONCLUSION Several domains are recognized as important for standardized, quali ty assessment of older adults in hospital and community settings. To sele ct items for measuring domains in diverse populations, several challenges will need to be ad dressed. Some instrume nts exist that aim to improve assessment but none seem to offer the brevity, flexibility, adequate testing across provider and population subgroups, a nd a range that avoids ceili ng and floor effects. The VA GEC and COCOA-B assess multiple domains, but feasibility and acceptability for providers remains to be determined. The CCR includes multiple domains, but has not been tested and fails to identify specific item sets for measuring thos e domains. While this achieves the desired flexibility for an electronic health record, it would prohibit comparisons across providers, an important objective for a national data collection effort. For many domains, it would also limit its utility and ease of translation for different pr oviders because they may not be familiar with or understand how to translate particular measures applied by other providers. The SF-36 has the widest experience and offers the advantage of current use as part of HEDIS. Domains like medications that are untappe d by the SF-36 could be added.

Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 86 Chapter 4 Hospital Discharge Assessment and Data Items that Facilitate Appropriate Placement and Efficient Care Transitions A. INTRODUCTION This chapter focuses on two of the three explic it primary purposes for a uniform assessment tool: the facilitation of decision making regarding ap propriate PAC placement and the provision of core patient information to promote safe and efficient care transitions between care settings. The third primary purpose, assessment of outcomes across settings and over time, is addressed in Chapter 6. In conceptualizing the approach to developing a Uniform Pa tient Assessment Instrument (UPAI) that could be used across acute and PAC settin gs, MedPAC recommended that the initial focus should be to develop an instrument that would be completed at the time of discharge from the acute hospital. This assessment would enable pr oviders to adequately initiate PAC in the most appropriate setting and provide a baseline uniform characterizati on of patients for longitudinal monitoring as they transfer between acute and po st-acute care, as well as between different PAC settings. In so doing, this tool would be integral to promoting greater beneficiary-centered care by ensuring smooth transitions among care providers. Ultimately, this assessment instrument will support CMS' vision for a broader model of PAC in which payment, care-planning, quality assurance, and program monitoring are driven according to the individual beneficiary's needs. A more integrated approach to patient assessment will give providers in different settings mo re uniform information about a beneficiary's previous medical and health history to better pl an and manage patient care. However, it is important to recognize that assessme nt in and of itself is not the key to achieving this broader vision. Leaders of this effort need to avoid the pitfall of, \"all assessed up and nowhere to go\". In other words, avoid the scen ario whereby the emphasis is disproportionately placed on assessment rather than initiating the ap propriate actions to improve care. Assessment that does not directly address one of the three primary purposes described above could potentially adversely affect quality if clinicians' attention is distracted away from the essential task of preparing beneficiaries to participate in the care delivered in the next setting. Similarly, if the core information collected and transferred with the beneficiary is inac curate, this approach could adversely affect patient safety by propagating medical erro rs. As with most successful efforts, this broader vision needs to articulate the desired outcome(s) first, and then work backwards to define how assessment can help to produce these outcomes. Equally as important as defining what this assessment instrument would be is to concurrently articulate what this assessment instrument would not be. It would not re place existing setting specific assessment tools such as the MDS, OASI S, or IRF-PAI. It would not comprise a comprehensive data set for care planning. Rather, the assessment instrume nt would contain core data that could be incorporated into setting specific assessm ents and then augmented with additional information pertinent to a given setting. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 87 In approaching the development of a uniform assessment instrument, a few lessons from the literature and a few caveats are worth considerin g. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that hospital discharge pl anning reduces hospital readmission rates, hospital length of stay, hospi tal costs or that it improves health outcomes.1 Similarly, beyond a few select conditions such as st roke and hip fracture, there is a paucity of research to assist clinicians in determining th e optimal discharge destin ation setting for most beneficiaries. Clinicians in most care settings function in silos, operating independently from one another, and consequently ha ve little insight into how care is delivered in other settings.2 The different settings often have different staffing ratios , different orientations and approaches to assessment and management, and face different regulatory and reimbursement requirements. These different requirements also demand differen t data needs, and guidance will be needed for how the proposed uniform assessment instrument tool completed at hos pital discharge would impact the MDS, OASIS, and IRF-PAI. For in stance, the new instrument could either populate or be populated by these setti ng-specific assessment tools. The timing for CMS to develop the uniform assessment instrument is ideal, as this effort will likely result in potential synergies with many existi ng national efforts. As will be discussed later in this chapter, new Joint Commission on Accr editation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) initiatives will focus on continuity and coordina tion out of the hospital. The National Quality Forum has issued a call for performance measures aimed at coordinating care out of the hospital. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement Hospita l is launching a transition out of the hospital initiative as part of its program aimed at Tran sforming Care At the Bedside. With support from the John A. Hartford Foundation, the Society fo r Hospital Medicine (SHM) has undertaken a consensus effort to create a model for Ideal ized Hospital Discharge Planning. The United Hospital Fund is planning a new program aime d at improving communication and collaboration between health care practitioners and family careg ivers at the time of hospital discharge. Finally, the Institute of Medicine's December 2005 re port \"Performance Measurement: Accelerating Improvement\", explicitly addresses tr ansitional care and 3 B. FINDINGS/DISCUSSION 1. Factors Influencing Beneficiar ies' Post-Hospital Destination Before discussing the potential application of a unif orm PAC assessment instrument, it is worth considering the wide and varied factors that have the potential to influence a beneficiary's post- hospital destination. Many key factors may not routinely be captured during assessment. Ideally, the post-hospital destin ation decision should be a join t decision made between the responsible clinicians and the beneficiary, with input from fa mily caregivers. The decision should be based primarily on the beneficiary's care needs at the time of transition and the beneficiary's preferences. The be neficiary should be informed as to what his or her financial obligation would be for the various PAC options under consideration.4 To the extent that family caregivers are expected to assist in the execution of the care plan, their input should be explicitly obtained to determine whether they are willing and able to participate. A host of factors that may not directly concer n the beneficiary's immediate care needs often enter into the decision. Such factors include: service capabili ties and staffing of the receiving Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 88 provider; complexity of patient care and resour ce needs; (s); existing financial discharge planner's familiarity, professional and personal views; time of day, day of week; availability of able and willing car egiver support; patient/family over learning; transportation/geography/weather; and fear of litigation. Some of these factors are within the control of the clinicians handli ng the discharge, while others (e .g., daily per diem rates under the RUGS III system) are not. Currently, there are no evidence-based criteria to inform hospital personnel in determining what the appropriate PAC setting is for a beneficiary with a known set of conditions and skilled care needs. Most of the studies conducted to date ha ve focused on discreet conditions such as stroke and hip fracture. For example, one study by Kramer and colleagues found that since implementation of PPS, beneficiaries are increa singly transferred to IR F with the majority subsequently receiving care in a second Post Acute Care provider.5 Previous work has demonstrated that beneficiaries discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities had improved functional outcomes compared with those discharg ed to SNF. However, this relationship was not observed for beneficiaries who suffered a hip fracture.6 The researchers then used propensity scores to determine the factors that distinguishe d patients transferred to IRF versus SNF. Among numerous characteristics, the factors that di stinguished IRF from SNF patients who suffered a stroke, the main factors were car egiver availability, cognition a nd social/recreational functioning. For patients who suffered a hip fracture, these sa me factors also predicted placement, as did physical function and walking ability. In develo ping guidelines for stroke care, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (now the Ag ency for Healthcare Research and Quality) was unable to reach consensus on th e setting or service needs.7 Thus the evidence needed to guide placement decisions is relatively limited and it is not clear that findings for one condition such as stroke can necessarily be ge neralized to other conditions. 2. Current Regulations That Might Impact a Discharge Planning Tool Prior to the development of a uniform PAC a ssessment instrument, it may be instructive to consider how such a tool might be informed by and aligned with existing regulations. Medicare Conditions of Participation and HIPAA regulations are perhaps mo st relevant to the primary purposes articulated for this assessment instrument. Within Medicare's statutory framework, Conditi ons of Participation explicitly include requirements concerning continuity of care a nd discharge planning for hospitals. JCAHO has deemed status from CMS to provide oversight for these Conditions of Participation. Under statute, this requires JCAHO to assess the care practices delineated in Table 4.1. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 89 Table 4.1: Medicare Conditions of Participatio n Concerning Hospital Discharge Activities Discharge planning: General Requirement The hospital must have in effect a discharge planning process that applies to all patients. The policies and procedures for discharge planning must be specified in writing. Identify Patients At-Risk for Adverse Health Consequences The hospital must identify at an early stage of hospitalizat ion all patients who are likely to suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge if there is no adequate discharge planning. Discharge-Planni ng Evaluation The hospital must provide a discharge-planning evaluation to the patients identified as at-risk and to other patients upon the patient's request or at the request of a physician. Elements of the Discharge-Planning Evaluation The discharge-planning evaluation must include an evaluation of the likelihood of a patient's needing post- hospital services and of the availability of the services. Evaluating the Likelihood of Self-Care The discharge-planning evaluation must include an evaluation of the likelihood of a patient's need for self-care or the possibility of patients being cared for in the environment from which they entered the hospital. Timely Discharge Planning Required The hospital personnel must complete the evaluation on a ti mely basis so that appropri ate arrangements for post- hospital care are made before discharge and to avoid unnecessary delays in discharge. Documentation of Discharge Plan ning and Patient Discussion The hospital must include the discharge planning evaluation in the patient's medical record for use in establishing an appropriate discharge plan and must discuss the results of the evaluation with the patient or individual acting on his or her behalf. Qualified Personnel for Di scharge Plan Development A registered nurse, social worker, or other appropriately qualified personnel must develop, or supervise the development of, a discharge plan if the discharge planning evaluation indicates a need for a discharge plan. Physician Request for Discharge Plan In the absence of a finding by the hospital that a patient needs a discharge plan, the patient's physician may request a discharge plan. In such a case, the hospital must develop a discharge plan for the patient. Hospital to Arrange Services The hospital must arrange for the initial implementation of the patient's discharge plan. Reassessing the Discharge Plan The hospital must reassess the patient's discharge plan if there are factors that may affect continuing care needs or the appropriateness of the discharge plan. Pre-discharge Counseling As needed, the patient and family members or interested persons must be counseled to prepare them for post- hospital care. Transfer and Referral The hospital must transfer or refer pa tients, along with necessa ry medical information, to appropriate facilities, agencies, or outpatient services, as needed, for follow-up or ancillary care. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 90 JCAHO has been criticized for its lack of vigor ous oversight and monitoring of the Medicare hospital Conditions of Pa rticipation in general8 and with respect to the discharge planning process in particular.3;4 In 2002, more than 90% of all hosp itals nationwide received the highest score of 5/5 (i.e., \"substan tial compliance\") for discharg e planning accreditation items.3 These findings are in sharp contrast to the growing evidence base that demonstrates there are serious quality problems in transitional care.9 In its defense, JCAHO has explained that it believed it does not have \"deemed status\" with respect to compliance with discharge planning standards (i.e., that these particular C onditions of Participation had been \"carved out\"). However, subsequent discussions between CMS and JCAHO have clarified that in fact JCAHO does have deemed status for discharge planning standards. Among those Conditions of Participation related to discharge planning identified in Table 4.1, the standard for a Discharge Planning Evaluation is particularly relevant to the development of a uniform PAC assessment instrument. The discha rge-planning evaluation is different from the discharge plan. The evaluation is an assessment that looks at the patien t's physical and mental condition, the likely post-hospital liv ing situation, and the patient' s ability to engage in such daily living activities as eating, dressing, bathing, and ambulating. The plan, including the type of setting to which the patient is to be discharged, focuses on the medical and social support needs of the patient in that setting. CMS' Interpretive Guidelines provide that the ne eds assessment can be formal or informal. The hospital may develop an evaluation tool or prot ocol. Generally, the assessment should include an evaluation of factors that aff ect an individual's needs for care after discharge from the acute care setting, such as an assessment of bio-psyc hosocial needs, the patient's and caregiver's understanding of discharge needs, and identifica tion of post-hospital care resources. At the present time, nonetheless, there is no nationally accepted standa rd for this evaluation. The purpose of a discharge planning eval uation is to determine continui ng care needs af ter the patient leaves the hospital setting. It is not intended to be a care-planning document. Returning to JCAHO, in January 2004, JCAHO im plemented a new approach to the survey process, Tracer Methodology. 10 This new approach also has potential implications for the development of a uniform PAC assessment in strument. Tracer Methodology includes the following elements: (a) following the course of care and services provided to a particular patient; (b) assessing relationships among disciplines and important functions ; (c) evaluating the performance of relevant pro cesses related to patient care ; and (d) identifying potential vulnerabilities in care processes. It is now part of the typical 3-day onsite hospital survey process, and in most instances, a typical team of three surveyors is expected to complete approximately 11 tracers. The Tracer Methodology has not yet been extended beyond the hospital setting but it has potentially important implications for di scharge planning and transitions. In particular, this approach can follow a particular patient, assessing how the patient fares along a continuum of care. It can poten tially assess how well the hospital staff has ascertained post-hospital needs of a particular patient, the pl anning for discharge that has occurred, and, through patient interviews, can assess the patient's understanding about the PAC aspects of his or her care. At the time of this writing, JCAHO plans to extend the Tracer Methodology to include the discharge process from hospital to home. JCAHO surveyors will Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 91 contact beneficiaries several days after discharge to assess whether hospital staff made adequate arrangements and appropriately prep ared beneficiaries for discharge. Another particularly relevant re gulatory concern that may poten tially influence the development of a uniform PAC assessment instrument is the Health Insurance Portab ility and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Exchange of patient s' health information for purpos es of treatment, payment, and health care operations is allowe d under HIPAA. This would include not only the physicians and nursing staff but also case mana gers, home and community services personnel, and the communication of referral information to multiple f acilities just prior to the decision determining appropriate placement. Thus although HIPAA regulat ions are relatively cl ear, misinterpretation is common. Clinicians' may be apprehensive to share information for fear of violating HIPAA laws and facing accompanying penalties. The HIP AA regulations are not the primary barrier per se but rather it is the perceptions, the myths, a nd the false assumption about the regulations. If CMS were to implement a uniform PAC assessment, it would be important to take this opportunity to provide accompa nying language clarifying CMS' in terpretation of HIPAA laws for potential end-adopters. 3. Existing Hospital Discharge Assessment Tools Prior attempts to create a uniform PAC assessmen t instrument can provide important lessons and insights to the current discu ssion. In some cases, the cont ent of the instrument under development provides valuable information into the domains of the new instrument proposed, which are discussed in the following section. Howeve r, in other cases, it is the set of actions or processes that did or did not lead to successful implementation that are particularly instructive. Four instruments will be discussed: the Unif orm Needs Assessment Instrument (UNAI), the Veteran's Association Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) Referral, a pred ictive tool developed by Holland and colleagues, and a prediction tool developed by Fairchild and colleagues. The creation of the UNAI was mandated under OBRA 87. Not unlike the current effort discussed herein, the primary purpose of the UN AI was to determine individual's needs for continuing care and not to replace comprehensive geriatric assessment. 11 The UNAI was intended to improve continuity of care between ac ute, post-acute, and long-term care. It was explicitly designed to help disc harge planners make more inform ed decisions and also transmit essential information to PAC providers to initia te appropriate and timely care. An extensive effort was made to create the UNAI and the domains that were selected are quite similar to those proposed in the next section for the new instru ment. Research Triangle Institute and Meyers Research Institute received the contract to conduct field-testing.12;13 Thus there are many parallels between this past effort and the cu rrent effort under discus sion. According to CMS (HCFA) staff working directly on this instrument in the 1990's, the reasons why the UNAI effort did not go forward were two-fold: (1) there wa s no Congressional mandate for implementation; and (2) the UNAI was not tied to payment. To the extent possibl e, this current effort will be strengthened by directly addressing both of these critical issues that were significant barriers to the success of a similar prior effort. The VA Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) Refe rral Discharge Planning Tool also provides considerable overlap with the current effort towards the creation of a uniform PAC assessment instrument. The VA GEC referral form contains ite ms pertinent to determining the level of care Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 92 required by the patient. It was designed to serve as a single document that could be shared with multiple PAC providers, thereby facilitating a wa y that a common set of information would be available to all programs that might accept the pati ent. The GEC referral form is not intended to be a full assessment; rather, it is a screening tool. The tool was not designed for outcome assessment, so some of the measures such as ADL and IADL are gross scales that do not map onto single metrics and would be unlikely to be sensitive to change. Although it shares many of the domains identified as important for the Medicare assessment instrument, the form deliberately does not include info rmation that can be automatically retrieved from VISTA, the VA's electronic health information system. Such information includes a problem list, medication list, orders, notes, consults, discharg e summary, labs, reports, and vital signs. A 2004 study of interoperable electronic health records for PAC and long-term care settings by Kramer et al. found that a major limitation of the VA's VI STA system is that it does not extend to providers outside of the VA system. 14 This is particularly problematic in relation to medication data, which were at times found to be incomplete, even when the non-VA settings used electronic systems. Because tr ansfer of medication informati on is especially important in facilitating appropriate PAC placement and transitions between PAC settings (see discussion below), the inability to transfer this information across PAC sett ings is of concern. Current testing of the VA GEC referral form is underw ay in the Pacific Northwest and the VA is planning a national rollo ut in early 2006. Holland and colleagues from the Mayo Clinic ha ve developed and validated a screen for specialized discharg e planning services. 15 These services were operationally defined as multifaceted and complex, requiring coordination between hospital and community-based care providers. Of 24 different variab les examined, only four (age, livi ng alone, disabili ty, self-rated walking limitation) predicted use of specialized discharge planning services with sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 78%. The developers are currently exploring how to obtain the variables directly from the electronic health information system. Fairchild and colleagues created a prediction rule for the use of post-discharge medical services. 16 These services were defined as use of vi siting nurses or physical therapists, medical equipment, or placement in a reha bilitative or long-term care facili ty. Similar to the findings of Holland and colleagues, the prediction tool us es age and SF-36 physical function and social function scores to stratify patients with regard to their likelihood of n eeding discharge planning to arrange for post-discharge medical services. While the work of Holland and Fairchild may not directly pertain to the current effort discussed in this repo rt, the variables identified may have application to the next section on identifying the appropriate domains. 4. Candidate Domains for Inclus ion in an Assessment Tool Before discussing potential candi date domains to be included in a uniform PAC assessment instrument, it is important to re-emphasize several points made at the beginning of this chapter. First, the three primary purposes for this tool (facilitate appropriate post-hospital placement, provision of core patient informa tion to promote of safe and effi cient care transitions between care settings, and assessment of outcomes across se ttings and over time) must drive the selection of the domains. In other words, the developers need to begin with the desired outcomes and work backwards. Second, this tool will not be comprehensive in scope or content. Doing so Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 93 would likely guarantee a failed implementation and this new tool would end up on the shelf. Individual post-acute and long-term care settings will need to supplement the information contained in this tool with their own setting-sp ecific information. This includes information used to complete the MDS, OASIS, and IRF-PAI. It is conceivable that items from these instruments could be used to populate this new instrument and vice versa. Third, the c onstruction of this new instrument needs to be beneficiary-centere d, accounting for benefici ary preference(s) and beneficiary financial obligation, and it needs to acknowledge the central role assumed by family caregivers. Table 4.2 summarizes candidate info rmation that hospital staff rou tinely rely upon to facilitate appropriate post-hospital placement. Earlier in this chapter, a numbe r of factors beyond the purview of the hospital staff were articulated. The items included in this table are largely within the purview of hospital staff. This is not to sa y that each item is already gathered or used in a systematic way. For example, the first item, goals of care, is often not explicitly stated and often lacks the essential input of beneficiaries and th eir family caregivers. Further, articulating a beneficiary's skilled care needs requires a broader understanding than simply knowing what transpired during the hospital stay. It necessita tes taking the time to l earn what services the patient needed and among those, which were re ceived prior to hospita l admission. It also includes conferring with family caregivers to dete rmine if they are able and willing to sustain their current level of involvement, before giving them additional responsibilities. Table 4.2: Assessment to Determine Discharge Needs/Setting Goals of care\u2014rehabilitation, skilled nursing, monitoring, respite, palliation, reduce hospital visits/adherence, stabilize behavior Skilled nursing or rehab care needs (R N, PT, OT, ST) (Oxygen, suctioning, tracheostomy care, ostomy care, tube feeding, parental feeding, IV infusions, medications by injection, urinary catheter care, dialysis, wound care, pressure ulcer care) Patient's current residence and with whom Meets Medicare criteria for homebound (y/n) Current services receiving in home (pre-hospital) Current DME receiving (pre-h ospital or in hospital) Capacity to perform self-care (includes cognition/carry over learning) IADL supportive needs/ADL supportive needs (pre-morbid and current) Pre-morbid and current cognitive functional status Pre-morbid and current physical functional status Family caregiver willing and able to help with the execu tion of the care plan as ou tlined?

Ethnic or cultural considerations Infectious precautions Active problem list (including behavioral problems) Medication list (as it pertains to per diem) Prognosis/estimated duration of services Insurance/payor Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 94 As discussed earlier, the factor s that determine discharge plac ement are not well understood and nationally wide variation has been observed. Prediction tools are being developed but much work remains. Nevertheless, in the absence of an extensive research base, these decisions are being made thousands of time per day and a uniform PAC assessment instrument could help to bring greater standardization to an otherwise heterogeneous process. The domains listed in Table 4.2 could serve to drive bene ficiary placement to appropriate PAC settings. (Please note that the functional domains listed in this chapter are defined more specifically in Chapter 6.) For example, a beneficiary who suffered a stroke whose goal is primary rehabilitation and who has the functional reserve to withstand intense re habilitation would likely be best served in an IRF. In contrast, a beneficiary with advanced congestive heart failure whose goals are primarily palliative with transition to end- of-life care might be di scharged to a skilled nursing facility for initiation of hospice care. As another example, a beneficiary whose skilled care needs primarily included intravenous antibiotics and wound care for an infected lower extremity with secondary rehabilitative needs might be preferentially discha rged to a skilled nursing facility. Finally, a patient with intact cognitive function who prior to hospitalization was livi ng in her own home and managing her self-care without difficulty may return home with skilled home care services and daily visits from a concerned family caregiver. Table 4.3 includes a suggested set of domains that could be used to en sure provision of core patient information to promote safe and efficien t care transitions between care settings. The goal is to provide the receiving team of clinicians w ith a core set of information needed to provide high quality and safe care of the beneficiary. To reiterate, the domains included in Table 4.3 are but a subset of all possible item s that clinicians in acute, post-acute and long-term care settings may use in constructing a comprehensive care pl an for an individual beneficiary. The domains in this table represent a star ting point and undoubtedly, modificati ons will be made. This table was directly informed by the domains include d in the UNAI, the VA GEC, a Colorado-based collaborative project between hospitals, PAC provi ders, payors, and the QIO, and from a best practices report on care transitions based on the work of some of the nation's exemplary health delivery systems.17 The information included in Table 4.3 is design ed to help the receiving care team quickly develop an understanding of an individual benefi ciary from the standpoin t of functional status (pre-morbid as well present), the immediate care n eeds that require attent ion, an accurate and up- to-date medication list, self care ability and fa mily support, and insurance coverage. All too often an older adult exhibits some confusion relate d to an acute illness or a medication side effect and is incorrectly labeled as having Alzheimer's Di sease because key information such as this is unavailable. Once the potential domains for a uniform PAC asse ssment instrument are selected, an important next step will be to identify the most accurate and efficient sources of data collection to populate these fields. Administrative da ta is often the most efficient to use and can reduce provider burden but suffers from the fact that it does not include the majority of information in Tables 4.2 and 4.3. Clinician assessment has been the most commonly used approach for hospitals using their own assessment instruments. Accountabil ity for the completion and accuracy of this information has been a gray area. Finally, patient self-report would ultimately provide the most Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 95 useful information for promoting beneficiary- centered care and would ensure that patient preferences and family caregiver input is obtaine d. However, due to transient or progressive cognitive impairment, not all bene ficiaries are in a position to part icipate in such an assessment.

Communicating the Assessment With the domains selected and the source of in formation identified, the next question becomes how will the assessment be communicated from the hospital to PAC provider? The inadequacy of the current non-standardized approach pos es problems for both quality and safety. 17;18 Within our existing technology, the current options include communicating the information electronically (through interoperabl e electronic health information systems or e-mail), facsimile, U.S. Mail, or sending a paper copy of the assessment with the beneficiary. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 96 Similar to other national quality improvement and performance measurement initiatives, implementation of a uniform PAC assessment inst rument could also serve to promote more widespread use of health information technology. To date, most electronic health information systems are based in hospital or ambulatory settings with little to no extension into the post-acute and long-term care arenas.19 Ensuring interoperability across disparate information systems remains a significant challenge but could be ove rcome with the proper motivation and financial incentives that would stimulate pr oviders' interest in making this investment. However, before existing software can support auto -population of comparable fields to promote cross-site data transfer, standards will need to be developed and approved for many of the items included in Tables 4.2 and 4.3. Beyond the transmission of information in a timely accurate manner, promoting the use of health information technology potentially opens the door for the use of decision support software that may be able to identify high-risk beneficiaries and facilitate their placement to PAC settings based on the current state of evidence. Hea lth information technology could facilitate the assessment of outcomes across settings and time, thereby creating the opportunity for performance measurement and pa y-for-performance initiatives. 6. How a Hospital Discharge Assessment Tool Could Support Pay-for-Performance The Institute of Medicine's re cently released report on Performance Measurement encourages CMS to address the current measurement ga ps, including the need for comprehensive measurement, longitudinal measurement, patien t-, population-, and system-level measurement and shared accountability. The IOM report specifically identifie s measures of continuity and transitions as priority areas. Thus, in many respects, the IOM report has set the stage for how a uniform PAC assessment instrument might s upport a value-based purchasing or pay-for- performance initiative. The National Quality Forum has issued calls for measures of care coordination out of the hospital and in ambulatory care as well. A gradual or phased-in pay-for-performance appro ach may be preferred over a more ambitious full-scale implementation. For example, providers might first be given a differential payment for simply completing the PAC assessment instrument. Next, the bar would be raised such that the differential payment would only be issued for the accurate completion of the assessment. This is particularly important for transfers between acute and PAC providers. For example, there are often problems with accountability and accompanying \"finger-poin ting\" about skin integrity whereby each provider blames the other for a ne w pressure ulcer. Further, as with any assessment, there is a risk that the clinician ma y indicate that an assessment has been completed without actually completing the assessment. This is particularly important for activities that assess a beneficiary's capacity for self-care. F eedback loops that include beneficiary self-report will be needed. Next, the added payment would only be made if the information from the assessment were transmitted in a timely manner. Finally, payment would be made for the achievement of outcomes that are based upon th e uniform PAC assessment instrument. Using this approach, CMS leaders and Congress will ha ve a better understand ing of the value of services paid for by the CMS budget. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 97 7. Facilitating the Implementation of a Hospital Discharge Assessment Tool The successful implementation of a uniform PA C assessment instrument across acute, post- acute, and long-term care providers will ultimate ly hinge on obtaining the support and \"buy-in\" from provider groups and professional societies. Clinicians working in these settings are overextended and mandating a new assessment that is perceived to not dir ectly benefit patient care will be met with strong resistan ce. It is essential that this new assessment is not viewed as simply a check off list but rather be seen as an interactive process that promotes healing relationships. It is also critical that this new assessment does not detract from clinicians' face-to- face time with beneficiaries, as this is already inadequate for supporting post-hospital self-care activities. Thus it is worth considering the potential advant ages a uniform PAC assessment instrument may offer. From the standpoint of the hospital, implementing a sta ndardized assessment tool that facilitates appropriate pl acement could potentially expedite discharge planning, resulting in an overall reduction in hospital leng th of stay. With increasing attention and rigor planned for future JCAHO surveys, an assessment tool may enhance a hospital's accreditation. Many hospitals have embraced patient safety initiative s and the timely and accurate communication of a core set of clinical information could be enc ouraged as a patient safety goal. Additional advantages might include less re dundancy in assessment, presuming that for beneficiaries re- admitted to the same facility, the assessment could be updated rather than began anew. Hospitals may also see the value in having to only complete a single assessment for all potential PAC transfers, rather than having to fill out a ne w form for each potential provider group. Finally, should the IHI transition out of the hospital pr ogram prove successful, CMS could work with the QIOs to promote widespread adoption of this model.

Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 100Chapter 5 Longitudinal Outcome Monitoring across PAC Settings A. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND As discussed in Chapter 1, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has acknowledged that steps need to be taken toward developing a PAC system in the United States that provides payment and assures quality for an overall episode of PAC, rather than for each individual component within the continuum of ca re. As an essential step toward accomplishing this policy objective, assessment methods are n eeded to collect and compare relevant outcome and quality of care data across variou s sites where PAC is provided. Unfortunately, since each PPS system within PA C was developed independently for each PAC setting, patient-centered assessment systems used as the informational platforms for these new payment systems are distinct and setting specific. Consequently, a persistent barrier to fulfilling this policy mandate for PAC has been the inabil ity to achieve a standardized, patient-centered outcome assessment approach that can provide CMS and other interested stakeholders with appropriate information on outcomes and quality of care that can be applied over time, and across different settings where PAC services are provided. 4 The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the reader to cont emporary methods for developing and evaluating outcomes measures which, we beli eve, provide the CMS with a methodology that can be implemented to track outcomes and quality of care provided acro ss entire episodes of PAC. In the first section of this chapter we will summarize the major limitations in traditional methodology for assessing health outcomes. We will then briefly introduce contemporary measurement concepts of Item Response Theory (IRT) and Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) methods as alternatives to the traditional approaches used to a ssess and monitor PAC outcomes. Finally, we will explain how contemporary technique s for measuring outcomes can be used as a strategy to achieve episode-wide assessment in PAC and discuss some recommendations to CMS for implementing episode-wide outcomes assessment and monitoring in PAC. B. SCOPE OF VARIABLES To recap, there are three primary purposes for uniform PAC patient outco mes assessment that are the focus of this report: 1) assessment at the point of hosp ital discharge for the purpose of achieving appropriate PAC placement; 2) facilitating care transitions across PAC settings; and 3) outcome assessment for longitudinal monitoring of quality of care. The focus of Chapter 5 is on methods for achie ving longitudinal outcome assessment for the purpose of monitoring and improving the quality of care provided across an episode of PAC. We will not discuss assessment for the purposes of achieving appropriate PAC placement or for facilitating care transitions within an episode of PAC; however, we do believe that the contemporary measurement techniques described in this chapter may also have important applicability for assessments aimed at hospita l discharge placement and to facilitate care transitions across PAC settings. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 101 In this chapter, we will use the example of f unctional status for the purpose of illustrating the application of contemporary measurement methods to PAC. In putting forth recommendations on the need and potential for standardizing patie nt-centered data collect ion for the purposes of quality monitoring and quality assurance purposes , the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics(NCVHS)5 was unanimous in recommending information on a patient's functional status for inclusion in such qua lity monitoring systems. Consistent with the NCVHS recommendations, in this chapter we use the term functional status very broadly to include an individual's ability to carry out activities of daily living (ADL s and IADLs) as well as their participation in advanced functional activities. C. SHORTCOMINGS OF TRADITIONAL MEASUREMENT METHODS Outcome systems in PAC traditionally take the form of analyses at a single-item or multiple-item (instrument) level. A single-item approach empl oys a functional status qu estion that stands alone and can estimate a patient's func tional status at a point in tim e or data on functional change. Single items have been identified, for example, on the OASIS as target outcomes for a given clinical sample.6 Although a single item outcome appro ach has the advantage of simplicity of use and direct interpretability,7 it has important limitations. Single items can be much less reliable than an instrument comprising multiple items, and since outcomes such as functional status outcomes are complex, they may not lend themselves to valid measurement and tracking using a single item.8 With a multiple-item instrument, each item is designed to sample content important to the underlying outcome, leading to improved reliability, validity, precision, and responsiveness in comparison to a single item. There are numerous well-respected, multiple-item functional outcome instruments in widespread use within PAC. 9-13 Some have developed aggregate scoring systems and sub-domain scores by summing raw scores (such as the FIM), and others are primarily analyzed at the single-item level (such as MDS).14 A barrier toward developing meaningful summary scores for certain multiple- item instruments used in PAC (such as the OASIS ) is the varying respons e scales across OASIS items, which range from 4 to 6 categories. Us ing conventional methods, certain items may be weighted more based on a greate r number of response categories.15 Most existing functional status instruments that generate and em ploy summary scores have been created under the umbrella of Classical Test Theory (CTT), a set of assumptions and psychometric procedures that have been widely used to develop tests for much of the 20th century.16 The defining signature of functional stat us instruments developed using CTT is the use of a fixed set of questions (or items) presented to a respondent, regardless of the appropriateness of any specific item for a given PA C patient. [In this discussion we will use the term respondent when referring to the person who is completing the functional status assessment. The respondent can be a patient re ceiving care, one or more clinicians providing care, or a family member or significant other serving as a proxy respondent for a patient]. Items in most traditional instruments are selected or written to represent a moderate range of functions at a moderate level of difficulty or limitation. By selecting items that are fairly homogeneous, acceptable levels of reliability a nd validity with a limited number of items can best be achieved. The major limitation of CTT for application in PAC is the reliance on a fixed set of items (test- Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 102dependency) that are expected to measure functio nal status across a wide variety of patients and settings.17 As was stated earlier, separate instruments ha ve been developed for each PAC setting. Data incompatibility across PAC instruments renders the ability to track relevant outcomes across different care settings almost impossible to accomp lish. For example, a recent attempt to rescale items from the MDS-PAC to FIM-like items in a desire to explore whether the MDS-PAC could be substituted for the FIM was not sufficien tly accurate to ensure payment equity.18 Because each instrument used a different set of items, rating scales, and different administration and scoring rules, payment cell classification using FI M data agreed with th at using MDS-PAC data only 56% percent of the time.19 Instead of developing translati onal cross-walks across different functional status instruments, some have argued for the development of a core set of functional items that could be used to monitor functional outcomes across PAC settings. 4 To be useful, this core set would need to contain items that cover a wide range of the functional status continuum with good measurement precision at all levels.20-22 In a recent study, we assessed the test precision us ing test information function across four key setting-specific functional status instruments used within PAC.23 This was done in an attempt to identify whether one traditional functional status instrument could be used for the expressed purpose of monitoring the quality of PAC over time, and across different settings where PAC is provided. In a sample of PAC patients, we coll ected functional status ite ms from standardized instruments including, the 18-item Functional Independence Measure (FIM TM)12 for persons in inpatient rehabilitation setti ngs, 19 Minimum Data Set (MDS)24 items (physical functioning and selected cognitive items) for persons in skille d nursing home settings, 19 ADL/IADL items from the Standardized Outcome and Assessment Info rmation Set for Home Health Care (OASIS)10 for persons receiving home care, and the 10 physical functioning items of the SF-36 for individuals receiving outpatient services.25 In Figure 5.1, the measurement precision of each instrument is depicted by its unique test information function curve. These curves are superimposed with the average score on the functional continuum and \u00b12 sd for the inpatients and community samples. Note the location of the peak amount of precision for each instrument in relationship to each sample. Although the OASIS items contain a broad range of content, they provide a high degree of measurement precision at only the very low e nd of functional status dimens ion for both the inpatient and community samples. The precision of MDS items is also greatest at the lower functional status dimension levels, although the MDS items have a greater span of functioning in which they provide some levels of precision. The FIM item s peak at the low to moderate end of the inpatient sample. In contrast, the information function of the PF-10 items peaks at the high end of the community functioning sample with ve ry poor precision for the inpatient sample. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 103Figure 5.1: Test Precision of FIM, MDS, OASIS, and PF-10 The results of these analyses il lustrate the challenge of finding or constructing one instrument with sufficient precision across a broad range of functional status. In our judgment, none of the instruments examined in this study achieved an acceptable level of pr ecision across the broad continuum of function for longitudinal monitoring of function in PAC. B ecause setting-specific functional status instruments are geared to the functional level of patient s in a particular PAC setting, those patients at either end of the functional continuum covered by a particular instrument tend to be poorly defined. The FIM, for example, yields serious ceiling effects when applied to home care patients, while the PF-10 possesses serious fl oor effects when applied with more disabled populations. Ceiling and floor effect s are serious concerns when functional status instruments are applied for quality of care mon itoring. It is impossibl e to distinguish among patients at the ceiling or floor, even though they ma y be functionally different in important ways. For quality of care monitoring, ceilin g effects produce serious type II errors in testing whether or not outcomes have improved in PAC patient po pulations, while it is equally difficult to determine if there have been important decl ines in function for persons at the floor. A final comment on practicality should be men tioned. Using a CTT approach, it is impractical for any one instrument to include the number of items necessary to yield precise measures across the wide range individuals' function as th ey progress throughout an episode of PAC.22 Patients and/or clinicians are of ten frustrated by being asked to res pond to items that seem redundant, of low relevance, or take considerable time to complete.26 The resulting length and complexity of such approaches may be problematic and rais e concerns over respondent burden, administration The Different Domain Information Function Distribution -2.52.57.512.517.522.527.5 20 30 40 50 60 70 Personal Ability MDS I tems OASIS Items PF-10 Items FIM Items Series1 Series6 InpatientsCommunity Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 104costs, and acceptability to users. The \"ideal \" measure, possessing enough questions to cover the full content range with a high degr ee of precision at all relevant levels, however, is impractical when using traditional measurement technol ogy. Although the applicat ion of traditional functional status instruments have led to importa nt insights into PAC pr actice, we believe the deficiencies inherent in CTT methodology have impeded progress toward achieving a successful uniform methodology for monitoring, managing, and improving the outcomes of services provided to PAC patients across the entire episode of care.23;27 D. A PARADIGM SHIFT: CONT EMPORARY MEASUREMENT METHODS Precise measurement of functional status at all le vels is a critical feature of any measurement method proposed for monitoring outcomes for th e purpose of quality of care determination across the entire continuum of PAC. The assessment goal at each point in time is to match the level of item difficulty to the ability level of the patient at any particular point in the PAC episode, and thus provide a set of items in an assessment that closely corresponds to the current functional level of the patient.17 There is a way to achieve feasible, practical, and precise measurement of functional stat us through the conjoint use of two Contemporary Measurement Theory methods, a test administration method known as Computer Adaptive Testing (CATs) coupled with a measurement theory known as Item Response Theory (IRT) .17;28-31 1. Computer Adaptive Testing CAT selects test items tailored to an individual pa tient, shortens or length ens the test to achieve the desired precision of measurement, scores every patient on the same underlying outcome continuum so that results can be compared acro ss the continuum of that outcome, and displays the results instantly for immediate interpretation and use. CAT ad ministration requires computer technology to administer the instrument and is adap tive in the sense that each item administered is tailored to the unique outcome le vel of a patient. Each responde nt is administer ed a different version of the instrument because individual items are selected based on the respondent's previous answers. The basic notion of a CAT test is to mimic what an experienced clinician does. A clinician learns most when he/she direct s questions at the patient's appr oximate level of proficiency. Administering outcome items that represent tasks that are either too easy or too hard for the patient provides little information. In contrast to traditional, fixed form functional tests that ask the same questions of everyone regardless of how the respondent answers, CAT instruments, like a skilled clinician, tailor their assessment by aski ng only the most informative questions based on a person's responses to previous questions. A CAT is programmed to first present an item fr om the mid-range of a defined list of functional items, and then directs subsequent functional items to the level based on the respondent's previous responses, without asking unnecessary que stions. The selection of an item in the mid- range is arbitrary and the CAT can be set to select an initial item based on other information entered about the patient such as age, diagnosis , or severity of thei r condition. By having comprehensive item banks available in each functi onal outcome domain of interest, the selection of additional items after the initia l one is based on responses to the previous items. This allows Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 105for fewer items to be administered while gainin g precise information regarding an individual's placement along an outcome continuum.32 An important advantage of CAT is the ability to update the item bank and the CAT programs easily as new items become available. Since ite m banks are built using an IRT model, items can be updated, changed, or removed without disputing the overall functional scale and scoring metric. For example, if new items were writte n that have potential advantages over existing items, or cover content that is not currently in the item bank, those items could be imbedded in a CAT program. These new items would not be part of the current scoring system, but rather would be \"test items.\" These new items could then be examined in an IRT analysis to determine if they fit the functional scale, have content advantages over curre nt items, and have locations on a functional scale that fill in a content gap, and then subsequently be incorporated into the next revision of the CAT program. Although relatively new in the health fiel d, CAT methodology is already commonplace in knowledge-based testing situati ons. For example, the Graduate Record Examination, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, and the Test of Englis h as a Foreign Language, as well as numerous professional credentialing and licensure examinations use CAT methodology. CAT methods reduce instrument administration times dramatically while allowing test pr ecision to be tailored to the specific needs of a particular testing s ituation or context. Large educational testing organizations that provide services for colleg e entrance are constantly testing new items in existing exams so that new items that better refl ect the construct of inte rest are being developed for future assessments. If introduced into PAC assessment, we could conceive of a constant process of new item writing and cost-effectiv e improvement in functional assessment by improving the items available for individual CAT assessments. This could be accomplished without changing the underlying sc oring metric, so that validity data needed to anchor and interpret scores would not have to be redone after every CAT revision. 2. Item Response Theory IRT methods open the door to understanding the linkages among items used to assess a common outcome domain, and in this way serve as th e psychometric foundation underlying CAT. IRT methods examine the associations between individua ls' responses to a series of items designed to measure a specific outcome domain (e.g., functional status). 17;33;34 IRT measurement models are a class of statistical procedures used to develop measurement sc ales. The measurement scales are comprised of items with a known relationshi p between item responses and positions on an underlying functional domain, called an item character istic curve. The form of the relationships is typically non-linear. Using th is approach, probabilities of patients scoring a particular response on an item at various functional ability levels can be modeled. Persons with more functional ability have higher probabilities of responding positively to functional items than persons with lower functional abil ities. These probability estimates are used to determine the individual's most likely positi on along the functional dimensi on. When assumptions of a particular item response theory model are met, estimates of a person's functional ability do not strictly depend on a particular fixed set of items . This scaling feature allows one to compare persons along a functional outcome dimension even if they have not completed the identical set of functional items. Since item s and functional outcome scores are defined on the same scale, Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 106items can be optimally selected to provide good estimates of each outcome at any level of the scale. This feature of IRT creates important fl exibility in administering tests in a dynamic and tailored approach for each individual. E. THE ACTIVITY MEASURE FOR POST ACUTE CARE At Boston University, our research group has de voted six years to de veloping, evaluating, and refining a group of functional status measures bu ilt with contemporary measurement techniques. These measures are designed to examine functiona l status outcomes across the full spectrum of PAC settings including inpatient rehabilita tion, long-term care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home care, and outpatien t rehabilitation clinics. Our main functional status instrument is called the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC). 35 The AM-PAC is a functional status measure de veloped using the World Health Organization's International Classification of Func tioning, Disability and Health (ICF). 36 Within the ICF, an Activity Outcome is defined as \"the execution of a task or action by an individual,\" making it consistent with the definition of functional status used in this chapter. In developing the AM- PAC, we employed two different samples of over 1000 patients who received PAC in acute inpatient rehabilitation units, tr ansitional care units, home care, and ambulatory care settings.37;38 Based on factor analytic work and IRT analyses,35;39 three distinct func tional status domains have been identified and confirmed: (a) Physical & Movement Activities; (b) Personal & Instrumental Activities; and (c) Applied Cognitive Activities . The Applied Cognitive Activity domain reflects difficulties or inability to perform basic communication, social and daily management activ ities (e.g., use of prin t information, speaking and understanding, interpersonal skills). The domai n of Personal Care & Instrumental Activity encompasses primarily basic personal care and in strumental ADLs. The Physical & Movement Activity domain includes basic physical activ ities such as bending, walking, carrying, or climbing stairs. The classification of specific activ ities into these three factors is not identical to the ADL and IADL distinction made in Chapter 2 nor Chapter 6; however , these three factors contain a mix of function that ma y be classified differently by other authors. What they are called is less critical than what is included in each factor. In developing the AM-PAC, we constructed an underlying functional status item pool of 101 Movement & Physical Activity items, 62 Pers onal & Instrumental Activity items, and 59 Applied Cognitive Activity items. We developed an initial pool of func tional items based on the following: input from measurement and content e xperts, suggestions solicited from several focus groups of persons with disabilitie s, and a comprehensive literatur e review. We selected items underscored by our consumer participants that were perceived as pertinent to their own ability to regain competence in daily activities during a PA C episode. Some items were modified from existing PAC functional instruments such as th e FIM, MDS, OASIS, and PF-10, but adapted to the common difficulty and assistance response categories used for AM-PAC item pool. We framed the activity questions in a general fashi on without specific attribut ion to health, medical Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 107conditions, or disabling factors. AM-PAC data were collected by se lf-report, administered either by the participant's clinician, or by a trained da ta collector. In 3% of the cases, a proxy respondent (health provider or fa mily member) provided the data. A series of adaptive short forms and a CAT vers ion of the AM-PAC have been developed and have undergone beta testi ng in various PAC samples.40 We will use a patient case to illustrate below how the AM-PAC CAT works. This case uses the Physical & Movement Activity scale of the AM-P AC. In this scale, we assume that the midpoint of the scale is 50, and this serves as the initial (default) score estimate prior to the CAT administration. For this case example, we used data collected in our Rehabilitation Outcome Study. 41 We set the CAT precision st opping rule as a 95% CI < 3.0. The patient is an individual with congestive heart failure. Patient A is a 74-year old female who is recove ring from congestive heart failure and is being discharged home after an eight-day hospital stay. She has mild arthritis and is leaving the hospital able to only walk for short distances. She is scheduled to have home care visits to assist her with mobility and self-care ac tivities at home. Prior to leav ing the hospital, she is asked a series of CAT generated AM-PAC questions regarding her current m obility status. Three months later, she is also asked to respond to CAT-gene rated AM-PAC questions by her home health care provider to update her functiona l mobility changes. The resu lts from these two functional assessments are illustrated in Table 5.1. Table 5.1: Illustrative F unctional Assessments Usin g AM-PAC CAT Methodology Physical Functioning CAT at Hospital Discharge Physical Functioning CAT at Follow-up (3 months post-hospital discharge) Question Response Score Estimate and (SE) Question Response Score Estimate and (SE) Standing up from a chair? Lot of difficulty 38.4 (7.9) Standing up from a chair? No difficulty 44.3 (8.4) Standing for one minute? Little difficulty 36.5 (5.4) Walking outdoors? (100 meters) No difficulty 56.3 (7.3) Walking indoors (50 meters)? Lot of difficulty 35.9 (4.3) Lifting 10 pound object? Little difficulty 59.2 (5.3) On and off toilet?

Little difficulty 60.4 (3.0) Final Hospital Discharge Physical Functioning Score Estimate 35.6 (2.9) Final 3-month Post-hospital Discharge Physical Functioning Score Estimate 60.4 (3.0) Note that the patient's responses at hospital discharge indicate that she was functioning at a low level, and therefore the CAT pr ovided AM-PAC questions that a ddressed these low levels of mobility. At the 3-month follow-up assessment, her responses to the AM-PAC clearly indicated that she was no longer limited in basic mobility and had progressed considerably in physical functioning. The CAT at this phase tailored items in response to the higher levels of functioning Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 108noted by her responses and provided an assessmen t using more challenging items, yet the two assessments were scored on the same underlying metric. During the 3-month period she improved from a 35.6 score to a 60.4 functional level on the AM-PAC Physical & Movement Scale. The CAT provided an estimate of functio nal ability after she responded to each item, and continued that estimation until some stop-rule based on number of items or precision was satisfied. By adapting to her responses, the CAT yielded questions that we re designed especially for her estimated level of ability, and thus pr ovided a precise estimate of her function at each time point with fewer questions than a fixed-leng th form where she would have been asked the same questions each time. 1. AM-PAC's Sensitivity to Change Using Adaptive Short Form versions, the ut ility of the AM-PAC was employed in a Rehabilitation Outcomes Study, 41 to track the functional outco mes of 435 PAC patients. These adults were recruited at the point of disc harge from an acute care hospital or on admission to a rehabilitation hospital and followed for 1, 6, and 12 months through their entire episode of PAC. By linking scores across different Adapti ve Short Form versions of the AM-PAC, we tracked the pattern of f unctional recovery for this cohort acro ss all settings where they received PAC. Sensitivity analyses of the AM-PAC comp ared with the FIM revealed that the AM-PAC adaptive short forms reduced ceiling effects and increased sensitivity to change at 6 and 12 months follow-ups as compared to the FIM. 42 In a recently completed project of a 3-month fo llow-up of patients who were tested after being discharged from inpatient rehabilitation, we foun d the CAT programs to be equally responsive to patient-reported change over a 3-m onth interval as compared to fi xed-length forms with covering three functional content domains (66 items). On average, the CAT programs required 43% of the time and 33% of the items compared to the fixed-form alternative. We concluded that accurate estimates for group-level functional changes can be obtai ned from CAT administrations, with a considerable reduc tion in administration time. 38 2. Clinical Meaningfulness of AM-PAC Scores At this stage of development, the clinical m eaningfulness of specific scores on each AM-PAC functional domain scale has yet to be identifie d. However, with additional testing in larger samples of patients receiving PAC, we believe it is feasible to pred ict clinically important levels of functional status on the AM-PAC scales. As an illustration of how this might be accomplished, we estimated the scale value of th e AM-PAC Physical & Movement Activity that optimized the ability to predic t unlimited community participati on 6 months after a hip fracture for the 53 hip fracture patients in our Rehabili tation Outcomes Study. The Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) analys is illustrated in Figure 5.2 gra phically depicts the relationship between the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) rela tive to Sensitivity and False Positive Rate (1- Specificity) across values of th e AM-PAC's Physical & Movement Activity scale. The binary outcome being predicted is unlimited community participation measured by answering the following question: \"Think about how you go places, using any help or me ans of transportation available. How much are you limited in getting ar ound?\" As the illustration shows, 6 months Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 109after suffering a hip fracture, an AM-PAC Physi cal & Movement scale score of 70 achieves a PPV of approximately 0.80. Figure 5.2: Predicting Community Participat ion with AM-PAC Scores 6 Months Post Hip Fracture 3. Applications Using the AM-PAC CAT The AM-PAC has been implemented and/or by a nu mber of private health systems throughout the country, as described below. a. Merck Phase 2 Clinical Trial (currently underway): The AM-PAC CAT is being used as a functional endpoint in a 24-w eek, double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, multi- national, study that is assessing the safety and efficacy of a compound (MK-0677) developed by Merck Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of sarcope nia in patients recovering from hip fracture. In preparation for use as en endpoint in this trial, the AM-PAC was translated into 7 languages: British English, Spanish, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and Hebrew. b. HealthSouth Outpatient Di vision (currently underway): During 2005, a AM-PAC CAT Clinical Outcomes Monitoring System was pilot tested with 20 HealthSouth (HS) outpatient rehabilitation practices located in Texas, Connecticut, New Jersey, Florida, and Virginia. During the pilot, 6,000 AM-PAC CAT patient assessments were performed. This pilot was very successful. A new contract was executed in Oc tober 2005, to expand from 20 pilot sites to 190 HS sites located in several regions where HS ope rates. The roll out began in January 2006. HS has identified 450 outpatien t sites, which would be nefit from the software and the plan is to expand to all sites. c. SeniorMetrix (currently underway): SeniorMetrix, a case management company, currently uses the FIM instrument as the key functional a ssessment instrument to assess inpatients.

As a first step, a research study to develop a crosswalk between the two instrument s will be jointly undertaken. If the crosswalk is successful, Seniormetrix will begin using the AM-PAC instead of the FIM. d. Kaiser Permanente of Northern California (cu rrently underway): An agreement was reached with Kaiser to implement the AM-PAC CAT system in Northern California. In 2006, a 6-month pilot study will be conducted in an outpa tient site run in the Napa Solano Area. If successful, expansion to other areas within Kaiser is likely. Kaiser has asked to use AM-PAC in a study proposal they are writing in th e area of multiple sclerosis. e. Select Medical (under discussion): Select Medical is a company with over 700 outpatient rehabilitation locations and is similar to Health South. The plan is to establish an AM-PAC CAT monitoring system in thei r outpatient sites during 2006. F. DATA COLLECTION METHODS Understanding variation across resp ondents who provide informati on on functional status is an important step in the process of creating a sound outcome instrument for PAC. This examination is especially important if the functional assessment will be used to examine recovery of daily activities over time and across se ttings, as more than one responde nt may be required. Currently, established practice in most hospital and home care settings relies on clinician-based assessments. However, long-term outcome mon itoring and examining fu nctional recovery in community settings (e.g., outpatient programs) are likely to require patien t-reported data. In addition, some patients cannot prov ide their own information on function due to limitations in cognitive or communication abilities. Our rese arch has found acceptable proxy-patient reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) = 0.68-0.90) across functional domains on the Activity Measure for Post-acute Care (AM-PAC) with the lowest ratings for the items included within the Applied Cognition domain. 43 We have also found that discre pancies are more likely to occur in early stages of recovery during which patients may not be able to successfully self-report.44 The combination of proxy reports from family memb ers or clinicians with patient report is controversial and information on the variation introduced by pr oxy respondents is necessary.45;46 Variance in functional status be tween respondents would need to be carefully examined and scores would need to be adjusted as systematic effects in respondent di fferences are established in each functional domain. G. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. CAT-based Monitoring System To achieve its long-term goal of longitudinal monitoring of functi onal status and other relevant outcomes across PAC settings, we propose that CMS consider launching a large-scale demonstration project to examine the feasibility and utility of adopting IRT and CAT methods to develop PAC outcome measures that are psychome trically adequate, comprehensive and precise to monitor change across an entire PAC episode while being practical for widespread application and use across settings. We further recommend that CMS consider using the AM-PAC for the purpose of testing the utility of the IRT/CAT approach to fu nctional status assessment and Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 111monitoring across PAC settings. There are several reasons to c onsider using the AM-PAC in a field demonstration of this method. 1. The AM-PAC instrument was designed speci fically for cross sett ing functional status monitoring in PAC. 2. IRT item banks for 3 functional domains have been developed and have undergone initial testing and evaluation with over 1000 PAC patient s. The item banks have been reviewed by content experts, consumer groups, and have undergone cognitive testing and subsequent revision. 3. Adaptive short form and CAT versions of the 3 AM-PAC functional domains have been developed and have undergone beta testing in PAC patient samples. 4. Given the developmental work already done on the AM-PAC, a large-scale field demonstration could be designed and la unched in a short period of time. Testing of CAT models have been reported in rehabilitation and PAC settings, and early results are promising. 40;47-49 We believe there is sufficient evidence to date to suggest that a CAT system could provide a workable model for longitudinal assessment of functional status outcomes in PAC. Using the CAT method has the potential to decrease the response burden of assessment, while providing an individually-tailo red assessment at each recovery stage. The National Institutes of Health have recently includ ed computer-adapted testing approaches as part of their Roadmap,50 and have funded major multi-year CA T projects for clinical research applications.51 These major initiatives are designed to develop more uniformity in outcome endpoints used for clinical trials and to capitalize on the efficien cy and precision advantages of contemporary approaches towards estimating health status changes. A clear parallel can be drawn for the need to use a similar appro ach to the measurement requirements of PAC monitoring. To undertake a field demonstration of the CAT version of the AM -PAC, access to a CAT platform would be needed in each participating ho spital, and then a system would need to be in place to access the CAT data in the PAC setting and to complete longitudinal data collection. Providers conducting each assessment would need so me type of PDA, sta nd-alone computer, or Internet access. Point-of-contact computing power is necessary si nce the order of CAT questions administered requires real time computing power in developing a score estimate and the application of an algorithm to choose an optimal item at after each respondent response. Once established, the CAT platform could provide an optimal system for acquiring accurate and efficient assessments in a uniform PAC outcome monitoring system. If such a CAT platform were not available, an alternative approach w ould be to use a series of Adaptive Short Form versions of the AM-PAC for the field demonstration. 2. CAT Test Development for Other PAC Outcomes We recommend that CMS consider undertaking a series of development projects aimed at developing contemporary measurement method a pproaches to assessing outcomes across PAC settings for outcomes other than functional status . Development of an initial CAT strategy for monitoring other PAC outcomes across PAC setti ngs would take 3-5 years and would require Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 112several stages of methodological development. Let us use the example of cognitive status outcomes again to illustrate each stage of development. The first stage would involve assembling, testing, and revising item banks designed to tap each cognitive status domain of interest. For exam ple, one domain could encompass basic reasoning, and another might cover memory or problem solving skills. An item bank consists of individual instrument items or questions that are drawn or written to match a specific functional domain of interest. In the case of cognitive status item banks, items can be drawn from existing fixed-form instruments or newly written. A separate item bank would need to be developed for each domain of cognitive status to be included within the overall instrument. An appropriate rating scale would need to be selected or developed for each cognitive status domain to maximize measurement reliability and va lidity as well as to maximi ze respondent understanding. The second stage would be to c onduct cognitive interviews with re levant PAC patient groups to obtain the in-depth information on the patient's u nderstanding of the items included in the item banks and the need for item revision or rewo rding to enhance understanding and clarity. Cognitive testing can also be useful in identifyi ng gaps in item content within a cognitive domain that may need to be addressed with newly written or revised items. The third developmental phase would be the ap plication of IRT met hodology to evaluate the usefulness of each item included in the item bank, particularly its relative difficulty on the underlying continuum for that particular cognitive do main. This step requires that cognitive item banks be administered to a large sample of PAC patients so that IRT techniques can be subsequently applied to build new instruments, s cale responses, and equate scores, as well as to identify item bias that may need to be elim inated. These IRT methods are the foundation on which CAT methodology is implemented. Various IRT mathematical models can be used to estimate the association between an individual's cognitive abili ty and item difficulty on the instrument's item bank. In the fourth stage of development work, info rmation on a patient's ability on a particular cognitive domain and the item's known difficulty on the underlying continuum is used to develop efficient CAT algorithms and to equate different forms of a given CAT test with each other. This is the key feature of CAT methodol ogy that allows differe nt users of the same underlying item bank to speak a shared language even though individuals may be responding to different items included in the item bank. In the fifth and final stage, a series of validati on studies would have to be undertaken to provide interpretation guidelines for diffe rent levels of cognitive scores generated by the CAT cognitive status instrument. This could take the form of predictive validity studies where different threshold levels of the CAT-generated cognitive st atus scores are used to predict relevant and important PAC outcomes such as length of stay in a setting, discharge from one care setting to another, or other outcomes of interest such as mortality risk, hospital readmission, or community or social participation levels. A CAT system could ultimately also provide a basis for grouping patients into cognitive groups for use in prospective payment systems. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 1133. Alternative Strategies a. Summary Score Cross-Calibration: If CMS is unable to adopt a CAT approach in the short term, a strategy CMS might consider is to equate summary scores from ex isting functional status instruments using an IRT cross-calibration appr oach. This method places corresponding items from two instruments on the same scale to de velop linkages and summa ry score correspondence tables.52;53 Using this IRT approach, one or more functional status in struments could be calibrated to the metric of another instrument , provided the two scales are measuring similar underlying functional constructs. Th is provision is critical in usi ng an IRT approach, since a key assumption of these models is that items from one or more instruments are one-dimensional. The summary score cross-calibration approach w ould require a calibration sample of patients who completed each instrument that was to be cr oss-calibrated. A series of IRT analyses would be completed to confirm the unidimensionality of the combined item set, an estimation of the item parameters, and the development of expected value curves superimposed on the combined underlying metric. By way of illustration, Figure 5.3 displays a cross- calibration we developed of scores from the six MDS-PAC functional items and five mobility items of the FIM (unpublished data). Using item parameters developed across the two instrume nts, we developed expected scores for each instrument at each level of the overall mobility continuum. The FIM items are on a 5-35 metric, and the MDS-PAC is on a 0-35 metric. On bot h scales, higher scores indicate increasing physical functioning ability. An expected total sc ore can be obtained for either the AM-PAC or the FIM at any level of the underlying scale. Based on this figure, a correspondence table (Table 5.2) could be developed that links the scores from one instrument to another.

An advantage of this approach is that it combines items into a common metric. However, if the content coverage of the items w ithin the two instruments is similar, then no additional content coverage beyond the range of either instrument b ecomes available. If the items from the two instruments cover different conten t, then a broader range of func tional status can be assessed by a combination of items from the two instruments, ye t placed on a similar scale. Note in Figure 5.3 that the FIM has a broader content range than the MDS-PAC at the hi gher range of mobility functioning. This, of course, is the important advantage of using IRT methods; by combining items from multiple instruments, one can develop a uniform scale with broader content coverage than with any one instrument alone. b. Develop Adaptive (Parallel) Short-forms: A final interim strategy th at CMS might consider is the development and application of Adaptive Short Form instruments. There are several examples in health care applic ations that use adaptive short forms for measuring a functional construct across different levels of expected patient functioning54 or between PAC settings.37 The adaptive short form approach uses IRT as the basis for linking the two forms together on a common metric. This technique has the advant age of providing a means to compare functional scores across persons using diffe rent yet parallel short forms. Using adaptive short forms for different groups of patients in creases scaling efficiency over a single fixed form applied to everyone. Respondents need only respond to one form (a subset of the functional items that best targets their level of function based on the setting in which they are receiving PAC). While CAT scales would yield the larges t increases in efficiency, 40 adaptive short forms can provide an initial step toward improving measurement acr oss PAC settings while not increasing response burden. A key characteristic of the adaptive shor t form approach is that the functional items selected and used in the different short forms must all come from the same item bank. This approach links the forms together so that scores from each form can be compared, avoiding the problems of combining scores from two instrument s that have not been co-calibrated using IRT on the same metric. We recently developed a series of adaptive shor t forms to measure physical functioning across the PAC continuum. 37 We developed a short form of 10 optimal items for application in a Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 115hospital or facility setting, and 12 optimal items for patients who had returned to a community setting. Our reasoning was that questions on physi cal functioning for patients who were in the hospital should be centered toward the low abil ity end, and should not include outdoor walking or other items that would be meaningless to assess in the hospital setting. For community assessment (patients receiving home care or outpatient services), questions that were selected for inclusion were broader and evaluated higher leve ls of home and community mobility. The items selected for both forms were from an estab lished AM-PAC item bank, and so the items were linked to an underlying conti nuum and common score metric. 35 In a recent field trial of these adaptive short-forms in a 12-month follow-up of patients receiving reha bilitation, the adaptive forms were more sensitive to long-term cha nges at a 6- and 12-month follow-up period in comparison to a standard fixed form used typica lly at an early recovery stage in inpatient rehabilitation.42 Consider the following case example: Patient B is a 66-year old male who is recoveri ng from a fractured hip and pelvis from an automobile accident. He is being discharged home post-surgery after a six-day acute care hospital stay. He is only partially weight-bea ting on affected hip when discharged from the acute care hospital. He is scheduled to have home care visits to assist wi th mobility and transfer activities at home. Prior to leaving the hospital, he is asked a series of questions from a 10-item survey on his current physical functioning abilities. At six months after discharge, he is sent a form that asks him to update his current physical functioning status. Note in Table 5.3 that the two adaptive forms ha ve different questions, which are related to expected physical functioning in either the hospi tal or home setting. The ability to use the two parallel forms helps to spread the range of functioning that can be covered by questionnaires with relatively sma ll numbers of items.

CONCLUSIONS Precise measurement of functional status at all levels is a critical feature of any outcome assessment system proposed for quality of care determination across th e entire continuum of PAC. Computer Adaptive Testing (CATs) coupled with Item Response Theory (IRT) provides a way to achieve practical and precise meas urement and tracking of relevant outcomes throughout an entire episode of PAC. Although relatively new in the health field, CAT/IRT methodology is already commonplace in other fields. As an initial step toward developing a PAC monitoring system, we propose that CMS la unch a demonstration project to examine the feasibility and utility of a dopting IRT and CAT functional status instruments to monitor functional change across an entire PAC episode of care using the Activity Measure for Post Acute Care, developed by resear chers at Boston University. Te sting of CAT models has been reported in rehabilitation and PAC settings, and early results are promising. We believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that a CAT sy stem could provide a workable model for longitudinal assessment of functional status out comes in PAC. Using the CAT method has the potential to decrease the response burden of a ssessment, while providing an individually-tailored assessment at each recovery stage throughout an episode of PAC.

Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 121 Chapter 6 Conclusions and Recommendations In this chapter, we begin in Section A with a summary of the major findings in the report, which are referenced in earlier ch apters. Section B discusses the recommended domains and justification for these domains in a uniform assessment instrument. Section C presents a long- term vision and recommendations for assessment in post-acute care (PAC). Section D proposes a set of short-term recommendations, with partic ular emphasis on the first-year activities that would lead to the long-term vision. A. SUMMARY OF REPORT FINDINGS 1. Purposes of the Proposed Uniform Assessment Instrument This 10-week project was conducted to examine existing approaches to assessment for PAC and make recommendations to CMS on how to proceed w ith respect to uniform assessment. In PAC, we are including the inpatient settings of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), and acute long-term care hospita ls (ALTCs), as well as residential-based care provided by home health agencies (HHAs) and out patient programs. The three purposes of the instrument that we have highlighted for this report include: 1) making placement decisions related to the most appropriate PAC setting and services at hosp ital discharge; 2) serving as a core set of information that should be transmitted to the receiving provider to enhance the safety and quality of care tran sitions; and 3) providing baseline in formation for longitudinal follow-up of health and function, elements of which would be repeated over time. Given the settings that need to be covered and these three purposes, in essence the uniform assessment instrument needs to suit all Medicare beneficiaries discharged from the hospital. The major tradeoff in developing such an instrume nt is balancing burden w ith the desired set of information to characterize the full spectrum of the population of interest. For example, some might argue that disease-specific measures for th e major diagnoses ought to be incorporated into the instrument. However, the factors that are most important for these three purposes generally cut across conditions, and while dis ease-specific information is crit ical for care planning, it is not essential for these purposes. T hus, the assumption for this uniform assessment instrument is that it would be completed at hospital discharge, provid ing information that is useful to the receiving PAC site, but would not substitute for a clinical assessment conducte d at the site directed toward care planning and treatment. If CMS ultimately gravitates toward comparable site-specific assessments, this uniform assessment instrument could underlie the s ite-specific assessment tools, reducing the assessment burden at the PAC sites. Identifying uniform assessment items for the purpos es of determining payment or resource needs was also beyond the scope of this project. The proposed uniform assessment instrument is not intended to replace the payment variables that are included in the existing instruments. However, the fact that the proposed domains w ill be important for placement determinations and identification of transitio nal care needs suggests that some of the most important payment items will be included (although not necessarily using th e same metrics that are used in the current Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 122 instruments). For example, payment rates in the RUGs, CMGs, and HHRGs are driven more by measures of physical function than any other do mains, with the possible exception of service variables such as therapy provi ded. While the uniform assessment instrument may not include the exact same functional scales as used in those tools, function wi ll most certainly be included, and the proposed metric could ultimately be us ed to recalibrate payments across settings. A final point is that the purposes of an inst rument and the population of interest drive the selection of both the appropriate domains and specific measures. Approaching the development of the uniform assessment instrument without in itially clarifying the pu rposes and population would provide no framework for including or excl uding specific domains and for deciding on the appropriate measures. Thus, although it may seem eas iest to just select an assessment tool that was developed for some specific purpose within a certain population, such an approach would not lead to the optimal cross-site assessmen t tool with the lowest possible burden. 2. Current Post-Acute Care Instruments The MDS, OASIS, and IRF-PAI were developed from very different historical roots, without the intent of uniformity across assessments. In addi tion, they were developed for different purposes, none of which pertain to the firs t two purposes of the proposed instrument. As a result, lack of consistency in domains, measures, time interval s, and the nature of the questions makes it extremely difficult to generate clear and comparab le metrics across these in struments. None of these instruments, nor the vast ma jority of the measures in thes e instruments, can serve as the basis for a uniform assessment tool. However, work is underway to cross-walk or map the instruments to uniform metrics. A major issue in using one of these instrument s across settings or rendering the instruments comparable is that the items are not sensitive to conditions or functiona l abilities of patients across the full spectrum of the PAC population. For example, the MDS functional items are targeted at assessing function in nursing homes, a nd in fact were originally developed for the long-term nursing home population, which is gene rally more dependent than the IRF or HHA populations. The IRF-PAI functiona l items (FIM) were designed to be sensitive to changes in the IRF population, which is typically less de pendent than the SNF population and more dependent than the home health population; wher eas the OASIS items were designed for the less impaired home health population. In addition, the SF-36 was designed for the ambulatory care population with functional items that are sensitive to these patients' status. Thus, none of the scales are sensitive to functional status across the full spectrum of function, and the difference in the items and time frames makes it very difficult to scale them using the same metric. A major limitation of the existing systems is that they use outdated questionnaire and measurement designs, paper forms, and an infras tructure that once put in place are extremely difficult to change. The data collection and measurement methods used result in extremely burdensome forms because the same set of items is asked of every individual, even when a substantial portion of the items are irrelevant for a specific person and could be avoided based on previous responses. This situation would be ex acerbated if the uniform assessment instrument used the same questionnaire design because the spectrum of patients across PAC settings is far broader than the spectrum in any given setti ng. In addition, until we move away from the Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 123 widespread use of questionnaires administered on paper forms that have to be entered and transmitted, we not only are expending excessive res ources on this process but also will continue to be locked into a ri gid set of questions. Thus, the exis ting tools do not take advantage of information technologies or questionnaire desi gn and measurement development techniques that now exist. 3. Non-CMS Instruments and Measures Several attempts have been made to devel op uniform assessment instruments for various purposes: the VA Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) Referral Form, the Health Outcomes Survey (HOS), the Uniform Needs Assessment Instrument (UNAI), and the Continuing Care Record (CCR). Our conclusion after carefully re viewing these is that we do not recommend that any of them be used in its entirety by CMS as the uniform assessment instrument. These instruments generally focus on one segment of the population (e.g., HOS is largely for outpatient care) or have such gross measures of impairment that precise measurement of impairment across the full PAC spectrum would not be feasible (e.g., the VA GEC form has 9 dichotomous ADL/physical mobility items). Thus, the items would not meet all the purposes for the populations of interest for Medica re PAC. They also have some of the other weaknesses of existing CMS PAC instruments involving a fixe d item set requiring complex infrastructure, making the questions difficult to revise. Nevertheless, these initiatives all offer useful information both for measures of specific domains that will be necessary for the uniform assessmen t instrument, and technologies relating to IT infrastructure and large-scale data acquisition and monitoring effort s. Measures that have been developed, tested, and/or are in use, which will ultimately be recommended for the uniform assessment can and should be proposed from th ese various tools. Through consensus and testing, these efforts have certainly built knowle dge regarding the most important domains, as well as measures for those domains. In addition, many measures exist for the various domains of function, cognition, depression, etc. that have been developed in either comprehensive assessment tools or specific research activit ies. Development of a uniform assessment instrument should fully consider this research ba se in selecting measures rather than starting anew wherever possible. 4. Placement and Care Transitions Although most would argue that patient and care giver factors should drive placement decisions for PAC, other system and reimbursement issues such as bed availability, geographic area, and availability of coinsurance or co-payments, co me into play. Evidence-based criteria or algorithms for optimal placement in the most cost -effective settings for most patients with different conditions and characteri stics are lacking for PAC; however , the information set that is important to consider in making placement decisi ons has been suggested by a number of studies, which we will present within the discussion of recommended domains. Lack of a uniform information set at hospital discharge has made it impossible to develop specific norms for different settings, much less algorithms for clinic ians to use as guidelines for decision-making. The importance of patient- and ca regiver-reported items in th is information set cannot be underestimated. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 124 Providing a core set of information to patients, families, and receiving clinicians following hospital discharge has become increasingly evident to ensure safe and efficient care transitions. From the hospital side, this activity falls under th e broad rubric of discharge planning, which is being more fully incorporated into the JC AHO methodology for hospital quality review. A number of studies have demonstrated the benefi ts of communicating an accurate core set of information accompanied by interventions that assure this information is utilized. These studies have identified important domains for care transiti ons. A critical lesson fro m these studies is the need for assessment information that is both ti mely and accurate. Ideally, such information would be available electronically through inte roperable records, the web, or email. Alternatively, fax or sending a paper copy with the beneficiary has also been used successfully. 5. Health Outcome and Quality Assessment Several domains can be identified in which baseline data and longitudinal follow-up are important for monitoring outcome and quality of different PAC settings. Functional outcomes are the most widely applicable and complex domains for PAC. In this report, we discuss four major domains of function including physical mobility, ADLs/personal care, IADLs/advanced cognitive activities, and social functioning. For monitoring outco mes in each of these domains, we require metrics that can accommodate the fu ll spectrum of patients at baseline and are sensitive to changes in these metr ics across this spectrum of patients as they improve or decline. Item Response Theory (IRT) and Computer Adaptive Technology (CAT) are well developed methods for minimizing the number of items that n eed to be asked of a given respondent, while mapping all of these items to the same metric (see Chapter 5). For mobility, for example, there may be 50 items in the item pool, but based on each answer, the respondent is directed to an appropriate question, and inappr opriate and unnecessary questi ons are never asked. So a respondent who cannot transfer ou t of bed is never asked questi ons about walking a block and the person who is able to walk a mile is never asked questions about whether he or she can move around in bed. This dramatically reduces the bu rden of the instrument, maps all items on the same metric regardless of where an individual falls on the scale, and is most sensitive to change for each individual because questions are targeted in the area where he or she falls on the scale. Another advantage is that new items can be a dded and tested, and items can be refined while retaining the same metric. These methods are not only developed for applica tions such as national educational testing, but have been used for functional measurement and shown to meet these objectives. The Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC), a func tional status measure de veloped by researchers at Boston University over the last six years, is currently in use by providers such as HealthSouth, Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, and used for measurement in trials by Merck. Other provider entities such as Senior Metrix are considering using th is metric if it can be mapped adequately to the FIM. Collection of informa tion using this methodology is optimized with the use of a PC or web application in which all the logic is programmed. Tes ting has also suggested that patient response measures (in which a pr oxy is used if the patient cannot respond) are reliable when using these methods for functional assessment. The SF36 and the HOS as well as Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 125 numerous other tools have relied on patient response in order to obtain truly patient-centered measures of outcome. A final consideration of health outcome assessme nt is the need for collection of these uniform data at fixed intervals regardless of the ad mission and discharge patt ern among the individual PAC providers. PAC episodes frequently involve multiple providers with relatively short stays in each provider, making it necessary to assess outcomes using a fixed interval following hospital discharge regardless of location. These outcome measures therefore would not replace outcome monitoring within settings conducted by i ndividual facilities for th e purposes of clinical assessment and quality improvement, but will al low comparison across different types of PAC episodes. The appropriate body to oversee longitudi nal data collection for PAC is not clear, but just as NCQA serves this function for the Me dicare HOS data, a central agency could be responsible. B. RECOMMENDED DOMAINS The purpose of this section is to provide in itial recommendations on domains for a uniform assessment instrument that serves the three purposes previously discussed. The three purposes of discharge placement, care transitions, and m onitoring outcomes/quality do not necessarily require the same set of information, but the unif orm assessment instrument must include domains that are necessary for any one of these purposes. Potential measures and measurement issues fo r these domains have been discussed throughout the report. In this section, we do not recommend specific measures because agreement on the set of domains is an essential first step. However, key measurement issues for the different domains are highlighted in the text. This enumeration of domains is based on the literature and previous consensus activities in these areas that were uncovered during this 10-week project. The evidence base, however, is not sufficient to defend each of these domains based on research, nor is it sufficient to exclude all other possible domains. Thus, this should be seen as a recommendation that would benefit from more widespread confirmation. Table 6.1 provides an enumeration of the recomm ended domains, indicating which of the three purposes for which they will be used and a recommended respondent for each domain. Respondents are categorized either as \"P\" denotin g the patient or a proxy for the patient (which may be a family member or other caregiver who is involved with the daily care of an individual), or \"H\" denoting the item could be populated by a hospital databa se or by a hospital staff person from their records. The assumption is that the information will be completed in the hospital as near to hospital discharge as possible, with th e exception of the outcome/quality measures that would also be completed at fixed intervals in addition to baseline. The justification for each domain is summarized below Table 6.1 based on th e information contained in this report. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 126 Table 6.1: Recommended Domains for the Three Purposes of the Uniform Assessment Instrument Domains Discharge Placement Care Transitions Outcomes/ Quality Respondent* Goals of care X X P Specialized rehab care needs X H Patient's residence & with whom X X P Meets Medicare criteria for homebound X H Active problem list X X H Medication list X X H Allergies/intolerances X H Resuscitation status/advance directive/DPAHC X P Discharge instructions/outstanding diagnostic tests X H Cognitive functional status X X P Physical functioning/mobility X X X P Activities of Daily Living/self-care X X X P IADLs/Advanced cognitive X X X P Social functioning X X P Premorbid Function X X P Self-rated health status X X P Pain status X P Depression X X P Skin integrity X H Sensory deficits X X P Dietary needs X H Continence X X P Fall risk X H Services receiving in home X X H DME receiving/equipment X X P, H Able and willing caregiver X X P Ethnic or cultural considerations/language X X P Immunizations and most recent PPD test result X H Infectious precautions X H Insurance/financial resources X X P Basic demographics; age, gender X X H *P= Patient/Proxy; H=Populated by ho spital database or hospital staff Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 127 1. Goals of Care: The patient's goals of care, wh ich should be clarified wi th the assistance of hospital staff, are required for appropriate di scharge placement and to prepare the receiving provider for expectations. Goals may include, but are not limited to, rehabilitation, skilled nursing, prevention of adverse events such as ho spitalization, palliation or end of life care, and stabilization of certain conditions. More than one goal may be appropriate. 2. Specialized Care Needs: An enumeration of specialized care n eeds is necessary in determining the appropriate di scharge location, including services such as PT, OT, ST, oxygen, tracheostomy care, ventilators, ostomy car e, tube feeding, IV infusions, dialysis, wound care, etc. These needs can factor heavily into determ inations of appropriate PAC placement and care as discussed in Chapter 2. 3. Patient's Residence and With Whom: For discharge placement decisions, the patient's place of residence just prior to the hospitalization is critical information. A long-term nursing home resident will more than likely re turn to the nursing home even following a period of PAC; therefore, PAC services must be oriented toward return to the nursing home (which in fact might mean using a rehabi litation program in the same nursing home in which the resident had been residing in order to minimize the number of transitions). In addition to discharge placement, many studies have used the outcome of residential location as an indicator of rehabilitation effectiven ess. Although a gross i ndicator of functional recovery, return to a comparable setting enhances quality of life, particularly for individuals previously residing in the community. 4. Meets Medicare Criteria for Homebound: Me eting the Medicare homebound criteria is necessary for discharge to a HHA and thus cons titutes essential information for discharge placement. According to Medicare, the crite ria include normal inability to leave home except with considerable and taxing effort, and absences from home are infrequent or of relatively short duration or are attributable to receiving medi cal treatment. Individuals meeting the homebound criteria are not re quired to receive PAC in an HHA. 5. Active Problem List: An active problem list, including a patient's current diagnoses and health care problems, is necessary information for receiving providers and to determine the setting to which the patient should be discharged . Most of this information can be obtained directly from the hospital record, but uniformity is required as discussed in Chapter 2. 6. Medication List: As discussed in Chapter 4, miscommunication about medications lead to care transition failures, resulting in rehospi talizations and other misadventures. Thus, accurate medication lists including dosages a nd administration should be included in the uniform assessment, which could potentially be populated from the hospital database. To the extent possible, the medication list should be reconciled with the admitting medications, indicating whether the medications are new or have been suspended, and/or any altered medication dosages or instructions. 7. Allergies/Intolerances: Similar to medicat ions, allergies and in tolerances should be recorded to ensure such information is ava ilable to receiving provi ders. Although providers Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 128 will typically ask the same questions, this critical information may be available only in records for individuals who are cognitively impaired. 8. Resuscitation Status/Advance Directive/Dura ble Power of Attorney for Health Care: Although this information will most likely be co nfirmed at the receiving site, the hospital information on resuscitation and advanced directiv es should be included. If the patient has advance directives or durable power of attorney for health care, the receiving provider can rely on that information if the person is c ognitively impaired or unable to communicate. 9. Discharge Instructions/Follow-Up/Diagnostic Tests and Appointments: Clear discharge instructions and scheduled follow-up diagnosti c tests and appointments are necessary for any Medicare beneficiary leaving the hospital. Otherwise, there is serious risk that he/she will encounter problems followi ng hospitalization, may not know who to contact, and may soon end up back at the hospital or emergency department. 10. Cognitive Functional Status: For placement decision-making and to prepare the receiving provider, a specific measure of cognitive function is importa nt (Chapter 3). Of most importance is that the measure covers the sp ectrum of cognitive functioning that Medicare beneficiaries being discharged from the hospi tal might experience, while the precision of the estimate may be less critical at this stage (except at certain key decision points). For example, placement in an IRF depends on individuals being able to follow fairly complex instructions, such as two-step commands; ot herwise, motor learning will be difficult. 11. Physical Functioning/Mobility: This domain includes the full spectrum of mobility from moving in bed to walking several miles. This is critical to placement and care transitions as seen in Chapter 4 and an essential outcome me asure as seen in Chapter 5. Both covering the spectrum and a reasonable degree of precision in this measurement are necessary in order to use the measure for outcome monitoring. 12. Activities of Daily Living/Self-Care: This domain includes the basic activities of at least toileting, dressing, bathing, pe rsonal hygiene, and eating. Be cause these activities are required daily for personal care, the informa tion is essential for discharge placement, to prepare receiving providers, and as an importa nt outcome domain distinct from physical functioning/mobility. One problem is that whil e most beneficiaries being discharged from the hospital may be independent in all of these activities, the scale needs to be very sensitive to small differences for those who are dependent because such differences can have a strong impact on where these beneficiaries can reside. 13. IADL/Advanced Cognitive Function: This domain includes a wide array of activities required to live in the community including such tasks as housekeeping, transportation, managing money, shopping, taking medications, us ing the telephone, and various aspects of communication. While different items have been included in this domain by different authors, the general construct is recognized as distinct from the more basic personal care activities. These activities al l require levels of both cognitiv e and often physical abilities that are more complex. Once again, this sc ale must be sensitive to gradations of Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 129 measurement across the entire scale because individuals may range from being extremely independent in all of these activities to bei ng virtually unable to accomplish any of them. 14. Social Functioning: Several st udies show that social function ing, including participation in recreational activities and inter action with others, is importa nt for discharge planning and placement. This functional domain is less well developed than the others that have been measured over many decades in PAC and long-term care. However, recent studies suggest the importance of social/role functioning as a marker for quality of life outcomes. 15. Premorbid Function: Functional status prior to the hospital event has been found in several studies to be an important consideration in di scharge placement. A patient's recovery is clearly limited by his or her func tion prior to an acute event, which needs to be considered in the context of goals and prognosis. 16. Self-Rated Health Status: Self-perceived health status provides a global measure for providers about a patient's quality of life. Poorly rated health status is associated with high utilization of health care serv ices, which should alert provider s to individuals who are most vulnerable during care transitions. As an outco me measure, self-rated health status is an important domain that should benefit from effective PAC. 17. Pain Status: Pain has been called the fifth vita l sign because it is so important to a patient's health and wellbeing, and it is treatable. Severa l measures exist for pa in (Chapter 3), and hospitals focus on it increasingly. Thus, a rating of pain status and a plan for pain control are necessary at care transition. 18. Depression: A depression scr een is important to detect th e potential for depression that would then require further eval uation and treatment following discharge. As discussed in Chapter 3, without a screen, depression is under -reported, which can seriously hamper care. 19. Skin Integrity: Frequently a patient is discharged to a PAC setting with skin problems such as pressure sores, stasis ulcers, surgical w ounds, or abrasions. Because it is essential to begin monitoring and managing skin problems within hours of admission to a PAC setting, including an assessment of skin is necessary for care transitions. 20. Sensory Deficits: Receiving providers can be nefit immensely from information gleaned in the hospital through testing visual, hearing, and other sensory deficits. These deficits are typically thoroughly evaluated in the hospital and are important to consider in making placement decisions and preparing receiving pr oviders to avoid unsuccessful transitions. 21. Dietary Needs: To the extent that the hospital has assessed an individual's nutrition and dietary needs, this information should be made available to the receiving provider. This is particularly important if dietary needs have changed as a result of the hospitalization and a patient may not fully understand the implications of the new diet. 22. Continence: Urinary or bowel incontinence may mean the difference between whether an individual can receive PAC in the home or in a nursing home, depending upon the Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 130 availability of assistance. Fu rthermore, receiving providers s hould not have to discover past problems with continence because new continence problems may arise due to the stress of the transition or some other factors. 23. Fall Risk: A simple assessment of fall risk could prevent a major fa ll and fracture in the period immediately after care transition b ecause the receiving environment is not appropriately fall proof. Whether this is a di scharge to home or to a facility, knowledge of fall risk may decrease an untoward event. 24. Services Receiving in the Home : Whether a patient has any pa id help in the home or is receiving volunteer services could affect discharge placement. However, proper communication is necessary during the care transition in order to assure that these services are available and are still appropriate and su fficient given the indi vidual's new status. 25. Durable Medical Equipment (DME)/Equipmen t: Both previous and newly ordered DME needs to be specified. This could influence discharge placement and is necessary in the care transition. DME such as special beds and mattresses, ambulation equipment (e.g., trapeze, walker, cane, wheel chair), or specialized eq uipment for ADLs will be necessary as soon as an individual arrives at a PAC setting. 26. Able and Willing Caregiver: Availability of an able and willing caregiver has been found to strongly predict PAC placement and can most certainly make a difference as to whether an individual can go home initially or even over the long run if the disa bility is likely to persist. Both whether the caregiver is able to provi de the necessary assistance and whether the caregiver is willing must be assessed based on a patient's condition. Because patients have a range of needs and caregivers have a range of abilities, this domain must capture a broad spectrum of circumstances. 27. Ethnic or Cultural Considerations/Language: Fr equently, cultural differences will alter the likelihood that family will be interested in car ing for a chronically ill or dying person in the home. Language issues should al so be taken into considerat ion in planning discharge and assuring that care transitions are successful . Communication and cultural understanding may be key to the success of PAC. 28. Immunizations and PPD Test: The hospital di scharge provides one more point of care to assure that the appropriate immunizations and a PPD test have been completed. 29. Infectious Precautions: For immune compromised patients, or patients with contagious or high-risk infections, precautions must be known and considered in discharge placement. 30. Insurance/Financial Resources: A patient's financial resources need to be taken into consideration even when Medicare is th e primary payor because of co-payments, coinsurance, and the fact that some services or options may not be covered by Medicare. At very least, patients need to be aware of the costs of different alternatives. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 131 31. Basic Demographics - Age, Gender: Age and gender are necessary both to consider placement from the perspective of a patient's capacity for intensive rehabilitation and to recover and live independently. They are also important identifiers in the care transition. C. LONG-TERM VISION AND RECOMMENDATIONS The long-term recommendations are intended to provide a vision for assessment across PAC settings that could be achieva ble over the next five to ten years depending upon commitment to such a strategy. The reason for providing this long-term vision is that any short-term recommendations should feed into a longer-term plan or we risk continuing to develop setting- specific assessments along paths that will neve r meet. Many details of this long-term recommendation have not been refined, but the vision is what is important. 1. Core Dataset Completed at Every Hospital Discharge A core dataset with the necessary domains for placement decisions, transitions, baseline outcome assessment, and ultimately payment for epis odes of PAC should be completed for every Medicare beneficiary upon hospita l discharge. Questions for al l domains would be embedded in a uniform instrument completed on an automated pl atform. Current measurement strategies such as IRT/CAT should be used in order to mini mize respondent burden while maximizing precision of measurement for each beneficiary. While th ese methodologies are not applicable to all domains, particularly those not generally a ssessed on a continuum (e.g., place of residence, medications, care plans, etc), they should be used for relevant domains that can be scaled on an underlying metric (e.g., physical f unction, and social function). Items would consist of both provider response and patient/proxy interview to assure patient centeredness. Provider-report information would be populated to the extent possible from existing hospital systems using standardized vocabularies, minimizi ng burden and data entry error. The product generated from the assessment w ould be a summary repo rt (electronic and hardcopy) providing information such as the medi cation list, advance directives, allergies, and the metrics for the functional items and othe r scales for domains such as cognition and depression. The scores could ul timately be converted to pe rcentiles for the population of discharges, which would be more meaningful to users who are unfam iliar with each specific metric. Thus, the uniform assessment would be distilled to a summary report (probably one page) without inclusion of responses to each and every item that were asked of the individual beneficiary. 2. Algorithms Developed for R ecommended Patient Placement Based on research using the core database, norms fo r characteristics of patients treated most cost effectively in the different setti ngs could be determined. To the extent possible, algorithms or data-driven recommendations on placement based on these norms could be generated from the dataset. Placement decision guidance could be ov erridden based on unique characteristics of the beneficiary, the community, the caregiver, or bed availability as appropriate. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 132 3. Uniform Assessment Would Be Transmitted Electronically to Receiving Providers The summary obtained from the assessment conduc ted at hospital discharge with all the key information would be transmitted directly to th e receiving provider, pref erably through access to a protected website. Alternatively, email or even use of interopera ble records would be possible. The transmitted information would assure contin uity of care from the hos pital without replacing an assessment conducted by the site for clinical pu rposes. However, the core dataset could feed directly into standard assessment tools used by each type of PAC setting so that patients would continue to be monitored on the same set of metr ics. For IRT-based metrics, greater precision in the scoring of individuals using these metrics would be possible at sites by the use of more questions from the item pool to refine the individu al score. This would enable providers to detect smaller but significant changes in some of these metrics as part of care activities and quality improvement. The other domains for an y federally-mandated standard PAC assessment would not be duplicative of thos e in this uniform assessment tool, but would build upon it in areas pertinent to specific PAC providers. 4. Health and Outcome Monitoring System The hospital discharge assessment would provide ba seline data for longitudinal follow-up of key functional outcomes, quality of life, residence, and utilization. This information would be collected at fixed intervals rega rdless of PAC settings and leng ths of stay. These longitudinal outcome data would be utilized in a database to determine expected outcomes for comparable patients across settings in order to make future policy decisi ons about appropriate coverage. 5. Payment Would be Based on Similar Met rics Regardless of Discharge Setting One option would be to use data generated from the uniform a ssessment and longitudinal cost measurement to develop payment models for tota l episodes of PAC. These could be used to make per episode payments that covered the enti re multi-provider episode rather than setting- specific payments. This strategy would encourag e the use of cost-effective settings and avoid the incentive to shorten stays and discharge to subsequent providers, resulting in more multiple- provider episodes. Alternatively, use of the same metrics for functional st atus would be possible in each setting-specific payment system in order to equate patient groups. Thus, setting-specific payment systems could be developed based on similar items. D. SHORT-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS The following set of recommendations provides a possible road map for de veloping and testing a uniform assessment instrument that could then be implemented for national demonstration activities. These recommendations assume that the project would build upon the findings of this report with a CMS endorsement such that an exte nsive national vetting of all decisions would not be required through town meetings and national c onsensus activities. Obviously, any assessment instrument would need to be sufficiently defensib le to withstand critique , but engagement of all parties in the development w ould likely derail efforts to pr oduce an instrument focused on specific purposes that minimizes bur den to providers and patients. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 133 1. Review of Recommended Domains fo r Uniform Assessment Instrument A group of technical experts with expertise in all assessment sett ings, the Medicare program, and research should review the set of domains propos ed in this report for the three purposes. The technical expert panel should be sent this report along with a table similar to Table 6.1 that includes literature citations and a definition fo r each domain. Panel members should be asked to rate each domain in terms of relative importan ce prior to the meeting; the ratings should be compiled and then discussed at the meeting. Other possible domains s hould be discussed as well. Although one should expect topics such as specific measures and measurement strategies to arise during the discussion, the focus of this activity should be on the domains. We have found that consensus on domains when the purpose and population is clear is not that difficult to achieve among unbiased experts . 2. Testing Functional Measurement Using IRT/CAT Using the AM-PAC platform developed by Boston University researchers, a test could be conducted using specified IRT-based functional domains and any relativ ely straightforward items pertaining to identified non-IRT-based do mains (e.g., demographics, advanced directives, diagnoses). The intent of the testing would be to have some users begin to collect hospital discharge data related to func tion and make it available to re ceiving providers. The item pool developed for the IRT could be enhanced as n eeded to meet the needs of the acute hospital discharge population. Preliminar y data could help generate no rms for different PAC providers. 3. Identify or Develop Measures for Each Domain To the extent that tested measures exist, thes e should be identified for each domain and rated in terms of the extent to which they cover the PAC spectrum, validity, reliability, and burden. A combination of provider- and patient-response questions should be ut ilized depending upon the nature of the domain. Provider response inform ation pertaining to medi cations, ICD-9 codes and allergies, for example, should be structured us ing standardized vocabularies, increasing the likelihood that such fields can be populated dire ctly from electronic health records and can be transported into records at the receiving provider. Patient res ponse items should be worded as they would be asked of patients, and algorithms fo r selecting proxies should be included in the instrument logic. Cross-walking to exis ting CMS PAC assessment tools and the VA GEC Referral Form should be considered in item selection. Although an attempt should be made to use measur es and items from existing tools that have been tested and meet criteria for validity and re liability, when no such instrument exists that applies directly to this purpose, modest devel opmental efforts will be necessary. These efforts should begin by review and recommenda tion of experts in that specif ic domain in order to take advantage of what is currently in use and under development, but may not be published. Targeted testing on small samples to refine que stions and metrics should then be completed before incorporating into the larger instrument. Screening questions and skip patterns should be considered to reduce respondent burden when ite ms do not apply. Because the instrument will initially be set up as an automated tool, items can be tested and refined as development proceeds. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 134 4. Automate the Tool For administering, maintaining, and transmitti ng a uniform assessment instrument, a web application is the ideal approach. A website can be accessed with sufficient firewalls for security purposes by the hospital staff person completing the assessment, who would enter information and would be led through an in terview by the application involving specific questions for the patient. Range checks can be included in the software, no data entry is necessary, and the information could be entered at different times if at one point the resident interview was completed and at another point the provider information was co mpleted or uploaded. The web- based application would generally be easy to access from any PC on the Internet and would be easy to update without disseminating new software to individual locations. However, a PC- based version of the tool and logi c could readily be developed as well, the results of which could be uploaded or transmitted. The assessment information could be retrieved vi a the website by receiving providers who have system access. The information could also be emailed or downloaded by the site, as appropriate. Although electronic transmission always raises c oncerns about security, the system could be completely HIPAA compliant and through encoding th e data stream could be completely secure (as in banking). The issues do not arise with secu rity of the data stream; rather, they relate to restricting user access and a voiding inadvertent sharing of access codes and passwords. Other hardware/software platforms currently under development or availa ble to CMS should also be explored. 5. Beta Testing Testing in a sample of hospitals for a range of Medicare PAC be neficiaries would be necessary for refining questions and the me trics and item pools for functi onal domains. A balance between precision and burden would have to be determined in all domain s. Software and the technology would be refined through this te sting. This beta testing would also give initial norms for the various metrics that could prove useful for demons tration design. It could be relatively simple to enroll a large number of patients very fast in this type of test because it could be used for any Medicare beneficiary discharged from the hospital. An import ant policy question, however, is the incentive for hospitals to complete such a form as part of the testing. Without some type of incentive it will be difficult to motivate discharge pl anners or other hospital staff to complete the tool. As part of the testing, longitudi nal follow-up at fixed intervals fo r the portion of the instrument that would be used for outcome monitoring s hould be conducted. Presumably this follow-up would be by telephone with the beneficiary or caregiver, but telephone follow-up could be compared with in-person follow-up during this in itial test. The differe nce between proxy and patient responses to items should also be tested during this period in or der to understand biases that might occur for any of the outcome items. This outcome follow-up should be conducted at several intervals to determine the most appropri ate intervals for different types of PAC. Division of Health Care Policy and Research, UCDHSC, Aurora, CO 135 6. National Demonstration Following pilot testing and refinement, a nati onal demonstration coul d then be conducted, yielding a large database of uniform assessments and longitudinal data. The information could be used to: 1) compare patients discharged to different types of settings or multiple-provider episodes and determine the extent to which there is substitution; 2) compare costs for comparable patients across different episodes of care; 3) develop placement al gorithms for clinician guidance and determining the most appropriate post-acute care settings; and 4) assess the effects of the transmitted uniform assessment instrument on car e transitions. Ultimately, such information would prove useful for working toward a more sa fe, cost-effective, patient-centered system of PAC for Medicare beneficiaries. "}
