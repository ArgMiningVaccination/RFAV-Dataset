Broken Spirits and The Healing Path 2. Depression, Anxiety, Suicide Ideation, Substance Abuse...And Enduring Well 3. Trauma 4. Recovery 5. Healing 6. Hope for Families 7. Gratitude and Enduring Well \"Authors welcome the healer into a foundationally spiritual understanding of deep trauma and its treatment. Soon it becomes evident that underneath moral injury, trauma often causes a deeper spiritual injury. In this way, trauma becomes a gateway to galvanize a \"hard-wired\" road to spiritual awakening and growth. Here, growth is a state of peace and satisfaction. This is a growth that is fueled in tandem, concomitantly, with emotional pain. Psychotherapy for authors Bigfoot and Kelley no longer aim simply for recovery back to baseline or exclusively symptom relief, but rather a form of Post Traumatic Spiritual Growth (PTSG), a scientifically supported pathway to renewal. Clinical steps and methods can readily be used by an experienced clinician or an emerging therapist in training. This book, based upon decades of clinical experience, is a jewel to lay down treatments in support of PTSG and the \"new normal\" in trauma work.\" Lisa Miller, Ph.D., professor and founder, Spirituality Mind Body Institute, Columbia University, and author, New York Times Bestseller, The Spiritual Child and The Awakened Brain.
