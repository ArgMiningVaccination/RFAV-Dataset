Before joining MPM, Dr. Doyle spent 15 years caring for primary care patients with an integrative approach at Allina Health.

Curious about the interplay of genes and health, Dr. Doyle completed her undergraduate thesis at Yale University with laboratory research on cancer causing genes and graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in biology.

A life-long learner, Dr. Doyle joined the Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine's inaugural fellowship class, and graduated with honors and an elective focus in epigenetics. She appreciated the fellowship's inter-professional approach, and was able to expand her knowledge of healing arts to bring a larger skill set to her patient care. Caring for others is intrinsic to Dr. Doyle, and in addition to her medical practice, she pursues this through multiple community service commitments. She was the founding Board Chair at Arete Academy, a school focused on wholistic education for bright K-12 students with learning differences, and she regularly volunteers with Yale College and the Blake School. Outside of work, Dr. Doyle loves to focus on her family and friends. She enjoys reading, walking, cooking, puzzles, games and gatherings. Her husband, three children and Boston Terrier keep her busy and filled with gratitude and joy. My experience has been excellent.

My health is improving! Dr. Doyle has also referred me to some great resources and I have learned a lot!

[\u00d7] Denise MiThunborg Clinical Operations Specialist Denise enjoys working with patients and their loved ones. Denise worked in senior care after leaving the information technology (IT) field in 1991. It was a leap of faith that led her to a part-time job in the business office of a nursing home in order to be home more. She then transferred to a sister nursing home that also had a group home attached. As roles changed in the business office, Denise found she had less time to spend with the residents, so she made the decision to become certified as an Activity Director. It was hard work planning activities for the residents, but she found the work incredibly rewarding. She was on the board of \"Let's Go Fishing\" program and helped raise funds to purchase a pontoon for the elderly and veterans in Otter Tail County. She saw the enormous benefit of getting her residents out on the lakes. As the years passed, Denise was able to bring technology to the residents. As many families are spread out, she assisted the residents with connecting with their loved ones through FaceTime or Skype. She also pioneered bringing the Music & Memory Program to the residents. Several years ago, Denise remarried and relocated to the Twin Cities area where her healthcare journey took her to working in an occupational and urgent care clinic. That experience led her to MPM. Denise is excited to continue her work at a place that truly cares about their patients. Denise loves spending time with friends and family, especially the grandkids. She and her husband are enjoying new adventures in \"glamping\" with their rescue dogs. [\u00d7] Cary Marie Pizzo Scheduling Lead Cary Marie thrives on being helpful to others.
