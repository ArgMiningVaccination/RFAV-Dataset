Consumers certainly seem convinced of this; at least they are demanding more information about the products they buy. And FDA is responding to this demand with a variety of actions, among them recently issued regulations that will require ingredient labeling on alcoholic beverages and cosmetics, and plans for a forthcoming proposal to require that purchasers of hearing aids be informed of the performance characteristics of these devices and the limitations of their potential benets. Purchasers of over-the-counter drugs can nd out from the label what these products contain, what they can be ex pected to do, and what side effects might result from taking them. Prescription medicines are another matter. The only thing patients are told about them, by and large, is what the physician tells them and what the physician instructs the pharmacist to put on the label. The theory is that the physician will tell the patient all he or she needs to know. But sometimes the message doesn't get through, and on occasion it isn't even sent. Informing Patients on Prescrip tion Drugs is one of the subjects we examine this month. Price, of course, is an important consideration in virtu ally any purchase. Some States permit pharmacies to ad vertise the price of prescription drugs, while others prohibit it. But even where they are permitted, these ads aren't much help to the consumer in comparing prices if they omit such basic information as the brand name, dosage strength, and dosage form of the advertised drug. This information, and more, is now required under a new FDA regulation on What Drug Price Ads Must Tell. With the vast number of medicines now available, it would be impossible to list on the label of drugs all the signicant ways they might interact with other drugs. FDA requires labeling information on certain drug interactions, but the subject is too broad, too complex\u2014and in some in stances insufficiently understood\u2014to be covered fully in written instructions to patients. Consumers should be aware, however, that mixing medicines can be a dangerous practice\u2014and that goes for over-the-counter as well as prescription medicines.

Notices of Judgment 28 Cover Design: Robert Lovelace 2 / March 1976 / FDA ConsumerConsumer Forum A Question of Timing While we certainly have no quarrel with your printing an article which recites the chronology and rationale for FDA action on polyvinyl chloride, we strongly question the timing and content of Polyvinyl Chloride: Why FDA Acted which appeared in the December/January issue of FDA Consumer. Should the ofcial magazine of FDA publish an article on the vinyl chloride regulations prior to the completion of that process? We think not. In fact, we believe that the published article could suggest that FDA has prejudged the case and decided to ban several important types of polyvinyl chloride packaging prior to reviewing new industry data which shows that these products present no hazard to public health. We also nd it difcult to understand why author Wayne Pines' otherwise excellent chronology fails to mention: Commissioner Schmidt's finding that polyvinyl chloride packaging presents no immediate hazard. The December 19 filing of 900 pages of comment by The Society of the Plastics Industry documenting industry's contention that there is no reasonable expectation of vinyl chloride monomer migration from any polyvinyl chloride product. The December 19 recommendation of the Ofce of Wage and Price Stabilization urging FDA to delay its polyvinyl chloride regulations until it has evaluated more current data on the presence of polyvinyl chloride in food. Since the article states that \"December 12\" was the nal date for ling comments on the FDA proposal, we believe it was written substantially ahead of important new factual developments in the chronology of this regulation. Therefore, we believe that FDA Consumer will want to set the record straight with an article that presents all the facts in the vinyl chloride regulation, including industry's arguments as well as the nal action by the Agency. Jerome H. Heckman General Counsel The Society of the Plastics Industry Washington, D.C. FDA Consumer often carries articles on pro posed regulations because consumers should knowwhat regulatory actions FDA is'considering, and why. Publication of the article on polyvinyl chloride in no way indicates FDA has prejudged the case. FDA will carefully review all the comments sub mitted on the proposal and make its judgment on the basis of the evidence. When nal action is taken, it will be reported in FDA Consumer. The FDA Consumer article did point out that the public health hazard from polyvinyl chloride food packaging material was not of a nature that warranted either an immediate ban on use of the material or recall of food products packaged in it. The comments on FDA's proposal led by the Society of the Plastics Industry and the recommen dation of the Ofce of Wage and Price Stabilization occurred substantially after the FDA Consumer article was written and prepared for publication. Not Polyvinyl Chloride The December 75-January 76 issue of the FDA Consumer contained an article on polyvinyl chlo ride, accompanied by a picture of several containers which the article stated \"may be\" made from poly vinyl chloride. While no labels were visible in the picture, one of the containers was, nevertheless, readily identiable as our RJR Foods Vermont Maid Syrup, because the distinctive container, made from private molds, is only available to us. RJR Foods adopted the plastic container for syrup several years ago as a convenience to the consumer because of its light weight and freedom from hazard of glass breakage. Since \"may be\" was included in the caption along side the picture and since we do not want consumers to be misled, we wish to state for the record that this package does not contain polyvinyl chloride nor has it ever.

FDA Consumer / March 1976 / 3Informing Patients On Prescription Drugs Consumers should be informed about the medicines they take\u2014what the drugs will do and what side effects might occur. There's little dispute about that. But what's the best method of making this information available? Patient package inserts is one way, and FDA has a special project devoted to nding out what kind of information such inserts should include, what drugs they should be used with, and how much they would benet patients. by Annabel Hecht T w o h u n d r e d y e a r s a g o t h e r e w e r eonly a handful of medicines\u2014few o f t h e m e ff e c t i v e \u2014 t o c u r e t h e i l l s of colonial Americans. Today, some 22,000 prescription drugs are available for which the Nation's physicians write 1.5 billion prescriptions a year. How much do the patients who take these medicines know about them? Does the physician hand them that important slip of paper with nothing more than a friendly pat on the back and the fatherly advice that the prescribed drug will \"make you feel better\"? Or does he take some time to explain what the medicine should do and what side effects might be expected? And if so, how much of this information is under stood and remembered by the patient who might be in pain, anxious, con fused\u2014or simply not attentive? The Food and Drug Administration believes that consumers have a right to k n o w b o t h t h e b e n e t s a n d r i s k s i n volved in the drugs they take. \"FDA's long-standing policy is that consumers should be aware of the potential side effects of prescription drugs,\" Alexander M. Schmidt, M.D., Commissioner of Food and Drugs, has said. Just how to convey this information to the con sumer is both a matter of concern and a responsibility of the FDA. The Agen cy not only is charged with assuring the safety and effectiveness of all drugs sold in the United States, but has the authority to specify the kind of infor mation that must appear on drug pack age labels and on package inserts. Package inserts usually are small leaf lets or folders that accompany drug products. Package inserts for prescrip tion drugs usually are written for physi cians and pharmacists. Nonprescription drugs pose few problems since they come prepackaged with a label which contains certain re quired information about ingredients, intended uses, and warnings. Prescrip tion drugs, on the other hand, are dis pensed in varying quantities, according to the patient's needs, in containers provided by the pharmacist. The phar macist, in turn, attaches a label which generally carries little information about the drug except its name, strength, and when and how to take it. In most cases, only the physician and the pharmacist know whether a partic ular drug has potential for harm. And unless one or the other forewarns the patient, he may not know that he is courting danger if he drives after tak ing a drug which contains an antihista mine or that he may have serious reac tions if he takes certain combinations of drugs at the same time. One way to assure that patients get all the information they need, FDA believes, is through \"patient package inserts\"\u2014printed material written specically for the patient in easily under stood, nontechnical language. This is not a new or revolutionary concept. Many physicians have used written instruction sheets to give their patients information about their medi cation, diets, or treatment programs. FDA, however, initiated the idea of an ofcial patient package insert in 1970 when it required such labeling for birth control pills (oral contracep tives). 'The pill\" was considered ap propriate for patient labeling because it is used over long periods of time by healthy women who should be aware of and watch for adverse reactions. Early last year patient labeling also was established for injectable contracep tives and for diethylstilbestrol (DES), which is now approved by FDA for use only as a \"morning after\" contra ceptive in emergency situations such as rape. Except for a special warning re quired on containers of an aerosolized asthma drug, patient information is not required for any other prescription drug at this time. Two medical devices, however, may have such patient label ing in the near future: intrauterine de vices (lUDs) and hearing aids. Pro posed labeling for lUDs is designed to assure that women who use them have been fully informed of the advan tages and disadvantages of the device and that they are made aware of al ternative means of contraception. Pro posed labeling for hearing aids is be ing drafted by FDA. In addition, FDA's Obstetrics and Gynecology Advisory Committee has recommended that a patient package insert be required for estrogens used 4 / March 1976 / FDA ConsumerF D A w a n t s t o k n o w m u c h m o r e a b o u t the kind of information patients need, both in terms of what patients themselves say they want and what physicians believe is appropriate for them to have. to alleviate symptoms of menopause. Should patient package inserts be required for the full range of prescrip tion drugs, or only a few? Before making that decision, FDA wants to know much more about the kind of information patients need, both in terms of what patients themselves say they want and what physicians believe is appropriate for them to have. An other area that needs to be explored is how to communicate this informa tion to the patient. How can sophisti cated and technical information be conveyed to large numbers of people who have varying backgrounds and dif ferent levels of education? Who should present the material\u2014the physician or pharmacist? Should it be attached to the drug container? And nally, FDA wants to know how this information will affect the patient's behavior when it comes to following a treatment pro gram. To nd the answers to these ques tions FDA has established the Patient Prescription Drug Labeling Project within the Bureau of Drugs. The proj ect staff already has sought the opin ions of many people, those who are interested in or would be affected by a patient labeling program, by hold ing discussions with consumer groups, medical associations, and pharmaceu tical trade and professional organiza tions. At the same time, an on-going re search program is providing much rst hand evidence on how patient package inserts can be used. Already completed is an FDA-sponsored survey of users of oral contraceptives which was un dertaken to nd out what consumerswant to know and how they use the information provided on package in serts. The nationwide survey was con ducted among 1,720 current users and 949 former users of oral contraceptives. FDA found that consumers do get the inserts, and that most read them and nd the information useful. Further more, the study revealed that an over whelming majority of oral contracep tive users believes this same kind of information should be required for tranquilizers, antibiotics, and other prescription drugs, as well as for cough and cold preparations. Side effects are a major concern to users of oral contraceptives, according to the survey. About one of every ten current users of oral contraceptives re ported that the package insert raised questions about \"the pill\" which caused her to discuss the drug with her phys ician. These questions were overwhelm ingly about side effects the women experienced. When the women sur veyed changed brands of pills\u2014and almost half of all current users had changed brands at least once\u2014the pri mary reason was the experience of or fear of side effects. More information on side effects and more details on warnings and precautions is what most of the women surveyed said they want in package inserts for both oral contra ceptives and other prescription drugs. In another move to determine the value of patient inserts, FDA is spon soring a study in several clinics associ ated with hospitals in Los Angeles. The clinics have been selected so experi mental inserts can be tested with pa tients who have varying levels of edu cation. All the patients involved in thestudy are taking one of two drugs pre scribed for high blood pressure, hydro- chlorthiazide or methyldopa. Patients receiving the experimental insert will be matched against a control group re ceiving no such additional information about the drugs they are taking. The purpose of the study is to determine whether the patients understand the information and whether having it makes a difference in their decision to stay in the clinic program. In another study, different texts and levels of in formation will be tested to nd out how detailed and explicit an insert should be. While this research program moves ahead, FDA has been seeking com ments on a petition urging that certain prescription drugs be accompanied by label warnings written for consumers. The petition was led by the Center for Law and Social Policy on behalf of the Consumers Union of the United States, Inc.; Consumer Action for Im proved Food and Drugs; National Or ganization for Women; Women's Equity Action League; and Women's Legal Defense Fund. Patients are not getting enough in formation about the drugs they take, these organizations feel. Their petition contends that many physicians are too rushed and overburdened to take the time to discuss medication with their patients. Many people, particularly those in the inner city, get their medi cal care in crowded, impersonal clinics, the petition says. Thus, they are being deprived of warnings of life and death importance. Another problem cited in the petition is that unused medicines are often passed on from one person 6 / March 1976 / FDA ConsumerUnless the physician or pharmacist forewarns the patient, he may not know he is courting danger if he drives after taking an antihistamine or that he may have serious reactions if he takes certain combinations of drugs. to another, neither of whom may be aware of the potential dangers of this practice. The petition asks FDA to require that when certain drugs are dispensed t h e l a b e l s o n t h e c o n t a i n e r s i n c l u d e warnings about the drug's most serious side effects. The labels would be placed on the containers by the manufacturer or by the pharmacist using labels sup plied by the manufacturer. The petition also asks FDA to consider requiring more detailed information on patient package inserts for these drugs. The petitioners are asking this labeling for those prescription drugs most likely to i n d u c e a d v e r s e s i d e e ff e c t s o r i n t e r a c t i o n s w i t h o t h e r m e d i c a t i o n s o r f o r which verbal warnings to the patients may not be adequate. Singled out are drugs that pose dangers to pregnant or breast-feeding women, such as hyp notics and tranquilizers, and drugs such as amphetamines and chloramphenicol that the petitioners say have been over- prescribed and can have serious side effects. Such warning labels will reinforce, but not supplant, verbal instructions from the physician, the petition indi cates, and thus, will assure safer use of prescription drugs. After extending the closing date once, FDA asked that all comments on the petition be submitted by March 5, 1976. These comments, along with information developed out of the Agen cy's research program, will be used to determine the future course of pre scription drug labeling for patients.

Have AGiie!When different drugs meet inside the human body, they can touch off some unusual reactions. Drugs sometimes are prescribed so they will interact and produce a desired result. But mixing drugs without a physician's advice can produce unexpected and dangerous side effects. by Timothy J. Larkin Although not the denition cited by. scientists, chemistry could be de ned as the science of combining sub stances so that the whole is usually surprisingly different from the sum of its parts. Take a positive ion of the s o f t m e t a l s o d i u m w h i c h c a n b u r n t h e skin or explode when mixed with wa t e r. C o m b i n e t h i s h a z a r d o u s s u b s t a n c e with a negative ion of the poisonous, greenish-yellow gas chlorine. The re sult is not an even more dangerous chemical, but something quite differ ent, the universal seasoning, the white currency with which Roman legion naires were paid\u2014salt.Perhaps even more extraordinary is the end result of combining two atoms of hydrogen gas and one of oxygen. The product, water, possesses proper ties that would have been impossible to predict from the qualities of its constituents. If simple chemical combinations can produce such seemingly unrelated and surprising offspring, it should not be surprising that when two or more dif ferent drugs meet inside the human body some unusual results may occur. The results of some drug interac tions are unimportant. Others, how ever, can mean the difference between successful and unsuccessful treatment; can produce a false reading of a labo ratory test; can cause unexpected and possibly serious\u2014even fatal\u2014side ef fects; or can set off puzzling or mis leading symptoms. Although the FDA requires that the manufacturer of a new drug prove its safety and effectiveness, the drug pro ducer does not routinely carry out, and is not required by law to carry out, tests for safety and effectiveness that 8 / March 1976 / FDA Consumer Photos by Dan O'Toolei n v o l v e s i m u l t a n e o u s u s e o f s e v e r a l drugs. One reason is that the whole problem of drug interactions is still new and incompletely understood. An other is that it is an endlessly compli cated business. Complex, partially understood, but nonetheless important. Fortunately, largely due to the reporting of such interactions by physicians and pharma cists, a number of important facts have become known. As factual knowledge about potentially signicant drug inter actions emerges, the FDA requires that such information be reflected in the label that accompanies nonpre scription (over-the-counter) medicines and the labeling information available to pharmacists and physicians for pre scription drugs. FDA also publishes a widely distributed monthly collection o f d a t a a b o u t i n t e r a c t i o n s a n d o t h e r important effects of drugs. Drugs interact in a number of ways. One drug may make another drug act faster or slower, or more powerfully or less powerfully than it normally would. One drug may change theeffect another drug has on the body. A fairly common way one drug acts on another is by affecting the way it is absorbed, distributed, or broken down (metabolized) by the body. For ex ample, let's assume that you are af flicted with a circulatory problem due to clotting of blood in an artery or vein. Your physician may prescribe an anticoagulant medicine \u2014 a medicine that \"thins\" the blood and thus helps dissolve the clot, ff, at the same time, you are taking an antacid, even a non prescription antacid, the anticoagulant may be absorbed at a slower rate than required to do its job properly. Alcohol and anticoagulants can in teract in two ways, both serious. Chron ic alcohol abuse will speed up the rate by which the liver metabolizes or breaks down the anticoagulant, reduc ing its effect. But drinking a great deal of alcohol in a short period can slow down the metabolism. This can mag nify the impact of the anticoagulant to the point where the blood becomes so thin it may be difcult to halt bleed ing caused by an injury or from an ulcer aggravated by the alcohol. f t s h o u l d b e n o t e d t h a t a n u m b e r o f popular nonprescription cough and cold medicines contain up to 15 per cent alcohol, and that alcohol inter acts not only with anticoagulants but also with a number of other medicines. For example, if a person taking nitro glycerin for angina pectoris, a painful heart ailment, is also drinking alco holic beverages, the result may be hy potension\u2014low blood pressure\u2014seri ous enough to cause a failure of the blood circulatory system. In addition to interfering with ab sorption, distribution, and metabolism, one drug can also either inhibit or hasten the excretion of another, and thus either exaggerate or reduce the effect of the drug. One common way this occurs is through the taking of nonprescription drugs that change the pH or acid level of the urine. Prescrip t i o n m e d i c i n e s a r e f o r m u l a t e d o n t h e basis of a normal level of acid (pH) in the urine. But certain nonprescrip tion drugs (such as those containing ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbo- FDA Consumer / March 1976 / 9nate, or citrates) change the pH, and t h i s c a n i n t e r f e r e w i t h t h e o t h e r w i s e benecial impact of the prescription medicine. For a somewhat more complicated example, should you be taking the oral antidiabetic drug acetohexamide and also take phenylbutazone, which is often prescribed to relieve the pain of arthritis or gout, a breakdown product of the antidiabetic drug will not be excreted at sufcient speed through the kidneys. The result can be a serious and prolonged deciency of blood sugar. When a number of drugs are being taken, consideration must be given to the effect of adding one drug to an other\u2014their cumulative impact. This so-called additive reaction is especially important if the drugs are similar in their general effect. There are some drugs which, when combined, produce reactions that go beyond what one might assume would result from adding the effect of one to the other. With such drugs, the end result is greater than the sum of thetwo parts. This type of action, in which the effects from two drugs are not simply added to each other but are multiplied, is called potentiation. Potentiation can greatly accelerate the helpful effect of a drug, as when the antibiotic trimethoprin may be used to enhance the activity of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole in combating certain infections. But potentiation also can be one of the most dangerous forms of drug interaction, and a number of deaths of otherwise healthy persons have been reported that resulted from potentiation, particularly through mix ing alcohol with sleeping aids, pain relievers, or tranquilizers. Even commonly used nonprescrip tion medicines can have potentiating effects. Aspirin greatly increases the blood-thinning effect of oral anticoagu lants. Therefore, a person who is tak ing such medication may risk hemor rhage if he or she uses aspirin to alleviate a headache. Many nonprescription cold remedies contain antihistamines which can pro duce potentiating effects when takenin conjunction with alcohol or with a wide variety of prescription and other nonprescription drugs, particularly those that act as central nervous sys tem depressants, including anesthetics, barbiturates, hypnotics, sedatives, and analgesics. One important kind of drug reaction does not involve one drug interacting with another in the body to produce an unwanted side effect, but rather a drug affecting the body chemistry in a way t h a t s k e w s o r c o n f u s e s t h e r e s u l t s o f diagnostic tests. Ordinary nonprescrip tion drugs can have this skewing effect and so can vitamins. For example, laboratory tests to determine a patient's c a l c i u m o r b o n e m e t a b o l i s m c a n b e affected by excess use of laxatives. Vi tamins A, D, and K, as well as such common over-the-counter drugs as as pirin, can produce false positive or negative readings in a great number of important tests used by physicians to diagnose illness. And large doses of vitamin C can produce false negative urinary glucose tests which can, there fore, mask a diabetes condition. 10 / March 1976 / FDA ConsumerHow can you protect yourself against a harmful drug interaction? Here are some suggestions: When your physician prescribes a drug for you make sure he knows what other drugs you are taking. All o f t h e m . R e m e m b e r t h a t t h e w o r d s \"drug\" and \"medicine\" mean the same thing, and that alcohol is a drug. Head ache remedies, cold medicines, laxa tives, and other nonprescription medi cines are drugs. When your physician asks, \"Are you taking any other medi cines?\" no drug is too unimportant to mention. The drugs cited in this article are among the most widely prescribed medicines, but they represent only a few of the hundreds of drugs that in volve signicant interactions. Don't start taking a second drug unless your physician knows about it. It's also a good idea to tell your phar macist when he lls a prescription what other drugs you are taking. He may wish to set up a personal record so that he can tell at a glance if you may be exposed to a drug interaction. Don't take a drug prescribed forsomeone else because it is \"good for stomach pain,\" or whatever it is that is troubling you. The drug in that pre scription may interact with something else you are taking, or it may not be suitable for you or your ailment. R e a d t h e l a b e l . O v e r - t h e - c o u n t e r medicines are required by FDA to contain information about signicant drug interactions. Remember that drugs have three names. There is the chemical name, which is usually not given on the label. There is what is called the generic name, which is the ofcial, established name for a drug; and there is the pro prietary name or the trade-marked brand name for that drug. It is important to remember this because the warnings printed on labels give the generic name. Thus, a number of nonprescription medicines such as the antacids warn against taking the medicine with tetracycline, which is the generic name of an antibiotic. How Achromycin, Azotrex, Kesso- Tetra Syrup, dozen others areproprietary names for tetracycline. So, unless you know the generic name as well as the proprietary name, you may be exposing yourself to a drug inter action. To avoid this, ask your physi cian or pharmacist to tell you the ge neric name of any prescription drugs you may be taking. It is also worth remembering that numerous drugs contain more than one ingredient. Empirin, a medicine widely used for relief of simple headache and other discomforts, contains aspirin as well as phenacetin and caffeine. Finally, since knowledge about drug interactions is by no means com plete, and individuals differ in their reactions to drugs, you may possibly experience a reaction to a mixture of drugs that is unknown, not only to your physician and pharmacist, but to the medical profession generally. So, if you are taking more than one drug and you become ill, by all means re port it to your physician or pharmacist. Timothy Larkin is a special assistant to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. F D A C o n s u m e r / M a r c h 1 9 7 6 / I I\u00a9Getting Specic About Bits And Oils A new regulation requires that instead of generalized names such as animal fat, vegetable oil, and shortening, labels on processed food will have to tell consumers the common or usual name of the fats and oils in the prod uct, such as lard, or coconut oil, or a shortening made of beef fat and soy bean oil. by Harold Hopkins E v e n i f t h e c u s t o m e r i s n o t a l w a y s right, he knows what he wants, a n d t h a t s e t t l e s t h e m a t t e r. T h i s simple logic was the controlling factor in roA's nal adoption of a regulation to require that the consumer be given more specic information on labels about the kinds of fats and oils in processed foods. The regulation, published in the Federal Register January 6, 1976, effectively rescinds an FDA moratorium on this require ment that has been in effect since 1940. S o m e c o m m e n t s f r o m t h e f o o d industry opposing the newly adopted requirements had argued that the consumer doesn't quite understand the situation, that the additional infor mation FDA contemplates for the label would confuse the purchaser, that fats and oils information is a complex matter better left to doctors, that the consumer might misinterpretand misuse the information he does get, that the public has been misled by news articles advocating more detailed fat labeling, that much of the new information proposed for labels is immaterial or of no use to the layman, and that providing it would be difcult and cost the consumer money. FDA didn't turn a deaf ear to these arguments, but merely pointed to the large pile of comments from irked and frustrated consumers, and said it believes the the food business will be able to comply with the new require ments without most of the unhappy consequences predicted by some food industry representatives. The new label information will be required for all processed foods entering interstate commerce on or after January 1, 1978, but will be per mitted on labels at any time before then. The regulation will require the listing on labels of fat or oil ingredients by their common or usual names, such as lard, or coconut oil, or beef fat and soybean oil shortening blend, instead of the more generalized names now permitted, such as animal fat, vegetable oil, or shortening. The more generalized names would still be permitted, but only when accompanied by a parenthetical listing of the com m o n o r u s u a l n a m e s o f t h e o i l s o r fats. Consumers and some physicianswho commented held that many persons are allergic to specic fats and oils in processed foods and that l a b e l i n f o r m a t i o n i s n e e d e d a b o u t these substances. Other comments said information is needed to make it possible to choose foods containing fats or oils known to be high in poly unsaturated or low in saturated fatty a c i d s . S t i l l o t h e r s w h o c o m m e n t e d said they need the information for religious reasons or personal prefer ence, or that they are entitled to it because of their basic right to know. In announcing adoption of the regulation. Commissioner of Food and Drugs Alexander M. Schmidt, M.D., said: \"Consumers have a basic right to know the source of fats and oils in the foods they eat, and have over whelmingly requested that the labeling of fats and oils be more specic.\" H e s a i d c o n s u m e r s \" w i l l n o w b e b e t t e r a b l e t o f o l l o w d o c t o r s ' o r d e r s t o restrict certain kinds of fats and oils in the diet. They will also be able to select the fats and oils they wish to consume for health and religious reasons and personal preference.\" The regulation will require use of the term \"saturated\" or \"partially saturated,\" where applicable, instead of \"hydrogenated\" for labeled descrip tions of fats or oils that have been hydrogenated. Hydrogenated means that the fats or oils have been treated FDA Consumer / March 1976 / 13When new FDA regulations go into effect, consumers who examine labels carefully will nd more specic infor mation on them about the kinds of fats and oils in processed foods. with hydrogen to convert them from a liquid to a solid form. FDA said it believes \"saturated\" has become a m o r e f a m i l i a r t e r m t o c o n s u m e r s t h a n \"hydrogenated.\" The word \"hardened\" will be permitted in parentheses after the word \"saturated\" as an expla nation of the processor's reason for the hydrogenation. Polyunsaturated and saturated refer to the molecular structure of various fats and oils. The terms may be signicant to consumers because some doctors have suggested that a diet high in saturated fats tends to cause an increase in the blood's level of cholesterol, a fat soluble substance contained in foods of animal origin and manufactured by nearly all body tissues. This concern has been about a heart disease condition called athero sclerosis, produced by deposits of cholesterol and other fatty substances on the inner walls of arteries, restrict ing blood flow. Although factors other than diet are associated with heart disease, some medical authorities believe that many people would receive health benet by reducing their total consumption of fat and by substituting moderate amounts of polyunsaturated vegetable fat for some of the saturated fats intheir diets. (Polyunsaturated fats are often saturated or hardened in rening processes). FDA takes no position a n d h a s m a d e n o r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s o n this question but in its nutrition label ing regulations permits manufacturers to provide information on food labels about the calories eontributed by fat to a specic food and its content of polyunsaturated and saturated fats and cholesterol. Such information permits individuals to follow a physician's advice to modify their dietary intake of fat and cholesterol. In adopting the requirement for more specic names of oils and fats, FDA noted that in 1940 it granted exemptions permitting the more generalized or class names on labels, but warned then that these names might at some future time no longer be satisfactory. Consumer comments have now shown such dissatisfaction, FDA said, and the 1940 exemptions are being rescinded when the new regu l a t i o n t a k e s e ff e c t . Fats or oils must be listed in the ingredient statement in descending order of predominance, except where blends of fats or oils are used. In this case, the blend may be listed in its order of predominance, such as \"animal fat and vegetable shortening\"or \"blend of vegetable oils,\" followed in parentheses by a listing of the fats or oils in the blend by their common or usual names, such as \"lard\" or \"peanut oil.\" If the blend of fats or oils is the predominant ingredient in the food, then the parenthetical listing must be in order of predominance. If the blend is not the predominant ingredient, the parenthetical listing need not be in order of predominance and may include fats or oils that are not always present if they are identi ed by such words as \"or\" or \"and/or\" to indicate that they may not be present. In addition to the new requirements for labeling of fats and oils, the regu lation permits class names to be used on ingredient labels to embrace various forms of certain milk or egg products. For instance, fresh whole milk, concentrated milk, reconstituted milk, and dry whole milk may all be declared simply as milk. Similar simplied class terms are permitted for various forms of skim milk, buttermilk, whey, cream, butterfat, eggs, egg whites, and egg yolks.

New FDA regu lations, and commonsense precautions, can help cosmetics users avoid results they don't want. by Margaret Morrison C o s m e t i c s m a y c o m e i n s m a l l p a c k ages, but they are big business. Americans spend about $7 billion a year on cosmetics\u2014everything from toothpaste to cuticle softener. Products that are classied as cosmetics include shampoos and suntan lotions, deodor ants and douches, night creams and nail polish\u2014and hundreds of others. Though cosmetics used to be thought of as a \"woman's world,\" the market now includes many products promoted strictly for men, and many even for children. Most consumers use these products without any thought of hazard, and usually there is none. But a study con d u c t e d f o r F D A s h o w s t h a t a d v e r s e r e a c t i o n s t o c o s m e t i c s o c c u r f a r m o r e frequently than had been assumed in the past. (The study included bath soaps, many of which are not classied as cosmetics under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and thus are exempt from FDA regulation, and antiperspi- rants, which are classied by FDA as over-the-counter drugs because their purpose is to alter a bodily function. These products were included in the survey because many consumers con s i d e r t h e m c o s m e t i c s a n d a d v e r t i s e ments for them often emphasize their cosmetic effects.)The study, begun in September 1974, was the rst attempt by a Fed eral agency to obtain information di rectly from consumers and to verify detailed information on the use of cosmetics and injuries associated with their use. FDA usually receives its in formation about the extent of adverse reactions to cosmetics through con sumer complaints, voluntary industry reports, and reports from hospitals. E a c h o f t h e s e s o u r c e s h a s l i m i t a t i o n s as a reporting device. Consumers usually do not report a d v e r s e r e a c t i o n s f r o m c o s m e t i c s t o F D A o r t o t h e m a n u f a c t u r e r, a n d neither do the physicians who treat t h e m . C o s m e t i c s m a n u f a c t u r e r s h a v e been reluctant to pass on information to FDA concerning complaints from c o n s u m e r s a b o u t a d v e r s e r e a c t i o n s . Although FDA has developed volun tary industry programs in an effort to obtain more complete information on consumer injuries related to use of cosmetics, the response has not been sufcient to provide reliable data. In 1975, only 123 cosmetics manufac turers and distributors, from an indus try total of about 4,000 rms, volun tarily supplied to FDA any 1974 con sumer reports of adverse reactions. The hospital reports provide information only on cosmetic-related adverse reactions treated in emergency rooms. B e c a u s e o f t h e l i m i t a t i o n s o f t h e s e s o u r c e s a n d t h e n e e d f o r b e t t e r i n f o r mation to serve as the basis for regu latory policy decisions, FDA under took a study to collect data on the frequency and types of cosmetic-re lated adverse reactions experienced by consumers. A panel of consumers was selected for the study. FDA wanted to determine the extent to which ad verse reactions reported by these con sumers were veried by physicians as being cosmetic-related, and the sever ity of the reactions. FDA also wanted information on the overall usage pat terns of cosmetics, and the incidence o f a d v e r s e r e a c t i o n s f r o m t h e v a r i o u s types of cosmetics used. According to the study, a high per centage of the adverse reactions re ported by participants was conrmed by dermatologists as being denitely or most probably caused by use of cosmetics. On the basis of this nding, FDA believes that the reporting by consumers of adverse reactions to cos metics can be considered by and large reliable. Moreover, the relatively high incidence of conrmed adverse reac tions among study participants, when compared to industry-reported data. F D A C o n s u m e r / M a r c h 1 9 7 6 / 1 5suggests that only a small fraction of the adverse reactions actually experi enced by consumers are reported to the industry, and by the manufacturers to FDA. When considering the study's nd ings, it should be noted that the par ticipating consumers were not selected at random, but were a carefully chosen panel of people who had demonstrated in previous consumer behavior studies that they would be dependable report ers, and who indicated a willingness to supply information on their use of cosmetics. The makeup of the panel, however, closely resembled the 1970 Census in regard to the socio-eco nomic characteristics of the U.S. pop ulation as a whole. The ndings are based on cosmetics use and adverse reactions reported for a period covering September through November 1974. Since the panel was not randomly selected and the study covered a specic three-month period.the ndings cannot be statistically pro jected to the entire population, or to annual usage of cosmetics. Neverthe less, because of the similarity of the panel structure to the population as a whole, the ndings do provide overall perspective on the nature and extent of cosmetic-related injuries. A consumer panel of 10,050 fam ilies located throughout the United States was recruited for the study. The total number of individual family members in the study was 35,490. The 35,490 study participants re ported 703 adverse reactions that they believed resulted from the use of cos metics. Of this number, 589 or 84 percent were conrmed by dermatolo gists as denitely or most probably caused by cosmetic products. Virtually a l l o f t h e a d v e r s e r e a c t i o n s i n v o l v e d skin irritations or related problems. Of the 589 conrmed adverse reac tions, the vast majority, about 86 per cent, were considered mild; about ilpercent were classied as moderate; and less than 3 percent as severe. For purposes of the study, a mild a d v e r s e r e a c t i o n w a s d e n e d a s a minor irritation that would not require medication or a physician's attention; a m o d e r a t e r e a c t i o n w a s d e n e d a s one that persisted for a prolonged period and could cause loss of time from normal activities; and a severe reaction was dened as being painful and severe enough to ordinarily re quire a physician's evaluation and w h i c h w o u l d r e s u l t i n a l o s s o f t i m e f r o m n o r m a l a c t i v i t i e s . The type of cosmetic product that caused the largest number of adverse reactions reported by study partici pants and conrmed by physicians was the deodorant/antiperspirant group, with 182 incidents.

It should be noted that soap was used by more study participants than any other type of cosmetic and the deodorant/anti- perspirant group ranked third in terms of use. When the rate of adverse reactions is measured, however, the picture is s o m e w h a t d i ff e r e n t . T h e r a t e i s b a s e d o n t h e n u m b e r o f a d v e r s e r e a c t i o n s caused by a certain type of product in relation to the number of people using it. The ten categories showing the highest rate of adverse reactions were: deodorant/antiperspirants; de pilatories (chemical facial skin cream/ cleaner; and nail polish. The overall average rate of 6.9 con rmed adverse reactions per 10,000 users of cosmetic products for a one- month period constitute a substantially higher rate of adverse reactions to cosmetics than any data in the past have suggested. Two new FDA regulations should help consumers use cosmetics with a greater degree of safety. One of these requires that cosmetics manufac tured after November 30, 1976, must carry a list of their ingredients on the product label. If a consumer knows a certain substance has caused a prob lem in the past, he or she can avoid products that contain it. The second regulation deals with so- called hypoallergenic cosmetics. Many cosmetic products claim to be \"hypo allergenic,\" implying they are safer to use by people who have had allergic reactions to cosmetics. In the past, however, the term has had no uniform meaning and usually no proof was available demonstrating the implied lower potential for adverse reactions of products calling themselves hypo allergenic. The FDA regulation, orig inally scheduled to become effective in June 1975, would require proof beforea m a n u f a c t u r e r c a n l a b e l a c o s m e t i c \"hypoallergenic.\" The effective date has been delayed, however, because t w o c o s m e t i c m a n u f a c t u r e r s h a v e e n tered suit in a U.S. district court against the FDA and this regulation. Meanwhile, consumers should real i z e t h a t w h i l e m o s t c o s m e t i c s a r e s a f e when used properly, there is a poten tial for adverse reactions, even from products that they have used many times before. The best precaution is to read the label on cosmetic products and carefully follow the directions for use, including making a \"patch test\" if one is recommended or if the user has a history of allergic reactions. And if adverse reactions do occur, they should be reported to FDA and to the cos metic rm whose name is noted on the label of the product.

FDA Consumer / March 1976 j 17Drug Price AdsMust 1^11 18 / March 1976 / FDA ConsutnerTo help consumers get a clearer picture of what they will be getting for their money, FDA now requires that when pharmacies list or advertise pre scription drug prices they must include certain stipulated information. These rules apply only in those States that require or permit retail pharmacies to list or advertise these prices. by Annabel Hecht If you live in a State which allowspharmacies to advertise the price of prescription drugs, any price list you receive in the mail or see posted in a drug store or any printed or broadcast advertisement must now include the following information: the drug's brand name, if any; the drug's generic name, if any; the drug's dosage strength (100 milligrams, 5 grains, etc.); the dosage form (tablets, cap sules, liquid, etc.); and the price charged for a specific quantity of the drug. The price quoted must include all charges to the consumer, such as the cost of the drug, professional fees, and handling charges, if there are any. Information about any professional or convenience services for which charges are made, handling and mailing costs, and discounts to special groups such as senior citizens, may be included in price lists and ads if such information is not false or misleading. Price lists or ads are prohibited from making any claims or comments about a drug's safety or effectiveness or the uses for which it is recommended. These requirements, which apply to all pharmacies that post or otherwise advertise the price of prescription drugs, have been established by the Food and Drug Administration to en s u r e t h a t c o n s u m e r s h a v e a l l t h e i n formation they need to make meaning ful price comparisons. At present these rules apply only in the approximately 20 States that now require or permit posting of prescription drug prices in retail pharmacies and the advertising of these prices in newspapers or on radio and television. Advertising of prescription drug prices is prohibited in 30 States, eitherby State law or the codes of ethics of State pharmaceutical associations. T h e s e l a w s o r c o d e s o f e t h i c s a r e n o t affected by FDA's new requirements. The new FDA regulation does not in any way require public posting or ad vertising of prescription drug prices by anyone. It is intended pl^imarily to as sure that where drug price advertising is permitted it is done in a way that provides consumers with accurate in f o r m a t i o n t h a t e n a b l e s t h e m t o m a k e valid comparisons of the prices charged by competing pharmacies. Although the regulation of advertis ing of over-the-counter drugs falls w i t h i n t h e b a i l i w i c k o f t h e F e d e r a l Trade Commission, FDA was given authority over prescription drug ad vertising by the 1962 Amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Thus, price disclosure as a part of ad vertising and labeling comes under FDA regulation no matter how it is done\u2014through material sent by mail, posted in drug stores, printed in news papers, or aired on radio or television. The rules establishing just what should go into these advertisements came about as a result of numerous inquiries regarding FDA policy on posting of prescription drug prices and are in tended to clear up any misunder standings about the Agency's require ments. First published as proposed rules in the Federal Register in June 1973, t h e r u l e s e v o l v e d i n t o t h e i r n a l f o r m after FDA studied comments and sug gestions from trade and professional associations, pharmacists, consumers and consumer organizations, and man ufacturers. The rules became effective January 19, 1976, although pharma cies may use existing catalogs, price lists, or advertisements until the next printing or for one year, whichever c o m e s r s t . In response to comments on its pro posed rules, FDA said that it does not believe that price disclosure will lead to drug abuse or excessive demand for a specic drug or specic quantities of drugs, or that it will influence con sumers to use prescription drugs with out consulting a physician. FDA pointed out that the regulation is ap plicable to those drug products whichare available to the consumer only on prescription from a medical practi tioner. Experience in communities where price disclosure is permitted has not produced evidence that the regula tion would restrict or destroy the pro fessionalism of the practice of phar macy, the Agency said. The issue of whether advertising of prescription drug prices should be permitted has been the subject of con siderable public debate. TTie Federal Trade Commission (FTC), after a study by the Commission staff, re vealed wide variations in the prices charged for the same drug in different stores in some of the Nation's major cities, and has proposed a Trade Regu lation Rule which would overturn State and local laws prohibiting prescription drug advertising. The Commission has e s t i m a t e d t h a t c o n s u m e r s w o u l d b e able to save some $300 million a year if restrictions on publicizing compara tive price information were removed. Public hearings on the FTC proposal have been held in Chicago, San Fran cisco, and Washington, D.C. A nal decision on the proposed ruling may be made within a fev.^ months. The issue of prescription drug price advertising also is being tested in the courts. The U.S. Department of Justice h a s s u e d t h e A m e r i c a n P h a r m a c e u t i c a l Association and the Michigan State Pharmaceutical Association to force them to change their codes of ethics to allow druggist members to advertise. The national organization has already revised its code and the membership has approved the new language which declares: \"A pharmacist should strive to provide information to patients re garding professional services truthful ly, accurately and fully, and should avoid misleading patients regarding the nature, cost or value of pharmaceuti cal service.\" A case challenging a Virginia law that prohibits pharmacies from adver tising drug prices, is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. If the court nds the Virginia statute unconstitu tional, all such State laws could be nullied. Annabel Hecht is a staff writer with FDA's ofce of Public Affairs. FDA Consumer / March 1976 f 19News Highlights Hearing Asked on Proposed DES Ban FDA has received four requests from manufacturers for a hearing on its proposal to withdraw diethylstilbestrol (DES), a synthetic hormone, from use as a growth pro- m o t a n t i n a n i m a l s . D E S i s k n o w n t o c a u s e c a n c e r. FDA previously had banned use of DES to stimulate the growth of animals used for human food, but that ban was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1974. The court said that FDA had not provided DES manufacturers with an adequate opportunity for a hearing. On January 12, 1976, FDA again proposed to ban DES as a growth promotant and, to comply with the court order, offered manufacturers 30 days to request a hearing. If the requests show that a hearing is justied, FDA's next step will be to arrange for one before an administra tive law judge. Any hearing could be expected to last for a month or more. The judge's ndings would be turned over to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, whose deci sion must be based solely on the record made at the hear ing. The Commissioner's decision would be appealable to the courts. F D A ' s a c t i o n s t o b a n D E S a r e b a s e d o n c o n t i n u e d n d ings of DES residues in animal livers. Under a 1962 law, DES must be allowed as a drug in animals used for human consumption as long as no residues are found in edible tissues after slaughter. Requests for a hearing were received from Dawes Labo ratories, Chicago Heights, Illinois; Vineland Laboratories, Vineland, New Jersey; Hess and Clark, a Division of Rhodia, Inc., Ashland, Ohio; and Franklin Laboratories, Inc., Denver, Colorado. Guidelines Planned on X Rays in Pregnancy FDA has announced plans to develop guidelines con cerning exposure of women of childbearing age to ionizing radiation from medical diagnostic procedures. The an nouncement appeared in the December 15 Federal Reg ister. Exposure of the developing human embryo or fetus to ionizing radiation may result in harmful effects, including an increased risk of childhood leukemia. The proposed guidelines will aim at reducing such risks by recommending procedures for x-ray examinations of potentially pregnant women that will minimize unnecessary exposure of the fetus. As presently conceived, the guidelines will provide rec ommendations to clinicians regarding exposure of possibly pregnant women to ionizing radiation from both x-ray examinations and nuclear medicine procedures. FDA is studying certain diagnostic x-ray and nuclear medicinepractices to determine what actions may be taken to mini mize fetal exposure. The guidelines will be implemented through educational programs and cooperative activities with professional or ganizations. Expiration Dates Proposed for All Drugs FDA has proposed a regulation requiring that all pre scription and nonprescription drugs bear an expiration date. Expiration dates now are required on all antibiotics and certain other drugs known to have stability problems. The proposed requirement for expiration dates is part of a group of proposals put forth by FDA to strengthen its regulations to insure that drugs are made under sanitary conditions and meet all standards for quality, purity, and potency. The regulations, known as Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations (GMP's), set forth requirements for making drugs. In addition to expiration dates, among the major new provisions in the updated regulations are: Companies must set forth in writing their manufactur ing and control procedures. There must be clear lines of responsibility within a company for quality control. The regulations also set forth requirements for qualica tions of technical personnel; standards for drug ingredients; control of total environment in which drugs are produced and stored; packaging and sealing of nished drug prod ucts; correct and accurate labeling; and complaint les for followup of unexpected defects in products. The proposed regulations were published in the Federal Register, February 13, 1976. Comments may be sub mitted within 120 days to the Hearing Clerk, Food and Drug Administration, Room 4-65, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Budget of $226 Million Asked for FDA The Administration has proposed to Congress a budget for FDA for scal year 1977 (Oct.l, 1976-Sept.30, 1977) of $226.2 million, which compares with an operating budget of $208.6 million for the current scal year. The proposed budget emphasizes the Agency's priorities in the following program activities: Additional inspections and special investigations of medical device manufacturers. Development of Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations for medical devices. Expanded surveillance of preclinical and clinical in vestigations conducted by the manufacturers of drugs for use by humans. 20 / March 1976 / FDA Consumer Establishment and enforcement of bioequivaleney standards for prescription drugs. Timely and accurate responses to public inquiries under the Freedom of Information Act. Additional support of studies by FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research, particularly in the area of hormone research. Renovation and modernization of existing facilities and expansion of laboratory capabilities. Of the $17.6 million increase over last year's budget, approximately $10.3 million will support increased Federal pay costs, provide for increased General Services Adminis tration charges for space and services, and offset partially the impact of inflation on Agency operating costs. The budget also includes $3.1 million for the repair and im provement of existing buildings and facilities, including the expansion of laboratories, and $4.2 million that will enable the Agency to ll 71 new positions and to expand program initiatives. Foreign Nations Ban Birth Control Pill Several foreign countries, including Germany, Canada, and Great Britain, have banned the sale of birth control pills containing megestrol acetate after a study done at FDA's request indicated it caused breast cancer in dogs. Megestrol acetate has never been marketed in the United States as an oral contraceptive. FDA routinely requires long-term animal studies before any drug can be marketed for human use. Following animal studies with megestrol acetate, FDA in the late sixties and early seventies allowed limited studies of the drug in women. In 1972, after notic ing a signicant number of test dogs developing breast nodules (none of them malignant), FDA ordered that megestrol acetate be discontinued in human oral contra ceptive studies. The animal studies continued and sub sequently showed that some dogs receiving high and inter mediate doses of megestrol acetate developed malignant breast nodules. FDA has taken action many times in the past against birth control pills which have been associated with the de velopment of breast nodules in test animals\u2014whether can cerous or not. For example, two contraceptives Provest and C-Quens, were withdrawn from the market in 1970 on this basis. All oral contraceptives now marketed in the United States have been shown free of negative ndings in long- term animal studies. FDA to Assure Drug Quality for All Agencies With the signing of an agreement between FDA and the Department of Defense, FDA has assumed full responsi bility for assuring the quality of all drugs and biologicals (including whole blood, blood products such as plasma, and vaccines) purchased by the Federal Government. The new agreement, effective January 1, 1976, was signed by Alexander M. Schmidt, M.D., Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and Dr. James R. Cowan, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health and Environment. Earlier agreements were signed by FDA with the Vet erans Administration and the Health Services Administra tion of the U.S. Public Health Service. Under the agreements, sole responsibility for all testingand inspection of all drugs and biologicals bought by the Federal Government will be consolidated within FDA. Be fore the consolidation program, the Department of Defense and other Government departments and agencies conducted their own separate inspection and testing programs. \"Consolidation of these quality assurance programs with in FDA will avoid duplication and afford the taxpayer a savings of about three-quarters of a million dollars per year,\" Dr. Schmidt said. \" I t w i l l a l s o e a s e t h e b u r d e n o n s o m e m a n u f a c t u r e r s w h o will now have to deal only with a single agency on drug and biological quality assurance,\" he added. The move to consolidate medical products quality assur ance programs grew out of studies in 1973 and 1974 by the Ofce of Management and Budget and the General Ac counting Ofce. Both recommended that FDA be respon sible for quality assurance of all medical products procured by Government agencies. Consolidation of drug and biological product quality assurance is the rst phase of the program. Quality assur ance for other medical products, such as devices, will be consolidated in FDA under a second phase to be announced later. New Labeling Due for ^The Pill/ Estrogens FDA has announced several major steps designed to alert physicians and the public to new hazards associated with the use of female estrogens and birth control pills. Commissioner of Food and Drugs Alexander M. Schmidt, M.D., said the Agency is about to propose major revisions in the physician and patient labeling for birth control pills, and also will propose to require that a patient brochure be contained in each package of birth control pills. FDA has required since 1970 that a package insert containing infor mation for patients be included with birth control pills, but the new information would be considerably more detailed. The Commissioner also announced that FDA will require major changes in physician labeling for female estrogens to reflect recent evidence that associates their use with cancer of the uterus in post-menopausal women. The new labeling will recommend that estrogens be used in treating the meno pause only for \"hot flashes\"; will warn about the associa tion between cancer of the uterus and prolonged use of estrogens; and will recommend that the lowest effective dose be used at all times, and the drug be discontinued or re duced in dosage at regular intervals to assess whether it is still needed. Dr. Schmidt said FDA is considering how best to supply information about estrogens directly to patients, but this is a complex problem because of the diverse uses which estrogens have and the many dosage forms on the market. Dr. Schmidt also said that: FDA would recommend continued \"public investment\" in studies to collect better information about the long-term risks of drugs. FDA will notify physicians and other health profes sionals through its Drug Bulletin of the new labeling for estrogens and birth control pills, when nal labeling is adopted. FDA is in the process of determining what studies are needed on the relationship between estrogens and cancer of the uterus.

In addition, ve lots of frog legs from India and Bangladesh, valued at more than $20,000, were detained. Examination of one of the lots revealed the presence of Salmonella. The other four were detained without laboratory analysis because they were shipped by companies whose products have had a high incidence of Salmonella. Import ers may analyze these lots and if they are found free of Salmonella\u2014and FDA tests confirm the findings\u2014they will be released to the importers.

Inspections by the New York Dis trict resulted in Federal action to pre v e n t t w o N e w Yo r k m e t h a d o n e t r e a t ment programs from increasing their patient load until they comply with uniform FDA regulations and proto cols required of all treatment programs for the safe use of the drugs. New York District investigators had found gross deciencies in the operations of the two treatment centers. The deciencies in cluded a shortage of physicians, im proper recordkeeping on patients' pro gress, and failure of physicians to sign their written orders. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a permanent injunction di recting Sylvan L. Sacolick, M.D., and Arnold J. Schecter, M.D., of the Syl van L. Sacolick Professional Corp. to comply with the FDA regulations. And the U.S. Court for the Eastern Districtof New York issued a temporary re straining order, the rst step toward a possible injunction, directing the New York City Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program at Jamaica Hospi tal, Jamaica, New York, and its re sponsible ofcials and related city health organization to comply with the same regulations. Joint action by FDA's Buffalo and Philadelphia Districts resulted in Gov ernment seizure of 933 cases of mis- branded garlic bread at a warehouse near Erie, Pennsylvania. Produced and shipped by B & B Better Baked Foods, Inc., Westeld, New York, the mis labeled bread was discovered by Buf falo District investigators during a rou tine inspection. The package labeling failed to declare the common or usual name of all ingredients used, and the net contents statement was too small to be seen easily by consumers. B & B failed to take steps to correct the label ing, as required by law, and instead shipped the bread to the Erie ware house. At the request of the Philadel phia District, which had been notied of the shipment by the Buffalo District, 22 / March 1976 / FDA Consumerinspectors from the Pennsylvania De partment of Agriculture embargoed the lot until it could be seized under an order issued by the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Pennsylvania. Over a two-week period, ve ship ments of miscellaneous drugs from Canada and Switzerland valued at $15,000 were detained by the Buffalo District because they did not meet the Drug Listing Requirements of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Drug Listing Requirements state that before a drug can be shipped a list of its contents must be led with FDA. Twenty cases of a \"Natural Power Food Supplement\" offered for import by the D. H. McPherson Co. of Paris, Canada, were refused entry by FDA's Buffalo District because investigators found the product misbranded on the basis of false and misleading thera peutic claims, failure to list active in gredients, and the lack of special die tary information required for vitamin- mineral supplements. Pioneer Food Stores Cooperative, Inc., Carlstadt, New Jersey, and Sey mour Lewenthal, the rm's general manager, pleaded guilty in the U.S. Magistrate's Court for the District of New Jersey to a 20-count criminal charge of rodent and insect District ofce had discovered extensive rodent and insect activity and found evidence of contamination of large lots of food. Judge William H. Hunt assessed a ne of $125 for each of the 20 counts, to taling $2,500. The inspection resulted in Government seizure of all the food stuffs in the warehouse. Through a company petition to the court, recon ditioning of all foodstuffs was per mitted under FDA supervision. Campanella Bakeries, Ine., Jersey City, New Jersey, is back in the dough after acting to eliminate an insect prob lem in its flour handling system. The rm had voluntarily agreed to a court injunction closing down the plant be cause of poor sanitary conditions which could have resulted in insect contamination of foods. FDA's Newark District had petitioned the U.S. District Court for the Distriet of New Jerseyto shut down the bakery following a routine inspection which revealed the poor sanitary conditions. The correc tive action was subsequently taken by the rm's ofcers Joseph J. Campa nella, Samuel Griglio, and Joseph R. Griglio. FDA will continue to monitor the rm's operations to ensure that acceptable sanitary conditions are be ing maintained. A routine inspection by FDA's San Juan District led to Government sei zure of 151,000 pounds of pinto beans, pink beans, and annatto seeds at the Monllor-Bosico Warehouse in Ponce, Puerto Rico, because of insect and ro dent contamination. Annatto seeds form the basis of a food dye that is used to add color to oils, cheese, and butter. FDA took under consideration the rm's proposal to recondition the three lots of contaminated beans and seeds, which are valued at $50,000. REGION ni U.S. marshals seized 770 pounds of frozen chubs at Vita Foods, Inc., S. Skarloff Division, Philadelphia, Penn sylvania, following an FDA analysis of samples showing that the sh were contaminated with dieldrin, an unsafe chemical pesticide. The sh samples were taken during a routine inspeetion by FDA's Philadelphia District. Carlton Clifton & Sons, Milford, Delaware, a manufacturer of low-acid canned vegetables, closed down its operation after a routine inspection by FDA's Philadelphia District found the rm's processing methods and manu facturing practices to be in violation of FDA regulations for low-acid canned foods. The rm has applied to FDA for an emergency processing permit to continue canning operations while the violations are remedied. REGION IV Approximately 17,000 cases of Spanish canned pimientos were re called by Cherokee Products Co., Had dock, Georgia, after FDA's Atlanta District reported that the acidity of the product was too low. Too little acidity in pimientos can lead to the growth of Clostridium botulinum, an organism that causes botulinal poisoning. TheAtlanta District monitored the nation wide recall of the pimientos. Home canners affected by the can ning lid shortage were saved from a potentially dangerous substitute by FDA and Jean Thwaite, food editor of the Atlanta Constitution. Mrs. Thwaite became wary when she read a news release that described a reusable canning seal that could be used safely on empty jars of mayonnaise, mustard, and similar products for canning other foods. She reported her suspicions to Mildred Coleman, FDA's consumer affairs ofcer in Atlanta. Because the seals were being distributed by a New Jersey rm, Monmouth Manor House, Inc., FDA's Newark District was alerted. Investigation conrmed Mrs. Thwaite's suspicion that the lids, lined only with cardboard seals, were not sufcient protection to prevent food spoilage and possible serious food- borne illness. An immediate followup resulted in the termination of the rm's plans to market the product. Joint action by FDA's NashviUe District and Kentucky State ofcials made possible the reconditioning of ap proximately 125,000 bushels of ro dent-deled soybeans at the Wabash Elevator Co., Uniontown, Kentucky. Kentucky ofcials had quarantined the soybeans, after Nashville District in vestigator Michael A. Chappell found one storage building and its contents contaminated with rodent infestations during a routine inspection. FDA and State ofcials met with the owner- operator of the rm and an agreement was reached on a method of recondi tioning the soybeans. Provisions of the agreement include removal of all the rodent lth, followed by heat treat ment to destroy pathogenic organisms that might be present on the surface of the beans. Some 125 pints of industrial-grade dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a sub stance used commercially as a paint stabilizer and as a solvent for insecti cides, herbicides, and fungicides, was seized by the Government after an inspeetion by FDA's Orlando District at Synergetic Products, Tampa, Flori da. During the inspeetion, instigated by a trade complaint, Orlando District Investigator Lee Bowers found that FDA Consumer / March 1976 / 23Nick Palermo, owner of the rm, was repacking and selling industrial grade DMSO as a veterinary drug without a New Animal Drug Application. Pa lermo had obtained the substance from a chemical company by signing a waiver stating that it would not be used as a drug for man or animals. The sei zure included raw materials and DMSO valued at more than $1,000. FDA has revoked the licenses of Orlando Plasma Corp. and Plasma Corp. of Clearwater following several inspections by the Orlando District of the rm's parent company, Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., Miami, Florida. The inspections revealed con tinued unacceptable procedures for assuring distribution of nonhepatitis antigen reactive plasma. In an earlier action. Automated Medical Labora tories had recalled over 20,000 liters of Source Plasma (Human), valued at $500,000 and manufactured by its two subsidiaries, after investigators found inadequate hepatitis testing and poor recordkeeping at the Orlando facility, which also conducted hepatitis testing for the Clearwater facility. REGION Vn An investigation by FDA's Kansas City Field Ofce led to Government seizure of $41,000 worth of frozen po tato products in possession of Terminal Ice and Cold Storage Co., Bettendorf, Iowa. The products were water dam aged by two sprinkler system accidents in the storage facility. Water from the sprinkler system washed berglass insulation, dirt, and sand into the cases of the product. Attempts to sal vage the ice-covered cases was unsuc cessful because the plastic bags con taining the products tore open, expos ing the food. HaJlam & Son, Inc., Springeld, Missouri, and two of its ofcers, Charles E. Hallman and Donald D. Williams, pleaded guilty to a one- count charge of storing food under in sanitary conditions and insect contami nation of interstate shipments of peanut butter. Inspections by the Kansas City Field Ofce had shown a pattern of violations by the company which prompted FDA to seek legal action. The U.S. magistrate in the WesternDistrict of Missouri ned the corpora tion and both defendants $50 each for a total of $150. Blood Plasma Donors Center, Kan sas City, Missouri, voluntarily closed after an inspection by investigators from FDA's Kansas City Field Ofce, assisted by an investigator from FDA's Bureau of Biologies, revealed examples of forgeries, inadequate production rec ords, overbleeding of donors, incom plete labeling information, and other deviations from FDA's Good Manu facturing Practice Regulations for blood-processing facilities. Over 1,900 units of human plasma produced by the rm and valued at $19,000 will be relabeled for use in laboratory tests only. The rm will not reopen until it is in compliance with the GMP's relat ing to blood banks. The Government seized over 21,000 pounds of bagged whole yellow corn at the Spanish Gardens T aco House, Kansas City, Kansas, following a joint inspection by the Kansas City Field Ofce and the Kansas City, Kansas- Wyandotte County Health Department which revealed insect infestation. The inspection also revealed live insect in festation in corn used to manufacture taco shells, and dead insects floating on com in the cooking vat. Another 17,000 pounds of corn found in bulk storage and in cooking tanks was em bargoed by the County Health Department. Later, the embargoed corn found in the cooking tanks was voluntarily destroyed, and the infested com in bulk storage was converted to animal food. A routine inspection by the Kansas City Field Ofce revealed an active rodent problem in the flour section of United A-G Stores, an Omaha, Ne braska warehouse. The rm was able to recondition some of the contami nated lots, but 30,950 pounds of flour products valued at $6,500 was volun tarily destroyed at a sanitary landll. C o n s u m e r c o n c e r n o v e r s o m e M i s souri pharmacists recommending the use of salicylic acid in place of citric acid for home canning prompted action by the Kansas City Field Ofce. The Field Ofce advised the Missouri Phar maceutical Association via telephone and follow-up letter that salicylic acid is not a permitted additive for foods, nor have any petitions with supporting data been received to verify its safety for use in foods. Pharmacists should not suggest the use of salicylic acid to customers when citric acid is not avail able, FDA said. Fumaric, malic, or succinic acids all occur naturally in fruit acids and are the only effective substitutes for citric acid which have been tested scientically to produce the same effect for increasing acidity without an appreciable flavor change. The basic reason for use of citric acid in preserving home canning foods is to increase acidity. Vinegar (acetic acid) may be used also, when the resultant flavor is acceptable. Voluntary destruction of 3,247 pounds of bulk Gynben vaginal tablets valued at $111,000 was carried out by Private Formulae, St. Louis, Missouri, after the drug was found by FDA to be ineffective in treating vaginal infec tions. An inspector from FDA's St. Louis Resident Post witnessed the de struction. REGION VIII F D A ' s D e n v e r D i s t r i c t o f c e s e n t regulatory letters to four area drag rms warning them against selling pre scription veterinary drugs to lay people without requiring a prescription. Den ver investigators had conrmed reports that some indiscriminate selling was 24 / March 1976 / FDA Consumergoing on by making several anony mous purchases at these rms. Some of the drugs were of a type and quality that could be diverted to human use. The four rms receiving the regulatory letters were Great Plains Chemical Co., Greeley, Colorado; Steve Regan Co., and A. A. Callister Co., both of Salt Lake City, Utah; and Bridgerland Vet erinary Supply, Inc., Ogden, Utah. REGION X A recent drug purchase by a Port land, Oregon, salvage rm turned out to be a little \"too hot to handle\" and various nonprescription drug items to taling $26,000 were destroyed under supervision of FDA's Seattle District oflBce. The drugs had been purchased from a California pharmacy which had been involved in a re where tempera tures rose as high as 1,750\u00b0 Fahrenheit for up to 30 minutes. Initially, the sal vage rm had planned to recondition the merchandise by cleaning the con tainers, without considering the effectthe high temperatures might have had on the potency or chemical composi tion of the drugs. Discussion with Seat tle District investigators on the temp erature problems and the need for actu al analysis of the drugs for potency, convinced the salvage rm's owner that it was not economically feasible to re condition the drugs. Bobbie E. Burns, president of the Oregon Macaroni Manufacturing Co., Portland, Oregon, has agreed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon not to receive raw materials or sell or distribute his products until all necessary actions are taken to prevent food adulteration. The voluntary shut down came after Seattle District in vestigators sought legal action to close down the operation following an in spection which discovered extensive insect activity in and about the rm's manufacturing equipment. U.S. District Judge Robert C. Belloni placed Burns on the witness stand and obtained the agreement under oath. In addition.Judge Belloni ruled the plant must un dergo an inspection by a sanitation ex pert, who then must give FDA written notication when the facility is in com pliance. Only after an FDA inspection veries this compliance can the rm resume operation. The Seattle District refused admis sion to the United States of 156 sets of soft contact lenses produced by M & N Contact Lenses Co., Vancouver, Can ada, because the lenses, valued at $3,950, had not been approved for use in this country. U.S. Customs agents at Blaine, Washington, detained a truck transporting the lenses across the U.S. Canada border for failure to comply with U.S. Customs Regulations. Be cause of the recent Canadian postal strike, many Canadian rms along the border transported their mail across the border and entered it into the U.S. Mail System. The contact lenses were wrapped for rst class mail shipment from M & N and were addressed to 39 different U.S. consignees. State Actions S e a f o o d F i r m F i n e d Joint action by FDA's San Francisco District and California State health in spectors resulted in conviction of Ocean Beauty Seafoods, Inc., on one count of violating the State's Food Sanitation Act. Judge Rothwell B. Ma son of Sacramento Municipal Court ned the corporation $500, and im posed an additional $125 ne to go to t h e S t a t e ' s L a w E n f o r c e m e n t O f c e r s ' Fund. The State had led charges against the rm after repeated inspec tions by FDA investigators and State health ofcials found apparent viola tions of the State's sanitation statutes and Food Sanitation Act. Three corpo rate ofcers, as well as the corporation, were charged. Charges against the of cers, as well as two other counts against the rm, were dropped by Judge Mason at the trial when the rm pleaded guilty to one count of violat ing the Food Sanitation Act. The Stateof California Fraud Section still has a case pending against Ocean Beauty, charging the rm with distributing short weight products. Milk Destroyed The Denver Department of Health and Hospitals destroyed over 7,000 gallons of Grade A milk which was contaminated with antibiotics. Health ofcials discovered the milk contami nation during routine sampling and analysis of a truckload of raw milk from Utah which had been delivered to a Denver dairy. But before the dairy received the laboratory report on the sample, the 2,916 gallons of contami nated milk had been pasteurized, blend ed with other milk, and bottled for distribution to commercial outlets and the school lunch program. A review of the plant records made it possible for the contaminated milk, now over 7,000 gallons, to be isolated and destroyedbefore it could be distributed. The Utah Department of Agriculture launched an investigation to determine the source of the contaminated milk. Stored Milk Contaminated More than 35,000 pounds of con taminated milk was destroyed by the Butte-Silver Bow County Health De partment at the coimty sanitary land ll, near Butte, Montana, after an of cial of Safeway Stores, Inc., notied the Montana Department of Livestock of a processing plant accident. The acci dent involved a Safeway employee who turned the wrong valve on the auto mated cleaning system and pumped cleaning solution into a Safeway stor age tank containing the milk. The Montana Department of Livestock learned of the accident from a tele phone call by the Safeway plant man ager. FDA Consumer / March 1976 / 25Seizures and Postal Service Cases SEIZURE ACTIONS charging violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act are published when they are reported by the FDA District Ofce. A total of 23 actions to remove from the consumer market products charged to be violative was reported in December. These included 20 seizures of foods: 2 involved charges concerning poisonous and deleterious substances, 16 involved charges concerning contamination, and 2 involved charges concerning economic and labeling violations.

No. 14; Apr. 1975). Subsequently, the claimant of the milk and the dealer mutually released one another from any claims with respect to the spaghetti and stipulated that the dealer's appearance and an swer be withdrawn. The stipulation was consented to by the Government and approved by the court. The Government (treating the motion to intervene as a nullity) moved for a default decree condemning the article. The court entered a de fault decree of condemnation and destruction, stating that no person had interposed a claim to the spaghetti, and noting: \"the motion to intervene led on January 7, 1975, not as a matter of law constituting a claim pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 334 and Supplemental Rule C(6), Federal Rules of Civil Proce dure.\" The dealer moved for reconsideration of the court's rul ing that his motion to intervene did not institute a claim and continued to litigate a claim and continued to litigate the dis position of the funds deposited with the court to cover the cost of removal and destruction of the milk. The destruction of the spaghetti effectively mooted the seizure action regarding that article; and the litigation was terminated by the granting by the court of the dealer's motion for an entry of a decree of condemnation authorizing use of the deposited funds to coverthe costs of removal and destruction of the remaining goods.

The articles were claimed by the dealer-packagerwho stated that there was a pending Food Additive Petition to re-clear cyclamates, that it would be unfair and unreasonable to destroy the articles, and that the claimant was presently en gaged in trying to sell the articles in Canada, although the claimant would not and had not for many months sold any cyclamates or any products made from them. Subsequently, the claimant led an amended claim and answer, repeating that it would be unfair to destroy the articles and elaborating on the pending reevaluations of sodium cyclamate. Subsequently, the court granted a Government motion for summary judg ment, saying: \"This matter is before the Court upon the motion of the plaintiff for summary judgment. \"This is an in rem seizure action brought pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq. The Dykem Company has led an amended answer and claim alleging that there is presently pending before the Federal Food and Drug Administration a 'food additive petition' led by Abbott Laboratories which seeks to reestablish that cycla mates, the item sought to be destroyed here, should be recer tied for human consumption. \"The afdavits attached to plaintiff's motion for summary judgment clearly establish that the possibility of the recertica- tion of cyclamates as safe for human consumption is a specu lative matter at best. \"The remote possibility that cyclamates may be recertied for human consumption does not abrogate the fact that the Articles which are the subject of this action are subject to con demnation at any time since they have been illegally held for sale within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cos metic Act.

Ley, Jr., in complaint for declaratory judgment and injunction: that since 1957, the plaintiff was engaged in the manufacture and distribution of novobiocin anti biotic combination drugs (e.g., Panalba and Albamycin G.U.) which had been certied by FDA pursuant to certain antibiotic regulations, that sales of such products averaged more than $30,000,000 per year during the past four years, that on De cember 24, 1968, the FDA Commissioner published a notice of his intention to amend the antibiotic regulations to delete such products from the list of drugs acceptable for certica tions, because the National Academy of Sciences-National Re search Council (NAS-NRC) had found the products to be \"ineffective as a xed combination for the indications specied in the labeling\" and the FDA Commissioner had agreed \"that there is a lack of substantial evidence that each ingredient in the above combination contributes to the claimed clinical ef fect\"; that all interested, adversely affected persons were invited to submit any pertinent data bearing on the proposal within 150 days; that plaintiff requested an opportunity for an evi dentiary hearing for the issuance of any order preventing the continued marketing of such drugs, discussed with FDA the development of a suitable protocol for additional clinical test ing of such drugs, and obtained assurances from FDA that plaintiff could be heard prior to removal of the drugs from the market; that FDA had subsequently published procedural reg ulations concerning \"Hearing Procedures for the Issuance, Amendment, or Repeal of Antibiotic Drug Regulations\" which provided for hearings before an order became effective unlessthe FDA Commissioner made certain specied ndings con cerning the absence of controversy, or the need to deal with FDA Consumer / March 1976 / 31an imminent health hazard; that, at a May 1, 1969, meeting the FDA Commissioner told plaintiff that the FDA would re peal within 30 days the pertinent antibiotic regulations unless plaintiff voluntarily withdrew its seven products from the mar ket; that the Commissioner's stated justication for such sum mary action was his receipt of the NAS-NRC reports concern ing novobiocin and the high frequency of adverse reactions to novobiocin and his receipt of FDA's review of reports of side effects; that, when plaintiff advised that it would not volun tarily withdraw its products from the market, FDA repealedthe pertinent antibiotic regulations \"on the basis of the un warranted hazard\" in light of the lack of substantial evidence that the drugs would have \"the effectiveness they purport and are represented to have, and more particularly, that each in gredient contributed to the claimed clinical effect\"; that the FDA repeal of the pertinent antibiotics regulations was to be come effective 30 days from the date of its publication, al though adversely affected persons were permitted to le objec tions within 30 days \"stating reasonable grounds and requesting a hearing\"; that any such hearing would necessarily follow the removal of the plaintiff's products from the market; that the defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously; that defendants must provide plaintiff an opportunity for an evidentiary hear ing prior to removal of plaintiff's products from the market, when the basis for the removal is a brief report on each drug prepared by anonymous persons; that the repeal of the perti nent antibiotic regulations was based solely upon an assessment of the comparative efcacy of plaintiff's products; that revo cation did not rest upon any new evidence relating to the efcacy of paintiff's novobiocin combination drugs, and did not take into account: the products' effectiveness as xed com binations, the side-effectiveness as xed combinations, the side- effects being well within acceptable limits for antibiotics, the actual mechanical practice of prescribing antibiotics before the particular cause of a patient's infection is known, and the de lay or prevention by combination antibiotics of the develop ment of bacteria resistant to antibiotic therapy; that plaintiff would be irreparably injured, had exhausted all available ad ministrative remedies, and had no prompt, adequate, and effec tive remedy at law; that plaintiff, accordingly, prayed for a declaratory judgment; that the repeal of the regulations was null and void, and that the defendants be enjoined from acting in reliance upon such order of repeal and from refusing to certify plaintiff's novobiocin combination drugs; and that a preliminary injunction be entered pending determination on the merits. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA, a nonprot membership association including approximately 130 pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors) moved to le a memorandum as amicus curiae, since many of its member companies would be adversely affected by a proposed FDA action to remove 85 antibiotic combination drugs from the market and that this case raised basic legal issues as to proper procedures to be followed in removing antibiotic combination drugs from the market. Without objection of the parties, PMA also moved for leave to participate, in support of the plaintiff, in the oral argument of the action. Meanwhile, the court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining FDA from taking any enforcement actions againstthe plaintiff of the products involved. After argument by the parties before the court, the court denied the defendants' mo tion and issued a preliminary injunction against the defendants, enjoining the enforcement of the revocation order until 30 days after the Commissioner had acted on the objection led by the Upjohn Co., and saying: \"It is claimed: that plaintiff is the only manufacturer of combination tetracycline/novobiocin antibiotic and the novo- biocin/sulfamethizole combination; that since the plaintiff rst marketed the tetracycline/novobiocin combination, under the name Panalba, in 1957, 750 million doses have been adminis tered to patients in the United States (Panalba is sold only in the United States); that other tetracycline/novobiocin com binations sold only in foreign countries have been widely used since rst marketed in 1958; that 450 million doses of Alba- mycin-T have been administered to patients and 44 million doses of Albamycin G.U. have been administered to patients;that the sale of these combination drugs represents a substan tial portion of the plaintiff's annual sales of pharmaceuticals. \"Plaintiff asserts that for many months it has been attempt ing to obtain from the defendants the names of the individual members of the NAS-NRC panels which made the adverse ndings as to the efcacy of plaintiff's drugs in which the Commissioner concurred. Up to the present time plaintiff has been given only the names of the Chairmen of the two panels involved, despite the fact that the evaluation reports as to plaintiff's drugs involved in this action made an adverse determination as to the efcacy of the drugs based upon the 'in formed opinion of the panel,' as well as a limited nuniber of medical journal articles and other material, most of which has been in existence since prior to 1960. \"Prior to the effective date of the order of May 15, 1969, plaintiff led with the Commissioner objections to the order. Defendants claim, in addition to denial of jurisdiction and venue, that the plaintiff has not exhausted the administrative remedies. This is adequately covered on page 14 of defendants' reply brief, where it is stated: Before granting interim relief,the agency must nd that justice so requires. The Commis sioner has stated to two Congressional Committees that he does not intend to grant interim relief in this case because of the unwarranted hazards in the use of the combination drug. \"At the time of the hearing on plaintiff's application for temporary injunction counsel for the Pharmaceutical Manu facturers Association, appearing amicus curiae, stated that by similar procedure the Commissioner had indicated an intention to remove all other combination antibiotic drugs from the market. \"There are four principal issues to be resolved by this Court: I. Does a District Court have jurisdiction over the in stant action and the parties? II. Is the venue for this action properly in the Western District of Michigan? III. Is the action timely for consideration by a District Court? and IV. Assuming that venue and jurisdiction are proper, that the action is timely led, what relief may this Court grant to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff is entitled to relief? JURISDICTION \"Defendants contend that under \u00a7 507(f) of the Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 of \u00a7 701(f), 21 371(f), are the provi sions of \u00a7 701(f) a District Court is without jurisdiction to re view an order of the Food and Drug Administration. Defen dants do not seriously deny that the plaintiff will suffer ir reparable damage by enforcement of the Commissioner's order of May 15, 1969. * * * \"The controversy in this case is not unlike that considered by the United States Supreme Court in Abbott [Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136 (1967)]. As in Abbott the drug manu facturer (Upjohn) is faced with enforcement of an agency order before it has an effective opportunity to seek to have the order reviewed pursuant to the provisions of the Act. As in Abbott there is here a serious question as to whether the defendants are attempting to exceed the powers granted by Congress to the substantial detriment of the plaintiff. In theinstant case the legal issues are in this respect two-fold. First, is the defendants interpretation of the information necessary to establish 'reasonable grounds' for a hearing under \u00a7 507(f) the proper interpretation; Second, is the assertion by the de fendants that the broad order here involved may be enforced prior to the time when a determination is made as to whether'reasonable grounds' exist for a public hearing justied under the terms of \u00a7 507(f). In considering these issues this Court is concerned only with their legal implications. \"After considering the pleadings, the briefs and the argu ments of counsel, it is this Court's conclusion that the instant action is a proper case for judicial review in its present pos ture. It appears obvious to this Court that the defendants seek to equate 'reasonable grounds' with 'substantial evidence' under the provisions of \u00a7 507(f), which presents significant issues of statutory interpretation. In addition the defendants have inter preted \u00a7 507(f) as permitting them to enter an order requiring 22 / March 1976 / FDA Consumerthe removal from the marketplace of antibiotic drugs prior to a determination as to whether a hearing need be held with regard to such order of removal when such drugs have for approximately 12 years been certied by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and efcacious and proper to be mar keted. This involves a further signicant statutory question since such action is not specically provided for under the provisions of \u00a7 507(f). Furthermore, defendants' interpretations are being imposed upon plaintiff in such a manner as to sub ject the plaintiff to potential irreparable damage, thus present ing a case which is 'ripe' for the exercise of the equity powers of this court. * * * \"This Court is satised that it has jurisdiction under the Act and under The Declaratory Judgment Act. . . . This Court is not concerned with any factual issues. The Court is satised that it should be concerned with and take jurisdiction over only the legal issues involved at a stage in the proceed ings when the plaintiff can have no opportunity for effectivereview of the administrative action prior to enforcement which will cause irreparable damage to the plaintiff. VENUE \"Defendants contend that if the District Courts of the United States have jurisdiction over actions such as the one with which we are here concerned this Court lacks venue under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1391. It is conceded by all partiesthat there is a split of authority among the cases in regard to this question. This split of authority was specically recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in Abbott Labo ratories v. Gardner .... The Supreme Court specically refused to rule upon the interpretation to be given \u00a7 1391(c) and \u00a7 1391(e), and in the remand of the case directed the Third Circuit Court of Appeals to consider the issue in depth. * * * \"The conflict amongst the courts and the commentators arises out of the meaning of the word 'resides' when applied to a corporate plaintiff. Some cases, including the only two Courts of Appeal which have ruled on the issue, and some com mentators, take the position that under the cited statute a corporate plaintiff's 'residence' is its place of incorporation only. Other cases and other commentators take the position that the changes in the venue statute indicate a Congressional desire to expand venue in cases involving corporate parties, and that the provisions of \u00a7 1391(c), insofar as the definition of residence therein contained is concerned, are applicable to corporate plaintiffs in \u00a7 1391(e)(4) cases. . . .\"* * * In the present case, though Upjohn is incorporated in the State of Delaware, it is conceded that plaintiff's prin cipal place of business is in the Western District of Michigan. * * * \"In conclusion, after a thorough review of the cases and comments for and against a liberal interpretation of \u00a7 1391(e) in the light of \u00a7 1391(c), this Court is of the opinion that it was the intent of the Congress to permit the bringing of actions against Government ofcers, employees and agencies in the place of 'residence' of the plaintiff, be it an individual or a corporation. To hold otherwise would create a paradoxical interpretation of \u00a7 1391(c) which would result in having cor porate residence mean one thing to a corporate plaintiff and something entirely different to a corporate defendant. . . .The Court takes judicial knowledge of the fact that many cor porations, large and small, are incorporated in the State of Delaware and have no other relationship to such state. To move the tremendous volume of suits against the Government a n d i t s o f c e r s f r o m t h e D i s t r i c t o f C o l u m b i a t o t h e D i s t r i c t of Delaware does not appear to have been the intent of the Congress. \" F o r t h e r e a s o n s h e r e i n s t a t e d t h i s C o u r t c o n c l u d e s t h a t venue in this case is properly in this District. T I M E L I N E S S O F A C T I O N \"Defendants contend that any judicial review is premature for the reason that the Commissioner has not yet made a determination as to whether Upjohn is entitled to a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 507(f), based upon the objections filed by Upjohnon June 14, 1969 to the Commissioner's order of May 15, 1969. * * *\"This Court has already determined that \u00a7 701(f) of the Food and Drug Act is not yet applicable to the instant con troversy. Therefore the statutory judicial review provisions of the Act cannot be invoked at this time, which leaves Upjohn without any adequate remedy in any court except as it may be o b t a i n e d i n t h i s C o u r t . \"This leaves for determination only the issue as to whether the May 15 order of the Commissioner constitutes a 'nal agency action.' This Court is satised that the action of the Commissioner is 'nal agency action.' The May 15 order can not be characterized as other than a 'nal order' in the light of the regulations promulgated on April 8, 1969, 34 Fed. Reg. 6238 .... In addition the defendants have argued in their briefs and in the hearing before this Court that the May 15 order goes into effect automatically at the conclusion of the 30[-]day period contemplated by \u00a7 507(f) of the Act and take the position that Upjohn is not entitled to an automatic hear ing on its objections to the order upon the ling of such objec tions. Under such circumstances it is impossible to view the May 15 order as anything but 'nal agency action.' To hold otherwise would be to ignore the pragmatic approach used in determining the existence of the 'nality' element in administrative actions. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, supra. * * * \"In the present case the Commissioner's action does not come within the purview of \u00a7 701(e) [of the Food and Drug Act] and there has been no stay in the enforcement of the order by the Commissioner. Indeed, the Commissioner con tends that Upjohn is not entitled to a stay under the statute and as previously set forth has stated in his reply brief that he does not intend to grant any interim relief. Consequently there is in the instant case an obvious threat of hardship and irreparable damage facing Upjohn if judicial relief is denied at this stage. \"For the reasons stated this Court is satised that there has been 'nal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court' and that the controversy is 'ripe' for judi cial review at this time. 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 704. Abbott Laboratories V. Gardner, supra. RELIEF \"In the determination of whether Upjohn is entitled to any relief under the statutes or to relief under the general equity powers of this Court the Court must resolve certain basic questions. \"First, is Upjohn entitled to an evidentiary hearing as a mat ter of right on its objections to the order of the Commissioner? Second, under the provisions of \u00a7 507(f) of the Act must the order of the Commissioner be stayed pending the hearing contemplated under \u00a7 507(f), assuming that such a hearing isheld? Third, under the general equity powers of the Court should Upjohn be granted a stay of enforcement of the May 15 order pending a determination of whether reasonable grounds for an evidentiary hearing have been submitted? The issues to be resolved are matters of rst impression in the Courts of the United States. * * * \"It appears to this Court from a reading of the briefs and pleadings that the position taken by the plaintiff has consider able merit. If such is the case then Upjohn should be fur nished an opportunity to produce 'substantial evidence' at a hearing on its objections. To any Court of law it would seem to be unfair to require Upjohn to submit all of its proofs by means of afdavits and the citations of various medical articles since many years of experience has demonstrated to all trial judges that the testimony of witnesses may serve the impor tant purpose of casting revealing light upon written material... . To this Court, unskilled in chemistry or medicine, it would appear that Upjohn's position, supported by afdavits and articles in medical journals, should present to the Commis sioner an issue as to the methods and materials used by the anonymous NAS-NRC panels in their determinations as to the efcacy of the plaintiff's products. We recognize, however, as previously stated, that the determination of 'reasonable grounds' for a hearing is one to be made by the Commissioner. * * * \"The legislative history of \u00a7 507(f) satisfied this Court that Congress did not intend the automatic stay of \u00a7 701(e)(2) to be a p p l i c a b l e t o a c t i o n t a k e n b y t h e C o m m i s s i o n e r u n d e r \u00a7 507(f). ... It appears from the Committee report 702, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4 (1945)] that it was intended FDA Consumer / March 1976 / 33that the Commissioner's order might go into effect prior to a hearing on objections led by persons affected by the order. * * * \"The fact that this Court has concluded, after full considera tion of the statutes, regulations, and the legislative history, that Upjohn is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing as a matter of right under \u00a7 507(f), and is not entitled to a stay of execu tion pending such a hearing, if such hearing is held, does not compel the conclusion that Upjohn is not entitled to some relief. Rather, the principles of equity, the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2201, may be invoked herein. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, supra. \"As previously noted an aggrieved party must le objections to the Commissioner's order stating 'reasonable grounds' in sup port of such objections. ... \"A cursory reading of the order makes it apparent that the Commissioner placed great emphasis, if not complete reliance, upon the adverse reports issued by the NAS-NRC panels with regard to Upjohn's combination antibiotic drugs. Despite the obvious reliance upon such reports, the Commissioner has con sistently refused to provide to the plaintiff the names of the men who wrote the adverse reports which formed the Com missioner's basis for the present order. * * * \"It is this Court's opinion that the Commissioner's obvious reliance upon the NAS-NRC panel reports and the requirement that Upjohn indicate specic criticism of the panel reports creates an untenable situation when the Commissioner is at the same time refusing to divulge the names of the panel mem bers (other than the Chairmen). . . . \"The specter of the heavy bureaucratic hand is heightened considerably when all of the surrounding circumstances are fully grasped. The Commissioner and the NAS-NRC panels are not acting upon the basis of any vital newly discovered information. There has been no nding by the Commissioner that the plaintiff's drugs present an im[m]inent hazard to the public health. In fact Panalba has been marketed since 1957 and has been legally certied by the Commissioner since 1956 as both safe and effective. Plaintiff contends that Panalba has been prescribed by more than 20 thousand physicians and that more [than] 750 million doses of this combination antibiotic drug have been prescribed. In fact all that has happened since t h e i n s t i t u t i o n o f t h e N A S - N R C p a n e l s i n 1 9 6 4 i s a r e - evaluation of existing data and information. * * * \"Based upon the information received and a full considera tion of the pleadings, the briefs and the arguments of counsel, it appears to this Court that Upjohn will be subjected to irre parable injury if the Commissioner's order of May 15 is per mitted to go into effect at this time. This Court is further satised that the plaintiff Upjohn has been placed in an unten able position by the Commissioner's obvious and complete reliance upon the 'informed opinion' of the unknown members of the NAS-NRC panels and their reports. The Commissioner attempts to justify this state of affairs on the basis of what is described by defense counsel as 'rational therapeutics.' The Court recognizes that the basic purpose of the Food and Drug Act is the protection of the public health. Counsel for the defendants would suggest that the plaintiff was required to and should have conducted 'controlled clinical tests' on a continu ing basis after approval of its drug as safe and efcac[i]ous in 1956. Such is not the requirement of the statute and the Commissioner has never until after December 1968 suggested to the plaintiff that such tests should be or would be required. It should be pointed out that it appears to the complete satis faction of this Court, based upon the statements of counsel for all parties, that the public health is in no way seriously threat ened by the continued marketing of Panalba, Albamycin-T and Albamycin G.U. Indeed the Commissioner himself has, in effect, reached the same conclusion as demonstrated by his failure to declare such drugs to be an imminent hazard to the public health. The fact that for 12 years these drugs (with the exception of Albamycin G.U.) have been declared both safe and effective by the defendants and have been marketed as such and have been generally and widely prescribed by competent members of the medical profession negates the idea that the public health will be in any way jeopardized if the Court grants to the plaintiff a temporary injunction. In reaching this conclusion the Court is cognizant of the fact that the Commissioner's action is not based upon any new evidence regard ing these drugs, their safety or their efcacy, but rather all the Commissioner's actions are based upon what can only be classi ed as reevaluation of previously existing evidence. \"This Court is, therefore, satised and concludes that nothing has been presented to suggest that the issuance of a temporary injunction will adversely affect the public interest.\" The Upjohn Co., on June 14, 1969, had led with the FDA Commissioner its objections to the regulations repealing the antibiotic certication of the novobiocin combination drugs, a statement of its grounds for its objections, and a request for an evidentiary hearing on the objections. The Comrnissioner pub lished a detailed review of the Upjohn Co. objections, con cluded Upjohn Co. had failed to show reasonable grounds for an evidentiary hearing, but authorized the Upjohn Co. to make an oral presentation to the Commissioner in which it could offer its analysis of the reported literature on which it relied and explain its theory as to why it believed reported chemical experience should be accepted as adequate medical support for its claims of effectiveness. Such oral presentation was made be fore the FDA Commissioner. The Upjohn Co.'s motion at the onset of the presentation was that the Commissioner be dis qualied. That motion was denied; and, after hearing the Upjohn Co.'s oral presentation, the Commissioner found that the medical documentation presented did not satisfy the re quirement of substantial evidence. The Commissioner also denied Upjohn's request for a hearing to present evidence other than adequate and well-controlled investigation, to satisfy the requirement of 'substantial evidence.' As described below, the Upjohn Co. sought judicial review of the decisions of the Commissioner. Petitioned 10-13-69 by The Upjohn Co., against H.E.W. Sec retary Robert H. Finch and FDA Commissioner Charles C. Edwards in suit for judicial review: that the court review the FDA Commissioner's September 19, 1969, order which revoked the novobiocin combination antibiotic certication regulations. The Upjohn Co. also petitioned for a stay of the order pending judicial review; and, with the consent of the parties, PMA led a memorandum in support of that petition for a stay. The Government committed itself not to act to enforce the order prior to ruling by the court on the motion for a stay of the order. The court advanced the hearing of the suit for judicial review, so that the motion for a stay and the petition for judi cial review could be heard together. The Court of Appeals afrmed the Government's order saying: \"Upjohn claims irreparable injury if the order goes into effect, pointing out that it has been selling $30 million worth of these drugs each year. It is asserted that the drugs banned by FDA have been on the market for 12 years, can be admin istered only upon the prescription of a physician, have proved to be commercially successful and millions of doses of them have been prescribed by physicians and sold to patients. Upjohn claims that it has presented to the Commissioner sub stantial evidence that the combination drugs are both safe and effective under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(d) and 357(h). \"Upjohn protests the provision of the order of the Commis sioner refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing on its claims. It complains that it was not afforded sufcient notice or time to prepare and submit evidence of adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations in support of its claims and that the regu l a t i o n s a r e v o i d u n d e r t h e A d m i n i s t r a t i v e P r o c e d u r e A c t , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553. Upjohn further contends that FDA Commissioner Herbert L. Ley, Jr., in testimony before Congressional com mittees, exhibited prejudgment and bias and was disqualied to act on the issue of the safety and effectiveness of these xed combination drugs. \"The Secretary and Commissioner respond by relying upon the purposes of the 1962 amendments, which they interpret as requiring FDA to review for effectiveness antibiotic drugs on the market at the time of the enactment of the amendments as well as any new drugs thereafter sought to be sold. The Commissioner contends that under the requirements of these amendments Upjohn must establish by substantial evidence its claims of the effectiveness of the drugs and that the degree of substantial evidence required by the 1962 Amendments, 21 34 / March 1976 / FDA ConsumerU.S.C. \u00a7 355(d) has not been produced; and that Upjohn was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing unless it rst came for ward with substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the drugs, based upon adequate and well-controlled clinical studies. FDA contends that Upjohn was given sufcient notice and time to prepare and submit evidence of adequate and well-controlled clinical tests in support of its claims. FDA takes sharp issue with Upjohn's contention that Commissioner Ley was disqualied from making a decision on the matters set forth in the FDA order [34 Fed. Reg. 14598, Sept. 19, 1969]. The issue of substantial evidence * * * \"Upjohn asserts that this standard of substantial evidence [21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 355(d)] applies only to new drugs considered by FDA for the rst time after enactment of the 1962 amend ments, and not to antibiotic drugs once certied by FDA as effective and already on the market. This Court is not willing to adopt such a narrow construction of the Act. We conclude that the legislative history and broad purposes of the Act demonstrate to the contrary. We hold that the interpretative regulations set forth in [34 Fed. Reg. 14,596, (Sept. 19, 1969)] correctly elucidate what Congress itself has plainly written in i t s d e n i t i o n o f s u b s t a n t i a l e v i d e n c e a n d c o n s t i t u t e a c o r r e c t application of the Congressional denition. \"It is further asserted by Upjohn that FDA could not apply the standard of substantial evidence to remove its products f r o m t h e m a r k e t b e c a u s e F D A h a d n o n e w i n f o r m a t i o n o r evidence with respect to the drugs in question at the time the c e r t i c a t i o n s w e r e r e v o k e d . T h e r e c o r d d e m o n s t r a t e s t o t h e contrary. At the time he revoked the certications the Com missioner had before him the unanimous conclusion of thirty experts in antimicrobial therapy that the products in question a r e i n e f f e c t i v e a s x e d c o m b i n a t i o n s . A n u m b e r o f o t h e r d o c u ments in the record, including some of the data submitted by Upjohn, reflect information which became available after these drugs had been certied by FDA and after enactment of the 1962 amendments. * * * \"The legislative history of the 1962 amendments recognizes that medical science is not static. The history of medicine is lit tered with once favored but now discarded remedies. The gen eral fund of knowledge has advanced to a point where experts are equipped to recognize the worthlessness of some drugs and remedies previously considered to be effective. \" W e c o n c l u d e f r o m t h e r e c o r d t h a t F D A h a d a d d i t i o n a l i n formation and evidence in 1969, when the certications were revoked, which were not available to it in 1956 when Panalba, a xed combination drug, was rst certied as safe and effective. \"Upjohn further contends that even if the standard of sub stantial evidence required by the act is applicable in the pres ent case, it has submitted such evidence to FDA in support of its claim. This evidence consists of 54 documents, all but one of which are in the record in this case. These documents, many of which are testimonial in nature, have been examined by the Court. We agree with the Commissioner that these documents do not reflect 'adequate and well-controlled investi gations, by experts qualied by scientic training and experi ence to evaluate the effectiveness of the drugs involved' as re quired by the statute. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 355(d). \"Finally on the issue of substantial evidence, Upjohn con tends that the effectiveness of its combination drugs has been established by their use under prescription of physicians and their wide acceptance by the medical profession over a period beginning in 1957. Upjohn asserts its Panalba products have been prescribed regularly by 23,000 physicians in the United States; that more than 750,000,000 doses of these products have been prescribed since 1957; that 450,000,000 doses of Albamycin-T products and more than 44,000,000 doses of Albamycin G.U. have been prescribed since 1958; that Upjohn is the only pharmaceutical manufacturer in this country that has produced these drugs in these combinations; that sales of these products have averaged more than $30,000,000 per year during the past ve years and account for more than twelve percent of Upjohn's total annual pharmaceutical sales; and that FDA has certied more than 2,400 batches of these prod ucts as safe and effective. \"It is contended that the public is adequately protected because these drugs can be sold only on the prescription of a physician. * * * \"The above quotations, [of Commissioner Ley, President Kennedy, Senators Kefauver & Hart, Fortune Magazine, N.Y. C o m m i s s i o n e r B a u m g a r t n e r, a n d C o n g r e s s m e n D i n g e l l & Fogarty, concerning doctors and drug advertising] together with other parts of the legislative history, demonstrate the Congressional intent that 1962 amendments were enacted for the assistance of practicing physicians as well as for the pro tection of patients. \"Sir Austin Bradford Hill, a distinguished British scientist, once said: 'In medicine, theories and therapeutic practices, in cluding those espoused by the majority come and go. One gen eration bleeds the ill, another scoffs at bloodletting. One gen eration insists on prolonged bedrest, another preaches the dangers of immobilization and the benets of early ambula tion for everything from surgery to cardiac infarct. * * * There thus can be no sense of condence automatically generated by \"traditional\" practice; in therapeutics, as in many other areas of human endeavor, there is no magical safety in numbers.' S.Rep. 1153, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 199 (1966). \"We hold that the record of commercial success of the drugs in question, and their widespread acceptance by the medical profession, do not, standing alone, meet the standards of sub stantial evidence prescribed by 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 355(d).

We already have ruled that the 54 documents submitted by Upjohn do not meet this standard of substantial evidence.

Ley, Jr. FDA Consumer / March 1976 / 35was disqualied to issue the order . . . because of statements made by him before two Congressional Committees during May 1969. * * * \"Our examination of his testimony before the two Congres sional committees convinces us that the Commissioner was not disqualied and that Upjohn was not deprived of an im partial decision by the hearings before the two Congressionalcommittees or by an intrusion of the committees into the ad ministrative process before entry of the nal order. \"All other contentions made in support of the petition to review have been considered and found to be without merit.\" (Misc. No. 124; N.J. No. 49) Warning concerning oral hypoglycemics and injuries sustained by the publication of such warning, suit for damages, Honolulu, Dist. Hawaii. Charged 11-24-72 by Moses Hanohano (a diabetic), Honolulu, Hawaii, against the U.S.A., the Department of H.E.W., and the Food and Drug Administration: that the plaintiff became aware of FDA's announcement that oral hypoglycemics were dan gerous and accordingly discontinued taking oral hypoglycemics; that, in publishing such announcement, the defendants negli gently failed to evaluate material facts; and that, as a result, plaintiff had sustained permanent and painful injuries. The Government denied the charges and served written interroga tories on the plaintiff. The Government moved for summary judgment arguing: (1) that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted since the FDA warning was to physicians and not to plaintiff, who relied, not upon the document, but on local newspaper reports and conversations with friends, and who had discontinued taking Orinase volun tarily and contrary to his personal physician's advice; and itwas FDA's statutory duty to communicate medical information to members of the medical profession; (2) that the court lacked jurisdiction by reason of the \"misrepresentation\" exception of the Federal Tort Claims Act; and (3) the court lacked jurisdic tion by reason of the \"discretionary function\" exception of the Federal Tort Claims Act. The court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment saying: \"The government's motion for a summary judgment, as out lined in the argument, is based upon: [First,] there was no legal duty on the part of the government to Hanohano, the plaintiff here, under the circumstances; Second, that the gov ernment is relieved of all liability, if any there may be, under both the exceptions contained in the misrepresentation aspect and the discretionary function aspects of the government's actions in the instant case. * * * \"Now so Mr. Moses Hanohano has diabetes and he's under the care of a doctor and somehow he hears something in re gard to the government report concerning the oral hypogly cemic which Hanohano was then taking under a doctor's order \u2014 h e l e a r n e d i t i n O c t o b e r o f 1 9 7 0 . W h a t e v e r i t w a s h e learned, from whatever source that he learned it, he quit taking oral hypoglycemics for a couple of months or so and then he went to his doctor because things weren't going so well under just a straight diet, and subsequently this action was taken. * * * \"As outlined in the complaint, ... the basis of the claimed liability of the government was that the government had initiated a study and supplied some of the funding and had received reports .... \"The report of the government to the physicians was simply an objective analysis, as the Court sees it, of the study itself and, ... the report indicated that the U.G.D.P. [University Group Diabetes Program] had found that the use of oral hypo glycemic drugs was associated with a statistically higher rate of cardiovascular mortality than diet alone or diet and insulin i n t h e t r e a t m e n t o f a d u l t o n s e t d i a b e t e s f r o m w h i c h M o s e s Hanohano was suffering; and the FDA notication recom mended to physicians that the use of oral hypoglycemics be limited to patients with adult onset diabetes mellitus which could not be adequately controlled by diet alone or diet and insulin. \"Obviously, the whole impact of that was intended to be evaluated by physicians, not by patients, because the recom mendation was that the physicians' use of Orinase or any other oral hypoglycemic be limited to a certain type of patient undercertain conditions; so that I agree with the government on the rst ground of their motion that there was no legal duty here on the part of the government to Moses Hanohano. The gov e r n m e n t h a d n o t d i r e c t e d i t s c o m m u n i c a t i o n t o M o s e s H a n o hano, and if he was ever to get it, it was expected by the communication itself that it would come through a physician. So that under the circumstances ... on the ground that there was no legal duty set forth in any of the facts\u2014no legal duty to Moses Hanohano, I would sustain the government's motion for summary judgment, but I don't need to stop there and rest my decision solely on that point. \"The second point is that this involves the misrepresentation based as it was, according to the plaintiff, upon the report of a committee appointed by the FDA to consider and evaluate this study, and that the evaluation was done negligently. The mis representations this Court would hold which followed that study\u2014presupposing they were misrepresentations, presuppos ing they were based upon a negligent evaluation by the com mittee appointed by the FDA to consider and evaluate the study . . . were those which would fall within the exception under the Tort Claims Act. The misrepresentations, contrary to the plaintiff's contentions, are not limited by Neustadt [366 U.S. 696 (1961)] to commercial and nancial misrepresenta tions only. The cases cited by the government indicate that there are other areas in which the same exception is applied and it has no direct bearing upon commercial or nancial mis representations. * * * \"And so I would hold on the second ground on the deci sions\u2014Neustadt and others\u2014that this case falls within the misrepresentation exception of the Tort Claims Act. Likewise, on the third ground\u2014I don't rely on that alone either\u2014that on the third ground that this was a discretionary function exception. Counsel for the plaintiff has argued that this was an operational decision\u2014this was not an operational decision at the high level as was the situation [in Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15] ... because, as the Court viewed it, the [FDA] had its committee which evaluated the results of the study; and, based on that evaluation, a high level decision was made to inform the physician of the reported results of the study; not to inform every individual who now had adult diabetes that he should forthwith at once cease and desist from taking the pills. This was a high level decision even in the denition of the plaintiff, and it falls, therefore, within the discretionary exception of the act itself. There was here none of the situa tion where there was an established recognized and underlying duty on the part of the government to Hanohano. It was a new drug, there had been a study and there were reports made, as under the statute, by the U.G.D.P. of what was going on and the reports were of such a nature that the [FDA] . . . passed along the information contained in the study to the physicians; and that decision to pass it along under the circumstances here was a 'planning decision' and it was a discretionary matter; and the [FDA] actions fell within the discretionary function exception of the Act. The motion for summary judgment on any or all of the three grounds specied by the government is granted. Prepare the order.\" (Misc. No. 206; N.J.
