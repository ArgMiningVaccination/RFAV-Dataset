Accel at Crystal Park is excited to announce the selection of Walgreens to serve as our healthcare partner in administering the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Trained Walgreens pharmacists and immunization technicians will be doing the injections onsite and at no cost to the recipient. We are working hard to protect our residents and staff as we continue to fight this pandemic - and soon, we'll take a huge step forward with onsite COVID-19 vaccines. As a standard procedure, individual consent must be given before every vaccination. However, on the behalf of patients with dementia and other cognitive challenges, family caregiver consent forms are now available for download and from the front desk during normal business hours. The exact timing and volume of the vaccine that will be arriving at our facility remains unclear. And while we do not yet have the vaccine, we do need to be prepared for when we do receive it. We ask that all caregiver consent forms be returned to us as soon as possible by U.S. Mail or hand delivered to the front desk. You may also fax it to: 405-635-9962, or send it by email to: [Administrator@accelcrystalpark.com](mailto:Administrator@accelcrystalpark.com) & [DON@accelcrystalpark.com](mailto:DON@accelcrystalpark.com). We anticipate being able to begin the resident vaccinations the week of December 28, 2020. "}
