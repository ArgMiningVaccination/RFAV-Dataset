He also received his medical degree from Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine. Dr. DiDonna has been practicing as a Family Medicine specialist since 2011 and has been a state-certified Medical Marijuana physician since 2017. Having started his post-graduate with a background in Health Education, Dr. DiDonna understands the importance of teaching others about their health issues and treatment options. He believes this empowers the patient, allowing them to make informed decisions when it comes to developing your plan of care. His compassionate nature and dedication to promoting health and wellness in each of his patients, has laid the foundation on which New Age Medical Associates was built. New Age Medical Associates was founded in 2018 by Michael DiDonna, D.O. as an alternative to the impersonal and inconvenient 'conveyor-belt' style of medicine that seems to be taking over the healthcare system. We provide unhurried, personalized care and convenient, concierge (house-call) services. Our medical practice is dedicated to guiding our patients towards achieving their highest sense of wellness and overall quality of life. All services are by appointment and subject to physician availability. 1730 S Pinellas Ave Suite J, "}
