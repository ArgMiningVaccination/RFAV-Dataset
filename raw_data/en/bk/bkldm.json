Specifically, this refers to a supply chain that includes the handling, transportation, and storage of temperature -controlled produ ct. For vaccines the recommended temperature -controlled range is between a National Immunisation Office - NIO-02 Version 3 - Apr 2020 Page 5 of 17 minimum of +2Celsius and a maximum of +8Celsius (+2C to +8C). Conditioning of ice packs/gel packs: The process of leaving ice packs/gel packs at room temperature to allow the ice or gel at the surface of the pack to defrost and the ice core to move freely within the pack, surrounded by a melted layer. This minimises the risk of freezing the vaccines. NCCS : National Cold Ch ain Service. NIO: National Immunisation Office. Vaccine : Any preparation intended to produce immunity to a disease by stimulating the production of antibodies. Vaccines include, for example, suspensions of killed or attenuated microorganisms, or products or derivatives of microorganisms. 11.0 Roles and Responsibilities 11.1 Roles Managers to ensure that all members of staff involved in immunisation are aware of the SOP. Managers to ensure that all members of staff involved in immunisation comply with the SOPs through monitoring, audit and review. HSE staff involved in immunisation to be aware of and follow the SOPs. 11.2 Responsibility The SOPs should allocate overall responsibility for cold chain management to a designated person(s). However, each vaccinator is responsible for ensuring that the vaccines they administer have been correctly stored and are in date . The cold chain management SOPs should be dated and signed by relevant staff and reviewed on an annual basis. 12.0 Standard Operating Procedures All vaccines are sensitive to heat, cold and light and must be kept at temperatures between +2C and +8C . Vaccines stored outside this temperature range or exposed to either UV or fluorescent light can result in the loss of potency (see Appendix I V). National Immunisation Office - NIO-02 Version 3 - Apr 2020 Page 6 of 17 Domestic cool boxes should not be used to store, distribute or transport vaccines . 12.1 Cool box and ice packs /gel packs specifications Solid walled or vaccine specific soft walled insulated cool boxes and ice packs/gel packs must be used. i. The cool box must have a probe inside of it, which is linked to the temperature display on the outside of the cool box. This external display allows the temperature where the probe is located to be monitored without opening the box. For details on placing the probe with vaccines in the cool box see Section 12.3 point vi. ii. The thermometer display should be accurate to +/ - 0.5C (or better) and be supplied with a certificate of calibration. Note: Where temperature display is not built as part of the cool box a minimum/maximum temperature monitor or a data logger with a probe attached to an extended wire placed inside the cool box can be used. iii. A data logger should be used in the cool boxes where external temperature display records only current temperature . This will provide an accurate account of temperatures reached and the duration of any temperature breach. The information on the data logger can be downloaded at the end of a vaccination day to confirm that any returned vaccines have remained within temperature. A data logger does not replace the need to check cool box temperatures each time when removing vaccines prior to administration . iv. Ice packs or Gel packs a) Ice pack is a plastic container filled with water /chemicals and must be stored in accordance with manufacturers' instructions in a freezer. It should never be in direct contact with the vaccines as it will freeze the vaccines. Sufficient barrier layer of insulating material (e.g. bubble -wrap or polystyrene chips) must be used to prevent freezing . b) Gel packs contain chemicals that depress the freezing point of the pack so that the gel remains co oler than 0C for a long period . There are refrigerated and frozen gel packs which are National Immunisation Office - NIO-02 Version 3 - Apr 2020 Page 7 of 17 refrigerated at +2C to +8C and frozen in a freezer respectively. The conditioning process of gel packs (described in section 10.0 ) vary depending on the type. The risk of freezing of vaccines in cool boxes increases if gel packs are not correctly conditioned . Note: For all packing materials and equipment, ensure that the specifications of each item are adhered in accordance with the manufacturer guidelines . Each site should have SOPs on how to pack a cool box with the ice/gel packs and vaccines. The risk of freezing of vaccines in cool boxes increases if ice/gel pack s are not correctly conditioned or separated by insulating material . 12.2 Cool Box Maintenance It is important to test and validate the method of packing vaccines by simulating the process and recording the cold chain for a similar period required for a typical transportation and clinic duration. The box does not cool. It relies on cool/ice packs to maintain the correct temperature of +2C to +8C. In the cool box, air does not circulate to create an even temperature zone therefore the temperature needs to be monitored at regular intervals by the user via the external display. The number of ice packs/gel packs required depends on the following variables: i. Quality characteristics of cool box and ice packs/gel packs. ii. Temperature and volume of ice packs/gel packs . iii. Volume of the vaccines and volume of the cool box - is the box full or is there a lot of space in the box? iv. External temperature - the warmer the ambient temperature, the more rapidly the internal temperature will rise because the cool box is only an insulation that separates the vaccines from the temperature outside. If the box is being transported in the boot o f a car on a warm day it will require more cool/ice packs than if it were a very cold day. v. The distance and time in transit and the duration of the clinic. vi. The number of times the lid will be opened and closed, as each opening will raise the temperature. National Immunisation Office - NIO-02 Version 3 - Apr 2020 Page 8 of 17 12.3 Vaccine Storage and Monitoring Vaccines must be stored in pharmaceutical fridges at the HSE vaccine storage site in accordance with the local Vaccine Fridge Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The best assurance of vaccine efficacy is to minimise the number of times vaccines are handled and transported. If vaccine transportation to another location is required, it is critical to maintain the cold chain at all times. Cool box temperature should be maintained between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C at all times . i. Check the temperature of the vaccines being transported (i.e. fridge temperature) ii. Use the number of ice packs/gel packs as per cool box manufacturer's instruction s and local SOP . iii. Place the ice packs/gel packs in the cool box for a minimum of 15 minutes (or as per manufacturers recommendations) before the vaccines are packed into the cool box. iv. Ice packs/Gel packs must not come in direct contact with the vaccines. The packs must be sufficiently wrapped or separated by insulating material to prevent direct contact with the vaccines and to avoid the risk of freezing or the temperature to drop to less than 2\u00b0C. v. Position the ice packs/gel packs appropriately above, below and at the sides of the vaccines as space in the cool box allows (as recommended by the manufacturer and local SOP). vi. Thermometer probe (or data logger) should be placed in the middle of vaccines and should not touch ice packs/gel packs. To prevent probe from moving during transport, it can be placed in an empty vaccine box, placed in the mid dle of the vaccines. vii. Fill the empty space between the lid and the product with bubble wrap to provide an additional layer of insulation. viii. Shut the lid of the cool box tightly. ix. The vaccines must be transported in their original packaging. x. Only the number of vaccines estimated for administration on any particular day should be brought to the site. National Immunisation Office - NIO-02 Version 3 - Apr 2020 Page 9 of 17 xi. Ensure the appropriate vaccines are packed which are in date and where possible from one batch . xii. It may be necessary to add/remove ice packs or gel packs as the temperature dictates. xiii. Record the temperature in the cool box ( See Appendix V for sample Temperature recording chart ): when v accines are packed upon arrival at the immunisation clinic throughout the immunisation clinic when returning vaccines to the fridge. Note: Freezing can occur in a cool box, and the risk is greatest within the first 2 hours after packing. Monitor and record the max/min and current temperature frequently for the first 2 hours. Where current temperature reading only is available, this should be done every 15 minutes. Where max/min readings are available and providing the temperature is not dropping to +2\u00b0C or lower, then less frequent recording is acceptable. Thereafter once temperatures are stable hourly readings of the external display should be recorded. xiv. The cool box should be placed in, An appropriately ventilated room, Away from any heat source, Away from direct sunlight. xv. The cool box should remain closed as much as possible. Only the amount of vaccine needed at one time should be removed for preparation and administration. The temperature inside the cool box must be monitored. xvi. If there are any unused vaccines remaining at the end of a vaccination session, providing that the cold chain has been maintained, the vaccines can be returned to the vaccine fridge. They must be marked and should be used first on their next vaccination session. If these marked vaccines are taken to a second vaccination session and are not used -they can be returned to the vaccine fridge , and administered at the next clinic provid ed the cold chain has been maintained . xvii. Record the t emperature of the vaccine being returned to the vaccine fridge and the time of return (Appendix V). National Immunisation Office - NIO-02 Version 3 - Apr 2020 Page 10 of 17 xviii. The cool box thermometer should be calibrated on an annual basis. A validated cool box provides ongoing assurance that the vaccines will be maintained within the cold chain temperature range during transport. With time and use, cool boxes and ice packs /gel packs may no longer be able to maintain the temperature range for extended periods so monitoring is always required. The cool box manufacturer should also provide sufficient evidence for assurance that a stable temperature within the range of the cold cha in can be maintained for several hours. xix. Vaccines exposed to either UV or fluorescent light can lose potency . Any vaccine that has been removed from its packaging should be used within the time specified in PIL/ SmPC . It should not be returned to the cool b ox but discarded safely into a sharps bin. The s harps bin should be securely sealed when three -quarters full or filled to the manufacturer's fill line. xx. Reconstituted vaccines lose potency even when stored between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C. The potency loss depends on the vaccine and the length of time since reconstitution. For manufacturer's recommendations after reconstitution refer to PIL /SmPC . xxi. If temperatures outside the permitted range are recorded, first check the position of the temperature probe. The temperature probe should be in a vaccine box in the middle of the vaccines - if it is not correctly positioned reset the probe and ensure it is positioned corr ectly away from ice packs or at the lid of cool box then close the box firmly and recheck the temperature in 15 minutes. xxii. If the temperature is still outside the permitted range , place the vaccine under quarantine in the fridge , and contact the NIO for further advice (see Appendix VI for contact details) . The NIO will carry out a risk assessment and will advise on a case by case basis whether it is appropriate to use the vaccines or whether they should be discarded. xxiii. Do not use or dispose of any vaccine which has been exposed to temperatures outside the permitted range. Quarantine and maintain these vaccines between +2 \u00b0C and +8\u00b0C until advised by the National Immunisation Office.

D The actions to be taken if the temperature falls outside +2C to +8C (i.e. breakdown in the \"Cold Chain\")? National Immunisation Office - NIO-02 Version 3 - Apr 2020 Page 15 of 17 Appendix IV: Cold chain breaches and Light exposure Vaccines are delicate biological substances that can become less effective or destroyed if they are: frozen stored above +8C exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet (UV) light, including fluorescent light. The cold chain (storage between +2C and +8C) begins at the manufacturing plant, extends to the transport and delivery of the vaccine and correct storage at the provider facility, and ends with administration of the vaccine to the patient. If the cold chain is not maintained, vaccine potency and effi cacy may be reduced or lost, resulting in administration of a sub -optimal vaccine. This can require revaccination of patients which will increase cost for providers/ taxpayers and damage t he public confidence in vaccines. Cold Chain Flowchart - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2019). Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit. Exposure to conditions outside the parameters of +2C to +8C can affect potency of vaccines, but a single exposure to freezing temperatures (0 C or below) can destroy pote ncy. NOTE: Vaccines should be kept in fridge/cool box in their original packaging until they are administered, to prevent damage from light and ambient temperature.
