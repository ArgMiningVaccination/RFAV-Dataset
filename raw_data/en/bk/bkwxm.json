I came to the path of medicine, as many do, through the search for my own healing that would allow me to recover from an arm injury and enable me to continue my career as a professional guitarist. Music has always been my passion and devotion, having studied a bachelor in music and having played guitar around the world on cruise ships. Towards the end of my studies in Chinese medicine, and to my amazement, my arms began to feel strong enough for me to play professionally again. More importantly, however, through the whole healing process, I developed much more compassion and care for the suffering that we all experience from time to time, be it psychological, physical, or spiritual. It's my privilege and profound intention to help to ease the pain, and facilitate the healing of those who connect with me in this path.
