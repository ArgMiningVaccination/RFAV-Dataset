Janet's story My interest in Chinese Medicine began in Nanjing, China, in 1983, where I was taking Chinese Studies as part of the International Studies program with Duke University . After my return to the U.S., I began experiencing severe, chronic headaches, and decided to explore acupuncture after exhausting my options with allopathic medicine. The acupuncture therapy I received beginning with my first appointment, gave me a needed relief I haven't had in more than a year. I felt this alternative therapy could be beneficial to many people, and was motivated to enroll in acupuncture school. In the year 2000, I graduated with a Masters in Acupuncture from the Traditional Acupuncture Institute (TAI), now known as the Maryland University of Integrative Health. Furthermore, in 2005, I completed a two year training in Chinese Herbal Medicine. I practiced acupuncture for 12 years in Washington D.C., and after a 4 year hiatus in my husband's home country, El Salvador, Central America, we settled in rural Pennsylvania. I had an opportunity to take over the practice of a former TAI classmate in Hagerstown, Maryland, and have been working here since. My practice in Hagerstown has been extremely rewarding, introducing me to the various challenges patients in this region are facing. Some of these are similar to Washington DC and El Salvador and some, such as Lyme Disease are more prevalent here. I feel honored at having the privilege to accompany my patients in their quest for healing and well being. Janet W. Smith "}
