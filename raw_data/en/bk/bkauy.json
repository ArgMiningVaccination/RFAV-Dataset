They protect the health of individuals and communities everywhere and protect our global economy and countries' stability. Today, the need for robust immunization programs and research is more evident than ever. Sabin's 2019 progress forged powerful connections between leading decision makers across the realms of science, business, policy, public health and philanthropy - ensuring that life-saving vaccines can reach the families that need them, when they need them. OUR MISSION IS TO MAKE VACCINES MORE ACCESSIBLE, ENABLE INNOVATION AND EXPAND IMMUNIZATION ACROSS THE GLOBE. Annual Report 20193LETTER FROM THE CHAIR AND THE CEO Reducing the impact and consequences of preventable disease. Bolstering health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Investing in those who defend our health. Preparing for and responding to epidemics and pandemics. These objectives, which lie at the heart of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, were recently identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) among the next decade's most urgent challenges. With established leadership, powerful partnerships and a new strategic foray into the vaccine development pipeline, Sabin is acting to meet these challenges through advancements in strengthening global immunization programs and research and development (R&D). \u00bbWe completed the transformation of Sabin that was initiated five years ago, which included new institutional management, new Board leadership and an updated organizational strategy with an enhanced focus on vaccine R&D and new initiatives in vaccine advocacy. \u00bbWe launched an R&D initiative and licensed promising vaccine candidates to prevent Ebola and the related Marburg virus. With diverse partnerships, Sabin aims to bring these vaccines through clinical trials with the ultimate goal of protecting the health of millions at risk. \u00bbWe applied insights from immunization professionals on the challenges they face to help shape Boost , a new community that enables immunization professionals to connect with peers and experts, learn skills that build capacity and advance careers, and lead immunization programs in challenging contexts. \u00bbWe generated and shared data on the burden of typhoid from our surveillance study in Asia to help spur momentum to prevent typhoid and inform Pakistan's decision to introduce a new typhoid conjugate vaccine into its routine immunization program. \u00bbWe awarded grants to improve vaccine acceptance , supporting research teams in India, Sierra Leone and Uganda to pilot targeted, community-based social and behavioral Axel Hoos, M.D., Ph.D. Chair, Board of TrusteesAmy Finan Chief Executive OfficerAnnual Report 20194interventions, with the hopes that what we learn can be applied in similar settings around the world. The success of this initiative inspired an expansion in 2020. \u00bbWe published key recommendations to accelerate the development of a universal influenza vaccine by the Sabin-Aspen Vaccine Science & Policy Group. The Group's 2019 report featured \"Big Ideas\" to address the persistent threat of an influenza pandemic, which were then spotlighted by scientific, business and philanthropy leaders throughout the year. The Group then turned its attention to vaccine misinformation to develop actionable ideas for shifting trends toward vaccine acceptance, including on the critical battle ground of social media. Sabin's strength and agility were invigorated in 2019 by the onboarding of new leaders and investments by new funders. We welcomed four staff to the leadership team, who are directing R&D and community-level efforts, as well as four Board Trustees with expertise spanning vaccines, immunization and global health. We also fortified and diversified our funding base with government, private and institutional support. But we know our work is far from finished. COVID-19 is demonstrating how unprepared the world is for a pandemic and the central role that vaccines play in protecting families, communities, economies and our social fabric. It is heartbreaking to watch communities worldwide face lives lost, medical infrastructure crippled, and livelihoods and industries brought to a standstill. This follows outbreaks of more than a dozen infectious diseases in 2019, including backsliding on global progress against polio and measles. These are difficult reminders of the importance of our work, but Sabin is built for this challenge. We play a crucial role in connecting the dots between community-level professionals, vaccine scientists, behavioral researchers, health professionals and national and global policy makers to surmount the global health challenges we face today and capitalize on opportunities for progress in the decade ahead. Together, with your support, we are working to develop new vaccines and transform how vaccines reach and are embraced by communities worldwide. Whenever we help a life-saving vaccine move one step closer to the people who need it or give a family the confidence to say \"yes\" to their child's immunization, it is thanks to you. With gratitude, Axel Hoos, M.D., Ph.D. Chair, Board of TrusteesAmy Finan Chief Executive OfficerAnnual Report 20195 Sabin is committed to developing vaccines to prevent diseases that cause devastating health effects and death in low-income countries, but are not being adequately addressed by traditional vaccine developers. Our initial work focused on identifying and acquiring \"de-risked\" vaccine candidates of regional importance that have already demonstrated scientific promise. Our R&D strategy came to fruition in the summer of 2019 when Sabin launched a dynamic non-profit R&D initiative to accelerate the development of clinical-stage vaccines for Ebola Sudan and Marburg - vaccines that have tremendous life-saving potential, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Powerful Partnerships to Prevent Ebola and Marburg Deaths More than 2,000 people have died in the latest outbreak of Ebola Zaire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ebola Zaire, Ebola Sudan and the closely related Marburg virus together pose a threat to millions of people, killing half of the people they infect. Because these lethal diseases primarily impact the world's most vulnerable populations, vaccines to prevent them have limited value in commercial markets. In August 2019, GSK and Sabin entered agreements for Sabin to advance the development of prophylactic candidate vaccines against Ebola Zaire, Ebola Sudan and Marburg viruses, based on GSK's proprietary ChAd3 platform. Under the agreements, Sabin exclusively licensed the technology for all three candidate vaccines and acquired certain patent rights specific to these vaccines. We are now pursuing development of vaccines for Ebola Sudan and Marburg. Sabin received initial funding of $20.5 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Vaccines to Stamp Out the World's Deadliest DiseasesAnnual Report 20196Authority (BARDA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to support the further development of these clinical-stage vaccines. Also in 2019, Sabin established a partnership with the National Institutes of Health's Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to manufacture prototype ChAd3-vectored Ebola Sudan and Marburg vaccines to be used for further clinical evaluation and outbreak preparedness and to potentially protect military, first responders, health care and laboratory workers, and other at-risk populations. Paving the Way for Future Innovation Led by a new R&D team with more than six decades of combined experience ushering vaccines from the laboratory and into communities, Sabin stands poised to take on a critical role in ensuring that opportunities for vaccine innovation and life-saving prevention are realized. \"The Sabin Vaccine Institute's use of a single well-established platform for the Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg vaccines will help to expedite the clinical development process so that the vaccines are available more rapidly.\" Rick Bright, Ph.D. Director, BARDA Identified vaccine candidates with promising clinical performance Assembled advisory group comprising more than a dozen global vaccine and immunization experts Conducted landscape assessment to identify potential R&D candidates addressing diseases that cause devastating health effects in low- income countriesIdentify Candidates2017Our ProgressAnnual Report 20197Licensed the technology for prophylactic candidate vaccines against Ebola Zaire, Ebola Sudan and Marburg viruses and acquired certain patent rights specific to these vaccines from GSK Hired team to lead R&D, project management and non-clinical development Entered into Research Collaboration Agreement with VRC at NIAID to further develop the ChAd3 Ebola and Marburg vaccinesSecure Partners & Funding2018 2019 Secured a funding award of $20.5M (with options for an additional $107.5M) from BARDA to advance development of clinical-stage monovalent vaccines against Ebola Sudan and Marburg viruses through Phase 2 clinical trialsEntered into a $5.3 million agreement (with options up to $8.5 million) to manufacture Ebola Sudan and Marburg vaccines for VRC Aruna Sampath, Ph.D. Vice President, Project Management Rong Xu, Non-Clinical Development Roxana Rustomjee, M.B., Ch.B., Ph.D. President, Research & Development Commence and complete non-clinical immunization studies to generate immunoassay reagentsBegin technology transfer of immunoassays from VRC to contract research organization and complete assay qualification Produce pilot-scale vaccine to evaluate efficacy and immunogenicity in non-clinical models2020 Initiate Development Planned ActivitiesAnnual Report 20198 Launched in early 2020, Boost is building a community where immunization professionals are empowered to grow and lead in their careers and accelerate change in their communities. Formerly known as the International Association of Immunization Managers (IAIM), this new global community enables immunization professionals to connect with peers and experts, learn skills that build capacity and advance careers, and lead immunization programs in challenging contexts. Immunization professionals, particularly those in low- and middle-income communities, are the primary implementers and advocates for vaccine access and acceptance locally and globally. Supporting their growth as leaders and managers helps ensure their ability to meet their communities' needs and to serve as powerful vaccine advocates within their countries and beyond. By Immunization Professionals, for Immunization Professionals Led by a new director and expanded team, Sabin worked throughout 2019 to define a vision for Boost . We began by conducting a review of the global immunization capacity- building landscape, then engaging with immunization professionals on the ground to better understand the needs and challenges they face in the course of their work. These pieces informed the Boost model, which emphasizes building adaptive leadership skills to help immunization program staff thrive in often-challenging environments \u2014 and the importance of connecting with peers in similar roles.CREATING A COMMUNITY TO HELP IMMUNIZATION PROFESSIONALS LEAD Annual Report 20199A Unified Effort We are proud of the progress we've made in bringing partners and global stakeholders together around the common goal of empowering immunization managers. Partner engagement at both local and global levels is central to the design and sustainability of the Boost platform. Through collaboration and partnership, Boost is building capacity and community, sharing best practices and driving progress forward. In 2019, the Boost team spent significant time developing partnerships while on the ground in East Africa, including with the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa (WHO-AFRO), the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi). These partnerships will strengthen both online and in-person activities with an eye toward long-term program sustainability. While there is much work to be done, the launch of this community marks the beginning of a renewed opportunity to support immunization professionals and strengthen immunization programs around the world. Already, Boost is offering a powerful opportunity for immunization professionals to strategize together to minimize the disruption that COVID-19 is having on immunization programs and to anticipate the future introduction of COVID-19 vaccines. Visit the Boost community. \"Working in prevention is important to the community as a whole in order to decrease the burden of communicable disease outbreaks which often reflect the economic status of the country.\" Yusra Khalf Iraq (January 2019)\"My biggest professional achievement is leading a successful immunization programme in Malawi, which has resulted in the disappearance of many vaccine- preventable diseases, such as whooping cough, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, neonatal and measles.\" Geoffrey Zimkambani Chirwa Malawi (September 2019) \"A good immunization manager should always be updated on technology, planning, strategies and national policies, and should be able to adapt to any responsibility or assignment.\" Obert Silwimba Zambia (October 2018)Annual Report 201910Sabin's enhanced online offerings for immunization program staff are complemented by valuable opportunities for in-person connection and educational offerings, such as the 8th Ciro de Quadros Vaccinology Course for Latin America. This course, held in November 2019 in Buenos Aires, is the only Spanish-language vaccinology course tailored to the needs of immunization professionals and the sole advanced course in all of Latin America. As new vaccines are approved and vaccine-preventable diseases re-emerge, immunization professionals require enhanced training. Sabin's course brings local program staff together with experts to stay up-to-date on vaccine recommendations, best practices for immunization campaigns and successful strategies and funding mechanisms \u2014 fortifying their abilities to strengthen their communities and countries via vaccination. With nearly a decade elapsed since Sabin's first vaccinology course, we're widening our lens to consider how this work can be even more impactful in 2020 and beyond. Recognizing the need to strengthen and expand the global availability of vaccinology training, Sabin is collaborating with more than 20 other course organizers to develop and share best practices and apply innovative approaches to adult learning. Our vaccinology course honors the legacy of Dr. Ciro de Quadros, whose work with the Pan American Health Organization helped eradicate polio in the Americas and smallpox globally before he served as Sabin's Executive Vice President and Director of Vaccine Advocacy and Education. Dr. de Quadros passed away in 2014 but his belief in health as a fundamental human right lives on through the programs he created.

In the face of climate change and emerging drug resistance, the urgency to prevent typhoid has grown as a public health priority. By developing and disseminating evidence of the burden of typhoid, Sabin helps decision makers determine how best to use vaccines that are now available \u2014 particularly the new typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV). Sabin supports typhoid decision making through advocacy and research. We advocate for an integrated approach to prevent and control typhoid through Take on Typhoid , a partnership between the Sabin-based Coalition against Typhoid (CaT) and Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC). We pair this advocacy with the generation of data on the burden of typhoid through the community-level surveillance network that Sabin has built with partners in Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan. With this dual strategy, Sabin has played an active role in equipping national stakeholders with the information and resources they need to make informed immunization policy decisions. Powering Evidence-based Decision Making Sabin's Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP), a large, multi-country observational study establishing the burden of typhoid, with nearly 29,000 participants, concluded its third year of prospective disease surveillance in September 2019. Supported by SEAP data, along with WHO and Gavi policies enabling TCV introduction, Pakistan became the first country to introduce the vaccine into its routine childhood immunization program in November. By the end of 2019, 9.8 million children aged 9 months to 15 years were vaccinated in Sindh Province, where more than 10,000 people have been infected with extensively drug-resistant typhoid. COMMUNITY-LEVEL PARTNERSHIP TO TAKE ON TYPHOIDAnnual Report 201912 SEAP is also informing ongoing vaccine introduction considerations by Nepal (where field vaccine efficacy studies have demonstrated TCV to be over 80 percent effective in protecting against disease) and Bangladesh. Seeking a Better Way to Detect Typhoid When considering whether to introduce TCV, policy makers need to know the burden of disease across the country, including in resource-constrained settings where the use of costly and time-intensive blood culture diagnostics may not be possible. To address this limitation, Sabin launched new research in 2019, leveraging the SEAP network of local hospitals, laboratories and researchers to develop more cost-efficient mechanisms for conducting typhoid surveillance. To date, more than 800 households have generously agreed to participate in Sabin's Sero- epidemiology and Environmental Surveillance Study (SEES), which aims to evaluate new, low-cost and easily scalable methods for typhoid diagnosis and detection. The research team is validating tests on finger-prick blood samples and drinking water as potential approaches for measuring the burden of typhoid in a community. Sabin's integrated approach to epidemiological research serves as a model for informing country decision making on vaccine introductions.

In March 2019, the Coalition against Typhoid brought together more than 400 scientists, researchers, government officials, physicians, industry representatives and health organizations at the 11th International Conference on Typhoid & Other Invasive Salmonelloses in Hanoi, Vietnam, with a focus on eliminating the global burden of typhoid through locally driven solutions. Participants explored the latest research, advocacy tools and lessons to inform national, regional and global efforts to prevent and control outbreaks. Highlights included the unveiling of TCV efficacy data and robust discussion of strategies for effective vaccine introduction and evaluation. A special supplement with key research findings from the conference presentations was published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in 2020.GLOBAL ACTION FOR LOCAL IMPACT Annual Report 201914 Why do some families decide to have their children vaccinated while others delay and still others refuse? Understanding these behaviors is essential to increasing vaccine acceptance and provides the basis for Sabin's community-based social and behavioral research program, which invests in local researchers with deep understanding of their communities' immunization needs, barriers and challenges. To start to explore those behaviors, in 2019, Sabin launched the Social and Behavioral Interventions for Vaccination Acceptance Small Grants Program . This pilot program supports research teams in low- and middle-income countries to harness local insights to design tailored social and behavioral interventions for the purpose of improving vaccine acceptance. After receiving more than 50 submissions from 32 countries, Sabin awarded grants to teams in India, Sierra Leone and Uganda, who tested interventions designed for their communities over the course of eight months. Amplifying New Voices These grants amplify critical voices in the field \u2014 those living and working in low- and middle- income countries who are less likely to be included in large-scale research opportunities. Sabin's program also offers a potentially significant ROI: these lessons, shared from the front lines, can offer powerful insights that can inform approaches to increase vaccine confidence in communities across the globe. Sabin will continue to explore the impact of these small grants, both upon social and behavioral science and network-building within the broader immunization research community, including our Vaccination Acceptance Research Network.LOCALLY LED UNDERSTANDING OF VACCINATION DECISION MAKINGAnnual Report 201915Sabin launched a new, broader Vaccine Acceptance & Demand initiative in 2020 to address challenges to vaccine acceptance through research, education and collaboration. As part of this initiative, Sabin plans to support additional researchers to identify interventions for vaccine hesitancy in low- and middle-income countries, then disseminate their results for the benefit of others facing the same challenges. \"With funding support from Sabin, this study will inform us on how to design social-behavioral interventions to overcome vaccine hesitancy in order to contribute to achieving universal health coverage in Uganda and beyond.\" Doreen Tuhebwe, M.P.H. Research associate and field coordinator at Makerere University School of Public Health in Kampala, Uganda, whose team trained adolescent girls in Kampala who have received the HPV vaccine to advocate with their vaccine-hesitant peers. \"This project will allow us to listen to the voices of communities in hard-to-reach borderlands, to really understand what the barriers to immunization are, so that we can design immunization and engagement campaigns that reflect their realities and expectations.\" Luisa Enria, Ph.D. Lecturer in international development at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, partnered with the Kambia District Health Management Team in Sierra Leone to study barriers and opportunities to vaccine access and acceptance among rural populations situated along the borderlands of Sierra Leone and Guinea. \"For health workers to believe in vaccines is really important and through this project, what we are hoping to do is to understand what frontline health workers think about vaccinations, what their belief systems are, so that we can make sure that we can devise interventions that improve confidence in vaccines across all aspects of health systems.\" Gagandeep Kang, M.D., Ph.D. Executive director of Translational Health Science and Technology Institute in Faridabad, India, whose team assessed the level of vaccine hesitancy and health worker perceptions of vaccines in Nuh district of Haryana, where immunization coverage is known to be far below the national average. Annual Report 201916As social media platforms and public health advocates grapple with how to curb health misinformation and disinformation, Sabin is facilitating important conversations to uncover vital insights into vaccine acceptance and help ensure access to accurate scientific information. In September, the Sabin-Aspen Vaccine Science & Policy Group convened with thought leaders from social media platforms and behavioral and cognitive science to dig into the growing issue of vaccine hesitancy. Read the resulting \"Big Ideas\" and actionable recommendations in the Group's report .In November, Sabin and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine co-hosted Advancing Research on Social Media and Vaccine Confidence, a discussion among social media research experts and people with experience improving access to accurate vaccine information. Participants examined current and potential approaches used by social media platforms to mitigate vaccine misinformation, what social media researchers are learning about vaccine discourse and what questions still need to be answered. Critically, participants also explored how social media platforms and researchers can work together to answer these questions. FACTS MATTER: MAKING VACCINE TRUTHS \"GO VIRAL\" Annual Report 201917In spring 2019, Sabin launched a social media campaign to make public health personal by amassing a diverse set of stories, images and quotes from parents and caregivers who chose to immunize their children. Nearly 100 parents, scientists, medical professionals and politicians contributed their photos and testimonials, creating a powerful community articulating the importance of vaccine acceptance.GIVE YOUR KIDS A SHOT \"I want my children to be free from preventable diseases and I want the same for everyone in our community, especially the most vulnerable. Vaccination is a civic duty and part of being a responsible citizen!\" Serena Palumbo\"Just like car seats and bicycle helmets protect your child against deadly injuries, vaccines are the single best investment against deadly diseases.\" Donald Shifrin, M.D. \"I got my kids vaccinated because I want to do everything I can to protect them, and I feel fortunate to live in a time and place where we can call diseases preventable.\" Angie AndersonAnnual Report 201918 Today, we are witnessing how a pandemic can halt our interconnected world and devastate families, communities, regions, countries and our economic security. For scientists, the crisis provides valuable lessons for preventing future pandemics and strengthens the case for developing new vaccines as a key public health strategy. Sabin's Influenzer Initiative is engaging cutting-edge problem solvers to accelerate the development of a next-generation, universal influenza vaccine (UIV), with the vision of broader and longer-lasting protection against influenza viruses that circulate every year and those with pandemic potential. Uniting Diverse Leaders Behind an Ambitious Goal The Influenzer Initiative engages experts from different sectors and disciplines to find unexpected solutions to one of science's greatest challenges. Sabin challenges leading professionals from academia, government, industry, philanthropy, technology and beyond to think differently to uncover novel pathways and innovative approaches for overcoming long- standing barriers to UIV development. In 2019, we focused on the promise of emerging knowledge and tools across the scientific and technological enterprise and how to make their application for UIV development a reality. In April, Sabin and Wellcome Trust convened a Call to Action with diverse thought leaders to brainstorm and identify next steps to advance this kind of high-risk, high-reward research. BOLD THINKING TO ACCELERATE A UNIVERSAL INFLUENZA VACCINE Annual Report 201919At the world's largest scientific gathering of influenza experts, the Options for the Control of Influenza (Options X) conference, we put a spotlight on the recommendations laid out in the 2019 Sabin-Aspen Vaccine Science & Policy Group report . Participants in a Sabin-hosted stakeholder meeting shared insights on how to incentivize and realize scientific collaboration, data sharing and transformative funding. The report recommendations also were highlighted during the conference plenary on progress in UIV development. A New Paradigm for an Age-Old Problem Building on this collection of insights and recommendations, Sabin continues to convene bold thinkers from the physical, computational and engineering sectors with influenza vaccine experts to develop a Convergence Science Agenda for UIV. This work will highlight novel pathways to further stimulate the intellectual and investment capital needed to transform vaccine development and catalyze new discovery and innovation.

Though demand for a COVID-19 vaccine is unparalleled, widespread misinformation threatens to undermine the public trust that will be vitally necessary to ensure high levels of vaccine acceptance and save lives. Quality journalism is a powerful counter to the fake news forces of misinformation and disinformation, but faces growing challenges. Reporters, many of whom may have a limited understanding of the science of vaccines or immunization program issues, are strained by urgent news cycles. Meanwhile, social media enables myths and falsehoods to go viral. Sabin's Immunization Advocates program links reporters and editors with immunization and other health professionals who can serve as expert sources and help journalists report accurately on vaccines. We piloted this program with journalists in Romania and Moldova, where 25 and Thanks @sabinvaccine. I was inspired by the important work you are doing to promote life-saving vaccines in Eastern Europe and around the world.\" David Jarmul, blogger and communications professional Also in 2019, Sabin became a member of the Vaccine Safety Net , a global network of websites, established by the World Health Organization, which provides reliable information on vaccine safety.GETTING THE STORY RIGHT: CONNECTING JOURNALISTS WITH VACCINE EXPERTSAnnual Report 20192150 percent of people, respectively, do not believe that vaccines are safe. Following the workshop, nearly all of the journalists who participated said they were better prepared to report on immunization and planned to do so. A New Partnership to Equip Reporters Following an early 2019 launch and an initial pool of 33 experts speaking more than a dozen languages, Immunization Advocates was further bolstered by the establishment of a partnership with Thomson Reuters Foundation. Together, Sabin and the Foundation have developed a training curriculum for journalists. Sabin stands ready to work with journalists seeking expert, fact-based sources on vaccination with the planned geographic expansion of Immunization Advocates and new online resources throughout 2020.Annual Report 201922In April 2019, Sabin awarded the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal to Dr. Carol Baker for groundbreaking research on group B Streptococcus (GBS) that led to routine screening of pregnant women in the United States and many European countries, as well as her advocacy for maternal immunization. The annual award is given to a public health leader who has made extraordinary contributions in vaccinology or a complementary field. Dr. Baker is currently an Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics at McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Although we were unable to celebrate in person as a result of COVID-19, Sabin was pleased to award the 2020 Gold Medal to Professor Gordon Dougan and our first-ever Sabin Rising Star Award to Dr. Katherine Gallagher. THE ALBERT B. SABIN GOLD MEDAL \"In my pediatric residency, I saw newborns who developed devastating signs of illness, often at or within a few hours of birth and accompanied by respiratory distress. About one in four died... I wondered why. My persistent curiosity got indifferent responses from faculty so I began to study the timing, clinical signs and outcome of these infections, which turned out to be caused by a generally unrecognized human pathogen, GBS.\" Carol Baker, M.D., \"the Godmother of GBS prevention\" and adjunct professor of pediatrics at McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Annual Report 201923FINANCIALS As we continue to connect more people with the life-saving vaccines they need, we are grateful for your support.
