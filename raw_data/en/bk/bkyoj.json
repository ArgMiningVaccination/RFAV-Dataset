Ceremony Center for Healing was born out of a lucid dream in December of 2015. I had been living in New York City and working in fashion. I left my career in December of 2014 as it was no longer serving me. I spent 2015 healing myself, recovering from an intense career and uncovering my truest self. I focused on learning and growing and releasing. I studied with the Shipibo shamans in Peru; I learned herbalism; I complete a certification with the [Institute for Integrative Nutrition](https://www.facebook.com/NutritionSchool/); I dove deeply into my yoga and meditation practice. I had a dream that I was walking through a healing center in the building my grandfather built in the early 1950s. There were people hanging out in front connecting, a full class happening in the studio and I felt so much love and bliss as I floated over the space from above. I woke up the next morning and I just knew this was it. Six weeks later, I flew back to Colorado to start construction on Ceremony in the same space my grandfather created and coined \"Your Health Center.\" My grandfather constructed the building to house his pharmacy, with doctor offices upstairs, and he started the first ambulance service in Westminster. It was his intention to serve his community with health and healing, and now I was to take over the space and serve my community in health and healing in a more modern (or perhaps ancient) way. We opened our doors on July 11, 2016. We've been connecting with our community ever since. One of the key components of what we provide is the loving connection. We have a lounge upfront where people congregate before and after class to connect. Ceremony offers schedule full of yoga, meditation and tai chi classes and we offer incredible workshops all centered on healing and empowerment. We have kombucha on tap from Happy Leaf in Edgewater, and we sell Shine potions from Shine in Boulder. I feel totally blessed to do what I do. And I am grateful everyday for that Divine Dream that led me here today. Ceremony has been open for over two years and it still seems like a dream. I can't believe I get to do this every day and I can't believe how much I love the community that is building here. I never thought I would be a business owner and I definitely didn't have it in my sites that I would be running a Center for Healing. I suppose most of my life I couldn't see how important, how necessary, the types of things I provide would be. I had always followed my dreams, and when you follow your dreams you life a happy, successful life without hardship, right? It's an honor to be in the space my grandfather created \u2014 to continue on with the family legacy of being in service to the community and bringing health and healing to my neighbors. Everything in Ceremony is conscious and was created with intention. As soon as you walk through the old doors you can feel it. I am honored to bring the things that have and are healing and awakening me to others. I don't know how I would have come out of my life crisis without yoga, meditation and spiritual guidance I have received. Life is so beautiful but can be very difficult at times and I hope that what I offer helps people grow through the hardships and stresses in life. Ceremony Center for Healing is located at 7269 Lowell Blvd. in Westminster. For more information, visit "}
