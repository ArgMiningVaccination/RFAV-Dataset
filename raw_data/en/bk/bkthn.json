BSBT-GEN students have the flexibility to choose their internship location and area of focus from a provided list of opportunities available to the program. This could be in a scientific laboratory, a pharmaceutical or device manufacturing company, a technology and licensing office, or any department related to technology, clinical trials, or project management. Unlike a traditional research thesis, internships may be a project, hypothesis-based, or problem-based to allow for training in industry and biotechnology businesses. The internship provides students with an in-depth understanding of how research in the biomedical sciences and biotechnology is translated into practical applications such as new biology discoveries, designs, drugs, devices, and patents. The students will gain a competitive advantage as they gain real-world experience and valuable networking opportunities in the field. Upon completion of the internship, students will have a comprehensive understanding of their chosen field. Their experience could range from learning state-of-the-art techniques, production of data and analysis in a research laboratory to regulatory affairs, intellectual property, and venture funding. The students will have a deep insight into the challenges and opportunities in their chosen field and will be able to apply the policies and regulations that guide translational science. Depending on their interests and career plans, they will have a deeper understanding of the impact of biotechnology on the environment and public health, the molecular mechanisms of diseases, project management, and much more. Past students have gone on to earn their PhDs and MDs, have been placed in successful Healthcare companies such as Medtronic and Terumo, serve FDA as Consumer Protection Officers, and have gone on to continue their creative endeavors in healthcare in many other capacities.

Internships at CUChange include exposure to the data collection process, as well as training in data preprocessing and analysis in support of an individual project to answer a research question of interest.| Martin Breuss, PhD Our laboratory studies the phenomenon of 'genomic mosaicism' where some but not all cells within a tissue harbor a unique mutation. It is commonly understood in the context of cancers, where specific mutations within a progenitor cell may cause the disease. However, 'mosaic mutations' occur in every cell of our body during embryonic development and aging. Our laboratory is interested in understanding this phenomenon in terms of its general impact on human health and its origin during early development. Current projects include the following: 1) analysis of mosaicism of the parents that may result in the transmission of disease-causing mutations to multiple children (related to the recurrence risk of 'sporadic' disease); 2) analysis of 'neutral' mosaicism without any functional impact that marks the lineage of cells and allows us to reconstruct development\u2014a feat that is otherwise impossible in humans. We combine human genetics research where we collaborate with clinical researchers, molecular biology to develop and perform detection assays, and computational approaches to process and analyze a variety of generated data. |Eduardo Davila, PhD||The Davila Lab aims to understand the cellular and molecular signals that promote the generation of potent and long-lasting tumor-specific T cell responses.

Our work focuses on an important antioxidant enzyme, extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD), which is highly expressed in the lung and vessels under normal conditions and is impaired in diseases such as acute lung injury and pulmonary hypertension. We predominantly utilize a series of genetically engineered mouse strains with alterations in EC-SOD expression to test how EC-SOD modulates inflammation and vascular injury in disease models. Ultimately our long-term goal is to provide a foundation for the development of novel diagnostic tools and cell-targeted antioxidant therapies to treat life-threatening pediatric lung diseases including acute lung injury and pulmonary hypertension.| Huntington Potter, PhD |Dr. Huntington Potter is Professor of Neurology, Director of Alzheimer's Disease Program at the Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, and is Director of the CU Alzheimer's and Cognition Center at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Center.

We have many studies under which we have collected deep clinical phenotyping data related to metabolism (insulin action and insulin resistance), cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac imaging, vascular imaging and assessment, skeletal muscle assessment of blood flow and oxidative capacity, and functional parameters such as exercise capacity. The overarching question of our lab is to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of decreased cardiorespiratory fitness and early cardiac dysfunction in the setting of otherwise uncomplicated diabetes. A student working with us would have the opportunity to assist in the building of a bio repository of data in youth and adults with type one and type 2 diabetes, analysis of relationships and response to intervention among these different groups and ages, and optimization of data dictionaries and entry into the biorepository for optimal extraction.| Rebecca Schweppe, PhD |The focus of the Schweppe Lab is to define the role of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) in advanced thyroid cancer. FAK is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that has been most studied at the cell membrane where it transduces extracellular signals promote cancer growth and metastasis. Recently we showed that activated FAK localizes in a sub-compartment of the nucleus, the nucleolus, in thyroid cancer cells. The nucleolus is a major regulator of ribosome biogenesis, and ultimately protein synthesis, which are critical to drive the metabolic demands of tumor progression. Thus, our data raise the exciting possibility that nucleolar FAK plays a novel and key role in these nucleolar-mediated pro-tumorigenic functions. Our ongoing studies are focused on understanding how FAK regulates ribosome biogenesis and ultimately thyroid cancer progression and how to target this novel function.| Jordan Jacobelli, PhD |The Jacobelli lab focuses on how cytoskeletal remodeling regulates lymphocyte migration, activation, and effector functions in response to environmental stimuli during homeostasis and in disease settings such as autoimmunity and cancer. We use a combination of functional assays as well as in vitro reductionist approaches, including high-resolution spatio-temporal imaging of molecular dynamics and in vivo 2-photon microscopy to characterize immune cell behavior in physiological environments.| Kimberly Bruce, PhD |Kimberley D. Bruce, PhD, is an Assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes. After completing her PhD in epigenetics and molecular biochemistry, Dr. Bruce wanted to use her expertise to interrogate the molecular mechanisms driving lipid disorders. After more than a decade of research, she noticed many links between peripheral lipid metabolism, brain aging, and neurodegenerative disease. Despite the brain being mostly made of lipids, lipid homeostasis in the brain is poorly understood. Inspired by this, research in Dr. Bruce's laboratory is aimed at finding new mechanisms relating to lipid and lipoprotein processing in the brain that we can target to improve outcomes for previously incurable diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis\"| Jill Slansky, PhD |Dr. Jill Slansky's lab is interested in how cancer and the immune system interact on many levels, but mainly focus on how CD8 T cells recognize tumor antigens in people and animals| Kunhua Song, PhD |The research goal in our lab is to understand mechanisms governing cardiac development and pathogenesis using a combination of human induced pluripotent stem cells and animal models.

His team comprises computational designers, medical students, and the expertise of academy award winning stop motion animation studio LAIKA.| Sujatha Venkataraman, PhD |Dr. Venkataraman's lab research is focused on identifying novel therapeutic strategies for a fatal brain tumor in children called DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma). Treatment options for DIPG are limited as chemotherapy is largely ineffective and surgical resection is not possible due to the tumor's location in the pons, a region of the brain responsible for multiple vital functions like heartbeat and respiration. Ionizing radiation is the current standard of care for DIPG but provides only a temporary relief as the tumor becomes resistant to radiation at recurrence. Our lab is currently studying the radiation resistant mechanisms at the single cell level to identify new targeted treatments that are directed towards enhancing radiation efficacy in DIPG. In addition, Dr. Venkataraman lab have also been working on immunotherapy, both CAR-T cell and antibody-based therapies to effectively target DIPG, which is otherwise a refractory disease.| Tamara Terzian, PhD |Our laboratory focuses on studying the transcription factor p53, a key tumor suppressor that is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers.
