Steinour Amy Chronis (joined late) Members Absent : W.G. \"Jerry\" Jurgensen PUBLIC SESSION The Wexner Medical Center Board convened for its 4 1st meeting on Tuesday , February 8, 2022, in person at the Longaberger Alumni House on Ohio State's Columbus campus and virtually over Zoom . Board Secretary Jessica A. Eveland called the meeting to order at 1:0 2 p.m. As co -interim leaders of the Wexner Medical Center, both Mark Larmore, CFO, and Andrew Thomas, Chief Clinical Officer, were in attendance, but only Dr. Thomas served as a voting member for this meeting. Item for Action 1. Approval of Minutes: No changes were requested to the November 16, 202 1, meeting minutes; therefore, a formal vote was not required, and the minutes were considered approved. Items fo r D iscussion 2. Interim Co-Leaders ' Report : Dr. Thomas noted that, since the November meeting, Ohio had faced another surge in the COVID-19 pandemic, and he expressed sincere appreciation for the support the medical center had received from CAS (formerly Chemical Abstracts) and the Ohio National Guard. CAS allowed the medical center to open a drive through COVID-19 testing site in its parking garage, which allowed for the testing of more than 1,000 patients per day during the peak of the surge, which had since dropped down to around 200 to 300 patients per day. Meanwhile, members of the Ohio National Guard provided support mainly in non-clinical areas - delivering food trays, cleaning rooms, transporting patients and sitting at their bedsides. They also worked in the Emergency Department and helped at testing sites. Dr. Thomas and Mr. Larmore both commented that t he assistance the medical center received from the Ohio National Guard during this time was invaluable. Trustee John Zeiger requested that a resolution be drawn up honoring the service of the Ohio National Guard as well as Governor Mike DeWine for the role he played in making the guard members available. This resolution was added to the University Board of Trustees' consent agenda and approved on February 10.

And in calendar year 2021, the medical center had performed a record number of transplant procedures , with the organization now ranking No. 7 out of 250 transplant programs nationwide. Finally, the medical center also launched the Ohio State Health & Discovery website (health.osu.edu), which serves as the primary source for external consumers of health, wellness, innovation, research and science news from the experts at Ohio State. Mr. Larmore then thanked everyone at the medical center who was involved in quickly responding to a ransomware attack against workforce management company Ultimate Kronos Group. The attack on Kronos, which is a major timekeeping organization for health systems across the country, forced the medical center to develop a new, manual timekeeping process for 24,000 employees to ensure they were paid for the resulting two-week period. Mr. Larmore also acknowledged the third anniversary of the medical center's Healthy State Alliance with Bon Secours Mercy Health, and he commented on the great progress being made in developing new facilities on campus and across Ohio, even amidst the significant economic challenges posed by the pandemic. 3. James Cancer Hospital Report : William F arrar, CEO of the James Cancer Hospital, shared a variety of updates, including the recognition of Ohio State's Dr. Electra Paskett, the Marion N. Rowley Professor of Cancer Research, who was named a Top 50 Change Maker by the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Prevention for her work to address health disparities in cancer prevention, early detection and symptom science. He also highlighted a new collaboration with the Dayton Physicians Network as part of the James Cancer Network. Dramatic pr ogress has been made in treating cancer over the past three decades, predominantly coming from scientific research. The OSUCCC-James has 325 cancer researchers and more than 600 open clinical trials at any given time, with some of the world's latest discoveries available to clinical trial patients. The medical center's Outpatient Care West Campus facility, which is slated to open in 2023, will play a vital role in enhancing access to these cutting edge cancer services, such as the new proton therapy unit and the FLASH Mobetron device. Halfway through FY22, the OSUCC-James has achieved a 7 percent increase in total surgeries, a 14 percent increase in new patient clinic visits, and a 10 percent increase in overall clinic visits. It has also enrolled 961 patients in its more than 600 clinical trials, and researchers have received $76 million in total funding from the National Cancer Institute, representing some incredible accomplishments despite a very challenging year. (See Attachment X for background information, page XX) 4. Wexner Medical Center Financial Report : Mr . Larmore shared the medical center's financial results for the first half of the fiscal year through December 31, 2021. The health system - which includes the seven hospitals - saw an excess of revenue over expenses of $134 million, which was approximately $2 7 million more than anticipated. This was a 2.8% improvement over the same time last year, and he commented that it was impressive to still see growth even during the pandemic surge. The combined Wexner Medical Center results, consisting of the health system, College of Medicine and OSU Physicians, showed $165 million excess of revenue over expenses, which was approximately $48 million more than anticipated, and a 12.5% improvement y ear-over -year. Additionally, the university executed a bond off ering that generated $715 million in proceeds, increasing long-term debt. Cash from that offering went into assets limited as to use.

Mental Health and Addiction: 22% of Franklin County residents have been diagnosed with depression. Mental health needs account for a significant number of emergency department admissions. Deaths from drug overdoses, especially from opiates, are increasing at alarming rates. In 2017, there were 520 overdose deaths in Franklin County, a 47% increase from the previous year. Key Indicators Mental health Hire additional providers Improve access to care Addiction Narcan administrations Efforts by the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center to address these indicators include: Partnering with the other health systems, public health, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and community organizations to address addiction through the work of the Columbus and Franklin County Addiction Plan. Use of a standardized, evidence-based tool for depression screening for adults with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, referral if clinically necessary, effective treatment and appropriate follow-up. Providing Ohio State STAR (Stress, Trauma And Resilience) services for first responders through its collaboration with ADAMH (Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health Board of Franklin County) to provide peer support group sessions and create an app for first responders that will assess mental health and provide tools.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I Health Needs Assessment 2022 21 Increased naloxone education and distribution by integrating naloxone distribution models further within emergency departments and hospitals, addiction services and other treatment settings.

There were no comments on the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center's 2019 CHNA.About Franklin County HealthMap2022 1 The Franklin County Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee is pleased to provide residents of central Ohio with a comprehensive overview of our community's health status and needs via Franklin County HealthMap20 22. Franklin County HealthMap20 22 is the result of a broad collaborative effort coordinated by the Central Ohio Hospital Council (COHC), Columbus Public Health (CPH), and Franklin County Public Health (FCPH). The intent of this effort is to help health departments, hospitals , social service agencies, other organizations , and community stakeholders better understand the health needs and priorities of Franklin County residents. As part of its mission, COHC serves as the forum for community hospitals to collaborate with each other and with other community stakeholders to improve the quality, value, and accessibility of health care in the central Ohio region. Although COHC's member hospitals have service areas that extend across central Ohio, for the purposes of this report, the local geographic focus area is Franklin County. CPH serves the residents of the City of Columbus and the City of Worthington, and FCPH serves the residents of all other cities, towns, and villages in Franklin County. Characterizing and u nderstanding the prevalence of acute and chronic health conditions, access to care barriers, and other health issues can help direct community resources to where they will have the biggest impact. To that end, central Ohio's hospitals and health departments will begin using the data reported in Franklin County HealthMap20 22, in collaboration with other organizations, to inform the develop ment and implement ation of strategic plans to meet the community 's health needs. Consistent with federal requirements, Franklin County HealthMap20 22 will be updated in three years . The Fra nklin County Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee hope s Franklin County HealthMap20 22 serves as a guide to target and prioritize limited resources, a vehicle for strengthening community relationships, and a source of information that contri butes to keeping people healthy. Franklin County HealthMap20 22's Process The process for Franklin County HealthMap2022 reflected an adapted version of Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's County Health Rankings and Roadmaps: Assess Needs and Resources process.1 This process is designed to help stakeholders \"understand current community strengths, resources, needs, and gaps,\" so they can better focus their efforts and collaboration. 1 See https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/take -action -to-improve -health/action -center/assess -needs -resources About Franklin County HealthMap2022, continued 2 The primary phases of the Assess Needs and Resources process, as adapted for use in Franklin County HealthMap2022 , included the following steps. (1) Prepare to Assess. Members of the c ommunity were closely involved throughout with the design and implementation of Franklin County HealthMap2022 . On October 29, 2020 , members of the Franklin County HealthMap2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee1 gathered via Zoom to learn about the upcoming community health needs assessment process and how their experience and involvement would be critical for the s uccess of the effort. On November 20, 2020, the Steering Committee members received an email inviting them to participate in a brief community visioning survey. The purpose of this survey was to gather input on what a healthier Franklin County looks like as well as to help identify potential health indicators for inclusion in Franklin County HealthMap2022 . The 26 Steering Committee members who responded to the survey provided their feedback regarding : What would a healthy Franklin County look like to you? Given your vision for a healthy Franklin County, what do you think are the biggest barriers or issues that are keeping the County from getting there? Overall, what are the five most important issues or topics that should be considered in our upcoming community health assessment work? On January 25, 2021, the Steering Committee gathered again via Zoom to discuss their perspectives on emerging health issues in Franklin County, to participate in conversation with one another about the current state of health in the county and the results of the community visioning survey , and to identify potential health indicators for inclusion in Franklin County HealthMap2022 . Both small group discussions and large group \"report -outs\" occurred during this session. The Franklin County HealthMap2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Executive Committee then used the information from these preceding working meetings and community visioning survey to identify which indicators could be assessed via secondary sources and wh ich indicators could be gathered via primary data collection efforts. (2) Collect and Analyze Secondary Data. Quantitative secondary data for health indicators came from national sources (e.g., U.S. Census, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System), state sources (e.g., Ohio Department of Health's Data Warehouse, Ohio Hospital Association, Ohio Medicaid Assessment Surv ey), and local sources (e.g., Central Ohio Trauma System). Rates and/or percentages were calculated when necessary. In some instances, comparable state and/or national data were unavailable at the 1 These individuals are listed on page 6 of this report. About Franklin County HealthMap2022, continued 3 time of report preparation and, accordingly, are not includ ed in this report. All data sources are identified in a reference list following each section of the report. In some cases, new secondary data indicators were identified that were not included in the previous report ( HealthMap2019 ). For example, new indic ators include days of pollution or excessive heat, Opportunity Index scores, and the ratio of residents to psychiatrists. I n these instances, the most recent secondary data available are listed under the HealthMap2022 heading, and previous data are listed under the HealthMap2019 heading, even though these new data will not be found in the HealthMap2019 report . This was done for ease of reading. Indicators identified by the Steering Committee for inclusion in the Franklin County HealthMap2022 were then collected and entered into a database for review and analysis. To ensure community stakeholders can use this report to make well -informed decisio ns, only the most recent data available at the time of report preparation are presented. To be considered for inclusion in Franklin County HealthMap2022 , quantitative secondary data must have been collected or published in 2016 or later. (3) Collect and Analyze Primary Data. Qualitative primary data for health indicators were obtained from a series of nine 90-minute focus groups held from July 28, 202 1 through August 19, 2021 . These discussion sessions were held in convenient, trusted locations in the community (e.g., Columbus Metropolitan Library branches; township buildings; Columbus Public Health's administrative headquarters) and were facilitated by professional researcher s. A combination of grassroots/volunteer and professional/paid recruiting efforts were used to identify a diverse mix of Franklin County residents to participate in these sessions. Focus group participants received a financial incentive to attend these sessio ns and to share their opinions and experiences with the research team. Overall, 76 Franklin County adults who reside within the primary jurisdictions of the COHC - member hospitals (as defined for this process) , CPH, and FCPH participated in these focus groups, sharing their thoughts and observations about a wide range of health topics. These discussions included a focus on underlying factors that contribute to health issues, such as poverty and racism. Transcripts from these discussions can be found in the appendix. (4) Identify Priorit y Heath Needs. On October 13, 2021 , the Steering Committee received a draft copy of Franklin County HealthMap20 22, along with a request to suggest comment s on and edits to the report. On October 20 , 2021, the Steering Committee met via Zoom to review Franklin County HealthMap2022 and to identify potential priority health issues . The meeting participants were divided into small groups, with each group asked to review a specific section of Franklin About Franklin County HealthMap2022, continued 4 County HealthMap2022 and, within that section, to identify potential priority health issues for consideration by the larger group. In addition to sharing their personal experience and history during these small -group conversations , meeting participants were asked to consider the following criteria when prioritizing these health issues : Equity: Degree to which specific groups are disproportionally affected b y an issue. Size: Number of persons affected, taking into account variance from benchmark data and targets. Seriousness: Degree to which the health issue leads to death, disability, and impairs one's quality of life. Feasibility: Ability of organization or individuals to reasonably combat the health issue given available resources. Related to the amount of control and knowledge (influence) organization(s) have on the issue. Severity of the Consequences of Inaction: Risks associate d with exacerbation of the health issue if not addressed at the earliest opportunity. Trends: Whether or not the health issue is getting better or worse in the community over time. Intervention: Any existing multi -level public health strategies proven to b e effective in addressing the health issue. Value: The importance of the health issue to the community. Social Determinant / Root Cause: Whether or not the health issue is a root cause or social determinant of health that impacts one or more health issues. The meeting on October 20, 2021 led to the identification of 28 potential priority health issues that affect Franklin County residents. On November 8, 2021, the Steering Committee members received an invitation to participate in an online survey that would lead to the identification of the final set of priority health needs for the community. This prioritization survey was structured as follows. First, it provided an orientation to the purpose and in tent of the effort. It presented an array of criteria that respondents should use when identifying priority health needs (e.g., the list of nine factors presented above ). Each participant in this prioritization process was asked to consider the role played by social determinants of health and health inequities. The survey questionnaire then instructed respondents to review the list of 28 potential priority health issues and select a maximum of five (5) most important health issues affecting Franklin Count y residents. Overall, 29 Steering Committee members completed this survey. After tabulating the responses, there was clear consensus about the community's priority health needs : these are displayed on page 19 . From these exercises, the Steering Committee was able to complete its charge to identify the prioritized health needs of Franklin County. About Franklin County HealthMap2022, continued 5 (5) Identify Community Assets and Resources. In December 2021, the Executive Committee identif ied community assets and resources that could potentially address the prioritized health needs , including existing healthcare facilities, community organizations , and programs or other resources. Inclusion of these potential partners and resources in the Franklin County Health Map2022 is consistent with hospital requirements for conducting a needs assessment. (6) Share Results with the Community . In December 20 21, COHC conducted a review of Franklin County HealthMap 2022 to ensure that it was compliant with Internal Revenue Service regulations for conducting community health needs assessments. CPH and FCPH also conducted internal reviews to ensure the report satisfied the requirements set forth by the Public Health Accred itation Board (PHAB). No information gaps that may impact the ability to assess the health needs of the community were identified while conducting the 2022 health needs assessment for Franklin County. This report will be posted on COHC's, CPH's, and FCPH's websites , will be used in subsequent c ommunity prioritization and planning efforts, and will be widely distributed to organizations that serve and represent residents in the county. How To Read This Report Franklin County HealthMap 2022 is organized into multiple, distinct sections. Each section begins with a sentence that briefly describes the section and is then followed by \"call -out boxes\" that highlight and summarize the key findings of the data compilation and analysis, from the researchers' perspective s. For some indicators, the re lated U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 20 30 goals are included with Franklin County's status indicated by a icon if the goal is met and an icon if the goal hasn't been met. Each section includes several tables, designed to allow the reader to easily compare the most recent Franklin County data to historical Franklin County data, as well as state and national data. Most tables include the column headers Franklin County, Ohio, and the United States. Within the Franklin County header , there are three columns, labeled HM201 6, HM201 9, and HM2022 . HM 2022 references most recent data presented in HealthMap 2022 . HM201 9 references HealthMap201 9 or relevant historical data, and HM201 6 references HealthMap201 6 or relevant historical data . Throughout this report, a hyphen ( - ) is used within tables when data were not presented previously or are not accessible . As noted above, the re is a three -year interval between each version of Franklin County HealthMap . Whenever possible, 1 -year or 3 -year data estimates are reported in this About Franklin County HealthMap2022, continued 6 document; however, sometimes only 5-year data estimates were available. Comparisons of 5 - year data estimates among different HealthMap versions should be done with caution. In each table, the HM 2022 column also includes an upward -facing triangle () if the HM2022 statistic is greater than the one reported in HM201 9 by 10% or more . A downward -facing triangle () indicates the HM2022 statistic is less than the one reported in HM2019 by 10% or more . Use caution when interpreting indicators with small values , which only need relatively small changes to produce a 10% difference.

Community Voices on M aking a Healthy Community Communication and social connection between residents were widely recognized across community discussions as a feature of a healthy community . Additionally, c ommunity members mentioned safety in various dimensions. Access to healthcare services, as well as access to healthy foods and recreat ion were mentioned in multiple community discussions about what makes a community healthy. Less frequently mentioned features of a healthy community appear in bullet points at the end of this section. Communication and relationship building between members of the community support good mental health and feelings of safety . In discussions around relationship building and communication, community members mentioned the value of community activities to help people get to know one another, as well as the importance of communication specifically around local governance issues, not only between resident s in local community meetings , but between residents and their local government officials. \"Communication, like when you talk to people around you, you get a feeling for people and what they might need and what they're go ing through. You can share your experiences, I just think it's healthier when you talk to people around you, getting to know them better. \" \"I think the relationships - Kind of tying into what you were saying is building relationships in the community, too .\" \"I think a community that looks after each other, has good relations, is caring...And realizing that different is not bad, because we are all different, but we are all human. So the most important thing is to be caring. \" \"A friendly community, friendl y people will not develop anxiety, they will not develop depression, because of issues in the society. As long as we help each other care for each other. This will be a healthy society. \" \"Being able to talk to your neighbor, knowing that he's going to be out there checking out for your children if something happens, and just watching the neighborhood and making sure everyone is safe.\" \"If I see somebody at someone's door, I could say I can keep an eye out for him or something's happening. I can support t hem more and then they know what [I have to offer] and I know what [they have to offer].\" \"What she said about the old school feel, you know, knowing that you can trust the folks in your neighborhood to support or look out for each other.\" Vision of a Health y Franklin County , continued 12 Feeling s afe from crime is a feature of and a prerequisite to a healthy community , in how it benefits mental health and supports physically active lifestyles. Environmental safety , like the mitigation of air and water pollutant s, pests, and uncollected trash are another important aspect of safety . \"It would also include traffic and mitigation of traffic, a lot of cars and fumes and exhaust. That's something t hat doesn't necessarily lend itself to a healthy environment if there is a lot of traffic near the places where you live or congregate.\" \"[Not] having industrial parks close by or train stations and things of that nature that pass off a lot of fumes that could impact kids, or powerline grids that might have other kinds of things like radiation that might have a history of causing things tha t are cancerous. The presence of those things do es impact the health of the community.\" \"The City of Columbus is doing all these initiatives to try to reduce emissions, and they didn't meet their 2020 deadline, but they have a new one for 2050. And they'r e introducing things like thirsty gardens to help with rainwater that pools in places that's unhealthy for children because it gets into our waterways, [more of] those types of types of incentives and things that are going on.\" \"Your shelter has to be such that it's healthy, mitigation of lead paint, safe drinking water. So no lead in your water or no other contaminants or whatever. \" \"Just feeling safe, knowing that it's safe, feeling secure in your environment. Safety is primarily it. I mean, if you feel safe, then you feel free. You can pretty much go after your dreams .\" \"You are not all stressed and there is a lot of safe places. A lot of stress creeps up a lot of anxieties and makes you worry about certain things which you have to keep outside, and you don't have to bring them in and you worried about where they are going to be in the morning and stuff like that. Any noise at night you sort of worry somebody is breaking in and so on. \" \"Then stress levels as well. Like what's going on in the neighborhood, that kind of plays very big into the mental health aspect. Is it a loud area? Is there are a lot of a lot of stuff going on as far as trouble and whatever else, you know? Is it easy to sleep at night? \" \"I think a healthy community protects its children, whether that means making sure the schools are safe , or just the streets themselves , the neighborhood, the playgrounds are places where kids can play freely and feel safe. \" \"I would say safety, we feel safe enough to walk and be outside or safe enough to let our kids be outside ...\" Vision of a Health y Franklin County , continued 13 \"Landlords that are responsible when it comes to pest control, bed bugs. I don't have the money to do it myself, and we don't have a landlord who helps take care of it in that way. It ruins people's lives.\" \"So cleanliness, not just for myself, but for the neighbors in the way that it's managed by the city and trash pickup and all that stuff...Is it a physically clean neig hborhood?\" Other factors of environmental safety mentioned by residents included infrastructure like sidewalks and streetlights to ensure people feel safe to walk around their community without danger from cars and traffic. Additionally, healthy communities overcome barriers to general and behavioral health care access , like lack of transportation, financial, or language supports . \"It has access to healthcare when necessary that's not too challenging to reach and get to .\" \"When I think of health, I think of hospitals, like a nearby hospital. \" \"Supportive services. Just a general healthcare center. \" \"Access to healthcare, close facilities. \" \"Accessible health care costs. \" \"Not being afraid to go to the hospital just because you know that you're not going to be able to pay the bill. \" \"Free clinics. \" \"Mental health coverage is important. \" \"Drug counseling. \" \"Well, mental health is a part of being healthy too, so having those types of resources in the communities is also important, especially in our schools, where kids are dealing with a lot of things that they might not feel comfortable talking about at home. \" \"I also think language and culture are a big disadvantage, because a lot of people don't speak the same language . There's a barrier there, communicating and like articulating all the information that we're trying to give to patients. I think that's where things fall apart, where there's not communication between the patient and the provider, there's always communica tion but with a translator, it doesn't always translate back to [being understood]. \" Vision of a Health y Franklin County , continued 14 Access to other community resources supporting health, like nutritious foods and recreation spaces are also present in residents' visions of a healthy community. In one community discussion, community members brought up the concept of co-located grocery stores and medical services, specifically a pay -what -you-can-afford concept in a Columbus neighborhood. To some who lived in the area this resource was unfamiliar, sparking discussion on how information about resources is shared within the communi ty and the benefit of having more centralized and affordable resources in Franklin County. Other features of healthy communities brought up by community members included: Funding infrastructure improvements in roads and schools Strong educational and job opportunities Diversity \"Good \" public transportation \"A healthy community, to me, has access to things like fresh foods and produce and groceries .\" \"When I think healthy, I'm thinking things like fresh water, fresh food, or good food to eat. I think nutrition. \" \"Healthy food opti ons that are affordable .\" \"Grocery stores, being in a place where there's not an accessible grocery store. Not a family dollar, like fresh produc e.\" \"It also has the presence of those other kind of social activities that promote health, like walking trails and bike paths, things like that. \" \"I think physical activity .\" \"I would say local rec centers or the availability to your neighborhood or community to utilize them. \" \"And a healthy community should have plenty of green spaces for children to play, parks that are kept up for exercise .\" Important Health Issues 15 This section details what Franklin County residents perceive to be the most important health issues in their communitie s. Community Voices on Important Health Issues Difficulty accessing health care services, poor mental health, and barriers to healthy eating habits were often mentioned in community discussions about the most important health issues facing community members . One of the most frequently mentioned health issues was the prohibitive cost of health care and prescriptions . Community members specified this was a problem even for people who had health insurance. Mistrust in the health care system is another issue preventing optimal community health . Community members spoke to the difficulty of feeling confident that health care services are in their best interest when the costs of this feel exploitative . People of color have additional difficulty trusting the health care system due to fear of receiving less quality care , along with fear of being stereotype d or exposed to racist behavior from health care professionals. \"Cost of healthcare in general. It's not only people sometimes don't have the right coverages, but out of pocket, it's just tremendously expensive. \" \"I spent a two-year span of time where my choice was either to pay for my insurance and not be able to afford the medical care or not be insured and be able to pay for medical care kind of out of pocket, which seems crazy, but the reality was, you know, sometimes you get in a situation where even though the copay makes it easier. You can't afford both at the same time. \" \"I am insured, but the deductible is so high, I can't afford to use it. I've needed scans for two years, but I'm still paying for the one that I had two years ago. So do I want to go have another one? \" \"I think another problem is people can't afford their medications, you get it and it jumps, astronomical prices. I don't know. I think some people go without it because they can't afford it or they have to make a really tough decision about what can they pay. \" \"And personally, I've had to make the decision between do I want to go talk to the doctor or get some sort of checkup for myself to try and address what I feel like I'm dealing with? Or do I want to be able to pay for the prescriptions that I have coming up in the month? \" \"Can't afford their prescriptions .\" Important Health Issues , continued 16 Other issues related to health care access mentioned by community members included : Difficulty scheduling appointments due to lack of available providers, leading to overuse of emergency services Difficulty keeping the same provider long -term, due to provide rs changing practices Lack of medical facilities Lack of community outreach on importance of breastfeedi ng Children lacking early intervention for developmental issues Lack of affordable in -home providers for elderly care Lack of affordable elder care facilities COVID -19 vaccine misinformation Scarce mental health resources / insurance coverage Health insurance access for the homeless population Poor m ental health was another common response across community discussions about the most important health issues . Specifically, many community members brought up depression, anxiety, and stress , and how they are caused or influenced by a variety of societal issues (including COVID -19). As one community member emphasized, mental health is important for how it affects o verall health and quality of life. \"Lack of trust in the healthcare system.\" \"Lack of trust in the healthcare professionals because a lot of people perceive healthcare industry as a business which is there just to make money off of them, so that lack o f trust is a big issue.\" \"There's a big lack of trust with doctors for me in my community. It's like we don't want to go there. Soon as we get to the hospital, somebody is diagnosed with something and then a month or two later, they're dead. We kind of ei ther don't want to know or when we get to the hospital we're basically on our death bed. So there's a lot of lack of trust, and I think that that probably has to do with the information that we're fed. We don't know that we're poisoning ourselves or not ex ercising or whatever it is that our personal body needs. We don't get to help it.\" \"The reluctance of pain doctors to provide patients medication to alleviate their pain. There was a Western Virginia University study by Caucasian interns, and the question was posed, 'Do you believe African -Americans have a higher pain threshold than anybody else around? ' And they truly still believe that. That's so prevalent in our society that these stigmas are attached to individuals that look like me. And that's going to have to be something that's going to have to be changed because that statement is not getting patie nts adequate medication to alleviate their pain. We're not lying when we say we're in pain. We're human.\" Important Health Issues , continued 17 \"I think right now, it's like loneliness, feeling lonely. I know kids have to spend almost all day long alone because parents are working, and now even parents have been lonely because they don't have work.\" \"Some people may not necessarily be in the right mind space to have to go into work, especially people with some sort of disability where working from home might have been easier, and then transitioning back into the office may not be so easy for them. Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of kind of like social anxiety that comes with that, going back toward everything kind of being back to normal .\" \"I think that COVID has caused a lot of anxiety. \" \"People take [political issues] so seriously as to divide communities. It enables them to be divided because we believe different ideologies and stuff, all these go to put stress on the general community. \" \"And when you have, you know, you have a lot of stress and strife, then that isn't good for your health. Because of concerns about crime, and, you know, there is just so much violence. This day that hits it's fearful for older people, especial ly to worry about getting out into the environment, then you don't know what's going to happen to you. So it's a very frightening time. \" \"Depression and anxiety. So many people are suffering from depression and anxiety...because what is going on in socie ty and that is affecting them mentally. They're talking about this lack of togetherness...race...increase in hate. \" \"So I would say that mental health is probably the number one issue, mainly because, if you don't have good mental health, you're not going to have good physical health because you're not going to want to get up and go do anything. \" Lack of affordable places to find fresh, good quality foods was also deemed an important health issue. \"Lack of healthy food, like restaurants, but particularly grocery stores. I feel like they're hidden, and then they're small, and then they're not always the freshest. And if they are, they're very expensive.\" \"Maybe even affordable, healthy restaurants. Most of your local restaurants are pretty exp ensive. I know they're above [my budget]. And I mean, I make pretty good money, but if I'm going there it's usually something special.\" \"My grocery store immediately in my area is not good. I usually come down here and shop at Grove port. I actually, hones tly, I will go into old Grove port because the Kroger in my area, the quality of food and the prices are not quality food and does not match the price.\" Important Health Issues , continued 18 Community members also spoke to a lack of knowledge on how to practice healthy eating behaviors , as well as the underestimation of nutrition's importance for overall health outcomes. Additional health issues mentioned by community members include: Ease of accessing alcohol and other addictive / unhealthy substances Drug addiction Cancer Diseases transmitted sexually or via needles Gun violence Lack of knowledge of community resources Proactive attitudes to change health behaviors Youth education outcomes suffering during COVID -19 Lack of parenting knowledge Poor dental health and access to dental care Lack of resources supporting hygiene for homeless individuals Unemploymen t Poor water quality Lack of transportation and accessible transportation for seniors Lack of resources for infants' basic needs (clean diapers, formula) \"I think also it's a matter of being educated about getting healthy habits from being a young child, exercisin g, eating fruits and vegetables. And a lot of our people are not willing to do that. You see children going to school with chips and candy. You see teachers in school giving out candy to as an incentive. I'm from Canada, so we never do that.\" \"We get acce ss to these really great vegetables from these farmers markets and from these pop -ups and these food banks and whatever, but people don't know how to cook them. So it's like, 'Great. Now what? ' So I feel like there's steps that are missing, in the in betwe en and on the end.\" \"The idea of, okay, what you put into your body on a regular basis directly correlates to, you know, how you feel, and your overall health and stuff like that. Because I think there's a lack of knowledge sometimes regarding that.\" \"Access to healthy foods leading to food -based or consumption -based diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain forms of cancer like colon cancer.\" Priorit y Health Needs 19 This section lists the prioritized health needs of Franklin County. The prioritized health needs affecting Franklin County residents, as identified by the Franklin County HealthMap2022 Steering Committee , include: basic needs; racial equity ; behavioral health; and maternal -infant health. These health issues are interrelated, and in many cases are likely co -occurring. For example, the effects of redlining still impact basic needs and health care access for disadvantaged racial and ethnic groups, and t hose experiencing homelessness and hous ing insecurity may face compromised mental health as a result. Basic needs are the first highest prior ity. This is comprised of the following specific and interrelated indicators : housing security ; financial stability ; neighborhood safety ; food security ; and a need for increased access to nutritious foods . Priority # 1: Basic Needs Specific indicators See pages Housing security (decreased homelessness, increased affordability) 33-35 Financial stability 32-33 Neighborhood safety (reduced crime) 49-50 Food security 35-36 Increased access to nutritious foods 76-79 Racial equity is tied with behavioral health as the second highest priority. Practices of r acial and ethnic discrimination , including redlining, preclude residents ' access to economic stability, quality health care services, and optimal maternal and infant health outcomes , among other health needs. Priority # 2a: Racial Equity Specific indicators See pages (Effects on) Economic and housing stability 32-34 (Effects on) Quality healthcare, mental health, and feelings of safety 51-53 (Effects on) Maternal and infant health outcomes 85-91 Behavioral health is tied with r acial equity as the second highest priority. Poor mental health outcomes persist for many in Franklin County, and residents may have difficulty finding a mental health professional they trust to help them. Existing mental health care services may be underutilized due to the stigma associated with seeking mental health support. Priori ty Health Needs , continued 20 Priority # 2b: Behavioral Health Specific indicator s See pages Access to mental health care resources 31, 61-62 Screening for mental health issues 95-99 Decreased unintentional drug and alcohol deaths 74 Youth mental health supports (clinical, social) 99-101 The third highest priority for Franklin County is maternal and infant health, which is comprised of the need to reduce the rate of infant mortality and the need to improve maternal pre -pregnancy health. Priority # 3: Maternal -Infant Health Specific indicators See pages Infant mortality 85-87 Maternal pre -pregnancy health 89-92 Page 129 of this report presents a list of potential partners , resources , and community assets that could potentially help to address these prioriti zed health needs. For context, Ohio's 20 20-2022 State Health I mprovement Plan (SHIP) identified three priority health topics (or, general areas of focus) that communities should consider when planning to improve the population's health. These three priority health topics include mental health and addiction, chronic disease, and mate rnal and infant health , as shown below . For each of these priority health topics, Ohio 's 2020-2022 SHIP also identified specific p riority health outcomes , which are listed in the table below . Overall, there is a good alignment between the prioritized health needs identified by HealthMap20 22 and Ohio's 20 20-2022 SHIP. Health Priority Topics And Outcomes Identified By Ohio's 20 20-2022 SHIP Mental Health and Addiction Chronic Disease Maternal and Infant Health Depression Suicide Youth drug use Drug overdose deaths Heart disease Diabetes Childhood conditions (asthma, lead) Preterm births Infant mortality Maternal morbidity Priori ty Health Needs , continued 21 Lastly, it should be noted that several other health issues were also considered by the Steering Committee as part of this prioritization process . Although these other issues play an important role in affecting the health of Franklin County residents, they did not receive the same level of endorsement as compared to the priority health needs reviewed previously . The other health issues considered by the Steering Committee are listed below. Cancer screening Decreased alcohol use (especially among youth) Decreased firearm injuries Decreased sedentary lifestyle behaviors Decreased tobacco use (especially among youth) Healthy blood pressure Improved high school graduation rates Improved pandemic readiness Increased access to health care Increased health literacy Increased physical activity resources Increased safe mobility for elderly Lower rates of STIs/HIV Reduced geographic disparities in health outcomes Community Profile 22 This section provides demographic information about Franklin County 's residents and households.

Key Findings Health Care Access Though most residents have health insurance, Franklin County still does not meet the national goal for residents under 65 with health insurance. Community members say health insurance is not enough to make costs of health care accessible to everyone. Income & Poverty While various measures show increasing household incomes and decreasing rates of food insecurity since the previous HealthMap , these data do not yet reflect the effects of COVID -19 on these factors . More current data may present a less positive change in these indicators. Education The overall graduation rate of high school students in Franklin County exceed s the national goal . However, rates of graduation for Black and African American a s well as Hispanic students are still lower than overall rates and rates for other groups. Social & Community Context Franklin County residents are affected by rates of v iolent and property crime similar to the previous HealthMap . Other social factors impeding optimal health outcomes include racism , which results in disparities in health care quality and utility, as well as mental health outcomes and access to resources. Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 25 Health Care Access Indicator s This section describes indicators of a population's access to health care : health insurance status, as well as accounts of other fac tors impeding access according to community members. The percentage of Franklin County residents that have health insurance coverage has remained similar to the previous HealthMap . Individuals With Health Insurance Franklin County Ohio Franklin County residents have private health insurance (69.3%) than public health coverage . Public health insurance rates in Franklin County have remained similar to the previous HealthMap . Medicaid coverage has increased since the previous HealthMap, and the percentage of residents with this coverage in Franklin County is higher than the national average. The total persons under 65 with health insurance in Franklin County is 91.1%, lower than the state but higher than the national average (89.2%). The state of Ohio meets the national goal at 92.2%, while Franklin County does not. Franklin County: 91.1%1 Target: 92.1%4 Percent of residents under age 65 with health insurance Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 26 Community Voices on Health Care Costs On the topic of health care access, community members frequently mentioned how the expenses associated with medical care can influence whether people get the care they need. As community members see it, having insurance is only part of health care access , as utilizing health care also depends on understanding their insurance , being able to find a medical provider who takes it, and being able to pay any costs left over. Those who lack insurance for various reasons may not know how to get coverage , or how to get care if they are uninsured. Those who have insurance may still struggle with knowing where they can go that takes their insurance, and otherwise understanding how their insurance works. \"I know some people don't have Medicaid or Medicare. And you don't have private insurance. You don't have any insurance. They cannot afford to pay for health insurance ...\" \"Having health insurance and the type of job that offers you benefits that will get you those type of things is anot her barrier to access .\" \"And so, a lot of people can't afford that ...dental and vision is very important to the elderly. But this has got to come out of your pocket. \" \"Having the proper information about where to go to find out what insurance what you can obtain, that's also an issue. Not having the proper information and knowing exactly where to go to get that information to obtain the insurance that you may need. \" \"Then misinformation. Like anything that you have to meet a certain criterion to have cover age, or, again, that could be coming from loved ones that don't know any better. They just kind of perpetuate that lie. \" \"Yeah, so it's like something you have to deal with, but it's not so easy. Like, you have some doctors that say one thing you know. Just a lot of like, not enough specialists for her, you know, her fingers turn blue, so you get a whole breaks out in hives. So it's just like, there's not a lot of doctors that would take her insurance so it's hard to find somebody that specialize s in something that she needs or medici ne or anything so it's really hard like that. \" \"There's the struggling to understand your co -pays, where you're supposed to go for your insurance, and all that jazz .\" \"I don't know if anybody's ever actually tried to read all your insurance documents, bu t it's written at the senior college level, and it's like reading a court document. It's so much, mine's so thick. I can't even start to fathom to memorize all this and even know what half of it means ...\" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 27 Individuals may not be able to afford the cost after insurance. Their copay or deductible can be too high, and they can have additional anxiety about what other costs they may be burdened with after a medical visit. For those who have insurance, it may not cover everything they need . Especially dental care, vision care, or prescriptions . Community members expressed concern that people may put off th ose types of care for this reason , or ration medication due to financial concerns . Cost concerns can also prohibit individuals from accessing needed mental health care . \"And beyond even the copay, even if you can afford the copay, there's always the anxiety once you go in what mystery bill you'll either come out with or, how much is this test you obviously didn't know about, or this medication that they prescribed. Or your deductible. Maybe you got a $2000 deductible on your medical, and that's $2000 you're going to owe anyway whether you have insurance or not. \" \"But then on the other sid e is that, once you've seen the doctor, the doctor asks you to do something, the prior authorizations for medicine, the fighting back and forth to get labs or things done and covered. The fact that your doctor can say, 'This is what I want for you ,' and your insurance can still say , 'Absolutely not.' \" \"For me personally, I won't go to a doctor's visit if I have to pay a certain amount for a copay. \" \"Or even if you have insurance, you may be laid off and your savings account got drained because you weren't making as much. So now you can't afford the copay, and you normally would be able to. So you're wondering how to deal with that. \" \"The cost of copays depends on your insurer. Like she was saying, you don't get the same doctor you had before t he pandemic, so everything switched up. And then they find a reason to charge you more for it. \" \"I was only able to go to a certain number of counseling sessions that my job had paid for. So I mean, insurance only covers so much. \" \"A lot of times you can't go and see a counselor because of the expense. \" \"And a lot of self-diagnosis, especially going on Google and looking up your symptoms. That's the worst thing you can do. And then of course we're ruminating about the problem of the industry where costs is always going to be there for every decision. So of course you'r e going to go online first. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 28 OTHER SOCIAL DETERMINANTS IMPACTING HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION Cost is only one factor impacting individuals' access to health care. The availability of medical providers is another factor and is explored in detail in the following section (Health Resource Availability ). Other issues affecting residents ' decisions to delay or put off needed health car e are explained here. Community Voices on General Health Care Utilization Individual s' attitudes toward the health care system , specifically whether they have built a relationship of trust with the medical community, was regarded as a major factor impacting how individuals take advantage of health care resources . Perceiving health care as a low priorit y was also seen to impact this, along with various other factors (discussed below). Racial discrimination is one reason individuals may not trust medical providers . Black and African American community members in particular spoke about their community's experience s receiv ing inadequate health care . \"I think that has to do with discrimination somehow because it 's been said that when you go to the emergency as a Black female, there are few chances for them to believe that you are i n pain. A couple of years ago, I was dealing with a gallbladder issue. It was excruciating, and they let me sit there for hours to find out that I needed a surgery right away ...So as a Black woman, any way you go to get care, even if you 're about to deliver, they just don 't believe it when you say that you 're dying. \" \"I went hunched over in pain. They let me wait, wait, wait, wait, and it turns out a cyst had burst in my left ovary. I needed emergency surgery. But at this point, you guys have let me sit here. It 's like if I 'm not screaming, blood pouring out, if I'm able to handle myself a little bit, then [they think] I must not be in that much pain. How can you look at somebody and they have something going on, on the inside, and you tell them that they 're okay? So after that, I wouldn 't go to the hospital. I would just tough it out. And then, once I finally did get my insurance and went to the doctor, I had another growth. It could have been taken care of if I did have that kind of trust factor and wasn 't afraid that I 'm just going there getting another bill. Because at that point, that 's all it is, is I 'm paying to get no help. \" \"Everything 's overlooked a lot of times. Even if you go to the ER and you think you know what 's wrong with you, but they... You know what I mean? They could think you 're just faking it, or you just want [pain medication] . They overlook a lot of patients that end up going home and finding out that they had something seriously wrong with them. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 29 Individuals who have Medicaid or other public health insurance may have difficulty building relationships of trust with their medical providers . Community members perceived that affordable health care options for this population may be worse quality. In these conversations c ommunity members also spoke about issues receiving good quality medical care as influenced by the ability to see the same provider consistently . This was perceived to encourage quality care in terms of thorough knowledge of a patien t's medical history and pain threshold , which in turn supported strong relationships with providers and utilization of medical care. COVID -19 demonstrated how individuals may increasingly see k medical advice from sources other than medical professionals . This can increase confusion and negatively impact utilization of health care services that support optimal health. \"Using Facebook as your information outlets. There 's a lot of negative messages in Facebook that sometimes stops people from going and get the COVID vaccine. \" \"I think also a lack of trus t on a larger scale in the actual institutions that are handing down information like governmental organizations \u2014Department of Health, CDC. I feel like people in our communities, they 're getting all this information from the internet ...Or the things that the y're hearing on like TikTok and Instagram don 't align with the things that hear from the CDC. They are hearing these things from people in their communities that they trust. So when those things don 't align, they don 't know where to turn. \" \"I'd say a lot of it also had to do with information overload and kind of confused thing. ...You have like 20 different sources telling you different things. That kind of makes you freeze in your tracks and ultimately do nothing ...and making some problems worse. So I definitely think that too much information is a big problem for not getting treatment in a good amount of time. \" \"To go to a place that doesn't take your insurance, you got to pay out of pocket. That's too much, so you'll go to a place that will accept your insurance, but they kind of treat you like a number because that's how they get their funding pretty much is by how many people they see...The healthcare that you can go to for free is kind of not up to par, and that's from my personal experience over probably the last two, three years, honestly. So I think that is the biggest thing, just being treated like a number when you're going to the only place you can go to get your healthcare.\" \"There is sometimes with some providers, a stigma that comes with having health insurance through Medicaid, public benefit, need where your quality of care is reduced, as opposed to ha ving private insurance, where everyone is treated, you know, with equity.\" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 30 Aside from issues of trust, individuals may be too busy with other commitments, like work and caretaking, to feel like taking time for h ealth care . Additionally, they may fear finding out that they have a medical issue that will threaten their ability to work. Community members mentioned that fear of a diagnosis , as well as famil y or cultur al beliefs and behaviors surrounding medicine can impact whether people get health care when they need it . These responses are summarized below. Not want ing to deal with a diagnosis that require s ongoing care or monitoring Fear that they will be advised to change their lifestyle and what they consume Orientation of family members to going to the doctor, or not going Cultural beliefs that emphasize home remedies for an illness before seeking advice from a medical professional Previously this section discussed the broader, and potentially long -term effects of COVID -19 on people's attitudes toward medical care . Some short -term impacts of COVID -19 on health care utilization were brought up in community discussions and are summarized below . Individuals putting off routine medical visits out of fear of exposure to COVID -19 Individuals putting off health concerns or medical visits they deemed \"not major\" and choosing to wait until \"things opened up\" Individuals who formerly provided transportation assistance for the ir elderly family members to get to medical appointments not doing this due to fear of putting the elderly at risk \"Busy life, they just put it off until tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, until it 's an emergency. \" \"I think sometimes people who are caregivers will put themselves last. I think during COVID a lot of people put a lot of their own needs second, especially like moms, dads, people who are caring for their own family, extended families, their own aging parents. They are considering thei r children and their aging parents before they 're considering themselves. So they kind of get the people who need care who are the most able bodied, sometimes leave mental health and also maybe smaller medical issues to just linger. \" \"We don 't do enough o f the preventative care, I think, as a society, as a community. I think we only go to the doctor if something 's wrong. And I think it 's because of our negative experiences when there was something wrong. You don't want to hear it. I have a neighbor who is a contracted employee. If he doesn 't work, he doesn 't get pai d. If something is wrong with him, his family goes hungry because he 's the only breadwinner in the family. He doesn 't go to the doctor regularly. He doesn 't do what he needs to do ...the time associated with taking time off do those things. Those are barriers that we don 't have safeguards in place to ensure that everyone has the abilit y.\" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 31 Community Voices on Mental Health Care Utilization Access to mental health care is complicated by the stigma associated with mental illness. People who could benefit from mental health care may not recognize they need it or be willing to accept they have an issue . \"Sometimes you don't even know you need help. I think a lot of times, we may not even recognize when we need help.\" \"They think they could stop it on their own, and then that's not really how it works. The thing is people don't want to accept the fact that there's something wrong with them to get help. It hinders a lot of people .\" Being validated by others that it's appropriate to seek help is important . This is made more difficult due to socio -cultural beliefs that link mental illness to weakness. \"Proper emotional focus on actually taking that seriously. It used to be getting looks and misunderstood. The entire family would brush it off. \" \"If your family is not supportive, and those around you are not supportive, then it's hard to go. \" \"Black people, they don't need mental health, or...we've just been told you don't need that or that's for weak people or whatever... \" \"From my African background, where depression, things like that isn't really spoken of. Especially if you mentioned something like that, you know, they take a biblical approach. Or they'll give you old village examples. It's like none of those are appropriate. \" \"Coming from a man's perspective, masculinity is [important] when it comes to not seeking help because it shows a sign of weakness...they don't discuss it with their buddies ...we're supposed to be men. We believe it on the inside. \" People may fear being judged if they open up about needing help. \"You fear being judged if you do need to seek a therapist or counselor .\" \"People might be embarrassed or ashamed of certain situations, so they don't want to address it .\" \"Not exactly a popular thing to go and see a counselor or talk to somebody that you feel that way as well .\" Also mentioned was the general fear of trusting medical providers with information about their mental state , and fear that this information could potentially be used against them . Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 32 Income/ Poverty Indicators This section describes income and poverty indicators that affect health , including household income, rates of homelessness and other measures of housing insecurity, and food insecurity . In Franklin County, the me dian net household income is $ 64,713 , which is higher than the median in Ohio, but slightly lower than the national figure. There is a higher percentage of families living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) in Franklin County than in Ohio or the United States. However, t he percentages of families and children living 100% below FPL have decreased since the previous HealthMap (12.5% to 10.0 % for families and 2 4.5% to 18.4 % for children). A similar percentage of children enrolled in school in Franklin County are eligible for free or reduced lunch compared to the previous HealthMap .

Lowest Median Household Income in Franklin County7 HOUSING INSECURITY Housing insecurity is a term encompassing many different housing challenges, including affordability, quality, and safety. Homeless ness is the most severe form of housing insecurity , and is measured here using A \"Point in Time Count\" (PIT) estimate , a count of th e total number of people experiencing homelessness (sheltered and unsheltered) on a single night of the year. A count of individuals, as well as the percentage of homeless families (denoted by \"persons in families\") is shown on the next page . Homeless persons were considered part of a family if they were in a group consisting of at least one adult and at least one child under age 18 . Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 34 In Franklin County , the PIT estimate is higher than the previous HealthMap , and t he percentage of homeless using an emergency shelter who are part of a family has remained similar . About three -quarters of families using emergency shelters in Franklin County are African American (75%), well over the composition of African American families in shelters in emergency shelters in Ohio (53.1%) .

Households who spend over 30% of the total household income on housing related costs are at increased risk of housing insecurity. The percentage of Franklin County households who spent 30% or more of income on housing remains similar to the previous HealthMap at around 31%.

In 2016, the Eviction Lab at Princeton University found that Columbus ' eviction rate was 4.6 per 100 renter homes, which was similar to the eviction rates in Cleveland (4.6) and Cincinnati (4.7). In other Midwestern cities, the eviction rate varies from 1.1 in Chicago, to 5.2 in Detroit, Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 35 and 7.3 in Indianapolis . More recent ly (from July 18, 2021 - August 23, 2021), Eviction Lab data suggests that census tracts in eastern Fran klin County are associated with a large number of eviction filings .16 Census Tracts With Greatest Number of Eviction Filings16 FOOD INSECURITY Food insecurity is another indicator of poverty . The USDA describes food insecurity as the \"limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways .\"17 In Franklin County, 1 2.8% of residents are food insecure. With data re flecting 2019 rates , this percentage does not represent food insecurity experienced during the COVID -19 pandemic . More recent data may provide higher estimates of food insecurity .

Also mentioned was poverty's impact on mental health, nutrition, and housing outcomes. Community members discussed how poverty limits the places individuals can go for health care and impacts which staff members treat them. \"So a lot of places don't want to deal with people that have any kind of Medicaid unless it's straight up Medicaid because then they know they'll get paid. So I think a lot of people have that problem being treat ed badly because of that. \" \"And I've noticed that when you go to healthcare clinics or facilities of any sort, if you don't have decent type of coverage, they'll send their students, they being the doctors who are specialists of that area or just the inter nists. \" \"The quality of care you receive is based on your economic level. So that's very disheartening. So then you do get the kids who are right out of medical school. They're probably getting some incentive. They're only going to work in these clinics fo r a very short period of time, and then they're going to be gone. \" \"You are experimental. Whether it's dentistry, whether it's heart surgery, it does not matter. I've se en it. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 37 Poverty was linked with having less insurance coverage or unaffordable deductibles. \"Part of the reason you're in poverty, too , would be a low -paying job. And being that most of our healthcare is employer tied, some of those low -paying jobs might not have the same healthcare that someone making more money might inherently have, so they're already at a disadvantage. \" \"First of all, it causes so many health issues, because you can't afford the medication or the medical things that you need. \" \"I feel like preventative medicine being covered by insurance is almost laughable. Like, 'Oh we've got the annual things .' Then you're like, okay, well I have a tumor in my lungs like I did last year. And they were like, 'Oh, we can't pay it. Because we co uld not have foreseen that this was coming .' And like, it just was so crushing to me that when I saw the list of things that were covered, and then when I needed care for something in my lung, they were like, you have to meet your $5,000 deductible. \" People in poverty may have to put off health care or may practice more unhealthy behaviors in order to save money for basic needs that come first: child care , housing, and transportation . \"From a caretaker perspective, anytime, again, you're responsible for kids or loved one and whoever it may be, your needs/desires, whatever it is, end up coming last. So it's making sure that the $9 bottle of formula or the healthier lunch alternatives for my daughter are there. All of a sudden, I'm eating ra men noodles or I'm grabbing $5 pizza from Little Caesars because I can eat twice off that. But I also know that means that I'll have the good formula for my son to eat.\" \"The less money you have, the more financially driven your decision -making is. This country is so money driven that healthcare is going to come last when you have rent, and you have kids. Or if you work 60/80 hours a week just to take care of bills... Your first priority is always going to make sure you have a roof over your house . Like will I have a roof over my house ? Do I have food to eat? Can I physically survive? Like I'm not homeless. So that's like your main concern if you're in povert y. That's what you're worrying about. You're not worrying about what's this weird bump I h ave on my hand? Why am I feeling different? \" \"That rings so true for me and people in my life too. It's just like there's so many things I need to take care of and pay for: and loans and bills. Be able to have a car to drive to work and be able to go to w ork. I'm like there's just so many lists of things I have to do, care for, pay for. Like my health is the absolute bottom every time. Every time. \" \"There used to be when I was younger, you used to be able to sign off on a form for elementary school kids t o be like, oh, you can give them dental care, and then they'll take them to a teeth cleaning for free vaccines or whatever. And now at most schools that won't happen. It would have made it easier for parents with Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 38 taking off from work. Because the school ta kes care of it, you give consent, they're able to get it. So there's, that's often the people can't take off from work, and that's an issue with the income .\" Poverty has a negative impact on the mental health of adults and youth. \"Having a lack of resources, and the parent gets stressed out and that affects how they parent .\" \"I also think like if you can put a roof over your family's head and dinner on the table, th ose are two like very stabilizing things for our family. So, you've also reduced like mental health stress... \" \"I think it makes it makes [mental health] worse because I think if you're in poverty, you're usually depressed .\" \"They see these kids come with name brands, and these kids who can't afford name brands get teased, and that can cause depression. And when they go home, they're asking their parents. 'Oh, so -and-so has this. I want you to buy me this.' And the parents can't afford it. \" Poverty impacts the ability of people to get adequate, nutritious food. It also limits what people are able to eat if they don't have utilities or the resources to cook food. \"Some of the children in the poor area, they might go all day and not even have food. \" \"You have to talk about food and either for lack of time and energy from working, they don't have opportunities to prepare food at home. Sometimes it's cheaper to get something that's not as good quality. \" \"Healthy food is expensive. Cheap fo od is like fattening food. You're going to go for it if you're lacking the funds. Buy whatever's the cheapest. \" \"It affects all of them because you have different point of view depending on how much money you have. If you have somebody that makes 200 gran d and I make 50 grand, our perspective on everything's going to be different. That $20 lettuce wrap is going to be affordable. Or if you make 20 grand a year in your household, you can't even afford the cheeseburger at McDonald's. \" \"I mean, there's just m ore checks and balances that need to go in place to just give people a box of food or produce. I don't know what his situation is, but one of the panhandlers, someone gave him a whole box of produce. I'm thinking, 'Well, what is he going to do ?' He didn't look like he had the facilities to wash it [or cook it] .\" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 39 Those affected by poverty may have increased residential mobility due to rising housing costs in gentrified areas. The standard of housing they can afford may also compromise their health outcomes. \"Several people reported to me that they're being evicted from their apartment complex. They've stayed many years and paid their rent faithfully ...But their lease is not going to be renewed, and now they're scrabbling to find places ...The elderly that's in the communities th at have no people that give them support ...\" \"I think what's really sad, too, kind of like what you were saying, people live in certain apartment complex, and then someone comes in and buys them, fixes them up, and then jacks the rent up. And now they're 40 0 to 500 extra monthly. The people who are living there can't afford it, so they have to leave and find other places to live. \" \"And I don't think there's a lot of HUD housing and oh there's not enough for these people that we need. So instead there's thes e big buildings that are like $1,200 a month for a one bedroom. Build, you know, condominiums for women and children and people who are pregnant. You know what I mean? Build all that for the communities that have so much, women, children, families out on the streets seeking shelters for hope. And then they're overcrowded, and they're pushed back, and they're pushed away. So I see a lot of that going on. \" \"Like the gentrification issue. So it is really great that this area of Franklinton is being built up, but where all those native Franklinton people to go then? They're getting booted out. \" \"So he says equal housing. So that means like, the place you live is the same as this person and this person, but that's not the case. They're slumlords. And there's pe ople who just don't want to... take care of property. It's barely livable...causing all the low self -esteem for the people who live in the neighborhood. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 40 Education Indicators This section describes education indicators including the highest educational level attained by adult residents , kindergarten readiness, 3rd grade reading proficiency , and graduation rates .

The state of Ohio uses the Kindergarten Readiness Assessment (KRA) to determine if students are ready for kindergart en. Students' scores can place them into one of three bands, with Band 1 - Emerging in Readiness, Band 2 - Approaching Readiness, and Band 3 - Demonstrating Readiness . Those scoring in Bands 2 and 3 are considered ready for kindergarten. As measured by the Ohio Department of Education , 76.3 % of Franklin County children score in Bands 2 and 3 of Ohio's Kindergarten Readiness Assessment.

They did mention how those with lower levels of formal education may be less confident asking questions related to their health in medical visits and engaging in self -advocacy. Communities need more accessible and quality education about how to be healthy , involving nutrition, vaccines, and life skills like money management. \"So we have mentioned the understanding of being able to be healthy and have an understanding of nutrition, right? And that's important to know how to be healthy, but somebody has to teach you that, right? And so if people don't have that access to education, they don't have access to what I would argue is the currency of freedom...It's the freedom to be able to make decisions that you want to make versus you'd have to make. It's the freedom to understand the implications of the decisions that you make down the line. \" \"If access t o formal education is one [issue], then access to quality information is two. Whether I have a formal education or not, if I have access to the type of information that can educate myself on the things that I need, that's equally important. There's a value to that, that I think we underestimate because making information available to people, there's information in all of these informal spaces that we don't capitalize on to make sure people are able to educate themselves on the issues that matter to them. \" \"We need to be informed in a way in which the layman can understand. \" \"My country has a better understanding about vaccination than this country, and it's really like a third world. How is that possible? I mean, honestly, how is that possible? This countr y has a lot of potential to do things way better. But the point is, we're targeting political issues, money issues, instead of health issues. \" \"I think that health information needs to be given out more consistently on a regular basis and needs to be on the TV. \" \"But exposure to other things really lacks, you know, in some communities, where you have children, no one's ever even seen what zucchini looks like or vegetables outside of their dreams? You know, I mean, things like that. So, it's like exposure sometimes that doesn't exist in formal education, or just education period .\" \"Sometimes in the schools, some of the stuff like that is irrelevant for some kids. Everybody's not going to be a rocket scientist, so they need to teach how to live your life a fter you get out of school. Daily living, how to manage your money... \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 47 The level of self -advocacy individuals engage in when it comes to medical care may be reflective of the skills learned in formal education. \"I know my aunt, she doesn't like to ask questions because she's not very confident. She has a high school education, so I knew she was not going to ask the right questions [at her doctor's appointment] ...I feel like when people lack education, they don't inquire. They feel a little intimidated, so they just accept whatever the medical professional tells them as the gospel truth. No, you need to question. You need to ask. This is what you need to say, and I write things down for her. She still doesn't, so I have to actually show up. \" \"There's a sense of self advocacy that you can't necessarily express what you're thinking. When you're in these moments of high pressure, when you're hearing bad news about your child from your pediatrician, you'll just be like , 'Okay, uh - huh, yes .' But you forget to ask, 'Why am I taking this medicine? How is it going to make it better? What should I do if I see these x, y, and z ?' ...They don't ask questions about who's going to be there, how long is it going to take. And that comes with this special level of training that happens from your parents, but also it happens in school to be okay to ask. \" \"They can go all the way through whatever levels of education, but if we're not giving people the tools to think for themselves, t hey're thinking about asking this question, they're like, 'Well, why is that like that? What does that mean ?' Even stuff like what does that mean. So that critical thinking that often happens later on in education, but can happen earlier in school, can be inserted into any curriculum. Critical thinking is important to self -advocacy. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 48 Employment Indicators This section describes employment indicators that are related to other social determinants and future health outcomes , namely employment status and occupation .

On the following pages , non-White community members detail the impact that racial and ethnic identities have on their health outcomes, and how racism forms barriers to achieving their full health potential. Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 51 Community Voices on Racial Barriers to Health Equity Community members spoke about their experiences being Black and African American, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino in Franklin County. They see race impacting health in the quality of medical care received, increased mental stress and untreated mental illness , and the way structural racism forms communities with inadequate basic needs: like safety and access to nutrition. Community members recounted personal experiences of feeling their race influenced them to get a low quality of care at a medical facility. Being perceived as a racial stereotype, having their demographic unrepresented in medical staff , and needing a translator for services can result in racial and ethnic minorities havi ng a poor experience with the health care system. \"I heard a lot of stories where people died from lack of care in a hospital. They don't even check on you or they just treat you a certain type of way. I just heard a lot of stories this year about stuff like that happening in hospitals. And [African Americans] are not examined...However, I went to the urgent care at least two to three different times because of what was going on. At least two of those three times, I was not even examined. \" \"She sai d she was near death pretty much, and they weren't believing her, and I think it probably has a lot to do with the color of her skin. \" \"I get treated like that, like, 'Oh, it's not time yet, ' or 'Oh, we do see you have a whole bunch of cysts on your ovari es, but we're going to give you some Tylenol. Go home. ' And so I don't know what else it is. And I can feel it when they're in my face , I can feel it, like they think I just want medicine. And it's a big problem. And I know many, many African American wome n who deal with that, especially at the emergency room, in the hospital, where you're going because you don't have another choice. It's a sick, sad problem. \" \"We don't trust our doctors because we think that they just put us in a group...or we are illegal aliens to them that don't matter. Oh, you're Hispanic and Latina? I get scared to check that mark sometimes on paper. \" \"She touched on it a bit about not seeing people who look like you. You know, that is a big difference for people. It does perpe tuate a lack of trust or that massive fear. And so, you know, I have several friends in the medical field. Like OB or nurse midwives and nurses. I think it's about less than 10% here in the state of Ohio are Black women, as far as OB. But look how many Black women there are here or even Latina women. A lot of times, you see a White man. \" \"From what my friends have told me, some doctors are really accommodating. They really want to treat the patient well. Other doctors are annoyed that they have to try to communicate with somebody through a translator. So I think that adds another level of how well a person feels like they're being treated or how well they actually are being treated based on language barrier. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 52 Community members spoke about the mental strain of dealing with racism and other forms of discrimination , and the compounding issue of stigma related to seeking help for poor mental health. \"That's another reason why there's so much drug addiction, so much drinking and es capism and not watching politics, unfortunately. It's because life is so incredibly burdensome living here [as a Black person]. \" \"Well, as an Asian person, I think that it has greatly affected the Asian community. Ever since President Trump had said that it was the Wuhan virus or the China virus, there have been so many more attacks on the Asian community and more questions to me...So I think that it does magnify the virus in that you feel like you're getting blamed for it in a way, which is very unfair, b ut also, you have this anxiety and stress of the virus itself. And so it just magnifies the issues. \" \"There's a thing called the chronic stress hypothesis, which thinks about things like racism and the way that it systemically functions in our society, right? So being a Black woman in America, being a Black man in America, being an Asian woman in America, r egardless, the additional stress that comes from the racism you get...So over time, the thought is that the additional stress creates a chronic stress response that is going to cause communities of color not only to have increased rates of like low birth w eight and preterm babies and diabetes, but there are some other genetic predispositions that can be turned on by chronic stress, then we end up with issues like increased risk of dementia, increased risk of mental illness, increased risk of heart disease. \" \"Especially the mixed children. They are very confused if they're White or Black . When they go to school, they're Black , but they know themselves - That's one part of it, but when someone's just saying, 'You're Black , you're Black , you're Black ,' and th ey go in the world just confused. The parents don't talk to them about certain things that they will encounter when they get into the world. Okay, at home, you know that you're mixed, but out in the world, you're going to be labeled Black . So that gets int o their brain, and they deal with that in school because they don't know if they should hang out with White children or Black children. And the White children are not as accepting .\" \"And there's stigma associated with seeking mental health for men as well, or men of color, but different, than women because we are mainly the caretakers of the home and the kids. And so like, if you don't have yourself straight, how are you going to be like taking care of other people. And there's a major, major fear and sometimes misconception about you speaking up, and getting the help you need for saying that you're having a hard time and your kids are going to be taken away to CPS , yes, that's a real thing. Yes, people do come in and take your children away, but it's n ot as rampant ...\" \"And even in like as we were growing up, we were shown not to show a lot of like emotions to other people. So we're not supposed to show any empathy, any anything like emotional wise. So I think it's like when it comes to Hispanic culture, I think that's where they come from. They're taught a lot about not showing what you're actually feeling .\" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 53 Community members talked about how racism makes people feel unsafe, and how neighborhoods with large populations of racial minorities do not have access to the same resources found in predominantly White neighborhoods. \"So the comfort some of us might feel going outside to go for a jog to stay healthy and fit might not be re ceived the same way in different neighborhoods for people of different color. So I think police violence, obviously, as a whole is a systematic health problem to communities, too. \" \"You walk in the door as a Black person, light, brown, dark, light, whatever, you're suddenly a criminal from the get -go. And all of a sudden, the burden is on us to try and prove to you we're one of the good ones. \" \"Maybe it's a matter of the interpretation of the idea of a health cris is. But I mean, there's obvious systemic violence against Black bodies in all communities across America. On behalf of police, on behalf of other community members. I cannot speak to access to health care being a racial issue other than maybe socio -economi c status. But I can certainly see that if we're talking about health on a broad scale, that like violence against Black and people of color is obviously an everyday issue in America everywhere. \" \"They're looking at different pockets of areas and look at w here certain money went. It was like okay; we'll look at this area. This is probably a more White area. This is probably more a nicer area. Things of that sort. So from my experience it won't play a factor face to face, but as we go and look at the stats b y the numbers, you'll see a disparity where one area might be more predominantly White , or one area might be more diverse. \" \"There's even less opportunity for healthy food than there is in more upper -class neighborhoods ...m ost of the customers in that store are foreigners, okay? So, they can throw, they think they can throw that off on them, those old vegetables and stuff and they buy them. \" \"You don't see the meals and the vegetables that's needed in the communities, when you know the health risks are high er. Data proves that especially in communities of color, and African American communities alone, that have high blood pressure, Diabetes, and heart disease are number one. But yet still, you take this door and accessibility away from me that now I have to travel to somewhere where I can't go.

Key Findings Health Resource Availability Franklin County residents now have gre ater access to certain types of health care providers (advance practice nurses, physician assistants ). Emergency Health Care Utilization The rate of utilizing emergency rooms for the lowest severity issues decreased since the previous HealthMap . Combining all types of visits, Black and African American residents utilize emergency care at higher rates than other groups. Mental Health Resource Availability Mental health providers have higher ratios of residents to a single practitioner, compared to other types of health practitioners . Community members may face additional difficulty finding a practitioner who can relate to their experiences. Dental Care Access The percent of adults unable to access needed dental care increased since the previous HealthMap. Health Resource Availability, continued 59 HEALTH RESOURCE AVAILABILITY The ratio of Franklin County residents per licens ed physicians (MDs and DOs) is similar to the last HealthMap , with a current ratio of 238:1 , meaning one licensed physician available for every 238 residents. In 2019 the number of residents per licensed physicians was 2 34. However, there has been improvement in the number of advance practice nurses and physician assistants per resident, with ratios decreasing for each of these practitioners. The ratio of Franklin County residents per optometrists has also improved slightly, with a current ratio of one optometrist per 3,530 residents, compared to one optometrist per 3,639 residents in the previous Health Map. Health Care Providers Franklin Co unty Ohio HM2016 Community Voices on Health Resource Availability In addition to the number of health care professionals available per resident, health resource availability also depends on the ease of scheduling and making it to appointments . Community members recounted difficulty finding a medical professional with hours that work with their schedule , specifically the difficulty of managing health appointments along with their work responsibilities. Health Resource Availability, continued 60 \"Right now, if I needed to go to the doctor, I have so much going on. I work with a special project that I can't afford to miss a day of work right now or a couple hours of work to go to the doctor. So that's a reason. If my doctor doesn't have any evening or very late afternoon hours, then it's not likely that I would g et healthcare in until my project is done .\" \"And I think a lot of that is actual employers. I know some people would come to work sick and not go to the doctor. But I work in a new place now, and I remember feeling like, I need to take off for this. And m y supervisor was like, 'Oh, great. ' It's approved. Any time you need to go do something for your health, it's approved. And I'm like, 'Whoa .' But you feel like you can't take that time off. You don't feel encouraged to really take care of yourself because work comes first. And I think getting employers to understand that people feel like that, but they should not make people feel like that would be really helpful, too. \" \"Doctors have pretty much turned into an 8 to 5 service. \" Community members spoke about the benefit of having a medical professional available by phone to help when they aren't sure if they need to see a doctor, and to answer questions quickly. While t he COVID -19 pandemic led to increased use of telemedicine options in place of in person appointments , telemedicine has its own barriers to accessibility. It can be difficul t for members of the population to access \"virtual visits\" if they have trouble utilizing the technology involved (community members mentioned this specifically for the elderly population) , and if they are without the necessary equipment or Internet bandwidth to participate in a telemedicine visit. \"And even being able to pick up your phone and talk to a healthcare professional who's going to tell you, 'Okay, tell me, what are your symptoms? Do you have a thermometer? Can you take your temperature ?' And you see if this is happening or that is happening, and then they will make a recommendation. And sometimes they're even able to send it to a doctor in your area so that when you go to the doctor, they're pre pared for what's going on with you. \" \"Like my insurance, I do have that, but what about people who don't have health insurance? They have a number I could call and even get the best doctor or ask those type of questions to a nurse, but that's for me because I have health insurance. But if you don't, you're kind of stuck going to the emergency room or going to urgent care. And when I did not have healthcare, I would go to the emergency room if I really needed to. And sometimes I just wasn't believed th at I was either this sick or in this much pain or, 'Oh, go see your primary care .' I don't have a primary care doctor, so you're the doctor I'm coming to see, but you're not believing what I'm saying. So now I'm at a loss. \" Health Resource Availability, continued 61 MENTAL HEALTH RESOU RCE AVAILABILITY The table on page 59 show s the ratio s of Franklin County residents per licensed psychiatrists, psychologists, and chemical counselors. While ratios have decreased (improved) for both chemical counselors and psychologists per resident, the ratio has increased for psychiatrists. The ratio of Franklin County residents per chemical counselor is 919 residents per chemical counselor compared to 1,137 residents in the previous HealthMap . The ratio of residents per psychologist is 2,258 residents per psychologist compared to 2,379 residents in the p revious HealthMap . While this hopefully represents improvements in access for those in need of psychotherapy and chemical counseling for substance abuse issues, residents with more severe mental illness requiring medical treatments and prescription drugs m ay have less access to this than they did in 2019. The ratio of residents per psychiatrists is 7,152:1, compared to 6,836:1 in the previous HealthMap . Community Voices on Mental Health Resource Availability For mental health treatment to be most effective, some community members wan t a counselor who can relate to their experiences. However, this can be hard to find. \"One of the other things that's a challenge is, for me, for example, when my first wife died nine years ago, I went to four counselo rs because I could not find a counselor that shared my lived experience enough to relate to what I was going through. \" \"So for example, in Columbus, specifically Franklin County, there's not many Black male counselors, and if that's something that you're looking for, that limitation contributes to your access. \" \"I understand why people might say, 'I need to find somebody that looks and sounds like me that will help me navigate my issues ,' but that can be a strong barrier. \" Community members are unsure how to seek out he lp when they feel like they need treatment. \"There still is a lack of information on what do if you think you have a substance abuse problem? What do you do if you think you're dealing with severe depression or anxiety or this or that? There's just not a lot of information on what steps to take after that. \" \"There can be an overload of information. Because it's like you're saying how you can go to WebMD, and you can look up certain things ...there's s o much different information out there. It brings you back to the point where if you have some anxiety and depression, and you're looking at all of this information, it's like you're just even more...overwhelmed, confused ...\" Health Resource Availability, continued 62 \"I don't think that people out here would know where to start if they had a mental health issue. Like if they wanted to follow up with that and see a provider, I don't know if they even know where to look, or to reach out to. \" \"I think sometimes if you can't, like physically see th e problem, you don't know when it's time to ask for help and like, look or get help. \" \"Cities and communities need to be working together to educate what you can get help for and what is available now. But when you have eliminated all the aspects of no ed ucation, nobody really working with each other, people pushing you off, and then the healthcare industry treats it as a luxury. You just have people who are suffering and causing suffering. \" EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION The ED data presented in this report are for Franklin County residents who visited any Ohio emergency department and Ohio residents who visited any Ohio emergency department in calendar year 2019. ED utilization can be representative of health resource av ailability due to individuals seeking care from the ED because they lack another known place to receive treatment . This can occur if they do not have a regular health care provider or have additional issues receiving care from another source. While the prevalence of using EDs for this reason is not apparent from current data, the existence of these cases can be inferred somewhat from the data collected on ED case severity, shown in next table . When patients are seen in the ED, they are assigned a \"seve rity\" rating between 1 and 5, with 1 being the least severe and 5 being the most severe. Level 1 health issues are \"self -limited or minor,\" Level 2 issues are of \"low to moderate severity,\" Level 3 issues are of \"moderate severity,\" Level 4 issues are of \" high severity, and require urgent evaluation by the physician but do not pose an immediate threat to life or physiologic function\" and Level 5 issues \"are of high severity and pose an immediate significant threat to life or physiologic function.\" Health Resource Availability, continued 63 Emergency Department Visits10 Franklin County Ohio HM2016 HM2019 HM2022 HM2022 Severity of Emergency Department Visits Level 1 (minor severity) - 10.0 8.0 6.7 Level 2 (low to moderate severity) - 52.8 51.7 43.4 Level 3 (moderate severity) - 161.3 162.0 173.2 Level 4 (high severity, urgent evaluation required) - 142.7 134.9 143.7 Level 5 (high severity, immediate threat to life or function) - 94.1 92.2 104.6 Rate per 1,000 population who were treated and released by emergency departments The total number of ED visits per 1,000 people in Franklin County has decreased since the last HealthMap (608.8 to 511.33 ) and is slightly less than the statewide rate. When breaking down ED visits by those who were treated and released versus those who were admitted into a hospital , the rate of patients who were treated and released decreased since the last HealthMap, while the rate of patients who were admitted into a hospital remained mostly similar. The rate of individuals age 65 and older utilizing emergency department s (both treated and released and admitted into the hospital ) increased since the last HealthMap .

Health Behaviors 67 This section describes some behaviors of Franklin County residents that affect health outcomes, including substance use and behaviors around nutrition and physical activity . Key Findings Nutrition Most Franklin County residents eat vegetables at least once a day, however, over 20% still do not. Substance Use While illicit drug use appears to have decreased in Franklin County, deaths due to overdoses have increased since the last HealthMap. Physical Activity A majority of residents do not engage in enough physical activity to meet national guidelines. Health Behaviors, continued 68 Substance Use The percentage of Franklin County adults who are current smokers ( 22.7 %) remains similar to the last HealthMap (21.9%). The percentage of Franklin County adults who are heavy drinkers (i.e., more than 15 drinks per week for men ; more tha n 8 drinks per week for women) is also similar to th e previous HealthMap .

The percentage of Franklin County adults who identify as binge drinkers (i.e., five or more drinks on one occasion in the past month for men; four or more drinks on one occasion in the past month for women) also remains similar to the last HealthMap, and s imilar to statewide and national percentages. Franklin County: 18.5 %1 Target: 25.4%3 Percent of adults 21 and older who binge drank in the past 30 days Health Behaviors, continued 69 Community Voices on Alcohol Use Community members kn ow about the negative effects of alcohol on overall health and safety, and some have personal experience witnessing people they know dying or losing mobility and the ability to take care of themselves due to alcoholism. The major barriers community members see in terms of decreasing commu nity alcohol abuse and its long -term health effects include a normalized drinking culture and alcohol's function as a cheap replacement to medical care for issues ranging from mental to physical. Community members explained that the popularity of alcohol as a fun pastime along with its visibility in the community can overshadow its dangerous effects . This can also allow alcohol addiction to fly under the radar. \"We have normalized drinking so much that it's a part of our culture. \" \"I think there's probably a pretty big drinking culture in Columbus...you always hear about new bars and stuff opening. I just think about some people I know, like friends, neighbors tha t I have, who, it's a big part of life for a lot of people. And it might be at a point where they could be still getting up for their job every day and they're high functioning, but it's clearly taking -- Either they're drinking too much or it's starting t o take a toll on things...but it's a lot more pervasive maybe behind closed doors that people realize. \" \"Every Kroger's has an actual liquor store. Every Giant Eagle. It's part of your grocery shopping basically, and they put it right in the middle so you have to go by it no matter what. They act like alcohol is not alcohol or something, like it doesn't have an effect on you. It's so normalized. But then if someone is struggling with opioids, oh my God. You know what I mean? \" \"You celebrate, you drink . You're sad, you drink . You're mad, you drink; you want to chill, you drink. \" \"Social media has also glamorized [alcohol] . Like Casamigos has been the drink of the year and summer. \" Community members felt it was common to use alcohol to combat mental issues , and some people may use it in place of medical attention they cannot afford. \"Talking about mental issues, too, a lot of people use alcohol to take care of their mental issues .\" \"[They use alcohol to deal with] depression, anxiety.\" \"I've got friends in my neighborhood who can't afford to get like a root canal done. So they'll be like, 'I'll just drink whiskey until I can't feel it. ' Just using it in place of a lot of times that someone would have used medicine. \" Health Behaviors, continued 70 In Franklin County, trends of illicit drug use are lower than the previous HealthMap , apart from the use of marijuana , which has remained similar . Trends have also decrease d in dependency /abuse of illicit drugs and non-medical use of pain relievers. Illicit Drug Use * Franklin County Ohio USA HM2016 HM2019 HM2022 HM2022 HM2022 Illicit Drug Use 3.0% 2.6% 2.7% 2.9% the general civilian population aged 12 and older . Community Voices on Illicit Drug Use Community members highlighted heroin, fentanyl, meth, opioids, and marijuana in their discussions about illicit substance use , and also expressed concern about overdoses from heroin and other substances . The issues community members raised related to these substances mainly focused on their use as a coping mechanism in stead of mental health care, financial hardships that contribute to the sale of drugs in the community , and the difficulty of ensuring long -term recovery for those in need of treatment for substance issues . Community members mentioned the ability of drugs to make people feel better mentally and emotionally , as a cause of drug use and abuse . Curiosity was also mentioned as a reason for drug use. \"Using more drugs as a means of coping. \" \"They don't really have a support system and it can be a way out. \" \"I see people using [marijuana] in lieu of medicine sometimes. Like in times that you need, say like Zoloft or antianxiety medication, just smoking weed so that I feel more calm, or I feel like there's less going on in my mind .\" \"To address chronic pain, you know, grieving a loss, just don't want to deal with it.\" \"I'm so mad I'm gonna get high so I don't care about it. \" Health Behaviors, continued 71 \"Some just try drugs because they're curious. \" Community members highlighted how financial hardships contribute to the presence of drugs in their community. \"People buying their medication and taking what they need and then selling the rest so they can have more and get it legally, even though they'r e selling it illegally, whether it's ketamine or Percocet, Darvocet, any of that opioid family. \" \"So I do know that in my neighborhood, there's at least one house that we have kind of thought maybe selling drugs from their house. And these people had jobs previously, and now they don't, so unfortunately, I think that's something that they've had to turn to .\" \"Yes, I know there's people selling drugs, drug houses. What do you do when your neighbor stays home all day and sells drugs? What do you do? That's something you see in your communities. Do you report him every month? \" They also see addiction issues firsthand in their communities, and perceive treatment is not happening at the point it should . Community members felt that those in power could make changes to improve treatment and recovery outcomes. \"I see a lot of people that are functioning drug addicts, and I had no idea...And it's normal, and these are hard drugs that can really do a lot of damage, and peopl e are just doing it, going to their six -figure job and coming back home and abusing it. \" \"There is a house in the neighborhood that the emergency squad apparently used to be at less frequently, but this specific person overdoses probably once a week. \" \"Every off ramp and traffic light that has three or four different people with signs about being homeless or a veteran or needing help or whatever. And looking, you know that there's a there's a drug addiction issue that's going on. There's no citywide effo rt...There are things that can be done. It's not compassionate to let addicts live on the streets begging for money all day when there's other ways that other cities have addressed that that we're not necessarily doing here in central Ohio. \" \"There's a lady that I've literally seen ...sleeping in [the street]. During the day she just sits there. And I don't know. She's on something, obviously, but they're also asking policemen to drive by ...I just don't understand how the community can't do better. It doesn't se em like the police cares. It's just like they just drive by and go, 'Well, that's normal .' \" \"Affordable housing [matters] . I was thinking more so like homelessness, and the people that are in the street, and then that's all they are is in the street. So they're going to meet those people that are in the street. \" Health Behaviors, continued 72 Community members disagreed about the amount of recovery options available but agreed that recovery is difficult if there is not attention to the underlying issues contributing to drug use and relearning healthy coping mechanisms. \"So you start doing drugs, how do you stop. What are the options now, there's so few recovery options.\" \"A lot of these facilities are not doing well, and they're not really getting great results so far with peo ple that have been struggling with addiction their whole life, like they go to these things are so underfunded, they are they barely get the attention they need, and then they're back out.\" \"There's not a lack of recovery options, but you have to make you rself clean. I can't make you get no cleaner than what you want to be. If you come back out and use drugs it's because you wanted to.\" \"Whatever you're trying to not face by drowning into any kind of substance, you are going to have to face it, and if you want to correct it, you have to face it. So if you keep denying that that thing is happening to you, then you will not find the solution because you don't want to face it.\" \"Like we were talking about, what options are there for you for help? That are really going to help, are you really going to be able to unlearn bad habits or unhealthy behavior and be taught other coping mechanisms?\" YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE Thus far, the statistics for alcohol, tobacco, and other substance use presented in HealthMap2022 have focused on Franklin County adults. Unfortunately, recent and reliable data are unavailable for these types of health behaviors among Franklin County youth. To provide a possible view into the prevalence of these health behaviors among Franklin County' s high schoolers, the infographic shown on the next page presents Ohio -level information from its 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Health Behaviors, continued 73 Tobacco Use8 Among Ohio High School Students (2019) Measure Statistic Racial/ethnic differences? Ever tried cigarette smoking 21.5% None observed Currently smoke cigarettes 4.9% None observed Ever used electronic vapor products 47.7% Higher prevalence among White or Hispanic students vs. Black students (50.1% 46.1%, & 36.6% respectively) Currently use vapor products 29.8% Higher prevalence among White students vs. Black students (32.1% & 19.4% respectively) Alcohol And Other Drug Use9 Among Ohio High School Students (2019) Measure Statistic Racial/ethnic differences?

This means that out of 100,000 Franklin County residents, over 40 die each year due to drugs or medication. This is higher than the rate in the state of Ohio (36. 4), which had a similar rate of deaths since the last HealthMap (36.8). Health Behaviors, continued 74 The recent increase in overdose deaths in Franklin County from fentanyl mirro rs statewide patterns. In 20 20, the opioid overdose antidote drug Narcan was administered 6,239 times in Franklin County. Franklin County deaths due to Opiates, Cocaine, and Alcohol also increased since the previous HealthMap . Rates of death due to Heroin and Benzodiazepines decreased during this same time period.

Community Voices on Substance Abuse For all types of substance use, the financial impacts are profound, and addiction can set off and contribute to a cycle of poverty. \"I definitely think financial ramifications of any type of substance abuse is one of the biggest issues. If you're abusing alcohol, if you're abusing marijuana or pills or whatever the substance is, a lot of your financial resources go towards that, which causes you not to be able to sustain your home, which cause s you not to buy your groceries, which in turn, you're losing your kids. \" \"People's lives have been turned upside down because they smoke too much marijuana. They spend their whole check in a day, but that comes down to Health Behaviors, continued 75 abuse because, on the other hand, m arijuana can help someone who does not have an appetite, who can't eat, or someone who is going through chemotherapy or whatever it may be. But I do agree with what she said, it's been normalized, like the abuse of it and how much money people do spend on it because I have seen people who will spend their whole check on it. And they're fine because they're smoking it until it's gone. And now they're like, 'I have no money .' I think they do go hand in hand. \" Community members expressed concern about how substance use in genera l impacts younger generations exposed to it through their elders. \"If their kid comes in and sees them. And it normalizes it for that, and they think it's okay. \"It's always going to go back to the kids for me. Substance abuse, I think it may be like the number two reason that kids are in the system, doesn't have a parent or a guardian. It's like the family that also causes trauma for those kids. Then they have to figure out how to cope with that trauma. And the way they know to cope with the trauma is what they've seen, and that's drugs and alcohol. So it's like thi s vicious cycle, but I think the biggest consequence is how it affects families, specifically kids .\" Community members also expressed concern that substance use and abuse increased due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Many community members commented that eithe r boredom from socialization decreasing, or worsened mental health brought on by isolation and increased stress led to more frequent substance use, from alcohol to drugs. Health Behaviors, continued 76 Nutrition Over 40% of Franklin County residents eat fruit less than one time per day, similar to rates in the previous HealthMap . The percentage of residents eating vegetables less than once per day remains over 20%, also similar to the previous HealthMap . Fruit and Ve getable HM2016 HM2019 HM2022 HM2022 HM2022 Consumed fruit day 40.9% 45.2% 43.7% 42.7% 39.3% Consumed vegetables day 26.1% 24.3% 22.1% 20.2% 20.3% Community Voices on Nutrition When asked about nutritional issues, community members spoke to numerous barriers affecting individual s' abilities to develop and/or maintain healthy eating habits. These issues can be collapsed into two broad categories : the availability of healthy foods in the community ; and individuals' willingness to eat healthy foods . However, t hese are not discrete issues , as the difficulty in sourcing and preparing healthy foods is seen to contribute to preferences for fast food or \"easier,\" unhealthy options. Youth suffer the nutritional consequences of these issues along with their parents or guardians. Community members stated that having access to grocery stores is essential to eating healthy . By contrast, corner stores often don't have nutritious foods, and restaurants cannot guarantee this at an affordable price . \"If you go to one of the corner stores, they might have it in the back, but you don't want it because you don't know how long it's been in there. If you're not in the grocery store, you're not going to find [fruits and vegetables].\" \"There's nowhere around me. I live in an area with tons of restaurants, tons of cafes. I try hard. T here's nowhere for me to go to get a healthy meal that doesn't require hours of planning, cooking, and grocery shopping. Or that's not like $20 for a lettuce wrap.\" However, grocery stores are not accessible enough, particularly in low -income neighborhoods. Healthy fast -food options are not common enough either. Health Behaviors, continued 77 \"It's a mile and a half to get to the closest grocery store by my house. But you can get the five different conven ience marts or, you know, four or five different fast food places within walking and biking distance ...If you've got somebody who doesn't have a vehicle, you know, and the temperature is hot, they can't get necessarily to the grocery store, but you know, the y could walk to the corner store and get frozen pizza or a bag of chips a whole lot easier. \" \"The accessibility [to grocery stores] is not equitable. It's not something that is offered. It's not something that is encouraged in certain neighborhoods. \" \"As well as you can tell the difference of the neighborhood that you're in by your fast-food restaurants. There's not a lot of healthy fast -food options. in certain neighborhoods. You have to drive other places to get a good vegetarian meal or to get to other meals other than chicken. \" Community members also mentioned access to the grocery store is an issue for the elderly population. One comment spoke about this in the context of COVID -19, where relying on other people for help grocery shopping became difficult. However, this lack of access may extend in general to this population and others with less mobility. The food in grocery stores is also not guaranteed to be fresh and available when people need it . Some travel farther than the ir closest grocery to find the produce they need. The poor shelf life of produce found at some stores can also make people feel like they are wasting their money. \"I'll drive to a grocery store farther from my house just to get the vegetables and fruit that I want because they don't even carry them at the grocery store.\" \"And then it's not fresh, and there's n o diversity. I don't want to go to my local Kroger because they have only a set amount of produce, and then that produce is not even fresh, so I have to travel farther.\" \"The thing is, food don't last as long anymore. You go to a grocery store...In two days, you're about to cook, and it's spoiled. And that's why people rather go out or order out because it's like wasting money on the grocery store, or you feel like it's a waste.\" People also questioned the \"health\" of different packaged foods or produce they buy from the grocery store. Concerns about false labeling and genetic modification frustrated some community members. \"About the food, we don't know what we're eating these days. I bought salad or lettuce the other day. And when I went home and I opened up the package, it felt like plastic. I'm like, we don't know what we're consuming. It says organic ...and we think we're buying organic but we're really not. It's trash.\" Health Behaviors, continued 78 \"And going back to what you said about greed, just the GMO, that's all about it. So they push that food overseas. They all say no, so they give it to us. So we're the ones that kind of keep all that food that's been modified. It's definitely not healthy.\" \"I also think in the packaged foods, there's kind of sugar in everything, and so even if something's not a sugary food, there's sugar snuck into it. And that all adds up to this load of sugar that people are consuming maybe not even knowing.\" Community members discussed alternative sources to the grocery store, inc luding community gardens and farmer's markets. However , some participants expressed that the community discussion was the first time they had heard of these food sources in the community. Community gardens and farmer's markets may be unknown to a large por tion of a neighborhood's population and have other barriers to utilization. Community members said when it comes to preparing healthy food, not everyone has knowledge in cooking and nutrition to do this effectively . \"I think there's just like a broad lack of education about what the nutrition is for people. I never learned in school or from my parent s the macronutrients you should be eating or how to cook for yourself, how to source these things. It's certainly not taught in school that I'm aware of.\" \"So you get young adults out on their own, and if you can't cook, you don't know how to make a pot of rice, some simple things. You don't come out of the womb knowing how to do that, but if you weren't taught...\" \"Even if you did have it, there's a lack of knowledge on how to prepare it. You could have a whole bunch of fresh produce and you're like, 'I don't know what to do with it .' So then you're stuck going to a fast -food restaurant or some other restaurant that may have it on their menu, and then they're selling at a higher price when we ourselves don't even know how to cook it.\" Eating healthy by sourcing and preparing nutritious food takes effort and is work . After their actual job, people take advantage of efficient fast -food options that allow them to rest. Media may also play a role in drawing people away from cooking at home. \"Another thing is that we want everythi ng right now, too. People don't want to take the time to prepare a nice wholesome meal. You just want to get something real quick. You've had a long day at work. Let's just order out.\" \"Like we're rewarded for grinding, so to speak. For constantly being moving 40/50/60/70/80 hours a week...The last thing you want to do is go home and fix anything that takes more than 20 minutes, you know. So that means that you're eating out of a vending machine. You're ordering out of a drive thru.\" Health Behaviors, continued 79 \"Ever y time we turn the TV on whatever, we're trying to work out, we have the issue where everything's like 4 for 4 so everything is so easy for people to stop making food at home and it's healthier. The fast -food option is being pushed in our faces too much.\" Speaking to youth nutrition, community members emphasized that children are not taught how to practice healthy eating habits at home or at school. Media directed to kids involving fast food may also make this lesson more difficult to ingrain. If left unchecked these issues contribute to obesity and malnourishment that lead to larger health issues. \"I think it's such a cycle, too in families. If they were brought up being like 'fast food for dinner ,' they're most likely to do that with their kid s.\" \"Also, working in a school, the food they're feeding them is not good. The breakfast they're getting is like a cinnamon roll, not healthy breakfast options. I don't know. I feel like that needs to change.\" \"Food can definitely be a barrier, especially when you have young children and you're trying to teach them how to eat properly, and they see McDonalds and happy meal places and Barbie 'works ' at Starbucks.\" \"Obesity, but malnutrition. So a kid could be m orbidly obese on Twinkies. And so like vitamin, nutrient deficiency and how that affects their teeth, their vision, their hair falling out, like their attention, their ability to stay alert, or to sleep or not sleep.\" To improve youth nutritional outcomes, community members pointed to example s set by other countries and other solutions to teach children about healthy foods. \"[In Canada] they're invested heavily in educating the parents to give healthy food to their kids just so people will be healthy and the cost of healthcare doesn't rise. So it would be nice to have something similar. I don't know if I'm going to be alive when it happens...t here was absolutely no candy at schools, a no candy policy. So we learned at an early age to demand those healthy habits, eating fruits and vegetables. \" \"It would really be nice to find those farmers and get food to the schools and have some people volunteer to help chefs set up a menu that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, but yet has all the nu trients that the kids need. It might not be very expensive, but put some help from volunteers or be able to come up with some menus that are healthy for kids .\" \"I used to work at a school, and one of the teachers actually took it upon himself to create a garden at the school. He had a garden club and taught the kids how to grow fruits and vegetables that they could eat for healthier options, but also grew stuff that could be served at the school for breakfast and lunch. \" Health Behaviors, continued 80 Physical Activity Under one quarter of Franklin County residents meet aerobic and strength guidelines (22% ). According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, adults who meet these guidelines engage in at least 1.25 hours of vigorous -intensity exercis e or 2.5 hours of moderate -intensity exercise weekly and muscle strengthening exercises at least twice a week .14 In Franklin County and Ohio, y outh aged 18 -24 have the highest percentage of individuals meeting these guidelines . Similarly in both Franklin County and Ohio, the percentage of individuals meeting the guidelines tends to increase as household income and educational attainment increase. Meets Physical Activity Guidelines13 Franklin County Ohio Franklin County Ohio HM2022 HM2022 school - 11.0% Black, -Hispanic 20.6% 21.3% HS diploma or 18.6% Some college 26.3% -Hispanic - 28.7% College graduate 27.0% 26.7% Multi - racial - 30.6% Community Voices on Physical Activity The major barriers community members see when it comes to getting adequate amounts of physical activity are cost and relatedly, the awareness of low -cost activities in their communities. For adults, physical activity comes second to their jobs, and exhaustion after Health Behaviors, continued 81 the workday can be a barrier to pursuing additional physical activity. For youth under 18 , community members repeatedly mentioned the emphasis of technology on health behaviors and habits a round physical activity . They also perceived a lack of community centers , like Boys and Girls Clubs , centered around youth activities at low costs for parents. Community members explained that physical gym memberships and loca l recreational activities can be cost prohibitive . Those with little money to spend to go somewhere for activity may be unaware of discounted opportunities for activities in the area, and community members perceived a lack of advertising for this. \"Gym memberships are expensive. If you want to join a gym - Well, some of them aren't expensive, I guess, but a lot of them are expensive. \" \"More community centers...that would be like on a sliding scale. I think they don't advertise it maybe purposely. But then that kind of hindering a lot of people who don't have the funds to do stuff like that.\" \"I also think there's a lot of information at the city don't necessarily put out that's available out there. For lower income neighborhoods, like y ou can get a family pass to go to the Franklin Park Conservatory for like 40 or 50 bucks. People don't know that. \" \"Some of those places are even free right now. If you are at a library closest to like Franklin Park, there's like a limited amount of passe s for seven days for your whole family for free... So though the conservatory isn't necessarily like physical fitness, right? But it's just getting you up and moving in the city and there is a park there , playground , and you could walk the grounds and get some exercise so there are options they just don't always advertise. \" Community members also perceived an overemphasis on paid recreational activities , while people may not take advantage of the free opportunities, like parks, at their disposal . Transportation issues and having multiple children could make the necessary trips to community assets harder. Feeling unsafe going to a trail or park by yourself was also mentioned by a community memb er. Those who are employed may prioritize rest during their time off from work , leaving them little time and energy to exercise in between other responsibilities. \"A lot of people don't have time to work out because after work, especially with my husband. He gets so drained mentally at work that, when he comes home, he just wants to lay down. Because when you come home, you've dealt with so many things at work . \" \"A lot of people are at their jobs more than they're at home or you could have a physical job. And the two days that they give you off, you're like more trying to calm down from those days than you are doing something. \" Health Behaviors, continued 82 Community members mentioned the impact of technology on promoting sedentary lifestyles in general , but especially for youth. Community members perceive children not to be active, because they rarely see them playing outside. Instead, the children they know seem to spend a disproportionate amount of time online . \"She mentioned something about just the health starting with our kids, with the youth. What I also feel is a huge issue for overall health, physical, emotional, social health, is the fact that our kids are not active. \" \"They're drawn to social media. They don't go outside and play anymore. It's rare that I see children playing, so they're not getting the exercise. \" \"I think we do a good job in Central Ohio of having those outdoor resources, but how much kids actually utilize them, I think, is just really low. And I do think the screen time thing is a huge contributor to that .\" \"I was just amazed by how hard it was to get [my friend's son] away from his iPad. I was like, 'Let's go jump on the trampol ine. Let's go for a bike ride .' And it was like I had to pull him out the door to do those things because he just wanted to be with his iPad. \" \"My nephews are in the house, playing video games .\" \"They're using it [the internet] more, and the more other kids don't play outside, it just dwindles the number down and down because you have less people to play with. So if only one person out of 10 will go outside and play with you, you're probably not going to ask as much. \" Community members perceive a lack of low -cost after school activities for children that include different types of physical activity. \"Growing up, they had Boys and Girls Club on every corner, and that was your after -school program, and you learned how to play a variety of sports. It was structured...there really aren't those types of resources for kids to go to unless you're willing to pay for it, and that was just a free program that was available ...and I found out that I love field hockey that way, and I never would have played that without that... I feel like the only one I know of is Milo Grogan, and that's not necessarily close .\" \"In Canada, we had a community center where everyone knew each other, like if everyone came from the same family and a lot of different activities like speed skating. They would bring up someone to teach them how to fish, all kinds of activities that my children have been exposed to when we were there, and now that I don't have it, I find it so valuable. \" \"I know that the parks and recs, they have their programs, too, but again, that's also pay for each little thing ...So I think like those types of community resources to keep kids active and give them exposure to things that they're interested in outside of the typical footba ll, basketball, baseball, swimming. \" Health Behaviors, continued 83 References 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data , 2019 (HM2022), 2018 (HM2022: e -cigarette and chew tobacco users), 2016 (HM2019), 2013 (HM2016) . 2 Ohio Department of Public Safety Crash Statistics System , Alcohol, Drug, & Fatal Stat istics Report (Franklin County and Ohio), 201 9 (HM2022), 2016 (HM2019) . https://ohtrafficdata.dps.ohio.gov/crashstatistics/home 3 Healthy People 2030 objective SU -10, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 4 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, National Survey on Drug Use and Health (Franklin County), Average of 2018 and 2019 (HM2022), Average of 2011, 2013, and 2014 (HM2019), Average of 2010, 2011, and 2012 (HM2016) 5 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, National Survey on Drug Use and Health (Ohio and United States), Average of 2016, 2017, and 2018 (HM2022), Average of 2015 and 2016 (HM2019), Average of 2013 and 2014 (HM2016) 6 Substan ce Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, National Survey on Drug Use and Health Small Area Estimates (Franklin County), 201 6-2018 (HM2022), 2012 -2014 (HM2019), 2010 -2012 (HM2016) 7 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, National Survey on Drug Use and Health (Ohio and United States), Average of 2018 and 2019 (HM 2022); Average of 2015 and 2016 (HM2019), Average of 20 13 and 2014 (HM2016) 8 Ohio Department of Health, High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey Tobacco and Electronic Vapor Product Use Report, 2019 9 Ohio Department of Health, High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey Substance Use Report, 2019 10 Ohio Emergency Medical Services, Naloxone Administration by Ohio EMS Providers By County, Ohio, 2020 (HM2022), 2017 (HM2019), 2013 (HM2016) 11 Ohio Department of Health, Resident Mortality Data (Franklin County and Ohio), 2019 (HM2022), 2016 (HM2019), 2012 (HM2016); Centers for Di sease Control and Prevention, WISQARS Fatal Injury Data (United States), 2019 (HM2022), 2016 (HM2019), 2012 (HM2016) 12 Ohio Department of Health, Resident Mortality Data (Franklin County and Ohio), 2019 (HM2022), 2016 (HM2019), 2013 (HM2016); National Instit ute on Drug Abuse, Overdose Death Rates (United States), 2019 (HM2022), 2015 (HM2019), 2013 (HM2016) 13 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data, 2019 (HM2022), 2015 (HM2019), 2013 (HM2016) Health Behaviors, continued 84 14 U.S. Depart ment of Health and Human Services.

Maternal and Infant Health 85 Health i ssues facing mothers and their newborn children in Franklin County are described in this section . Key Findings In Franklin County, 127 infants died before their first birthday in 201 9. Overall, the infant mortality rate has decreased since the last HealthMap . However, this rate remains higher than the national rate. The infant mortality rate among infants who are Black has decreased since the last HealthMap (from 15.2 to 11.4 per 1,000 live births ) but remains cons iderably higher than infants who are White (4.3 per 1,000 live births ). Infant Mortality1 Franklin County Ohio USA HM2016 HM2019 HM2022 HM2022 HM2022 Infant Mortality Total 8.3 8.7 6.9 6.9 5.7 Non -Hispanic White (NHW) 5.7 5.8 4.3 5.1 4.6 Non -Hispanic Black (NHB) 13.7 15.2 11.4 14.2 10.8 Racial disparity (NHB:NHW) 2.4 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.3 Asian/Other Pacific Islander - - 3.1 4.4 9.4 Hispanic - - 6.7 5.4 4.9 Rates per 1,000 live births . Infant Mortality While infant mortality has decreased since the last HealthMap , the rate remains above the national goal . Rates of infant mortality among Black infants remain significantly higher than other racial and ethnic groups. Maternal Health Lower rates of adolescent pregnancies occur at present compared to the previous HealthMap . Many maternal health outcomes and behavi ors have not improved , with higher percentages of pregnant mothers diagnosed with diabetes, engaging in substance use while pregnant, and without health insurance. Maternal and Infant Health, continued 86 As additional context, research by Celebrate One ( a community -wide, collaborative initiative created to reduce the Franklin County infant mortality rate while also cutting in half the racial disparity with this issue ) found that the infant mortality rates for both non -Hispanic White infants and non -Hispanic Black infants are substantially higher in certain Franklin County zip codes .3 For example, while the overall infant mortality rate in Frankin County was 6.9 in 2019, it was 50% greater (10.5) in the 13 zip codes shown in the figure below . Those zip codes correspond to Celebrate One's priority areas and tend to be those that historically have experienced high levels of poverty and low levels of outside investment. Franklin County's Priority Areas for Infant Mortality Prevention Efforts3 Franklin County: 6.91 Target: 5.02 Infant mortality rate Maternal and Infant Health, continued 87 Community Voices on Infant Health Community members are concerned about infant mortality, and especially those causes that are avoidabl e - due to parental behaviors and lack of resources or health care. \"Our infant mortality is through the roof. Like worse in the state of Ohio, worse than some third world countries. \" \"Not making it to their first birthday for whatever reason, and it's nine times eight times out of 10 it's not because they have a medical issue. \" \"I know some pe ople that are like I'm just gonna like take a little nap with my baby right next to me. Which, like you're not supposed to do at all, or all of these things have some of think are not a big deal. And then something really terrible happen that you're not ma king into their first birthday. \" \"If you don't have enough diapers for your baby that comes through, like if they have diarrhea that can turn into a yeast infection to an open skin wound.

Baby boys who are circumcised and don't get proper care of the area that can get infected and lead to terrible outcomes. \" \"Especially for African Americans. You just don't get the same attention and care. It's crazy to me that this is our reality. \" Black and African American community members said breastfeeding is not standard enough in their communities . Misconceptions may be present about the health value of bottle feeding compared to breastfeeding. \"Things like breastfeeding, you may not have had that experience, have friends or a family member or a sister [who breastfed their children]. As a young mother, that's di fficult . There are programs and there are ones in our community, but maybe there's not enough communication or outreach. \" \"I feel like, in my community, the doctors are pushing for people to bottle feed their babies. I knew better than to do that, but they pushed for that. And I don't know if they did it in another community ...\" Maternal and Infant Health, continued 88 In Franklin County , the rates of estimated pregnancies and live births among adolescents decreased for most age groups .

After childbirth , community members pointed to postpartum depression and lack of support for mothers as important health issues. The COVID -19 pandemic also contributed to a lower level of maternal support throughout pregnancy . Community members felt that substance use while pregnant is not taken seriously by some members of their community. \"A lot of your younger people, they do drugs. And of course, this is going to affect newborns. \" \"Pregnant woman not caring about chain smoking cigarettes even though I'm pregnant. And then the baby suffers because of that. \" \"Marijuana is a big one...I think the legalization of marijuana has made pregnant women feel a little more okay with smoking while they're pregnant. They'll smoke up into a certain month, and then they'll stop. \" \"Mental issues because of their parents are drinking alcohol. \" Pregnant mothers may also put off or have barriers to prenatal care . \"But during the COVID time, many of the pregnant mothers were not able to visit theirs doctors in timely fashions, and they didn't know the position of the baby sometimes. And the delivery had been very complicated, and they did not get the sufficient prenatal and even the postnatal care also.\" Maternal and Infant Health, continued 91 \"Lack of prenatal care. I'm noticing a lot of mothers are not going to the doctors right away. They're several months in before they'll even schedule their first doctor's appointment.\" \"There's not a lot of clinics anymore for reproductive health for women. That is something that we didn't talk about as far as a healthy community, having a women's health clinic or reproductive health clinic. That's important to have. I mean, I drive all the way up to Westerville for mine just be cause she gave me so much personalized attention that I will never go to another doctor. \" \"That was my first positive experience in a long time with a doctor going for reproductive health, and I don't think people are going to their prenatal appointments. \" Community members pointed out a few physical health issues they knew impacted maternal and infant health. \"People are not recognizing that Endometriosis is a huge issue right now. I know probably five women who have lost their babies recently. They were pregnant, and then they just lost them. So miscarriage is crazy right now in my community .\" \"Preeclampsia is like an epidemic, especially for Black women. \" Postpartum depression was regarded as a common issue in many Franklin County communities. \"There's been an increase, I think, in postpartum depression because they don't get as much help as maybe they would have. \" \"I feel like also a lot of people in the community that deal with postpartum depression without really being properly diagnosed with that, and it turns into mental health issues. And because of how you're perceived by your community, you don't want to address the issues and go and get help. That also can be an issue. \" \"And we can go down another whole other rabbit hole about Black wom en and pregnancy and postpartum how that's just not treated. \" \"I have a friend who's going through postpartum depression right now, and I have a niece that did the same thing when she was. And that's a rough thing to go through. It's hard on the child. It's hard on the mother. \" Community members also pointed out that some maternity leave practices do not provide mothers with adequate support post -birth. \"And related to maternal health, I mean, our s is a joke. As far as like the time you get off, you know, other countries are doing it right like giving them and their partner leave, like six months, or a year, or even three months. \" Maternal and Infant Health, continued 92 \"They only gave my husband a week off of work. And like one week is nothing, I wouldn't even barely be out of bed in a week. Like that doesn't help. On top of that we got two kids at home already. So it's like, I think it's the double standard that the men don't have to be there as much as the w oman. But really, we fall back on our husbands when we're down. \" COVID -19 increased maternal anxiety and stress during pregnancy, as mothers faced restrictions on bringing support persons to appointments and socializing. \"I mean anxiety. Especially throughout all of it just like being pregnant and having a baby, all within a pandemic. Maybe your partner doesn't come to an appointment with you because they're not allowed. You can't have any kind of support person. \" \"So it makes you feel alone in your pregnancy. Sometimes you're like, I got to go through all this by myself. And then the doctors only care so much. Yeah, they only see a little bit and you get in your head sometimes. So it's very hard, especially in a pandemic. \" \"Any ne ws that you get that's not good news, you're used to or want to have somebody with you. So that is anxiety inducing. Anybody knows stress and anxiety is terrible for someone who's pregnant. \" \"It's a little harder when you weren't able to have a baby shower or you weren't able to have the social supports to then bring your baby into the world and be mentally healthy afterwards. \" COVID -19 also made it more difficult for mothers to receive th e education and resources customarily provided during pregnan cy. \"So like childbirth, education, newborn classes, those have been canceled completely. Or you are doing your hospital tours online. And that's not why you signed up for a tour. You want to see it and like feel it right. You don't want to like see it on camera. So all of that plays into what that experience is going to be like, right? \" Maternal and Infant Health, continued 93 References 1 Ohio Department of Health, Public Health Data Warehouse (Franklin County and Ohio), 2019 (HM2022), (Franklin County), 2016 (HM2019); National Vital Statistics Report, 69(7) (United States), 2018 (HM2022); Ohio Department of Health, Infant Mortality Data (Ohio), 2016 (HM2019); National Kids Count Data Center (United States), 2015 (HM2019), 2011 (HM2016); Ohio Department of Health, Vital Statistics (Franklin County and Ohio), 2012 (HM2016) 2 Healthy People 2030 Objective MICH -02, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 3 Celebrate One , Data Dashboard January - March, 2021 4 Ohio Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics (Franklin County and Ohio), 201 8 (HM2022); Guttmacher Institute, Pregnancies, Births and Abortions in the United States, 1973 -2017: National and State Trends by Age (United States), 201 7 (HM2022); Ohio Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics Teen Pregnancy Report (Franklin County and Ohio) 2016 (HM2019); Ohio Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics Teen Pregnancy Report (Franklin County and Ohio) Teen Pregnancy Report 20 13 (HM2016) 5 Ohio Department of Health, Public Health Data Warehouse (Franklin County), 2019 (HM2022), 2016 (HM2019) , 2013 (HM2016) ; Hamilton BE, Rossen L, Lu L, Chong Y.

Key Findings Just under a quarter of Franklin County adult residents have been told they have a form of depression . The rate of suicide attempts leading to hospitalization has increased since the last HealthMap , as has the suicide rate.The rate of psychiatric admissions remains similar to that observed with the last HealthMap .

Community members point t o the amount of negativity people are exposed to in their communities and via media sources , lack of adequate emotional support for youth and adults , and the wide - ranging effects of the COVID -19 pandemic as contributors to poor mental health. Mental and Social Health, continued 96 Community Voices on Adult Mental Health Issues Community members were very concerned about the mental health issues of anxiety and depression . They spoke to the various contributors to poor mental health as well as what should be done to mitigate these issues and the barriers to doing so. Community members were most concerned with how anxiety and depression cause suicidal ideation and actions. \"The attempts or the thoughts [of suicide] is what is prevalent, not the actual action, but that's just as bad, if you ask me, to deal day to day w ith feelings like that. \" \"Anxiety is a killer also. Anxiety can drive you to suicide as easily as depression can.\" \"I guess I can only really speak to the age groups I interact closely with, millennials probably 25 to 40. And I personally have known seve ral people who have been victims of suicide and many more who have had those sorts of thoughts without expressing them very openly. \" \"People kill ing themselves and loved ones .\" As a cause of poor mental health, community members pointed to the amount of negativity people are exposed to , from tension and violence they see in their communities, to that which they see happening through social media. \"I think something that hasn't been said, but we get a little anxiety about the gun violence and j ust in general, how many people are dying from violence in the community. We live downtown, so it's going to happen, but even Chicago, like 54 people were shot this weekend. It's got me a little bit more worked up recently. Columbus is like the record year .\" . Franklin County: 13.53 Target: 12.85 Suicide rate Mental and Social Health, continued 97 \"Nearly every day I get a notification about [gun violence]. That just happened a while ago. I mean, it happens everywhere. It's just worrisome. That's just something I've been worried about community -wise.\" \"I just think a lot of stresses, a lot of people have that in neighborhoods because they're afraid to get out. And that isn't good for your health at all, when you're afraid to get out in your community.\" \"I would also say more exposure through social media or the news, just everything going on, whether it's COVID or all the things going around in the world, whether it's wildfires or unrest...I think that we just have a lot more exposure than we did prior to, say, the internet as far as what's going on. I think people can go down a spiral.\" \"Increase in hate.\" \"There has been a lot of racial tension. \" Support from other people encourages good mental health outcomes, and not having this support can contribute to poor mental health or make existing issues worse. \"Not having that support, I mean, I raised two sons. I'm grateful my sons are grown men now. But I can imagine having babies right now. I had so much support that I could take a mental health break by sending my kids to my friend's house, and then we would swap. I would k eep hers or send them to my mother, my parents' home. But people just don't have that now. It seems like, you know, either, you know, some people are not fit, or they're just not accessible or not willing. But it's like moms are like, mom and/or dads are j ust like out on their own now.\" \"Before COVID, I remember reading an article about aging and how when a person gets older, the less they experience the human touch. People don't touch them much. People avoid them.\" \"I was active duty military, so I've se en a ton of people that had mental health issues, and they wouldn't go seek attention, and it could just turn out for the worse.\" Community members also spoke about how negative valuations of self -worth impact poor mental health outcomes. \"As a society, we struggle with knowing self -worth and self -value...Everybody struggles with that because we have media telling us this is what you need to be, this is what you need to look like, this is the way you need to dress, this is the neighborhood you ne ed to live in, this is how much you need to make, et cetera.\" Mental and Social Health, continued 98 \"I know one person that committed suicide in the community ...a lot of times it's right in the home. The family may cause someone to want to commit suicide. I know the guy that killed himself, it was because his family, his wife, cheated on him. He found out and he just couldn't take it ...\" Community members noted how COVID -19 contributed to poor mental health outcomes by hindering typical modes of receiving social support . \"I think a lot in the past year, we haven't been able to socialize as much, and some people do need that social outlet. So it's harder to make meaningful connections and talk about things you're go ing through because you're at home by yourself. \" \"And you've got this combination of people staying home, already disconnected maybe from their in -person workplace. They're also experiencing this extreme political divisiveness over the ongoing pandemic and everything. \" \"You can't even get your nieces, nephews, sons and daughters, grandchildren, you can't even get their affection, and so the void becomes bigger. \" \"When you talk physically, people were really separated, and we could not get to know each other and the celebration, the events, that we used to have, you know. Generally, we were totally isolated on that part. And you deal with people who started experiencing some kind of, you know, anxiety and depression. \" COVID -19 also made people feel powerless as they struggled to adjust to changes to their lives . \"I think we're trying to process all the changes that have come our way, quickly and often its difficult. Or, you know, just mentioned families earlier, whether regardless of your family structure, you've had to adjust your life in some way, shape, or form. \" \"People don't feel they have control anymore. Their control was taken away. Kind of like a powerless thing, because we were told we had to stay and we had to wear a mask. You have to do this, or you should. There's pressure about the vaccine. There's pressure now for the children. All kind of pressure. \" \"There were a lot of contributions in regard to job loss and loss of members of their family who they lost due to COVID or due to other things .\" \"And that's obviously something I think my generation at least have never experienced before. So to be able to be told absolutely no to traveling or doing anything really that you wanted to do prior was a pretty sober ing experience that this is the world we could live in... \" Mental and Social Health, continued 99 Community members pointed to the experiences of workers that suffered heightened pressure and stress during COVID -19 due to the nature of their positions. \"I think it definitely contributed to the mental health issues because I know that there were teachers that I was pulling out of dark places who just were very frustrated with the public learning platform that we were using. And so it was very challenging for them to try to grad e the students and have to try to prepare them for the testing, which they thought was ridiculous that they had to take. \" \"I think we talk about young people when it comes to suicide ...but a lot of people are dealing with a lot of issues to the point where they just want to end it. And we need special support for everyone, not just certain age groups. Parents are dealing with that. Teachers are dealing with that. Health care workers are dealing with that .\" \"A lot of people around me work in the servic e industry. And a lot of them are actually have been working through this whole thing... So that's a whole other level of anxiety that they are having to deal with that ...having to go through all the scary, scary information that was going on at the very begi nning and not knowing just how communicable it was ...There's a couple of nurses that live in my building that it impacted them pretty severely .\" Community members also commented how financial concerns during the COVID -19 pandemic increased feelings of stress and anxiety. YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH Because the number of youth suicides (e.g., among those age 15 -24) was so low in recent years , a rate cannot be calculated for this. This in itself suggest s an improvement in this indicator from the last HealthMap (12.8 per 100,000 of the population) .6 Community Voices on Youth Mental Health Issues Concerns about youth suicide and suicidal ideation were common among community members. \"I'm an educator, and I had a lot of students who had come to my office and who would talk to me about having suicidal thoughts and struggling with suicide a lot this past year and talking about how their parents were unable to help them. \" \"I have a 17 -year -old in high school who lost two people in his school to suicide within the last two years that he knows. That's something that they wanted to resort to. That's something that they talk about as an option to deal with their teenager concerns .\" \"I think having more available health resources in school...But that would be really helpful because those people are trained to recognize those signs. Kids Mental and Social Health, continued 100 are at school for eight hours a day, and there might be that time when somebody catches somebody and could save a kid's life. A lot of the social media and the lack of activities contributes to depression and anxiety, and kids don't know what really that is or how to deal with it, but if they can get help early enough, it could possibly prevent them f rom having suicidal thoughts or attempting suicide .\" \"I think our young people are going through so much pressure to be perfect, to be the best, to be famous, to be the breadwinner sometimes. And so I do think that our young in Reynoldsburg actually are f acing issues with suicide, suicidal attempts, and mental health issues that have suicide ideations. Over the summer, I did get a couple of emails from the school district saying that we lost a couple of kids over the summer. \" While adult residents mentioned pressure to be perfect, social media, and bullying as contributors to poor mental health for youth , these conversations lacked more specific insight from youth about contributors to suicidal ideation. Community members were also concerned with youth \"raising themselves\" due to parents unwilling or unable to consistently care for them. \"Got a lot of young parents today, so these kids is raising themselves a lot of times. Parents out there partying, on Facebook, and doing lives. And kids is doing whatever they want to do. Then they want to blame them when the teacher call saying such and such is having issues in school. You got to look at the parent. \" \"The parents aren't taking care of them. They're not having somebody check on them or stay with them while they're out partying. So like he said before, they're raising themselves. \" \"Yeah, a lot of kids are having to grow too fast. Again, become the support system for their siblings and it's hard because t he parents are going back to work now. did a lot of stuff is still not opening. So it was like a 13 year old has to become a 20 year old overnight to take care of the family while the parents are out doing what they have to do. \" \"And then also like someth ing affecting kids 18 and younger is just like, like they're home alone, you know, like so their parents can't be home. They can't afford latchkey. You know, the 13-year -old walks with a six-year -old home and they just fend for themselves. And there's not necessarily anything wrong with it. But that social emotional component is important too, which leads into all kinds of issues. \" Along with concern about parents being present to provide physical and emotional support for their children, community members also mentioned parental stress contributing to poor parenting , and children modeling negative behaviors of their parents when it comes to substance use. Mental and Social Health, continued 101 COVID -19 affected mental health for youth in similar ways as adults, in isolating them from social circles while they faced numerous changes to their daily lives. However , youth may face additional difficulty understanding their emotions and how to articulate them or seek help during this time. \"Maybe for kids, too. They were stuck. They were just sitting playing video games, and then they have to adjust going back to school. Some schools are hybrid. Some schools are still remote. So it's stress, a nd people trying to adapt to things changing faster than they can adapt to.\" \"School was an outlet for lots of things for children for activity, socialization, and then more. With the pandemic, obviously, with people having to be at home, a lot of that wa s lost...So, I think it's just added a lot of different stressors for not only the parent but for the child too, because they didn't have that structure...that affects, you know, your children's health as it relates to physical and their mental health. We, a s adults, who are struggling with change, think about the kids, and how they don't even have the skills to deal with the change.\" \"Having those honest conversations with your children, even with young children, how they're feeling around COVID ... All my ch ildren are under five, and... they want to know, 'Why can't we go here? Why can't we go there? Why do we have to video chat with grandma and grandpa ?' That does affect them.\" \"I feel like with COVID especially, I think a lot of children are depressed, but they don't know what it is. They don't know how to convey how they're feeling.\" HOUSEHOLD AND COMMUNITY VIOLENCE In Franklin County, the number of child abuse cases is similar to the last HealthMap .

High blood pressure and high blood cholesterol remain the most common chronic disease diagnoses, with around one -third of adults affected. Emergency Department and Hospitalization Data The highest rate of emergency department visits, by a large margin, occur due to mental health issues. Over 50% of hospitalizations due to injury are because of falls, the rates of which have increased for adults age 65 and over since the previous HealthMap. Mortality Heart diseases and cancer are the leading causes of death for both males and females. The leading cause of youth mortality is unable to be determined, though overall rates of youth mortality have decreased since the previous HealthMap . Death, Illness, and Injury, continued 105 Regarding Franklin County residents' overall health , nearly one-fifth (19.2 %) consider their health to be \"fair\" or \"poor. \" Perceptions o f Health Status1 Franklin County Ohio USA HM20 22 HM2016 HM2019 HM2022 HM2022 Health 18.2% MORTALITY In 2018, the average life expectancy for people born in Franklin County was 77.13 years. By comparison, the average life expectancy for those born in Ohio in 2018 was 76.8 years . However, in the first half of 2020, Americans' life expectancy at birth decreased by a year, one of the largest observed decline s since World War II .1 Per the National Center for Health Statistics: \"Provisional life expectancy at birth in the first half of 2020 was the lowest level since 2006 for both the total population (77.8 years) and for males (75.1), and was the lowest level since 2007 for females (80.5 ).\" 2 Moreover, these worsening life expectancy estimates were not experienced equitably across racial and ethnic groups. From 2019 through 2020, the life expectancy estimates for non- Hispanic Black males, non -Hispanic Black females, and Hispanic males each decreased by more than 2 years of life , compared to a decrease of less than a year for White males or White females . \"Life expectancy for the non -Hispanic Black population, 72.0, declined the most, and was the lowest estimate seen since 2001 (for the Black population regardless of Hispanic origin). The Hispanic population experienced the second largest decline in life expectancy (79.9) reaching a level lower than what it was in 2006, the first year for which... estimates by Hispanic origin were produced (80.3) \" 2 This dramatic and in equitable decrease in life expectancy was caused, at least partially, by the COVID -19 pandemic.

Death, Illness, and Injury, continued 111 Community Voices on Chronic Health Conditions Specific chronic health conditions Franklin County residents see in their communities include diabetes , high blood pressure/hypertension, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD ). A common theme in community discussions was poor mobility and chronic health conditions associated with this, including obesity and disability. Community members see poor mental health, access to nutrition, access to health car e, and economic inequalities as contribut ing to these and other chronic health conditions. Chronic health conditions linked to loss of mobility were important to community members . Mobility was important for how it impact s physical activit y and the ability to get out in the community for basic needs and socialization . \"I'm seeing a lot of people who are struggling with weight gain or been struggling with mobility problems. \" \"I would say obesity would be a big one. We live in an area where there are a lot of kids. And so it definitely looks, the landscape definitely looks a little bit different than when I was younger, so to speak. And there are 1,000,001 reasons for that.\" \"I wo uld say that there's very little activity. I feel like when we see more people in our bikes or walking around in the neighborhood, that's a good sign it's a healthy community. People are out and about, but a lot of us aren't even getting out, being social being active.\" \"I think mobility is our biggest thing. I don't see a lot of people being able to get out and about.\" \"Immobility, people with canes, and people in motorized wheelchairs that go up and down the street, people in regular wheelchairs or canes, things like that.\" \"Not enough handicap parking, And the sidewalks, they have to ride their mobile wheelchairs in the street or else they will hurt themselves on these sidewalks. A lot of the people in my community are on those in the street where people are speeding by.\" \"I think about one lady that she's older, and she's struggling now with arthritis and not being able to work. And she's still caring for her disabled, adult son. It's sad because I see her. It's hard.\" Community members linked stress and poor mental health to chronic health issues. \"Not taking care of yourself. \" Death, Illness, and Injury, continued 112 \"You don't have time to destress. Like, take a break. So I think that also gives you a lot of like blood pressure, or migraines. You don't have time to just to sit and breathe, or make good meals. \" \"I read a few years ago, they did a study, and it said people that open up the newspaper to the main section or whatever first, they usually live a shorter life opposed to people that go to the sports and look at that first. Because I mean, it just puts you on edge. You're stressed out from reading all this negative stuff. \" \"I think a lot of people, fear ...Once they get kind of trapped in there and they're either by themselves and they're alon e, they just keep feeding into that fear...We're talking about mobility. Fear is definitely one that keeps people from moving about. \" Community members are aware of the impact of nutrition on chronic disease , and pointed out what they see barring adequate nutrition in their communities. \"It's how people eat, and I guess the food resources that are available in certain communities might not be available in other communities. Me personally, I think it's strategically planned o ut like that, but nutrition is a big one. \" \"They're struggling with, again, making the healthy decisions as far as food is concerned. I've had a lot of people telling me about, their cholesterol is up, their A1C is up, all the things that come with not having a healthy lifestyle. \" \"But I guess the thing that keeps coming to my mind is this singular thing of what we're trying to fight: alcohol, sugary foods, soda, yada, yada, yada. Those are all the biggest spons ors for everything we see and everyone sees day to day, billboards of Coke. Everything sponsored by Coke. \" \"Yeah, time to shop for and then make and pay for high quality ingredients. \" \"And there are people who don't have transportation, so I see them reg ularly shopping at Family Dollar because it's easily accessible , versus having to walk on a busy Main Street with no sidewalk to get to Kroger's. So, there's no sidewalk for parts of that journey. It is dangerous. I probably would go to Family Dollar too i f I didn't have a car. \" Community members spoke to the numerous barriers that keep people from accessing health care : cost, proximity, ease of scheduling, and the ability to prioritize health. \"Just access to community health programs or healthcare. Even as somebody with insurance, I still have difficulty finding access to care for different specialties or mental health things , just on the affordability side. Oftentimes, it's not covering enough to make it feasible for me at the time .\" \"Do they have doctors in your area? Or, you know, doctors' offices that they would feel comfortable going to and is there insurance there. \" Death, Illness, and Injury, continued 113 \"I feel like it's just healthcare system, a lot of like red tape barriers because my family don't have insurance. My h usband, he tried to seek his psychiatrist because he's been depressed lately. Well, the office said, 'Okay, we take walk -in appointments through this time .' And then he came in for the walk -in appointment, and they said, 'I'm sorry. You haven't been here i n six months. You'll have to make an appointment .' So then he tried calling his psychiatrist, and his psychiatrist said, 'No, I'm sorry, I can't make you an appointment. I can't make my own appointments. You'll have to talk to my secretary .' So he's going to have to wait two weeks to talk to someone when he's depressed. \" \"It's also if something hurts or like you're having like, just push through it it'll be fine, you don't have time for it, you're just going, going, going, because you think 'I will deal with it later .' [Inaudible]. And you can just ignore it and put it off.\" Community members also pointed t o economic inequalit y, which contributes to health conditions by precluding access to wealth, nutrition, and basic needs. \"And bad health is usually based upon lack of livable wages, employment opportunities, discrimination, and the hostile work environment. These things happen. Everybody can't deal with them. And it happens so disproportionately to Black and brown people.\" \"Economics. Greed. Right now, in the United States of America, we have the technology to house, feed, clothe, and get everybody medical attention, but greed is still here. It's a big thing. It's spawned legs and wants more and don't want to give anybody el se anything. So it's going to be here for a while, but we do have the technology in existence right now. Well, if everything in society was like utopia, we could grow food. We could give everybody the right nutritional foods, a sustainable place to live, a sustainable system to where everybody is generally taken care of and live harmonious...and your health is going to be better, but like I said, greed.\" Death, Illness, and Injury, continued 114 REASONS FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION Another way to identify high prevalen ce health issues that cause Franklin County residents to feel ill is to analyz e data related to emergency department utilization for the four major health systems in central Ohio. A selected list of health issues, based on community interest in this topic, is shown below , along with the rate that each of those issues are associated with emergency department utilization in Franklin County. Note the high rate of emergency department utilization due to mental health issues at both the county and state levels.

In 2020 , 9,426 injured patients were admitted to the hospital or transferred in or out of the emergency department for further evaluation in Franklin County. The table below lists the most frequently ob served categories of injury causes. For example, among the 9,426 patients who were hospitalized for injury in 2020 , 55% had experienced a fall whereas 15.2 % were involved in a motor vehicle crash. Top 5 Types of Injury That Lead to Hospitalization16 Franklin County HM2016 HM2019 - 4.2% 3.0% Only the top 5 mechanisms of injury that lead to hospitalization are shown; percentages for each year will not sum to 100 The next table analyzes these top five types of trauma events by the age of the patient. Those who are age 65 and older are more likely than other age groups to experience a fall that requires a hospital visit; the rate of injuries -due-to-falls for this age group has increased from the last HealthMap . Young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 often visited hospitals due to injuries sustained from motor vehicle (traffic1) injuries, motor vehicle ( non-traffic ) injuries, and firearms ; their rates for these types of injuries are higher than any other age group. 1 A motor vehicle traffic accident is any motor vehicle accident occurring on a public highway (i.e., originating, terminating, or involving a vehicle on the highway).

Solove Research Institute I Health Needs Assessment 2022 20 IMPACT OF 2019 CHNA Impact of Actions to Address Priority Needs in 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment HealthMap2019 Priorities The Franklin County Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee identified three priority areas: mental health and addiction, income/poverty and maternal and infant health. 1. Mental Health and Addiction: 22% of Franklin County residents have been diagnosed with depression. Mental health needs account for a significant number of emergency department admissions. Deaths from drug overdoses, especially from opiates, are increasing at alarming rates. In 2017, there were 520 overdose deaths in Franklin County, a 47% increase from the previous year. Key Indicators Mental health Hire additional providers Improve access to care Addiction Narcan administrations Efforts by the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center to address these indicators include: Partnering with the other health systems, public health, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and community organizations to address addiction through the work of the Columbus and Franklin County Addiction Plan. Use of a standardized, evidence-based tool for depression screening for adults with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, referral if clinically necessary, effective treatment and appropriate follow-up. Providing Ohio State STAR (Stress, Trauma And Resilience) services for first responders through its collaboration with ADAMH (Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health Board of Franklin County) to provide peer support group sessions and create an app for first responders that will assess mental health and provide tools.The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute I Health Needs Assessment 2022 21 Increased naloxone education and distribution by integrating naloxone distribution models further within emergency departments and hospitals, addiction services and other treatment settings. Partnering with Columbus Division of Fire's RREACT (Rapid Response Emergency Addiction Crisis Team) program to increase the number of on-campus and community sites that can distribute naloxone, fentanyl test strips, drug disposal bags and education on harm reduction and treatment resources. Enhanced Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) access by increasing the number of physicians, physician assistants and advanced practice nurses who have obtained a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine (DATA 2000 waiver) and by providing technical assistance and support to providers (both internally and externally throughout the community) who have a release to prescribe MOUD. Supporting the Substance Abuse Treatment, Education and Prevention Program (STEPP) Clinic as it provides addiction and mental health services and weekly education sessions to promote a healthy pregnancy and postpartum period for its moms with the goal of having healthy, full-term babies. Partnering with Southeast Healthcare's RREACT team to transfer patients presenting in the emergency department to treatment facilities including Maryhaven Addiction Stabilization Center and Talbot Hall. Expanding opioid-sparing protocols like Toward Opioid-Free Ambulatory Surgery (TOFAS) and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) that reduce the number of opiate prescriptions dispensed to patients, specifically for patients undergoing outpatient gastrointestinal surgeries, cesarean deliveries and total hip and knee replacements. Hospitals have reduced the amount of opiates prescribed to patients undergoing GI surgeries by 52% since 2017. Hospitals have reduced the amount of opiates prescribed to women undergoing cesarean birth by 22% since 2019. Expanded use of telehealth options due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Continuing to offer a full complement of behavioral health services through telehealth. Increased understanding of how self-stigma can negatively impact treatment through validation of the Brief Opioid Stigma Scale (BOSS) in a racially, ethnically and clinically diverse sample. Expanded use of patient-reported outcomes in clinical decision making throughout a variety of programs and across the continuum of behavioral health care. Growing outpatient operations from one clinic at Harding Hospital to four clinics, ensuring a behavioral health presence wherever ambulatory is expanding.The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute I Health Needs Assessment 2022 22 2. Income/Poverty: Franklin County's poverty rate stood at 15.9% in 2017, higher than the state's rate of 14% and the nation's rate of 12.3%. The poverty rate among Black residents was 27.3%; 10.8% of white Franklin County residents lived in poverty in 2017. Struggling to pay for housing and food are determinants of health linked to a number of health issues. The number of households spending a significant percentage (at least 30%) of household income on housing has steadily increased over time in Franklin County. Key Indicators Housing Food Access to health care Efforts by the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center to address these indicators include: Creating the Mid-Ohio Farmacy program, which combines The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center's Family and Community Medicine Department's medical services with the Mid-Ohio Food Collective's food services. This program began in primary care and maternal fetal medicine and has expanded to include endocrinology, ophthalmology, the AIDS Education and Training Center and Talbot Hall.

Opening Outpatient Care New Albany and the opening of Outpatient Care Dublin in 2022 to expand access to care to residents of Franklin County. Expanding telehealth options during the COVID-19 pandemic, which are now maintained and creating greater health equity for our patients. The Wexner Medical Center went from 50 telehealth visits a month before the pandemic to about 3,000 per day during 2020. We still average more than 1,000 virtual visits daily. Social determinants, behavioral determinants and environmental determinants of health are key drivers for sustaining our telehealth options. Launching the Community Care Coach, a mobile unit that is managed through a partnership between the Family and Community Medicine and the Obstetrics and Gynecology departments. This unit was first utilized to help bring COVID-19 testing to central Ohio residents. It now sees clients of Moms2B, a prevention program for expectant moms at high risk for infant mortality, and patients throughout the community. Improving flu vaccination uptake in non-white populations through targeted communications and onsite community clinics and by offering them in clinical spaces and emergency departments.

Screening patients for the social determinants of health and increasing care coordination to find assistance for these needs. 3. Maternal and Infant Health: Overall health of pregnant women before delivery. Prevention of preterm births. While infant mortality wasn' t selected here as a priority health need, it's closely related to prenatal health and preterm births. Key Health Needs Mother's health before pregnancy/pre-conception Prevention of preterm births Address infant mortalityThe Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute I Health Needs Assessment 2022 24Efforts by the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center to address these indicators include: Supporting the work of Moms2B, a prevention program for expectant moms at high risk for infant mortality, through virtual and in-person education sessions, baby and mom well-checks and support for wrap-around services from patient navigators.

Launched Mom-Baby Dyad Care under the Ohio Department of Health's Mom- Baby bundle with a focus on caring for moms with gestational diabetes during babies' well-child care visits. There were no comments on the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center's 2019 CHNA.About Franklin County HealthMap2022 1 The Franklin County Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee is pleased to provide residents of central Ohio with a comprehensive overview of our community's health status and needs via Franklin County HealthMap20 22. Franklin County HealthMap20 22 is the result of a broad collaborative effort coordinated by the Central Ohio Hospital Council (COHC), Columbus Public Health (CPH), and Franklin County Public Health (FCPH). The intent of this effort is to help health departments, hospitals , social service agencies, other organizations , and community stakeholders better understand the health needs and priorities of Franklin County residents. As part of its mission, COHC serves as the forum for community hospitals to collaborate with each other and with other community stakeholders to improve the quality, value, and accessibility of health care in the central Ohio region. Although COHC's member hospitals have service areas that extend across central Ohio, for the purposes of this report, the local geographic focus area is Franklin County. CPH serves the residents of the City of Columbus and the City of Worthington, and FCPH serves the residents of all other cities, towns, and villages in Franklin County. Characterizing and u nderstanding the prevalence of acute and chronic health conditions, access to care barriers, and other health issues can help direct community resources to where they will have the biggest impact. To that end, central Ohio's hospitals and health departments will begin using the data reported in Franklin County HealthMap20 22, in collaboration with other organizations, to inform the develop ment and implement ation of strategic plans to meet the community 's health needs. Consistent with federal requirements, Franklin County HealthMap20 22 will be updated in three years . The Fra nklin County Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee hope s Franklin County HealthMap20 22 serves as a guide to target and prioritize limited resources, a vehicle for strengthening community relationships, and a source of information that contri butes to keeping people healthy. Franklin County HealthMap20 22's Process The process for Franklin County HealthMap2022 reflected an adapted version of Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's County Health Rankings and Roadmaps: Assess Needs and Resources process.1 This process is designed to help stakeholders \"understand current community strengths, resources, needs, and gaps,\" so they can better focus their efforts and collaboration. 1 See https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/take -action -to-improve -health/action -center/assess -needs -resources About Franklin County HealthMap2022, continued 2 The primary phases of the Assess Needs and Resources process, as adapted for use in Franklin County HealthMap2022 , included the following steps. (1) Prepare to Assess. Members of the c ommunity were closely involved throughout with the design and implementation of Franklin County HealthMap2022 . On October 29, 2020 , members of the Franklin County HealthMap2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee1 gathered via Zoom to learn about the upcoming community health needs assessment process and how their experience and involvement would be critical for the s uccess of the effort. On November 20, 2020, the Steering Committee members received an email inviting them to participate in a brief community visioning survey. The purpose of this survey was to gather input on what a healthier Franklin County looks like as well as to help identify potential health indicators for inclusion in Franklin County HealthMap2022 . The 26 Steering Committee members who responded to the survey provided their feedback regarding : What would a healthy Franklin County look like to you? Given your vision for a healthy Franklin County, what do you think are the biggest barriers or issues that are keeping the County from getting there? Overall, what are the five most important issues or topics that should be considered in our upcoming community health assessment work? On January 25, 2021, the Steering Committee gathered again via Zoom to discuss their perspectives on emerging health issues in Franklin County, to participate in conversation with one another about the current state of health in the county and the results of the community visioning survey , and to identify potential health indicators for inclusion in Franklin County HealthMap2022 . Both small group discussions and large group \"report -outs\" occurred during this session. The Franklin County HealthMap2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Executive Committee then used the information from these preceding working meetings and community visioning survey to identify which indicators could be assessed via secondary sources and wh ich indicators could be gathered via primary data collection efforts. (2) Collect and Analyze Secondary Data. Quantitative secondary data for health indicators came from national sources (e.g., U.S. Census, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System), state sources (e.g., Ohio Department of Health's Data Warehouse, Ohio Hospital Association, Ohio Medicaid Assessment Surv ey), and local sources (e.g., Central Ohio Trauma System). Rates and/or percentages were calculated when necessary. In some instances, comparable state and/or national data were unavailable at the 1 These individuals are listed on page 6 of this report. About Franklin County HealthMap2022, continued 3 time of report preparation and, accordingly, are not includ ed in this report. All data sources are identified in a reference list following each section of the report. In some cases, new secondary data indicators were identified that were not included in the previous report ( HealthMap2019 ). For example, new indic ators include days of pollution or excessive heat, Opportunity Index scores, and the ratio of residents to psychiatrists. I n these instances, the most recent secondary data available are listed under the HealthMap2022 heading, and previous data are listed under the HealthMap2019 heading, even though these new data will not be found in the HealthMap2019 report . This was done for ease of reading. Indicators identified by the Steering Committee for inclusion in the Franklin County HealthMap2022 were then collected and entered into a database for review and analysis. To ensure community stakeholders can use this report to make well -informed decisio ns, only the most recent data available at the time of report preparation are presented. To be considered for inclusion in Franklin County HealthMap2022 , quantitative secondary data must have been collected or published in 2016 or later. (3) Collect and Analyze Primary Data. Qualitative primary data for health indicators were obtained from a series of nine 90-minute focus groups held from July 28, 202 1 through August 19, 2021 . These discussion sessions were held in convenient, trusted locations in the community (e.g., Columbus Metropolitan Library branches; township buildings; Columbus Public Health's administrative headquarters) and were facilitated by professional researcher s. A combination of grassroots/volunteer and professional/paid recruiting efforts were used to identify a diverse mix of Franklin County residents to participate in these sessions. Focus group participants received a financial incentive to attend these sessio ns and to share their opinions and experiences with the research team. Overall, 76 Franklin County adults who reside within the primary jurisdictions of the COHC - member hospitals (as defined for this process) , CPH, and FCPH participated in these focus groups, sharing their thoughts and observations about a wide range of health topics. These discussions included a focus on underlying factors that contribute to health issues, such as poverty and racism. Transcripts from these discussions can be found in the appendix. (4) Identify Priorit y Heath Needs. On October 13, 2021 , the Steering Committee received a draft copy of Franklin County HealthMap20 22, along with a request to suggest comment s on and edits to the report. On October 20 , 2021, the Steering Committee met via Zoom to review Franklin County HealthMap2022 and to identify potential priority health issues . The meeting participants were divided into small groups, with each group asked to review a specific section of Franklin About Franklin County HealthMap2022, continued 4 County HealthMap2022 and, within that section, to identify potential priority health issues for consideration by the larger group. In addition to sharing their personal experience and history during these small -group conversations , meeting participants were asked to consider the following criteria when prioritizing these health issues : Equity: Degree to which specific groups are disproportionally affected b y an issue. Size: Number of persons affected, taking into account variance from benchmark data and targets. Seriousness: Degree to which the health issue leads to death, disability, and impairs one's quality of life. Feasibility: Ability of organization or individuals to reasonably combat the health issue given available resources. Related to the amount of control and knowledge (influence) organization(s) have on the issue. Severity of the Consequences of Inaction: Risks associate d with exacerbation of the health issue if not addressed at the earliest opportunity. Trends: Whether or not the health issue is getting better or worse in the community over time. Intervention: Any existing multi -level public health strategies proven to b e effective in addressing the health issue. Value: The importance of the health issue to the community. Social Determinant / Root Cause: Whether or not the health issue is a root cause or social determinant of health that impacts one or more health issues. The meeting on October 20, 2021 led to the identification of 28 potential priority health issues that affect Franklin County residents. On November 8, 2021, the Steering Committee members received an invitation to participate in an online survey that would lead to the identification of the final set of priority health needs for the community. This prioritization survey was structured as follows. First, it provided an orientation to the purpose and in tent of the effort. It presented an array of criteria that respondents should use when identifying priority health needs (e.g., the list of nine factors presented above ). Each participant in this prioritization process was asked to consider the role played by social determinants of health and health inequities. The survey questionnaire then instructed respondents to review the list of 28 potential priority health issues and select a maximum of five (5) most important health issues affecting Franklin Count y residents. Overall, 29 Steering Committee members completed this survey. After tabulating the responses, there was clear consensus about the community's priority health needs : these are displayed on page 19 . From these exercises, the Steering Committee was able to complete its charge to identify the prioritized health needs of Franklin County. About Franklin County HealthMap2022, continued 5 (5) Identify Community Assets and Resources. In December 2021, the Executive Committee identif ied community assets and resources that could potentially address the prioritized health needs , including existing healthcare facilities, community organizations , and programs or other resources. Inclusion of these potential partners and resources in the Franklin County Health Map2022 is consistent with hospital requirements for conducting a needs assessment. (6) Share Results with the Community . In December 20 21, COHC conducted a review of Franklin County HealthMap 2022 to ensure that it was compliant with Internal Revenue Service regulations for conducting community health needs assessments. CPH and FCPH also conducted internal reviews to ensure the report satisfied the requirements set forth by the Public Health Accred itation Board (PHAB). No information gaps that may impact the ability to assess the health needs of the community were identified while conducting the 2022 health needs assessment for Franklin County. This report will be posted on COHC's, CPH's, and FCPH's websites , will be used in subsequent c ommunity prioritization and planning efforts, and will be widely distributed to organizations that serve and represent residents in the county. How To Read This Report Franklin County HealthMap 2022 is organized into multiple, distinct sections. Each section begins with a sentence that briefly describes the section and is then followed by \"call -out boxes\" that highlight and summarize the key findings of the data compilation and analysis, from the researchers' perspective s. For some indicators, the re lated U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 20 30 goals are included with Franklin County's status indicated by a icon if the goal is met and an icon if the goal hasn't been met. Each section includes several tables, designed to allow the reader to easily compare the most recent Franklin County data to historical Franklin County data, as well as state and national data. Most tables include the column headers Franklin County, Ohio, and the United States. Within the Franklin County header , there are three columns, labeled HM201 6, HM201 9, and HM2022 . HM 2022 references most recent data presented in HealthMap 2022 . HM201 9 references HealthMap201 9 or relevant historical data, and HM201 6 references HealthMap201 6 or relevant historical data . Throughout this report, a hyphen ( - ) is used within tables when data were not presented previously or are not accessible . As noted above, the re is a three -year interval between each version of Franklin County HealthMap . Whenever possible, 1 -year or 3 -year data estimates are reported in this About Franklin County HealthMap2022, continued 6 document; however, sometimes only 5-year data estimates were available. Comparisons of 5 - year data estimates among different HealthMap versions should be done with caution. In each table, the HM 2022 column also includes an upward -facing triangle () if the HM2022 statistic is greater than the one reported in HM201 9 by 10% or more . A downward -facing triangle () indicates the HM2022 statistic is less than the one reported in HM2019 by 10% or more . Use caution when interpreting indicators with small values , which only need relatively small changes to produce a 10% difference.

Community Voices on M aking a Healthy Community Communication and social connection between residents were widely recognized across community discussions as a feature of a healthy community . Additionally, c ommunity members mentioned safety in various dimensions. Access to healthcare services, as well as access to healthy foods and recreat ion were mentioned in multiple community discussions about what makes a community healthy. Less frequently mentioned features of a healthy community appear in bullet points at the end of this section. Communication and relationship building between members of the community support good mental health and feelings of safety . In discussions around relationship building and communication, community members mentioned the value of community activities to help people get to know one another, as well as the importance of communication specifically around local governance issues, not only between resident s in local community meetings , but between residents and their local government officials. \"Communication, like when you talk to people around you, you get a feeling for people and what they might need and what they're go ing through. You can share your experiences, I just think it's healthier when you talk to people around you, getting to know them better. \" \"I think the relationships - Kind of tying into what you were saying is building relationships in the community, too .\" \"I think a community that looks after each other, has good relations, is caring...And realizing that different is not bad, because we are all different, but we are all human. So the most important thing is to be caring. \" \"A friendly community, friendl y people will not develop anxiety, they will not develop depression, because of issues in the society. As long as we help each other care for each other. This will be a healthy society. \" \"Being able to talk to your neighbor, knowing that he's going to be out there checking out for your children if something happens, and just watching the neighborhood and making sure everyone is safe.\" \"If I see somebody at someone's door, I could say I can keep an eye out for him or something's happening. I can support t hem more and then they know what [I have to offer] and I know what [they have to offer].\" \"What she said about the old school feel, you know, knowing that you can trust the folks in your neighborhood to support or look out for each other.\" Vision of a Health y Franklin County , continued 12 Feeling s afe from crime is a feature of and a prerequisite to a healthy community , in how it benefits mental health and supports physically active lifestyles. Environmental safety , like the mitigation of air and water pollutant s, pests, and uncollected trash are another important aspect of safety . \"It would also include traffic and mitigation of traffic, a lot of cars and fumes and exhaust. That's something t hat doesn't necessarily lend itself to a healthy environment if there is a lot of traffic near the places where you live or congregate.\" \"[Not] having industrial parks close by or train stations and things of that nature that pass off a lot of fumes that could impact kids, or powerline grids that might have other kinds of things like radiation that might have a history of causing things tha t are cancerous. The presence of those things do es impact the health of the community.\" \"The City of Columbus is doing all these initiatives to try to reduce emissions, and they didn't meet their 2020 deadline, but they have a new one for 2050. And they'r e introducing things like thirsty gardens to help with rainwater that pools in places that's unhealthy for children because it gets into our waterways, [more of] those types of types of incentives and things that are going on.\" \"Your shelter has to be such that it's healthy, mitigation of lead paint, safe drinking water. So no lead in your water or no other contaminants or whatever. \" \"Just feeling safe, knowing that it's safe, feeling secure in your environment. Safety is primarily it. I mean, if you feel safe, then you feel free. You can pretty much go after your dreams .\" \"You are not all stressed and there is a lot of safe places. A lot of stress creeps up a lot of anxieties and makes you worry about certain things which you have to keep outside, and you don't have to bring them in and you worried about where they are going to be in the morning and stuff like that. Any noise at night you sort of worry somebody is breaking in and so on. \" \"Then stress levels as well. Like what's going on in the neighborhood, that kind of plays very big into the mental health aspect. Is it a loud area? Is there are a lot of a lot of stuff going on as far as trouble and whatever else, you know? Is it easy to sleep at night? \" \"I think a healthy community protects its children, whether that means making sure the schools are safe , or just the streets themselves , the neighborhood, the playgrounds are places where kids can play freely and feel safe. \" \"I would say safety, we feel safe enough to walk and be outside or safe enough to let our kids be outside ...\" Vision of a Health y Franklin County , continued 13 \"Landlords that are responsible when it comes to pest control, bed bugs. I don't have the money to do it myself, and we don't have a landlord who helps take care of it in that way. It ruins people's lives.\" \"So cleanliness, not just for myself, but for the neighbors in the way that it's managed by the city and trash pickup and all that stuff...Is it a physically clean neig hborhood?\" Other factors of environmental safety mentioned by residents included infrastructure like sidewalks and streetlights to ensure people feel safe to walk around their community without danger from cars and traffic. Additionally, healthy communities overcome barriers to general and behavioral health care access , like lack of transportation, financial, or language supports . \"It has access to healthcare when necessary that's not too challenging to reach and get to .\" \"When I think of health, I think of hospitals, like a nearby hospital. \" \"Supportive services. Just a general healthcare center. \" \"Access to healthcare, close facilities. \" \"Accessible health care costs. \" \"Not being afraid to go to the hospital just because you know that you're not going to be able to pay the bill. \" \"Free clinics. \" \"Mental health coverage is important. \" \"Drug counseling. \" \"Well, mental health is a part of being healthy too, so having those types of resources in the communities is also important, especially in our schools, where kids are dealing with a lot of things that they might not feel comfortable talking about at home. \" \"I also think language and culture are a big disadvantage, because a lot of people don't speak the same language . There's a barrier there, communicating and like articulating all the information that we're trying to give to patients. I think that's where things fall apart, where there's not communication between the patient and the provider, there's always communica tion but with a translator, it doesn't always translate back to [being understood]. \" Vision of a Health y Franklin County , continued 14 Access to other community resources supporting health, like nutritious foods and recreation spaces are also present in residents' visions of a healthy community. In one community discussion, community members brought up the concept of co-located grocery stores and medical services, specifically a pay -what -you-can-afford concept in a Columbus neighborhood. To some who lived in the area this resource was unfamiliar, sparking discussion on how information about resources is shared within the communi ty and the benefit of having more centralized and affordable resources in Franklin County. Other features of healthy communities brought up by community members included: Funding infrastructure improvements in roads and schools Strong educational and job opportunities Diversity \"Good \" public transportation \"A healthy community, to me, has access to things like fresh foods and produce and groceries .\" \"When I think healthy, I'm thinking things like fresh water, fresh food, or good food to eat. I think nutrition. \" \"Healthy food opti ons that are affordable .\" \"Grocery stores, being in a place where there's not an accessible grocery store. Not a family dollar, like fresh produc e.\" \"It also has the presence of those other kind of social activities that promote health, like walking trails and bike paths, things like that. \" \"I think physical activity .\" \"I would say local rec centers or the availability to your neighborhood or community to utilize them. \" \"And a healthy community should have plenty of green spaces for children to play, parks that are kept up for exercise .\" Important Health Issues 15 This section details what Franklin County residents perceive to be the most important health issues in their communitie s. Community Voices on Important Health Issues Difficulty accessing health care services, poor mental health, and barriers to healthy eating habits were often mentioned in community discussions about the most important health issues facing community members . One of the most frequently mentioned health issues was the prohibitive cost of health care and prescriptions . Community members specified this was a problem even for people who had health insurance. Mistrust in the health care system is another issue preventing optimal community health . Community members spoke to the difficulty of feeling confident that health care services are in their best interest when the costs of this feel exploitative . People of color have additional difficulty trusting the health care system due to fear of receiving less quality care , along with fear of being stereotype d or exposed to racist behavior from health care professionals. \"Cost of healthcare in general. It's not only people sometimes don't have the right coverages, but out of pocket, it's just tremendously expensive. \" \"I spent a two-year span of time where my choice was either to pay for my insurance and not be able to afford the medical care or not be insured and be able to pay for medical care kind of out of pocket, which seems crazy, but the reality was, you know, sometimes you get in a situation where even though the copay makes it easier. You can't afford both at the same time. \" \"I am insured, but the deductible is so high, I can't afford to use it. I've needed scans for two years, but I'm still paying for the one that I had two years ago. So do I want to go have another one? \" \"I think another problem is people can't afford their medications, you get it and it jumps, astronomical prices. I don't know. I think some people go without it because they can't afford it or they have to make a really tough decision about what can they pay. \" \"And personally, I've had to make the decision between do I want to go talk to the doctor or get some sort of checkup for myself to try and address what I feel like I'm dealing with? Or do I want to be able to pay for the prescriptions that I have coming up in the month? \" \"Can't afford their prescriptions .\" Important Health Issues , continued 16 Other issues related to health care access mentioned by community members included : Difficulty scheduling appointments due to lack of available providers, leading to overuse of emergency services Difficulty keeping the same provider long -term, due to provide rs changing practices Lack of medical facilities Lack of community outreach on importance of breastfeedi ng Children lacking early intervention for developmental issues Lack of affordable in -home providers for elderly care Lack of affordable elder care facilities COVID -19 vaccine misinformation Scarce mental health resources / insurance coverage Health insurance access for the homeless population Poor m ental health was another common response across community discussions about the most important health issues . Specifically, many community members brought up depression, anxiety, and stress , and how they are caused or influenced by a variety of societal issues (including COVID -19). As one community member emphasized, mental health is important for how it affects o verall health and quality of life. \"Lack of trust in the healthcare system.\" \"Lack of trust in the healthcare professionals because a lot of people perceive healthcare industry as a business which is there just to make money off of them, so that lack o f trust is a big issue.\" \"There's a big lack of trust with doctors for me in my community. It's like we don't want to go there. Soon as we get to the hospital, somebody is diagnosed with something and then a month or two later, they're dead. We kind of ei ther don't want to know or when we get to the hospital we're basically on our death bed. So there's a lot of lack of trust, and I think that that probably has to do with the information that we're fed. We don't know that we're poisoning ourselves or not ex ercising or whatever it is that our personal body needs. We don't get to help it.\" \"The reluctance of pain doctors to provide patients medication to alleviate their pain. There was a Western Virginia University study by Caucasian interns, and the question was posed, 'Do you believe African -Americans have a higher pain threshold than anybody else around? ' And they truly still believe that. That's so prevalent in our society that these stigmas are attached to individuals that look like me. And that's going to have to be something that's going to have to be changed because that statement is not getting patie nts adequate medication to alleviate their pain. We're not lying when we say we're in pain. We're human.\" Important Health Issues , continued 17 \"I think right now, it's like loneliness, feeling lonely. I know kids have to spend almost all day long alone because parents are working, and now even parents have been lonely because they don't have work.\" \"Some people may not necessarily be in the right mind space to have to go into work, especially people with some sort of disability where working from home might have been easier, and then transitioning back into the office may not be so easy for them. Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of kind of like social anxiety that comes with that, going back toward everything kind of being back to normal .\" \"I think that COVID has caused a lot of anxiety. \" \"People take [political issues] so seriously as to divide communities. It enables them to be divided because we believe different ideologies and stuff, all these go to put stress on the general community. \" \"And when you have, you know, you have a lot of stress and strife, then that isn't good for your health. Because of concerns about crime, and, you know, there is just so much violence. This day that hits it's fearful for older people, especial ly to worry about getting out into the environment, then you don't know what's going to happen to you. So it's a very frightening time. \" \"Depression and anxiety. So many people are suffering from depression and anxiety...because what is going on in socie ty and that is affecting them mentally. They're talking about this lack of togetherness...race...increase in hate. \" \"So I would say that mental health is probably the number one issue, mainly because, if you don't have good mental health, you're not going to have good physical health because you're not going to want to get up and go do anything. \" Lack of affordable places to find fresh, good quality foods was also deemed an important health issue. \"Lack of healthy food, like restaurants, but particularly grocery stores. I feel like they're hidden, and then they're small, and then they're not always the freshest. And if they are, they're very expensive.\" \"Maybe even affordable, healthy restaurants. Most of your local restaurants are pretty exp ensive. I know they're above [my budget]. And I mean, I make pretty good money, but if I'm going there it's usually something special.\" \"My grocery store immediately in my area is not good. I usually come down here and shop at Grove port. I actually, hones tly, I will go into old Grove port because the Kroger in my area, the quality of food and the prices are not quality food and does not match the price.\" Important Health Issues , continued 18 Community members also spoke to a lack of knowledge on how to practice healthy eating behaviors , as well as the underestimation of nutrition's importance for overall health outcomes. Additional health issues mentioned by community members include: Ease of accessing alcohol and other addictive / unhealthy substances Drug addiction Cancer Diseases transmitted sexually or via needles Gun violence Lack of knowledge of community resources Proactive attitudes to change health behaviors Youth education outcomes suffering during COVID -19 Lack of parenting knowledge Poor dental health and access to dental care Lack of resources supporting hygiene for homeless individuals Unemploymen t Poor water quality Lack of transportation and accessible transportation for seniors Lack of resources for infants' basic needs (clean diapers, formula) \"I think also it's a matter of being educated about getting healthy habits from being a young child, exercisin g, eating fruits and vegetables. And a lot of our people are not willing to do that. You see children going to school with chips and candy. You see teachers in school giving out candy to as an incentive. I'm from Canada, so we never do that.\" \"We get acce ss to these really great vegetables from these farmers markets and from these pop -ups and these food banks and whatever, but people don't know how to cook them. So it's like, 'Great. Now what? ' So I feel like there's steps that are missing, in the in betwe en and on the end.\" \"The idea of, okay, what you put into your body on a regular basis directly correlates to, you know, how you feel, and your overall health and stuff like that. Because I think there's a lack of knowledge sometimes regarding that.\" \"Access to healthy foods leading to food -based or consumption -based diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain forms of cancer like colon cancer.\" Priorit y Health Needs 19 This section lists the prioritized health needs of Franklin County. The prioritized health needs affecting Franklin County residents, as identified by the Franklin County HealthMap2022 Steering Committee , include: basic needs; racial equity ; behavioral health; and maternal -infant health. These health issues are interrelated, and in many cases are likely co -occurring. For example, the effects of redlining still impact basic needs and health care access for disadvantaged racial and ethnic groups, and t hose experiencing homelessness and hous ing insecurity may face compromised mental health as a result. Basic needs are the first highest prior ity. This is comprised of the following specific and interrelated indicators : housing security ; financial stability ; neighborhood safety ; food security ; and a need for increased access to nutritious foods . Priority # 1: Basic Needs Specific indicators See pages Housing security (decreased homelessness, increased affordability) 33-35 Financial stability 32-33 Neighborhood safety (reduced crime) 49-50 Food security 35-36 Increased access to nutritious foods 76-79 Racial equity is tied with behavioral health as the second highest priority. Practices of r acial and ethnic discrimination , including redlining, preclude residents ' access to economic stability, quality health care services, and optimal maternal and infant health outcomes , among other health needs. Priority # 2a: Racial Equity Specific indicators See pages (Effects on) Economic and housing stability 32-34 (Effects on) Quality healthcare, mental health, and feelings of safety 51-53 (Effects on) Maternal and infant health outcomes 85-91 Behavioral health is tied with r acial equity as the second highest priority. Poor mental health outcomes persist for many in Franklin County, and residents may have difficulty finding a mental health professional they trust to help them. Existing mental health care services may be underutilized due to the stigma associated with seeking mental health support. Priori ty Health Needs , continued 20 Priority # 2b: Behavioral Health Specific indicator s See pages Access to mental health care resources 31, 61-62 Screening for mental health issues 95-99 Decreased unintentional drug and alcohol deaths 74 Youth mental health supports (clinical, social) 99-101 The third highest priority for Franklin County is maternal and infant health, which is comprised of the need to reduce the rate of infant mortality and the need to improve maternal pre -pregnancy health. Priority # 3: Maternal -Infant Health Specific indicators See pages Infant mortality 85-87 Maternal pre -pregnancy health 89-92 Page 129 of this report presents a list of potential partners , resources , and community assets that could potentially help to address these prioriti zed health needs. For context, Ohio's 20 20-2022 State Health I mprovement Plan (SHIP) identified three priority health topics (or, general areas of focus) that communities should consider when planning to improve the population's health. These three priority health topics include mental health and addiction, chronic disease, and mate rnal and infant health , as shown below . For each of these priority health topics, Ohio 's 2020-2022 SHIP also identified specific p riority health outcomes , which are listed in the table below . Overall, there is a good alignment between the prioritized health needs identified by HealthMap20 22 and Ohio's 20 20-2022 SHIP. Health Priority Topics And Outcomes Identified By Ohio's 20 20-2022 SHIP Mental Health and Addiction Chronic Disease Maternal and Infant Health Depression Suicide Youth drug use Drug overdose deaths Heart disease Diabetes Childhood conditions (asthma, lead) Preterm births Infant mortality Maternal morbidity Priori ty Health Needs , continued 21 Lastly, it should be noted that several other health issues were also considered by the Steering Committee as part of this prioritization process . Although these other issues play an important role in affecting the health of Franklin County residents, they did not receive the same level of endorsement as compared to the priority health needs reviewed previously . The other health issues considered by the Steering Committee are listed below. Cancer screening Decreased alcohol use (especially among youth) Decreased firearm injuries Decreased sedentary lifestyle behaviors Decreased tobacco use (especially among youth) Healthy blood pressure Improved high school graduation rates Improved pandemic readiness Increased access to health care Increased health literacy Increased physical activity resources Increased safe mobility for elderly Lower rates of STIs/HIV Reduced geographic disparities in health outcomes Community Profile 22 This section provides demographic information about Franklin County 's residents and households.

Key Findings Health Care Access Though most residents have health insurance, Franklin County still does not meet the national goal for residents under 65 with health insurance. Community members say health insurance is not enough to make costs of health care accessible to everyone. Income & Poverty While various measures show increasing household incomes and decreasing rates of food insecurity since the previous HealthMap , these data do not yet reflect the effects of COVID -19 on these factors . More current data may present a less positive change in these indicators. Education The overall graduation rate of high school students in Franklin County exceed s the national goal . However, rates of graduation for Black and African American a s well as Hispanic students are still lower than overall rates and rates for other groups. Social & Community Context Franklin County residents are affected by rates of v iolent and property crime similar to the previous HealthMap . Other social factors impeding optimal health outcomes include racism , which results in disparities in health care quality and utility, as well as mental health outcomes and access to resources. Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 25 Health Care Access Indicator s This section describes indicators of a population's access to health care : health insurance status, as well as accounts of other fac tors impeding access according to community members. The percentage of Franklin County residents that have health insurance coverage has remained similar to the previous HealthMap . Individuals With Health Insurance Franklin County Ohio Franklin County residents have private health insurance (69.3%) than public health coverage . Public health insurance rates in Franklin County have remained similar to the previous HealthMap . Medicaid coverage has increased since the previous HealthMap, and the percentage of residents with this coverage in Franklin County is higher than the national average. The total persons under 65 with health insurance in Franklin County is 91.1%, lower than the state but higher than the national average (89.2%). The state of Ohio meets the national goal at 92.2%, while Franklin County does not. Franklin County: 91.1%1 Target: 92.1%4 Percent of residents under age 65 with health insurance Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 26 Community Voices on Health Care Costs On the topic of health care access, community members frequently mentioned how the expenses associated with medical care can influence whether people get the care they need. As community members see it, having insurance is only part of health care access , as utilizing health care also depends on understanding their insurance , being able to find a medical provider who takes it, and being able to pay any costs left over. Those who lack insurance for various reasons may not know how to get coverage , or how to get care if they are uninsured. Those who have insurance may still struggle with knowing where they can go that takes their insurance, and otherwise understanding how their insurance works. \"I know some people don't have Medicaid or Medicare. And you don't have private insurance. You don't have any insurance. They cannot afford to pay for health insurance ...\" \"Having health insurance and the type of job that offers you benefits that will get you those type of things is anot her barrier to access .\" \"And so, a lot of people can't afford that ...dental and vision is very important to the elderly. But this has got to come out of your pocket. \" \"Having the proper information about where to go to find out what insurance what you can obtain, that's also an issue. Not having the proper information and knowing exactly where to go to get that information to obtain the insurance that you may need. \" \"Then misinformation. Like anything that you have to meet a certain criterion to have cover age, or, again, that could be coming from loved ones that don't know any better. They just kind of perpetuate that lie. \" \"Yeah, so it's like something you have to deal with, but it's not so easy. Like, you have some doctors that say one thing you know. Just a lot of like, not enough specialists for her, you know, her fingers turn blue, so you get a whole breaks out in hives. So it's just like, there's not a lot of doctors that would take her insurance so it's hard to find somebody that specialize s in something that she needs or medici ne or anything so it's really hard like that. \" \"There's the struggling to understand your co -pays, where you're supposed to go for your insurance, and all that jazz .\" \"I don't know if anybody's ever actually tried to read all your insurance documents, bu t it's written at the senior college level, and it's like reading a court document. It's so much, mine's so thick. I can't even start to fathom to memorize all this and even know what half of it means ...\" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 27 Individuals may not be able to afford the cost after insurance. Their copay or deductible can be too high, and they can have additional anxiety about what other costs they may be burdened with after a medical visit. For those who have insurance, it may not cover everything they need . Especially dental care, vision care, or prescriptions . Community members expressed concern that people may put off th ose types of care for this reason , or ration medication due to financial concerns . Cost concerns can also prohibit individuals from accessing needed mental health care . \"And beyond even the copay, even if you can afford the copay, there's always the anxiety once you go in what mystery bill you'll either come out with or, how much is this test you obviously didn't know about, or this medication that they prescribed. Or your deductible. Maybe you got a $2000 deductible on your medical, and that's $2000 you're going to owe anyway whether you have insurance or not. \" \"But then on the other sid e is that, once you've seen the doctor, the doctor asks you to do something, the prior authorizations for medicine, the fighting back and forth to get labs or things done and covered. The fact that your doctor can say, 'This is what I want for you ,' and your insurance can still say , 'Absolutely not.' \" \"For me personally, I won't go to a doctor's visit if I have to pay a certain amount for a copay. \" \"Or even if you have insurance, you may be laid off and your savings account got drained because you weren't making as much. So now you can't afford the copay, and you normally would be able to. So you're wondering how to deal with that. \" \"The cost of copays depends on your insurer. Like she was saying, you don't get the same doctor you had before t he pandemic, so everything switched up. And then they find a reason to charge you more for it. \" \"I was only able to go to a certain number of counseling sessions that my job had paid for. So I mean, insurance only covers so much. \" \"A lot of times you can't go and see a counselor because of the expense. \" \"And a lot of self-diagnosis, especially going on Google and looking up your symptoms. That's the worst thing you can do. And then of course we're ruminating about the problem of the industry where costs is always going to be there for every decision. So of course you'r e going to go online first. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 28 OTHER SOCIAL DETERMINANTS IMPACTING HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION Cost is only one factor impacting individuals' access to health care. The availability of medical providers is another factor and is explored in detail in the following section (Health Resource Availability ). Other issues affecting residents ' decisions to delay or put off needed health car e are explained here. Community Voices on General Health Care Utilization Individual s' attitudes toward the health care system , specifically whether they have built a relationship of trust with the medical community, was regarded as a major factor impacting how individuals take advantage of health care resources . Perceiving health care as a low priorit y was also seen to impact this, along with various other factors (discussed below). Racial discrimination is one reason individuals may not trust medical providers . Black and African American community members in particular spoke about their community's experience s receiv ing inadequate health care . \"I think that has to do with discrimination somehow because it 's been said that when you go to the emergency as a Black female, there are few chances for them to believe that you are i n pain. A couple of years ago, I was dealing with a gallbladder issue. It was excruciating, and they let me sit there for hours to find out that I needed a surgery right away ...So as a Black woman, any way you go to get care, even if you 're about to deliver, they just don 't believe it when you say that you 're dying. \" \"I went hunched over in pain. They let me wait, wait, wait, wait, and it turns out a cyst had burst in my left ovary. I needed emergency surgery. But at this point, you guys have let me sit here. It 's like if I 'm not screaming, blood pouring out, if I'm able to handle myself a little bit, then [they think] I must not be in that much pain. How can you look at somebody and they have something going on, on the inside, and you tell them that they 're okay? So after that, I wouldn 't go to the hospital. I would just tough it out. And then, once I finally did get my insurance and went to the doctor, I had another growth. It could have been taken care of if I did have that kind of trust factor and wasn 't afraid that I 'm just going there getting another bill. Because at that point, that 's all it is, is I 'm paying to get no help. \" \"Everything 's overlooked a lot of times. Even if you go to the ER and you think you know what 's wrong with you, but they... You know what I mean? They could think you 're just faking it, or you just want [pain medication] . They overlook a lot of patients that end up going home and finding out that they had something seriously wrong with them. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 29 Individuals who have Medicaid or other public health insurance may have difficulty building relationships of trust with their medical providers . Community members perceived that affordable health care options for this population may be worse quality. In these conversations c ommunity members also spoke about issues receiving good quality medical care as influenced by the ability to see the same provider consistently . This was perceived to encourage quality care in terms of thorough knowledge of a patien t's medical history and pain threshold , which in turn supported strong relationships with providers and utilization of medical care. COVID -19 demonstrated how individuals may increasingly see k medical advice from sources other than medical professionals . This can increase confusion and negatively impact utilization of health care services that support optimal health. \"Using Facebook as your information outlets. There 's a lot of negative messages in Facebook that sometimes stops people from going and get the COVID vaccine. \" \"I think also a lack of trus t on a larger scale in the actual institutions that are handing down information like governmental organizations \u2014Department of Health, CDC. I feel like people in our communities, they 're getting all this information from the internet ...Or the things that the y're hearing on like TikTok and Instagram don 't align with the things that hear from the CDC. They are hearing these things from people in their communities that they trust. So when those things don 't align, they don 't know where to turn. \" \"I'd say a lot of it also had to do with information overload and kind of confused thing. ...You have like 20 different sources telling you different things. That kind of makes you freeze in your tracks and ultimately do nothing ...and making some problems worse. So I definitely think that too much information is a big problem for not getting treatment in a good amount of time. \" \"To go to a place that doesn't take your insurance, you got to pay out of pocket. That's too much, so you'll go to a place that will accept your insurance, but they kind of treat you like a number because that's how they get their funding pretty much is by how many people they see...The healthcare that you can go to for free is kind of not up to par, and that's from my personal experience over probably the last two, three years, honestly. So I think that is the biggest thing, just being treated like a number when you're going to the only place you can go to get your healthcare.\" \"There is sometimes with some providers, a stigma that comes with having health insurance through Medicaid, public benefit, need where your quality of care is reduced, as opposed to ha ving private insurance, where everyone is treated, you know, with equity.\" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 30 Aside from issues of trust, individuals may be too busy with other commitments, like work and caretaking, to feel like taking time for h ealth care . Additionally, they may fear finding out that they have a medical issue that will threaten their ability to work. Community members mentioned that fear of a diagnosis , as well as famil y or cultur al beliefs and behaviors surrounding medicine can impact whether people get health care when they need it . These responses are summarized below. Not want ing to deal with a diagnosis that require s ongoing care or monitoring Fear that they will be advised to change their lifestyle and what they consume Orientation of family members to going to the doctor, or not going Cultural beliefs that emphasize home remedies for an illness before seeking advice from a medical professional Previously this section discussed the broader, and potentially long -term effects of COVID -19 on people's attitudes toward medical care . Some short -term impacts of COVID -19 on health care utilization were brought up in community discussions and are summarized below . Individuals putting off routine medical visits out of fear of exposure to COVID -19 Individuals putting off health concerns or medical visits they deemed \"not major\" and choosing to wait until \"things opened up\" Individuals who formerly provided transportation assistance for the ir elderly family members to get to medical appointments not doing this due to fear of putting the elderly at risk \"Busy life, they just put it off until tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, until it 's an emergency. \" \"I think sometimes people who are caregivers will put themselves last. I think during COVID a lot of people put a lot of their own needs second, especially like moms, dads, people who are caring for their own family, extended families, their own aging parents. They are considering thei r children and their aging parents before they 're considering themselves. So they kind of get the people who need care who are the most able bodied, sometimes leave mental health and also maybe smaller medical issues to just linger. \" \"We don 't do enough o f the preventative care, I think, as a society, as a community. I think we only go to the doctor if something 's wrong. And I think it 's because of our negative experiences when there was something wrong. You don't want to hear it. I have a neighbor who is a contracted employee. If he doesn 't work, he doesn 't get pai d. If something is wrong with him, his family goes hungry because he 's the only breadwinner in the family. He doesn 't go to the doctor regularly. He doesn 't do what he needs to do ...the time associated with taking time off do those things. Those are barriers that we don 't have safeguards in place to ensure that everyone has the abilit y.\" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 31 Community Voices on Mental Health Care Utilization Access to mental health care is complicated by the stigma associated with mental illness. People who could benefit from mental health care may not recognize they need it or be willing to accept they have an issue . \"Sometimes you don't even know you need help. I think a lot of times, we may not even recognize when we need help.\" \"They think they could stop it on their own, and then that's not really how it works. The thing is people don't want to accept the fact that there's something wrong with them to get help. It hinders a lot of people .\" Being validated by others that it's appropriate to seek help is important . This is made more difficult due to socio -cultural beliefs that link mental illness to weakness. \"Proper emotional focus on actually taking that seriously. It used to be getting looks and misunderstood. The entire family would brush it off. \" \"If your family is not supportive, and those around you are not supportive, then it's hard to go. \" \"Black people, they don't need mental health, or...we've just been told you don't need that or that's for weak people or whatever... \" \"From my African background, where depression, things like that isn't really spoken of. Especially if you mentioned something like that, you know, they take a biblical approach. Or they'll give you old village examples. It's like none of those are appropriate. \" \"Coming from a man's perspective, masculinity is [important] when it comes to not seeking help because it shows a sign of weakness...they don't discuss it with their buddies ...we're supposed to be men. We believe it on the inside. \" People may fear being judged if they open up about needing help. \"You fear being judged if you do need to seek a therapist or counselor .\" \"People might be embarrassed or ashamed of certain situations, so they don't want to address it .\" \"Not exactly a popular thing to go and see a counselor or talk to somebody that you feel that way as well .\" Also mentioned was the general fear of trusting medical providers with information about their mental state , and fear that this information could potentially be used against them . Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 32 Income/ Poverty Indicators This section describes income and poverty indicators that affect health , including household income, rates of homelessness and other measures of housing insecurity, and food insecurity . In Franklin County, the me dian net household income is $ 64,713 , which is higher than the median in Ohio, but slightly lower than the national figure. There is a higher percentage of families living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) in Franklin County than in Ohio or the United States. However, t he percentages of families and children living 100% below FPL have decreased since the previous HealthMap (12.5% to 10.0 % for families and 2 4.5% to 18.4 % for children). A similar percentage of children enrolled in school in Franklin County are eligible for free or reduced lunch compared to the previous HealthMap .

This absence of opportunity is visible in the present through its impact on the health, socioeconomic, and racial/ethnic disparities of historically redlined neighborhoods10-12. Lowest Median Household Income in Franklin County7 HOUSING INSECURITY Housing insecurity is a term encompassing many different housing challenges, including affordability, quality, and safety. Homeless ness is the most severe form of housing insecurity , and is measured here using A \"Point in Time Count\" (PIT) estimate , a count of th e total number of people experiencing homelessness (sheltered and unsheltered) on a single night of the year. A count of individuals, as well as the percentage of homeless families (denoted by \"persons in families\") is shown on the next page . Homeless persons were considered part of a family if they were in a group consisting of at least one adult and at least one child under age 18 . Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 34 In Franklin County , the PIT estimate is higher than the previous HealthMap , and t he percentage of homeless using an emergency shelter who are part of a family has remained similar . About three -quarters of families using emergency shelters in Franklin County are African American (75%), well over the composition of African American families in shelters in emergency shelters in Ohio (53.1%) .

Households who spend over 30% of the total household income on housing related costs are at increased risk of housing insecurity.

In 2016, the Eviction Lab at Princeton University found that Columbus ' eviction rate was 4.6 per 100 renter homes, which was similar to the eviction rates in Cleveland (4.6) and Cincinnati (4.7). In other Midwestern cities, the eviction rate varies from 1.1 in Chicago, to 5.2 in Detroit, Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 35 and 7.3 in Indianapolis . More recent ly (from July 18, 2021 - August 23, 2021), Eviction Lab data suggests that census tracts in eastern Fran klin County are associated with a large number of eviction filings .16 Census Tracts With Greatest Number of Eviction Filings16 FOOD INSECURITY Food insecurity is another indicator of poverty . The USDA describes food insecurity as the \"limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways .\"17 In Franklin County, 1 2.8% of residents are food insecure. With data re flecting 2019 rates , this percentage does not represent food insecurity experienced during the COVID -19 pandemic . More recent data may provide higher estimates of food insecurity .

Also mentioned was poverty's impact on mental health, nutrition, and housing outcomes. Community members discussed how poverty limits the places individuals can go for health care and impacts which staff members treat them. \"So a lot of places don't want to deal with people that have any kind of Medicaid unless it's straight up Medicaid because then they know they'll get paid. So I think a lot of people have that problem being treat ed badly because of that. \" \"And I've noticed that when you go to healthcare clinics or facilities of any sort, if you don't have decent type of coverage, they'll send their students, they being the doctors who are specialists of that area or just the inter nists. \" \"The quality of care you receive is based on your economic level. So that's very disheartening. So then you do get the kids who are right out of medical school. They're probably getting some incentive. They're only going to work in these clinics fo r a very short period of time, and then they're going to be gone. \" \"You are experimental. Whether it's dentistry, whether it's heart surgery, it does not matter. I've se en it. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 37 Poverty was linked with having less insurance coverage or unaffordable deductibles. \"Part of the reason you're in poverty, too , would be a low -paying job. And being that most of our healthcare is employer tied, some of those low -paying jobs might not have the same healthcare that someone making more money might inherently have, so they're already at a disadvantage. \" \"First of all, it causes so many health issues, because you can't afford the medication or the medical things that you need. \" \"I feel like preventative medicine being covered by insurance is almost laughable. Like, 'Oh we've got the annual things .' Then you're like, okay, well I have a tumor in my lungs like I did last year. And they were like, 'Oh, we can't pay it. Because we co uld not have foreseen that this was coming .' And like, it just was so crushing to me that when I saw the list of things that were covered, and then when I needed care for something in my lung, they were like, you have to meet your $5,000 deductible. \" People in poverty may have to put off health care or may practice more unhealthy behaviors in order to save money for basic needs that come first: child care , housing, and transportation . \"From a caretaker perspective, anytime, again, you're responsible for kids or loved one and whoever it may be, your needs/desires, whatever it is, end up coming last. So it's making sure that the $9 bottle of formula or the healthier lunch alternatives for my daughter are there. All of a sudden, I'm eating ra men noodles or I'm grabbing $5 pizza from Little Caesars because I can eat twice off that. But I also know that means that I'll have the good formula for my son to eat.\" \"The less money you have, the more financially driven your decision -making is. This country is so money driven that healthcare is going to come last when you have rent, and you have kids. Or if you work 60/80 hours a week just to take care of bills... Your first priority is always going to make sure you have a roof over your house . Like will I have a roof over my house ? Do I have food to eat? Can I physically survive? Like I'm not homeless. So that's like your main concern if you're in povert y. That's what you're worrying about. You're not worrying about what's this weird bump I h ave on my hand? Why am I feeling different? \" \"That rings so true for me and people in my life too. It's just like there's so many things I need to take care of and pay for: and loans and bills. Be able to have a car to drive to work and be able to go to w ork. I'm like there's just so many lists of things I have to do, care for, pay for. Like my health is the absolute bottom every time. Every time. \" \"There used to be when I was younger, you used to be able to sign off on a form for elementary school kids t o be like, oh, you can give them dental care, and then they'll take them to a teeth cleaning for free vaccines or whatever. And now at most schools that won't happen. It would have made it easier for parents with Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 38 taking off from work. Because the school ta kes care of it, you give consent, they're able to get it. So there's, that's often the people can't take off from work, and that's an issue with the income .\" Poverty has a negative impact on the mental health of adults and youth. \"Having a lack of resources, and the parent gets stressed out and that affects how they parent .\" \"I also think like if you can put a roof over your family's head and dinner on the table, th ose are two like very stabilizing things for our family. So, you've also reduced like mental health stress... \" \"I think it makes it makes [mental health] worse because I think if you're in poverty, you're usually depressed .\" \"They see these kids come with name brands, and these kids who can't afford name brands get teased, and that can cause depression. And when they go home, they're asking their parents. 'Oh, so -and-so has this. I want you to buy me this.' And the parents can't afford it. \" Poverty impacts the ability of people to get adequate, nutritious food. It also limits what people are able to eat if they don't have utilities or the resources to cook food. \"Some of the children in the poor area, they might go all day and not even have food. \" \"You have to talk about food and either for lack of time and energy from working, they don't have opportunities to prepare food at home. Sometimes it's cheaper to get something that's not as good quality. \" \"Healthy food is expensive. Cheap fo od is like fattening food. You're going to go for it if you're lacking the funds. Buy whatever's the cheapest. \" \"It affects all of them because you have different point of view depending on how much money you have. If you have somebody that makes 200 gran d and I make 50 grand, our perspective on everything's going to be different. That $20 lettuce wrap is going to be affordable. Or if you make 20 grand a year in your household, you can't even afford the cheeseburger at McDonald's. \" \"I mean, there's just m ore checks and balances that need to go in place to just give people a box of food or produce. I don't know what his situation is, but one of the panhandlers, someone gave him a whole box of produce. I'm thinking, 'Well, what is he going to do ?' He didn't look like he had the facilities to wash it [or cook it] .\" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 39 Those affected by poverty may have increased residential mobility due to rising housing costs in gentrified areas. The standard of housing they can afford may also compromise their health outcomes. \"Several people reported to me that they're being evicted from their apartment complex. They've stayed many years and paid their rent faithfully ...But their lease is not going to be renewed, and now they're scrabbling to find places ...The elderly that's in the communities th at have no people that give them support ...\" \"I think what's really sad, too, kind of like what you were saying, people live in certain apartment complex, and then someone comes in and buys them, fixes them up, and then jacks the rent up. And now they're 40 0 to 500 extra monthly. The people who are living there can't afford it, so they have to leave and find other places to live. \" \"And I don't think there's a lot of HUD housing and oh there's not enough for these people that we need. So instead there's thes e big buildings that are like $1,200 a month for a one bedroom. Build, you know, condominiums for women and children and people who are pregnant. You know what I mean? Build all that for the communities that have so much, women, children, families out on the streets seeking shelters for hope. And then they're overcrowded, and they're pushed back, and they're pushed away. So I see a lot of that going on. \" \"Like the gentrification issue. So it is really great that this area of Franklinton is being built up, but where all those native Franklinton people to go then? They're getting booted out. \" \"So he says equal housing. So that means like, the place you live is the same as this person and this person, but that's not the case. They're slumlords. And there's pe ople who just don't want to... take care of property. It's barely livable...causing all the low self -esteem for the people who live in the neighborhood. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 40 Education Indicators This section describes education indicators including the highest educational level attained by adult residents , kindergarten readiness, 3rd grade reading proficiency , and graduation rates .

They did mention how those with lower levels of formal education may be less confident asking questions related to their health in medical visits and engaging in self -advocacy. Communities need more accessible and quality education about how to be healthy , involving nutrition, vaccines, and life skills like money management. \"So we have mentioned the understanding of being able to be healthy and have an understanding of nutrition, right? And that's important to know how to be healthy, but somebody has to teach you that, right? And so if people don't have that access to education, they don't have access to what I would argue is the currency of freedom...It's the freedom to be able to make decisions that you want to make versus you'd have to make. It's the freedom to understand the implications of the decisions that you make down the line. \" \"If access t o formal education is one [issue], then access to quality information is two. Whether I have a formal education or not, if I have access to the type of information that can educate myself on the things that I need, that's equally important. There's a value to that, that I think we underestimate because making information available to people, there's information in all of these informal spaces that we don't capitalize on to make sure people are able to educate themselves on the issues that matter to them. \" \"We need to be informed in a way in which the layman can understand. \" \"My country has a better understanding about vaccination than this country, and it's really like a third world. How is that possible? I mean, honestly, how is that possible? This countr y has a lot of potential to do things way better. But the point is, we're targeting political issues, money issues, instead of health issues. \" \"I think that health information needs to be given out more consistently on a regular basis and needs to be on the TV. \" \"But exposure to other things really lacks, you know, in some communities, where you have children, no one's ever even seen what zucchini looks like or vegetables outside of their dreams? You know, I mean, things like that. So, it's like exposure sometimes that doesn't exist in formal education, or just education period .\" \"Sometimes in the schools, some of the stuff like that is irrelevant for some kids. Everybody's not going to be a rocket scientist, so they need to teach how to live your life a fter you get out of school. Daily living, how to manage your money... \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 47 The level of self -advocacy individuals engage in when it comes to medical care may be reflective of the skills learned in formal education. \"I know my aunt, she doesn't like to ask questions because she's not very confident. She has a high school education, so I knew she was not going to ask the right questions [at her doctor's appointment] ...I feel like when people lack education, they don't inquire. They feel a little intimidated, so they just accept whatever the medical professional tells them as the gospel truth. No, you need to question. You need to ask. This is what you need to say, and I write things down for her. She still doesn't, so I have to actually show up. \" \"There's a sense of self advocacy that you can't necessarily express what you're thinking. When you're in these moments of high pressure, when you're hearing bad news about your child from your pediatrician, you'll just be like , 'Okay, uh - huh, yes .' But you forget to ask, 'Why am I taking this medicine? How is it going to make it better? What should I do if I see these x, y, and z ?' ...They don't ask questions about who's going to be there, how long is it going to take. And that comes with this special level of training that happens from your parents, but also it happens in school to be okay to ask. \" \"They can go all the way through whatever levels of education, but if we're not giving people the tools to think for themselves, t hey're thinking about asking this question, they're like, 'Well, why is that like that? What does that mean ?' Even stuff like what does that mean. So that critical thinking that often happens later on in education, but can happen earlier in school, can be inserted into any curriculum. Critical thinking is important to self -advocacy. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 48 Employment Indicators This section describes employment indicators that are related to other social determinants and future health outcomes , namely employment status and occupation .

On the following pages , non-White community members detail the impact that racial and ethnic identities have on their health outcomes, and how racism forms barriers to achieving their full health potential. Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 51 Community Voices on Racial Barriers to Health Equity Community members spoke about their experiences being Black and African American, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino in Franklin County. They see race impacting health in the quality of medical care received, increased mental stress and untreated mental illness , and the way structural racism forms communities with inadequate basic needs: like safety and access to nutrition. Community members recounted personal experiences of feeling their race influenced them to get a low quality of care at a medical facility. Being perceived as a racial stereotype, having their demographic unrepresented in medical staff , and needing a translator for services can result in racial and ethnic minorities havi ng a poor experience with the health care system. \"I heard a lot of stories where people died from lack of care in a hospital. They don't even check on you or they just treat you a certain type of way. I just heard a lot of stories this year about stuff like that happening in hospitals. And [African Americans] are not examined...However, I went to the urgent care at least two to three different times because of what was going on. At least two of those three times, I was not even examined. \" \"She sai d she was near death pretty much, and they weren't believing her, and I think it probably has a lot to do with the color of her skin. \" \"I get treated like that, like, 'Oh, it's not time yet, ' or 'Oh, we do see you have a whole bunch of cysts on your ovari es, but we're going to give you some Tylenol. Go home. ' And so I don't know what else it is. And I can feel it when they're in my face , I can feel it, like they think I just want medicine. And it's a big problem. And I know many, many African American wome n who deal with that, especially at the emergency room, in the hospital, where you're going because you don't have another choice. It's a sick, sad problem. \" \"We don't trust our doctors because we think that they just put us in a group...or we are illegal aliens to them that don't matter. Oh, you're Hispanic and Latina? I get scared to check that mark sometimes on paper. \" \"She touched on it a bit about not seeing people who look like you. You know, that is a big difference for people. It does perpe tuate a lack of trust or that massive fear. And so, you know, I have several friends in the medical field. Like OB or nurse midwives and nurses. I think it's about less than 10% here in the state of Ohio are Black women, as far as OB. But look how many Black women there are here or even Latina women. A lot of times, you see a White man. \" \"From what my friends have told me, some doctors are really accommodating. They really want to treat the patient well. Other doctors are annoyed that they have to try to communicate with somebody through a translator. So I think that adds another level of how well a person feels like they're being treated or how well they actually are being treated based on language barrier. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 52 Community members spoke about the mental strain of dealing with racism and other forms of discrimination , and the compounding issue of stigma related to seeking help for poor mental health. \"That's another reason why there's so much drug addiction, so much drinking and es capism and not watching politics, unfortunately. It's because life is so incredibly burdensome living here [as a Black person]. \" \"Well, as an Asian person, I think that it has greatly affected the Asian community. Ever since President Trump had said that it was the Wuhan virus or the China virus, there have been so many more attacks on the Asian community and more questions to me...So I think that it does magnify the virus in that you feel like you're getting blamed for it in a way, which is very unfair, b ut also, you have this anxiety and stress of the virus itself. And so it just magnifies the issues. \" \"There's a thing called the chronic stress hypothesis, which thinks about things like racism and the way that it systemically functions in our society, right? So being a Black woman in America, being a Black man in America, being an Asian woman in America, r egardless, the additional stress that comes from the racism you get...So over time, the thought is that the additional stress creates a chronic stress response that is going to cause communities of color not only to have increased rates of like low birth w eight and preterm babies and diabetes, but there are some other genetic predispositions that can be turned on by chronic stress, then we end up with issues like increased risk of dementia, increased risk of mental illness, increased risk of heart disease. \" \"Especially the mixed children. They are very confused if they're White or Black . When they go to school, they're Black , but they know themselves - That's one part of it, but when someone's just saying, 'You're Black , you're Black , you're Black ,' and th ey go in the world just confused. The parents don't talk to them about certain things that they will encounter when they get into the world. Okay, at home, you know that you're mixed, but out in the world, you're going to be labeled Black . So that gets int o their brain, and they deal with that in school because they don't know if they should hang out with White children or Black children. And the White children are not as accepting .\" \"And there's stigma associated with seeking mental health for men as well, or men of color, but different, than women because we are mainly the caretakers of the home and the kids. And so like, if you don't have yourself straight, how are you going to be like taking care of other people. And there's a major, major fear and sometimes misconception about you speaking up, and getting the help you need for saying that you're having a hard time and your kids are going to be taken away to CPS , yes, that's a real thing. Yes, people do come in and take your children away, but it's n ot as rampant ...\" \"And even in like as we were growing up, we were shown not to show a lot of like emotions to other people. So we're not supposed to show any empathy, any anything like emotional wise. So I think it's like when it comes to Hispanic culture, I think that's where they come from. They're taught a lot about not showing what you're actually feeling .\" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 53 Community members talked about how racism makes people feel unsafe, and how neighborhoods with large populations of racial minorities do not have access to the same resources found in predominantly White neighborhoods. \"So the comfort some of us might feel going outside to go for a jog to stay healthy and fit might not be re ceived the same way in different neighborhoods for people of different color. So I think police violence, obviously, as a whole is a systematic health problem to communities, too. \" \"You walk in the door as a Black person, light, brown, dark, light, whatever, you're suddenly a criminal from the get -go. And all of a sudden, the burden is on us to try and prove to you we're one of the good ones. \" \"Maybe it's a matter of the interpretation of the idea of a health cris is. But I mean, there's obvious systemic violence against Black bodies in all communities across America. On behalf of police, on behalf of other community members. I cannot speak to access to health care being a racial issue other than maybe socio -economi c status. But I can certainly see that if we're talking about health on a broad scale, that like violence against Black and people of color is obviously an everyday issue in America everywhere. \" \"They're looking at different pockets of areas and look at w here certain money went. It was like okay; we'll look at this area. This is probably a more White area. This is probably more a nicer area. Things of that sort. So from my experience it won't play a factor face to face, but as we go and look at the stats b y the numbers, you'll see a disparity where one area might be more predominantly White , or one area might be more diverse. \" \"There's even less opportunity for healthy food than there is in more upper -class neighborhoods ...m ost of the customers in that store are foreigners, okay? So, they can throw, they think they can throw that off on them, those old vegetables and stuff and they buy them. \" \"You don't see the meals and the vegetables that's needed in the communities, when you know the health risks are high er. Data proves that especially in communities of color, and African American communities alone, that have high blood pressure, Diabetes, and heart disease are number one. But yet still, you take this door and accessibility away from me that now I have to travel to somewhere where I can't go. But so now we'll go over to Family Dollar, so that racism is real. \" \"And loads of lead levels and chemical wastes in the ground affecting our health that way. \" Social Determinants of Hea lth, continued 54 ENVIRONMENTAL HEATH The American Public Health Association defines environmental health as the branch of public health that focuses on the relat ionships between people and their environment. Franklin County HealthMap 2022 explicitly considered several environmental factors that co ntribute to healthy, safe communities ; these factors are shown in the table on the next page.

Key Findings Health Resource Availability Franklin County residents now have gre ater access to certain types of health care providers (advance practice nurses, physician assistants ). Emergency Health Care Utilization The rate of utilizing emergency rooms for the lowest severity issues decreased since the previous HealthMap . Combining all types of visits, Black and African American residents utilize emergency care at higher rates than other groups. Mental Health Resource Availability Mental health providers have higher ratios of residents to a single practitioner, compared to other types of health practitioners . Community members may face additional difficulty finding a practitioner who can relate to their experiences. Dental Care Access The percent of adults unable to access needed dental care increased since the previous HealthMap. Health Resource Availability, continued 59 HEALTH RESOURCE AVAILABILITY The ratio of Franklin County residents per licens ed physicians (MDs and DOs) is similar to the last HealthMap , with a current ratio of 238:1 , meaning one licensed physician available for every 238 residents. In 2019 the number of residents per licensed physicians was 2 34. However, there has been improvement in the number of advance practice nurses and physician assistants per resident, with ratios decreasing for each of these practitioners. The ratio of Franklin County residents per optometrists has also improved slightly, with a current ratio of one optometrist per 3,530 residents, compared to one optometrist per 3,639 residents in the previous Health Map. Health Care Providers Franklin Co unty Ohio HM2016 Community Voices on Health Resource Availability In addition to the number of health care professionals available per resident, health resource availability also depends on the ease of scheduling and making it to appointments . Community members recounted difficulty finding a medical professional with hours that work with their schedule , specifically the difficulty of managing health appointments along with their work responsibilities. Health Resource Availability, continued 60 \"Right now, if I needed to go to the doctor, I have so much going on. I work with a special project that I can't afford to miss a day of work right now or a couple hours of work to go to the doctor. So that's a reason. If my doctor doesn't have any evening or very late afternoon hours, then it's not likely that I would g et healthcare in until my project is done .\" \"And I think a lot of that is actual employers. I know some people would come to work sick and not go to the doctor. But I work in a new place now, and I remember feeling like, I need to take off for this. And m y supervisor was like, 'Oh, great. ' It's approved. Any time you need to go do something for your health, it's approved. And I'm like, 'Whoa .' But you feel like you can't take that time off. You don't feel encouraged to really take care of yourself because work comes first. And I think getting employers to understand that people feel like that, but they should not make people feel like that would be really helpful, too. \" \"Doctors have pretty much turned into an 8 to 5 service. \" Community members spoke about the benefit of having a medical professional available by phone to help when they aren't sure if they need to see a doctor, and to answer questions quickly. While t he COVID -19 pandemic led to increased use of telemedicine options in place of in person appointments , telemedicine has its own barriers to accessibility. It can be difficul t for members of the population to access \"virtual visits\" if they have trouble utilizing the technology involved (community members mentioned this specifically for the elderly population) , and if they are without the necessary equipment or Internet bandwidth to participate in a telemedicine visit. \"And even being able to pick up your phone and talk to a healthcare professional who's going to tell you, 'Okay, tell me, what are your symptoms? Do you have a thermometer? Can you take your temperature ?' And you see if this is happening or that is happening, and then they will make a recommendation. And sometimes they're even able to send it to a doctor in your area so that when you go to the doctor, they're pre pared for what's going on with you. \" \"Like my insurance, I do have that, but what about people who don't have health insurance? They have a number I could call and even get the best doctor or ask those type of questions to a nurse, but that's for me because I have health insurance. But if you don't, you're kind of stuck going to the emergency room or going to urgent care. And when I did not have healthcare, I would go to the emergency room if I really needed to. And sometimes I just wasn't believed th at I was either this sick or in this much pain or, 'Oh, go see your primary care .' I don't have a primary care doctor, so you're the doctor I'm coming to see, but you're not believing what I'm saying. So now I'm at a loss. \" Health Resource Availability, continued 61 MENTAL HEALTH RESOU RCE AVAILABILITY The table on page 59 show s the ratio s of Franklin County residents per licensed psychiatrists, psychologists, and chemical counselors. While ratios have decreased (improved) for both chemical counselors and psychologists per resident, the ratio has increased for psychiatrists. The ratio of Franklin County residents per chemical counselor is 919 residents per chemical counselor compared to 1,137 residents in the previous HealthMap . The ratio of residents per psychologist is 2,258 residents per psychologist compared to 2,379 residents in the p revious HealthMap . While this hopefully represents improvements in access for those in need of psychotherapy and chemical counseling for substance abuse issues, residents with more severe mental illness requiring medical treatments and prescription drugs m ay have less access to this than they did in 2019. The ratio of residents per psychiatrists is 7,152:1, compared to 6,836:1 in the previous HealthMap . Community Voices on Mental Health Resource Availability For mental health treatment to be most effective, some community members wan t a counselor who can relate to their experiences. However, this can be hard to find. \"One of the other things that's a challenge is, for me, for example, when my first wife died nine years ago, I went to four counselo rs because I could not find a counselor that shared my lived experience enough to relate to what I was going through. \" \"So for example, in Columbus, specifically Franklin County, there's not many Black male counselors, and if that's something that you're looking for, that limitation contributes to your access. \" \"I understand why people might say, 'I need to find somebody that looks and sounds like me that will help me navigate my issues ,' but that can be a strong barrier. \" Community members are unsure how to seek out he lp when they feel like they need treatment. \"There still is a lack of information on what do if you think you have a substance abuse problem? What do you do if you think you're dealing with severe depression or anxiety or this or that? There's just not a lot of information on what steps to take after that. \" \"There can be an overload of information. Because it's like you're saying how you can go to WebMD, and you can look up certain things ...there's s o much different information out there. It brings you back to the point where if you have some anxiety and depression, and you're looking at all of this information, it's like you're just even more...overwhelmed, confused ...\" Health Resource Availability, continued 62 \"I don't think that people out here would know where to start if they had a mental health issue. Like if they wanted to follow up with that and see a provider, I don't know if they even know where to look, or to reach out to. \" \"I think sometimes if you can't, like physically see th e problem, you don't know when it's time to ask for help and like, look or get help. \" \"Cities and communities need to be working together to educate what you can get help for and what is available now. But when you have eliminated all the aspects of no ed ucation, nobody really working with each other, people pushing you off, and then the healthcare industry treats it as a luxury. You just have people who are suffering and causing suffering. \" EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION The ED data presented in this report are for Franklin County residents who visited any Ohio emergency department and Ohio residents who visited any Ohio emergency department in calendar year 2019. ED utilization can be representative of health resource av ailability due to individuals seeking care from the ED because they lack another known place to receive treatment . This can occur if they do not have a regular health care provider or have additional issues receiving care from another source. While the prevalence of using EDs for this reason is not apparent from current data, the existence of these cases can be inferred somewhat from the data collected on ED case severity, shown in next table . When patients are seen in the ED, they are assigned a \"seve rity\" rating between 1 and 5, with 1 being the least severe and 5 being the most severe. Level 1 health issues are \"self -limited or minor,\" Level 2 issues are of \"low to moderate severity,\" Level 3 issues are of \"moderate severity,\" Level 4 issues are of \" high severity, and require urgent evaluation by the physician but do not pose an immediate threat to life or physiologic function\" and Level 5 issues \"are of high severity and pose an immediate significant threat to life or physiologic function.\" Health Resource Availability, continued 63 Emergency Department Visits10 Franklin County Ohio HM2016 HM2019 HM2022 HM2022 Severity of Emergency Department Visits Level 1 (minor severity) - 10.0 8.0 6.7 Level 2 (low to moderate severity) - 52.8 51.7 43.4 Level 3 (moderate severity) - 161.3 162.0 173.2 Level 4 (high severity, urgent evaluation required) - 142.7 134.9 143.7 Level 5 (high severity, immediate threat to life or function) - 94.1 92.2 104.6 Rate per 1,000 population who were treated and released by emergency departments The total number of ED visits per 1,000 people in Franklin County has decreased since the last HealthMap (608.8 to 511.33 ) and is slightly less than the statewide rate. When breaking down ED visits by those who were treated and released versus those who were admitted into a hospital , the rate of patients who were treated and released decreased since the last HealthMap, while the rate of patients who were admitted into a hospital remained mostly similar. The rate of individuals age 65 and older utilizing emergency department s (both treated and released and admitted into the hospital ) increased since the last HealthMap .

Health Behaviors 67 This section describes some behaviors of Franklin County residents that affect health outcomes, including substance use and behaviors around nutrition and physical activity . Key Findings Nutrition Most Franklin County residents eat vegetables at least once a day, however, over 20% still do not. Substance Use While illicit drug use appears to have decreased in Franklin County, deaths due to overdoses have increased since the last HealthMap. Physical Activity A majority of residents do not engage in enough physical activity to meet national guidelines.

Franklin County: 18.5 %1 Target: 25.4%3 Percent of adults 21 and older who binge drank in the past 30 days Health Behaviors, continued 69 Community Voices on Alcohol Use Community members kn ow about the negative effects of alcohol on overall health and safety, and some have personal experience witnessing people they know dying or losing mobility and the ability to take care of themselves due to alcoholism. The major barriers community members see in terms of decreasing commu nity alcohol abuse and its long -term health effects include a normalized drinking culture and alcohol's function as a cheap replacement to medical care for issues ranging from mental to physical. Community members explained that the popularity of alcohol as a fun pastime along with its visibility in the community can overshadow its dangerous effects . This can also allow alcohol addiction to fly under the radar. \"We have normalized drinking so much that it's a part of our culture. \" \"I think there's probably a pretty big drinking culture in Columbus...you always hear about new bars and stuff opening. I just think about some people I know, like friends, neighbors tha t I have, who, it's a big part of life for a lot of people. And it might be at a point where they could be still getting up for their job every day and they're high functioning, but it's clearly taking -- Either they're drinking too much or it's starting t o take a toll on things...but it's a lot more pervasive maybe behind closed doors that people realize. \" \"Every Kroger's has an actual liquor store. Every Giant Eagle. It's part of your grocery shopping basically, and they put it right in the middle so you have to go by it no matter what. They act like alcohol is not alcohol or something, like it doesn't have an effect on you. It's so normalized. But then if someone is struggling with opioids, oh my God. You know what I mean? \" \"You celebrate, you drink . You're sad, you drink . You're mad, you drink; you want to chill, you drink. \" \"Social media has also glamorized [alcohol] . Like Casamigos has been the drink of the year and summer. \" Community members felt it was common to use alcohol to combat mental issues , and some people may use it in place of medical attention they cannot afford. \"Talking about mental issues, too, a lot of people use alcohol to take care of their mental issues .\" \"[They use alcohol to deal with] depression, anxiety.\" \"I've got friends in my neighborhood who can't afford to get like a root canal done. So they'll be like, 'I'll just drink whiskey until I can't feel it. ' Just using it in place of a lot of times that someone would have used medicine. \" Health Behaviors, continued 70 In Franklin County, trends of illicit drug use are lower than the previous HealthMap , apart from the use of marijuana , which has remained similar . Trends have also decrease d in dependency /abuse of illicit drugs and non-medical use of pain relievers. Illicit Drug Use * Franklin County Ohio USA HM2016 HM2019 HM2022 HM2022 HM2022 Illicit Drug Use 3.0% 2.6% 2.7% 2.9% the general civilian population aged 12 and older . Community Voices on Illicit Drug Use Community members highlighted heroin, fentanyl, meth, opioids, and marijuana in their discussions about illicit substance use , and also expressed concern about overdoses from heroin and other substances . The issues community members raised related to these substances mainly focused on their use as a coping mechanism in stead of mental health care, financial hardships that contribute to the sale of drugs in the community , and the difficulty of ensuring long -term recovery for those in need of treatment for substance issues . Community members mentioned the ability of drugs to make people feel better mentally and emotionally , as a cause of drug use and abuse . Curiosity was also mentioned as a reason for drug use. \"Using more drugs as a means of coping. \" \"They don't really have a support system and it can be a way out. \" \"I see people using [marijuana] in lieu of medicine sometimes. Like in times that you need, say like Zoloft or antianxiety medication, just smoking weed so that I feel more calm, or I feel like there's less going on in my mind .\" \"To address chronic pain, you know, grieving a loss, just don't want to deal with it.\" \"I'm so mad I'm gonna get high so I don't care about it. \" Health Behaviors, continued 71 \"Some just try drugs because they're curious. \" Community members highlighted how financial hardships contribute to the presence of drugs in their community. \"People buying their medication and taking what they need and then selling the rest so they can have more and get it legally, even though they'r e selling it illegally, whether it's ketamine or Percocet, Darvocet, any of that opioid family. \" \"So I do know that in my neighborhood, there's at least one house that we have kind of thought maybe selling drugs from their house. And these people had jobs previously, and now they don't, so unfortunately, I think that's something that they've had to turn to .\" \"Yes, I know there's people selling drugs, drug houses. What do you do when your neighbor stays home all day and sells drugs? What do you do? That's something you see in your communities. Do you report him every month? \" They also see addiction issues firsthand in their communities, and perceive treatment is not happening at the point it should . Community members felt that those in power could make changes to improve treatment and recovery outcomes. \"I see a lot of people that are functioning drug addicts, and I had no idea...And it's normal, and these are hard drugs that can really do a lot of damage, and peopl e are just doing it, going to their six -figure job and coming back home and abusing it. \" \"There is a house in the neighborhood that the emergency squad apparently used to be at less frequently, but this specific person overdoses probably once a week. \" \"Every off ramp and traffic light that has three or four different people with signs about being homeless or a veteran or needing help or whatever. And looking, you know that there's a there's a drug addiction issue that's going on. There's no citywide effo rt...There are things that can be done. It's not compassionate to let addicts live on the streets begging for money all day when there's other ways that other cities have addressed that that we're not necessarily doing here in central Ohio. \" \"There's a lady that I've literally seen ...sleeping in [the street]. During the day she just sits there. And I don't know. She's on something, obviously, but they're also asking policemen to drive by ...I just don't understand how the community can't do better. It doesn't se em like the police cares. It's just like they just drive by and go, 'Well, that's normal .' \" \"Affordable housing [matters] . I was thinking more so like homelessness, and the people that are in the street, and then that's all they are is in the street. So they're going to meet those people that are in the street. \" Health Behaviors, continued 72 Community members disagreed about the amount of recovery options available but agreed that recovery is difficult if there is not attention to the underlying issues contributing to drug use and relearning healthy coping mechanisms. \"So you start doing drugs, how do you stop. What are the options now, there's so few recovery options.\" \"A lot of these facilities are not doing well, and they're not really getting great results so far with peo ple that have been struggling with addiction their whole life, like they go to these things are so underfunded, they are they barely get the attention they need, and then they're back out.\" \"There's not a lack of recovery options, but you have to make you rself clean. I can't make you get no cleaner than what you want to be. If you come back out and use drugs it's because you wanted to.\" \"Whatever you're trying to not face by drowning into any kind of substance, you are going to have to face it, and if you want to correct it, you have to face it. So if you keep denying that that thing is happening to you, then you will not find the solution because you don't want to face it.\" \"Like we were talking about, what options are there for you for help? That are really going to help, are you really going to be able to unlearn bad habits or unhealthy behavior and be taught other coping mechanisms?\" YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE Thus far, the statistics for alcohol, tobacco, and other substance use presented in HealthMap2022 have focused on Franklin County adults. Unfortunately, recent and reliable data are unavailable for these types of health behaviors among Franklin County youth. To provide a possible view into the prevalence of these health behaviors among Franklin County' s high schoolers, the infographic shown on the next page presents Ohio -level information from its 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Health Behaviors, continued 73 Tobacco Use8 Among Ohio High School Students (2019) Measure Statistic Racial/ethnic differences?

This means that out of 100,000 Franklin County residents, over 40 die each year due to drugs or medication. This is higher than the rate in the state of Ohio (36. 4), which had a similar rate of deaths since the last HealthMap (36.8). Health Behaviors, continued 74 The recent increase in overdose deaths in Franklin County from fentanyl mirro rs statewide patterns. In 20 20, the opioid overdose antidote drug Narcan was administered 6,239 times in Franklin County. Franklin County deaths due to Opiates, Cocaine, and Alcohol also increased since the previous HealthMap . Rates of death due to Heroin and Benzodiazepines decreased during this same time period.

Community Voices on Substance Abuse For all types of substance use, the financial impacts are profound, and addiction can set off and contribute to a cycle of poverty. \"I definitely think financial ramifications of any type of substance abuse is one of the biggest issues. If you're abusing alcohol, if you're abusing marijuana or pills or whatever the substance is, a lot of your financial resources go towards that, which causes you not to be able to sustain your home, which cause s you not to buy your groceries, which in turn, you're losing your kids. \" \"People's lives have been turned upside down because they smoke too much marijuana. They spend their whole check in a day, but that comes down to Health Behaviors, continued 75 abuse because, on the other hand, m arijuana can help someone who does not have an appetite, who can't eat, or someone who is going through chemotherapy or whatever it may be. But I do agree with what she said, it's been normalized, like the abuse of it and how much money people do spend on it because I have seen people who will spend their whole check on it. And they're fine because they're smoking it until it's gone. And now they're like, 'I have no money .' I think they do go hand in hand. \" Community members expressed concern about how substance use in genera l impacts younger generations exposed to it through their elders. \"If their kid comes in and sees them. And it normalizes it for that, and they think it's okay. \"It's always going to go back to the kids for me. Substance abuse, I think it may be like the number two reason that kids are in the system, doesn't have a parent or a guardian. It's like the family that also causes trauma for those kids. Then they have to figure out how to cope with that trauma. And the way they know to cope with the trauma is what they've seen, and that's drugs and alcohol. So it's like thi s vicious cycle, but I think the biggest consequence is how it affects families, specifically kids .\" Community members also expressed concern that substance use and abuse increased due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Many community members commented that eithe r boredom from socialization decreasing, or worsened mental health brought on by isolation and increased stress led to more frequent substance use, from alcohol to drugs. Health Behaviors, continued 76 Nutrition Over 40% of Franklin County residents eat fruit less than one time per day, similar to rates in the previous HealthMap . The percentage of residents eating vegetables less than once per day remains over 20%, also similar to the previous HealthMap . Fruit and Ve getable HM2016 HM2019 HM2022 HM2022 HM2022 Consumed fruit day 40.9% 45.2% 43.7% 42.7% 39.3% Consumed vegetables day 26.1% 24.3% 22.1% 20.2% 20.3% Community Voices on Nutrition When asked about nutritional issues, community members spoke to numerous barriers affecting individual s' abilities to develop and/or maintain healthy eating habits. These issues can be collapsed into two broad categories : the availability of healthy foods in the community ; and individuals' willingness to eat healthy foods . However, t hese are not discrete issues , as the difficulty in sourcing and preparing healthy foods is seen to contribute to preferences for fast food or \"easier,\" unhealthy options. Youth suffer the nutritional consequences of these issues along with their parents or guardians. Community members stated that having access to grocery stores is essential to eating healthy . By contrast, corner stores often don't have nutritious foods, and restaurants cannot guarantee this at an affordable price . \"If you go to one of the corner stores, they might have it in the back, but you don't want it because you don't know how long it's been in there. If you're not in the grocery store, you're not going to find [fruits and vegetables].\" \"There's nowhere around me. I live in an area with tons of restaurants, tons of cafes. I try hard. T here's nowhere for me to go to get a healthy meal that doesn't require hours of planning, cooking, and grocery shopping. Or that's not like $20 for a lettuce wrap.\" However, grocery stores are not accessible enough, particularly in low -income neighborhoods. Healthy fast -food options are not common enough either. Health Behaviors, continued 77 \"It's a mile and a half to get to the closest grocery store by my house. But you can get the five different conven ience marts or, you know, four or five different fast food places within walking and biking distance ...If you've got somebody who doesn't have a vehicle, you know, and the temperature is hot, they can't get necessarily to the grocery store, but you know, the y could walk to the corner store and get frozen pizza or a bag of chips a whole lot easier. \" \"The accessibility [to grocery stores] is not equitable. It's not something that is offered. It's not something that is encouraged in certain neighborhoods. \" \"As well as you can tell the difference of the neighborhood that you're in by your fast-food restaurants. There's not a lot of healthy fast -food options. in certain neighborhoods. You have to drive other places to get a good vegetarian meal or to get to other meals other than chicken. \" Community members also mentioned access to the grocery store is an issue for the elderly population. One comment spoke about this in the context of COVID -19, where relying on other people for help grocery shopping became difficult. However, this lack of access may extend in general to this population and others with less mobility. The food in grocery stores is also not guaranteed to be fresh and available when people need it . Some travel farther than the ir closest grocery to find the produce they need. The poor shelf life of produce found at some stores can also make people feel like they are wasting their money. \"I'll drive to a grocery store farther from my house just to get the vegetables and fruit that I want because they don't even carry them at the grocery store.\" \"And then it's not fresh, and there's n o diversity. I don't want to go to my local Kroger because they have only a set amount of produce, and then that produce is not even fresh, so I have to travel farther.\" \"The thing is, food don't last as long anymore. You go to a grocery store...In two days, you're about to cook, and it's spoiled. And that's why people rather go out or order out because it's like wasting money on the grocery store, or you feel like it's a waste.\" People also questioned the \"health\" of different packaged foods or produce they buy from the grocery store. Concerns about false labeling and genetic modification frustrated some community members. \"About the food, we don't know what we're eating these days. I bought salad or lettuce the other day. And when I went home and I opened up the package, it felt like plastic. I'm like, we don't know what we're consuming. It says organic ...and we think we're buying organic but we're really not. It's trash.\" Health Behaviors, continued 78 \"And going back to what you said about greed, just the GMO, that's all about it. So they push that food overseas. They all say no, so they give it to us. So we're the ones that kind of keep all that food that's been modified. It's definitely not healthy.\" \"I also think in the packaged foods, there's kind of sugar in everything, and so even if something's not a sugary food, there's sugar snuck into it. And that all adds up to this load of sugar that people are consuming maybe not even knowing.\" Community members discussed alternative sources to the grocery store, inc luding community gardens and farmer's markets. However , some participants expressed that the community discussion was the first time they had heard of these food sources in the community. Community gardens and farmer's markets may be unknown to a large por tion of a neighborhood's population and have other barriers to utilization. Community members said when it comes to preparing healthy food, not everyone has knowledge in cooking and nutrition to do this effectively . \"I think there's just like a broad lack of education about what the nutrition is for people. I never learned in school or from my parent s the macronutrients you should be eating or how to cook for yourself, how to source these things. It's certainly not taught in school that I'm aware of.\" \"So you get young adults out on their own, and if you can't cook, you don't know how to make a pot of rice, some simple things. You don't come out of the womb knowing how to do that, but if you weren't taught...\" \"Even if you did have it, there's a lack of knowledge on how to prepare it. You could have a whole bunch of fresh produce and you're like, 'I don't know what to do with it .' So then you're stuck going to a fast -food restaurant or some other restaurant that may have it on their menu, and then they're selling at a higher price when we ourselves don't even know how to cook it.\" Eating healthy by sourcing and preparing nutritious food takes effort and is work . After their actual job, people take advantage of efficient fast -food options that allow them to rest. Media may also play a role in drawing people away from cooking at home. \"Another thing is that we want everythi ng right now, too. People don't want to take the time to prepare a nice wholesome meal. You just want to get something real quick. You've had a long day at work. Let's just order out.\" \"Like we're rewarded for grinding, so to speak. For constantly being moving 40/50/60/70/80 hours a week...The last thing you want to do is go home and fix anything that takes more than 20 minutes, you know. So that means that you're eating out of a vending machine. You're ordering out of a drive thru.\" Health Behaviors, continued 79 \"Ever y time we turn the TV on whatever, we're trying to work out, we have the issue where everything's like 4 for 4 so everything is so easy for people to stop making food at home and it's healthier. The fast -food option is being pushed in our faces too much.\" Speaking to youth nutrition, community members emphasized that children are not taught how to practice healthy eating habits at home or at school. Media directed to kids involving fast food may also make this lesson more difficult to ingrain. If left unchecked these issues contribute to obesity and malnourishment that lead to larger health issues. \"I think it's such a cycle, too in families. If they were brought up being like 'fast food for dinner ,' they're most likely to do that with their kid s.\" \"Also, working in a school, the food they're feeding them is not good. The breakfast they're getting is like a cinnamon roll, not healthy breakfast options. I don't know. I feel like that needs to change.\" \"Food can definitely be a barrier, especially when you have young children and you're trying to teach them how to eat properly, and they see McDonalds and happy meal places and Barbie 'works ' at Starbucks.\" \"Obesity, but malnutrition. So a kid could be m orbidly obese on Twinkies. And so like vitamin, nutrient deficiency and how that affects their teeth, their vision, their hair falling out, like their attention, their ability to stay alert, or to sleep or not sleep.\" To improve youth nutritional outcomes, community members pointed to example s set by other countries and other solutions to teach children about healthy foods. \"[In Canada] they're invested heavily in educating the parents to give healthy food to their kids just so people will be healthy and the cost of healthcare doesn't rise. So it would be nice to have something similar. I don't know if I'm going to be alive when it happens...t here was absolutely no candy at schools, a no candy policy. So we learned at an early age to demand those healthy habits, eating fruits and vegetables. \" \"It would really be nice to find those farmers and get food to the schools and have some people volunteer to help chefs set up a menu that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, but yet has all the nu trients that the kids need. It might not be very expensive, but put some help from volunteers or be able to come up with some menus that are healthy for kids .\" \"I used to work at a school, and one of the teachers actually took it upon himself to create a garden at the school. He had a garden club and taught the kids how to grow fruits and vegetables that they could eat for healthier options, but also grew stuff that could be served at the school for breakfast and lunch. \" Health Behaviors, continued 80 Physical Activity Under one quarter of Franklin County residents meet aerobic and strength guidelines (22% ). According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, adults who meet these guidelines engage in at least 1.25 hours of vigorous -intensity exercis e or 2.5 hours of moderate -intensity exercise weekly and muscle strengthening exercises at least twice a week .14 In Franklin County and Ohio, y outh aged 18 -24 have the highest percentage of individuals meeting these guidelines . Similarly in both Franklin County and Ohio, the percentage of individuals meeting the guidelines tends to increase as household income and educational attainment increase. Meets Physical Activity Guidelines13 Franklin County Ohio Franklin County Ohio HM2022 HM2022 school - 11.0% Black, -Hispanic 20.6% 21.3% HS diploma or 18.6% Some college 26.3% -Hispanic - 28.7% College graduate 27.0% 26.7% Multi - racial - 30.6% Community Voices on Physical Activity The major barriers community members see when it comes to getting adequate amounts of physical activity are cost and relatedly, the awareness of low -cost activities in their communities. For adults, physical activity comes second to their jobs, and exhaustion after Health Behaviors, continued 81 the workday can be a barrier to pursuing additional physical activity. For youth under 18 , community members repeatedly mentioned the emphasis of technology on health behaviors and habits a round physical activity . They also perceived a lack of community centers , like Boys and Girls Clubs , centered around youth activities at low costs for parents. Community members explained that physical gym memberships and loca l recreational activities can be cost prohibitive . Those with little money to spend to go somewhere for activity may be unaware of discounted opportunities for activities in the area, and community members perceived a lack of advertising for this. \"Gym memberships are expensive. If you want to join a gym - Well, some of them aren't expensive, I guess, but a lot of them are expensive. \" \"More community centers...that would be like on a sliding scale. I think they don't advertise it maybe purposely. But then that kind of hindering a lot of people who don't have the funds to do stuff like that.\" \"I also think there's a lot of information at the city don't necessarily put out that's available out there. For lower income neighborhoods, like y ou can get a family pass to go to the Franklin Park Conservatory for like 40 or 50 bucks. People don't know that. \" \"Some of those places are even free right now. If you are at a library closest to like Franklin Park, there's like a limited amount of passe s for seven days for your whole family for free... So though the conservatory isn't necessarily like physical fitness, right? But it's just getting you up and moving in the city and there is a park there , playground , and you could walk the grounds and get some exercise so there are options they just don't always advertise. \" Community members also perceived an overemphasis on paid recreational activities , while people may not take advantage of the free opportunities, like parks, at their disposal . Transportation issues and having multiple children could make the necessary trips to community assets harder. Feeling unsafe going to a trail or park by yourself was also mentioned by a community memb er. Those who are employed may prioritize rest during their time off from work , leaving them little time and energy to exercise in between other responsibilities. \"A lot of people don't have time to work out because after work, especially with my husband. He gets so drained mentally at work that, when he comes home, he just wants to lay down. Because when you come home, you've dealt with so many things at work . \" \"A lot of people are at their jobs more than they're at home or you could have a physical job. And the two days that they give you off, you're like more trying to calm down from those days than you are doing something. \" Health Behaviors, continued 82 Community members mentioned the impact of technology on promoting sedentary lifestyles in general , but especially for youth. Community members perceive children not to be active, because they rarely see them playing outside. Instead, the children they know seem to spend a disproportionate amount of time online . \"She mentioned something about just the health starting with our kids, with the youth. What I also feel is a huge issue for overall health, physical, emotional, social health, is the fact that our kids are not active. \" \"They're drawn to social media. They don't go outside and play anymore. It's rare that I see children playing, so they're not getting the exercise. \" \"I think we do a good job in Central Ohio of having those outdoor resources, but how much kids actually utilize them, I think, is just really low. And I do think the screen time thing is a huge contributor to that .\" \"I was just amazed by how hard it was to get [my friend's son] away from his iPad. I was like, 'Let's go jump on the trampol ine. Let's go for a bike ride .' And it was like I had to pull him out the door to do those things because he just wanted to be with his iPad. \" \"My nephews are in the house, playing video games .\" \"They're using it [the internet] more, and the more other kids don't play outside, it just dwindles the number down and down because you have less people to play with. So if only one person out of 10 will go outside and play with you, you're probably not going to ask as much. \" Community members perceive a lack of low -cost after school activities for children that include different types of physical activity. \"Growing up, they had Boys and Girls Club on every corner, and that was your after -school program, and you learned how to play a variety of sports. It was structured...there really aren't those types of resources for kids to go to unless you're willing to pay for it, and that was just a free program that was available ...and I found out that I love field hockey that way, and I never would have played that without that... I feel like the only one I know of is Milo Grogan, and that's not necessarily close .\" \"In Canada, we had a community center where everyone knew each other, like if everyone came from the same family and a lot of different activities like speed skating. They would bring up someone to teach them how to fish, all kinds of activities that my children have been exposed to when we were there, and now that I don't have it, I find it so valuable. \" \"I know that the parks and recs, they have their programs, too, but again, that's also pay for each little thing ...So I think like those types of community resources to keep kids active and give them exposure to things that they're interested in outside of the typical footba ll, basketball, baseball, swimming. \" Health Behaviors, continued 83 References 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data , 2019 (HM2022), 2018 (HM2022: e -cigarette and chew tobacco users), 2016 (HM2019), 2013 (HM2016) . 2 Ohio Department of Public Safety Crash Statistics System , Alcohol, Drug, & Fatal Stat istics Report (Franklin County and Ohio), 201 9 (HM2022), 2016 (HM2019) . https://ohtrafficdata.dps.ohio.gov/crashstatistics/home 3 Healthy People 2030 objective SU -10, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 4 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, National Survey on Drug Use and Health (Franklin County), Average of 2018 and 2019 (HM2022), Average of 2011, 2013, and 2014 (HM2019), Average of 2010, 2011, and 2012 (HM2016) 5 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, National Survey on Drug Use and Health (Ohio and United States), Average of 2016, 2017, and 2018 (HM2022), Average of 2015 and 2016 (HM2019), Average of 2013 and 2014 (HM2016) 6 Substan ce Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, National Survey on Drug Use and Health Small Area Estimates (Franklin County), 201 6-2018 (HM2022), 2012 -2014 (HM2019), 2010 -2012 (HM2016) 7 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, National Survey on Drug Use and Health (Ohio and United States), Average of 2018 and 2019 (HM 2022); Average of 2015 and 2016 (HM2019), Average of 20 13 and 2014 (HM2016) 8 Ohio Department of Health, High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey Tobacco and Electronic Vapor Product Use Report, 2019 9 Ohio Department of Health, High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey Substance Use Report, 2019 10 Ohio Emergency Medical Services, Naloxone Administration by Ohio EMS Providers By County, Ohio, 2020 (HM2022), 2017 (HM2019), 2013 (HM2016) 11 Ohio Department of Health, Resident Mortality Data (Franklin County and Ohio), 2019 (HM2022), 2016 (HM2019), 2012 (HM2016); Centers for Di sease Control and Prevention, WISQARS Fatal Injury Data (United States), 2019 (HM2022), 2016 (HM2019), 2012 (HM2016) 12 Ohio Department of Health, Resident Mortality Data (Franklin County and Ohio), 2019 (HM2022), 2016 (HM2019), 2013 (HM2016); National Instit ute on Drug Abuse, Overdose Death Rates (United States), 2019 (HM2022), 2015 (HM2019), 2013 (HM2016) 13 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data, 2019 (HM2022), 2015 (HM2019), 2013 (HM2016) Health Behaviors, continued 84 14 U.S. Depart ment of Health and Human Services.

Maternal and Infant Health 85 Health i ssues facing mothers and their newborn children in Franklin County are described in this section . Key Findings In Franklin County, 127 infants died before their first birthday in 201 9. Overall, the infant mortality rate has decreased since the last HealthMap . However, this rate remains higher than the national rate. The infant mortality rate among infants who are Black has decreased since the last HealthMap (from 15.2 to 11.4 per 1,000 live births ) but remains cons iderably higher than infants who are White (4.3 per 1,000 live births ).

Infant Mortality While infant mortality has decreased since the last HealthMap , the rate remains above the national goal . Rates of infant mortality among Black infants remain significantly higher than other racial and ethnic groups. Maternal Health Lower rates of adolescent pregnancies occur at present compared to the previous HealthMap . Many maternal health outcomes and behavi ors have not improved , with higher percentages of pregnant mothers diagnosed with diabetes, engaging in substance use while pregnant, and without health insurance. Maternal and Infant Health, continued 86 As additional context, research by Celebrate One ( a community -wide, collaborative initiative created to reduce the Franklin County infant mortality rate while also cutting in half the racial disparity with this issue ) found that the infant mortality rates for both non -Hispanic White infants and non -Hispanic Black infants are substantially higher in certain Franklin County zip codes .3 For example, while the overall infant mortality rate in Frankin County was 6.9 in 2019, it was 50% greater (10.5) in the 13 zip codes shown in the figure below . Those zip codes correspond to Celebrate One's priority areas and tend to be those that historically have experienced high levels of poverty and low levels of outside investment. Franklin County's Priority Areas for Infant Mortality Prevention Efforts3 Franklin County: 6.91 Target: 5.02 Infant mortality rate Maternal and Infant Health, continued 87 Community Voices on Infant Health Community members are concerned about infant mortality, and especially those causes that are avoidabl e - due to parental behaviors and lack of resources or health care. \"Our infant mortality is through the roof. Like worse in the state of Ohio, worse than some third world countries. \" \"Not making it to their first birthday for whatever reason, and it's nine times eight times out of 10 it's not because they have a medical issue. \" \"I know some pe ople that are like I'm just gonna like take a little nap with my baby right next to me. Which, like you're not supposed to do at all, or all of these things have some of think are not a big deal. And then something really terrible happen that you're not ma king into their first birthday. \" \"If you don't have enough diapers for your baby that comes through, like if they have diarrhea that can turn into a yeast infection to an open skin wound. And you can become septic, it can go very quickly . Baby boys who are circumcised and don't get proper care of the area that can get infected and lead to terrible outcomes. \" \"Especially for African Americans. You just don't get the same attention and care. It's crazy to me that this is our reality. \" Black and African American community members said breastfeeding is not standard enough in their communities . Misconceptions may be present about the health value of bottle feeding compared to breastfeeding. \"Things like breastfeeding, you may not have had that experience, have friends or a family member or a sister [who breastfed their children]. As a young mother, that's di fficult . There are programs and there are ones in our community, but maybe there's not enough communication or outreach. \" \"I feel like, in my community, the doctors are pushing for people to bottle feed their babies. I knew better than to do that, but they pushed for that. And I don't know if they did it in another community ...\" Maternal and Infant Health, continued 88 In Franklin County , the rates of estimated pregnancies and live births among adolescents decreased for most age groups . However, Franklin County's rate of adolescent pregnancy and live births is higher than the state and national rates for those aged 15 -17.

The rate of babies hospitalized with neonatal abstinence syndrome, a result of mothers using drugs during pregnancy, is 12.9 out of every 1,000 live births in Franklin County, a rate similar to Ohio overall (12.5).

Before becoming pregnant, 5.8% of women in Franklin County had been diagnosed with diabetes , which is an increase from the last HealthMap . About half of women in Franklin County and Ohio overall were not taking multi -vitamins, pre -natal vitamins, or folic acid the month before becoming pregnant. In Franklin County and Ohio , about one -quarter of pregnancies were unintended, meaning these women did not want to get pregnant or wanted to get pregnant later.

Prenatal Health Franklin County Ohio HM2016 HM2019 HM2022 Health Drank 32.3% 30.8% Community Voices on Materna l Health Indicators Community members commented on maternal health indicators including substance use, lack of prenatal care, and some specific health conditions . After childbirth , community members pointed to postpartum depression and lack of support for mothers as important health issues. The COVID -19 pandemic also contributed to a lower level of maternal support throughout pregnancy . Community members felt that substance use while pregnant is not taken seriously by some members of their community. \"A lot of your younger people, they do drugs. And of course, this is going to affect newborns. \" \"Pregnant woman not caring about chain smoking cigarettes even though I'm pregnant. And then the baby suffers because of that. \" \"Marijuana is a big one...I think the legalization of marijuana has made pregnant women feel a little more okay with smoking while they're pregnant. They'll smoke up into a certain month, and then they'll stop. \" \"Mental issues because of their parents are drinking alcohol. \" Pregnant mothers may also put off or have barriers to prenatal care . \"But during the COVID time, many of the pregnant mothers were not able to visit theirs doctors in timely fashions, and they didn't know the position of the baby sometimes. And the delivery had been very complicated, and they did not get the sufficient prenatal and even the postnatal care also.\" Maternal and Infant Health, continued 91 \"Lack of prenatal care. I'm noticing a lot of mothers are not going to the doctors right away. They're several months in before they'll even schedule their first doctor's appointment.\" \"There's not a lot of clinics anymore for reproductive health for women. That is something that we didn't talk about as far as a healthy community, having a women's health clinic or reproductive health clinic. That's important to have. I mean, I drive all the way up to Westerville for mine just be cause she gave me so much personalized attention that I will never go to another doctor. \" \"That was my first positive experience in a long time with a doctor going for reproductive health, and I don't think people are going to their prenatal appointments. \" Community members pointed out a few physical health issues they knew impacted maternal and infant health. \"People are not recognizing that Endometriosis is a huge issue right now. I know probably five women who have lost their babies recently. They were pregnant, and then they just lost them. So miscarriage is crazy right now in my community .\" \"Preeclampsia is like an epidemic, especially for Black women. \" Postpartum depression was regarded as a common issue in many Franklin County communities. \"There's been an increase, I think, in postpartum depression because they don't get as much help as maybe they would have. \" \"I feel like also a lot of people in the community that deal with postpartum depression without really being properly diagnosed with that, and it turns into mental health issues. And because of how you're perceived by your community, you don't want to address the issues and go and get help. That also can be an issue. \" \"And we can go down another whole other rabbit hole about Black wom en and pregnancy and postpartum how that's just not treated. \" \"I have a friend who's going through postpartum depression right now, and I have a niece that did the same thing when she was. And that's a rough thing to go through. It's hard on the child. It's hard on the mother. \" Community members also pointed out that some maternity leave practices do not provide mothers with adequate support post -birth. \"And related to maternal health, I mean, our s is a joke. As far as like the time you get off, you know, other countries are doing it right like giving them and their partner leave, like six months, or a year, or even three months. \" Maternal and Infant Health, continued 92 \"They only gave my husband a week off of work. And like one week is nothing, I wouldn't even barely be out of bed in a week. Like that doesn't help. On top of that we got two kids at home already. So it's like, I think it's the double standard that the men don't have to be there as much as the w oman. But really, we fall back on our husbands when we're down. \" COVID -19 increased maternal anxiety and stress during pregnancy, as mothers faced restrictions on bringing support persons to appointments and socializing. \"I mean anxiety. Especially throughout all of it just like being pregnant and having a baby, all within a pandemic. Maybe your partner doesn't come to an appointment with you because they're not allowed. You can't have any kind of support person. \" \"So it makes you feel alone in your pregnancy. Sometimes you're like, I got to go through all this by myself. And then the doctors only care so much. Yeah, they only see a little bit and you get in your head sometimes. So it's very hard, especially in a pandemic. \" \"Any ne ws that you get that's not good news, you're used to or want to have somebody with you. So that is anxiety inducing. Anybody knows stress and anxiety is terrible for someone who's pregnant. \" \"It's a little harder when you weren't able to have a baby shower or you weren't able to have the social supports to then bring your baby into the world and be mentally healthy afterwards. \" COVID -19 also made it more difficult for mothers to receive th e education and resources customarily provided during pregnan cy. \"So like childbirth, education, newborn classes, those have been canceled completely. Or you are doing your hospital tours online. And that's not why you signed up for a tour. You want to see it and like feel it right. You don't want to like see it on camera. So all of that plays into what that experience is going to be like, right? \" Maternal and Infant Health, continued 93 References 1 Ohio Department of Health, Public Health Data Warehouse (Franklin County and Ohio), 2019 (HM2022), (Franklin County), 2016 (HM2019); National Vital Statistics Report, 69(7) (United States), 2018 (HM2022); Ohio Department of Health, Infant Mortality Data (Ohio), 2016 (HM2019); National Kids Count Data Center (United States), 2015 (HM2019), 2011 (HM2016); Ohio Department of Health, Vital Statistics (Franklin County and Ohio), 2012 (HM2016) 2 Healthy People 2030 Objective MICH -02, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 3 Celebrate One , Data Dashboard January - March, 2021 4 Ohio Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics (Franklin County and Ohio), 201 8 (HM2022); Guttmacher Institute, Pregnancies, Births and Abortions in the United States, 1973 -2017: National and State Trends by Age (United States), 201 7 (HM2022); Ohio Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics Teen Pregnancy Report (Franklin County and Ohio) 2016 (HM2019); Ohio Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics Teen Pregnancy Report (Franklin County and Ohio) Teen Pregnancy Report 20 13 (HM2016) 5 Ohio Department of Health, Public Health Data Warehouse (Franklin County), 2019 (HM2022), 2016 (HM2019) , 2013 (HM2016) ; Hamilton BE, Rossen L, Lu L, Chong Y.

Key Findings Just under a quarter of Franklin County adult residents have been told they have a form of depression .

Community members point t o the amount of negativity people are exposed to in their communities and via media sources , lack of adequate emotional support for youth and adults , and the wide - ranging effects of the COVID -19 pandemic as contributors to poor mental health. Mental and Social Health, continued 96 Community Voices on Adult Mental Health Issues Community members were very concerned about the mental health issues of anxiety and depression . They spoke to the various contributors to poor mental health as well as what should be done to mitigate these issues and the barriers to doing so. Community members were most concerned with how anxiety and depression cause suicidal ideation and actions. \"The attempts or the thoughts [of suicide] is what is prevalent, not the actual action, but that's just as bad, if you ask me, to deal day to day w ith feelings like that. \" \"Anxiety is a killer also. Anxiety can drive you to suicide as easily as depression can.\" \"I guess I can only really speak to the age groups I interact closely with, millennials probably 25 to 40. And I personally have known seve ral people who have been victims of suicide and many more who have had those sorts of thoughts without expressing them very openly. \" \"People kill ing themselves and loved ones .\" As a cause of poor mental health, community members pointed to the amount of negativity people are exposed to , from tension and violence they see in their communities, to that which they see happening through social media. \"I think something that hasn't been said, but we get a little anxiety about the gun violence and j ust in general, how many people are dying from violence in the community. We live downtown, so it's going to happen, but even Chicago, like 54 people were shot this weekend. It's got me a little bit more worked up recently. Columbus is like the record year .\" . Franklin County: 13.53 Target: 12.85 Suicide rate Mental and Social Health, continued 97 \"Nearly every day I get a notification about [gun violence]. That just happened a while ago. I mean, it happens everywhere. It's just worrisome. That's just something I've been worried about community -wise.\" \"I just think a lot of stresses, a lot of people have that in neighborhoods because they're afraid to get out. And that isn't good for your health at all, when you're afraid to get out in your community.\" \"I would also say more exposure through social media or the news, just everything going on, whether it's COVID or all the things going around in the world, whether it's wildfires or unrest...I think that we just have a lot more exposure than we did prior to, say, the internet as far as what's going on. I think people can go down a spiral.\" \"Increase in hate.\" \"There has been a lot of racial tension. \" Support from other people encourages good mental health outcomes, and not having this support can contribute to poor mental health or make existing issues worse. \"Not having that support, I mean, I raised two sons. I'm grateful my sons are grown men now. But I can imagine having babies right now. I had so much support that I could take a mental health break by sending my kids to my friend's house, and then we would swap. I would k eep hers or send them to my mother, my parents' home. But people just don't have that now. It seems like, you know, either, you know, some people are not fit, or they're just not accessible or not willing. But it's like moms are like, mom and/or dads are j ust like out on their own now.\" \"Before COVID, I remember reading an article about aging and how when a person gets older, the less they experience the human touch. People don't touch them much. People avoid them.\" \"I was active duty military, so I've se en a ton of people that had mental health issues, and they wouldn't go seek attention, and it could just turn out for the worse.\" Community members also spoke about how negative valuations of self -worth impact poor mental health outcomes. \"As a society, we struggle with knowing self -worth and self -value...Everybody struggles with that because we have media telling us this is what you need to be, this is what you need to look like, this is the way you need to dress, this is the neighborhood you ne ed to live in, this is how much you need to make, et cetera.\" Mental and Social Health, continued 98 \"I know one person that committed suicide in the community ...a lot of times it's right in the home. The family may cause someone to want to commit suicide. I know the guy that killed himself, it was because his family, his wife, cheated on him. He found out and he just couldn't take it ...\" Community members noted how COVID -19 contributed to poor mental health outcomes by hindering typical modes of receiving social support . \"I think a lot in the past year, we haven't been able to socialize as much, and some people do need that social outlet. So it's harder to make meaningful connections and talk about things you're go ing through because you're at home by yourself. \" \"And you've got this combination of people staying home, already disconnected maybe from their in -person workplace. They're also experiencing this extreme political divisiveness over the ongoing pandemic and everything. \" \"You can't even get your nieces, nephews, sons and daughters, grandchildren, you can't even get their affection, and so the void becomes bigger. \" \"When you talk physically, people were really separated, and we could not get to know each other and the celebration, the events, that we used to have, you know. Generally, we were totally isolated on that part. And you deal with people who started experiencing some kind of, you know, anxiety and depression. \" COVID -19 also made people feel powerless as they struggled to adjust to changes to their lives . \"I think we're trying to process all the changes that have come our way, quickly and often its difficult. Or, you know, just mentioned families earlier, whether regardless of your family structure, you've had to adjust your life in some way, shape, or form. \" \"People don't feel they have control anymore. Their control was taken away. Kind of like a powerless thing, because we were told we had to stay and we had to wear a mask. You have to do this, or you should. There's pressure about the vaccine. There's pressure now for the children. All kind of pressure. \" \"There were a lot of contributions in regard to job loss and loss of members of their family who they lost due to COVID or due to other things .\" \"And that's obviously something I think my generation at least have never experienced before. So to be able to be told absolutely no to traveling or doing anything really that you wanted to do prior was a pretty sober ing experience that this is the world we could live in... \" Mental and Social Health, continued 99 Community members pointed to the experiences of workers that suffered heightened pressure and stress during COVID -19 due to the nature of their positions. \"I think it definitely contributed to the mental health issues because I know that there were teachers that I was pulling out of dark places who just were very frustrated with the public learning platform that we were using. And so it was very challenging for them to try to grad e the students and have to try to prepare them for the testing, which they thought was ridiculous that they had to take. \" \"I think we talk about young people when it comes to suicide ...but a lot of people are dealing with a lot of issues to the point where they just want to end it. And we need special support for everyone, not just certain age groups. Parents are dealing with that. Teachers are dealing with that. Health care workers are dealing with that .\" \"A lot of people around me work in the servic e industry. And a lot of them are actually have been working through this whole thing... So that's a whole other level of anxiety that they are having to deal with that ...having to go through all the scary, scary information that was going on at the very begi nning and not knowing just how communicable it was ...There's a couple of nurses that live in my building that it impacted them pretty severely .\" Community members also commented how financial concerns during the COVID -19 pandemic increased feelings of stress and anxiety. YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH Because the number of youth suicides (e.g., among those age 15 -24) was so low in recent years , a rate cannot be calculated for this. This in itself suggest s an improvement in this indicator from the last HealthMap (12.8 per 100,000 of the population) .6 Community Voices on Youth Mental Health Issues Concerns about youth suicide and suicidal ideation were common among community members. \"I'm an educator, and I had a lot of students who had come to my office and who would talk to me about having suicidal thoughts and struggling with suicide a lot this past year and talking about how their parents were unable to help them. \" \"I have a 17 -year -old in high school who lost two people in his school to suicide within the last two years that he knows. That's something that they wanted to resort to. That's something that they talk about as an option to deal with their teenager concerns .\" \"I think having more available health resources in school...But that would be really helpful because those people are trained to recognize those signs. Kids Mental and Social Health, continued 100 are at school for eight hours a day, and there might be that time when somebody catches somebody and could save a kid's life. A lot of the social media and the lack of activities contributes to depression and anxiety, and kids don't know what really that is or how to deal with it, but if they can get help early enough, it could possibly prevent them f rom having suicidal thoughts or attempting suicide .\" \"I think our young people are going through so much pressure to be perfect, to be the best, to be famous, to be the breadwinner sometimes. And so I do think that our young in Reynoldsburg actually are f acing issues with suicide, suicidal attempts, and mental health issues that have suicide ideations. Over the summer, I did get a couple of emails from the school district saying that we lost a couple of kids over the summer. \" While adult residents mentioned pressure to be perfect, social media, and bullying as contributors to poor mental health for youth , these conversations lacked more specific insight from youth about contributors to suicidal ideation. Community members were also concerned with youth \"raising themselves\" due to parents unwilling or unable to consistently care for them. \"Got a lot of young parents today, so these kids is raising themselves a lot of times. Parents out there partying, on Facebook, and doing lives. And kids is doing whatever they want to do. Then they want to blame them when the teacher call saying such and such is having issues in school. You got to look at the parent. \" \"The parents aren't taking care of them. They're not having somebody check on them or stay with them while they're out partying. So like he said before, they're raising themselves. \" \"Yeah, a lot of kids are having to grow too fast. Again, become the support system for their siblings and it's hard because t he parents are going back to work now. did a lot of stuff is still not opening. So it was like a 13 year old has to become a 20 year old overnight to take care of the family while the parents are out doing what they have to do. \" \"And then also like someth ing affecting kids 18 and younger is just like, like they're home alone, you know, like so their parents can't be home. They can't afford latchkey. You know, the 13-year -old walks with a six-year -old home and they just fend for themselves. And there's not necessarily anything wrong with it. But that social emotional component is important too, which leads into all kinds of issues. \" Along with concern about parents being present to provide physical and emotional support for their children, community members also mentioned parental stress contributing to poor parenting , and children modeling negative behaviors of their parents when it comes to substance use. Mental and Social Health, continued 101 COVID -19 affected mental health for youth in similar ways as adults, in isolating them from social circles while they faced numerous changes to their daily lives. However , youth may face additional difficulty understanding their emotions and how to articulate them or seek help during this time. \"Maybe for kids, too. They were stuck. They were just sitting playing video games, and then they have to adjust going back to school. Some schools are hybrid. Some schools are still remote. So it's stress, a nd people trying to adapt to things changing faster than they can adapt to.\" \"School was an outlet for lots of things for children for activity, socialization, and then more. With the pandemic, obviously, with people having to be at home, a lot of that wa s lost...So, I think it's just added a lot of different stressors for not only the parent but for the child too, because they didn't have that structure...that affects, you know, your children's health as it relates to physical and their mental health. We, a s adults, who are struggling with change, think about the kids, and how they don't even have the skills to deal with the change.\" \"Having those honest conversations with your children, even with young children, how they're feeling around COVID ...

Key Findings Overall Health R atings Most Franklin County Residents rate their health good or more positively. However, nearly one -fifth rate their health fair or poor. Chronic Disease The percentage of adults diagnosed with arthritis, diabetes, heart disease , and high blood pressure has increased since the previous HealthMap . High blood pressure and high blood cholesterol remain the most common chronic disease diagnoses, with around one -third of adults affected. Emergency Department and Hospitalization Data The highest rate of emergency department visits, by a large margin, occur due to mental health issues. Over 50% of hospitalizations due to injury are because of falls, the rates of which have increased for adults age 65 and over since the previous HealthMap. Mortality Heart diseases and cancer are the leading causes of death for both males and females. The leading cause of youth mortality is unable to be determined, though overall rates of youth mortality have decreased since the previous HealthMap . Death, Illness, and Injury, continued 105 Regarding Franklin County residents' overall health , nearly one-fifth (19.2 %) consider their health to be \"fair\" or \"poor. \" Perceptions o f Health Status1 Franklin County Ohio USA HM20 22 HM2016 HM2019 HM2022 HM2022 Health 18.2% MORTALITY In 2018, the average life expectancy for people born in Franklin County was 77.13 years. By comparison, the average life expectancy for those born in Ohio in 2018 was 76.8 years . However, in the first half of 2020, Americans' life expectancy at birth decreased by a year, one of the largest observed decline s since World War II .1 Per the National Center for Health Statistics: \"Provisional life expectancy at birth in the first half of 2020 was the lowest level since 2006 for both the total population (77.8 years) and for males (75.1), and was the lowest level since 2007 for females (80.5 ).\" 2 Moreover, these worsening life expectancy estimates were not experienced equitably across racial and ethnic groups. From 2019 through 2020, the life expectancy estimates for non- Hispanic Black males, non -Hispanic Black females, and Hispanic males each decreased by more than 2 years of life , compared to a decrease of less than a year for White males or White females . \"Life expectancy for the non -Hispanic Black population, 72.0, declined the most, and was the lowest estimate seen since 2001 (for the Black population regardless of Hispanic origin). The Hispanic population experienced the second largest decline in life expectancy (79.9) reaching a level lower than what it was in 2006, the first year for which... estimates by Hispanic origin were produced (80.3) \" 2 This dramatic and in equitable decrease in life expectancy was caused, at least partially, by the COVID -19 pandemic.

Death, Illness, and Injury, continued 111 Community Voices on Chronic Health Conditions Specific chronic health conditions Franklin County residents see in their communities include diabetes , high blood pressure/hypertension, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD ). A common theme in community discussions was poor mobility and chronic health conditions associated with this, including obesity and disability. Community members see poor mental health, access to nutrition, access to health car e, and economic inequalities as contribut ing to these and other chronic health conditions. Chronic health conditions linked to loss of mobility were important to community members . Mobility was important for how it impact s physical activit y and the ability to get out in the community for basic needs and socialization . \"I'm seeing a lot of people who are struggling with weight gain or been struggling with mobility problems. \" \"I would say obesity would be a big one. We live in an area where there are a lot of kids. And so it definitely looks, the landscape definitely looks a little bit different than when I was younger, so to speak. And there are 1,000,001 reasons for that.\" \"I wo uld say that there's very little activity. I feel like when we see more people in our bikes or walking around in the neighborhood, that's a good sign it's a healthy community. People are out and about, but a lot of us aren't even getting out, being social being active.\" \"I think mobility is our biggest thing. I don't see a lot of people being able to get out and about.\" \"Immobility, people with canes, and people in motorized wheelchairs that go up and down the street, people in regular wheelchairs or canes, things like that.\" \"Not enough handicap parking, And the sidewalks, they have to ride their mobile wheelchairs in the street or else they will hurt themselves on these sidewalks. A lot of the people in my community are on those in the street where people are speeding by.\" \"I think about one lady that she's older, and she's struggling now with arthritis and not being able to work. And she's still caring for her disabled, adult son. It's sad because I see her. It's hard.\" Community members linked stress and poor mental health to chronic health issues. \"Not taking care of yourself. \" Death, Illness, and Injury, continued 112 \"You don't have time to destress. Like, take a break. So I think that also gives you a lot of like blood pressure, or migraines. You don't have time to just to sit and breathe, or make good meals. \" \"I read a few years ago, they did a study, and it said people that open up the newspaper to the main section or whatever first, they usually live a shorter life opposed to people that go to the sports and look at that first. Because I mean, it just puts you on edge. You're stressed out from reading all this negative stuff. \" \"I think a lot of people, fear ...Once they get kind of trapped in there and they're either by themselves and they're alon e, they just keep feeding into that fear...We're talking about mobility. Fear is definitely one that keeps people from moving about. \" Community members are aware of the impact of nutrition on chronic disease , and pointed out what they see barring adequate nutrition in their communities. \"It's how people eat, and I guess the food resources that are available in certain communities might not be available in other communities. Me personally, I think it's strategically planned o ut like that, but nutrition is a big one. \" \"They're struggling with, again, making the healthy decisions as far as food is concerned. I've had a lot of people telling me about, their cholesterol is up, their A1C is up, all the things that come with not having a healthy lifestyle. \" \"But I guess the thing that keeps coming to my mind is this singular thing of what we're trying to fight: alcohol, sugary foods, soda, yada, yada, yada. Those are all the biggest spons ors for everything we see and everyone sees day to day, billboards of Coke. Everything sponsored by Coke. \" \"Yeah, time to shop for and then make and pay for high quality ingredients. \" \"And there are people who don't have transportation, so I see them reg ularly shopping at Family Dollar because it's easily accessible , versus having to walk on a busy Main Street with no sidewalk to get to Kroger's. So, there's no sidewalk for parts of that journey. It is dangerous. I probably would go to Family Dollar too i f I didn't have a car. \" Community members spoke to the numerous barriers that keep people from accessing health care : cost, proximity, ease of scheduling, and the ability to prioritize health. \"Just access to community health programs or healthcare. Even as somebody with insurance, I still have difficulty finding access to care for different specialties or mental health things , just on the affordability side. Oftentimes, it's not covering enough to make it feasible for me at the time .\" \"Do they have doctors in your area? Or, you know, doctors' offices that they would feel comfortable going to and is there insurance there. \" Death, Illness, and Injury, continued 113 \"I feel like it's just healthcare system, a lot of like red tape barriers because my family don't have insurance. My h usband, he tried to seek his psychiatrist because he's been depressed lately. Well, the office said, 'Okay, we take walk -in appointments through this time .' And then he came in for the walk -in appointment, and they said, 'I'm sorry. You haven't been here i n six months. You'll have to make an appointment .' So then he tried calling his psychiatrist, and his psychiatrist said, 'No, I'm sorry, I can't make you an appointment. I can't make my own appointments. You'll have to talk to my secretary .' So he's going to have to wait two weeks to talk to someone when he's depressed. \" \"It's also if something hurts or like you're having like, just push through it it'll be fine, you don't have time for it, you're just going, going, going, because you think 'I will deal with it later .' [Inaudible]. And you can just ignore it and put it off.\" Community members also pointed t o economic inequalit y, which contributes to health conditions by precluding access to wealth, nutrition, and basic needs. \"And bad health is usually based upon lack of livable wages, employment opportunities, discrimination, and the hostile work environment. These things happen. Everybody can't deal with them. And it happens so disproportionately to Black and brown people.\" \"Economics. Greed. Right now, in the United States of America, we have the technology to house, feed, clothe, and get everybody medical attention, but greed is still here. It's a big thing. It's spawned legs and wants more and don't want to give anybody el se anything. So it's going to be here for a while, but we do have the technology in existence right now. Well, if everything in society was like utopia, we could grow food. We could give everybody the right nutritional foods, a sustainable place to live, a sustainable system to where everybody is generally taken care of and live harmonious...and your health is going to be better, but like I said, greed.\" Death, Illness, and Injury, continued 114 REASONS FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION Another way to identify high prevalen ce health issues that cause Franklin County residents to feel ill is to analyz e data related to emergency department utilization for the four major health systems in central Ohio. A selected list of health issues, based on community interest in this topic, is shown below , along with the rate that each of those issues are associated with emergency department utilization in Franklin County.

In 2020 , 9,426 injured patients were admitted to the hospital or transferred in or out of the emergency department for further evaluation in Franklin County. The table below lists the most frequently ob served categories of injury causes. For example, among the 9,426 patients who were hospitalized for injury in 2020 , 55% had experienced a fall whereas 15.2 % were involved in a motor vehicle crash. Top 5 Types of Injury That Lead to Hospitalization16 Franklin County HM2016 HM2019 - 4.2% 3.0% Only the top 5 mechanisms of injury that lead to hospitalization are shown; percentages for each year will not sum to 100 The next table analyzes these top five types of trauma events by the age of the patient. Those who are age 65 and older are more likely than other age groups to experience a fall that requires a hospital visit; the rate of injuries -due-to-falls for this age group has increased from the last HealthMap . Young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 often visited hospitals due to injuries sustained from motor vehicle (traffic1) injuries, motor vehicle ( non-traffic ) injuries, and firearms ; their rates for these types of injuries are higher than any other age group. 1 A motor vehicle traffic accident is any motor vehicle accident occurring on a public highway (i.e., originating, terminating, or involving a vehicle on the highway). A motor vehicle nontraffic accident is any motor vehicle accident which occurs entirely in any place other than a public highway (e.g., a driveway, a parking lot or garage ).

The Central Ohio community is well positioned to impact adverse health outcomes because of these collective efforts. Although not an ex haustive list of partners, each priority below includes community cornerstones of multi -sector partnerships that advance collective impact. A more extensive resource list will be identified during subsequent health improvement work; it will be included in future documents and at https://centralohiohospitals.org/ . Basic Needs There is a continuously growing body of evidence that support health outcomes being linked to the environments where people are bor n, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age. These conditions, commonly referred to as social determinants or root causes of health, affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality of life -outcomes and risks1. Healthy People 2030 stratifies social determinants of health into 5 domains, all of which are addressed by health and social service providers affiliated with the following organizations: United Way of Central Ohio - fights poverty by funding and coalescing a network of more than 90 non -profit partners providing opportunities and resources to meet basic needs. More information can be found at www.liveunitedcentralohio.org . Franklin County Human Service Chamber - serves a nd represents nearly 130 health and human service nonprofit organizations that prioritize public policies that include food and nutrition, health, housing, transportation, legal and reentry services, refugee and immigration services, workforce development, as well as youth and education policy. A comprehensive list of members can be found at www.humanservicechamber.org . Central Ohio Pathways HUB - Health Impact Ohio (formerly Healthcare Collaborative of Gr eater Columbus) manages the Central Ohio Pathways HUB, where Community Health Workers assist clients enrolled in the HUB with multiple factors that contribute to an individual's health, including social determinants like culture, race, income, and educatio n level.

Infant and Maternal He alth In 2014, the Greater Columbus Infant Mortality Task Force developed eight recommendations to reduce the community's alarming infant mortality rate by 40 percent and cut the racial health disparity gap in half. CelebrateOne was created in November 201 4 as a collective impact approach to carry out the Task Force's recommendations and ensure Franklin County meets its ambitious goal. More information and a list of organizational partners can be found at https://www.columbus.gov/Celebrate -One/About -CelebrateOne/ . References -and-data/social -determinants -health Summary 131 Franklin County HealthMap20 22 provide s a comprehensive overview of our community's health status and needs . There are numerous indicators that suggest the health of Franklin County, Ohio's residents compare favorably with the state and country . Franklin County HealthMap20 22 also uncovered several indicators that suggest areas in which the health of Franklin County's residents either has diminished over time or compares unfavorably to Ohio or the nation. Consistent with requirements, the participating hospitals and health departments will use this report to inform develop ment and implement ation of strategies to address its findings. It is intended that a wide range of stakeholders - many more than are represented on Franklin County HealthMap20 22's Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee - will also use this report for their own planning efforts. Subsequent planning documents and reports will be shared with stakeholders and with the public. Users of Franklin County HealthMap20 22 are encouraged to send feedback and comments that can help to improve the usefulness of this information when future editions are developed . Questions and comments about Franklin County HealthMap20 22 may be shared with: Jeff Klingler University Wexner Medical Center HealthMap2022 Implementation Strategy 2022-2024 The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 2HealthMap2022 Implementation Strategy 2022-2024 As indicated in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center's Community Health Needs Assessment, the four health systems in Franklin County, Columbus Public Health and Franklin County Public Health and several community partners jointly completed the Franklin County HealthMap2022. The Franklin County HealthMap2022 identifies four health priorities and corresponding indicators. This implementation strategy explains how the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center will address and try to impact the priorities identified in its Community Health Needs Assessment. Due to its importance for the health of our community, we have added \"Access to Care\" as an additional indicator for the first health priority, \"Basic Needs.\" The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 3COVID-19 It would be difficult to create an implementation strategy without discussing the challenges that the pandemic presented. One year into HealthMap2019, COVID-19 struck, and that changed the way that hospitals around the country provided care to their patients. Access to care looked different during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth became an essential way for patients to connect with providers during the early days of the pandemic, so that they would not be at risk for becominginfected. Moms2B, an innovative, community-based pregnancy program for low-income women, moved its educational sessions to virtual. Visitors were limited, with only a few exceptions. One such exception was for doulas who work to assist expecting mothers as they progress through the processof delivering. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center found doulas tobe a crucial part of the birthing experience for mothers who chose to use them,especially those at greater risk for disparities in birth outcomes due to race. In addition, a plan to distribute nalox one in the hospital through our Project DAWN allocation would not have succeeded if not for the creation of a partnership of amixed-disciplinary team, a local church, the Columbus Division of Fire and othersto get Narcan out into the community. We are proud of how our staff adjusted to all the changes due to COVID-19. Among many innovations in care, for example: Harding Hospital clinical staff opened a special COVID-19-positive unit that treated 40 patients for psychiatric and addiction issues during the omicron surge. Our Emergency Departmen t and Ambulatory teams worked to create efficient and accessible COVID-19 testing in our community in partnership with ColumbusPublic Health. Ambulatory also ran a state-of-the-art vaccine program out of the Schottenstein Center, and it worked with our Community Engagement team to provide vaccinesout of East Hospital to some of our most vulnerable central Ohio residents.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 4 Priority Health Needs 2022-2024 Basic Needs Specific and interrelated indicators include: Housing security (decreased homelessness, increased affordability) Financial stability Neighborhood safety (reduced crime) Food security Increased access to nutritious foods Access to care Healthy Community Center On the Near East Side, a unique Healthy Community Center is set to open in spring 2023, partially designed by neighborhood residents themselves. Taking over the previous site of the Columbus Metropolitan Library's Martin Luther King Jr. branch near East Hospital, this multipurpose facility provides no direct clinical services, but it fills a major gap in the community and demonstrates Ohio State's commitment to its neighbors' well-being. The Ohio State University Healthy Community Center will feature: a teaching kitchen with demonstrations for families and individuals of all ages a meeting center and caf\u00e9 space soundproofed multipurpose classrooms and meeting rooms that can be sectioned off as needed Food Access The science is clear that access to food, especially fruits and vegetables, is critical for improved health outcomes, prevention of disease progression and lower overall costs of medical care. Mid-Ohio Farmacy In September 2019, the Wexner Medical Center partnered with the nation's seventh-largest food bank, the Mid-Ohio Food Collective, to better connect Ohio State patients with documented food insecurity with enhanced access to fresh produce and other nutrient-rich foods. What resulted was the Mid-Ohio Farmacy, a partnership that allows Ohio State staff and providers to screen and refer patients to receive a fresh-food \"prescription\" card, with a unique Rx ID. This Rx ID permits patients weekly access to fresh produce at any of the Mid-Ohio Food Collective's 12 participating pantries in central Ohio.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 5Currently providers at these locations are prescribing the Mid-Ohio Farmacy card: Primary Care Thomas Rardin Primary Care - Family Medicine Outpatient Care East Total Health and Wellness East Hospital Maternal-Fetal Medicine at McCampbell Outpatient Care and East Hospital Diabetes-specific endocrinology clinics Primary Care - General Internal Medicine Outpatient Care East Primary Care Morehouse Outpatient Care As of March 22, 2022, 1,321 patients have benefited from the program, leading to 5,224 food pantry visits. The increased access to fruits and vegetables at food pantries improves health outcomes through nutrition, and patients don't have to spend as much of their limited budgets on food. Additional Mid-Ohio Food Collective Partnerships Other longstanding partnerships between Ohio State and Mid-Ohio Food Collective include: The Wexner Medical Center's donation of 40,000 pounds of food each year to the food bank's Second Servings program. Surplus food items are prepared intopackaged meals by our hospital kitchens. These meals head directly to SecondServings' soup kitchens and emergency shelters. Uncooked produce, bread andother foods also are donated to the food bank. Use of The James Mobile Education Kitchen. Medical center chefs and clinicians distribute food samples and hold cooking and nutrition demonstrations at foodpantries and other community locations, such as the Reeb Avenue Center.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 6Access to Care The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center identifies timely, culturally appropriate and easy to get to health care as an additional basic need and strategy for addressing racism, improving health equity and enhancing health outcomes. This need gained further attention because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the move to telehealth appointments. Telehealth has proven to be useful in reducing missed appointments among our Medicaid population and in getting more people to participate in mental health and in addiction care, especially for initial appointments. Our challenge is to make this technology available to all our patients. To improve access to care, the Wexner Medical Center has pursued multiple initiatives, including: Digital Divide We are making telehealth services work for all patients by addressing issues related to the digital divide. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Moms2B participants were each provided a tablet and internet coverage so they could participate in virtual visits. Additionally, we are participating in the Franklin County Digital Equity Coalition, a community-wide effort to holistically address the digital divide in central Ohio. In partnership with Smart Columbus, Partners Achieving Community Transformation (PACT) is playing a lead role by helping recruit households in the King-Lincoln Bronzeville neighborhood to bring affordable and reliable WiFi into their homes. Program participants receive in-home WiFi service at no cost for 12 months. After the 12-month period, participants can continue using the WiFi for no more than $20/month. Ohio State Mobile Units The Ohio State University deploys mobile health care units throughout central Ohio to improve access to care in underserved areas. In March 2020, the Wexner Medical Center added the Community Care Coach to its mobile fleet. The 38-foot coach is the first mobile primary care and Ob/Gyn unit at Ohio State. The wheelchair-accessible coach includes two exam rooms, a waiting room and a point-of-care testing lab. It provides primary care, such as vaccines, physical exams, blood tests and prenatal and postpartum care for mothers. The care coach partners with Moms2B, making prenatal care available at a number of its in-person educational sessions. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 7The Community Care Coach joins three other Ohio State mobile units. These include: The James Mobile Education Kitchen, whose purpose is to educate the public about healthy, cancer-preventive foods and how to prepare these foods at home The James Mobile Mammography Unit meets women where they live to provide an effective, affordable and convenient way to detect breast cancer The College of Dentistry's Dental Health Outreach Mobile Experience Coach, an outreach program that strives to meet the oral health needs of Ohioansin key underserved areas while training sensitive and culturally competenthealth professionals. These units are attempting to address health disparities by providing convenient care close to home and eliminating barriers such as insurance, transportation and child care. Expanding Ambulatory Services The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center continues to expand its care with a new, large ambulatory facility named Outpatient Care New Albany. The site joins outpatient care expansion plans in Dublin and Powell. The comprehensive facilities are part of a new suburban outpatient care program that supports growth in the region and excellence in academic health care. At approximately 251,000 square feet, the facility includes ambulatory surgery, endoscopy, primary care, specialty medical and surgical clinics and related support space. Outpatient Care Dublin is expected to open in summer 2022. Work will then shift to Outpatient Care Powell. Additionally, we are constructing a new outpatient cancer center that will focus on cancers that affect bone and soft tissue, blood, kidney, bladder and prostate - cancers for which treatment options have advanced to the point that outpatient care is now an option. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center Outpatient Care West Campus will include outpatient operating rooms, interventional radiology rooms, an extended recovery unit, a pre-anesthesia center, a diagnostic imaging center, retail pharmacy, a hematology clinic, a genitourinary clinic, infusion and medical office and support spaces. The approximately 385,000-square-foot cancer-focused facility will include central Ohio's first proton therapy treatment facility in partnership with Nationwide Children's Hospital. The building joins the Interdisciplinary Research Facility and an Energy Advancement and Innovation Center as the first three major projects envisioned for Ohio State's new Innovation District.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 8Transportation Assistance The Wexner Medical Center continues to work to provide better transportation assistance for our low-income patients to make it easier for them to attend appointments, especially services on our University Hospital campus. This assistance includes enhanced parking subsidies and working with more flexible ride programs, such as Lyft. Healthy State Alliance The Healthy State Alliance, a strategic partnership between the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center and Catholic health ministry Bon Secours Mercy Health, is investing resources and providing tangible solutions to tackle Ohio's most critical health needs. The alliance is committed to transforming the health of the communities we serve, while making health care more affordable and accessible for all. We are pursuing enhancing food access through the Healthy State Alliance. Through our partnership, we will explore providing our patients with access to Produce Perks Midwest, an Ohio nonprofit that increases affordable access to healthy food, supports local farmers and strengthens local economies. Produce Perks doubles the purchasing power for families and individuals who receive SNAP when they purchase healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables. One of our initial joint alliance priorities was increasing access to telehealth services. Our institutions have a long history of using telehealth, which prepared us well to respond to patients' needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth has become a normal way of providing care to our patients, across types of providers and conditions - from primary care to specialty care and disease management. Telehealth increasesaccess to care, particularly for individuals with barriers to care such as transportation.It can save patients money as compared to coming to an in-person visit, in the cost ofgas, parking, lost wages and/or child care, which for some patients is not insignificant.Since we have expanded telehealth visits, our no-show and late cancelation rateshave dropped among our entire patient populations, but particularly for Medicaidparticipants. However, the benefits of this new technology are limited in areas without access to reliable, affordable broadband service. The Healthy State Alliance successfully advocated to ensure state funding was allocated for the Residential Broadband Expansion Grant Program to help meet the digital needs of Ohioans.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 9Creating Financial Stability for Our Own The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center is committed to addressing the social and behavioral factors that influence health in central Ohio. But that commitment does not just extend to members of the community. We want to provide the same support to Wexner Medical Center faculty and staff who are facing challenges in their personal lives. In 2020, the minimum wage for Ohio State Wexner Medical Center employees was raised to $15 per hour. About 3,800 employees benefited from the pay raise. An additional 1,000 employees already earning $15 per hour moved to a rate of $16 per hour. Additionally, the Employee Resource Center (ERC) was founded in January 2021. It has helped 227 medical center employees who were experiencing a life change or crisis by connecting them to confidential resources at Ohio State and in the community that focus on social determinants of health, including food insecurity, housing, transportation, education and financial counseling. The ERC is also working to address additional needs, including launching a \"scrub drive\" in May to collect new and gently used scrubs for employees who need them. Finally, the Wexner Medical Center is partnering with the Columbus Urban League to conduct monthly virtual job fairs to recruit and provide support for new employees who better reflect our patients. Healthcare Anchor Network In August 2021, the Wexner Medical Center became the 70th member of the Healthcare Anchor Network (HAN). HAN members seek to intentionally apply their institution's long-term, place-based economic power and human capital in partnership with their community to mutually benefit the long-term well-being of both. Areas of emphasis include local and diverse hiring and workforce development, local and diverse sourcing and place-based investing. The Wexner Medical Center is developing strategies for all three of these areas in the coming year. The purpose of these efforts is to address upstream causes of social determinants of health affecting the health of our community's residents and the patients we serve. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 10Housing The Wexner Medical Center Housing Program was created for patients and their support members who need temporary housing assistance while receiving care at the Wexner Medical Center. We offer accommodations through a hotel partnership designed to relieve the burden of lodging expenses that would be a barrier to successful completion of their care plan. This has been especially critical to support patients and their caregivers in our cancer and transplant service lines who are experiencing either housing insecurity or who live a significant distance from Columbus and do not have the financial resources to afford local hotel accommodations. Additionally, the Wexner Medical Center is partnering with Move to Prosper to explore ways to connect to our Moms2B participants. Move to Prosper provides families with three years of rental support, rental home or apartment; a life coach; and integration assistance into one's new life. PACT (Partners Achieving Community Transformation) In 2010, PACT began with a $10 million investment from the Wexner Medical Center. PACT is a partnership between the city of Columbus, the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority and community neighbors that has worked to develop a revitalization plan called the Blueprint for Community Investment. The plan, designed to empower Black residents through engagement, decision making and self-determination, seeks to make the Near East Side neighborhood a healthy, sustainable community offering residents access to safe, affordable homes; quality health care and education; and local employment opportunities. The original $30 million investment by the three original partners was leveraged into an additional $30 million federal Housing and Urban Development grant in 2014.Then, based on this sound foundation of commitment to the Near East Side, Fifth Third Bank announced a $20 million investment in the Near East Side in fall 2021 as part of the financial institution's $180 million national Neighborhood Investment Program in collaboration with Enterprise Community Partners. The program supports revitalization in majority-Black communities throughout the country that have experienced a sustained period of disinvestment. Columbus is one of nine cities to receive the award. Fifth Third will distribute the $20 million over three years in the form of small business and neighborhood revitalization loans, residential mortgages and philanthropic donations. PACT's Blueprint for Community Investment will continue to serve as the framework for guiding these opportunities.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 11PACT and its partners will leverage the neighborhood's rich cultural legacy to create an economic impact corridor. They aim to carry out that work in a way that honors the Near East Side's history, while building Black futures in the neighborhood. The organization and its partners will leverage this new infusion of funds from Fifth Third Bank to: Develop a Black-owned bank and grocery store Support public art creation across the neighborhood Provide down payment support for middle-income and ladder-up housing opportunities that build generational wealth Expand health, dental and optometry services Create financial education, literacy and savings programs for area youth What We Will Do Open the Healthy Community Center in the s pring 2023. Expand access to the Mid-Ohio Farmacy program. Continue to work through the Healthy State Alliance to make health care more affordable and accessible for all. Administer the Fifth Third Bank's Neighborhood Investment Program in the PACT neighborhood to improve financial security and housing security. Continue to address access to care through work around the digital divide. Bring care to our patients and provide them with transit assistance. Explore how we can support housing security in the community through the Healthcare Anchor Network.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 12 Racial Equity Specific indicators include: (Effects on) Economic and housing stability (Effects on) Quality health care, mental health and feelings of safety (Effects on) Maternal and infant health outcomes Racism as a Social Determinant of Health The term \"social determinants of health\" refers to the environmental conditions in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship and age that affect health. Racism is a prominent social determinant of health. It is a driving force behind inequities in housing, income, education and other social determinants that lead to poor health outcomes among Black and brown communities. It can manifest itself in policies, practices, resource allocation, education and training and patient care without deliberate, focused efforts to remove structural racism and implicit or explicit bias from the health care system. Academic health centers have the power and influence to help change this. Therefore, we must do all that we can to eliminate the negative impact of racism on the health and well-being of our patients and their families through the work of our students, faculty and workforce here at the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center. Ohio State's excellence in education, research, clinical care and community engagement stands at the center of our mission, vision and values at the Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute and Ohio State's health sciences colleges. Anti-Racism Action Plan As health care leaders, we have a responsibility to end racism. Racism has so many negative impacts on individuals in our society, but, specifically as a determinant of health, it contributes to the premature illness, injury, disability and death of Black, indigenous and people of color in our community. In 2020, the Wexner Medical Center established its Anti-Racism Action Plan with a goal to continue building on our decades-long commitment to serving vulnerable populations in our community to positively influence overall health and well-being. Through our focused anti-racism initiatives, we are taking steps to engage individuals and organizations across our community to learn and participate in community anti-racism efforts. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 13 We have also worked to equip our leaders, managers and team members with tools and resources to help us address systemic racism and unconscious bias within our organization, including the popular Implicit Bias Mitigation Workshop that fulfills the medical center's diversity training requirement. In July 2021, the medical center released our inaugural Health Equity and Anti-Racism (HEAR) report, which provided a snapshot of what we achieved together through the first year of these concerted efforts. Heading into the second year of the Anti-Racism Action Plan, we will go deeper into topics and tools for change. Two opportunities that will give faculty and staff ways to advance their learning and ability to support health equity for our patients are: Anti-Racism, Inclusion, Support, Education (ARISE): A new initiative under the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center Anti-Racism Action Plan Faculty andStaff Training and Development workgroup, ARISE offers a virtual museumexperience that invites faculty and staff to explore topics related to racial justiceand inclusion. Visitors can click on exhibits and engage with videos, art, currentevents, articles, resources and reflection opportunities. Series II of Roundtable on Actions Against Racism (ROAAR): The first program in Series II offers perspectives on how public health and health care systemsmoved from statements against racism to actions in addressing healthdisparities in vulnerable communities. OSUCCC - James Diversity, Equity and Inclusion At The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion has never been stronger. The OSUCCC - James has as an unwavering commitment to equality and justice for all, and zero tolerance for racism, bigotry and hate of any kind. We recognize and appreciate the importance of creating an environment in which all employees feel valued, included and empowered to do their best work and bring great ideas to the table. We recognize that each employee's unique experiences, perspectives and viewpoints add value to our ability to create and deliver the best possible cancer care to our patients. At the OSUCCC - James, we are committed to fighting systemic racism, creating better employment and advancement opportunities for people of color and becoming a more inclusive and diverse institution. We believe this is fundamental to driving innovation and to achieving our mission of eradicating cancer from individuals' lives by creating knowledge and integrating groundbreaking research with excellence in education and patient-centered care.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 14Through our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Task Force, we will identify immediate and long-term strategies to accelerate change and become a more inclusive and diverse institution - because it is essential to maintaining our reputation for world-class cancer care, research and education. Center for Cancer Health Equity Research suggests that up to half of all patients report transportation as a barrier to obtaining health care. Furthermore, some patients have nowhere to go: in Ohio, six rural counties have no hospital, and several have few or no mammography facilities. The Center for Cancer Health Equity is among Ohio State's efforts to close that access gap by taking care directly to patients - whether they live in underserved Columbus neighborhoods or in surrounding rural cities and counties with limited health care facilities. Among these initiatives are mobile units, outreach programs and innovative, expanded methods of health care. While geography is a key part to closing the access gap, most of Ohio State's efforts go beyond just meeting people where they live. Understanding how culture plays into someone's health care is also key, as is speaking their language. The Center for Cancer Health Equity seeks employees from the communities it serves; its 17 outreach and engagement staff include three employees who focus on rural and Appalachian efforts, three who focus on African American outreach, six who work with Hispanic and new American communities, one who focuses on LGBTQ+ initiatives and four patient navigators. The staff also include bilingual employees who speak Spanish, Somali, Mandarin and Nepali. One example of a community outreach program organized by the Center for Cancer Health Equity seeks to increase preventive screening and cancer education in underserved communities, including those with Hispanic, Somali, Bhutanese-Nepali and other immigrant groups. The team holds regular events at local community centers to educate area residents about early cancer detection and treatment. Over the years, the Center for Cancer Health Equity has held or participated in over 625 events with 27,000 people reached, provided navigation for 7,000 patients, increased enrollment into Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Programs and built relationships with over 250 community partners in the state.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 15Colorectal Cancer in the Black community In 2022, a team of colorectal cancer experts from The James launched a new initiative aimed at improving early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer in the Black community, which has historically been placed at increased risk for colorectal cancer due to a lack of timely colorectal cancer screening and barriers to receiving health care services. Through the new initiative being conducted in partnership between the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center and the Center for Cancer Health Equity at the OSUCCC - James, at-home colorectal cancer screening kits were mailed to 400 patients who qualify for - but have not yet received - a colorectal cancer screening exam. These patients can perform this simple test in their homes with the aid of pictures and easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions that include details for packaging the samples and sending them back to us for analysis. After the at-home test is returned for analysis, our Population Health clinical team will monitor results and contact patients and their primary care physician about any abnormal results. Community Valued Partners Beginning even before the COVID-19 vaccine was available to the general public, the Wexner Medical Center Community and Civic Engagement team began working in the community to counteract disinformation and rumors about side effects, risks and the impact of the vaccine on specific patient populations. The Community Valued Partners program collaborated with community stakeholders, including churches and community-based organizations, to address resident concerns and questions about the vaccine - even going door-to-door to spread credible information about the vaccine. Through conversation, they determined people's needs and addressed barriers to getting the vaccine, including daycare, food, transportation and adding a modesty room out of respect for certain religions. A few weeks after opening our mass vaccination site at the Schottenstein Center, we worked with the Analytics Center of Excellence team to evaluate who we were reaching at that facility. The data showed that people coming to the campus location were predominantly white, and fewer people of color were being vaccinated than expected. In response, we quickly mobilized multiple strategies to increase our engagement with people living in underserved and immigrant communities around Columbus. We launched a public vaccination center at East Hospital, which, along with our other locations, helped serve more than 13,000 individuals from 11 identified underserved ZIP codes downtown and on the Near East and South sides of Columbus, not including medical center faculty and staff. This work represented some of the nation's best for addressing the health care disparities, systemic racism and other social determinants of health that drive COVID-19's more negative impact on communities of color across the country. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 16In addition to this work, we teamed up to help with these important COVID-19 vaccination efforts: Several physicians from East Hospital had a monthly dinner with pastors at a church within walking distance of the hospital to champion the benefits of thevaccine and build relationships and trust. The External Vaccine Education W orkgroup provided patient navigation to help individuals overcome obstacles such as transportation and language differencesthat might prevent them from receiving the vaccine. The Center for Cancer Health Equity offered its team, including patient navigators, to follow up with the people who registered through the CommunityValued Partners Program to be sure they had what they needed to get there. The Community Engagement Task Force worked closely with the COVID-19 Vaccine Call Center to find alternative ways to register people for vaccinationswhen they could not access digital technology. These community partnerships have formed strong bonds. Today, the newly named Community Valued Partners comprises 39 partners. They continue to collaborate with the medical center, and together we are addressing ways to improve health care and health equity for our communities. Navigating Implicit Bias Influencing change and reducing health and health care disparities across the country starts with individual understanding and behavior. That is why The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center has developed robust, diverse and thoughtful training that gives staff and faculty support as well as tools to tackle their own biases. As part of required annual training, faculty and staff can choose from nearly 20 training topics, including transgender health, disabilities etiquette, poverty and a hugely popular implicit bias training developed in collaboration with Ohio State's Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity. The variety and diversity of training opportunities is intentional, developed with current events and diverse patient populations in mind, as well as with feedback from engagement surveys and employee resource groups \u2014 voluntary, employee-led groups that focuses on meeting the needs of LGBTQ+ employees, veterans, young professionals, Black faculty and staff and more. In 2020, two cultural competency training curriculum tracks were formed: one devoted to cultural awareness, equity and inclusion, and the other dedicated to anti-racism awareness, sparked by the outrage over Black and brown lives lost because of institutional racism. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 17Among the new 2020 training offerings were the 21-Day Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Challenge, which the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center modeled after a plan developed by educator Eddie Moore Jr., PhD, director of The Privilege Institute. The idea behind the challenge is to complete one action each day for 21 days to further an individual's, group's or department's understanding of power, privilege, supremacy, systemic racism, oppression and equity. Suggestions include readings, podcasts and videos, as well as actions to interrupt racist behavior. The challenge is followed by monthly facilitated group sessions called \"Conversations that Matter,\" in which participants share their experiences and are encouraged to reflect on their emotions and perspectives openly and honestly. The medical center's offerings now include the new Certificate of Inclusive Excellence Program, in which employees can complete training to earn different levels of certification: Partner, Champion or Ambassador. At each level, the employee signs a formal pledge signaling their commitment to fostering inclusive excellence. Implicit bias training is also expanding. In January 2021, Implicit Bias Mitigation (IBM) workshops launched for the Wexner Medical Center and the health science colleges. These virtual workshops, with updated curriculum, continue the legacy of the implicit bias workshops. A key learning objective of the workshop is to mitigate implicit bias by identifying our preferred groups to better practice intentional inclusion of the other. In April 2021, a special IBM program customized for search committees was created and launched. Ohio State's efforts to empower future health professionals begin early, through recruiting and admitting a diverse student body and preparing those students for success. And each year, the colleges strengthen and advance their initiatives to equip students with the proper training, support, mentorship and education to properly address social determinants of health. Additionally, the Patient Experience and Clinical Services workgroup has created the Process and Strategies for Responding to Workplace Bias poster to help our medical center continue to make strides toward reaching the goals set through the Anti-Racism Action Plan. The poster provides resources and information to help faculty and staff assess and resolve implicit bias. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 18Capacity Building Starting in the summer of 2021, several Wexner Medical Center staff participated in programs to help develop capacities and strategies to advance health equity. These learning efforts included Vizient's five-part Health Equity Leadership Series, the Center for Community Investment's Accelerating Investments for Healthy Communities program (the Wexner Medical Center was one of six participating health systems) and national conference and the Healthcare Anchor Network's Fall Conference. These engagements also provide the Wexner Medical Center with an ability to benchmark our performance against other participating health care systems. We will be incorporating these learnings in our health equity and HAN activities over the next three years. Racism and Racial Bias Education in Women's Health Clinics The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recognizes racial bias as an issue that affects patients, either directly by subjecting them or their families to inequitable treatment, or indirectly by creating a stressful and unhealthy environment. Ohio Better Birth Outcomes (OBBO), which is a Central Ohio Hospital Council-supported collaborative of hospital- and Federally Qualified Health Center-based prenatal clinics, is working to address racism and racial bias by providing continuing education for all stakeholders across the care continuum on racial bias, stigma, discrimination and the history and effects of structural racism in reproductive health. The goal of this work is to decrease racial disparities in maternal and infant mortality and early prematurity and to improve patient experience. In 2022, OBBO will convene a conference, with a mixture of virtual, in-person and recorded offerings in coordination with a Black-led, community-based organization. Core sessions and breakout sessions will be offered to all hospital staff directly connected with women's health. In addition, a program led by Ohio State maternal-fetal medicine specialists aims to analyze the health care experiences of minority women \u2014 particularly African American women \u2014 and turn the information into guidance to help health care providers give more patient-centered, culturally sensitive care. The Disparities in Maternal Health program, funded through an Ohio Department of Health grant, began surveying women in mid-March 2021. Participating patients are surveyed early in pregnancy through the postpartum phase, examining their history and exposure with perceived medical biases in prenatal, labor/delivery and postpartum care. The goal of this program is to understand links between patients' experiences with bias, medical mistrust and other health care barriers, and how these experiences affect prenatal care. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 19Supplier Diversity For several years, the four Franklin County hospital systems have collaborated to strengthen their support of and participation with diverse business entities. The systems have employed a variety of initiatives, including meet-and-greet events to assist local minority- and women-owned businesses in understanding the needs of each hospital system and navigating the hospital contracting process. In addition, the hospitals have developed a guide to assist business owners in navigating the hospital contracting process. In 2022, the systems will hold three virtual sessions, each focused on a minority-owned business working in the information technology space. The goal of these events is to assist local W/MBE IT companies that currently work with one or more of the hospital systems in growing their business by contracting with additional hospital systems. Health Information Translations Dating back to 2005, the Franklin County hospital systems have worked together to address health education needs for low-literacy and limited-English-speaking patients by launching HealthInfoTranslations.org. The website offers more than 3,000 free resources, translated into 21 languages, including Arabic, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Nepali, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese. The site receives, on average, more than 8,000 visits a month. Most users come from Ohio, but the site has served users from all states in the country and from nearly 100 foreign countries. What We Will Do Finalize and approve the OSUCCC - James' Diversity, Equity and Inclusion plans and metrics of accountability for cancer program. Release year two of the Health Equity and Anti-Racism (HEAR) report. Send screening tests that can be administered at home to patients at high-risk for colorectal cancer.

Examine quality metrics through a race equity lens.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy2 20 Behavioral Health Specific indicators include: Access to mental health care resources Screening for mental health issues Decreased unintentional drug and alcohol deaths Youth mental health supports (clinical, social) Ohio's battle to reduce some of the nation's highest rates of mental illness and addiction began long before we heard of COVID-19. The pandemic made things worse. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center's Behavioral Health and Addiction teams met the challenges of these compounding public health crises even as the pandemic forced them to create physical distance with the people who needed their personalized care. No one was immune from the pandemic's strain. Reports of depression, anxiety, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder doubled and, in some cases, tripled over the past two years. Overdoses in Franklin County were the highest on record in 2020 and 2021. Suicide rates climbed in Ohio's communities of color and rural communities, and Ohio adults reported the highest increase in suicidal thoughts in the nation in 2021. MENTAL HEALTH Behavioral Health Immediate Care Program seeks to fill gaps in access to care To close gaps in the continuum of care for people requiring behavioral health services, the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center has initiated a Behavioral Health Immediate Care Program. The program seeks to assist two groups of patients in particular need of continuous access to care. The first group is people discharged from an inpatient hospitalization waiting to see a provider. This group may have to wait months before seeing a clinician at a time when they are most likely to decompensate or be at risk for suicide. Their diagnoses cover a whole range of severe mental illnesses. Staff members schedule to see the patient within seven days of discharge from an acute inpatient hospital and then initiate routine appointments or phone calls to check in with patients. They are available to monitor symptoms, including medication side effects, ensure compliance with safety planning and provide counseling as needed. They also provide case management services, such as coordination of non-psychiatric medical issues and facilitation of community outpatient follow-up. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 21Important goals are to make sure an individual takes prescribed medicine as directed and shows up for the first outpatient visit. Services are provided for up to eight weeks after hospital discharge. The second group of people is those under outpatient care who are in crisis. With outpatient behavioral health treatment, patients often go three or six months between visits with their provider. People in crisis who do not meet the criteria for hospitalization benefit from a bridging service to provide care when they need it. The Immediate Care Program provides that bridge to the next appointment with counseling, video visits and medication adjustments or refills. Same-day appointments are available, and patients can seek care once or several times until they are able to be seen by their provider or be linked in the community. While virtual visits began during the start of the pandemic, walk-in appointments began in September 2021. The Immediate Care Program team includes psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, social workers, case managers and a nurse. They staff phone lines five days a week. Nearly 1,406 unique patients have been served since the program began in spring 2020. The staff is tracking data to confirm that services provided are meaningful to patients and are achieving desired outcomes. TALK Campaign for Mental Health Every day, 130 people in the U.S. die from suicide. That is more than 47,000 every year. During the pandemic, the number of people struggling with mental health more than doubled. The Ohio State Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health is working to provide safer suicide prevention care across the health system through its Change Zero Suicide, a framework for health care systems that includes assessment, safety planning and aftercare components, and its TALK program to end suicide. TALK stands for: Tell them you care Act immediately Listen without judgment Know that treatment work s TALK was launched at the Ohio State-Purdue football game on Nov. 13, 2021, with the use of posters, billboards and audio and video announcements throughout the stadium to communicate the importance of breaking the silence around mental illness that can lead to suicide.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 22The Early Psychosis Intervention Center (EPICENTER) Although many people suffering with confusing and distressing mental health concerns feel alone, psychosis - which is most likely to occur in young adults - is quite common. In fact, nearly three of every 100 young people will experience a psychotic episode. Psychotic symptoms occur in people from every different social, cultural, economic, ethnic and racial background. The key to recovery is early intervention. As with physical illness, treatment early in the course of a mental illness can lead to better outcomes. The longer the illness is left untreated, the greater the potential disruption to the person's ability to transition into adulthood, fulfill the demands of school or work, meet new people or become fully independent. The Early Psychosis Intervention Center (EPICENTER) at Ohio State was established to deliver comprehensive behavioral health services to youth and young adults who are showing the early warning signs of a burgeoning psychotic disorder or who have experienced a first onset of psychotic symptoms within the last five years. This includes treatment for illnesses such as: Schizophrenia Schizoaffective disorder Bipolar disorder (with psychotic features) Unspecified psychosis Major depressive disorder (with psychotic features) It is encouraging to know that for many people, recovery is possible. Ongoing support can help individuals enjoy significant improvement and more effective illness management so that they may lead more productive, fulfilling lives. At EPICENTER, people have the opportunity to discuss their concerns, get practical support and participate in research studies. Based on each individual's needs, a team of experts from different fields, such as psychology, psychiatry, nursing and social work, will create a specialized, phase-specific treatment plan to help minimize symptoms, reduce stress and improve function and independence. The goal is to help each person return to daily life feeling more secure and positive about the future, knowing their illness does not need to define their future or their goals.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 23Stress, Trauma And Resilience (STAR) The Stress, Trauma And Resilience (STAR) Program at The Ohio State University Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health focuses on three areas: support for health care professionals and first responders, support for trauma survivors and leading-edge research on the impact of stress and trauma. The STAR Trauma Recovery Center (STAR TRC) \u2014 one of the first of its kind in the Midwest \u2014 provides comprehensive psychiatric care that is specially equipped to assist with particularly traumatic incidents. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center Emergency Department and other medical center physicians refer patients directly to the STAR TRC. In addition, other hospitals \u2014 and even other trauma centers in Columbus or the nearby region \u2014 frequently refer individuals because of STAR TRC's extensive programming and level of psychiatric care. Patients receive standardized assessments based on research, and our evidence-based treatment is given with compassion and respect for each person. TRC services are available free of charge, and survivors of traumatic events receive not only counseling, but also case management and medication management. In addition to community outreach to build awareness in underserved populations who are frequently unable to access care, TRC team members are also committed to victim advocacy. Because each trauma experience is unique, treatment is tailored to the individual. Care teams may include physicians, licensed social workers, clinical counselors, case managers, psychiatrists, nurses and other professionals who coordinate internal and community resources to navigate each recovery process. In support of health care professionals and hospital systems, the STAR Program has developed the Brief Emotional Support Team (BEST) program, which introduces evidence-based techniques that equip professionals to respond effectively in a crisis while also engaging in skills that build resilience to cope with chronic exposure to stress. This peer-support model creates a culture of compassion and helps colleagues learn how to care for each other in the demanding, difficult, harrowing and crucial work that they do each day. The STAR Program also has developed the F.I.R.S.T. (First Incident Response Support Technology) Support app for first responders. Backed by research completed at The Ohio State University, the F.I.R.S.T. Support app uses proven methods to help reduce stress and increase resilience.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 24At its core, the strength of fire and police departments is based on the strength of working relationships. The F.I.R.S.T. program provides a common language for first responders to process difficult runs and challenges faced in the intensity of their work environment. Department trainings are available that take what first responders do and see each day and provide a method to process these events. The F.I.R.S.T. program has demonstrated statistically significant decreases in issues related to depersonalization, burnout and avoidance. There are times when more than an interactive application is needed, so individual and group support sessions are available through the STAR Program. Franklin County Bedboard Through the Central Ohio Hospital Council (COHC), central Ohio psychiatric providers are working together to ensure timely access for patients in need of inpatient psychiatric services. Franklin County's three adult hospital systems are partnering with other inpatient psychiatric providers to communicate psychiatric bed availability and match open beds with patients in need of inpatient placement. The Bedboard Group has developed a web-based, secure Bedboard listing all psychiatric patients needing admission in the county as well as all open beds. This collaborative effort has reduced the wait time for patients in local emergency departments by 70% since 2018, and it has led to a better working relationship with psychiatric care providers in the community. Mental Health and Addiction Crisis Center Born from discussions within the Bedboard Group came a broader community discussion on ways to improve the crisis system, specifically on ways to decrease the number of patients presenting in emergency departments in psychiatric crisis. In partnership with the Alcohol Drug and Mental Health (ADAMH) Board of Franklin County, the three adult hospital systems worked with several community stakeholders to develop a plan for the construction of a new Crisis Center for Franklin County residents. A steering committee, co-chaired by ADAMH and COHC, oversaw the development of the plan, with strategic work groups building out specific portions of the plan. Including support from the three adult hospital systems, nearly $45 million has been raised for the construction of the Crisis Center. The center is expected to open in early 2024. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 25Care for Our Own We have several programs that provide health and well-being resources for our own faculty and staff. These teams supported health care professionals as they met the relentless demands of the pandemic. Our team of specialized providers in the STAR Program has provided support for all medical center employees during the pandemic through a wide range ofrespite and self-care programs developed to address pandemic-related stress,as well as private counseling sessions and around-the-clock mental health crisisintervention. Psychiatry residents set up an informal peer support program through which they offered their behavioral health expertise to residents in other specialties. The Behavioral Emergency Response Team, trained to de-escalate situations involving upset patients or family members, shielded our frontline workersfrom an increasing number of intense and potentially volatile situationsexacerbated by the pandemic. ADDICTION The opioid crisis has hit Ohio particularly hard, and the COVID-19 pandemic has made it even more difficult to make treatment and recovery services accessible to those who need them. According to a report from Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost's Scientific Committee on Opioid Prevention and Education, more Ohioans died of an opioid overdose during a three-month period in 2020 than at any time since the opioid crisis began. That is why The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center has committed resources to fighting opioid use disorder at every angle, launching multidisciplinary research on the crisis and swiftly adapting services for an evolving foe. Naloxone Training and Distribution Among the most immediate and accessible services the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center provides in this effort is free naloxone and training for using it. The nasal-spray drug can temporarily reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, blocking opioids' effects on the brain and restoring breathing. When given in time, naloxone can save a life. Since 2015, Wexner Medical Center emergency departments have distributed naloxone to those at risk of overdose and their family and friends. Beginning in 2018, the Ohio State College of Public Health collaborated with the Wexner Medical Center, Equitas Health and other university groups to hold free training sessions that distributed naloxone kits to the public. In July 2019, the Ohio Department of Health's The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 26Project DAWN (Deaths Avoided With Naloxone) granted funds to the Wexner Medical Center, giving us the ability to significantly widen our naloxone distribution beyond the emergency department setting to include all inpatient beds, Talbot Hall and all outpatient pharmacies. The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center was the first hospital system in Ohio to offer naloxone across the entire hospital setting. Today, free naloxone kits are available at each of the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center's emergency departments, seven hospitals, including through Talbot Hall Addiction Medicine, and select high-risk outpatient clinics. Kits are also available to anyone \u2014 no prescription necessary \u2014 at Ohio State Wexner Medical Center outpatient pharmacies at Doan Hall, East Hospital and the OSUCCC - James, and the university's Wilce Student Health Services Pharmacy. Pharmacy, medical and nursing staff provide instructions for using it. In addition, at the onset of the pandemic, the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center and Project DAWN pivoted to distribute naloxone directly to community members in their neighborhoods. Partnerships with the local health departments and Columbus Division of Fire's RREACT (Rapid Response Emergency Addiction and Crisis Team) program prompted growth in outreach and collaboration that now occurs several times per month across the central Ohio area, as well as outreach events on campus to reach college students. Distribution has expanded to include fentanyl test strips, drug disposal bags and information on treatment resources and other harm reduction practices. Expanding Access to Care for Addiction A systemwide project to better coordinate initiation of medication for opioid use disorder (OUD) allows the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center to open new entry points for addiction treatment and hire more dedicated care coordinators and peer supporters. By tying together all the services that treat opioid use disorder, treatment becomes more accessible to everyone who needs it. This allows for high-quality, evidence-based OUD care no matter where someone enters our health care system \u2014 not just if they show up at Ohio State Talbot Addiction Medicine for specific addiction services, but also if they arrive at a primary care office or the emergency room and are admitted with an infection that is a consequence of their addiction. Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder in the ED In 2017, the Wexner Medical Center received a grant from the Ohio Department of Health in partnership with Franklin County Public Health to begin what was then called medication-assisted treatment in the emergency department (ED). Through the grant, we hired ED-based peer supporters who connected patients to treatment as well as to ADAMH Franklin County's established Southeast RREACT (Rapid Response Emergency Addiction and Crisis Team) program to transfer patients presenting in the emergency department to treatment facilities including Maryhaven Addiction The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 27Stabilization Center, Talbot and other local treatment agencies for coordinated care of OUD. We have continued to supplement treatment of OUD with balanced harm-reduction practices, including naloxone distribution, sexually transmitted infections screening and treatment, hepatitis A and COVID-19 vaccination, and fentanyl test strip distribution given the unfortunate occurrence of contaminated drug supply and increasing unintentional overdose deaths. This program has been a model of care across Franklin County and Ohio through the National Institutes of Health's HEALing Initiatives Study, which is based at Ohio State. Finally, given the success of this program, our EDs are expanding to address all substances with a comprehensive coordination of care that involves the ED, a critical entry point for those who lack routine care or are under/uninsured. An ED-based addiction consult service will be developed this year to further enhance our ability to provide evidence-based care on site in our EDs. Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder in the Inpatient Setting The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center's hospitalists have been prescribing medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) for patients hospitalized with acute illnesses often related to intravenous drug use since 2018. Availability has expanded throughout the main campus, and most recently to East Hospital with the development of the addiction medicine fellowship program. Together since the beginning of 2020, the inpatient MOUD and Addiction Medicine consult services have completed 4,000 consults, initiating patients on MOUD and linking them to a MOUD provider and recovery services at discharge. This team also works closely with area skilled nursing facilities to ensure those complex patients continue to receive their addiction care after leaving the hospital. Primary Care Addiction Medicine The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center also has recently opened a new Primary Care Addiction Medicine clinic within Ohio State Outpatient Care East. Primary Care Addiction Medicine treats patients with known substance use disorders or who have a concern of developing a substance use disorder. A multidisciplinary team works with patients until they are stabilized and have a clear treatment plan. At that point, the clinic transitions patients back to their regular primary care provider or assists them with finding a primary care provider who is comfortable providing substance use disorder treatment. Reducing Opioids for Surgery The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 28An Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol that began at Wexner Medical Center in 2016 has helped patients manage postsurgical pain without relying on narcotics. Beginning with microvascular breast reconstruction surgeries, ERAS swaps opioids for non-narcotic pain medicine before surgery and avoids long-acting narcotics in the operating room. After surgery, patients take acetaminophen or ibuprofen, with the option of a low-dose opioid for pain spikes. Buoyed by high patient satisfaction rates, the practice has steadily expanded to other inpatient surgery areas, such as colorectal, bariatric and abdominal wall reconstruction. In 2020, the Division of General and Gastrointestinal Surgery shifted focus to outpatient surgeries, embarking on a three-year study to observe participating patients who undergo select outpatient procedures in general and gastrointestinal surgery, surgical oncology, trauma and vascular surgery. Researchers aim to determine whether a new postoperative pain management idea \u2014 one that does not send patients home with opioid prescriptions \u2014 could adequately help patients control their pain, reducing the risk of opioid abuse. The Toward Opioid-Free Ambulatory Surgery (TOFAS) study has found that in patients undergoing hernia surgery and discharged the day of the procedure, more than half of opioid prescriptions are not used. Reducing the use of opioids postsurgery eliminates the availability of unnecessary opiates and reduces the potential for opioid addiction, whether within a patient's household or the community. Palliative Harm-Reduction Clinic This clinic, in operation since September 2020, is the first of its kind in the nation. It combines principles of addiction management, harm reduction and palliative medicine to provide symptom management to patients with both severe cancer pain and substance use disorders. This population needs specialized care, and many have previously been disqualified from cancer pain management services because of their substance use. It currently operates one day a week under palliative specialist Sachin Kale, MD, who says there are active plans to expand the clinic given the high need for its services. Residential Treatment Program Expansion Ohio State's Talbot Hall will be expanding to offer a residential treatment program. Whereas Talbot Addiction Medicine currently offers short, inpatient stays for just three to five days followed by outpatient care programs, this new program will offer a stay of up to 30 days in a residential-level care model with medication, behavioral therapy and social support. This allows Talbot to give patients the full spectrum of care in an evidence-based environment that also allows patients to continue their medication for opioid use disorder. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 29Addiction Medicine Collaborates with Infectious Diseases The Division of Infectious Diseases and the Addiction Medicine program have begun enhancing their collaboration with more coordinated care, as infections are a common, severe co-occurring disease for many patients with addiction. The STEPP clinic and Talbot Hall, for example, now offer hepatitis C care and are exploring the use of HIV preventive medication. Addiction Medicine Education The Ohio State Addiction Medicine teams provide educational experiences for a variety and trainees, including students from the College of Medicine, College of Nursing and College of Social Work; residents from internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, psychiatry and podiatry; and fellows from palliative medicine and pain medicine. In 2017, the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center addiction medicine fellowship was founded and became one of the first fellowships in the country to be approved by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education in 2018. In 2020, the Wexner Medical Center was awarded at Health Resources & Services Administration grant, which allowed the addiction medicine fellowship to expand to four spots per year. Additionally, in 2019, the Wexner Medical Center was awarded the PCSS-Universities Opioid Education Grant, which facilitated DATA-2000 X-waiver training for all graduating medical students as well as residents from primary care disciplines. Mindfulness Pain Management A home visiting program for patients with sickle cell disease has expanded to include a three-year, community-based participatory research project that will test how well a mobile app can train these adult patients to use mindfulness-based pain management effectively. Substance Abuse Treatment, Education and Prevention Program For expectant parents, substance abuse disorders can further complicate pregnancies that may already be at risk based on other social determinants. To have pregnancies that produce healthy, full-term babies, these patients need specialized care to overcome addiction. Through an innovative clinic called Substance Abuse Treatment, Education and Prevention Program (STEPP), Ohio State maternal-fetal medicine specialists are increasing the odds for those babies to live beyond their first birthday. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 30The clinic's expert team includes a dedicated nurse, a social worker and a team of physicians. They hold more than a decade of experience leading weekly sessions that provide personalized, high-risk obstetric care, treatment and counseling. STEPP's first graduate from its one-year postpartum program is a mother who began with the clinic at 39 weeks pregnant, while actively using illicit substances and having recently been incarcerated. She delivered two days later, continued with STEPP's postpartum group, and now has custody of her child. She has since completed peer support training and is enrolled at Columbus State Community College, working toward becoming a substance abuse counselor and expunging her felony. In 2021, the STEPP clinic expanded to be able to care for patients up to one year postpartum with an aim to integrate support persons and families in the MOUD treatment and prenatal care already provided for pregnant and postpartum patients with OUD. Data suggests that within the first year, postpartum maternal substance use contributes to an increased rate of pregnancy-associated maternal deaths and infant mortality. Among the major causes of infant mortality in drug-exposed infants is low birth weight, prematurity, birth defects, sudden infant death syndrome, sleep-related deaths and child abuse. Death from opioid overdose represents 11% to 20% of maternal mortality. The most critical time for pregnancy-associated opioid overdose is the postpartum period, specifically 6-12 months after delivery. By expanding the review of pregnancy-associated deaths in Illinois to include violent deaths, homicide and suicide, substance-use related deaths were found to comprise more than 25% of maternal deaths within the first year postpartum. These combined causes were responsible for more deaths than any single obstetric cause, and the majority of deaths occurred in the late postpartum period. The postpartum period is a particularly vulnerable time for women with OUD and their children due to the increased stress, which leads to recidivism and increased risk for maternal death due to overdose. Increased stress from maintaining treatment for OUD compounded by the physical and behavioral response of the drug-exposed infant can have a destabilizing effect on mother-infant bonding and the family unit. In expanding the program, STEPP provides an additional evening session to allow for increased participation from patients' partners and families. A boxed meal and valet parking eliminate additional barriers to participation. This session provides education and support for the entire family unit.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 31Columbus and Franklin County Addiction Plan The Franklin County hospital systems are working together to implement a set of strategies assigned to them under the Columbus and Franklin County Addiction Plan. This plan was developed by ADAMH Franklin County and is supported by the Columbus mayor, City Council and County Commissioners as the community plan to address and combat the opioid crisis. The Central Ohio Hospital Council is working to implement the activities assigned to the hospital systems under the Action Plan. Representatives from all four hospital systems also present opioid overdose education and prevention information at events held throughout the community. What We Will Do Expand use of patient-reported outcomes in clinical decision-making throughout a variety of programs and across the continuum of behavioral health care. Expand access to care by utilizing telehealth and growing outpatient options. Open a residential addiction treatment program at Talbot Hall, offering a 30- day stay to help patients achieve stabilization before transitioning to outpatientservices. Expand the number of peer supporters employed by the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 32 Maternal and Infant Wellness Specific indicators include: Infant mortality Maternal pre-pregnancy health Progress has been made to reduce infant mortality in Franklin County. The work of CelebrateOne, Ohio Better Birth Outcomes (OBBO) and a host of community partners has resulted in Franklin County achieving its lowest infant mortality rate (IMR) in recent history (6.7 per 1,000 live births in 2020). But even at this level, the IMR is too high. Nationally, Columbus ranks 43rd of the 50 largest U.S. cities on infant mortality. Ohio ranks 40 out of the 50 states. In 2020, CelebrateOne and Columbus Public Health reported 17,495 babies born in Franklin County in 2020; 117 died before reaching their first birthday, representing 41 fewer deaths than in 2014. Local and national reductions in white infant mortality have far outpaced the reduction of Black infant mortality. The Franklin County 2020 Black IMR of 11.6 is nearly three times higher than the 2020 white IMR of 4.1. Since the start of this initiative, the white IMR decreased by 28% compared to the Black IMR, which has seen a 22% reduction since 2014. The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center is tackling this problem from multiple angles, using research, treatment programs and community outreach to create a better future for all pregnancies and babies, but especially to reduce those disparities. Moms2B Remains National Model for Improving Prenatal Care It began in a church basement in 2010, with two pregnant moms looking for guidance, and two women who dreamed of a way to keep babies alive in Columbus neighborhoods where so many were dying before their first birthdays. Moms2B has since helped more than 3,400 parents, about half of whom learned of the weekly program through previous participants. Moms2B is a one-of-a-kind Ohio State Wexner Medical Center program to reduce infant mortality rates, eliminate disparities in maternal and infant health and address the social determinants of health that affect pregnancy and babyhood. In Ohio, Moms2B's success has made it the blueprint for reaching those goals. In 2020, the program celebrated its 10th anniversary by publishing new research that shows quantitatively how Moms2B leads to a reduction in adverse pregnancy outcomes in communities disproportionately affected by public health issues. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 33In church halls, at Ohio State East Hospital and at Mount Carmel's Center for Healthy Living, parents in eight high-risk neighborhoods see a multidisciplinary team of health professionals each week. The health care workers follow mothers from pregnancy through their babies' first year. Moms2B provides them with access to portable play yards, healthy meals and other necessities, as well as consistent education about prenatal care, safe sleep, nutrition, smoking cessation, breastfeeding and reproductive health. Postpartum moms receive a home visit from a Mount Carmel Welcome Home nurse and are connected with patient-centered care teams and parenting groups. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Moms2B went virtual with its educational sessions offered through Zoom while continuing check-ins with mothers and connecting them with necessary resources. The program also expanded virtually during the pandemic and began serving mothers living in Dayton/Montgomery County, at the request of Governor Mike DeWine. Maternal Fetal Medicine Outpatient Care East Expansion The Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center has exceptional clinicians, researchers and educators. Services include providing care for people with complicated or high-risk pregnancies, with outpatient and inpatient management as well as consultation for patients referred by other obstetrical providers for ongoing prenatal care or pre-conception counseling, and prenatal imaging and diagnostic testing. Recently, Maternal Fetal Medicine expanded to Outpatient Care East. The goal in this expansion is to reduce preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation and infant mortality in the first year of life for the Near East Side of Columbus by increasing access to general obstetrical and subspecialty maternal fetal medicine care at the Outpatient Care East ambulatory location. In 2014, the Kirwan Institute identified hot spots within the county that had the highest infant mortality rates per square mile. The Near East Side, which surrounds East Hospital, had the second highest infant mortality rate within the county \u2014 18.4 deaths per 1,000 live births. This rate is three times higher than the national average. In addition, over 18% of pregnant women delivered preterm, which is more than 50% higher than the national average. Among the women living on the Near East Side who delivered during the time of the study, 53.4% lived in poverty, 66.9% received Medicaid and 47.3% reported that no one within the household had a vehicle. As maternal stress and poverty are important factors that increase the risk of preterm delivery, efforts to reduce preterm birth rates in areas such as the Near East Side must also address these concerns.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 34Access to high-quality obstetric care is an important first step in improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. Early care in the first trimester allows the identification and management of pre-existing maternal medical problems and pregnancy specific complications to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth. This project involved the development of a comprehensive clinical infrastructure that can address all the prenatal and wraparound services needs of the Near East Side community. As volume continues to increase, the goal is to operate an obstetric clinic five days a week with adequate support staff to address social service needs. Services offered include: General obstetric clinic staffed by advanced practice nurses from The Ohio State University College of Nursing Obstetric clinic for high-risk patients staff ed by maternal fetal medicine physicians and advanced practice nurses Same-day appointments for patients with urgent gynecologic or early pregnancy concerns Prenatal diagnostic imaging services Gynecologic care Gender-affirming care Multimodal Maternal Infant Perinatal Outpatient Delivery System (MOMI PODS) MOMI PODS integrates a multimodal health engagement system (incorporating home visits, mobile health and telehealth) into traditional outpatient care models to provide high-quality primary and postpartum care to both the mother and child in the critical first 1,000 days after delivery, specifically to those with high-risk conditions or those who have not attended scheduled appointments. It builds upon the mom-baby dyad pilot program that focused on moms with gestational diabetes. Quality health care in the first 1,000 days dramatically improves lifelong health and social outcomes. Medicaid, covering pregnancies and babies, provides critical access to postpartum and early childhood health care. Yet, many high-risk, low-income families face major barriers that impede access. MOMI PODS creatively tailors care to overcome barriers, increase access and improve long-term outcomes.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 35Primary care supported by MOMI PODS can help increase access to those who most need preventive care, yet are least likely to engage it. The MOMI PODS focused care for vulnerable patients in the first 1,000 days improves outcomes like postpartum visit completion, immunization, developmental screening, obesity prevention and other preventive or chronic disease management. McCampbell Outpatient Care Ob/Gyn Clinic The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center's McCampbell Outpatient Care clinic offers care to some of our highest risk populations, including those who attend STEPP and participate in our McCampbell Fourth Trimester Group. The teaching clinic averages 2,000 patients per month. The Wexner Medical Center's home visiting program, in collaboration with Nationwide Children's Hospital, also operates out of McCampbell. Nurses and social workers discuss the option of home visits during new obstetric visits and at the 24-week visit. Our home visitors include two nurses who have been trained by Nurse Family Partnership. Beginning in summer 2022, the Wexner Medical Center plans to double the number of home visiting nurses, which will allow for more patients to be able to participate in the program. Clinic initiatives include: Increasing community referrals to oHome Visiting oMoms2B oBaby and Me Tobacco Free at Columbus Public Health Improve breastfeeding rates (McCampbell Fourth Trimester Group) Improve blood pressure monitoring through blood pressure cuff dispensing, which launched in September 2021 Increase maternal understanding of marijuana Complete Pregnancy Risk Assessment Forms and initiate progesterone treatment in patients at risk for spontaneous preterm birth The Fourth Trimester Group Clinic The Fourth Trimester Group Clinic at McCampbell Outpatient Care is a family-centered approach to increasing breastfeeding rates among high-risk mothers in our Medicaid population, investing in the short- and long-term health of this vulnerable population during a critical window of time. The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 36The benefits of breastfeeding and risks of not breastfeeding for both women and their infants are well established. Fourth Trimester Group Clinic (FTGC) at McCampbell is an effort to improve breastfeeding rates and reduce racial disparity in vulnerable high-risk mothers and their infants in our community, with an overarching goal to improve their short- and long-term health. Staff are engaging in an education campaign that will increase the knowledge and skills for inpatient and outpatient nursing and physician staff, with a specific focus on the benefits of breastfeeding for both mothers and infants as well as practical advice and tips for breastfeeding success. We are partnering with The Milk Mission, a Columbus-based initiative to train Black women to become certified lactation instructors. The Milk Mission is unique in addressing social determinates of health in addition to the biology and physiology of lactation. Moreover, we follow the Institute for the Advancement of Breastfeeding and Lactation Education's outpatient Breastfeeding Champion course. The FTGC visit addresses several key needs of the recently discharged high-risk mother and child. First, a pediatrician provides a welcome and informational message, and then each mother and her infant are seen individually for private visits. Infants are examined and weighed. Testing for jaundice is available on site and provided as needed. This infant component of the FTGC visit serves in lieu of the first pediatrician visit, and the results from the visit are sent to the selected pediatrician for appropriate infant follow-up. For the maternal component of the FTGC visit, mothers are screened for postpartum depression and have wound incision checks as indicated. Physicians are available to perform breast exams as needed. Social work support is available as needed to ensure the mom-baby dyad is returning to a safe environment with basic housing and food needs met. Finally, lactation support is offered within a group setting and with individual instruction as needed. Mothers and infants who require ongoing International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners (IBLC) evaluation and support are referred to our specialists at the Upper Arlington location. Substance Abuse Treatment, Education and Prevention Program For expectant parents, substance abuse disorders can further complicate pregnancies that may already be at risk based on other social determinants. To have pregnancies that produce healthy, full-term babies, these patients need specialized care to overcome addiction. Through an innovative clinic called Substance Abuse Treatment, Education and Prevention Program (STEPP), the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center maternal fetal medicine specialists are increasing the odds for those babies to live beyond their first birthday. This past year has seen an expansion of services for women and their infants through the first year postpartum. See page X [in Behavioral Health section] for more information.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 37Women's Behavioral Health Partners With Ob/Gyn Providers Women's Behavioral Health (WBH) at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center is a multidisciplinary academic center of excellence providing care to women experiencing stress or stress-related illness during life events that are unique to women. We provide women with state-of-the-art care for mood and anxiety disorders, sexual health, substance use disorders and stress, with a special emphasis on pregnancy, the postpartum period, gynecologic and breast cancers, menopause and the menstrual cycle. WBH has established a partnership with the STEPP clinic to increase patients' access to psychiatric and behavioral health care services. This colocated provision of treatment includes individual and group psychotherapy as well as access to psychiatric assessments and medication management for pregnant and postpartum women receiving treatment for substance use disorder. WBH also has partnered with Moms2B with support from Aetna Medicaid to deliver mental and behavioral health care services to Moms2B mothers. The enhanced model of care includes three components: Implementation of a postpartum depression and anxiety prevention program Postpartum triage of mothers with mild-to-moderate mood and anxiety disorders to virtual psychotherapy with a dedicated provider Triage and referral for mothers with serious psychiatric comorbidities for individual treatment within WBH or the community Combining clinical care with clinical and basic science research provides WBH patients with access to the latest information about the safest and most effective treatments available during these periods of greatest vulnerability. ACHIEVE: Successfully Achieving Glycemic Control During Pregnancy Type 2 diabetes in pregnancy increases the risk of adverse outcomes for both mother and infant. Over one in three infants born to individuals with type 2 diabetes will experience an adverse outcome, including large for gestational age at birth, preterm birth, birth trauma, neonatal hypoglycemia and stillbirth. Strict maternal glycemic control throughout pregnancy is key to optimizing perinatal outcomes. Glycemic control can be difficult to achieve, and requires a multimodal approach, including insulin, vigilant glucose monitoring, lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise) and team-based prenatal care.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 38Medicaid-enrolled pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes are a high-risk vulnerable population who experience nonmedical social needs that limit their ability to achieve glycemic control. These barriers include lack of reliable transportation to attend prenatal visits, access to resources to engage in diet and exercise changes and convenient methods to log self-monitored glucose values and adjust insulin dosing. A multifaceted provider-patient-based approach with proven strategies to improve glycemic control is needed. ACHIEVE is a multicomponent theory- and evidence-based intervention that includes a mobile health app, provider dashboard, continuous glucose monitoring and care team coaching for medical and social needs. ACHIEVE empowers Medicaid-enrolled pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes and their providers to achieve and maintain glycemic control and access to timely diabetes care, patient education and support. This project will begin in summer 2022. Training for Providers Virtual Telehealth Delivery Training for Women's Health Providers seeks to help women's health providers give better care to patients who cannot easily access early prenatal and specialty care. The project, which began sessions in September 2020, takes women's health providers through simulations to learn efficient workflow management, co-management, virtual patient assessment and other fundamentals of telehealth. The scenarios use standardized patients, or actors, which include a patient with limited English proficiency working through an interpreter, and a patient who is in the country illegally. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 92% of obstetric providers in Ohio had not used telehealth, but now, at least 77% of them use it regularly. A second Ohio Department of Health-funded program, Obstetric Emergency Simulation Training for Emergency Medicine Providers, is designed for emergency medicine physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses and EMT/EMS. The program, which began its first trainings in August 2020, puts participants through virtual simulations to improve recognition, treatment and management of obstetric emergencies including hypertensive emergencies, postpartum hemorrhage and cardiomyopathy. One training involves practicing simulations themselves, but the second training utilizes a train-the-trainer model to offer emergency medicine physicians and nurse educators the tools to facilitate their own low-cost obstetric emergency simulations and teach others at their home hospitals. In Ohio, about one-third of maternal deaths occur in the postpartum period and 23% of maternal deaths occur in emergency departments. Emergency departments also see a significant number of pregnant and postpartum patients for complaints both related to the pregnancy and not related to the pregnancy. While 98% of Ohio hospitals have reported conducting simulation drills for obstetric emergencies, 100% of those drills involved labor and delivery or postpartum staff \u2014 but only 30% involved emergency department staff.The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 39Community Partnerships In 2014, the Greater Columbus Infant Mortality (GCIM) Task Force, comprising community and business leaders, released a set of strategies to reduce Franklin County's high infant mortality rate. The strategies were assigned to lead entities, which were charged with successfully implementing the strategies and ensuring progress is made. Strategies to be implemented by the hospital systems were assigned to the Central Ohio Hospital Council (COHC) including: Safe Sleep EducationSince September 2016, all Franklin County birthing hospitals are showing a video to women and families before discharge highlighting the importance of safe sleep practices (ABC: Alone, on the Back, in a Crib). The video also educates parents on breastfeeding, tobacco use in the home and on things parents can do to calm crying babies to reduce shaken baby syndrome. Franklin County hospitals conduct quarterly internal audits to monitor the number of families who see the video before discharge. In addition, the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center distributes sleep sacks to infants before discharge. Sleep-related deaths tend to increase during the cold months due to blankets and other warm items being placed in cribs. Medical Legal Partnership Since 2017, pregnant women who receive care in hospital prenatal clinics are screened to assess if they have a legal issue that needs to be addressed. If a legal need is identified, the woman is referred to the Columbus Legal Aid Society, which helps to resolve the legal issues. The goal of the initiative, which is overseen by the Ohio Better Birth Outcomes collaborative, is to improve the health of pregnant women by addressing social conditions, such as housing, benefits and job-related issues, that could result in a negative pregnancy outcome. Tobacco CessationFranklin County birthing hospitals and prenatal clinics are identifying women who currently smoke tobacco and referring them to Columbus Public Health for cessation counseling. Under the program, staff ask patients about their smoking status, advise them on the impact of tobacco on the mother and infant and assess the patient's willingness to make a quit attempt. Women and in-home partners who are likely to make a quit attempt are referred to Columbus Public Health for assistance. Very Low Birth Weight InfantsSince 2017, the three adult hospital systems have implemented policies to ensure that mothers at risk of delivering a very low birth weight (VLBW) infant deliver at a facility with higher volumes of VLBW deliveries. Ohio State's University Hospital is such a facility. This work comes from a recommendation of the GCIM Task Force, which considered national studies showing that infants delivered at less than 1,500 grams The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center I HealthMap 2022 Implementation Strategy 40are more likely to survive if they are born in hospitals with higher volumes of VLBW infants. Maternal Levels of CareIn 2019, Ohio instituted a system of assigning maternal levels of care to complement the neonatal levels of care already in operation. Maternal licensure at the Ohio Department of Health has awarded Ohio State's University Hospital a maternal level IV and neonatal level III. These are the highest levels possible outside of a dedicated children's hospital for the neonatal level. What We Will Do Expand the number of patients able to participate in the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center's home visiting program by doubling our home visiting nurses. Increase referrals to the Mid-Ohio Farmacy for our eligible pregnant moms. Partner with Ohio Better Birth Outcomes and CelebrateOne to embed community health workers into the McCampbell Outpatient Care clinic. Using data and the help of CelebrateOne, assess the current locations of Moms2B with the goal to provide this valuable resource to the areas that need it most. Continue to provide trainings to reduce implicit bias in obstetric care, and partner with Ohio Better Birth Outcomes and CelebrateOne to decrease racial disparities in infant mortality. "}
