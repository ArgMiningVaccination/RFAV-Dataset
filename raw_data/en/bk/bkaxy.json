Interest in this symposium is growing explosively, and the symposium is rapidly becoming a calendar event for the Knoxville cam-puses of UT, expanding this year to include the UT Space Institute in Tullahoma. Comparative and Experimental Medicine (CEM), a graduate program that is shared by the College of Veterinary Medicine and the Graduate School of Medicine, initiated this symposium in 2007 as an event to showcase the research of students and new investigators in their program. In 2008, the symposium was opened to participants throughout the Knoxville campuses, and there was a four-fold increase in presentations with representation from 19 different UT departments and programs. For the second year, the Center for Public Health has teamed with CEM to produce a joint Comparative & Experimental Medi-cine and Public Health Research Symposium hosting an even larger group of scientists including 86 presenters represent-ing 20 different UT departments and programs. The Comparative & Experimental Medicine and Public Health Research Symposium has gained both a reputation and recogni- tion for providing an excellent venue for students and new investigators to gain experience presenting their work as oral presentations. In addition, the gathering of UT investigators with related and varying interests provides opportunities for the creation of new ideas, collaborations, and networking that will enhance health-related research at the Knoxville campuses of the university. The joint sponsorship of the symposium by the College of Veterinary Medicine, the UT Center for Public Health, the Graduate School of Medicine, Tennessee AgResearch, the UT Graduate School, and the UT Knoxville Office of Research is unprecedented and signi-fies both a shared recognition of the need for such a sympo-sium and a cooperative spirit in bringing this exciting event to reality. Lastly, it is important to mention that the speakers to be presenting their research are an incredibly diverse group, and this international diversity is celebrated on the program's cover with the inclusion of the word collaborate in eight different languages, which are spoken by one or more of the presenters. We are happy to welcome all participants and attendees and hope the experience will be as positive as it is promising.

Blair Professor, Division of Health Aspects of Physical Activity, Department of Exercise Science, University of South Carolina \"Exercise is Medicine\" Monday Keynote Address Steven N. Blair, PED, is a professor at the Arnold School of Public Health at the University of South Carolina. Dr. Blair is a fellow in the American College of Epidemiology, Society for Behavioral Medicine, American College of Sports Medicine, American Heart Association, and American Academy of Kine - siology and Physical Education. He is the recipient of three honorary doctoral degrees from universities in Belgium, the United States, and the United King-dom. His many awards from professional associations include the Honor Award from the American College of Sports Medicine and the Robert Levy Lecture and Population Science Research Awards from the American Heart Association. In addition, Dr. Blair was granted a MERIT Award from the National Institutes of Health and is one of the few individuals outside the US Public Health Service to be awarded the Surgeon General's Medallion. He has delivered lectures to medical, scientific, and lay groups in 48 states and 30 countries, relaying his research focuses on the associations between lifestyle and health, with a specific emphasis on exercise, physical fitness, body composition, and chronic disease. With over 450 papers and chapters in the scientific literature, Dr. Blair is one of the most highly cited exercise scientists, having over 24,000 citations to his work. He was also the Senior Scientific Editor for the US Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activity and Health. Dr. KristinaThiagarajan's research focuses on psychosocial and molecular factors that affect metabolic control in adults with type 1 diabetes and the effects of cyclosporine on the immunological quality of breast milk. Much of Dr. Thiagarajan's earlier work has been focused on specific psychosocial factors (acceptance of diabetes, social support, stress, self-management and coping styles) and how they can affect health outcomes (metabolic control and quality of life) of adults with type 1 diabetes. She completed her PhD and a three-year post-doc at the University of Washington and spent six years investigating molecular immunogenetics in colostrum from women receiving immunosuppressive agents. She spent one and a half years conducting this research at the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, MD. Dr. Thiagarajan also previously served as an assistant professor for the College of Nursing at the University of Tennessee (UT), Knoxville. Besides currently serving as the NIH Program Manger for ORNL, Department of Energy, she is an adjunct research professor with the University of Washington, School of Nursing and UT, Knoxville. She is also a faculty member of the UT Obesity Research Center and an advisory committee member for PEER-Program for Excellence & Equity in Research at UT. Dr. Kristina Thiagarajan NIH Program Manager, Biological and Environmental Sciences DirectorateOak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) \"Post-doctoral Opportunities\" Monday Featured Speaker 11 Arnold I. Caplan, PhD Professor of Biology; Director, Skeletal Research Center, Case Western Reserve University \"Adult Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Their Use in Various Therapies\" Tuesday Keynote Address Dr. Arnold Caplan has conducted skeletal research at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH, for over 40 years. In 2007, he received the Genzyme Lifetime Achievement Award given by the International Cartilage Repair Society and was honored by the Orthopaedic Research Society with the Marshall Urist Award for Excellence in Tissue Regeneration Research in 1999. Caplan is also the founder of four commercial ventures focused on pre-clinical discovery and therapeutic development in bone and central nervous system biologies. Caplan has published over 300 scientific articles, holds 19 patents, and has been an an invited speaker at locales too numerous to mention. He has been funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and the American Cancer Society, among others. The emphasis of Caplan's studies is to develop and refine the technology necessary to isolate the rare mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). The MSC gives rise to bone-forming cells, cartilage-forming cells and cells of tendon, ligament fat, and dermis, as well as various connective tissues including the stroma of marrow. Following isolation and by mitotically expanding their numbers in culture, he anticipates being able to drive these cells down specific and different developmental pathways with emphasis on cartilage and bone. The experimental approaches use both morphogenesis and organogenesis coupled with the control of developmental lineage progression as controlled by potent growth factors. His already-successful preliminary studies integrate both basic and clinical science to more effectively translate these basic science findings into new, innovative human health care protocols of using tissue engineering to repair skeletal tissues.Featured Speakers Dr. Asha Kallianpur Assistant Professor, Institute for Medicine and Public Health Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center \"Progress and Promise in Iron Biology: A Balanced Perspective\" Tuesday Plenary Address Asha Kallianpur, MD, MPH, has been with Vanderbilt University since 2002 in both the Center for Health Services Research and the Institute for Medicine and Public Health. Previously, she was a staff physician and instructor of medicine at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Nashville. Kallianpur completed her BA and MD at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and her MPH at Vanderbilt University. She completed a residency in internal medicine and a fellowship in hema - tology at Vanderbilt prior to joining the faculty there. Kallianpur's work is currently supported by four separate grants, including three from NIH and one from Vander - bilt University. Her research emphasis includes cancer risk and its relationship to the diet and genetics, as well as the relationship of dietary iron and fatty acid intake to inflammation and oxidative injury. Her interest in iron biology led her to study the impact of iron stores on drug-induced peripheral neuropathy and inflamma - tion in HIV/AIDS, and iron, oxidant stress, and related genetic polymorphisms in breast cancer. Since 2009, she has been a reviewer for an NIH special emphasis panel of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. In addition, Kallianpur is a member of the National Cancer Institute Cancer Cohort Consortium and Endometrial Cancer Consortium. 12 Sam Venable Storyteller, humorist, and columnist for the Knoxville News Sentinel \"Warning! Living Can Be Hazardous to Your Health\" Featured After-dinner Address Sam Venable has been a beloved columnist for the Knoxville News Sentinel since 1985, giving readers healthy doses of East Tennessee humor and \"you-gotta-laugh-to-keep-from-cryin'\" anecdotes about life in general. In the 15 years before that, he served as the newspaper's outdoors editor. Sam is a native of Knoxville and a graduate of the University of Tennessee with a degree in journalism and minor studies in forestry and wildlife management. Winner of more than three dozen national and regional writing awards, Sam has also been widely published outside the newspaper field. He sold his first magazine article as a senior in college and since has compiled more than 150 periodical credits to his record. Sam is the author of ten books, the most recent being Someday I May Find Honest Work: A Newspaper Humorist's Life, and has been a contributing author for numerous other books, including writing the new introduction for Carson Brewer's classic collection about the Great Smokies, A Wonderment of Mountains. In addition, he has been the subject of articles in such publications as Southern Living magazine and \"The Encyclopedia of Appalachia.\" In recent years, Sam has become increasingly popular on the stand-up comedy circuit. He delivers his bizarre look at life on a wide variety of topics\u2014everything from how to speak \"hillbillyese,\" to the insanity of everpresent warning labels, as well as coping with the nutty life in which we live, and the perils of growing older. In his spare time, Sam enjoys hunting, fishing, hiking, and swimming.

Organizational Cultural Competence of Post-Secondary Health-Related Academic Units Laura Dotson, Betsy Haughton Department of Nutrition, Public Health Program According to the US Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities, one way to eliminate health disparities is by providing educational opportunities in cultural competence to health care professionals. Quality health care professionals graduate from accredited universities or colleges. Therefore, academic units have a unique opportunity to provide cross-cultural training. Academic units can institute organizational cultural competence in terms of policies, programs, and activities. Organizational cultural competence in a post-secondary, health-related academic unit refers to the teaching, research, service, outreach, administrative and personnel policies, and practices that provide students the cultural competencies needed to work in health care delivery systems. This study was designed to test the Krause model's domains and criteria statements for organizational cultural competence of post-secondary, health-related academic units. The Krause model was developed by an expert panel who provided input on domains and criteria statements that are important and relevant for academia. To test this model, administrators and tenured/tenure-track faculty of post-secondary, health-related academic units from family medicine, nursing, psychology, public health, and nutrition will rate the essentialness of the Krause model's criteria statements through an online survey. Principle component analysis with varimax rotation will be performed to identify factors with highly correlated items. Factor loadings above 0.40 will be considered. Final factors will be reviewed to determine their respective common themes. 2. Youth Can! Grow Healthy! Andrew Carberry, Marsha Spence Department of Nutrition This pilot project was conducted to test the effectiveness of an after-school, school garden program combined with a youth development curriculum involving participa - tory action research in improving the fruit and vegetable consumption of 4 th and 5th graders. The main outcome of interest was fruit and vegetable consumption, which was hypothesized to increase along with self-efficacy to consume fruits and vegetables. The after-school program was implemented in collaboration with University of Tennessee Extension and an urban demonstration farm, Beardsley Community Farm. An intervention school was chosen for the combined after-school garden program and youth-based participatory action research intervention, and a comparison school was chosen for the after-school garden program. Data were collected at 2 times (pre-post) and included anthropometric data as well as survey mea - sures of fruit and vegetable consumption, preferences for fruits and vegetables, self-efficacy to consume fruits and vegetables, self-efficacy to garden and school connected - ness. Preliminary data showed that 72% (8/11) students in the program had a BMI above the 95 th percentile. Prelimi - nary results from a food frequency questionnaire showed that 53% of students ate vegetables one or fewer times and 61% ate fruit one or fewer times. The results of this pilot project are important to the development of school gardens that are as effective in changing students' dietary behaviors as they are in changing their preferences. The areas of youth development and youth-based participa - tory action research can inform and improve future school garden interventions. 3. Investigation of Geographic Access to Emergency Stroke and Heart Attack Care in Middle Tennessee Doreen Busingye, Agricola Odoi Department of Comparative Medicine (Busingye, Odoi), Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program (Busingye) Heart disease and stroke are, respectively, the first and third leading causes of death in Tennessee and the United States. These conditions require time-sensitive treatments, and therefore timely access to care is critical to minimize complications and death. The objective of this study was to investigate the timeliness of access to emergency care for stroke and heart attack patients in middle Tennessee. Street network and hospital data were obtained from Streetmap USA and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Organizations, respectively, and used in network analysis. Network Analysis, implemented in ArcGIS, was used to compute travel time from different neighborhoods to the nearest emergency room (ER), cardiac and stroke centers. Neighborhoods within 30, 60 and 90 minutes driving time to the nearest ER, cardiac and stroke centers were identified. Population data were obtained from the 2000 census and used to estimate the percentage of population with/without access. Most (96.2%) of the population had access to an Public Health15 Public HealthER within 30 minutes. Additionally, 73%, 26% and 1% of the population had access to a cardiac center within 30 minutes, 30-60 minutes, 0-90 minutes, respectively. In contrast, only 42.6% of the population had access to stroke centers within 30 minutes, and 9.2% had no access within 90 minutes. Most of the population lacking access were in the rural north. The identified geographic disparities is vital for guiding planning and policy decisions aimed at reducing/eliminating health disparities at the neighborhood level with the view to improving health of the entire population. 4. From 911 to ER: Analysis of Ambulance Transport of Stroke and Heart Attack Patients Ashley S. Pedigo, Lisa Escalante, Tim Aldrich, Agricola Odoi Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program (Pedigo), Physician Assistant Studies, South College (Escalante), Department of Epidemiology, East Tennessee State University (Aldrich), Department of Comparative Medicine (Odoi) Stroke and heart attack are serious health conditions with specific time-sensitive treatments. Patients who use Emergency Medical Services (EMS) transport have higher odds of receiving treatments within the medically recommended times. Our goal was to investigate the use of EMS in East Tennessee (TN) and describe ambulance transport time for stroke and heart attack patients. Paper or electronic records of suspected stroke and heart attack 911 calls and ambulance dispatches made from 2006 to 2009 were obtained from EMS in East TN. Confidential patient data were removed from the records before being released to the investigators. Data manipulations and analyses were conducted in SAS 9.2. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to investigate use of EMS, patient-related information (e.g. dispatch reasons and choice of hospital), as well as ambulance travel time to the patient location, time spent on scene, and travel time to the hospital. Preliminary results show that the travel times to patients were relatively short while the time from scene to the hospital tended to be longer, likely due to the distribution of ambulances throughout the community. The time spent on scene had more variability than other time components. The majority of heart attack patients were transported to a cardiac specialty hospital. In contrast, fewer stroke patients were transported to a stroke specialty hospital. In conclusion, EMS provides rapid emergency care and has a critical role in improving outcomes for stroke and heart attack patients in East TN.5. A Novel Processing Approach for the Inactivation of Salmonella enteritidis in vitro with Potential Applications for Liquid Whole Eggs Chayapa Techathuvanan , Doris Helen D'Souza Department of Food Science and Technology High intensity ultrasound (HIU) is a non-thermal inactivation technology that is attractive to the food industry. HIU can inactivate microbes and yet maintain the nutritional value, sensory quality, and freshness of foods. Research is ongoing to determine the feasibility of this technology for food applications. Frequent outbreaks of salmonellosis are linked to liquid whole egg (LWE) products associated with Salmonella enteritidis contamination. These outbreaks result in significant socio-economic impacts on industry and public health. This study aimed to investigate the effect of HIU on S. enteritidis inactivation in pure culture and in LWE. Overnight S. enteritidis and LWE spiked with S. enteritidis were treated with 20 kHz of HIU for 0, 1, 5, 10 and 30 minutes in a temperature-controlled system at < 20\u00b0C. Samples were enumerated by spread plating on XLT4 agar at each time point. S. enteritidis was significantly reduced by 2.2 and 2.3 log CFU/ml after 30-minutes HIU treatment in pure culture and LWE, respectively (p<0.05). After 5 and 10-minute treatment, S. enteritidis reductions of 1.0 and 1.3 log CFU/ml in pure culture, and 1.4 log CFU/ml in LWE for both times, respectively, were obtained (p<0.05). Even at 1 minute, HIU showed inactivation of 0.6 log CFU/ml in pure culture (p<0.05); however, no reduction was observed in LWE. HIU shows promise for Salmonella control in LWE and potentially for other liquid food products as an alternative pasteurization method in hurdle approaches. 6. Second Cut of the Rough: Revisiting the Site of an Ehrlichiosis Outbreak in Middle Tennessee Jessica Harmon, Cathy Scott, Graham Hickling, Carl Jones Entomology and Plant Pathology (Harmon, Jones), Center for Wildlife Health (Harmon, Scott, Hickling) In 1993, 4 residents of a retirement community in a forest - ed area of middle Tennessee were hospitalized with symp - toms of ehrlichiosis. This case cluster triggered a Centers 16for Disease Control outbreak investigation, reported by Standaert and Dawson (1995). Anecdotal reports indicate that residents of the outbreak community have perceived resurgence in tick-related infections in recent years. The motivation for this study was to revisit the retirement community 15 years later and assess the risk that ticks and their associated pathogens may still pose for residents. In a pilot assay of 16 adult Amblyomma americanum ticks, we detected 1 tick positive for Ehrlichia (6%) and 3 ticks positive for E. ewingii (19%). The observed rate of infection is well over the established 2-5% infec - tion rate for an endemic area, suggesting that this com - munity represents a hot spot for Ehrlichia infection. Additionally, the detection of E. ewingii in sampled ticks indicates that serum test results of community residents need to be interpreted with caution, as E. chaffeensis and E. ewingii antibodies are likely cross-reactive. We specu - late that other pathogens could also be contributing to tick-associated illness in this community. For example, Rickettsia amblyommii was found in a high proportion of ticks, but its potential for pathogenicity is unclear. 7. Application of Spatial Analysis, at Three Geographic Scales, to Detect Clustering of Humans with Campylobacteriosis Reported to the Tennessee Department of Health Jennifer Weisent , Agricola Odoi, Barton Rohrbach Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program (Weisent), Department of Comparative Medicine (Odoi, Rohrbach) Campylobacteriosis is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States and many other de - veloped countries. The objective of this study is to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to investigate the spatial distribution of Campylobacter infection in the state of Tennessee at 3 levels: county subdivision, zipcode and census tract. The study aims to test for the existence of disease clusters and determine whether differences exist in the risk of Campylobacter infection between geographical levels. Population data were obtained from the U.S. Cen - sus Bureau, and distribution of Campylobacter cases was supplied by the Tennessee Department of Health. Disease data were aggregated at 3 levels and stratified by age and gender. Statistical techniques for spatial clustering were then applied for the analysis. Study results are intended to provide information that will enable public health person - nel to focus disease prevention and control strategies on subpopulations based on geography to improve the cost effectiveness of disease control. Results were pending at the time of publication. 8. Prevention of Pancreatic Cancer by Inhibition of Beta-adrenergic Signaling Hussein A. Al-Wadei, ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the leading causes of cancer deaths and is unresponsive to ex - isting therapy. Smoking and alcohol-induced pancreatitis are among the risk factors for PDAC. We have previously reported that beta-adrenergic receptors (-ARs) stimulate the proliferation and migration of human PDAC cells in vitro via cAMP-dependent signaling and that the nicotine-derived nitrosamine NNK activates this pathway directly in vitro while additionally stimulating the release of noradrenaline/adrenaline by binding to 7 nicotinic ace - tylcholine receptors in hamsters. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the -AR antagonist propranolol prevents the development of PDAC pancreatitis of pancreatic cells and PDAC cells harvested by laser capture microscopy showed significant upregulation of the 7nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) associated with significant of and increases in EGF and VEGF in PDAC cells of hamsters not treated with propranolol. These effects were reversed by treatment with propranolol. Our data suggest that propranolol may prevent the development of PDAC by blocking cAMP-dependent intracellular signaling, cAMP-dependent release of downregulating 7nAChR via inhibition of cAMP-mediated subunit assembly. Increased cAMP signaling is an important factor that drives the development and progression of PDAC, and the inhibition of cAMP formation is a promising new target for the pre-vention and adjuvant therapy of PDAC. Our current study shows that -aminobutyric acid GABA also blocks the signaling of NNK by inhibiting the activation of adenylyl cyclase. On the other hand, GABA production by these cells was reduced by a single dose of NNK via desensi - tization of 42 nAChR. Supported Health179. Formation of Nicastrin and Aph1 Subcomplex is Necessary for Recruitment of Amyloid Precursor Protein but Not for Interaction with Presenilin Guozhang Mao, Mei-Zhen Cui, Tong Li, Bart De Strooper, Huaxi Xu, Xuemin Xu Department of Pathobiology (Mao, Cui, X Xu), Johns Hop - kins University, Baltimore, MD (Li), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium (De Strooper), Sanford-Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, CA (H Xu) Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that the abnormal accumulation of -amyloid peptide (A) in the brain is a causative event in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is first cleaved by -secretase to produce a membrane-associated C-terminal fragment, CTF. is subsequently cleaved within its transmembrane domain by -secretase to produce the full-length A. Thus, -secretase-mediated processing of APP is a crucial step in the formation of A. In the present study, using knockout cell lines in which some components of the -secretase complex have been eliminated, we determined some aspects of how the multisubunit -secretase complex is assembled and how it interacts with APP. Our data clearly show that, in the absence of Aph1, a major component of the complex, nicastrin (NCT), another major component of the -secretase complex, can be co-immunoprecipitated with presenilin, the catalytic subunit of the -secretase complex, but, under the same condition, the NCT cannot be co-immunoprecipitated with CTF; vice versa, in the absence of NCT, APH1aL can also be co-immunoprecipitated with presenilin, but not CTF. Furthermore, in the presenilin-knockout cells, NCT and APH1aL form a subcomplex that binds CTF with high affinity. These results indicate that presenilin can interact with NCT without the involvement of Aph1, and vice versa, presenilin can interact with Aph1 without the involvement of NCT. However, the presence of both NCT and Aph1 are required for their interaction with the substrate CTF. These results provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of -secretase-mediated APP processing.10. Ponazuril Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Llamas (Lama Following Oral Administration Maria T. Ryman, Tomas Martin- Jimenez, Bernd Meibohm Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences (Prado), Depart - ment of Comparative Medicine (Martin-Jimenez), College of Pharmacy (Ryman, Meibohm) Eimeria macusaniensis is a coccidian parasite that causes severe diarrhea in New World camelids (NWCs). Currently, there are no approved drugs for treating infected NWCs against E. macusaniensis. Thus treatments are empirical and extrapolated from other species. Ponazuril is a triazine coccidial drug related to toltrazuril that has been shown to be effective against different members of the phylum apicomplexa. The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of oral ponazuril in healthy llamas. Ponazuril was administered once orally to 6 llamas (20 mg/kg of body weight), and serum was collected on days 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 49. Serum samples were analyzed by a validated reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay with UV absorbance detection. Ponazuril was readily absorbed by healthy llamas following a single oral dose. The mean elimination half-life, Tmax, Cmax and area under the curve for hours, 84\u00b125.2 hours, 23.6\u00b16.03 mg/L and concentrations ponazuril at 23.60\u00b16.0 \u00b5g/mL at 84 (range 48-120) hours post-administration. Thereafter, plasma concentrations gradually decreased but remained detectable up to 35 days post-administration. In summary, results from this study showed that oral administration of ponazuril to healthy llamas at 20 mg/kg resulted in plasma concentrations that were high enough to be effective against different apicomplexans based on data for other species The effective minimal inhibitory concentration of ponazuril for E. macusaniensis in NWCs is currently unknown. Pharmacology & Pharmacokinetics1811. The Effect of Ketamine on the MACBAR of Sevoflurane in Dogs Lydia Love, Christine Egger, Barton Rohrbach, Sherry Cox, Meredith Hobbs, Thomas Doherty Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences (Love, Doherty), Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences (Egger), Department of Comparative Medicine (Cox, Rohrbach), College of Veterinary Medicine (Hobbs) Our objective was to determine the effect of intravenous ketamine on the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane needed to block autonomic response (MACBAR) to a noxious stimulus in dogs. Six adult dogs (11.2-16.1 kg) were anesthetized twice with sevoflurane 1 week apart, and baseline MACBAR (B-MACBAR) was determined. MACBAR was defined as the mean of the end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations that prevented and allowed an increase (15%) in heart rate or invasive mean arterial pressure in response to a noxious electrical stimulus. Dogs were then randomly given either a low-dose (LDS) or high-dose series (HDS) of ketamine, and treatment MACBAR (T-MACBAR) was determined. The LDS included a loading dose (LD) of 0.5 mg kg-1 and constant rate infusion (CRI) at 6.25 \u00b5g kg-1 minute-1, followed by a second LD (1 and CRI (12.5 \u00b5g kg-1 minute-1). The HDS had an initial kg-1) and CRI (25 \u00b5g kg-1 minute-1) followed by a second LD (3 mg kg-1) and CRI (50 \u00b5g kg-1 minute-1). Data were analyzed with a mixed-model ANOV A and are presented as LSM \u00b1 SEM. The B-MACBAR was not significantly different between treatments. Ketamine at 12.5, 25, and 50 \u00b5g kg-1 minute-1 decreased sevoflurane MACBAR. The percentage change in MACBAR was not correlated with either the log plasma ketamine or norketamine concentration. Ketamine at clinically relevant doses of 12.5, 25, and 50 \u00b5g kg-1 minute-1 decreased sevoflurane MACBAR, although the reduction was neither dose-dependent nor linear. 12. A Comparison of AUC24/MIC Pre- and Post-conversion from Intermittent Infusion Vancomycin to Continuous Infusion Vancomycin Christopher F. Burke, Barbara E. Faircloth, Edwin H. Varnadoe Department of Pharmacy, UT Medical Center Recently published guidelines recommend an AUC24/MIC ratio 400 to achieve clinical effectiveness with vancomycin. To our knowledge, no study has compared intermittent (IIV) to continuous (CIV) infusion vancomycin with regards to attainment of target AUC24/MIC ratio, and as such we designed this study. Most literature describes weight-based dosing of CIV; however, vancomycin peak and trough levels are commonly available at our institution prior to conversion from IIV to CIV . Therefore, we also sought to evaluate whether a pharmacokinetic-based or weight-based approach would more reliably predict CIV dose requirement. IRB approval was obtained before commencement of this retrospective analysis. Adults 18 years old were eligible for inclusion if they received at least 3 doses of IIV followed by conversion to CIV for at least 24 hours. The primary outcome was a comparison of AUC24/MIC ratio before and after conversion from IIV to CIV in patients with a documented gram-positive pathogen. As a secondary analysis, patient-specific pharmacokinetic values (Ke, Vd, CLvanc) were calculated in those with evaluable peak and trough levels while receiving IIV . Several mg/kg/day doses were then compared to pharmacokinetic-based dosing to determine which method more reliably predicted initial plateau level and CIV dose requirement. Results and conclusions were pending at the time of printing. 13. Interscalene Anesthesia for Arthroscopic Shoulder Surgery: Failures and Complications Jonathan S DiRuzzo , Daniel R Bustamante, Roger C Carroll, Carolyn G Snyder, Jerry Epps Department of Anesthesiology, UT Medical Center The purpose of this study is to determine the failure and complication rates for this anesthetic technique at our in - stitution. After IRB approval, we retrospectively reviewed 100 consecutive patients of a single surgeon for whom ar - throscopic shoulder surgery under interscalene block was planned. Records from anesthesia, postanesthesia recov - ery, and surgical follow-up were reviewed; 9 interscalene blocks were judged failures. One conversion to general anesthesia (GA) was judged not to be a block failure as the conversion GA occurred at the request of the surgeon because of a change in surgical plans. Of the 9 cases judged to be failures, 6 were converted to GA after the interscalene block was placed, 2 had repeat blocks (one preoperatively and one immediately postoperatively), and in 1 case the block was aborted when satisfactory nerve stimulation was not obtained. The primary limitation of Pharmacology & Pharmacokinetics19this retrospective review revolves around the definition of a failed block and by implication the definition of a suc - cessful block. As we had no documentation of a detailed evaluation of the blocks based upon specific sensory and motor examination, we used the clinical end points of conversion to GA, performance of a repeat block or any notation that a block was inadequate to define a failure. While these endpoints are clinically relevant, a rigor - ous motor and sensory examination would be preferable. This retrospective review of 100 consecutive interscalene blocks for arthroscopic shoulder surgery, revealed a 9% failure rate, a 4% rate of postoperative complications and 1 immediate complication, systemic local anesthetic toxic - ity. 14. Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability of Carvedilol in Cats April Durtschi, Tomas Martin-Jimenez, Sherry Cox, Rebecca Gompf Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences (Durtchi, Gompf, Bartges), Department of Comparative Medicine non-selective, beta-blocker with ancillary alpha1-blocking and antioxidant may have therapeutic implications for multiple diseases in cats; however, pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of commercially prepared oral carvedilol has not been determined. HPLC for carvedilol measurement in feline plasma was validated and standardization curves created. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of carvedilol was evaluated in 5 apparently healthy male neutered adult cats (average weight of 5 kg) following single dose intravenous (IV) of 0.5 mg/kg and single dose oral administration of 1.6 mg/kg. Concentrations of the active parent compound, carvedilol, were detected in plasma using HPLC analysis. Lower limit of quantification was 5 ng/ml. The mean peak concentration after IV administration of carvedilol was 8639 ng/mL (range, 901-8648), elimination half- life was 2.9 hours (range, 2.0-5.4), and clearance was 0.35 L/hr/kg. The volume of distribution was 1.18 L/hr. After a single oral administration of carvedilol, the time to peak plasma concentration was 60 minutes (range, 30-90 minutes) and the mean residual time was 4.8 hours. The half life was 4.44 hours. Maximal concentration 294 ng/mL, and the mean bioavailability was 15.7% with a median of 9.97% (range, 4.7% to 46%).These data demonstrate a low bioavailability of oral carvedilol and a wide variation in cats. Also, a mean residual time of 4.8 hours suggests a dosing interval of about every 5 hours. Pharmacodynamic studies investigating beta-adrenergic blockade duration may provide a more accurate dosing interval of carvedilol. Also, further studies are needed to assess steady-state and population. 15. Genomic Sequencing of Methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from Canine Pyoderma Laura Eberlein Department of Comparative Medicine Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is the most common bacterium associated with canine bacterial skin infections. Antibiotic resistance in this organism is a growing con- cern in veterinary medicine. For example, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) has risen to 30% at the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine, and resistance to other antibiotics also follows an upward trend. Because of this resistance problem, many antibiotics are now ineffective against S. pseudintermedius infections. Factors such as the overuse of antibiotics and the acquisition of resistance genes have facilitated the spread of MRSP. It has also been sug - gested that using certain combinations of drugs together may increase the likelihood of resistance. Whole genome sequencing of S. pseudintermedius can provide invaluable information in regards to antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the relationship between resistance genes. In this project, sequence information for S. pseudintermedius was determined using Solexa and 454 DNA sequencing tech - nology. Contig assembly software (Lasergene) was used to assemble thousands of sequence fragments containing the millions of bases that make up the bacterial chromo - some. Large portions of the genome are currently assem - bled, but additional sequencing is required to complete the project. Upon preliminary annotation, genes responsible for resistance to tetracycline, beta lactams, flouroquino - lones, bacitracin, and other antibiotics have been found. Investigation of these genes in relation to the complete ge - nome may shed light on resistance mechanisms and help combat the problem of antibiotic resistance in dogs. Bacterial Virulence & Transmission2016. Variation of mecA Expression Among Regional Clones of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Characterization of mec and bla Regulatory Elements Chad Black, Laura Eberlein, Samar Solyman, David Bemis, Stephen Kania Department of Comparative Medicine Regional clones of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) affecting veterinary clinical practice have recently been identified in Europe and North America-multilocus sequence types (MLST) 71 and 68, respectively. One notable difference between the two clones is a deletion in the mec regulatory elements of ST 68. This deletion in analogous methicillin-resistant Staph- ylococcus aureus (MRSA) results in more responsive and greater expression of the mecA encoded penicillin-binding protein 2a, a characteristic associated with community-acquired MRSA lineages. The aim of this study was to characterize mec and bla regulatory apparatuses in MRSP. Twenty wild-type S. pseudintermedius isolates repre - senting the 7 known methicillin-resistant lineages were screened via PCR for the presence of the repressors blaI and mecI and sensors blaR1 and mecR1. The bla and mec operons for each isolate were sequenced and compared for homology between the repressor open-reading frames (ORF), sensor ORFs, and promoter regions. A real-time reverse transcriptase PCR expression assay was developed, validated and applied to 8 isolates analyzing the effect of oxacillin induction on mecA transcript pro - duction. Comparisons of mecA expression induction and volume are made between isolates with a full regulatory complement ( mecI/mecR1 and blaI/blaR1) and those with truncated and/or absent regulatory elements. 17. The Selection of New Gene Candidates for the Improvement of the Current MLST Scheme for Staphylococcus pseudintermedius Samar Solyman, Stephen Kania, David Bemis Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program (Solyman), Department of Comparative Medicine (Kania, Bemis) In order to understand the population genetic structure of the newly emerging methicillin-resistant pathogen Staphy- lococcus pseudintermedius we selected new gene candi -dates to increase the number of genes used in the current multilocus sequence type scheme from 4 genes to 7 genes. S. pseudintermedius is the most common cause of canine pyoderma and occasionally causes zoonotic infections of humans. Twenty different sequence types were identified among the regional S. pseudintermedius isolates examined using the current scheme, and methicillin-resistant isolates were predominantly sequence type 68, which suggests it is a regional clone originated from a single source and is different from clones in the other regions. Increasing the number of genes in the current scheme will increase the discrimination power between genetically-related strains and will provide an insight into the epidemiology of the species. 18. Gene Expression Profile of Bovine Primary Mammary Epithelial Cells Infected with Escherichia coli Associated with Acute or Chronic Bovine Mastitis Oudessa Kerro Dego, Raul Almeida, Douglas Luther, Stephen Oliver Department of Animal Science Acute Escherichia coli mastitis is associated with rapid onset of clinical signs including mammary gland swell - ing and abnormal milk with rapid elimination of bacteria from milk. Some strains of E. coli are associated with chronic mastitis, which often begins with mild clinical symptoms that disappear soon after onset of infection only to flare-up again during lactation, usually resulting in mild clinical mastitis. Recently published data suggests that adhesion to and internalization into bovine mam - mary epithelial cells (BMEC) and subsequent intracellular survival might be important virulence attributes of strains of E. coli associated with chronic mastitis. The aim of this study was to compare gene expression profiles of BMEC co-cultured with acute and chronic strains of E. coli, and to delineate expression profiles of virulence genes in these strains before and after co-culture with BMEC to identify virulence factors of E. coli involved in internalization into and intracellular persistence in BMEC. Gene expression patterns in BMEC infected with acute or chronic strains were significantly different from those of uninfected cells. Expression of genes in acute strain-infected BMEC was higher than that of chronic strain-infected BMEC. Genes that showed increased expression of transcript were pri - marily proinflammatory cytokines and complement. The chronic strain of E. coli had lower cell activation than the acute strain of E. coli , potentially explaining mild clinical Bacterial Virulence & Transmission21symptoms observed in natural chronic E. coli intramam - mary infection and increased intracellular persistence of chronic E. coli strains in vitro. 19. Robo 4 Activation Intercepts Herpes Simplex Virus Suryawanshi), Department of Pathobiology (Reddy, Rajasagi, Rouse) Roundabout proteins have a well characterized function in neuronal migration in nervous system. However, activation of the endothelial-specific Robo 4 receptor by Slit 2 inhibits migration of endothelial cells, tube formation and permeability in vitro and vessel leakage in vivo induced by proangiogenic factors, especially VEGF-A. Herpes simplex (HSV-1) ocular infection results an in vision-impairing lesion stromal keratitis where VEGF-A plays an important role in mediating angiogenesis. In this study, we found evidence of the presence of a Slit 2-Robo 4 antiangiogenic network during SK. Endothelial cells expressing Robo 4 receptor were detectable as early as day 1 post HSV-1 infection with heavy invasion noted during the clinical phase of SK. We also detected a sharp rise in mRNA transcripts of Robo 4 during the clinical phase, but the ligand, Slit 2 was minimal during this stage. In line with this, provision of recombinant Slit 2 protein during the clinical phase of SK activated Robo 4 receptor and blocked activation of Arf 6 and Rac 1 (both downstream targets of VEGF-A and integrins) as was demonstrated by GTP ase activation assays. Finally, subconjunctival administration of Slit 2 protein (starting from day 1/day 6 post HSV-1 infection) in mice reduced angiogenesis and HSK lesion scores. In conclusion, we provide evidence for the existence of an anti-angiogenic Slit 2-Robo 4 network during SK; manipulation of this axis could provide therapeutic potential to treat Herpes stromal keratitis (HSK), an important cause of human sVR-1 and of Pathobiology The normal cornea is transparent, which is essential for normal vision, and although the angiogenic factor VEGF-A is present in the cornea, its angiogenic activity is imped-ed by being bound to a soluble form of the VEGF recep-tor-1 (sVR-1). This study investigates the mechanisms by which herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the eye results in neovascularization, an essential step in the pathogenesis of the vision-impairing lesion, stromal kera - titis (SK). We demonstrate that HSV-1 infection results in an imbalance in the production of VEGF-A and sVR-1. Levels of VEGF-A were increased, but the production of sVR-1 was decreased. Moreover, the sVR-1 protein made was degraded by the metalloproteinase (MMP) enzyme MMP-7 and MMP-9 produced by infiltrating neutrophils. The outcome was that the VEGF-A produced was able to induce neovascularization. Inhibition of sVR-1 break - down with the MMP (MMPi), marimostat, or the provision of exogenous recombinant sVR-1 protein, resulted in reduced angiogenesis. Our results demonstrate that HSV infection causes ocular neovascularization by changing the balance between VEGF-A production and its soluble inhibitory receptor. Future therapies aimed to in - crease the production and activity of sVR-1 protein could benefit the management of SK. 21. Regulatory T Cell Expression of Herpes Virus Entry Mediator (HVEM) Following HSV-1 Infection Sundararajan, Sachin Mulik, Medicine Program (Sharma, Mulik), Department of Microbiology (Sundararajan), Depart - ment of Pathobiology (Rouse) In many infections, especially those that are chronic, the outcome may be influenced by the activity of one or more types of regulatory T cells (Tregs), particularly those that express FOXP3. In many instances, for example the response that follows HSV infection, the majority of Viral Pathology & Immunity22expanded Tregs are not antigen specific. In this report, we demonstrate one possible mechanism by which HSV-1 infection could act to signal and expand the Treg popu-lation. We show that HVEM, a tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member that interacts with the gD protein of HSV-1 to facilitate cell entrance, is expressed by FOXP3+ T cells and that engagement of HVEM by its ligand expands the Treg population. To demonstrate this, FOXP3-GFP knock in mice were infected with HSV kos, and change in cell numbers of Tregs and their expres - sion levels of HVEM were recorded in draining popliteal lymph node (DLN). Treg expansion occurred following HSV-1 infection, peaking at around day 8 compared to the peak numbers of CD8+T cells (day 5 p.i). Both FOXP3+ and FOXP3- CD4 T cells expressed HVEM in the resting state, but Tregs upregulated HVEM reaching highest MFI at day 7 p.i. In vitro stimulation of DLN cells with UV-inactivated HSV kos further up regulated HVEM on Tregs (possibly through gD) and down regulated on FOXP3 _ cells suggesting a possibility that engaging this recep - tor with gD expressed by infected cells results in Treg activation and expansion, which in turn modulates CD8+ effector responses. 22. Deficient Virus-specific IgA Production Following Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 Infection of the Respiratory Tract Aarthi Sundararajan, Hye Mee Joo, Mark Y . Sangster Department of Microbiology The B cell response to viruses that replicate in the respiratory tract typically includes a substantial IgA component that localizes in the respiratory tract. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) is a naturally occurring virus of small rodents and many features of MHV-68 infection in mice closely parallel Epstein-Barr virus infection in humans. Following intranasal (i.n.) infection, infectious MHV-68 is cleared from the lung within 2 weeks, but the virus also spreads systemically and establishes lifelong latency in B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. The respiratory mucosa is thus a critical component of MHV-68 pathogenesis, but little is known about B cell-mediated mucosal immunity to the virus. Our analysis revealed a strong MHV-68-specific IgG response in draining lymph nodes, but few IgA ASCs were detected. IgA was prominent in the response to i.n. immunization with UV-inactivated MHV-68, indicating that the IgA response was modulated by factors associated with virus replication. This effect was most evident in na\u00efve mice, since mice primed i.n. with inactivated MHV-68 and then challenged with live virus generated a strong secondary IgG and IgA response. An IgA response in IFNgR -/- mice following i.n. MHV-68 infection indicated a role for IFNg in opposing IgA production, perhaps by establishing a strongly polarizing Th1-type environment. Down-regulation of IgA production by MHV-68 may reflect a high level of viral adaptation to the respiratory tract that favors viral survival and transmission. 23. In Vitro Time Dependence of Water-Soluble Chitosan Against Foodborne Viral Svetlana Zivanovic, Doris H. D'Souza Department of Food Science and Technology Chitosan is a non-toxic, natural, biodegradable polymer with antimicrobial activity, recently approved by the EPA. Chitosan's effects on foodborne viruses have not been investigated in detail. We evaluated the time dependence of water-soluble chitosan against foodborne viral vitro. Water-soluble chitosan (53kDa) was mixed with equal volume of virus at ~7log 10PFU/ml to provide final concentrations of 0.7% and 0.35% chitosan, and samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C and room tempera - ture (RT) for 2 hours, 1 hour, and 30, 15, and 5 minutes. Duplicate treated and untreated viruses were enumerated using standardized plaque assays. At both temperatures, increasing contact time enhanced reduction of FCV , but there was no significant effect on at log 10PFU/ ml after 2 hours at 37\u00b0C and RT, respectively. Chitosan at 0.35% decreased FCV by ~0.6 and ~0.1 log 10PFU/ml after 2 hours at 37\u00b0C and RT, respectively. Chitosan at 0.7% for 1 hour, and 30, 15 and 5 minutes showed FCV reductions of 1.6, ~0.8, ~0.2, and ~0.2 log 10PFU/ml, respectively, at 37\u00b0C, with 0.8 log10PFU/ml reduction at RT after 1 hour and insignificant reduction at 30 minutes. Chitosan at 0.35% for 1 hour showed reductions of <0.2 and ~0.1 log 10PFU/ml at 37\u00b0C and RT. The results indicate that 0.7% chitosan at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours is needed for significant activity. Chitosan shows potential as a natural antiviral to control foodborne viral infections. Viral Pathology & Immunity2324. Antiviral Effects of Chitosan as Affected by its Molecular Weight and Degree of Acetylation Robert Davis, Doris H. D'Souza, Svetlana Zivanovic Department of Food Science and Technology Chitosan is a cationic polysaccharide that has been ap - proved as a biopesticide due to demonstrated improve - ment of plant resistance to fungal and viral attack. Although foodborne viruses are the leading cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis, information on chitosan efficacy against human enteric viruses is limited. The ob-jectives of this work were to determine the effectiveness of chitosan on 3 enteric viral surrogates and to further investigate the effect of molecular weight and degree of acetylation (DA) of chitosan on its phiX174. Purified chitosans were dissolved in water (53kDa) or 1% acetic acid (other chitosans), filtered through 0.2m membrane, and mixed with equal volume of 5 log PFU/ml virus in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The final concentration of chitosan was 0.7%, and virus-chitosan suspensions were incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C. Untreated viruses in PBS or PBS with 0.5% acetic acid were tested as controls. FCV , MS2 and 0.65 log PFU/ml, while 421kDa chitosan reduced 2.22, 3.69 and 1.01 log PFU/ml, respectively, compared to the PBS control, with intermediate reductions for the other two chitosans. To date, this is the first report on chito - san's effects against phiX174. Overall, chitosan showed a greater log reduction on FCV and MS2 than phiX174, with 421kDa causing the greatest effect on both viruses. Methods based on chitosan application show promise for inactivating foodborne viruses. 25. Combination of Lecithin and High Pressure Homogenization for the Inactivation of Human Norovirus Surrogates in Milk and Orange Juice Katie Horm , Doris D'Souza, Federico Harte Department of Food Science and Technology Novel processing technologies that inactivate viruses in foods and retain nutritional attributes remain in high demand. High pressure homogenization (HPH) is one novel technology that needs research for viral inactivation in fluids. In the absence of culturable human noroviruses, cultivable murine were used for infectivity. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of HPH alone or with an emulsifier (lecithin) on MNV and FCV inactivation in skim milk and orange juice (OJ). Experiments were conducted in duplicate using pressures of 0, 100, 200, 250, and 300 MPa for <2 seconds and plaque assayed in duplicate. For FCV in milk, reductions of 4 log10 PFU/ml at 300 MPa and ~1.3 log at 250 MPa with no reduction at 200 were obtained. For OJ, FCV was reduced by 4 and ~1 log at 300 and 250 MPa only. MNV in milk showed reductions of ~1.3 and ~0.1 log at 300 and 250 MPa, respectively, and none below 200 MPa. MNV in OJ was reduced by~0.8 and ~0.4 log at 300 and 250 MPa, respectively. Lecithin had minimal effects, where MNV in milk or OJ containing lecithin showed 1.32 or 2.5 log reduction, respectively, at 300 MPa. FCV showed complete inactivation in OJ or milk combined with lecithin at 300 MPa. At 250 MPa, FCV in milk or OJ with lecithin showed reductions of 1.77 and 0.78 log, respectively. These results show that HPH has potential for commercial use to inactivate foodborne viruses. 26. Size of Food Bowl and Scoop Affects Amount of Food Owners Feed their Dogs Maryanne Murphy, Claudia A. Kirk, Joseph W. Bartges, Angela L. Lusby Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences Canine obesity is increasing at a dramatic rate, and under - standing factors impacting the amount of food pet own - ers provide their dogs may improve weight management. Human research has shown the size of food bowls, plates and utensils can significantly impact the amount of food portioned and consumed. This effect can be attributed to the Delboeuf optical illusion in which a circle enclosed by a larger ring appears bigger than the circle alone. To in-vestigate the existence of a similar effect with dog owners, 46 dogs and their owners were recruited for a 4-treatment, randomized prospective trial. Owners scooped out a nor - mal kibble-based meal using a small bowl (4.75 cups) and small scoop (1.5 cups), small bowl and large scoop (3.6 cups), large bowl (10 cups) and small scoop, or a large bowl and large scoop. Each treatment was used once per owner over 4 visits. Repeated measures ANOV A revealed the mean amount of food portioned using the small bowl Nutrition & Metabolism24and small scoop was significantly less than the large bowl- large scoop combination (150.7 g vs 184.5 g, respectively, p<0.05). The small bowl and large scoop combination did not differ from large bowl and small scoop (171.5 g vs 172.7 g, respectively, p>0.05). Owners were more likely to portion a larger amount of food with a large bowl and large scoop. Results are consistent with human data and emphasize the need for owners to use standard measur - ing cups. Results also suggest owner compliance dur - ing weight loss programs may be improved with smaller bowls and serving scoops. 27. Nutritional Ergogenic Aids: The Effects of Carbohydrate-protein Supplementation During Endurance Exercise Adriana Coletta, Hollie Raynor Department of Nutrition This study examined performance benefits from ingesting a carbohydrate (CHO), carbohydrate-protein (CHO-P), and double carbohydrate (CHO-CHO) compared to a placebo (PLA) supplement, during a time trial (TT) run. Twelve male recreational runners (age = 32.4\u00b19.5yrs; BMI completed 4, 12-mile TT runs at 75% of their race pace. Dietary consis - tency within the 24-hour time period prior to each run was controlled. Throughout each run, participants consumed 625mLs of 1 of the 4 supplements aforementioned. A Latin square design counterbalanced supplement order. Endurance performance was measured by time to com - plete the 12-mile run and time to complete the last 1.2 miles of the run, where participants were instructed to run at maximal effort, 100% race pace. A main effect of time occurred during the TTs for heart rate (HR) and perceived exertion (RPE). HR significantly increased from the start to the start of the maximal effort and was higher at completion of the effort (84.4\u00b114.5bpm, 166.0\u00b18.3bpm, 178.8\u00b17.4bpm, p<0.001); RPE (Borge 10-point scale) significantly to completion of TT (4.7\u00b10.7, 9.7\u00b10.9, p< 0.001). No significant difference was found in overall time to complete the 12-mile run (PLA = 88.6\u00b111.6min; CHO = 89.1\u00b111.3min; CHO-P = 89.1\u00b111.8min; and CHO-CHO = 89.6\u00b111.9min) or maxi mal effort (PLA = 8.3\u00b11.2min; CHO = 8.2\u00b11.2min; CHO-P = 8.2\u00b11.2min; and CHO-CHO = 8.4\u00b11.5 min) between supplements. These findings suggest that type of supple - mentation (CHO, CHO-CHO, CHO-P) has no effect on enhancing endurance performance in male recreational runners during TT runs. 28. Effects of Leucine and Calcitriol on Monocyte-Vascular Endothelial Cell Adhesion Benjamin Curry, Michael Zemel, John Biggerstaff Department of Nutrition We previously demonstrated that calcitriol and leucine modulate adipocyte and macrophage cytokine production. Since several of the affected cytokines may modulate vascular infiltration by monocytes, we tested the hypothesis that calcium (via calcitriol suppression) and leucine attenuate vascular infiltration. Adipocytes were treated with vehicle, calcitriol (to mimic calcium deprivation), leucine or both for 48 hours and conditioned medium (CM) collected and incubated with fluorescently-labeled adherence was then quantified by microscopy and image analysis. Results are presented as a monocyte : endothelial cell ratio (M:E). Calcitriol (228% increase, p = 0.0001). Conversely, leucine (0.5 mM) markedly decreased the M:E to 0.013+0.011 (p value = 0.001); moreover, addition of leucine CM to the calcitriol CM treatment abolished the effects of calcitriol. A parallel experiment using flow cytometry of CD11b expression on U937 cells under parallel conditions showed an identical trend to the microscopy data. These data show that monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is decreased in the presence of leucine and increased by calcitriol, suggesting that foods rich in calcium and leucine may be beneficial in reducing monocyte adhesion.

Assessing Potential for DNA Methylation Patterns to Affect Adipocyte Metabolic Gene Expression Julia Stair Gouffon, Michael Zemel Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program (Gouffon, Zemel), Department of Nutrition (Zemel), Affymetrix Core Lab (Gouffon) Recent experiments have shown the importance of epigenetics as a means of intermediate gene expres -Nutrition & Metabolism25sion control, serving as a kind of rheostat allowing for modulation or complete restriction of gene expression. Epigenetic modifications include changes in histones, methylation of cytosine residues in CpG islands and control by small RNAs. Changes in the epigenetic status of a cell can effect differentiation and determine the fate of stem cells and fibroblasts. Maternal nutritional status, as well as current nutritional inputs, are critical for sup - plying methyl groups in pyrimidine synthesis and have been demonstrated to alter the phenotype of offspring. Therefore, we predict that specific nutrient availability will affect adipocyte development and thereby influence subsequent chronic disease risk. Accordingly, our present work seeks to determine if the methylation level of CpG islands can be influenced in adipocytes and if so, how this might affect gene signaling in mature adipocytes and a mouse model system. Methylated regions of adipocyte genomic DNA was obtained using a methylation-specific antibody and hybridized against a whole genome CpG island array (Nimblegen). We found methylated regions in or near transcription start sites for acetyl CoA carbox-ylase A, acetyl CoA carboxylase oxidase, DNA methyltransferase 1 and 2, hormone sensitive lipase, resistin, retinoid X receptor beta and vitamin D receptor. Work is ongoing to determine if these regions can be influenced by addition of folate or a methyltransferase inhibitor using sequencing after bisulfate conversion and amplification of regions of interest. 30. Dairy Attenuation of Oxidative and Inflammatory Stress in Metabolic Syndrome Ren\u00e9e A. Stancliffe, Michael B. Zemel Department of Nutrition We previously demonstrated that dairy components (calcium, leucine, & dairy peptides) suppress adipocyte and macrophage-mediated oxidative and inflammatory stress. Since oxidative and inflammatory burdens are magnified in metabolic syndrome, we have assessed the effects of low (<0.5 servings) vs. adequate (3.5servings) dairy (LD vs. AD) diets on oxidative and inflammatory stress in the absence of caloric restriction in 40 metabolic syndrome subjects with habitually low dairy intakes. Diet had no effect on body weight over the 12-week study, but AD significantly reduced waist circumference and DXA-measured trunk fat (p<0.01 for both), while LD had no effect. AD attenuated oxidative stress, with a 35% decrease in MDA evident at 7 days (p<0.01), while LD had no effect. Similarly, inflammatory markers were suppressed by AD, with decreases in TNF- evident at 7 days and further reductions through 12 weeks (35%, p<0.05), IL-6 (21%, p<0.02), MCP-1 (14% drop at 12 weeks, p<0.05), and a corresponding 55% increase in adiponectin (55% at 12 weeks, p,0.01). LD exerted no effect on these markers. Thus, increasing dairy intake results in attenuation of oxidative and inflammatory stress in metabolic syndrome. Supported by the National Dairy Council. 31. Microarray Profiling of Chicken Adipose Tissue under Insulin Neutralization and Fasting Conditions Bo Ji, Arnold M. Saxton, Jean Simon, Suchita Das, Shawn R. Campagna, Jessica R. Gooding, Brynn H. V oy Department of Animal Science (Ji, Saxton, Das, V oy), Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Simon), Department of Chemistry (Campagna, Gooding) Excessive fat accumulation in today's commercial broiler chickens due to intensive genetic selection for rapid growth is a problem for both the broiler industry and consumers. Developing approaches to reduce fat deposition requires improved understanding of avian adipose tissue development and physiology. We used microarray profiling to characterize the molecular response to energy manipulation in chicken adipose tissue and to test its sensitivity to insulin, a key hormone in energy use. Approximately 3 week-old commercial broiler chickens (ISA915) were fed ad libitum, fasted for 5 hours, or fed but deprived of insulin by injections of anti-insulin serum. Plasma was used to measure circulating levels of insulin, glucose, tri-iodothyronine (T3), expression data using the Affymetrix GeneChip Chicken Genome Array identified a total of 1016 genes that were differentially expressed within different contrasts after correction for multiple testing, with the vast majority of differences due to fasting. Gene ontology analysis indicated that genes responsive to fasting were enriched for many functions related to cellular metabolism. Gene-phenotype correlation with plasma hormone levels suggests significant relationships between gene expression in adipose tissue and plasma T3 and NEFA levels. Ongoing measures of global metabolite profiles using mass spectrometry will be integrated with transcriptomics Nutrition & Metabolism26and physiological data. These data support that concept that insulin action in chicken adipose differs significantly from that in mammals and provide a foundation for further study into molecular bases for adipose expansion in poultry. 32. Mechanisms Linking Overproduction of Angiotensinogen by Adipose Tissue to Inflammation, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Nishan S Kalupahana , Sarah J Fletcher, Taryn Stewart, V oy, Annie Quignard-Boulange, David Wasserman, Naima Moustaid-Moussa Obesity Research Center and Department of Animal Science (Kalupahana, Fletcher, Stewart, V oy, Moustaid-Moussa), UMR914 INRA-AgroParisTech, Paris, France (Quignard-Boulange), Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University (Wasserman) Activation of the adipose tissue renin angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in obesity and co-morbidity. We hypothesized that adipose overproduction of angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensinogen (Agt) will exacerbate obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance. To test this hypothesis, we bred mice overexpressing Agt in the adipose tissue via the adipose-specific promoter aP2 (aP2-Agt mice). Plasma Agt levels in the aP2-Agt mice were 25% higher than the wild type, in agreement with earlier reports supporting the endocrine role for adipose-derived Agt. These mice were glucose intolerant and exhibited a near doubling of visceral adiposity, concomitant with adipocyte hypertrophy when compared to their wild-type littermates. When subjected to a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, aP2-Agt mice exhibited lower insulin-stimulated glucose clearance when compared to B6 mice. This difference was largely accounted for by reduced muscle glucose uptake, in sharp contrast with sustained insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by fat. Proteomic studies of adipose tissue showed that P2-Agt mice exhibited significantly lower expression of key antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) and higher expression of lipogenic proteins (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) when compared to the wild-type. In conclusion, overproduction of Agt from adipose tissue results in increased visceral adiposity, adipocyte hypertrophy, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, at least in part due to reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake. Further, our data indicate that increased oxidative stress in adipose tissue and pro-inflammatory adipo/cytokine levels are potential mechanisms for insulin resistance in this model.

Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) Regulates Hypertensive, Inflammatory and Adipogenic Mediators in Mouse and Moustaid-Moussa Department of (Agt) and has been linked to obesity and associated metabolic disorders with a common feature being inflammation. While n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are known to modulate adiposity and inflammatory status, PUFA-mediated regulation of the adipose renin-angiotensin system and the specific mechanisms by which PUFAs modulate the endocrine functions of adipose tissue remain unclear. Thus, we investigated the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, n3-PUFA) and arachidonic acid (AA, n6-PUFA) on expression and secretion of Agt and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression of adipogenic and lipogenic markers in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatments lasted up to 48 hours, and culture media as well as cell extracts (RNA and proteins) were prepared. Agt expression and secretion was detected only in differentiated mature adipocytes. Further, non-differentiated pre-adipocytes were not responsive to PUFA. Both acids increased intracellular Agt protein adipocytes, and AA dose-dependently increased Agt secretion into culture media while EPA dose-dependently decreased Agt. In agreement with its pro-inflammatory effects, EPA (not AA) significantly reduced Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) secretion. human adipocytes from both lean and obese subjects significantly reduced secretion of MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-8. EPA dose dependently measured in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stably transfected with NF-kB responsive reporter (NF-kB-Luc) while AA treatment reported the opposite. These studies demonstrate that EPA down-regulates the secretion of inflammatory and hypertensive mediators Nutrition & Metabolism27from adipocytes, and those activities were at least partially mediated via repression of NF-kB activation. 34. Synthesis and Characterization of Diamond-like Carbon Films for Biomedical Applications Russell Lee Leonard, Saad A. Hasan, Alexander Terekhov, Robert A. Erck, James H. Dickerson, Jacqueline A. Johnson Department of Materials Science and Engineering (Leonard, Terekhov, Johnson), Vanderbilt University Department of Ma - terials Science and Engineering (Hasan, Dickerson), Argonne National Laboratory (Erck) The objective of this research is to produce diamond-like carbon (DLC) films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) to be used as coatings for biomedical materials. To this end, films have been deposited on a variety of substrates including silicon, fused silica, and silicon nitride. The films have been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, ball-on-flat tribometer, and contact angle machine. Film adhesion has been checked by soaking the films in simulated body fluid (SBF) and monitoring the quality of the film surface at varying time intervals using an optical microscope. DLC coatings have been produced with an average surface roughness of less than 1 nm and a lubricated friction coefficient of 0.7. Contact angles for the films vary between 79 and 88 degrees. The DLC coatings on fused silica show no delamination after 9 weeks of immersion in SBF. Research is ongoing. Current results will be presented. 35. In vitro Evaluation of Artificial Membrane Biocompatibility Michael Beeler , Steve Minkin, Patricia Brown, Benjamin Curry, Linda Cahalan, Patrick Cahalan, John Biggerstaff Center for Environmental Biotechnology (Beeler, Minkin, Brown, Department Cahalan) Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a technique for providing life support to patients whose lungs are unable to provide sufficient oxygenation to the blood. In the early days, major complication with this technique was excessive bleeding due to complete anticoagulation (heparinization). Today, heparin-coating of ECMO equipment surfaces has improved the performance of the technique, allowing ECMO patients to receive minimal or no systemic heparinization. However, treated surfaces are still not fully blood-compatible, and clot formation and immune activation within the ECMO circuit eventually reduce the performance of the membrane oxygenator and can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation and embolisms. To address this problem, methods are being developed to improve the quality of heparin surface-coatings for use in ECMO equipment. In this study, we report the use of a new and improved methodology for in vitro evaluation of surface biocompatibility, using temperature-controlled perfusion system with human blood. We evaluated 2 heparin-coatings (0.15M and 0.5M EDA/MES + heparin) on the biocompatibility of gas-exchange membranes. We report a substantial improvement in the biocompatibility of the heparin-coated membranes compared to control membranes, including reductions in thrombin generation (90+/- 1.2%) and complement activation (51+/- 1.4%) in circulating blood and reduced deposition of 0.3%) on the membrane surface (p<0.05). This new dynamic in vitro biocompatibility testing system is an improvement on static systems because of its ability to more accurately simulate the fluid dynamics of the circulatory system. 36. Optimizing the Performance of ZBLAN Glasses as Image Plates Manh Vu , Jackie Johnson, Stefan Schweizer Department of Materials Science, UT Space Institute (Vu, Johnson), Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics, aluminum, are being developed as scintillators and storage phosphors mainly for applications in medicine. The materials are doped with europium and chlorine. Upon heat treatment, barium chloride nanoparticles containing optically active europium (II) form within the glass matrix. X-ray diffraction (XRD) has shown a particular phase of the barium chloride nanoparticles to be allied with either storage or scintillation. The hexagonal phase is synonymous with scintillation, and the orthorhombic phase is synonymous with the storage mechanism. In single crystals, it has long been thought that oxygen defects gave rise to the storage of electron-hole pairs, so these were artificially introduced into the glass Innovative Biomedical Technologies28ceramic described here in the hope of enhancing storage. However, by serendipity, it was discovered that in fact the reducing conditions gave rise to storage, the complete opposite to what happens in single crystals. Extensive characterization of the materials for x-ray imaging applications had taken place to determine the exact composition and structure/property relationships by ion chromatography, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectroscopy as well as x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and many large facility techniques. In situ transmission electron microscopy is ongoing to explore the interface kinetics between the nanoparticles and glass matrix. A summary of medical applications and scientific development method will be presented on ZBLAN glass ceramics for imaging applications. 37. Fibroblast and Bacterial Growth on Infection-resistant Materials Steven Minkin, Michael Beeler, Patrick Cahalan, Linda Inc. Cahalan) Sites of transdermal medical implants (e.g., for indwelling catheters, ports) are at increased risk of infection. Materials destined for long-term transdermal implantation should encourage local wound healing but not serve as a site for bacterial biofilm formation. Thus, infection-resistant materials should inhibit bacterial adhesion, or be actively bactericidal, while promoting fibroblast adhesion. In this work, we evaluate fibroblast and bacterial growth on 29 synthetic materials: four material types (polyurethane, silicone, polyester, and titanium) with various combinations of surface modifications (hydrogel, collagen, gentamicin [GS], and heparin). Fluorescence microscopy human (HFF-1), Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to the material surfaces. Levels of GS release from GS-loaded materials were determined by measuring inhibition of E. coli growth in liquid and solid media. The results show that addition of hydrogel inhibits bacterial adhesion and addition of collagen promotes fibroblast adhesion. Gentamicin-loaded materials were actively bactericidal while allowing for robust attachment of fibroblasts.38. Enhanced Nerve Cell Attachment, Proliferation, and Differentiation on Hydrogels Grafted with Photo-polymerizable Poly-L-Lysine Lei Cai, Shanfeng Wang Department of Materials Science Engineering Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylates (PEGDAs) are injectable and photo-crosslinkable hydrogels with degradability to mimic extracellular matrices in brain and nerve tissues. Three photo-polymerizable PEGDAs with different molecular weights synthesized using K2CO3 as the proton scavenger other than the widely used triethylamine have been modified with a crosslinkable poly-L-Lysine (PLL) with 1 double bond at the end synthesized using allylamine as the initiator. PEGDAs with different molecular weights exhibited controllable mechanical properties that greatly influenced the behavior of nerve cells, such as PC12 cells and neural stem cells (NSCs). For both pristine PEGDA-based and PLL-modified hydrogels, PC12 cells were found consistently to favor softer substrates by demonstrating higher attachment, faster proliferation, and more neurite extension in the presence of nerve growth factor. Tethered PLL chains dramatically enhanced PC12 cell attachment, proliferation and neurite extension in differentiation. The same preference on mechanical stimuli was found in NSCs, while grafted PLL chains with charges significantly improved the microenvironment for NSCs to proliferate and differentiate. These results suggest that PEGDA hydrogels with grafted PLL segments with optimal mechanical properties and cell behavior have excellent potential as injectable materials for nerve regeneration. 39. Predictive Ophthalmic Simulation and Applications Ying-Ling Chen, J. W. L. Lewis, Lei Shi Department of Physics Recently, high precision ophthalmic patient data have become available to characterize surfaces of the cornea and crystalline lens, wavefront aberrations, and ocular element biometry in microscopic accuracy. These measurements can be incorporated into the creation of optically functional and analytical, personal-tailored, eye models. Computational personalized eye modeling techniques are beneficial since they allow the integrated Innovative Biomedical Technologies29information to be quantitatively evaluated without repetitive examination of human subjects. Simulating ocular device measurements using eye modeling is also useful to aid medical personnel training and for evaluating ocular instrument sensitivity. The objectives of this project are to investigate the feasibility of personalized eye modeling on normal and diseased conditions and to demonstrate the applications of realistic ophthalmic simulation. Specifically, contemporary optical design programs, ZEMAX and ASAP, are used with clinically-acquired patient data to construct the 3-dimensional optical models. These customized models have identical clinical measured details as well as optical performance and visual acuity. Using optical parameters of a common ophthalmic streak retinoscope and the eye models, the clinical observations of the diseased and normal retinal reflex patterns were simulated successfully. A comparison of the retinal reflex images between the laboratory measurements and simulations were also obtained. These results show the viability of predictive medicine and possibly a revolutionary approach in developing ophthalmic optical instruments with eye modeling technique. 40. Design of an Automatic Cover-Uncover Test for Diagnosing Strabismus and Ocular Alignment Impairments Lei Shi, Ying-Ling Chen, J.W.L. Lewis Department of Physics With a 2-5% prevalence rate in the United States, amblyopia plays the key role of childhood monocular blindness. Pediatric strabismus must be detected/ treated early to optimize the potential for binocular vision and to decrease the risk of amblyopia. However, uncooperative children (49%, n = 377) and the time-consuming current methods (23%) deter mass pediatric screening [Kemper 2006]. The objective of this study is to design a child friendly, objective, and automatic method to diagnose strabismus and ocular alignment impairments. This method utilizes a dynamic Hirschberg test to monitor the binocular orientation, gazing angle, and convergence while the examinee's eyes pursue a moving bulls-eye target on a screen in a 10-second trajectory. The novel design also uses a nasal divider to produce a binocular viewing at the center region of the screen and 2 monocular viewing zones at either side of the screen. While the examinee follows the target's trajectory through the 3 viewing zones, test results of cover-uncover and smooth pursuit are automatically obtained from both eyes. Dynamic testing allows us to obtain the Hirschberg ratio and fovea kappa angle for each eye to calibrate the result. Since the eye position is instantaneously captured and used in the analysis, eye movement does not affect the performance of test. The pilot study results of 40 optometry students show interesting insights of eye movement behavior. This rapid diagnostic method is even more sensitive when the parameters of 2 eyes are compared. 41. Injectable Blends Consisting of Poly(propylene fumerate) and Methacryl-Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane for Regulating Material Properties and Bone Cell Behavior Kan Wang, Shanfeng Wang Department of Materials Science and Engineering Polyhedral oligomeric (POSS) has POSS cages into polymers has been reported to improve the mechanical and viscoelastic properties of the matrix polymer. Because of their non-toxicity, POSS-based polymeric nanocomposites are suitable for biomedical applications. Poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) is a linear unsaturated polyester and an excellent injectable, degradable material for bone tissue engineering applications. PPF can be crosslinked though its carbon-carbon double bonds and can be degraded by simple hydrolysis of ester bonds. The degradation time depends on PPF molecular weight, type of cross-linker, and cross-linking density. In this work, we have blended PPF with 2 molecular weights and methacryl-POSS at different compositions and have studied their rheological and thermal properties, and the mechanical, thermal, and surface characteristics after crosslinking using photo-initiation. Methacryl-POSS was found to speed up the photo-crosslinking and decrease the viscosity of PPF, which were both important in the formation of PPF networks in bone surgeries. In addition, the density of crosslinkable segments and mechanical properties could be regulated by blending methacryl-POSS with different compositions. In vitro cell studies have been performed to evaluate the biocompatibility of this series of hybrid polymer networks using mouse MC3T3 cells and investigate the correlation between material properties and cell behavior.

An Acute Reversible Experimental Model of Pneumonia in Pigs: Time-related Histological and Clinical Sign Changes Nicolas Villarino , Tomas Martin-Jimenez Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program (Villarino), Department of Comparative Medicine (Martin-Jimenez) Pneumonia represents one of the most important diseases both in veterinary and human medicine. A considerable amount of information about pneumonia is generated from experimental animal models. However, there is limited information about pneumonia models involving growing commercial pigs. The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term survival rates, clinical response, and lung gross and microscopic changes in growing commercial pigs treated intra-tracheally with 2 dose levels of lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia coli (LPS- E-coli). Fourteen healthy pigs were randomly allocated to 3 groups: (i) no-LPS (n = 1), (ii) (LPS 1 mg/mL, 10 mL/pig, n = 7) and (iii) (LPS 0.5 mg/mL, 10 mL/pig, n = 6). Pigs were evaluated during a period of 0-144 hours post-LPS-E-coli administration following a terminal schedule design. Two pigs from each dose level were euthanized at 24, 48 and 144 hours post-LPS. Clinical, gross and histological changes were evaluated using a score system. None of the animals died as a consequence of the treatments. All the LPS-treated animals showed lung gross changes. A consistent acute lung inflammatory response was induced by both LPS dose levels. A consistent reversible recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils was observed. The highest cellular infiltration level was observed at 24 hours after challenge. A dose-dependent cellular infiltration was evident. The highest clinical scores were evident in both experimental dose levels within 3 and 5 hours after LPS administration. The administration of LPS-E-coli, under the conditions evaluated, can be used to induce an acute reproducible lung inflammatory model in growing commercial pigs. 43. Evaluation of Tyrosinase Expression in Canine and Equine Melanocytic Tumors Luis Lembcke, Jeff Phillips, Stephen Kania, James Blackford Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program (Lembcke), Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences (Lembcke, Phillips), Department of Comparative Medicine (Kania), Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences (Blackford) DNA vaccination against proteins specifically or preferentially expressed by tumors is a strategy for cancer therapy. To have a successful vaccine, one must identify tumor proteins that have restricted expression patterns and can facilitate an appropriate immune response while not generating immune tolerance or significant auto-immunity. To this end, a vaccine was developed for use in dogs with melanoma that targets tyrosinase, an antigen preferentially expressed in melanoma tumors (Oncept). Furthermore, pending definition of the expression pattern of this antigen, the vaccine may also be considered in other affected species such as the horse. Tyrosinase is preferentially expressed in canine and equine melanocytic tumors and is associated with tumor histology. A total of 42 canine and 8 equine melanocytic tumor samples were used in this study. RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues using standard techniques. TaqMan RT-PCR assays were designed to amplify the exon 1/2 boundary of canine and equine tyrosinase. Relative expression levels were determined and compared to both pigmented and non-pigmented cutaneous tissues. High tyrosinase expression was found in both pigmented and non-pigmented melanocytic tumors with insignificant levels in normal skin. No significant difference in tyrosinase expression was found between different canine or equine histologic variants of melanocytic tumors. Melanocytic tumors expressed significantly higher levels of tyrosinase than non-melanocytic tumors and/or control samples. This RT-PCR methodology is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of tyrosinase expression in both fresh and fixed tumor samples and demonstrates the preferential expression of this antigen in melanoma tumors. 44. Effects of Season on Adrenocorticotropin Hormone (ACTH) Concentrations in Horses with Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID) from 15 Different Locations in East Tennessee Sarah Beth Elliott, Nicholas Frank, Robin McClamroch, Kelly Ann Chameroy, Ferenc Toth, Eric Etheridge Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences We have previously reported a seasonal increase in adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) concentrations in horses from a single farm in Tennessee, with significantly higher concentrations detected in September and Octo - ber. Since all the horses included in the previous study were from the same farm, this study was undertaken to Clinical Sciences31determine whether seasonal alterations in ACTH con- centrations occur in horses from different locations. We evaluated 18 horses, 12 horses with pituitary pars inter - media dysfunction and 6 unaffected animals, located on 15 different farms in East Tennessee to test the hypothesis that seasonal alterations in ACTH concentrations occur with varying diets and husbandry methods. Eighteen horses (7 mares, 11 geldings) with a median (range) age of 19.8 (8 to 45) years were included in the study. Horses were sampled under fed (hay or grass) conditions every month across a 12-month period (August 2007 to July 2008). Blood concentrations of hormones and metabolites were measured. Data were analyzed by mixed model for repeated measures. Plasma ACTH concentrations were significantly affected by season (time effect; p< 0.001), with a significantly higher mean \u00b1 SD concentration (155.5 \u00b1 292.6 pg/mL) detected in August, compared with all other months. There was no effect of season on serum insulin concentrations. Mean ACTH concentration was higher (p = 0.0202) in horses with PPID, but disease status did not significantly alter the seasonal effect. We conclude that horses from different locations, with varying diets and husbandry practices, have significantly higher plasma ACTH concentrations in August. 45. Novel Endocrine Disruptor in Personal Care Products Jiangang (Jay) Chen, Bill L. Lasley, Antoni J. Duleba Department of Nutrition (Chen), Center for Health and the En - vironment, University of California Davis (Lasley), Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California Davis Medical Center (Duleba) Many xenobiotics have been associated with endocrine effects in a wide range of biological systems. Triclocarban (TCC; 3,4,4'-trichlorocarbanilide), an antimicrobial compound used in personal care products, was evaluated for its endocrine disrupting property. Recent evidence demonstrates that TCC is a common contaminant of the environment and has been detected in high concentrations in US water systems as well as in agricultural soils subject to land application of biosolids. In this report, cell-based sex hormone receptor-mediated bioassays were used to demonstrate that TCC has little or no endocrine activity when tested alone, but acts to enhance sex hormone-induced steroid receptor-mediated transcriptional activity in vitro. This amplification effect of TCC was also apparent in vivo when TCC was added to the diet of castrated male rats that were given exogenous testosterone treatment for 10 days. All male sex accessory organs increased significantly in size after the T+TCC treatment, compared with T or TCC treatments alone. The data presented here suggest that the bioactivity of endogenous hormones may be amplified by exposure to commercial personal care products containing sufficient levels of TCC and TCC represents a new category of endocrine-disrupting substance. 46. Effects of Metformin Hydrochloride on Glucose Dynamics During Transition to Grass Paddocks in Insulin-Resistant Horses Kelly Chameroy, Nicholas Frank, Sarah B. Elliott Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences Metformin hydrochloride is used as a treatment for insulin resistance (IR) in equids. This drug may also be useful for controlling IR when insulin-resistant horses are reintroduced to pasture. We therefore tested the hypothesis that metformin alters glucose dynamics in insulin-resistant horses undergoing reintroduction to grazing. Six adult horses with chronic IR were transferred to grass paddocks after spending >15 months confined in stalls with attached gravel turnout areas. Glucose dynamics were assessed using the combined glucose-insulin test (CGIT) before and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks after horses were transferred to grass paddocks. After horses were housed in grass paddocks for 2 weeks, they were treated with metformin (15 mg/kg q12h) for 2 weeks, taken off treatment for 2 weeks, and then treated with metformin at a high dosage (30 mg/kg q12h) for 2 weeks. Horses were also reevaluated 2 weeks later. Time effects were significant (p < 0.001) for resting plasma glucose concentrations and area under the glucose curve (AUCg) values. Insulin results are pending. Mean glucose concentrations increased from 81.2 \u00b1 3.4 to 99.4 \u00b1 6.7 mg/dL over and then decreased to 81.9 \u00b1 4.0 mg/dL by 10 weeks. No differences were detected between pre- and post-metformin mean values for resting glucose concentrations or AUCg at either dosage level. However, mean AUCg significantly decreased (18.6%) across the 10-week study period. Metformin did not affect glucose dynamics in this study, but AUCg decreased over time when insulin-resistant horses were transferred to grass paddocks. Clinical Sciences3247. Assessment of Two Experimental Models for Prolonged (48 Hours) Endotoxemia in Horses Lisa Tadros, Nicholas Frank Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is detected in the blood of horses after experimental alimentary carbohydrate overload and may contribute to the development of laminitis by inducing systemic inflammation. Models for endotoxemia have focused upon single bolus infusions of LPS in the past, but clinical endotoxemia has a greater magnitude and duration. The objective of this preliminary study was therefore to assess 2 models of prolonged (48 hours) endotoxemia. Twelve healthy adult horses were randomly assigned to receive a continuous rate infusion (CRI) of LPS (80g total over 48 h; n = 4), a saline CRI (80 mL/h for 48 h; n = 4), or 8 boluses of LPS (10g q6h for 48 h; n = 4). Physical parameters were recorded every 4 hours, and intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed at -24, 8, 24, 32, and 48 hours. A treatment \u00d7 time effect (p< 0.001) was detected for rectal temperature, with LPS groups differing significantly from the saline group. Mean rectal temperature was significantly higher than baseline from 4 to 12 hours and again at 20 hours but did not increase significantly again after this point. With the exception of 1 horse, all animals treated with LPS exhibited tachycardia. Laminitis was not detected. A significant time effect was detected for area under the glucose curve, but groups did not differ significantly. No differences were detected between the 2 models, and most horses appeared to be more tolerant of LPS after 24 hours. These models increased the duration of systemic inflammation, but did not match the severity of naturally occurring disease. 48. Tear, Cornea, and Aqueous Humor Concentrations of Ciprofloxacin and Moxifloxacin after Topical Application in Normal Horses Hans D. Westermeyer , Diane V .H. Hendrix, Daniel A. Ward, Sherry K. Cox Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences (Westermeyer, Hendrix, Ward), Department of Comparative Medicine (Cox) Our objective was to determine ocular tissue drug concentrations after topical administration of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and 0.5% moxifloxacin in 28 adult horses with normal ophthalmic examinations. Both antimicrobials (0.1 ml) were delivered to the ventral conjunctival fornix as follows: Group 1 (n = 8) hours 0, 2, 4, 6; Group 2 (n = 8) hours 0, 2, 4, 6, 10; and Group 3 (n = 8) hours 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14. Tears, cornea, and aqueous humor (AH) were collected at 8, 14, and 18 hours for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Drug concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Concentration (\u00b5g/ml) of ciprofloxacin (median [25%-75%]) for groups 1, 2, and 3 in was 53.67 (25.47-88.75), respectively; in AH, they were below quantification levels in all groups. Concentrations of moxifloxacin for groups 1, 2, and 3 in tears were 188 (44.5-669.2), 107 (41.7-296), and 178 respectively. Group 1 corneal moxifloxacin concentrations were significantly higher than groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.003). Topical fluoroquinolones reach therapeutic levels in tears and cornea even when there is an intact epithelium. 49. Regional Differences in Adipose Tissue in the Sinclair Minipig Suzanne Booker, Cheryl Kojima, Shirley Newman, Minkin, John Biggerstaff, Hank (Booker, Kojima, Kattesh, Moustaid-Moussa), Department of Pathobiology (Newman), Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program (Gouffon), Center for Environmental Biotechnology (Minken, Biggerstaff), UT Obesity Research Center (Booker, Kojima, Moustaid-Moussa) Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, and mounting evidence has implicated adipose tissue endo - crine and inflammatory function in obesity-associated different depots, visceral (SQF), exhibit differential physiological properties and metabolic profiles. In this study, we sought to elucidate and characterize depot-spe - cific differences in the Sinclair minipig, a porcine model with similar physiologic properties to humans. RNA was isolated from 8-month-old minipigs and processed using the Porcine Affymetrix Gene Chip oligonucleotide array. Only transcripts for which expression differed Clinical Sciences33between treatments by 2-fold or greater with Step-up, p value < 0.05 were noted. Using this cut off, we identi - fied 598 transcript IDs whose expression changed by >2 fold. From this subset of the transcriptome, 471 IDs were up-regulated vs. 127 down- regulated in SQF compared to VF. Interestingly, the genes that that were up-regulated in SQF vs. VF included both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes such as ESR 1, while those down-regulated includ - ed pro-inflammatory and lipogenic genes such as IL-18 and FASN, respectively. Histological analysis of adipose tissue from minipig and commercial pigs revealed that minipig but not commercial pig SQF contained significant connective tissue compared to VF. Moreover, VF but not SQF from commercial pigs expressed significant levels of calprotectin, a monocyte and immature macrophage membrane marker, as assessed by immunofluorescence, compared to VF. In conclusion, these studies support the relevance of the porcine model for human obesity and studies of adipocyte biology and inflammation. Supported by USDA AFRI, UT AgResearch, and the UT-ORC. 50. Transient Silencing of Atp10c mRNA in C2C12 Myotubes Decreases Glucose Uptake Potentially via MAPK Signaling Pathway Sarah Hurst, Madhu Dhar Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program (Hurst), Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences (Dhar) Atp10c, a putative phospholipid translocase, appears to be a strong candidate for diet-induced obesity and type II diabetes. Skeletal muscle is responsible for the majority of insulin-stimulated glucose clearance via the stimula - tion of glucose uptake into targeted body tissues. Defects in this action contribute to the development of insulin resistance and type II diabetes. Studies revealed that dur - ing myogenesis, Atp10c expression increases significantly along with increased MyoD expression (p<0.05). Using siRNA technology, we were able to achieve a greater than 90% knockdown of Atp10c in myotubes derived from a murine C2C12 skeletal muscle cell line. In vitro studies revealed that when Atp10c gene expression was knocked down, glucose uptake significantly decreased (>2 fold), results of which compliment in vivo data obtained from Atp10c /ATP10C heterozygous mice. As signal transduc-tion is crucial for glucose uptake and many pathways are involved, we sought to identify Atp10c's effect on known signal transduction pathway proteins. Our results indi - cate that Atp10c may work in either one or more of the MAPK pathways as seen in changes of protein expression. Transient siRNA transfection of myotubes significantly (p<0.05) altered the level of expression of several proteins involved in signal transduction, notably the proteins p38, p44/42 and JNK. We also observed significant (p<0.05) changes in Actin and MyoD expression, which were pos-sibly affected by changes in the MAPK proteins. As such, further characterization of this protein is ongoing. 51. Anti-inflammatory and Metabolic Mechanisms by which Omega-3 Fatty Acids Improve Insulin Resistance in High Fat Booker, Nalin Siriwardhana, Naima Moustaid-Moussa Obesity Research Center and Department Science (Kalupahana, Stewart, Hadidsaz, Feltcher, Booker, Siriwardhana, Moustaid-Moussa), Michigan State University (Claycombe) In this study, we investigated the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on prevention (P) and reversal (R) of high-fat (HF) diet-induced obesity and metabolic alterations. Male C57BL/6J fed a low-fat (LF), HF or a HF-EPA-P diet for 11 weeks. A fourth group was initially fed the HF diet for 6 weeks followed by the HF-EPA-R diet for 5 weeks. As expected, mice fed the HF diet developed obesity and glucose intolerance. In contrast, mice fed HF-EPA-P diet maintained normal glucose tolerance despite weight gain when compared to the LF group. While the HF group developed fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, both HF-EPA groups (P and R) exhibited normal glycemia and insulinemia, demonstrating EPA's ability to prevent and improve insulin resistance associated with high fat feeding. Analysis of adipokines revealed that plasma adiponectin levels were lower in the HF group, but were comparable between LF and HF-EPA groups, regardless of the high fat content of the diet. Further analysis of adipose tissue adipokine levels and proteomic studies in cultured adipocytes demonstrated that EPA reduces adipose inflammation and lipogenesis, while increasing markers of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial content. These studies demonstrate that beneficial effects of EPA in improving insulin resistance are in part mediated by EPA's lipid oxidizing and anti-inflammatory effects. Nutrition & Metabolism3452. Effects of Bisphenol A on Adipocyte Growth, Metabolism, and Endocrine Functions Brantley Wyatt, Jessica Gooding, Shawn Campagna, Brynn V oy Genome Science and Technology Program (Wyatt, V oy), Department of Animal Science (V oy), Department of Chemistry (Gooding, Campagna) While diet and sedentary lifestyle remain important fac - tors in the development of obesity, recent findings have shown the possible involvement of environmental obe - sogens, chemicals that can disrupt homeostatic energy balance and increase adiposity. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a compound ubiquitous in the environment due to its widespread use in manufacturing of plastics. BPA has been shown to be an endocrine disruptor through its ability to mimic estrogen, which is now known to play important roles in adipose tissue growth and metabolism. In fact, a number of studies have shown that mice ex - posed to BPA in utero or postnatally are fatter as adults. In humans, BPA is detectable in urine of over 90% of the population, and higher levels of BPA are associated with increased incidence of heart disease. We hypothesize that BPA exposure exerts effects on adipose tissue, promot-ing adipogenesis and inflammation, and altering energy homeostasis that promotes obesity and insulin resistance. We treated adipose tissue ex vivo with BPA and looked at the effects on metabolite profiles and expression of select genes. Metabolomics data indicate that BPA-treatment altered adipose glycolysis and promoted de novo lipogen - esis. BPA treatment also increased the expression of the pro-inflammatory adipokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6. We also found that BPA increased proliferation in rat mesenchymal stem cells, suggesting that BPA may promote adipogenesis through increasing the number of adipocyte precursors. These data support the theory that BPA may disrupt energy homeostasis in adipose, promoting adipocyte expansion and proliferation, as well as inflammation. 53. Leucine Stimulation of Fatty Acid Oxidation via an mTOR-independent Mechanism Kenny Smart, Michael Zemel, Xiaocun Sun Department of Nutrition Leucine as a nutrient has been highlighted recently for its effects on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and subsequent stimulation of protein synthesis. Because leucine affects a key energetic system involving anabolism of protein, catabolic systems are also stimulated to fuel this process, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation. This project was designed to determine the mechanisms through which leucine stimulates fatty acid oxidation on skeletal muscle cells. As first steps, we sought to determine inhibition of mTOR signaling with rapamycin or of translational protein synthesis with cyclohexamide. Rapamycin (20nM) or cycloheximide (0.7 uM, 0.1 uM, and 0.07 uM) were used in the presence or absence of leucine (0.5 mM) for 4, 24, or 48 hours in C2C12 myotubes. Valine was used as a control for non-specific effects of branched chain amino acids in all experiments. Fatty acid oxidation with 3H-Pamitic acid and subsequent protein correction was performed for each treatment. Leucine stimulated fatty acid oxidation by 50% (p = 0.03); addition of rapamycin inhibited fatty acid oxidation but did not prevent leucine stimulation of fat oxidation. Similarly, leucine stimulated fatty by Thus, leucine stimulation of fatty acid oxidation appears to be independent of stimulation of mTOR signaling and protein synthesis, and the pathway(s) activated remain to be determined. 54. Quercetin Overcomes Rosiglitazone-associated Animal Science UT Obesity Research (Siriwardhana, Kalupahana, Moustaid-Moussa) The high prevalence of obesity, the most serious escalating global health problem, leads to increased risk for metabolic, cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Currently used effective T2D treatments include rosiglitazone (RZ), a potent ligand for the adipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR). Despite effectiveness of this drug in treating T2D, its side effects are of concern and include increasing adiposity as well as consequently worsening inflammation. We hypothesized that a carefully selected multifunctional natural bioactive compound may counteract RZ's negative effects and also Nutrition & Metabolism35will reduce adiposity-associated inflammation. Quercetin is one of the most widely available dietary flavonoids (found in apples, onions, teas, red wines, citrus, garlic, parsley and many other foods). It is a multifunctional natural compound with potent anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, anti-hypertensive and anti-oxidant activities. Therefore, we have selected quercetin to test against RZ-induced adiposity. Also we further extended our investigations to understand the mechanisms by which quercetin can reduce RZ-induced adiposity. Co-treatment of quercetin of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. Further, quercitin significantly decreased RZ-induced lipid accumulation in mature differentiated adipocytes. Moreover, quercetin significantly reduced the release [FAS]) from differentiating preadipocytes. In summary, quercetin is an effective anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory compound that can be used as an effective co-treatment with RZ to overcome RZ-induced adiposity and adiposity-associated inflammation. 55. Enhancing Male Reproductive Potential by Herbal Tea Therapy Marcos Gomes , Juliana Monteiro, Heidi Dolder, Medicine (Gomes, Mendis-Handa - gama), Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiology, State University of Unicamp, Brazil (Monteiro, Dolder) Heteropterys aphrodisiaca , a native Brazilian plant popularly known as \"n\u00f3-de-cachorro,\" is commonly used as an herbal tea to treat nervous and muscular disorders. Previous studies have shown that infusion of this plant results in increasing seminal vesicle mass, as well as the Leydig cell population in adult rats, suggesting that it has the potential to increase testicular testosterone production. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to test whether H. aphrodisiaca can be used as an herbal tea ther - apy to males, in order to enhance their testicular testoster - one production using the rat model. Two groups of adult rats, i.e. controls and tea-treated, were gavaged water or tea daily, respectively, for 56 days (duration of spermato - genic cycle in rats). Blood and testis tissue were collected for hormonal analysis and light microscopic morphometry of testis, respectively. Results revealed that the individual Leydig cell volume (or size), the circulating testosterone levels and spermatogenic yield in tea-treated rats were significantly higher compared to those in controls. These findings indicate that H. aphrodisiaca, when given as a daily herbal tea therapy, results in increasing the Leydig cell volume and their testosterone producing potential together with improving the spermatogenesis yield. 56. Anticancer Activity of Damnacanthal grows extensively throughout the South Pacific and was at one time the most widely used medicinal plant in the region. In addition, this evergreen shrub grows especially well in the rich volcanic ash of Hawaii. Damnacanthal, an anthraquinone compound isolated from the root of Morinda citrifolia L. shows beneficial effects on several diseases. Although it has been shown to inhibit Ras oncogene functions in cancer, the molecular mechanism by which this compound affects tumorigenesis has not been elucidated. In the present study, we characterized comprehensive anti-cancer activity of damnacanthal on human colorectal carcinoma cells. Damnacanthal significantly inhibited the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner as assessed by cell proliferation assay. Damnacanthal also showed inhibitory activity on cell migration and colony formation in HCT-116 cells. Finally, we investigated the expression of several proteins that are involved in tumorigenesis and apoptosis. Our data reveal that damnacanthal induces nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-activated gene one (NAG-1) expression and reduces cyclin D1 expression in human colorectal cancer cells, whereas p53, p21 and ATF3 expression do not change. Overall, our data indicate that damnacanthal shows a unique feature of protein expression compared to other phytochemicals, and provide a rationale for the use of damnacanthal in the treatment of colorectal cancer prevention.

Whitlock, Bahn, Pathobiology Resveratrol, a dietary phytoalexin readily available in the diet, is reported to possess anti-tumorigenic properties in several cancers, including colorectal. However, the underlying mechanism(s) involved is not completely understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of resveratrol treatment on gene modulation in HCT-116 human colorectal cancer cells and identified activating transcription factor (ATF) 3 as the most highly induced gene after treatment. We confirm resveratrol up-regulates ATF3 expression, both at the mRNA and protein level, and showed resveratrol involvement in ATF3 transcriptional regulation. Analysis of the ATF3 promoter revealed the importance of early growth response-1 (Egr-1; located at -245 to -237) and (KLF4; located putative binding sites in resveratrol-mediated ATF3 transactivation. Specificity of these sites to the Egr-1 and KLF4 protein was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. KLF4 expression; this result further suggests Egr-1 and KLF4 involvement in resveratrol-mediated activity. Furthermore, we found that Egr-1 and KLF4 act synergistically in ATF3 transactivation and provide evidence for their interaction, both of which are increased after resveratrol treatment. Egr-1 and KLF4 interaction may facilitate ATF3 transcriptional regulation by resveratrol. Taken together, these results provide a novel mechanism by which resveratrol induces ATF3 expression and represent an additional explanation of how resveratrol exerts its anti-tumorigenic effects in human colorectal cancer cells.58. Targets for Dietary Grape Seed Extract-Induced Suppression of Breast Chronic Carcinogenesis Kusum Rathore, Xiaoyu Song, Nalin Siriwardhana, Hwa-Chain Robert Comparative Medicine (Rathore, Song, Siri - wardhana, Wang), Genomic Science and Technology Program (Rathore, Wang) Breast cell carcinogenesis is a multiyear, multistep, and multipath disease process. Epidemiologic and experimen - tal evidence suggests that dietary constituents in fruits and vegetables prevent human cancers; dietary preven - tion is a cost-efficient strategy to reduce the risk of this disease. To identify dietary components for prevention of chronic human breast cell carcinogenesis, we studied biological, biochemical, and molecular target endpoints that were induced by low doses of carcinogens and sup - pressed by dietary grape seed proanthocyanidin extract. Immortalized, non-cancerous human breast epithelial MCF10A cells were repeatedly exposed to carcinogens 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and/or benzo[a]pyrene, each at picomolar concentrations, to induce cancer-associated properties in cells. We then used these changes as target endpoints to reveal the activity of GSPE in suppression of NNK- and B[a]P-induced cellu-lar carcinogenesis. We identified that cells acquiring the biological properties of reduced dependence on growth factors, anchorage-independent growth, and acinar-con-formational disruption were reduced by treatment with dietary catechins. We identified that hydroxysteroid (11-beta) dehydrogenase 2 (HSD11B2) played a novel role in NNK- and B[a]P-induced cellular carcinogenesis, and its expression acted as a molecular target endpoint in GSPE-induced suppression of cellular carcinogenesis. The ability of GSPE to reduce gene expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A1 CYP1B1, which can bioac - tivate NNK and B[a]P, may be involved in the preventive mechanism for GSPE in suppression of cellular carcino - genesis.

Medicinal Herbs Inhibit Prostate Cancer (PCa) Through p 21 via Epigenetic Regulation E-Chu Huang , Guoxun Chen, Seung Baek, Jay (Huang, Chen, Whelan), Department of Pathobiology (Baek, McEntee) In the last few years, prostate cancer (PCa) became the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Advanced PCa is the last stage of PCa where cancer cells metastasize to other organs, mostly to bone. The typical therapy for advanced PCa is hormone ablation therapy (HAT); however, following regression, the tumor eventually re-grows and is invariably fatal. Therefore, novel forms of adjuvant therapy to enhance the effectiveness of HAT need to be investigated. Some experimental studies showed that medicinal herbs inhibit prostate cancer growth, but the benefits in clinical trials are unclear. In recent studies, a combination of 10 me - dicinal herbs, Zyflamend, has been shown to reduce the aggressiveness of early stages of PCa in patients. This clinical evidence provides sufficient rational for the use of Zyflamend in advanced PCa. Using experimental models of advanced PCa, we observed that Zyflamend reduced tumor cell growth by increasing cell cycle inhibitors via epigenetic regulation. p21, a protein that inhibits cell cycle, was up-regulated in the presence of Zyflamend. Increase in p21 was associated with decreases of histone deacetylases, key mediators of cancer promotion and progression by regulating Erk1/2 signaling. Other media - tors of advanced PCa, IGF1R, AKT and androgen recep-tor, also were down-regulated by Zyflamend. In addition, these effects were not observed with the individual herbs. In summary, advanced prostate cancer is very aggressive due to the complicated survival mechanisms, and Zyfla - mend, consisting of polyherbal components, appears to be effective by coordinately modulating multiple signaling pathways that negatively affect tumor growth. 60. Capsaicin Inhibits -catenin Pathway in Colorectal Cancer Raphael L. Richardson, Seong-Ho Lee Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program (Richardson), Department of Pathobiology (Lee) Capsaicin, a compound in the chili peppers, is used as a pain reliever by blocking or interfering with neurotrans -mitter substances; however, recent data suggest that capsaicin also modulates tumor cell growth. We have previously reported that capsaicin induces apoptosis and cell growth arrest in colorectal cancer cells. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which capsaicin induces anti-tumorigenesis, we examined the -catenin pathway. Capsaicin decreased the amount of -catenin and Cyclin D-1 expression most dramatically at a dose of 100 M. When the GFP--catenin construct was transfected into SW480 cells, capsaicin reduced the expression of both en - dogenous and exogeneous -catenin, in both the nucleus and cytosol. When the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was used, -catenin degradation by capsaicin was not ob - served, indicating that capsaicin affects a protein degrada - tion pathway, thereby reducing -catenin expression. This result was confirmed by experiments with puromycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Finally, TOPflash construct containing 4 copies of -catenin response elements trans - fected and luciferase activity was measured. Capsaicin decreases TOPflash activity, suggesting that capsaicin decreases not only protein but also activity of -catenin, overall. Our results imply that capsaicin may be a chemo - preventive compound to prevent colorectal cancer through the inhibition of the -catenin pathway. 61. Sulindac Sulfide Suppresses Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule Expression Cancer Cells Jason Baek Department of Pathobiology Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are extensively used over the counter to treat headaches and inflammation as well as clinically to prevent cancer among high-risk groups. The inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity by NSAIDs plays a role in their anti-tumorigenic properties. NSAIDs also have COX-independent activity, which is not fully understood. Our lab has previously shown that NSAIDs induce other anti-tumorigenic genes including the NSAID-activated gene (NAG-1) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). In this study, we report that sulindac sulfide (SS), a conventional NSAID, down-regulates epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) protein expression in a COX-independent manor; interestingly, this occurs independent of transcriptional regulation. EpCAM is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that has been implemented as an over-expressed oncogene in many cancers including colon, breast, pancreas, and prostate. Oncology & Cancer Cell Biology38EpCAM was recently described to undergo 2 cleavage events, an extracellular cleavage that frees the potentially oncogenic outer portion of the protein, and the release of the intracellular region of EpCAM that complexes with beta-catenin and, once freed, translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription of beta-catenin target genes. NSAID down regulation of pro-tumorigenic EpCAM could provide a novel mechanism to further understand COX-independent NSAID anti-cancer activity. 62. Anti-cancer Activity of Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors in Colorectal Cancer Seong-Ho non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug associated with anti-tumorigenic and pro-apoptotic properties in animal and in vitro models of cancer. How- ever, the underlying cellular mechanisms by which TA exerts its effects are only partially understood. Activat- ing transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a member of the ATF/CREB subfamily of the basic region-leucine zip - per family and has been known as a tumor suppressor in human colorectal cancer cells. The present study was performed to observe whether ATF3 mediates TA-induced apoptosis and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of ATF3 transcription induced by TA. TA treatment and ectopic expression of ATF3 increased apoptosis, whereas knockdown of ATF3 resulted in significant repression of TA-activated apoptosis. The TA treatment induced ATF3 promoter activity. Internal deletion and point mutation of the predicted ATF/C/EBP binding site in ATF3 promoter abolished luciferase activation by TA. Overexpression of ATF2 resulted in significant increase of ATF3 promoter activity, and EMSA identified this region as a core se - quence to which ATF2 binds. TA treatment resulted in an increase of ATF2 phosphorylation, which was followed by a subsequent increase of ATF3 transcription. Knock - down of ATF2 abolished TA-induced ATF3 expression. We further provide evidence that TA leads to increases of phospho-p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK levels. Inhibition of these pathways using selective inhibitors ameliorated TA-induced ATF3 expression and promoter activities. The current study demonstrates that TA stimulates ATF3 expression and subsequently induces apoptosis. These pathways are mediated through phosphorylation of ATF2, mediated by p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK-depen-dent pathways. 63. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Temporomandibular Joint in Normal Dogs Dawn Macready, Silke Hecht, Linden Craig, Gordon Conklin Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences (Macready, Hecht, Conklin), Department of Pathobiology (Craig) Evaluation of the canine temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is important in the clinical diagnosis of animals presenting with dysphagia, malocclusion and jaw pain. In human medicine, MRI is the imaging modality of choice for evaluation of the TMJ. The objectives of this study were to establish a technical protocol for performing MRI on the TMJ in dogs and describe the MRI anatomy and appearance of the normal canine TMJ. Ten dogs (1 fresh cadaver and 9 healthy live dogs) were examined by MRI. MR images were compared to pathologic sections in the of the mandible and mandibular fossa of the temporal bone were hyperintense to muscle and isointense to hypointense to fat on T1 weighted images, mildly hyperintense to muscle on T2 weighted images, and were frequently heterogeneous. The articular disc was visible in 14/20 (70%) and images. The disc was isointense to hyperintense to muscle on T1-W images and varied from hypointense to hyperintense to muscle on T2-W images. The lateral collateral ligament was not identified in any joint. MRI allows evaluation of the osseous and certain soft tissue structures of the TMJ in dogs. Oncology & Cancer Cell Biology3964. Effect of Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment on Canine Mesenchymal Stem Cells Maria Alfred Sciences (Cekanova, Millis, Whitlock, Legendre), Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences (Geiser, Dhar) Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) originate from adult organs, such as bone marrow, or fat and have a capability to self regenerate and differentiate into specific cells of bone, cartilage, muscle, or fat. MSC are used to replace and repair damaged tissue and to induce the healing process. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatment (HBOTx) has been shown to be effective in improving and accelerating the healing process in many diseased tissues; this effect is achieved through several different mechanisms. In our study we proposed to evaluate the canine MSC from fat, bone marrow and peripheral blood and to study the effect of HBOTx on the production of circulating canine MSC into peripheral blood and adipose tissue isolated from adult dogs. This study used 6 healthy dogs where each dog was its own control. Venous blood was withdrawn; bone marrow and fat samples were surgically removed pre- and post- HBOTx with 100% oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres of pressure for 60 minutes for 3 days from each dog. Canine MSC population was isolated and characterized by capacity of MSC differentiation into specific type of cells. Our data indicate that HBOTx caused a significant increase of the production of MSC in bone marrow and then released canine MSC into peripheral blood circulation. Increased circulating pluri-potent MSC may be one of the mechanisms by which HBOT improves tissue healing. 65. Equine Progenitor Cells - Potential Role in Basic and Translation Research Madhu Dhar, Nancy Neilsen, Shannon Eaker, Steve Adair, Dennis of Large (Dhar, (Eaker) Equine regenerative medicine is an exciting but relatively new research field. Adult stem cells, also referred to as multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, are plastic-ad - herent cells that express CD antigen surface markers and demonstrate tri-lineage differentiation potential towards osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts. Adipose tissue, bone marrow and peripheral blood are the com - monly used sources of adult mesenchymal stromal cells. We have established protocols to isolate progenitor stem cells from horse adipose tissue and peripheral blood. We validated them by immunophenotyping using human CD antigen surface markers. After proliferation and expan - sion, the progenitor cells stained positive for CD34, CD45, CD51 and CD90. We have optimized protocols for their in vitro differentiation into osteocytes, adipo - cytes and chondrocytes. This is blue expression of genes. Immunofluo - rescence assays are currently being optimized to identify protein markers specific to the differentiated cell types. 66. Quantitative Analysis of Inflammatory Responses from Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Device Implantation in an Animal Model Patricia Brown, Steve Minkin, Michael Beeler, Benjamin Curry, Linda Cahalan, Pat Cahalan, John Biggerstaff Center for Environmental Biotechnology (Brown, Minkin, Beeler, Department Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can activate circulating blood, resulting in significant inflammation and coagulation in downstream organs. This study sought to design a methodology to quantitatively assess these parameters in several tissues obtained from untreated and ECMO-exposed animals using 3-dimensional fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. After implantation, the animal was observed for 72 hours, and tissue samples were collected from 5 organs from the control animal and 4 organs from the experimental animal. The samples were immunofluorescently stained for fibrin, fibrinogen, platelets and leukocytes and leukocyte activation markers. Cells were quantified using mean fluorescence volumes leukocytes using a seeded segmentation algorithm designed in our laboratory. In comparison to the control animal, there was minimal difference in the accumulation of platelets in the lungs. However, the monocytes and polymorphs in the lungs of the implanted animal displayed a difference in percentage of activated cells 14.32% and 21.93% higher, respectively, compared to the Clinical Sciences40control animal. Percent of activated lymphocytes in the implanted animal were also elevated in comparison to the control animal by a difference of 26.09%. The differences in the amount of fibrin and fibrinogen showed a 0.22% and 0.11%, respectively, in comparison to the control animal. These results show that implantation of ECMO induced a severe inflammatory response in the treated animal, and confirm that we have developed a sensitive quantitative assay for the measurement of inflammatory and clotting parameters. 67. Effect of Order Set Utilization on Outcomes in Septic Shock in the Intensive Care Unit Daniel R. Malcom, Barbara E. Faircloth Department of Pharmacy, UT Medical Center Severe sepsis and septic shock continue to have high morbidity and mortality in emergency departments and intensive care units worldwide. With the publication of the 2008 Surviving Sepsis guidelines, our institution implemented a septic shock order set that included early, goal-directed therapy and many high-level guideline recommendations. No study to date has evaluated the 2008 guidelines specifically included in an order set and their potential impact on mortality outcomes. The purpose of this study is to determine if using a sepsis order set for directed care affects outcomes, and to evaluate secondary predictive factors for mortality in the total population that may be influenced by the order set. Our study is a retrospective cohort analysis comparing patients who received order set-directed care for the treatment of septic shock to those who did not. All patients admitted to the Medical Critical Care service from July 2009 through December 2009 with a diagnosis of septic shock will be included. Exclusion criteria include age less than 18 years or known terminal diagnosis at time of admission. The primary endpoint is all-cause mortality, with secondary endpoint of hospital length of stay. We will also use a multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine potential predictive factors of mortality in these patients. Results and conclusions were incomplete at the time of printing.68. Labor Epidural Fever and Pyrogenic Cytokines Cara Erickson, Stephen Patteson, Carolyn Snyder Department of Anesthesiology (Patteson, Erickson), Department of Anesthesiology Research (Snyder) An association between epidural analgesia in laboring women and maternal fever has been identified. A variety of human cytokines have been identified with inflammation and fever. This study investigates cytokine levels in laboring women prior to and after placement of epidurals. The null hypothesis is that labor epidurals do not elevate inflammatory cytokine levels causing fever. After IRB approval and patient consent, blood was drawn prior to epidural placement and every 4 hours until delivery. Maternal temperature was assessed. Quantitative IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, and GM-CSF levels MAG human cytokine panel (Millipore; Billerica, MA). Six patients were consented. Mean age was 25.0 years \u00b1 7.8, mean gestational age was 38.9 weeks \u00b1 1.0, pre-epidural white blood cell count WBC was 14,800 \u00b1 4.2. The assay kit failed to measure data in 1 patient. All 6 patients had increased temperature from baseline. The range of temperature (T) increase was between 0.9-2.2\u00b0 F. None of the patients developed a fever >100.4\u00b0. There was no statistical significance between baseline and cytokine levels 4 hours after epidural placement. There appeared to be a positive correlation between GM-CSF and maximum temperature after delivery. This is the presentation of the initial patients consented. As the study progresses, we expect to have patients with fever > 100.4\u00b0 F. Human cytokine levels as measured by IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, and GM-CSF do not appear to be elevated by labor epidural placement. 69. Air vs Saline Loss of Resistance for Epidurals-CA1 Residents During Primary Obstetrical Rotation Tony Owens, Stephen K. Patteson Department of Anesthesia Studies have been conducted using experienced anesthe - siologists with and without CSE to determine if the air vs. saline loss of resistance (LOR) method for identifying the epidural space resulted in more favorable outcomes. No Clinical Sciences41study has evaluated if either method results in more suc - cessful epidural placement and fewer complications with CA 1 physician residents during their primary obstetrical rotation. This study evaluated the number of attempts for epidural placement, incidence of intravascular catheters, inadvertent dural puncture, epidural replacement rate for labor analgesia and conversion from epidural to general anesthesia for cesarean section and bilateral tubal ligation. After obtaining IRB approval and patient consent, the CA 1 resident assigned to the obstetrical unit sequentially alternated between the air or saline LOR technique. Anes-thesia records were completed by the residents in compli - ance with standard medico-legal documentation. Patient anesthesia charts were then reviewed by an independent reviewer. Twelve patients were consented and admitted to the study. Four patients had LOR with air and 8 patients LOR with saline. No patient required ephedrine for hypo - tension. No patient required cesarean section for deliv - ery. One patient in the saline group required more than 1 attempt at epidural placement. One patient in the saline group experienced an intravascular catheter placement. One patient in the air group required general anesthesia for bilateral tubal ligation for failed epidural reactivation. There were no statistical differences found between num - ber of attempts at placement, unintentional dural puncture, epidural replacement rate, intravascular catheters, ephed - Observation of Secretin-induced Pancreatic Duct Dilation in Healthy Cats Matthew Baron, Silke Hecht, Andrea Matthews, Jennifer Stokes Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences Secretin is a polypeptide hormone that stimulates secretion of bicarbonate from the exocrine pancreas and, in healthy human subjects, has been shown to cause transient pancreatic duct dilation observable via abdominal ultrasonography. In humans afflicted with chronic pancreatitis, secretin administration fails to cause pancreatic duct dilation, theoretically due to the restrictive effects of periductal fibrosis. This diagnostic test has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in humans. The purpose of this study was to establish the potential effects of exogenous secretin administration on the width of the pancreatic duct in healthy domestic cats. Nine healthy cats were administered a commercially available secretin product (ChiRhoStim) while the pancreatic duct was ultrasonography. Maximum pancreatic duct diameter after secretin stimulation was compared to measurements made prior to injection, and a percentage increase over basal width was calculated. Mean pancreatic duct diameter increased from \u00b1 0.33 mm to 1.42 \u00b1 0.40mm after secretin administration, which was statistically significant (p = 0.0017). The mean percent increase in pancreatic duct diameter over basal diameter for all time points 1 to 15 minutes post secretin administration was duct healthy cats that can be observed via percutaneous ultrasound. Applicability of this technique in cats with chronic pancreatitis will need to be investigated in future studies . 71. A Description of Motion of the Canine Pelvic Limb in 3 Planes Using a New Inverse Dynamics Model Jason Headrick, Songning Zhang, Darryl Millis Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences (Headrick, Millis), Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program (Headrick), Department of Exercise, Sport, and Leisure Studies (Zhang) A new inverse dynamics model was created that derives net joint moments and power from a calculated joint center. The authors hypothesized that this new model would produce an accurate description of motion in the sagital plane and that it would allow for description of motion in the frontal and transverse planes, thus producing the first description of motion in the canine pelvic limb in all 3 planes. Six dogs were outfitted with medial and lateral reflective markers. A static calibration was collected that allowed for identification of joint centers. Radiographs helped identify the hip joint center. Kinetic and kinematic data were collected as the dogs were trotted across a calibrated spaced. An inverse dynamics method was used to describe the joint net moment and power across the pelvic limb in 3 planes. In the sagital plane, the hock experiences the greatest moments and power of all 3 joints. In the frontal plane, the hock and stifle abductors and adductors share equal time in the stance phase and the hip abductors cause the net moment. The moments and power generated in the frontal and transverse planes are one half to one tenth that produced in the frontal plane. Inverse dynamics results derived from joint centers allow for more accurate data. Clinical Sciences42These descriptions of motion in 3 planes allow for a greater understanding of the biomechanics of the canine pelvic limb and may lead to a better understanding and treatment of pathologic processes. 72. Evaluation of Veterinary Nitinol Stents, Vet Stent-Trachea, for the Palliation of Tracheal Collapse in Dogs April M. Durant, Patricia Sura, Barton Rohrbach Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences (Durant, Sura), Department of Comparative Medicine (Rohrbach) This study was designed to retrospectively evaluate the use of the Vet Stent-Trachea for palliation of clinical signs related to tracheal collapse. Our theory was that the Vet Stent would result in improvement of the patient's clinical signs with minimal complications. The medical records database of the UT Veterinary Teaching Hospital was searched for a diagnosis of tracheal collapse. We evaluated 116 medical records for radiographic documentation of tracheal collapse and placement of Vet Stent. Data were collected from 18 medical records. All data comparisons were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Tracheal measurements were compared by a paired t test if normally distributed and a signed rank test if abnormally distributed. Stent measurements immediately after placement and at follow up were also compared by a paired t test. There was a significant difference in the minimum tracheal width when initial and post deployment tracheal widths were compared (p = 0.0005). There was a significant difference in stent length at follow up when compared to immediate deployment (p = 0.001). Owner outcome assessment was available in 18/18 patients, with 11.1% morbidity within 60 days and 16.6% morbidity at 10 months. Use of the Vet Stent-Trachea as a palliative therapy for tracheal collapse is associated with an overall fair to good outcome. The chance of stent fracture is infrequent with this type of nitinol stent, and this stent appears to be effective in relieving clinical signs of tracheal collapse. 73. From Cell Culture to Living Mice-The Use of Mammalian-adapted Bacterial Luciferase as a Target for Bioluminescent Imaging Dan Close, Stacey Patterson, Steven Ripp, Seung Joon Baek, John Sanseverino, Gary (Close, Patterson, Ripp, Sanseverino, Sayler), Genome Science and Technology Program (Close), Department of Pathobiology (Baek) The definitive shortcoming of bacterial luciferase ( lux) is that it is believed to be functional only in prokary - otes. However, this preconception is erroneous. With an emission spectra that is virtually background-free when expressed in a mammalian host and the ability to generate light autonomously, the sensitivity and real-time imaging capacity of bacterial luciferase far surpasses that of the current mainstays of molecular imaging. Since its incep - tion as a prokaryotic reporter protein nearly 2 decades ago, the overarching goal of bacterial luciferase reporter technology has been to expand its sensing repertoire to include eukaryotes. We report here our achievement of this goal by using codon-optimization and bicistronic ex - pression strategies to induce bioluminescence in HEK293 cells expressing the full lux cassette at a rate ~1000 times higher than untransfected cells. These bioluminescent reporter cells were shown stable over prolonged periods, making them ideally suited for general laboratory use. On average, bioluminescent output was 5,400% (\u00b1 1,300) greater in HEK293 cells expressing the entire lux cassette than those transfected with only the luxA and luxB genes. To demonstrate the real-time, reagent-free nature of this system, a bioluminescent mouse model was developed; it was consequently confirmed that bioluminescence was both rapidly detectable (<10 seconds following injection) and free from background over prolonged time periods (>30 minutes post injection). These results demonstrate the potential applications of a mammalian-compatible lux reporter for use in both cell culture and whole animal imaging applications in order to fill the niche created by the shortcomings of the currently available systems.Clinical Sciences4374. Biodistribution of a Novel Radiolabeled Fibril-reactive Monoclonal Antibody In Patients with Systemic Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis Karen Wells , Jonathon Wall, Yitong Fu, Bjoern Jakoby, Steve Kennel, Alan Solomon Department of Radiology (Wells, Fu), Department of Medicine (Wall, Kennel, Solomon), Molecular Imaging and Translational Research Group (Jakoby) The objective of this study was to characterize the biodistribution of I-124 11-1F4, a novel radiolabeled murine monoclonal antibody binds to deposited fibrils in AL amyloidosis, using organ-specific PET time activity curves (TAC) of patients with AL amyloidosis. Eighteen patients with AL amyloidosis underwent PET/CT after IV administration of I-124 11-1F4. Initially, 3 patients were imaged at multiple time points, 1 minute to 14 days post-radiotracer (RT). Subsequent patients were imaged 2 and 5 days post-RT. Biodistribution was assessed with TAC using decay corrected mean activity in regions of interest defining blood pool and individual organs. Ratios of organ specific activity to blood pool activity and to organs not clinically involved with AL amyloidosis (lung and skeletal muscle) were calculated. TAC of I-124 11-1F4 in AL amyloidosis patients demonstrated variability in between patients. Variability of biodistribution likely reflects heterogeneity of clinical disease manifestations. Ratio of radiotracer uptake to blood pool activity proved helpful to define uptake in organs and for comparison of RT uptake between patients. We demonstrated marked and persistent increased I-124 11-1F4 organ-specific uptake in 8 patients including the spleen, liver, lymph nodes, and bone marrow on TAC, suggesting binding of RT to pathologic sites of fibril deposition. Characterization of the biodistribution of I-124 11-1F in patients with AL amyloidosis (1) demonstrated variability between patients and (2) defined organ-specific uptake in some patients. Results reflect heterogeneity of clinical disease manifestations and indicate potential usefulness of a chimeric form of this antibody for immunotherapy.75. Role of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Wang Department of Comparative Medicine Oncogenic induction of the ras genes is widely involved in human cancers. Expression of oncogenic H-Ras in - creases susceptibility of human and mouse cells to HDA - CIs, such as FK228 and trichostatin A, for inducing cas-pase activation and selective apoptosis. To understand the mechanisms for HDACI-induced differential activation of caspases and apoptosis in oncogenic H-Ras-expressing cells, we investigated the role and regulation of ROS in HDACI-induced cell death. We detected that expression of oncogenic H-Ras resulted in potentiating intracellular ROS machinery, increasing the susceptibility to HDACIs for enhancing the production of ROS, and depleting glu - tathione, leading to differential activation of caspases and cell death. Furthering our understanding of how oncogen - ic H-Ras augmented the generation of ROS, we detected that expression of oncogenic H-Ras was able to increase the level of Nox1, a homologue of the catalytic subunit of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase. of inhibitor or specific siRNAs signifi - cantly reduced ROS production induced by oncogenic H-Ras and HDACIs as well as HDACI-induced cell death of oncogenic H-Ras-expressing cells. Our results led us to a suggestion that Nox1 played an important role in the ability of oncogenic H-Ras to potentiate ROS-producing machinery for enhancing cell susceptibility to HDACIs and, in turn, increasing ROS contents leading to caspase activation and selective apoptosis. Differential increases of intracellular ROS by oncogenic H-Ras to potentiate cell death should be seriously considered as a potential target in developing therapeutic strategies to control oncogenic H-Ras-involved human cancers by HDACIs.

Adams, Steven Minkin, John Biggerstaff The Center for Environmental Biotechnology (McCartt, Minkin, Biggerstaff), The Office of Laboratory Animal Care (Coan, Adams) Hypercoagulability is common in many cancers, including melanoma. Melanoma cells and leukocytes express fibrin receptors, and it is hypothesized that a fibrin blockade may prevent interactions between leukocytes and melanoma, leading to immunosuppression. This pilot study examined the efficacy and toxicity of peptides designed to prevent fibrin binding to cognate receptors on melanoma cells and leukocytes in C57BL/6 mice. The peptide sequences bind to fibrin and inhibit its subsequent binding to MAC-1 and ICAM-1, receptors important for adherence and the induction of cytotoxicity in leukocytes and their target tumor cells. In order to determine toxicity of the peptides, 4 mice were injected with 1.5 mg of fluorescently-labeled peptide or 1.5 mg of vehicle. A half-life of 24 hours was determined by measuring plasma separated from blood removed from the submandibular vein using a fluorescence plate reader. Therapeutic efficacy of the peptides was determined by measuring tumor growth and metastases in mice. Primary tumor tissue was cryosectioned and measured for microvessel density by immunohistochemistry for von Willebrand Factor. GFP expressing B16 melanoma cells, and metastasis in the pulmonary tissue were detected by fluorescence microscopy. The primary tumor growth of the peptide-treated group was inhibited by 69.3% (+/- 28%), in addition to a 47.9% (8.3%) reduction in metastases of the lungs, when compared to the vehicle. These results clearly show that fibrin inhibitory peptides were effective in reducing tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, and suggest their possible use as adjuvant therapeutic agents in cancer immunotherapy.77. Alternative Splicing of Kr\u00fcppel-like Factor 4 Plays a Role in Colorectal Tumorigenesis Jae Bahn, Seong-Ho Lee, Seung Joon Baek Department of Pathobiology Most human genes undergo alternative splicing, and many abnormal splicing processes are associated with human diseases. However, the molecular relationship between alternative splicing and tumorigenesis is not well understood. Here, we found novel Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) splicing variants produced by exon skipping in several human cancer cell lines. One of splicing variants, small KLF4 (KLF4S), localizes in the cytoplasm and activity of wildtype KLF4 (KLF4L). Interestingly, sulindac sulfide treatment restored KLF4L expression, and this is mediated by dephosphorylation of RNA binding motif 5 (RBM5). Overexpression or knockdown of RBM5 altered the splicing ratio of KLF4. Our data suggest that RBM5 plays a pivotal role in the alternative splicing of KLF4, and these splicing variant forms may impact tumorigenesis. 78. Modeling the Effect of Melanoma Tumor Cell Growth in the Presence of Natural Killer Cells Ann Wells, Sharon Bewick, John Biggerstaff, Kara Kruse, Richard C. Ward Department of Nutrition (Wells, Biggerstaff), NiMBIOS (Be - wick), Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Sciences and Engineer - ing Division (Kruse, Ward) A major challenge in the mathematical modeling of biological processes is the development of appropriate, physiologically-relevant experimental systems that can yield results readily usable as input parameters for mathematical models. We therefore designed an experimental system to investigate the interactions of immune cells with tumors. This yielded a defined set of numerical parameters for input into a simple mathematical model of cancer immunity, using human melanoma cells, natural killer (NK) cells, cell receptors and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Tumor growth tends to increase in the presence of soluble MICA (a tumor cell receptor) but decreases when high levels of MICA bind to the tumor cell. MMPs putatively induce tumor cell shedding of MICA and facilitate degradation of the ECM. Our novel cell migration system was devised based on Oncology & Cancer Cell Biology45this model and included MMPs, soluble MICA, tumor cells, NK cells and ECM. During the assay, cells were followed by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. We used image analysis software to obtain quantitative and qualitative data (cell number, cell density, cell viability, cell migration pathways, velocity, etc.). The experimental system yielded results derived from the interaction of NK cells with a growing tumor mass over time, and showed how changes in cell-surface molecule expression and ECM can moderate these interactions. This system simulates the progression of tumor invasion by immune cells in vivo. Based on our studies, we expect that by changing selected biological parameters, we can verify the mathematical model or modify it to be reassessed through the experimental setup. 79. Safety and Efficacy of a Novel Method of Localized Hyperthermia Delivery in Conjunction with Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Non-resectable Canine and Feline Sarcomas: A Pilot Study Olya Smrkovski, Aknine Jerard, Jeffrey Phillips Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences Soft tissue sarcomas are a locally invasive group of cancers that occur in both veterinary and human patients. These tumors are treated with aggressive surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. In some cases, this approach is not possible because of tumor location, size, or both. In addition, tumors that are refractory to aggressive therapy represent a particular therapeutic challenge. Therefore, a need exists for novel therapeutic approaches. Recent and historic literature has shown that the use of hyperthermia (tumor exposure to temperatures over 42\u00b0 C) as an adjuvant to chemotherapy results in improved tumor control in a variety of locally advanced malignancies. However, the delivery of the precise amount of heat to the tumor while sparing normal tissues has been challenging. This problem was solved with the discovery of metamaterials, dielectrics that can interact with and control electromagnetic radiation. Recent technologic advances allowed us to develop a hyperthermia delivery device (iTherm 2000) that uses the unique properties of metamaterials. This device contains a conformal ultrawideband metamaterial lens applicator that is able to provide efficient, focused, deep-penetrating low-cost clinical hyperthermia. We have assessed the safety and activity of chemotherapy and hyperthermia in a pilot study in 11 pet animals (6 dogs and 5 cats). We observed clinical responses in all patients. Treatment-related toxicity was observed in 3 out of 6 dogs and 1 out of 5 cats. These findings suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and hyperthermia delivered with iTherm 2000 has a promise as a novel therapeutic approach for non-resectable sarcomas. 80. Expression of KIT and PDGFR in Canine Anal Sac Adenocarcinoma Using Tissue Immunohistochemistry Rebecca J Brown , Shelley J. Newman, Amy K. LeBlanc Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences (Brown, LeB - lanc), Department of Pathobiology (Newman) Apocrine gland adenocarcinoma is invasive malignancy, paraneoplastic hypercalcemia occurs in 25-50% a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that targets several members family, including VEGFR-2 (Flk-1/KDR), with measurable anal sac adenocarcinoma have responded to treatment with Pal - ladia. The objective of this study was to evaluate archived, paraffin-embedded canine anal sac adenocarcinomas for immunohistochemical PDGFR. The UT Department of Pathobiology histopathology archives were searched for anal sac adenocarcinoma tis - sue samples. A total of 77 samples were examined by immunohistochemistry for c-kit and PDGFR expression and assigned a grade based on the intensity and pattern of staining with: (0) <50% of cells positive with weak expression, (1) <50% of cell positive with intense expres - sion, (2) >50% of cells positive with weak expression, (3) >50% of cells positive with intense expression. Two of the 77 samples positively expressed c-Kit, with Grade 1 ex - pression. Fifteen of the 77 samples positively expressed PDGFR, 14 had Grade 1 expression and 1 had Grade 3 expression. These results suggest that c-Kit and PDGFR may not have a significant role in mediating the response of anal sac adenocarcinomas to Palladia. To further ana-lyze the role of Palladia for the treatment of this cancer, studies should be done to investigate the presence of these markers in biopsy material and their eventual response to therapy, and the role of VEFGR-2 in this cancer. Oncology & Cancer Cell Biology4681. Serial 18FDG-PET/CT Can Assess Response to Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition in Canine Cancer Amy K. LeBlanc, Federica Morandi, Ashley N. Miller, Jonathan S. Wall, Gina D. Galyon, Tammy Moyers, Misty Long, Alan Stuckey Department Small Animal Clinical Sciences (LeBlanc, Morandi, Miller, Galyon, Moyers), Molecular Imaging and Translational Research Program, Graduate School of Medicine (LeBlanc, Wall, Long, Stuckey) PalladiaTM (toceranib phosphate, Pfizer Animal Health) is a novel receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor approved for treatment of canine mast cell disease. Dysregulated RTKs induce tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. PalladiaTM has been shown to target vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR-2/Flk-1/KDR), platelet derived growth factor receptor, and Kit. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is commonly used to diagnose and monitor response to anti-neoplastic therapy in cancer patients. In this study, serial PET/CT imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) was used to assess response to PalladiaTM therapy in 7 dogs with measureable solid malignancies. Dogs underwent whole body contrast-enhanced PET/CT (4.547\u00b10.77 mCi, mean \u00b1SD) using a 64-slice PET/CT scanner. Six dogs were imaged at baseline with PET/CT; one dog underwent CT only at baseline. All dogs underwent PET/CT at a median of 5.5 weeks post-baseline. Two dogs underwent additional PET/CT scans at 14 weeks, and at 10 and 15 weeks post-baseline, respectively. Images were correlated to treatment response. One dog demonstrated significant clinical improvement at first recheck and was maintained on drug despite dose modification due to toxicity; measureable clinical and image-based response was seen after 12 weeks of therapy. All other dogs demonstrated stable or progressive disease based on follow-up clinical staging and PET/CT at first recheck. Scan results agreed with clinical assessment of externally measurable disease. Palladia therapy was continued in patients with stable disease and acceptable drug tolerance and was discontinued in non-responsive patients. PET/CT with 18FDG can be used to monitor clinical response to Palladia. 82. Genetic Approach to Improve Fertility in Cattle Fernando Di Croce, Arnold Saxton, Daniel Casanova, Neal Schrick College of Veterinary Medicine, University of the Center of the Buenos Aires Province (Di Croce, Casanova), Department of Animal Science (Di Croce, Saxton, Schrick) In spite of the economic importance of fertility and increased knowledge of reproductive biology in the cow, efficiency of reproductive performance has continued to decline in dairy cattle. Improvements in fertility through genetic selection may be a possible approach to increase reproductive efficiency in dairy cattle. The objectives of this study were to (1) estimate genetic parameters and breeding values for fertility traits from a Holstein population and (2) develop a multi-trait selection index (dollar fertility value, $F) based on estimated breeding values. Data representing 3,282,843 lactations and 1,622,088 animals were used for the analysis and obtained from official records maintained by the Argentinean Holstein Association. Days open (DO), calving interval (CI), age to first calving (AFC), and daughter pregnancy rate (DPR) were traits chosen for genetic parameter estimation. Multiple-trait, derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood (MTDFREML) was used to estimate covariance components. The proposed selection index ($F) included AFC and CI, with economic weights from -0.28 and -4.9 $/year per cow, respectively. Heritabilities for DO and DPR ranged from 2 to 7%; CI ranged from 3 to 8%; and AFC was 16%. Predicted transmitting ability values across different lactations ranged from -18.5 to 15.8 days, -23.15 to 16.0 days, -4.0 to 4.6%, and -120.3 to 76.2 days for DO, CI, DPR, and AFC, respectively. Values for $F ranged from -$89.16 to $147.12 in this Holstein population. Results indicate substantial variation in fertility traits, suggesting that genetic selection may be effective in improving declines in fertility. Oncology & Cancer Cell Biology4783. Effect of Reproductive Tract Size on Conception Rates in Lactating Dairy Cows Utilizing a Reproductive Tract Scoring System Charles D. Young, Fernando A. Di Croce, David A. Roper, Jessica P. Harris, F. Neal Schrick Department of Animal Science, UTIA Reproductive Research Program (Young, Di Croce, Roper, Harris, Schrick) Tennessee AgResearch (Young) Reproductive tract scoring (RTS) systems have been effective in evaluating fertility of heifers. A similar RTS system has not been reported in lactating dairy cows (LDC) pertaining to fertility. Objectives of this study include the development of an RTS system for LDC and determining if RTS has an effect on artificial insemination (AI) success with semen type (conventional [CS] vs. sexed [SS]). Prior to estrus, cows were assigned an RTS (1, 2, or 3) by at least 2 experienced palpators. Reproductive tracts for RTS 1 were small, compact, and resting within the pelvic cavity; RTS 2 were intermediate in size and resting partially outside the pelvic cavity; RTS 3 were large, deep tracts resting nearly entirely outside the pelvic cavity. Cows (n = 1822 inseminations) were artificially inseminated with either CS (n = 1621) or SS (n = 201). Pregnancy was determined by transrectal palpation or ultrasonography at 28-45 days post-AI for determination of conception rate (CR). The highest numerical CR with respect to RTS was observed in RTS 1, followed by RTS 2 and RTS 3 (29.7%, 26.5%, 26.6%, respectively, p = 0.5771). Regardless of RTS, conception rates of CS (31.4%) were higher than SS (23.4%, p = 0.0525). Conception rates were higher for RTS 1 (38.4%) compared to RTS 3 (23.8%) with CS (p = 0.0176). RTS 1 conception rates were higher for CS (38.4%) compared to SS (22.3%, p = 0.0272). No differences were detected in conception rates using SS. These results indicate the detection of smaller tracts can improve fertility in LDC when using CS. 84. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction for Simultaneous Detection of Mastitis Pathogens Directly from Milk Barbara E. Gillespie , Megan L.Maxwell, Daniel Scholl, Stephen P. Oliver Department of Animal Science (Gillespie, Maxwell, Oliver), Canadian Bovine Mastitis Research Network, Quebec, Canada (Scholl) Mastitis is the most common and most costly disease of dairy cattle in the United States. A real-time PCR multiplex assay for detection of mastitis pathogens has been developed in our laboratory. The objective of the present study was to evaluate this real-time PCR assay for detection of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, multiplex assay targeted the following genes: cfb gene encoding the CAMP factor for S. agalactiae , nuc gene for S. aureus, the plasminogen activator gene for S. uberis, and the wec A gene targeting E. coli . Quarter milk samples from clinical (n = 1471) and subclinical (n = 1307) mastitis previously evaluated by the Canadian Bovine Mastitis Research Network by conventional microbiological methods were used to evaluate the real-time PCR procedure. Milk samples were enriched with trypticase soy broth and incubated overnight. Isolation of bacterial DNA from milk used a technique modified in our laboratory. Multiplex real-time PCR was performed in a Bio-Rad to detect mastitis pathogens from clinical mastitis samples was much lower than the sensitivity (90%) and specificity (98.01%) to detect mastitis pathogens from subclinical mastitis samples. Results of this study indicate that the multiplex real-time PCR procedure has the potential to be a valuable diagnostic technique for simultaneous identification of commonly isolated mastitis pathogens directly from quarter milk samples. Even with overnight enrichment, real-time PCR can reduce identification time by at least 24 hours compared to conventional microbiological methods.Bovine Diseases & Theriogenology85. Characterization of the Immune Response Following Vaccination of Dairy Cows with Recombinant Streptococcus uberis Adhesion Molecule (rSUAM) Raul A. Almeida, Maria E. Prado, Douglas A. Luther, Susan I. Headrick, Mark J. Lewis, Hugh Moorehead, Stephen P. Oliver Department of Animal Science (Almeida, Prado, Luther, Headrick, Oliver), Dairy Research and Education Center, Lewisburg, TN (Moorehead) Research conducted in our laboratory on the pathogenesis of Streptococcus uberis mastitis led to the discovery of a novel virulence factor, referred to as SUAM. Further research showed that antibodies directed against rSUAM inhibited adherence to and internalization of S. uberis into mammary epithelial cells, placing rSUAM as a promising antigen for the control of S. uberis mastitis. To design an effective vaccine formulation, we compared the safety and humoral immune response (IgG) induced by Seppic ISA780). For this experiment, 5 cows per each formulation and a control group (n = 4) were vaccinated 28 days before dry off (D-28), at dry off (D0) and 28 days after dry off (D+28). Serum samples were obtained every 2 weeks from D-28 to 28 days after calving (C+28). Rectal temperature and local reaction measurements were obtained 3 times during the 1st week and every 2 weeks after each subsequent vaccination. Result obtained showed that IgG response induced by SV70-rSUAM was significantly higher than the control (rSUAM alone) or the rest of the vaccine formulations tested. Local reaction induced by SV70-rSUAM was no different than the rest of the vaccine formulations with the exception of the second vaccination, where the local reaction of SV70-rSUAM was significantly higher than the rest. Results of this study led to the selection of SV70-rSUAM for an upcoming vaccination study, which includes challenge of vaccinated and control cows with homologous and heterologous S. uberis strains.86. pGhost9:ISS1 Transpositional Mutations in Bacterial Adherence to and Internalization Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells Oudessa Kerro Dego, Maria Prado, Raul Almeida, Xue Chen, Douglas Luther, Stephen Oliver Department of Animal Science Streptococcus uberis is an important mastitis pathogen that affects dairy cows worldwide. Pathogenic strategies and associated virulence factors of S. uberis are not well understood. S. uberis attaches to and internalizes into mammary epithelial cells and can survive inside cells for extended periods. We hypothesize that early attachment to and internalization into mammary epithelial cells is a critical step for the establishment of infection. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize chromo - somally encoded virulence factors of S. uberis that are involved in early attachment to and internalization into mammary epithelial cells. We identified virulence factors by generating random transposon insertion mutants that are defective in adherence and internalization using the pGhost9:ISS1 mutagenesis system. Random transposon insertion mutant of S. uberis UT888 screened, 32 had significantly reduced ability to adhere to and internalize into mammary epi - thelial cells. Integration of the transposon into the chro - mosome of these mutant clones was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot. Chromosomal mapping of transposon integration sites and identification and characterization of insertionally inactivated genes are currently being done using improved methods of inverse PCR that uses prim - ers on either end of the transposon. By sequencing the inverse PCR products, we found that some mutant clones had transposon integration into penicillin binding protein 2A (pbp2A), phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase catalytic subunit (purE), lactose phosphotransferase and a few other genes.
