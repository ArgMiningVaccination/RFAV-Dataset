Dr. Benedict Lust coined the term 'naturopathy' in the late 1800's in America, at a time when naturopathy was used by a growing profession of doctors and healers who used European and American botanical medicines, homeopathy, physiotherapy, and water cure therapy. Today, the science of naturopathic medicine is an ever-evolving, vital and holistic system of modern medicine rooted in this historical wisdom. Naturopathic medicine is an art, a philosophy, a science, and an integral healthcare practice of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness using natural, non-toxic, & non-invasive therapies. Naturopathic physicians must attend a 4-year residential medical school, and are trained in traditional medical sciences and clinical studies as well as in the therapeutic sciences of nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathic medicine, and hands-on physical medicine. Naturopathic physicians are licensed in Rhode Island to use natural therapies to promote health & wellness for patients.
