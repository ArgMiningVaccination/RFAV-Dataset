(2)(a) A state agency or authorized local government may create a single general small works roster, or may create a small works roster for different specialties or categories of anticipated work. Where applicable, small works rosters may make distinctions bet ween contractors based upon different geographic areas served by the contractor. The small works roster or rosters sh all consist of all responsible contractors who have requested to be on the list, and where required by law are properly licensed or registered to perform such work in this state. A state agency or local government establishing a small works roster or rosters may require eligible contractors desiring to be placed on a roster or rosters to keep current recor ds of any applicable licenses, certifications, registrations, bonding, insurance, or other appropriate matters on file with the state agency or local government as a condition of being placed on a roster or rosters. At least once a year, the state agency or local government shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdic tion a notice of the existence o f the roster or rosters and solicit the names of contractors for 1428 JOURNAL OF THE HOUSE such roster or rosters. In a ddition, responsible contractors shall be added to an appropriate roster or rosters at any time they submit a written request and necessary records. Master contracts may be required to be signed that become effective when a specific award is made using a small works roster. (b) A state agency establishing a small works roster or rosters shall adopt rules imp lementing this subsection. A local government establishing a small works roster or rosters shall adopt an ordinance or resolution implementing this subsection. Procedures incl uded in rules adopted by the department of enterprise ser vices in implementing this subsection must be included in any rules providing for a small works roster or rosters th at is adopted by another state agency, if the authority for that state agency to engage in these activities has been delegated to it by the department of enterprise services under chapter 43.19 RCW. An interlocal contract or agreement between two or more state agencies or local governments establishing a small works roster or rosters to be used by the partie s to the agreement or contract must clearly identify the lead e ntity that is responsible for implementing the provisi ons of this subsection. (c) Procedures shall be established for securing telephone, written, or electronic quotations from contractors on the appropriate small wor ks roster to assure that a competitive price is established and to award contracts to the lowest responsible bidder, a s defined in RCW 39.04.010. Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished. However, detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the invitation. This subsection does not eliminate other requirements for architectural o r engineering approvals as to quality and compliance with building codes. Quotations may be invited from all appropriate c ontractors on the appropriate small works roster. As an alternative, quotations ((may)) must be invited from at least five contractors on the appropriate small works roste r who have indicated the capability of performing the kind of work being contracted, in a manner that will equitably distribute the opportunity among the contractors on the appropriate roster. However, if the estimated cost of the work is from ((one)) two hundred fifty thousand dollars to three hundred fifty thousand dollars, a state agency or local govern ment that chooses to solicit bids from less than all the appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster must also notify the remaining contractors on the a ppropriate small works roster that quotations on the work are being sought. The government has the sole option of determining whether this notice to the remaining contract ors is made by: (i) Publishing notice in a legal newspaper in general circulation in the area where the work is to be done; (ii) mailing a notice to these contractors; or (iii) sending a notice to these contractors by facsimile or other electronic means. For purposes of this subsection (2)(c), \"equitably di stribute\" means that a state agency or local government soliciting bids may not favor certain contractors on the appropriate small works roster over other contractors on the ap propriate small works roster who perform similar services. (d) A contract awarded from a small works roster under this section need not be advertised. (e) Immediately after an award is made, the bid quotations obtained shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available by ((telephone inquiry)) electronic request. (f) For projects awarded under the small works roster process established under this subsection, a state agency or authorized local government may waive the retainage requirements of RCW 60.28.011(1)(a), thereby assuming the liability for contractor's nonpayment of: (i) Laborers, mechanics, subcontractors, materialpersons, and suppliers; and (ii) taxes, increas es, and penalties under Title s 50, 51, and 82 RCW that may be due from the contractor for the project. However, the state agency or local government has the right of recovery against the contractor for any payments made on the contractor's behalf. Recovery of unpaid wages and benefits are the first priority for actions filed against the retainage. (3)(a) In lieu of awarding contracts under subsection (2) of this section, a state agency or authorized local government may award a contract for work, construction, alteration, repair, or improvement projects estimated to cost less than ((thirty-five)) fifty thousand dollars using the limited public works process provided under this subsection. Public works projects awar ded under this subsection are exempt from the other requirements of the small works roster process provided under su bsection (2) of this section and are exempt from the requirement that contracts be awarded after advertisemen t as provided under RCW 39.04.010. (b) For limited public works projects, a state agency or authorized local government shall solicit electronic or written quotations from a minimum of three contractors from the appropriate small works roster and shall award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder as defined under RCW 39.04.010. After an award is made, the quotations shall be open to public inspectio n and available by electronic request. A state agency or authorized local government ((shall attempt to)) must equita bly distribute opportunities for limited public works projects ((equitably)) among contractors willing to perform in the geographic area of the work. A state agency or author ized local government shall maintain a list of the contractor s contacted and the contracts awarded during the previous twenty-four months under the limited public works process, including the name of the contractor, the contractor's r egistration number, the amount o f t h e c o n t r a c t , a b r i e f d e s cription of the type of work performed, and the date the contract was awarded. For limited public works projects, a state agency or authorized local government may waive the payment and performance bond requirements of chapter 39.08 RCW and may waive the retainage requirements of ((chapter 60.28)) RCW 60.28.011(1)(a), thereby assuming the liability for the contractor's nonpayment of laborers, mechanics, subcontractors, materialper sons, suppliers, and taxes ((imposed under Title)), incre ases, and penalties imposed under Titles 50, 51, and 82 RCW that may be due from the contractor for the limited public works project, however the state agency or authorized local government shall have the right of recovery against the c ontractor for any payments made on the contractor's behalf. EIGHTIETH DAY, APRIL 3, 2019 1429 (4) The breaking of any project into units or accomplishing any projects by phases is prohibited if it is done for the purpose of avoiding the maximum dollar amount of a contract that may be let using the small works roster process or limited public works process. (5)(((a) A state agency or authorized local government may use the limited public works process of subsection (3) of this section to solicit and award small works roster contracts to small businesses that are registered contractors with gross revenue s under one million dollars annually as reported on th eir federal tax return. (b) A state agency or authorized local government may adopt additional procedures to encourage small businesses that are registered contractors with gross revenues under two hundred fifty thousand dollars annually as reported on their federal tax returns to submit quotations or bids on small works roster contracts. (6) As used in this section,)) A state agency or authorized local government m ay use the limited public works process in this section t o s o l i c i t a n d a w a r d s m a l l works roster contracts to minibusinesses and microbusinesses as defined under RCW 39.26.010 that are registered contractors. (6) The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise. (a) \"Equitably distributes\" means that a state agency or authorized local government may not favor certain contractors on the appropriate s mall works roster over other contractors on the same roster who perform similar services. (b) \"State agency\" means the department of enterprise services, the state parks and recreation commission, the department of natural resources, the department of fish and wildlife, the department of transportation, any institution of higher education as defined under RCW 28B.10.016, and any other state agency delegated authority by the dep artment of enterprise services to engage in construction, bui lding, renovation, remodeling, alteration, improvement, or repair activities. Sec. 6. RCW 39.12.040 and 2013 c 113 s 5 are each amended to read as follows: (1)(a) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, before payment is made by or on behalf of the state, or any county, municipality, or political subdivision created by its laws, of any sum or sums due on account of a public works contract, it is the duty of the officer or person charged with the custody and disbursement of public funds to require the contractor and each and every subcontractor from the contractor or a subcontractor to submit to such officer a \"Statement of Intent to Pay Prevailing Wages\". For a contract in excess of ten thousa nd dollars, the statement of intent to pay prevailing wages must include: (i) The contractor's registr ation certificate number; and ( i i ) T h e p r e v a i l i n g r a t e o f w a g e f o r e a c h classification of workers ent itled to prevailing wages under RCW 39.12.020 and the estimat ed number of workers in each classification. (b) Each statement of inte nt to pay prevailing wages must be approved by the industrial statistician of the department of labor and industries before it is submitted to the disbursing officer. Unless otherwise authorized by the department of labor and indus tries, each voucher claim submitted by a contractor for payment on a project estimate must state that the prevailing wages have been paid in accordance with the prefiled statement or statements of intent to pay prevailing wages on file with the public agency. Following the final acceptance of a public works project, it is the duty of the officer charged with the disbursement of public funds, to require the contractor and each and every subcontractor from the contractor or a subcontractor to submit to such officer an affida vit of wages paid before the funds retained according to the provisions of RCW 60.28.011 are released to the contractor. On a public works project where no retainage is withheld ((pursuant to RCW 60.28.011(1)(b))), the affidavit of wages paid must be submitted to the state, county, municipality, or other public body charged with the duty of disbursing or authorizing disbursement of public funds prior to final acceptance of the public works project. If a subc ontractor performing work on a public works project fails to submit an affidavit of wages paid form, the contractor or subcontractor with whom the subcontractor had a contractual relationship for the project may file the forms on be half of the nonresponsive subcontractor. Affidavit forms may only be filed on behalf of a nonresponsive subcontractor who has ceased operations or failed to file as required by this section. The contractor filing the affidavit must accept responsibility for payment of prevailing wages unpaid by the subcontractor on the project pursuant to RCW 39.12.020 and 39.12.065. Intentionally filing a false affidavit on behalf of a subcontractor subjects the filer to the same penalties as are provided in RCW 39.12.050. Each affidavit of wages paid must be certified by the industrial statis tician of the department of labor and industries before it is submitte d to the disbursing officer. (2) As an alternate to the p rocedures provided for in subsection (1) of this section, for public works projects of two thousand five hundred dollars or less and for projects where the limited public works process under RCW 39.04.155(3) is followed: (a) An awarding agency may authorize the contractor or subcontractor to submit the statement of intent to pay prevailing wages directly to the officer or person charged with the custody or disbursement of public funds in the awarding agency without approval by the industrial statistician of the department of labor and industries. The awarding agency must retain su ch statement of intent to pay prevailing wages for a period of not less than three years. (b) Upon final acceptance of the public works project, the awarding agency m ust require the contractor or subcontractor to submit an a ffidavit of wages paid. Upon receipt of the affidavit of wages paid, the awarding agency may pay the contractor or subc ontractor in full, including funds that would otherwise be retained according to the 1430 JOURNAL OF THE HOUSE provisions of RCW 60.28.011. Within thirty days of receipt o f t h e a f f i d a v i t o f w a g e s p a i d , t h e a w a r d i n g a g e n c y m u s t submit the affidavit of wag es paid to the industrial statistician of the department of labor and industries for approval. (c) A statement of intent to pay prevailing wages and an affidavit of wages paid must be on forms approved by the department of labor and industries. (d) In the event of a wage claim and a finding for the claimant by the department of labor and industries where the awarding agency has used the alternative process provided for in this subsection (2), the awarding agency must pay the wages due directly to the cla imant. If the contractor or subcontractor did not pay the wag es stated in the affidavit of wages paid, the awarding agency may take action at law to seek reimbursement from the c ontractor or subcontractor of wages paid to the claimant, and may prohibit the contractor or subcontractor from bidding on any public works contract of the awarding agency for up to one year. (e) Nothing in this section may be interpreted to allow an awarding agency to subdivide any public works project of more than two thousand five hundred dollars for the purpose of circumventing the procedures required by subsection (1) of this section. Sec. 7. RCW 54.04.070 and 2017 c 85 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: (1) Any item, or items of the same kind of materials, equipment, or supplies purchas ed, the estimated cost of which is in excess of ((fifteen)) thirty thousand dollars, exclusive of sales tax, shall be by contract. However, a dis trict m a y m a ke pur chas es of the s am e k ind o f i tem s of materials, equipment, and supplies not exceeding ((seven)) twelve thousand ((five hundred)) dollars in any calendar month without a contract, pur chasing any excess thereof over ((seven)) twelve thousand ((five hundred)) dollars by contract. (2) Any work ordered by a district commission, the estimated cost of which is in excess of ((twenty-five)) fifty thousand dollars, exclusive of sal es tax, shall be by contract. However, a district commission may have its own regularly employed personnel perform work which is an accepted industry practice under prudent utility management without a contract. For purposes of this section, \"prudent utility management\" means perform ing work with regularly employed personnel utilizin g material of a worth not exceeding ((one)) three hundred ((fifty)) thousand dollars in value without a contract. This limit on the value of material being utilized in work being performed by regularly employed personnel shall not inc lude the value of individual items of equipment ((purchased or acquired and used as one unit of a project)). For the purposes of this section, the term \"equipment\" includes but is not limited to conductor, cabling, wire, pipe, or lines used for electrical, water, fiber optic, or telecommunications. (3) Before awarding a contract required under subsection (1) or (2) of this s ection, the commission shall publish a notice once or more in a newspaper of general circulation in the district at least thirteen days before the l ast date upon which bids will be received, inviting sealed proposals for the work or materi als. Plans and specifications for the work or materials shall at the time of publication be on file at the office of the district and subject to public inspection. Any published notice ordering work to be performed for the district sha ll be mailed at the time of publication to any established trade association which files a written request with the district to receive such notices. The commission may, at the same time and as part of the same notice, invite tenders for the work or materials upon plans and specifications to be submitted by the bidders. (4) As an alternative to the competitive bidding requirements of this section and RCW 54.04.080, a district may let contracts using the sm all works roster process under RCW 39.04.155. (5) Whenever equipment or materials required by a district are held by a governme ntal agency and are available for sale but such agency is unwilling to submit a proposal, the commission may ascertain the price of such items and file a statement of such price supported by the sworn affidavit of one member of the commission, and may consider such price as a b id without a de posit or bond. (6) Pursuant to RCW 39.04.280, the commission may waive the competitive bidding requirements of this section and RCW 54.04.080 if an exemption contained within RCW 39.04.280 applies to the purchase or public work. (7)(a) A district may procure public works with a unit priced contract under thi s section, RCW 54.04.080, or 54.04.085 for the purpose of completing anticipated types of work based on hourly rates or unit pricing for one or more categories of work or trades. (b) For the purposes of this section, unit priced contract means a competitively bid contract in which public works are anticipated on a recurring basis to meet the business or operational needs of a district, under which the contractor agrees to a fixed period indefinite quantity delivery of work, at a defined unit price, for each category of work. (c) Unit priced contracts must be executed for an initial contract term not to exceed three years, with the district having the option of extending or renewing the unit priced contract for one additional year. (d) Invitations for unit price bids shall include, for purposes of the bid evaluation, e stimated quantities of the anticipated types of work or trades, and specify how the district will issue or release w ork assignments, work orders, or task authorizations pursuant to a unit priced contract for projects, tasks, or other work based on the hourly rates or unit prices bid by the contractor. Where electrical facility construction or improvement work is anticipated, contractors on a unit priced contract shall comply with the requirements under RCW 54.04.085 (1) through (5). Contracts must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder as per RCW 39.04.010. EIGHTIETH DAY, APRIL 3, 2019 1431 (e) Unit price contractors shall pay prevailing wages for all work that would otherwise be subject to the requirements of chapter 39.12 RCW.

(1) In 2018, the legislature passed Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill No. 6529. The bill recognized that farmers, farmworkers, and the broader community sha re an interest in minimizing human exposure to pesticides. I t also recognized that gains have been made in reducing human exposure to pesticides and that collaboration between state agencies and the farming community could further reduce agricultural workers exposure to pesticide drift. (2) The legislation established a pesticide application safety work group that would make recommendations for improving pesticide application safety. Work group members in cluded legislators from both chambers and caucuses, as well as representation from state agencies and the commission on Hispanic affairs. The work group sought public participat ion to learn more about pesticide application safety. Many stakeholders including but not limited to local farm hosts, the agricultural industry, and members of the agricultu ral workforce contributed valuable assistance and input. (3) The work group reached two noteworthy recommendations regarding what can be done now to improve pesticide application safety. The recommendations are to: 1438 JOURNAL OF THE HOUSE (a) Expand training because the department of agriculture lacks sufficient resources to meet the training demand from pesticide app licators and handlers; and (b) Establish a new pestic ide application safety panel to provide an opportunity to evaluate and recommend policy options, and inve stigate exposure cases.

April 2, 2019 E2SSB 5116 Prime Sponsor, Committee on Ways & Means: Supporting Washington's clean energy economy and transitioning to a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future. Reported by Committee on Finance MAJORITY recommendation: Do pass as amended by Committee on Finance and without amendment by Committee on Environment & Energy. Strike everything after the enacting clause and insert the following: \"NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that Washington must address the impacts of climate change by leading the transition to a clean energy economy. One way in which Washington must lead this transition is by transforming its energy supply, modernizing its electricity system, and ensuring that the benefits of this transition are broadly shared throughout the state. (2) With our wealth of carbon-free hydropower, Washington has some of the cleanest electricity in the United States. But electricity remains a large source of emissions in our state. We are at a critical juncture for transforming our electricity system. It is the policy of the state to eliminate coal-fired electricity, transition the state's electricity supp ly to one hundred percent carbon-neutral by 2030, and one hundred percent carbon-free by 2045. In implementing this chapter, the state must prioriti ze the maximization of family wage job creation, seek to ensure that all customers are benefiting from the transition to a clean energy economy, and provide safeguards to ensure that the achievement of this policy does not impair the reliability of the electricity syste m or impose unreasonable cost s on utility customers. (3) The transition to one hundred percent clean energy is underway, but must ha ppen faster than our current policies can deliver. Absent sig nificant and swift reductions in greenhouse gas emission s, climate change poses immediate significant threats to our economy, health, safety, and national security. The prices of clean energy technologies continue to fa ll, and are, in many cases, competitive or even cheaper than conventional energy sources. (4) The legislature finds that Washington can accomplish the goals of this act while: Promoting energy independence; creating high-quality jobs in the clean energy sector; maximizing the value of hydropower, our principal renewable resource; continuing to encourage and provide incentives for clean alternative energy sources, including providing electricity for t he transportation sector; maintaining safe and reliable electricity to all customers at stable and affordable rates; and protecting clean air and water in the Pacific Northwest. Clean energy creates more jobs per unit of energy produced than fossil fuel sources, so this transition will contribut e to job growth in Washington while addressing our climate crisis head on. Our abundance of renewable energy and our strong clean technology sector EIGHTIETH DAY, APRIL 3, 2019 1483 make Washington well positioned to be at the forefront of the transition to one hundred percent clean electricity. (5) The legislature declares that utilities in the state have an important role to play in this transition, and must be fully empowered, thr ough regulatory tools and incentives, to achieve the goals of this policy. In combination with new technology and emerging opportunities for customers, this policy will spur transformational change in the utility industry. Given these changes, the legislature recognizes and finds that the utilities and transportation commission's statutory grant of authority for rate making includes consideration and implementation of performance and incentive-based regulation, multiyear rate plans, and other flexible regulatory mechanisms where appropriate to achieve fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient rates and its public interest objectives. (6) The legislature recognizes and finds that the public interest includes, but is not limited to: The equitable distribution of energy benefits and reduction of burdens to vulnerable populations and highly impacted communities; long-term and short-term public health, economic, and environmental benefits and the reduction of costs and risks; and energy security and resiliency. It is the intent of the legislature that in achieving this policy for Washington, there should not be an increase in environmental health impacts to highly impacted communities. (7) It is the intent of the legislature to provide flexible tools to address the variability of hydropower for compliance under this act. NEW SECTION. Sec. 2.

(f) Nonemitting electric generation resources used to meet the standard under (a) of this subsection must be generated during the compliance period and must be verified by documentation that the elect ric utility owns the nonpower attributes of the electricity generated by the nonemitting resource. (g) Nothing in this section prohibits an electric utility from purchasing or exchanging power from the Bonneville power a dministration. (2) Investments in energy transformation projects used to satisfy an alternative compliance option provided under subsection (1)(b) of this section must use criteria developed by the department of ecology, in consultation with the department and the commission. For the purpose of crediting an energy transformation project toward the standard in subsection (1)(a) of this section, the department of ecology must establish a conversion factor of emissions reductions resulting from energy transformation projects to megawatt-hours of electricity from nonemitting electric generation that is consistent w ith the emission factors for unspecified electricity, or for energy transformation projects in the transportation sector , consistent with default emissions or conversion fact ors established by other jurisdictions for clean alternative fuels. Emissions reductions from energy transfo rmation projects must be: (a) Real, specific, identifiable, and quantifiable; (b) Permanent: The department of ecology must look to other jurisdictions in setting this standard and make a reasonable determina tion on length of time; (c) Enforceable by the state of Washington; (d) Verifiable; (e) Not required by another statute, rule, or other legal requirement; and (f) Not reasonably assumed to occur absent investment, or if an investment has already been made, not reasonably assumed to occur absent additional funding in the near future. (3) Energy transforma tion projects must be associated with the consumption of energy in Washington and must not create a new use of fossil fuels that results in a net increase of fossil fuel usage. (4) The compliance eligibility of energy transformation projects may be scaled or prorated by an approved protocol in order to d istinguish effects related to reductions in electricity usage from reductions in fossil fuel usage. (5) Any compliance obligation fulfilled through an investment in an energy transformation project is eligible for use only: (a) By the electric utility that makes the investment; (b) if the investme nt is made by the Bonneville power administration, by electric utilities that are preference customers of the Bonneville power administration; or (c) if the investment is made by a joint operating agency organized under chapter 43.52 RCW, by a member of the joint operating agency. An electric utility making an investment in partnership with another electric utility or entity may claim credit proportional to its share invested in the total project cost. (6)(a) In meeting the standard under subsection (1) of this section, an electric utility must, consistent with the requirements of RCW 19.285.040, if applicable, pursue all cost-effective, reliable, a nd feasible conservation and efficiency resources, and demand response. In making new investments, an electric utility must, to the maximum extent feasible: (i) Achieve targets at the lowest reasonable cost, considering risk; (ii) Consider acquisition of existing renewable resources; and (iii) In the acquisition of new resources constructed after the effective date of this section, rely on renewable resources and energy storage, insofar as doing so is consistent with (a)(i) of this subsection. (b) Electric utilities subject to RCW 19.285.040 must demonstrate pursuit of all conservation and efficiency resources through compliance with the requirements in RCW 19.285.040. (7) An electric utility that fails to meet the requirements of this section must pay the administrative penalty established under section 9(1) of this act, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. (8) In complying with this section, an electric utility must, consistent with the re quirements of RCW 19.280.030 and section 25 of this act, ensure that all customers are benefiting from the transition to clean energy: Through the equitable distribution of energ y and nonenergy benefits and reduction of burdens to vulne rable populations and highly impacted communities; long-term and short-term public 1488 JOURNAL OF THE HOUSE health and environmental benefi ts and reduction of costs and risks; and energy security and resiliency. (9) Affected market customers must comply with the standard established under subs ection (1) of this section. (10) A market customer that purchases electricity exclusively from carbon-free resources and eligible renewable resources, as def ined in RCW 19.285.030 as of January 1, 2019, pursuant to a special contract with an investor-owned utility approved, prior to the effective date of this section, by order of the commission is subject to the requirements of such an order and not to the standard established in this section. For purposes of interpreting any such special contract, chapter 19.285 RCW, as in effect on January 1, 2019, is not, either dir ectly or indirectly, amended or supplemented. (11) To reduce costs for utility customers or avoid exceeding the cost impact limit in section 6(3)(a) of this act, a multistate electric utility with fewer than two hundred fifty thousand customers in Washington may apply the total amount of megawatt-hour of coal -fired resources eliminated from the utility's allocation of electricity before December 31, 2025, as an equivalent a mount of megawatt-hour of nonemitting electric generation or electricity from renewable resources require d to comply with subsection (1)(a) of this section. The uti lity must demonstrate that for every megawatt-hour of early action credit there is a real, permanent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the western interconnection directly associated with that credit. A multistate electric utility must request to use early compliance credit in its clean energy implementation plan that is submitted under section 6 of this act. The multistate electric utility must specify in its clean energy implementation plan the complia nce years to which the early action compliance credit will ap ply, but in no event may the multistate electric utility use the early action compliance credits beyond 2035. The commission must establish conditions for use of early action compliance credits, including a determination of whether action constitutes early action, before the multistate electric utility's use of early action compliance credits in a clean energy implementation plan.

All costs included in the determination of cost impact must be directly attributable to actions necessary to comply with the requirements of sections 4 and 5 of this act. (b) If an investor-owned utility relies on (a) of this subsection as a basis for comp liance with the standard under section 4(1) of this act, then it must demonstrate that it has maximized investments in renewable resources and nonemitting electric generation prior to using alternative compliance options allowed under section 4(1)(b) of this act. (4)(a) A consumer-owned utility must be considered to be in compliance with the standards under sections 4(1) and 5(1) of this act if, over th e four-year comp liance period, the average annual incremental cost of meeting the standards or the interim targets establis hed under subsection (2) of this section meets but does not exceed a two percent increase of the consumer-owned utility's retail revenue requirement above the previous year. All costs included in the determination of cost impact must be directly attributable to actions necessary to comply with the requirements of sections 4 and 5 of this act. (b) If a consumer-owned util ity relies on (a) of this subsection as a basis for comp liance with the standard under section 4(1) of this act, and it has not met eighty percent of its annual retail electric load using electricity from renewable resources and nonemitting electric generation, then it must demonstrate that it has maximized investments in renewable resources and none mitting electric generation prior to using alternative compliance options allowed under section 4(1)(b) of this act. (5) The commission, for investor-owned utilities, and the department, for consumer-owned utilities, must adopt rules establishing the methodology for calculating the incremental cost of complia nce under this section, as compared to the cost of an alternative lowest reasonable cost portfolio of investments that are reasonably available. NEW SECTION. Sec. 7. (1) Each electric utility must disclose its greenhouse ga s content calculation in conformance with this section. A utility's disclosure must be consistent with the fuel sources that it reports and discloses in compliance with chapter 19.29A RCW. The department must by rule incorporate the carbon content disclosure into the power source or fuel mix disclosure required under chapter 19.29A RCW. (2) For unspecified electricity, the utility must use an emissions rate determined, and periodically updated, by the department of ecology by rule. The department of ecology must adopt an emissi ons rate for unspecified electricity consistent with the emissions rate established for other markets in the weste rn interconnection. If the department of ecology has not a dopted an emissions rate for unspecified electricity, the emissions rate that applies for th e purposes of this chapter is 0.437 metric tons of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity. (3) For the purposes of this act, the fuel mix calculated for the Bonnevill e power administration may exclude any purchases of electric generation that are not associated with load in t he state of Washington. NEW SECTION. Sec. 8. By January 1, 2024, and at least every four years thereafter and in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the department must submit a report to the legislature. The report mu st include the following: (1) A review of the standards described in sections 3 through 5 of this act focused on technologies, forecasts, and existing transmission, and an evaluation of safety, environmental and public safet y protection, affordability, and system reliability.

(b) A qualifying utility may count distributed generation at double the facilit y's electrical output if the utility: (i) Owns or has contracted for the distributed generation and the associated renewable energy credits; or (ii) has contracted to purchase the associated renewable energy credits. (c) In meeting the annual targets in (a) of this subsection, a qualifying utility shall calculate its annual loa d based on the average of the utility's load for the previous two years. (d) A qualifying utility shall be considered in compliance with an annual target in (a) of this subsection if: (i) The utility's weather-adjusted load for the previous three years on average did not increas e over that time period; (ii) after December 7, 2006, the u tility did not commence or renew ownership or increment al purchases of electricity from resources other than coal transition power or renewable r e s o u r c e s o t h e r t h a n o n a d a i l y s p o t p r i c e b a s i s a n d t h e electricity is not offset by equivalent renewable energy credits; and (iii) the utility i nvested at least one percent of its total annual retail revenue requirement that year on eligible renewable resources, renewa ble energy credits, or a combination of both. (e) ((The requirements of thi s section may be met for any given year with renewable energy credits produced during that year, the preceding year, or the subsequent year. Each renewable energy credit may be used only once to meet the requirements of this secti on)) A qualifying utility may use renewable energy credits to meet the requirements of this section, subject to the limit ations of this subsection.

Sec. 1. (1) The Washington state legislature is purposefully d esigned to be a part-time legislature to provide people from all areas of life the opportunity to participate. All b usinesses and industries, in the private and public sector, benefit when the legislature is made up of the broadest possible representation. (2) It is a significant public policy to encourage citizens to serve in the legislature. However, serving as a legislator is often demanding and time consuming, and most legislators have other employment to support themselves and their families. (3) Other states have enacted legislation addressing the duties and responsibilities of legislators and prospective legislators in relation to their regular employment. The intent of this act is to align Washington law with that of other similar states with part-time legislatures. It is already a cri me in Washington to intimidate a public servant in an attempt to influence the public servant's vote, opinion, decision, or other official action. It is the intent of this chapter to crea te a civil remedy to ensure that legislators are able to remain independent, and not face undue influence from their outside employers, by being able to take a leave of absence from outside employment to serve the public interest during regular and special l egislative sessions.

(2) The leave of absence under this chapter may be unpaid. An employer may allow an employee to use accrued paid leave to which the employee is entitled for any part of the leave provided under this chapter. (3) An employee who seeks leave under this chapter must provide the employer with notice of the employee's intention to take leave: (a) At least thirty days before a regular legislative session; and (b) As soon as it is reasonably apparent that a special legislative session will be called. (4) An employer is not required to grant a leave of absence if: (a) The employee does not provide notice as required by subsection (3 ) of this section; (b) The employee was employed by the employer for less than ninety days immediately before the first day of the leave of absence; or (c) The employment is on a temporary basis. NEW SECTION. Sec. 4. (1) No employer may discharge or threaten to dischar ge, intimidate, or coerce any employee if the employee seeks leave under this chapter. (2) At the end of the leav e of absence under this section, an employee must be restored to the same employment position the employ ee held immediately before the first day of the leave of absence without loss of seniority , the right to participate in insurance, or any other employment benefits, if the pos ition still exists. If the position does no t still exist, the employee must be restored to as similar a position as possible, without loss of seniority, the right to participate in insurance, or an y other employment benefits. (3) The protections of this section do not apply if: (a) The employee does not return to employment within: (i) Fifteen days after adjournment sine die of a regular legislative session; or ( i i ) F i v e d a y s a f t e r a d j o u r n m e n t o f a s p e c i a l legislative session; or (b) The circumstances of the employer have so changed during the leave of absence as to make a return to employment impossibl e or unreasonable.

(1) If an employer violates the provisions of this chapter, the employee may bring a civil action, at his or her own expense, in superior court for damages and an order requiri ng the reinstatement of the employee. A prevailing employee is entitled to costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. Pub lic resources may not be used, directly or indirectly, to bri ng or maintain a civil action under this section.

Strike everything after the enacting clause and insert the following: \"NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. SHORT TITLE. This act may be known and cited as the Washington privacy act of 2019. NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. (1) The legislature finds that: (a) Washington explicitly r e c o g n i z e s i t s p e o p l e ' s right to privacy under Article I, section 7 of the state Constitution. Nothing in this act diminishes this right. (b) There is rapid growth in the volume and variety of personal data being genera ted, collected, stored, and analyzed. The protection of i ndividual privacy and freedom in relation to the processing of personal data requires the 1526 JOURNAL OF THE HOUSE recognition of the principle that consumers retain ownership interest of their personal data, including personal data that undergoes processing or is in p ossession of another party. Consumers desire greater trans parency and control over the collection, disclosure, and shar ing of their personal data. (c) Nothing in this act affects the consumer protections in chapter 19.86 RCW, the consumer protection act. (d) Personal data should be collected with a clear purpose and with consumers' consent. (2) Possession of personal data brings with it an obligation of care and to fulfill requirements under this act, no matter the source of data, or the size of the entity holding or processing personal data. To preserve trust and confidence that personal data will be protected appropriately, the legislature recognizes that with regard to processing of personal data, Wa shington consumers have the rights to: (a) Confirm whether or not personal data is being processed by a controller; (b) Obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing processing; (c) Correct inaccurate personal data; (d) Obtain deletion of personal data; (e) Restrict processi ng of personal data; (f) Be provided with any of the consumer's personal data that the consumer p rovided to a controller; (g) Object to processing of personal data; and (h) Not be subject to a decision based solely on profiling. (3) The European Union recently updated its privacy law through the passage and impl ementation of the general data protection re gulation, affording its residents the strongest privacy prote ctions in the world. (4) Washington residents have long enjoyed an expectation of privacy in their public movements. The development of new technology like facial recognition could, if deployed indiscriminately and without proper regulation, enable the cons tant surveillance of any individual. Washington resident s should have the right to a reasonable expectation of pri vacy in their movements, and thus should be free from ubi quitous and surreptitious surveillance using facial recognition technology. Further, Washington residents have the r ight to information about the capabilities, possible bias, and limitations of facial recognition technology and that it should not be deployed by private sector organizations w ithout proper public notice. NEW SECTION. Sec. 3. DEFINITIONS. The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise. (1) \"Affiliate\" means a legal entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, another legal entity. (2) \"Business purpose\" means the processing of a consumer's personal data with the consumer's consent for the controller's or its processor' s operational purposes, provided t h a t t h e p r o c e s s i n g o f p e r s onal data must be reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the operational purposes for which the perso nal data was collected or processed or for another operational purpose that is compatible with the context in which the personal data was collected. Business purposes include: (a) Detecting security inc idents, protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, prosecuting those responsible for that activity, and notifying consumers of illegal activity that impacts personal data; (b) Identifying and repairing errors that impair existing or intende d functionality; (c) Short-term, transient use, provided the personal data is not disclosed to another third party and is not used to build a profile about a consumer or otherwise alter an individual consumer's experience outside the current interaction including, but not limited to, the contextual customization of ads shown as part of the same interaction; (d) Maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, processing payments, or providing financing; (e) Undertaking internal r esearch for technological development, if c onducted with deidentified data; or (f) Authenticating a consum er's identity at the request of the consumer or for compliance with this act. (3) \"Child\" means any natural person under thirteen years of age.

RCW 71.24.585 and 2017 c 297 s 12 are each amended to read as follows: ((The state of Washington declares that there is no fundamental right to medicati on-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.)) (1)(a) The state of Washington ((further)) declares that ((whi le medications used in the treatment of opioid use disord er are addictive substances, that they nevertheless have sev eral legal, important, and justified uses and that one of th eir appropriate and legal uses is, in conjunction with other req uired therapeutic procedures, in the treatment of persons w ith opioid use disorder. The state of Washington recognizes as evidence-based for the management of opioid use di sorder the medications approved by the federal food and drug administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder. Medication-assisted treatment should only be use d for participants who are deemed appropriate to need this level of intervention. Providers must inform patient s of all treatment options available. The provider and the patient shall consider alternative treatment options, like abstinence, when developing the treatment plan. I f medications are prescribed, follow up must be included in the treatment plan in order to work towards the goal of abstinence.)) substance use disorders are medical conditions. Substance use disorders should be treated in a manner similar to other medical conditions by using interventions that are supported by evidence. There is a large body of evidence that medications approved by the federal food and drug administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder are highly effective for reducing deaths from opioid overdose and increasing medical outcomes in treatment . I t i s a l s o r e c o g n i z e d t h a t many individuals have multiple substance use disorders, as well as histories of trauma, developmental disabilities, or mental health conditions.

(4) It is not in the public or the clients' interests for hospitals to be used for client s that do not have medical needs.

Reported by Committee on Health Care & Wellness MAJORITY recommendation: Do pass as amended. Strike everything after the enacting clause and insert the following: \"NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature finds and declares: (1) It is the public policy of this state to provide the maximum access to reproductive health care and reproductive health care cove rage for all people in Washington state. (2) In 2018, the legislature passed Substitute Senate Bill No. 6219. Along with reproductive health care coverage requirements, the bill mandate d a literature review of barriers to reproductive health care. As documented by the report submitted to the legislature on January 1, 2019, young people, immigrants, people living in rural communities, transgender and gender nonc onforming people, and people of color still face significant barriers to getting the reproductive health care they need. ( 3 ) I m m i g r a n t s i n W a s h i n g t o n s t a t e a r e a v i t a l contributor to the culture, economy, and life of the people of Washington. Yet federal law p rohibits some immigrants, who would otherwise be eligi ble for medical coverage, from receiving the health benefits and timely access to health care provided through federally funded coverage programs. (4) This lack of coverage negatively affects the reproductive health, family planning, and reproductive autonomy of excluded immigrants living in Washington state. (5) Washingtonians who are transgender and gender nonconforming have important reproductive health care needs as well. These needs go unmet when, in the process of seeking care, transgender and gender nonconforming people are stigmatized or are denied critical health services because of their gender identity or expression. (6) The literature review mandated by Substitute Senate Bill No. 6219 found that, \"[a]ccording to 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey data, thirt y-two percent of transgender respondents in Washington State reported that in the previous year they did not see a doctor when needed because they could not afford it.\" (7) Existing state law shoul d be enhanced to ensure greater coverage of and timely access to reproductive health care for the benefit of all Washingtonians, regardless of immigration status, or gende r identity or expression. (8) Because stigma is also a key barrier to access to reproductive health care, all W ashingtonians, regardless of gender identity or immigrati on status, should be free from discrimination in the provision o f health care services, health care plan coverage, and in access to publicly funded health coverage. (9) All people should have access to robust reproductive health services to maintain and improve their reproductive health. 1564 JOURNAL OF THE HOUSE NEW SECTION. Sec. 2.

Reported by Committee on Local Government MAJORITY recommendation: Do pass as amended. Strike everything after the enacting clause and insert the following: \"NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. FINDINGS AND INTENT. (1) The legislature makes the following findings: (a) Washington state is experiencing a housing affordability crisis. Many communities across the state are in need of more housing options for renters. (b) Accessory dwelling units are one of the best housing affordability tools that support homeownership and address long-standing issues o f intergenerational poverty. (c) Accessory dwelling units typically rent below market rate compared to new constructed apartments, providing additional affordable housing options for renters. (d) Accessory dwelling units also help to provide housing for very low-income households. More than ten percent of accessory dwelling units in some areas are occupied by tenants who pay no rent at all; among these tenants are grandparents, adul t children, family members with disabilities, and friends going through life transitions. Accessory dwelling units meet the needs of these people who might otherwise require subsidized housing space and resources needed by other households. (e) Homeowners who add an accessory dwelling unit to their property may benefit from added income and an increased sense of security, as well as enabling them to stay in their home. (f) Accessory dwelling units can also benefit neighborhoods by expanding rental options near public amenities such as schools, p arks, and transit without changing the look and feel of existing neighborhoods. (g) Accessory dwelling units may reduce economic displacement in existing communities by expanding the range of available housing options and prices, provided that the units are utilized for permanent housing rather than for short-term rental, such as to tourists, or for business uses. (h) Accessory dwelling units are a housing choice that provides environmental benefits. They promote energy conservation compared with a verage size si ngle-family homes. In addition, the sitin g of additional accessory dwelling units near transit hubs can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (i) Removing certain regulatory barriers to the construction of accessory dwell ing units, such as inflexible design standards and siting rest rictions, may substantially reduce construction costs, thereby enabling more homeowners to add accessory dwelling units to their properties. The increased availability of accessory dwelling units will provide benefits to homeowners, renters, the community, and the environment. (2) The legislature intends to promote and encourage the creation of accessory dwelling units as a means to address the need for additional affordable housing options. The legislature intends that lo cal governments sh all continue to have full authority to: Regulate accessory dwelling units to ensure that they are utilized for permanent affordable housing; regulate or bar accessory dwelling units for use in any zone or area as short-term visitor businesses or any other business use; prevent speculati on leading to displacement or loss of affordable home purchase options; preserve environmental values; and ap ply local landlord-tenant ordinances, including antidi scrimination provisions or provisions requiring acceptan ce of housing vouchers or noncash governmental or nonprofit supported housing payments, and safety and health codes.
