Clin Infect Dis ; 2022 Jun 24. Artigo of [public health surveillance]and [pandemic]control, especially among the unvaccinated, as the nation resumes in- [person]activities.This study examined the relationships between [COVID-19 testing]rates, testing positivity rates and Estimates were used. 3,114 US counties were analyzed from January through September 2021. [Associations]among the testing [metrics]and [vaccination coverage]were estimated using multiple [linear regression]models with fixed effects for states and adjusted for county demographics. [COVID-19 testing]rates ( [PCR]testing per 1,000), testing positivity (percentage of [PCR]tests that were positive), and [vaccination coverage](percentage county [population]that was fully vaccinated). RESULTS:Nationally, median daily [COVID-19 testing]rates were highest in January and September (35.5 and 34.6 tests per capita, respectively) and lowest in July (13.2 tests per capita). Monthly testing positivity was between 0.03 and 0.12 percentage points (pp) lower for each pp of [vaccination coverage], and monthly testing rates were between 0.08 and 0.22 tests per capita higher for each pp of [vaccination coverage]. CONCLUSIONS:The quantity of counties having [populations]with relatively lower [protection]against the [virus]are conducting less testing than counties with relatively more [protection]. [Monitoring]testing practices in relation to [vaccination coverage]may be used to monitor the sufficiency of LILACS LIS "}
