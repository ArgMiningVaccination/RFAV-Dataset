Posted June 23, 2010 If you ask [NCCAM](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/#types), the National Center for Complementary and [Alternative Medicine](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/integrative-medicine), they'll tell you it's a field that \"uses a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms.\" The standard treatment approaches used in mind-body medicine include [meditation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/meditation), prayer, and creative outlets.

Now, he wasn't advocating total hedonism - quite the contrary. He (and his more modern happiness theorists) contended that true happiness is not momentary gratification but the natural outcome of a life well lived. I happen to agree with Socrates. So while this blog will cover many ways to approach stress in body and mind, we'll also spend plenty of time examining ways to be happier. Here's a way to start thinking about being happy in your own life: for the next 7 days, right before bed, write down 3 good things that happened that day and why they happened.
