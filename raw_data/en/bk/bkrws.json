UNDERSTAND. DECIDE. The COVID-19 vaccine is our shot for a healthier tomorrow. We can end this pandemic. TOGETHER. The vaccination is our shot to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and return to life as it was. When more people are vaccinated, more people stay healthy, businesses reopen and communities can reconnect. Getting vaccinated is an opportunity to protect yourself\u2014and others.COVID-19 can take lives\u2014 the COVID-19 vaccine will save lives VACCS FACTS AT A GLANCE: There are no live viruses in the COVID-19 vaccine; recipients are not at risk of catching the disease. COVID-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way. You cannot get sick with COVID-19 from the authorized vaccinations. Getting vaccinated not only protects you, but those around you. If you're deciding if the vaccine is right for you, talk to friends, healthcare providers and people you trust. The decision is personal; educate yourself. Don't miss your shot to learn the facts.LEARN. UNDERSTAND. DECIDE. Prevention is protection\u2014 why vaccination is important Learn more, know more\u2014ending a pandemic is a group effort and requires using all tools available. The COVID-19 vaccine is a safe, effective way to protect our communities. When people do not get the virus, they cannot spread the virus\u2014which is why vaccination is so important to help end the COVID-19 pandemic. You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine The COVID-19 vaccines do not use any form of the virus. The vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19 without having to give people the actual illness. How population immunity is achieved When enough people are immune to a disease, it cannot be spread. Population immunity protects entire communities and is especially needed to protect those unable to get the vaccination themselves, like young children and people with medical conditions. Long-term protection beats possible short- term side effects Decide to protect yourself, your family and your community with the COVID-19 vaccine. After the shot, some people develop side effects. This is normal and means the body is building immunity against COVID-19. Symptoms could last a day or two and may include chills, fatigue, headache, fever, muscle or joint pain, diarrhea, vomiting or redness or swelling at the injection site. Cough, shortness of breath, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose are not expected symptoms of the vaccine. Testing for COVID-19 is recommended even if these symptoms arise within 48 hours of the vaccine. About the COVID-19 vaccine Are there live viruses in the COVID-19 vaccine? No. There are not live viruses in the vaccine. Can I get COVID-19 from the vaccine? No. The vaccine does not contain the live virus; you cannot get COVID-19 from it. After vaccination, how long does it take to be immune? If it has been less than two weeks since your shot, or if you still need to get your second shot, you are NOT fully protected. Keep taking all prevention steps until you are fully vaccinated (two weeks after your final shot.) How was the COVID-19 developed so quickly? Technologies behind the vaccine were built on decades of research and experience. Before the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, scientists had researched similar coronaviruses called SARS and MERS. This past research provided a head start to develop the COVID-19 vaccination. Was the COVID-19 vaccine tested enough? Testing for the vaccine was extensive\u2014no safety steps were skipped. Before trials, there is usually a lot of administrative work\u2014submissions, answering questions from regulatory agencies, etc.\u2014that can take up to a year before actual testing can begin. Because COVID-19 is a public health emergency, scientists were allowed to skip this more clerical step and strictly do the research needed. There were no risky shortcuts. Another advantage that helped expedite the process was the collaboration of scientists throughout the world working around the clock. This teamwork meant the data, research and trials were shared which helped reach a vaccination sooner. Does the vaccine change your DNA? No. The vaccine teaches your cells how to recognize and fight COVID-19. It doesn't impact the part of the cell where the DNA is. Can the vaccine track me? No. There is no tracking technology in the vaccine. "}
