Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community, We hope the new academic year has gotten off to a fantastic start for you. Many of you are already aware that a new strain has caused an uptick in COVID cases across the nation. In the interest of everyone's health and safety, we want to remind you please not to go to class or work if you are feeling sick. This includes if you think you have a cold or the flu as we hope to minimize the spread of all these illnesses on campus. Should you need to stay home, be sure to contact your professors or supervisor to make arrangements. If you need to get a COVID test, they are available at most area drugstores, walk-in clinics and Quest Diagnostics by making an appointment. Students can also get tested at student health services at 5520 Park Avenue, Suite WP1-700 (available by shuttle). Health services is open weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., except for 12:30 to 1 p.m. You do not need to notify public safety, student health services or human resources if you test positive for COVID. We encourage everyone to get a flu shot this fall. There is also an updated COVID booster coming out soon that has been developed to combat the most recent strain. As we have in the past, we will look to the [CDC for COVID guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html). Wishing you a great SHU year, The Coronavirus Planning Team SHU Medical Reserve Corps Established in 2012, Sacred Heart University's Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) is the only college MRC unit in Connecticut and one of 15 college-based MRC units throughout the United States. Volunteers can be part of the solution to protecting people against COVID-19 by supporting many aspects of the vaccination process.

Anti-Stigma Statement In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were a number of news reports regarding stereotyping, harassment and bullying directed at persons perceived to be of a race or ethnicity connected with the virus. At Sacred Heart University, we reiterate our stance of zero tolerance for ethnic harassment or bullying. Some who have tested positive for the virus have also been blamed for being sick and/or spreading the virus. At Sacred Heart, we actively work to create an inclusive and welcoming community so it is important to state more broadly that we do not tolerate any kind of harassment or bullying here. At Sacred Heart, we also stand against any type of stigma related to COVID-19 vaccination status. Vaccinated or unvaccinated, we are all one community, and we are confident that as we work together to keep the community safe, there will be no discrimination or discussion on anyone's vaccination status, decision or need to wear a mask or their need to isolate or quarantine. Our core values include the promotion of the common good of society and the recognition of the dignity and worth of every human being. In this spirit -- the Pioneer spirit -- we take a stand against any type of stigmatization related to COVID-19.
