These brands are making fragrance better for you and the planet.", "sitename": "Ethos", "date": "2023-06-20", "cleaned_text": "These fragrance brands are redefining clean scents with natural, non-toxic perfume ingredients that are better for your body and the planet. Scents are transformative, magical, even. But the perfume industry is filled with toxic chemicals labeled as \"trade secrets\" that can put our health at risk, not to mention the health of the planet. A growing number of brands are working to address this with clean fragrances void of harmful chemicals, and sustainable practices re-shaping the industry. Prestige fragrance brands are taking queues, too, at least on the sustainability front. [Chanel](https://the-ethos.co/no-1-de-chanel-clean-beauty/) is now packaging its No. 5 perfume in a recycled glass bottle \u2014 a feat more difficult than it sounds. Its caps are also biodegradable. L'Or\u00e9al recently created Polo Earth for the Ralph Lauren fragrance collection (it's now on this list, too). The Polo Earth fragrance is vegan, using a plant-based alcohol as well as being 97 percent natural origin ingredients. Its packaging and wooden cap have been certified by The Forest Stewardship Council. Lanc\u00f4me recently opened [Le Domaine de la Rose](https://the-ethos.co/lancome-biodiversity-le-domaine-de-la-rose/) in Grasse, France \u2014 a nearly ten-acre plot where it's growing organic roses and other fragrance ingredients as part of its sustainability commitments. What ingredients are in traditional fragrances? About 4,000 different natural and synthetic ingredients are currently used in fragrances. Unfortunately, what ingredients are used in certain perfumes is often unknown\u2014and some blends can have as many as 300 ingredients. Perfume formulas are often classified as proprietary information so that companies do not have to share their formulations.FDA regulations don't apply to fragrances, which essentially exempts the fragrance brands from listing their ingredients. Because of the proprietary nature of fragrance formulations, brands can hide behind the term \"parfum\" and keep their ingredient lists on lockdown. This leads to dirty and questionable ingredients lurking in our scents. Hormone-affecting ingredients such as oxybenzone and phthalates have been found in many traditional perfumes; these can be harmful to both humans and the planet, according to the Environmental Working Group's [Skin Deep database](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/). A recent study found that more than 1,300 ingredients were [flagged for potential concerns](https://www.womensvoices.org/fragrance-ingredients/report-unpacking-the-fragrance-industry/) including seven carcinogens and 15 chemicals already prohibited from use in cosmetics in the E.U. Clean fragrance ingredients On the flip side, there is a wave of [clean perfume companies](https://the-ethos.co/eauso-vert-clean-luxury-fragrance/) leading with sustainable and natural ingredients as well as ingredients transparency. Though terms like \"clean\" and \"natural\" are used interchangeably there is a slight difference in them all. \"Clean\" refers to fragrances made without harmful ingredients, while \"natural\" is often found on products made from ingredients extracted from raw materials. When shopping for a clean fragrance, these terms are all important. Furthermore, many \"clean\" perfume brands are crafted without the use of toxic materials such as phthalate, parabens, as they can have health consequences. In place of these questionable ingredients, clean perfume brands use natural formulas crafted with ingredients such as essential oils and plant-based alcohol bases. Some of these brands do use synthetic ingredients but opt for ones that have been tested to be safe and sustainable to use. The Best Clean Perfume Brands 1. Henry Rose Founded by actress [Michelle Pfeiffer](https://the-ethos.co/michelle-pfeiffer-clean-perfume-henry-rose/), Henry Rose boasts seven exquisite scents keeping in mind health, sustainability, transparency, and good manufacturing practices.
