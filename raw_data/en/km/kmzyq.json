The quality of a pencil is based on the grade of the lead in it. \u00b7 B, 2B, 3B, 4B: Pencil marked with such grades are much soft and black. \u00b7 HB: Pencil marked with such letters are medium soft and black. \u00b7 H, 2H, 3H, and 4H: Lead in pencil marked by such grade is hard. Higher the number prefixed to the letter 'H', harder is the lead. Curre ntly, these lead pencils are broadly used during drawing. 2) Drawing Board -The drawing board is crafted from high quality processed planks of pinewood or similar types of wood. The planks used are typically of narrow width and the surface of the board is fo rmed by attaching multiple narrow planks to each other seamlessly. 3) Ruler/Scale - It is made up of fine quality wood, plastic, or steel. Centimeter and millimeter lines are indicated or marked on scale. The scale is used to derive measurements. These scale s are available in various measuring range like 15 cm, 30 cm, 1 meter , as per requirement. 4) Protractor -Protractor is made up of plastic or wood. They are available in both shapes: semi -circular or circular. These are tailored in small and big sizes based o n purpose of use. The protractor is used to meet or align a specific angle at a desired location in a drawing. 5) Set Square -Set-square is a right angled triangular plate. It can be of two types i) 30 - 60- 90 ii) 45 - 90- 45. The angles of one of the t riangles are 300, 600 and 900 whereas the second has 450, 900 and 450. The name of each square is derived from the smallest angle present in it. They are made from MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 2 plastic in general. The set square is used to draw perpendicular, vertical, oblique, and pa rallel lines. 6) T-Square -They are usually made from plastic or wood. As it looks like English alphabet 'T', it is called T -Square. It has two parts: the first stock / base and the other blade. The blade is mounted on the stock/base with the help of a screw, such that the edge of the stock/base forms a perfect right angle (90 ) with the edge of blade. Additionally, it is used to provide a parallel support to one edge of a Set Square while drawing perpendicular lines on the other edge of the Set Square. 7) French Curve - It is used to draw irregular curve lines 8) Drawing Paper -These papers are specially formulated and are machine - made. They are of unique thickness, flexibility, strength and white in color. These papers are available in market in various sizes. e.g. A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5. 9) Drawing pins/clips - Drawing pins or clips are used to retain drawing paper stable on the drawing board. 10) Eraser -Eraser is used to erase unwanted lines drawn by the pencil during drawing. This erasing process prevents any potential damage to surface of drawing board. 11) Sharpener, Polish/Sand Paper -Sharpener and/or Polish/Sand Paper is used to achieve a specific/desired tip for pencil. 12) Mini Drafter - Generally, a mini drafter is widely extensively (abundantly) used during drawing. A mini -drafter is designed by a combination of T -Square, Set Square and Protractor. This makes drawing easier and accomplish task rapidly. 13) Compass box -It contains items mentioned below: Pencil Compass (used to draw circular lines) & Divider. Line Types and Their Uses - 1) Thick 2) Medium 3) Thin Figure 1 - T square Figure 1 - Mini Drafter MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 3 Drawing is a language of architecture and lines. It should be universally readable / understandable by anyone without an y ambiguity. Hence, the drawing lines have specific rules and meaning. That 's why we can easily understand the specified/suggested information in a drawing drafted in accordance with the designated rules. The purpose of drawing is to provide shape, size, a nd measurements of an object; however, line -work must achieve it. So, to conceive correct understanding of lines, let us go over the types of lines and rules pertaining to their usage. There are three types of lines. 1) Thick Line - 2) Dashed / Dotted Line - 3) Thin Line - Types of lines and their use in engineering drawing is as mentioned below: 1) Dimension Line or Extension Line and Section Line - These lines are thin and faint. These lines are used as dimension line, extension line, section line to depict surface of the section. Thin 2) Object Line -This line is thick and bold. It is used to show th e actual visual look of the object. These lines should be distinctly visible in the line work of drawing. As these lines depict edges and shape/size of the object, these are known as 'Object Lines '. Thick 3) Dashed line -This line is medium thick and bold. It is used to show parts that are not visible in the diagram. This type of line is drawn in the form of closely placed, small equidistant segments of equal length. This line is also used to show invisible ed ges. Dashed/ Dotted 4) Centre Line - This line is thin and faint. This line is drawn in the centre of the diagram. Therefore, it is called 'Centre Line '. Similarly, this line is used to show the centre of a part. Like a circular part, shaft, or hole. Thin 5) Cutting Plane Line -This line is thick and straight in the end while faint elsewhere. It depicts the exact location and kind of section of an object. Thick MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 4 6) Free Sketch Line - This line is medium thick and bold. This line is drawn to represent an edge having relatively smaller length where the object is broken in the diagram. Thick 7) Break Line - This is thin and faint. If the edge or side of an object in the diagram is relat ively long, then such an edge or side is depicted in the form of long broken lines joined by freehand slanted lines. Thin 8) Contour Line - This is thin and bold. They also use this line to show the adjacent areas, electricity poles, telephone lines, seawater waves/levels, Topology of valleys and mountains. Thin 9) Status Line - This line is medium, thick, and bold. This line is formed by a series of sets of two small segments each, separated by marginal space in between. Some parts of the machine move from one place to another and back to the first place. This line is used to depict spare parts of the machine repeatedly but at differe nt desired locations. To display the movement, the spare part is depicted at one end of the drawing while status line is used at the other end of drawing to depict the part 's shape/size. Medium Lettering, Numbering An engineering drawing includes lettering and numbering along with diagrams. Naming of the diagram and drafting of title, subtitles, measurements, instructions, and other necessary notes is known as 'Lettering ' and 'Numbering '. Letters / numbers should be understandable, clear, distinct and of same thickness. The size of the letters should be determined based on the size of the drawing. For different types of writing, choose the height of letters as shown below: 1) For the title and drawing number: 6 mm to 12 mm height 2) For small names or subtitle:: 3 mm to 6 mm height 3) Note, list of materials: 3mm to 5mm height Like height of the numbers and letters, the width is also an important aspect. In order to make the letters look good, their proportion of height and width is generally stipulated to be 7:5, 6:5, 6:4, and 6:3. In the drawing, Single vertical letters are broadly used in the drawings. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 5 Related Knowledge - Introduction It is very essential to know the geometric symbols while studying engineering drawing. The things that cannot be shown in drawing by means of mere measurements can be depicted using geometric symbols. This makes the understanding of drawing easier for engineers or c raftsman. In this topic, we are going to get familiar with such geometric symbols commonly used in the drawing. Types of Geometric Tolerance Symbols - Geometric symbols are mainly divided into five types . 1) Form 2) Profile 3) Orientation 4) Location 5) Run out 1) Form - This type consists of the straightness of an object, surface quality, circular and cylindrical shape. 2) Profile -It is used to depict the outer or inner surface. 3) Orientation -Orientation geometric sign is used to show parallelism, partial angle, and right angles between two parts in contact with each other. 4) Location -Location / position viewer geometric symbols are used to display standardization, symmetry, status, directio n, and congruence of both sides. 5) Runout -While an object is rotating around its own axis, the distance between inner and outer surface from a specific /fixed location is represented by a geometric symbol called 'Runout '.

On completion of this session, students will be able to: \u00b7 Identify different drawing instrument & its uses \u00b7 Draw engineering drawing using proper Line, lettering and system of giving dimensions in drawing. \u00b7 Interpret scale on the drawing MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 8 SESSION 2 : ENGINEERING DRAWING (ORTHOGRAPHIC & ISOMETRIC PROJECTION) Concept of Orthographic Projection -We draw the picture of an object, the way we see an object. So, objects at far distance seem smaller while the nearer objects look bigger. If you look at the lampposts having same height on the road, it is found that the lampposts look relatively smaller and of variable height based on their distance from the view point. The circular opening of a bucket seems elliptical. Therefore, to understand the exact shape and true measurements of the object, the picture is drawn by looking at right angle to the object from one side at a time. This is called 'Orthographic Projection '. As orthogra phic projection method captures the picture of the object by looking from one side at a time, one needs to draw pictures from three sides to get an overall imagination of the object. Normally a top, front, and right or left side view of the object is taken into consideration in this technique. \u00b7 Top / Plan view \u00b7 Front / Elevation view \u00b7 Side view The top view displays the length and width of the object, the front view depicts the length and height and the side view provides width and height of the object. However, it should be noted that only having these three views doesn 't necessarily provide you actual view of the object. For that to happen, the orthographic projection is drawn in a specific method. Additionally, to get an overall knowledge of shape/size of the object, the orthographic projections are drawn by looking from at least two sides at a time. \u00b7 1) Orthographic Projection Methods: The first angle or third angle method is used to draw the orthographic projection. However, the Indian Standards Institute (ISI) has recommended the use of the third angle method. There is no difference in the appearance of the objects in both the methods, except their positions. In both methods, the top view is always drawn as a standalone drawing. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 9 \u00b7 First Angle Method: In this method, the top view is drawn below the horizontal reference line, front view is drawn above top view, and right - Figure 4 - First Angle Method Figure 5 - Third Angle Method MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 10 \u00b7 Third Angle Method: In this method, the top view is drawn above axis, front view is drawn below top view and right -side view is drawn on the right side of the front view. Thus, the view don 't change their positions - (unlike first angle method). The relative po sitions of the views with reference to the XY line is as shown in the figure below: Top view (TV) (Plan) L.H. Side View Front View R.H. Side View Right hand side view Front view (FV) Left hand side view (RHSV) (Elevation) (LHSV) Top view (TV) (Plan) In order to convey the method used to draw design (either first angle or third angle), below mentioned Indian Standards Institute (ISI) approved symbols are drawn in the right bottom side of the drawing paper. 1) First Angle 2) Third Angle Steps to Draw Orthographic Projection: The objects are given in the form of isometric view to draw an orthographic projection. Please follow the steps mentioned below to draw orthographic projection view. 1) First draw a clear, faint horizontal line on the paper and name it as X - Y.(Reference Line) 2) Then, draw a vertical line at a right angle and name it as X1 -Y1. (Vertical Reference Line) 3) Draw a faint and thin line above and below X -Y line, and on both sides of X1 - Y1 line at a same distance (approx. 10 to 15 mm). 4) Find out the length, width and height of the object . 5) First, determine the exact location of the side view in four quadrants that have been created by X -Y and X1 -Y1 lines, and accordingly determine the positions of other views, too. 6) Draw a faint square of the dimension 'Length X Width ' in the top view position, 'Length X Height ' in the front view position and 'Width X Height ' in the side view position. Figure 6 - First Angle & Third Angle MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 11 Draw the front view first. Based on front view, one should draw projections to draw other views (top view & side view) and accordingly measurements should be mentio ned correctly. 7) Based on the holistic study of specified isometric view, complete all views of orthographic projection.

MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 14 Isometric View We will learn following things in this section: \u00b7 To clarify the need of an isometric view \u00b7 To explain what is an isometric view \u00b7 To explain how to draw an isometric view Concept of I sometric View - We have learnt how to draw views by orthographic projection method of engineering drawing. At times, it may happen that even brightest of the craftsman may find it difficult to understand the actual shape/size of object by looking at an ort hographic projection view. In such a scenario, a picture is drawn such that all sides of the object are clearly visible in a single view. This helps to assess actual shape/size of the object quickly. Isometric projection view is one of such methods. Isomet ric projection method is a graphical (pictorial) method. You have to draw an engineering drawing (Isometric & Orthographic Projection) of the project object that you would submitting in the engineering department and you are supposed to attach the drawing to Project Report. Also, you are expected to practice few isometric projection diagrams presented to you. Method to Draw an Isometric Projection Unlike in orthographic projection view, where you see only one side of the object in each view; isometric pro jection view displays more than one side of the object. Hence, an isometric projection view is drawn based on the orthographic projection view. Before you begin to draw an isometric projection view, hold one of the vertices (corners) of the object in front of you so that you can see two sides of the object. Now with this view in front of, you should begin drawing an isometric view. Two or three views would be provided to you to draw an isometric projection. To draw an isometric projection based on those vie ws, follow procedure mentioned below: 1. First, draw a clear and thin horizontal line on the drawing paper. 2. Mark a point at a convenient location on the line. 3. Draw a faint vertical line from the starting point and draw a line making an angle of 30 with the h orizontal line on both sides of it. 4. Deduce the length, width and height of the object based on the given views. Identify which side of the starting point, the length and width fall to. 5. Mark the height on the vertical line. Based on the measurements in the reference views; mark the designated length and width on the lines drawn at 30 angle with horizontal line. 6. From the markings, draw fine lines parallel to reference lines and draw a rectangular block. 7. Complete the isometric projection view by studying the object's visualization and available views. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 15 Illustration of drawing a rectangular isometric projection based on rectangular orthographic projection : Figure 12 - Orthographic Projection & Steps of Drawing Isometric Projection Steps to draw an isometric projection - Draw a circle in Isometric Projection - If a circle is given in the orthographic projection, then following information will help you to understand how to draw it in isometric projection: 1. Based on the location of circle in the specified diagram, determine the quadrant and location of circle is the isometric projection. 2. Accordingly, draw a rhombus having side equal to diameter of the circle at appropriate location. 3. Take the center of the rhombus sides . 4. Place the tip of compass at the obtuse angle of rhombus (Point 1, 4) and draw arcs connecting the centre points of the sides in front of the obtuse angle. 5. Draw faint lines from the obtuse angle connecting it to the centre of sides opposite to it. 6. Place the tip of compass at the inte rsecting point of these faint lines and draw arcs connecting the centre points of the adjacent sides of it. Thus, complete the circle. Figure 13 - Steps of Drawing Isometric Circle MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 16 2.1 Procedure to draw orthographic projection view based on isometric projection view and vice versa An engineer or a craftsman cannot describe a job or provide you with detailed information about the job, in without an engineering drawing. A drawing drafted based on the orthographic projection view can provide you with a fair idea about size and shape of that object and machinery part. Unless you know the techniques of Engineering drawing, it is impossible to describe it. It is expected to have at least two views to understand measurements (length, width, height, distance between focal length of holes, etc.) of a job. It is necessary to know all types of lines viz. Object line, dotted line, centre line etc. in order to describe a drawing. Example 1) To draw an isometric projection of an object based on three views: top, front, and side view Drawing an isometric projection based on description - Example 1) Draw an isometric projection of following dimensions: 70 mm length, 50 mm width and 30 mm height Example 2) Draw an isometric projection of a cube having an edge of 44 mm, with a centrally located cylinder of 30 mm diameter and 50 mm height. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 17 After studying all the available information, one should seek answers to a questionnaire. E.g. Answer the questions below, based on the diagram. Questionnaire - 1) What is the height of the table? 2) What is the thickness of the table top? 3) What is the distance of support 'A' from the ground? 4) How many square meters of plywood is needed to prepare the table top? 5) What are the measurements of timber used to prepare supports (legs) of the table? Orthographic Projection - Answers - 1) Total height of the table is 775 mm. 2) The thickness of the table top is 25 mm. 3) The support 'A' has been installed at a distance of 150 mm from the ground. 4) 0.66 square meter of plywood would be required to make the table top. 5) 50 x 50 mm of timber is used for making the supports (legs) of the table.

Especially while working in a workshop, it is necessary to follow safety rules. If an accident occurs during work, an injury may hamper life temporarily or permanently. There are two main reasons behind an accident during work: unsafe practice, unsafe tools. It means that it is necessary to adapt safe practice and use safe tools to avoid accidents. \u00d8 Safe Practice - To adhere to safety norms, following things must be followed diligently: 1. We must have a comprehensive and thorough knowledge of the tools and equipment that we need. 2. During actual work, the tools and equipment should be handled carefully and safely 3. As far as possible, avoid wearing loose clothes while at work. Clothing like scarf, veil may get trapped in a machine leading to fatal accident. 4. While undertaking work like drilling, cutting, welding, threading, keep your face, especially eyes, away at a safe dista nce from the job. This helps to protect the face and eyes from the granular dusty metal hot particles while at work. 5. Keep the workplace clean and tidy. Keep unnecessary things away, at an appropriate place. 6. Switch off the main switch once the task is accom plished. Keep all the tools and equipment properly at an appropriate place. \u00d8 Safety Gear - Using the right safety gear is essential while at work. 1. Intense heat and radiations generated during welding may harm your eyes. So, always use a goggle or welding g lass. 2. Use hand gloves while drilling. 3. While dealing with any electrical appliance, it is advisable to wear rubber sole boots/slippers. 4. Power tools should be properly insulated (electrically insulated) \"5 S\" in Workshop :( 1.Seiri -Neatness, 2.Seiton - Tidiness, Seiso - Hygiene, 4. Seiketsu - Standardization, 5.

Vernier Caliper -Vernier caliper can be used to measure outer measurements, inner measurements, and depth of the job. It has a facility to measure by metric as well as British measuring technique. Vernier Caliper can measure the job with an accuracy of 0.02 mm in metric system while 0.001 in British system. Vernier Caliper is available in different length ranging from 150 mm to 1000 mm. Vernier Caliper Parts - 1) Fix jaw 2) Beam / Main scale 3) Movable jaw 4) Vernier scale 5) Carrier / ancillary slide 6) Fine adjusting screw/nut 7) Locking adjusting screw/nut 8) Inside Major nibs/Jaw 9) Depth Gauge attachment All parts of Vernier Caliper are generally made up of Nickel Chromium steel. Marking -Vernier Caliper has two types of markings: British and metric markings on both sides of the main scale. One side consists of matrix marking while other has British marking. There are two types of metric marking. Some Vernier scale has 10 equal parts of a centimeter , while some have 20 equal parts of a centimeter . Vernier Caliper having 10 equal parts of a centimeter , there are 50 parts on Vernier scale accommodated in 49 mm on main scale. So, the difference between two parts of the Vernier comes to 49/50 = 0 .98 mm Hence, Least Count = 1 mm - 0.98 mm = 0.02 mm Vernier Caliper having 20 equal parts of a centimeter , there are 25 parts on Vernier scale accommodated in 24 parts of main scale, means 12 mm on main scale or 49 parts of main scale, means 24.5 mm on main scale. Thus, difference between two parts of the Vernier comes to 12/25 = 0.48 mm and 24.5/25 = 0.98 m m, respectively. Hence, Least Count (0.50 mm - 0.48 mm) = 0.02 mm and (1 mm - 0.98 mm) = 0.02 mm Reading -While reading Vernier, keep in mind three things as mentioned below: 1) Check exact location of '0' on Vernier scale 2) Check exact line on the Vernier that is aligned to any line on the main scale 3) Vernier Caliper should be held at a right angle to eyesight MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 26 Precautionary Measures - 1) Clean the job and Vernier Caliper before you begin recording measurements 2) Do not record measurements on a moving or rotating job. 3) Check out the difference between the Vernier Caliper 4) Do not apply pressure on moving during measurement 5) Hold Vernier Caliper straight while recording inner measurements 6) Hold Vernier Caliper at right angle to eyesight while reading Fig 14 - Vernier caliper Fig 15 - Vernier caliper scale Vernier Height Gauge Vernier height gauge is also called as 'Micrometer Vernier Slide Height Gauge '. Vernier height gauge is used to measure an object 's height, vertical distance, and inner& outer diameter of a spherical / cylindrical object. Fig 16 - Vernier Height Gauge MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 27 OUTSIDE MICROMETRE / MICROMETRE SCREW GAUGE - 'Outside Micrometer ' is nothing an instrument to measure very minute distance. Outside Micrometer is known as the most precise mechanical measurement instrument in day -to-day use. Let us see brief information about micrometer 's parts. 1) Steel Frame U - Shape -The frame shape is like English alphabet 'U' or 'C'. The frame is generally made up o f steel, cast steel or alloy steel. Frame is aptly insulated so that it provides good support for holding the micrometer and heat transfer is avoided while recording minute measurements. This results into accurate measurement. Fig 17 - Micrometer scre w gauge 2) Anvil and Spindle - A fixed an vil is fitted normally at a distance of 3 mm on the inner side of left portion of frame. Another moving anvil is placed on the tip of the spindle. Spindle can be locked with the help of lock nut. 3) Lock Nut - Lock nuts is installed to lock the spindle. It is used to lock the spindle while recording accurate measurements by micrometer . 4) Sleeve or Barrel -Sleeve consists of accurate markings of 0.5 mm on it and this is called 'Main Scale'. This sleeve is chrome plated and has a provision of zero (\"()\") setting. 5) Thimble -Thimble keeps moving on the sleeve or barrel back and forth. It is divided into 50 equal parts. Each part measures to 0.01 mm. Division on thimble are similar to Vernier scale. 6) Ratchet -Ratchet is fitted at the end of the thimble. It is used to record accurate measurements by fine adjustment. The least count of outside micrometers is calculated by following method: Pitch of spindle screw L. C. of Micrometer = ---------------------------------------------- Number of divisions on the thimble Suppose, spi ndle's pitch is 0.5mm and the thimble has 50 parts. So, micrometer 's least count = 0.5/50 = 0.01mm Measurement - 12.58mm Measurement - 17.20mm MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 28 CHECK YOUR PROGRESS Subjective Questions 1) What is Vernier Caliper and what is it used for? 2) Describe detailed information about parts of Outside Micrometer . 3) Explain use of Vernier height gauge. 4) How to calculate least count of Vernier Caliper ? 5) Describe information about parts of outside micrometer . 6) How to calculate least count of outside micromete r?

MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 29 SESSION 5: TYPES OF GI PIPE FITTINGS G.I pipe means \"Galvanized Iron\". In G.I pipe, i ron or steel pipe is coated with zinc (Galvanization). This coating process is useful in protecting iron or steel metal from deterioration or rusting. By means of this process, iron metal is protected from corrosion and as a result, th e life and durability of the GI pipe increases. Zinc coated iron pipes are broadly used to carry water. Apart from this, GI pipes are mainly used for plumbing purposes in building construction. GI pipes available in market are available in sizes ranging f rom 8 to 100 mm in diameter. Based on the thickness, these pipes are generally available in three types. 1. Light (Class A) - The identity of this pipe is that it is marked with yellow colour. (Thickness - 2 mm) 2. Medium (Class B) - The identity of this pipe is that it is marked with blue colour. (Thickness - 2.65 mm) 3. Heavy (Class C) - The identity of this pipe is that it is marked with red colour. (Thickness - 3.25 mm) Plumbing - Information about Tapping Process and Types of Tap and Dye - \u00d8 Tap -Many times n uts, bolts, screws need to be used while assembling any machinery. Seamless turning of inner part of nut and outer part of screw or bolt to form grooves is called as threading or tapping and continuous groove thus formed is called as thread. During large-scale production in a factory, the threads are made using machine. However, during job making or repair work in a workshop, the threads are made manually. They are of 'V' size. Taps and dies are used to make thread. Fig 18 - Tap Tap is a cutting tool used to make threads in inner part of a job. Tap is made from high carbon steel (HSS). It undergoes the process of hardening and tempering. Hand tap always comes in a set of three. These three taps are known as first, second (middle) and third (or plug or bottom). Four or five threads p resent at the end of first ta, that leads to an easy grip in the hole. First tap is used as the initial step of threading. Two or three threads present at the end of second tap are narrow. The second tap is used after the use of first tap. In case of the third tap (plug / bottom), only the first thread is narrow, while rest of the threads possess required measurements. This third tap is used to mould right s hape to the thread. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 30 It is always advisable to hold the tap at right angle with the job and rotate it in forward direction for half (50%) to 'quarter to one ' (75%) of a full turn. To cut the chips rotate it in reverse direction for quarter (25%) to half (5 0%) of a full turn. Care and precautionary measures to be taken during tapping 1) Use lubricant during tapping. 2) Tightly hold the tap in tap wrench. 3) Choose right size of the tap and the hole for which you want to perform threading. 4) Ensure that the hole tapping is to be done is straight. 5) Hold the job tightly in the vice. 6) Always hold the tap at right angle to the job. 7) Rotate the tap in forward direction for half (50%) to 'quarter to one ' (75%) of a full turn. To cut the chips rotate it in reverse directio n for quarter (25%) to half (50%) of a full turn. Threading Die (Die Piece &Die Stock) Threading Die is used for threading on the cylindrical part of iron rods. This die is also a cutting tool, and the process of threading by this tool is called as 'Dyeing '. Die looks like a circular disc and is made up of High Speed Steel (HSP), Alloy Steel or Tool Steel. Main types of die are as follows: 1) Solid Die -This die is a round disc having a threaded hole of appropriate size at its centre. Solid dies are av ailable in different shapes and matching to holes of different sizes. Thread type and shape is mentioned on it for easier identification. Based on the application (use) and shape of job, Solid dies are fitted in the diestock at the time of threading. 2) Split Die -A groove is made in the split die. By means of this groove, the die is fitted in the diestock and one can operate the screw as per need to perform threading until full depth. 3) Two Piece Die -This die is divided into two pieces. They are called 'Die B its'. Both pieces have 'V' shaped threads. By fixing the die piece in die stock, threads are made with the help of the screw by doing adjustments. This is used for threading on a big cylinder. 4) Die Nut -Die nuts are square or hexagonal in shape. It is usef ul for convenient threading. Four to six grooves are made in these die nuts to expel the excess material being drilled out during threading. They are fitted in wrench or spanner and used for rethreading the damaged threads. They are also used to clean exis ting threads of a job. 5) Die Plate -This is a rectangular strip made up of High Speed Steel (HSS) and it is cut at the centre along a straight line in different shapes. 6) Die stock - The tool in which die is firmly fixed during threading is called as Die Stock. Die stock is made up of steel. Die stock is divided into two types. a. Solid Die Stock -Solid die stock is designed in one piece and has circular hole in the centre. In this, split/solid die is mounted and threading is accomplished. Screw arrangement is provisioned to hold die. b. Adjustable Die Stock -Adjustable die stock is available in two shapes: Square and Round. Threads are made by fixing die set in it. In this cas e, too, screw arrangement MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 31 is provided to hold the die and to adjust the depth of the thread according to requirement. Care and precautionary measures to be taken while using die / Performing threading operations - Fig 19 - Adjustable Die Stock Fig 20 - Solid Die Stock 1) The surface of the cylinder should be clean and straight during outside threading. 2) Use coolant (cutting oil) while using die. 3) Hold the job tightly in the vise on the table. 4) Rotate the tap in forward direction for half (50%) to 'quarter to one ' (75%) of a full turn. To cut the chips rotate it in reverse direction for quarter (25%) to half (50%) of a full turn. This helps to cut the chips easily. Selection of Activity -Threading and Joining operations of G. I.

In this operation, two or more metal parts are joined together with the application of extreme (high intensity) heat. This joint is strong and permanent in nature. A specific filler material is used to join these metal parts. This joining process is called as 'Welding '. Initially, the metal i s melted by heating with electric arcs or gas and joint is made with the help of an electric / filler rod. Nowadays welding is done using modern technology such as laser welding or electron beam welding. Generally, arc welding and gas welding is commonly u sed in small and medium -scale industry. (Students are expected to observe the practical; Demonstration should be given only by teacher) Arc Welding - Arc welding is a well - known, old, and conventional method. In this welding method, which is based on the principle of heating, heat is generated using electric current to induce welding. This is the most popular and prevailing method; where in metal pieces are joined together with the help of electrodes through heat is generated by forming electric arcs. In this process, electrode acts as heat conductor and filler metal. Fig 2 1 - Are welding Gas Welding -In this method, welding is done using gas. Heating in this process is mainly done by combined proportionate combustion of Oxygen and Acetylene. Mixed welding gas of Argon and Carbon dioxide (Co 2) is used during gas welding. T he machine by which the heat is generated is called 'Gas-gun'. These guns are connected t o the pipes for electric connection and the availability of gas to generate a specified amount of heat. In this method, metal filler is used externally. In gas welding methods, the specific ingredient, which is used to strengthen metal joints, is called as 'Filler Material ' or 'Filler Metal '. Generally, filler materials used are of two types. Fig 2 2 - Gas welding 1) Filler rod 2) filler wire MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 35 Gas Welding Technique - In this method, you may find three types of flames. Since the temperature and properties of these three flames differ, we can use appropriate flame for different metals as per the metal properties. Types of Flame - 1. Carburizing Flame 2. Neutral Flame 3. Oxidizing Flame 1. Carburizing Flame -This flame is used for metals like Aluminium that tend to oxidise quickly. This is because the carbon present in this flame forms a coating layer on the metal and protects it against oxidation. Similarly, this flame is used in cases where the amount of carbon in the metal is needed to be increased or you wish to hard en the metal. The amount of Acetylene gas is more while Oxygen gas is low in this flame. You may attain a temperature of 3100\u00b0C using this flame. 2. Neutral Flame -This flame is used for metals having high melting points such as mild steel, copper and cast iron. This flame generates temperature of 3200\u00b0C. Both the gases are supplied in equal proportion in this flame. 3. Oxidizing Flame -Oxidizing flame is used for welding, brazing and for metal oxides having low melting temperature (melting point). This flame provides the temperature of 3300\u00b0C.In this method, flux is used for all metals except mild steel. The main purpose of using flux is to retain metal properties without any changes due to application of heat. However, flux is not used for mild steel as the n eutral flame itself acts as flux. Uses - 1. All metals and alloys can be properly welded by this method. 2. Brazing and gouging can be done effectively Electric Arc welding technique - Electrodes (Welding Rods) - An arc is induced between the job and the electrode during electric arc welding. Electrode is nothing but a thin metal rod having flux coating. Flux improves welding and prevents any adverse effect of climate on the welding run. The rods that does not contain a chemical coat (flux), is called as 'Bare Electrode ' or 'Core Wire Electrode '. The type of electrode depends on the amount of flux coating or its chemical composition. E.g. If there is substantial coating, it is called as 'Heavy Coating Electrode ' and in case of low flux coating, it is called as 'Light Coated Electrode '. Function of Flux - 1. Avoids any adverse effects on the welding due to external (Atmospheric) factors and forms the gas shield surrounding the arc. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 36 2. Maintains the welding arc. 3. Helps to purify the metal and prevents it from burnin g 4. Protects against spatter (i.e. droplets of molten material generated during welding) 5. Acts as a coat on welding metal & thus helps to cool down the job gradually and the job does not deteriorate 6. Increases the speed of welding and melts the metal more Electrode Selection - Generally, the rod (electrode) has following characteristics: Characteristics - 1. Ability to maintain uniform Arc / flame 2. To keep the welding run smooth and uniform 3. Accelerate the welding speed 4. Minimize the spatter 5. Enhance welding strength 6. Remove the slag easily (Slag means solid remains of flux - after weld area cools off) To induce above characteristics in welding, consider things mentioned below while selecting electrode (rod): 1. The properties of metal on which welding is to be done 2. Diame ter of rod 3. Type of the joint 4. Welding position 5. Current and polarity of welding 6. Load speed (proportion) 7. Time required to complete the job Welding Joint Inspection - The operator or welder completes the welding joint. However, he should be convinced that it is perfect post job completion. Because if the job is to be used at the place where there could be a lot of load on it or if the strength is required and if the job or its any part is not ready for the same, then it could be very harmful. This would defin itely lead to loss of property, but at times, it may lead to loss to life, too. E.g. Construction of a bridge. To avoid this, any job or part is tested and inspected. There are several methods of inspection for welding jobs. Some of them are as given belo w - 1) Paraffin Test - Using this test, we can see the cracks on bead. Paraffin oil is painted with a brush on bead surface and it is allowed to dry. Post drying, slack lime is spread on the surface. Cracks are clearly visible once the lime dries. 2) Visual Test - During this type of inspection, the bead size is assessed by gauge. We can assess the defects on bead by naked eyes. Therefore, we can identify defects like overlap, undercut, spatter; etc. In addition, you can locate MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 37 the cracks, if any. An intelli gent inspector can narrate the salient features and defects of a joint using this method. 3) Magnetic Test (Magnetic Particle Inspection) - By using this test, defects such as cracks, slag -inclusion, blowhole; etc. can be identified in the welded metal. In th is non -destructive method, iron powder is spread over the metal surface. Later on, a magnetic flux (current) is passed through the welded ferromagnetic metal through two powerful magnets. The defective location tends to generate a magnetic pole inducing a tendency to attract iron powder and yields a collection of iron powder covering the defective area leading to detection of defect. 4) X - Ray Test - This is also a non -destructive method to identify defects present inside welded metal. Defects like cracks, in complete penetration, slag - inclusion, weld cavity; etc. can be identified by this method. X -Ray is passed through the metal. X - Ray image is generated by exposing the metal to photographic plates. The density at the defective location tends to be less an d that leads to darker representation in the X - Ray image. Thus, the defect can be easily identified. This test is used to test important jobs. 5) Stethoscope Test - This non -destructive method uses stethoscope. A job under inspection is hammered using a hamm er and the sound generated during hammering is assessed using stethoscope to check whether there are any defects. Non -defective area sounds like a bell while sound generated at defective location is different. To use this method effectively, one should hav e thorough knowledge of distinguishing variation in sound. A skilled inspector can detect defects within a joint by means of sound. 6) Ammonia per sulphate Test: If we mix one part Ammonium Chloride and nine parts water and rub the mixture on welded metal usi ng a piece of cloth at room temperature, defects in the weld can be easily detected.

Desired Skill - a) Cutting of raw materials (Angle, Plates or Rod) b) Straighten angle or rod c) Run welding d) Tack welding e) Ability to work using safety tools in line with adherence to safety guidelines Welding Safety Measures - In order to be safe, as welder needs to safeguard himself/herself from elements mentioned below: Welding Radiation -Welding emits intense lights, infrared and ultraviolet rays. Hence, a welder should use helmet or hand screen to avoid any adverse effect of radiations on eyes. It also protects eyes from hot, tiny slag particles and sparks and prevents affecting face. Burns - Due to high temperature involved in welding activity, job s tend to become hot and that may lead to burns & wounds. To avoid this, following precautionary measures should be taken: 1. User leather gloves during cutting and welding 2. Use appropriate hand tools. Avoid direct physical contact of any organ with the job. 3. Use good quality shoes. 4. Use goggles for protecting eyes during slag chipping Electricity Supply - Always ensure that welding wires are not open or loose. Welding site should not be wet. Rod holders and cables should be in good condition. In case you get an electric shock, follow these instructions: 1. Move the object (that led to electric shock) away fro m body/welding site 2. Call a doctor or send the injured person to doctor 3. Give mouth to mouth resuscitation (CPR - Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation) 4. Lay the shock affected person horizontally on ground 5. Do not crowd the site. Ensure to supply fresh air Fumes - In case of few metals, welding generates poisonous fumes and gases. It may be hazardous to the worker. So, during welding related to metals like zinc, brass, bronze; etc.; ensure two main things: 1. Welding site should be completely ventilated. 2. Use mask during welding. Explosion and Fire - In these cases, ensure following precautions: 1. Do not store inflammable and explosive material near welding site 2. Keep well -maintained fire extinguishers nearby welding site 3. Switch off all electric buttons post completi on of welding 4. After post welding job completion; ensure that none of the objects is hot. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 39 Safety Rules and Regulations - 1.

In ancient times, creativity and skill used to be expressed through civil construction. At that time stones and bricks were the primary construction material. Over the period, man started t o use timber, iron, and cement in construction. While living in natural habitat, he studied structural details and composition of natural resources and used them in building construction. (Skeleton method and fibrous method). Though fibrous materials are flexible, they have good tensile strength. By adding fibrous material in brittle material, the brittleness can be reduced to a substantial level. Mortar, being brittle, breaks easily. However, adding chicken wire mesh in mortar gives rise to Ferro - cement ha ving better strength. Fig 23 - Ferro -cement What is Ferro -cement? Ferro -cement is a new innovative construction material. In this, a skeleton is created using cement mortar, metal rods and mesh. Following are the ingredients of Ferro -cement - \u00b7 A mixture of cement, sand, mortar, water \u00b7 Metal rods \u00b7 Skeleton of weld mesh and chicken mesh \u00b7 Coating material Benefits of Ferro -cement - 1) Ferro -cement is used as a primary raw material in the basic skeleton of new construction. 2) Any shape/form model can be creat ed using Ferro -cement 3) No need of skilled labour 4) Light weight and long lasting, if necessary care is taken 5) Has earthquake resistant capability Drawbacks of Ferro -cement - 1) If the metal rod skeleton in the Ferro -cement is not coated with mortar properly, then corrosion may happen due to its contact with air. 2) Ferro -cement is difficult to join using screws, welding, or nails. 3) Large number of workers is required while using Ferro -cement. If the workers are not skilled, the duration and expenditure of work increas es. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 43 4) It is more difficult and time consuming to form a skeleton of metal rods and weld mesh -chicken mesh.

Cut the chicken mesh as per mentioned measurement. 4. Then tie the chicken mes h on the given rods of square frame using binding wire. 5. Prepare mortar by mixing sand, cement, and water in a proportionate manner. 6. Spread polythene paper on plain ground and place the chicken mesh bound square frame on it. 7. Apply mortar on frame with the h elp of masonry trowel. 8. Roll and distribute the mortar evenly across frame using rods. 9. Spread and level the mortar with the help of plastering trowel. 10. After approximately two hours, cover it with wet jute bag. 11. Sprinkle water (i.e. curing process) on the pre pared Ferro -cement sheet for a minimum of 7 days to a maximum of 14 days. Precautionary Measures - 1. Cut the chicken mesh slightly larger than the frame. Design the flowchart for Ferro -cement. 2. Tie the chicken mesh firmly to frame so that it does not come out after application of mortar over it. 3. Filter sand being used for mortar and wash it before use. 4. While preparing mortar, first mix sand and cement thoroughly using masonry trowel. Then keep adding water in it gradually. 5. Place the frame slightly above the floor to apply mortar of equal thickness on both sides of the frame. 6. Cut edges of the sides of Ferro -cement sheet neatly so that it gets square shape. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 45 7. Do not sprinkle too much water on mortar on first day. Do you know this? 1. Based on shape, masonry trowe l has different types. E.g. Square, Heart; etc. 2. Plastering trowel is made up of either wood or iron. According to the nature of work, plastering trowel of various lengths is used. 3. The mixture of cement and sand is called as mortar. While preparing the Ferr o- cement items such as sheet, tank etc. mixing ratio is 1:3 or 1:4 and for finishing it remains as 1:1. 4. While preparing mortar, half liter of water is used per 1 Kg cement. This is called as 'Water Cement Ratio '. The strength of mortar depends on this rati o. Due to excess water, minute granules of cement are washed away. 5. Mixing of water to cement leads to a chemical reaction resulting into hardening of cement. However, it takes 20 to 21 days to acquire full strength to cement. Therefore, cement should be ke pt wet for first 28 days by sprinkling water after regular intervals. This process is called as 'Curing '. The duration of curing varies depending on job width, job type, geographical condition, etc. 6. If there is no soil present in sand, if Roding is done ap propriately and if covering is done properly, cracks no crack formation occurs in job. 7. In Ferro -cement technique, iron is used along with cement. Due to iron, tensile strength of the Ferro -cement increases along with pressure (load carrying capacity). Unli ke R.C.C. technique that used more amount of iron, Ferro - cement uses only iron frame and chicken mesh. This effectively reduces width of the sheet. Hence, it is very light in weight and inexpensive, too. 8. If you wish to create exact replica in the die of or iginal item (e.g. Washbasin, Cement sheet etc.); then only cement is used instead of mortar. Water and cement are mixed in equal quantity. In this jute cloth is used as binder (to support the cement). Activity 2: Practical - Constructing a Water Tank (Cement) - Water Storage Capacity - 250 Litres Benefits & Use - 1.

Cement concrete possesses good compressive strength; however, its tensile stren gth. Therefore, iron are placed along with concrete wherever tension is anticipated. It is called as R.C.C (Reinforced Cement Concrete). Due to higher amount of strength in R.C.C. columns, they are durable and construction becomes long lasting. It is econo mical and it is easy to construct. It is useful for heavy load bearing structures. In this lesson, we are going to learn the skill to build R.C.C columns that are very useful in building construction. Fig 26 - R.C.C. Column Construction - Making of R.C.C. Column Preparation - Selection of Activity - 1. Construct R.C.C. Columns of 3m height for a compound. 2. Do concrete work for school. (E.g. Foundation, constructing steps). 3.

Cut the torsion bar into 4 pieces using chisel as per given measurement. 2. Cut the round bar using chisel as per given measurement. 3. Bend the round bar at right angles and prepare a square / rectangular frame. 4. Bind these square frames to the torsion bar using binding wire at the distance of 19 to 20cm from each other. 5. Join four wooden planks with each other at right angles vertically to form a frame/mould. Around the column frame. 6. Prepare concrete by mixing gravel, sieved sand, cement, and water on an iron sheet. 7. Erect the wooden frame/mould vertically on a flat surface of concrete base and put some concrete at its bottom. 8. Insert a mould (frame) of bars at the cent re of wooden frame/mould. 9. Keep pouring concrete gradually into the wooden frame/mould until the column is full of concrete. 10. Next day, remove the wooden planks. 11. Wrap the column with jute bags and sprinkle water on it till 28 days. Precautionary Measures - 1. Maintain the height of torsion bar pieces 10 to 15 cm more than the column height. 2. While preparing square frame, keep the torsion bar joint at centre along length. 3. Ensure that two bars should overlap for 2 to 3 cm on each other near joint of two bars. 4. Keep torsion bar inside square frame. 5. While building the structure; ensure that the frame joints remain on different sides. 6. Keep the wooden planks ' frame/mould2 to 4 cm larger than the steel frame structure for covering purpose. 7. Check whether all corners of fr ame/mould are at right angle to each other, using plumb bob. 8. Use only three wooden planks in case the mould needs to be placed horizontally. 9. While preparing concrete, first mix gravel, sand, and cement thoroughly with the help of a shovel. Once they are mi xed cohesively, add water to the mixture. 10. Initially fix the structure in concrete firmly. 11. While pouring the concrete, keep levelling it with screed bar intermittently. This will ensure uniform spread of concrete settles across entire structure. 12. Take utmost precaution to ensure that wooden planks and column corners are not disturbed. This may lead to distortion of frame structure. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 50 Do you know this? 1. Due to plumb bob 's weight, its string remains at right angle with the ground level. 2. The mixture of cement, sand and gravel is called as concrete. Concrete is used to lay foundation of machines, R.C.C. columns. For the machine foundation, the ratio 1:4:8 of this mixture is used and for the R.C.C. columns, the ratio remains 2:3:6. 3. Iron is used in R.C.C (Reinforce d Cement Concrete). When iron is not used in concrete, it is called as P.C.C., meaning 'Plain Cement Concrete '. 4. Torsion bars which are spiral in structure are used in R.C.C. structure. It provides better grip for cement on iron bars. Round bars are elastic and hence they are used to form square frames. 5. Torsion bars of 8mm, 10mm, 12mm and 16mm thickness and round bars of 6mm thickness are used for R.C.C. structure. 6. The vertical structure of R.C.C. is called as a 'Column '. The structure of column is made to b ear the load. Horizontal structure is called as a 'Beam '. The structure of beam is made to bear stress. 7. If one column is to be erected above another column, then to engage bars of first column into second column, keep them outside the width of bars. 8. The la bour charges for R.C.C. structure are calculated as per running feet. Cement is prepared from the reaction of following elements: Calcium, Aluminium, Magnesium and Silicon, with Oxygen and Hydrogen. Out of these, oxides of Calcium, Magnesium, Aluminium an d Silicon are abundantly available in nature. The combination of these mixtures is deeply heated in kiln. During the heating process, water present in the mixture evaporates and it attains melted state and thus, forms a composition. After sufficient coolin g process, it is converted to fine powder form. It is called as 'Portland Cement '. When it is mixed with water, its different molecules form bonds with the water molecules. Due to this chemical bond, cement attains strength. However, cement is always used to join different items with each other. Mixing of cement with sand and gravel leads to formation of concrete. Though the cement portion in this mixture is relatively low, due to its bonding ability, entire concrete hardens like a rock. If already hardened cement is mixed with water, it doesn 't provide any strength. So, always ensure that cement is not exposed to the moisture in air that may lead to its hardening. Therefore, before actual use, cement should be stored in the dry area above ground (away from wet surface). Mortar and Concrete Mixture of different stone particles, sand and gravel is bonded together with the help of cement. The cavity between stone particles is filled with cement. To reduce the cost of cement, different sized particles (sand, gravel) are combined. Mortar is mixtu re of cement and sand . 'Concrete ' is mixture of cement, sand and gravel . As concrete consists of bonded pieces of stone, it becomes very strong. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 51 Fig 27 - Mortar Fig 28 - Concrete Characteristics 1. Post chemical reaction, cement becomes hard and it remains as is in water. 2. Cement does not deteriorate or rust in normal climate condition. The structural part that is supposed to have tensile strength or sustain load, iron structures are used along with concrete as a support. 3. Cement c oncrete is neither affected by normal heat nor gets burnt. However, it may burst due to major fire. 4. Cement is bad conductor of electricity and heat. 5. If water content in the cement mortar is high, then after curing cavities are formed leading to weakening of cement.

Final finishing is provided to a construction with the help of processes like plastering, painting, varnishing; etc. The main objective of final finishing is to protect the bui lding or surface of an object from changing climatic factors of atmosphere like rain, humidity, and temperature. Processes like plastering, painting are beneficial to enhance durability of construction. In this chapter, we are going to learn the various pr ocesses being used to provide final finishing to a building post completion of construction. PLASTER: - Plastering is essential during construction of a building or a house to achieve uniformity and neatness for all walls from interior and exterior sides. Let us understand what is meant by 'Plaster ' first. Plaster means a soft and pasty coat of a mixture of sand , water , cement, and other ingredients (that provide strength to construction) being given to internal and/or external surface of walls and c eiling. Fig 32 - Plaster Walls and ceiling need to be given two coats of plaster. The base coat (initial coat) may vary from 9 to 15 mm while the top coat (final coat) consists of 2 to 5 mm thick ness. The ratio of sand to cement is kept as 1:3 to 1:6 and 1:4 to 1:6 in both coats, respectively. Base coat of plaster consists of thick and solid layer of mixture. After completion of base coat, the cement applied on wall surface is spread using a flat wooden plank, also known as 'Wooden Float '. The top coat is applied before the base coat dries completely. This helps to form a firm and cohesive bond between both coats (base coat & top coat). Following are the types of plaster ; viz. Cement Plaster, Eart hen Plaster (a mixture of clay and cow dung), specialized waterproof plaster, specially designed stucco plaster (primarily used for exterior walls). Generally, we use cement plaster. However, in rural area, in some cases, the traditional earthen plaster ma de up of a mixture of clay and cow dung is still used. Similarly, in urban area, Plaster of Paris is used abundantly. Benefits of Plastering - 1. There are multiple benefits of plastering. It eliminates roughness and unevenness of wall and ceiling making th em uniform. 2. Plastering helps to cover up the sub -standard material used during construction. 3. It helps to protect the building from external detrimental sources like rain, dust; 4. Any shortcomings or minor faults induced during construction can be covered up by plastering. 5. The gaps and roughness between brickwork can be corrected by plastering. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 58 6. Plastering provides final finishing to construction wherein a uniform surface is created to enhance a building 's look as per need and in desired proportion. This helps to paint the walls, draw paintings, or hang posters effectively enriching the overall lo ok of the walls. 7. Plaster is strong and durable by nature. It doesn 't contract or expand with changing climatic conditions. Plaster sustains firm grip of walls. Precautionary measures to be taken while selecting plastering material - 1. Plaster should always be soft, non -absorbent, fire resistant, washable, immune to change in climatic temperature 2. It should not contract post drying and application on wall 3. Plaster should hold a firm and uniform grip on the wall Following things should be considered while sele cting plastering material in relation to factors that may affect plastering material - 1. Availability and d durability of binding material to be used with plaster 2. Roughness and expected uniformity of the surface where plaster is supposed to be applied 3. Current climatic condition at the application area of plaster according to the changing atmospheric situation 4. Surface of wall/ceiling (interior or exterior) Types of Plastering - 1. Earthen Plaster - This is the cheapest option of plastering. Primarily, mud (wet clay) or cow dung is used to plaster walls of homes. In this method of plastering, clay, cow dung, grass and marginal amount of sand is mixed and used for wall plastering. Before plastering, t hese walls are watered and made wet so that the plastering coat is applied smoothly and induce firm grip of plaster on the wall. Fig 33 - Earthen Plaster 2. Cement Plaster - Cement is the primary material for exterior wall plastering. Cement is pre dominantly used to plaster dug land, uniform levelling of walls. 3. Lime Plaster -Lime plaster is produced by mixing lime and sand in 1:1 ratio and crushing it fine in mortar mill to form a uniform material of plaster. Fig 34 - Lime Plaster MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 59 4. POP - Plaster of Paris is a type of plaster derived from quick setting Gypsum (i.e. calcium sulphate hemihydrate). On heating Gypsum, water evaporates and the residual material is known as 'Plaster of Paris or POP'. POP is highly water -soluble and its m ixture with water is used to plaster walls conveniently. As mentioned, POP is water -soluble and hence is not recommended to be used for plastering of exterior walls. A mixture of POP and lime is used to prepare decorative/artistic objects, false ceiling, a nd as a filler for wall cracks and holes. Fig 35 - Plaster of Paris Precautionary measures to be taken during plastering - Before we begin plastering, it is necessary to clean the application area (walls and/or ceiling). \u00b7 The wall (or ceiling) that needs to be plastered should be cleaned first and kept moist appropriately. \u00b7 Ensure that the application area is free from grease, oil, or dust. \u00b7 During plastering, 2 to 3 layers are applied on the wall after a stipulated time interval. Ensure that thickness of ea ch layer is not more than 12 mm. \u00b7 Before beginning plastering, fill up all the holes that were done during construction of wall. \u00b7 After applying plaster on wall, check whether it is spread as a uniform layer, using a plumb bob. \u00b7 After applying plaster on wall, extract excess water by absorbing it with a sponge. \u00b7 Inspect the plaster mixture thoroughly. Remove large stones, wire, threads, or foreign material, if any. \u00b7 Leave the plastered surface as is for at least 12 hours so that the plaster is set firmly. \u00b7 Before commencing painting or finishing process, leave the plastered wall as is, to dry for at least 24 hours. \u00b7 Check whether dried scales or flakes of plastering material do not come out from the surface (i.e. desquamation). \u00b7 Due to uneven proportion of plast ering material, many times hairline cracks appear on the walls. To avoid this, ensure that all ingredients in the plastering mixture are taken in proper proportion. \u00b7 To avoid cracks on the surface of plastered wall, ensure that the plastered wall doesn 't dry immediately after plastering. \u00b7 Ensure that white dots don 't form on the plastered surface due to mineral contents of plastering material. Painting means applying coat of a paint on the wall or ceiling. In the process of painting, a liquid paint material i s applied as a final finishing material on a plastered wall. Post completion of plaster, painting needs to be done for walls, MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 60 ceiling of the building, and wooden furniture, metal items in the house. Applying a coat of paint to items mentioned above is know n as 'Painting '. After completion of construction, painting needs to be done so decorate the building. Painting is needed so that the plastered walls in the house look attractive and beautiful. Necessity of Painting - \u00b7 The main objective of painting is to prevent any adverse effects of changing climatic factors of atmosphere (like rain, humidity, change in temperature, etc.) on the constructed building and its surface. \u00b7 Along with the walls and ceiling, painting needs to be done also for wooden furniture an d metal items in the house. \u00b7 Due to painting, household items and building look attractive. \u00b7 Painting protects wooden furniture and metal items from rusting and termite that may occur due to exposure to climatic factors like humidity and chemical reaction wi th oxygen (called as oxidation). Characteristics of Good Paint - \u00b7 A good paint spreads on the wall uniformly and does not consist of clots, dirt, or foreign material. \u00b7 A good quality paint can be easily handled by a brush \u00b7 A good quality paint is not injurio us to human body. \u00b7 A good quality paint is available at reasonable rate in market. \u00b7 A good paint looks majestic, radiant, and attractive on the wall and lasts long (remains durable). \u00b7 Being fire retardant and antifungal is also characteristics of a good quality paint Following ingredients are present in paint - \u00b7 Base - This is the solid component present in the paint. This is the main ingredient that spreads on the wall surface. The base material defines quality of paint. This ingredient defines paint 's quality of durability and uniform spread on the wall surface. \u00b7 Binder - This is a liquid component present in the paint that is mixed with the base component, helping it to spread unif ormly all over the wall surface . As it helps the wall surface to hold the paint, it is known as 'Binder '. It adds luster to the paint and it protects the wall from water and humidity (i.e. the act of waterproofing). \u00b7 Refined pure linseed oil is used as binder in paint. \u00b7 Paint driers like red lead, lead acetate, cobalt are added t o paint to promote or accelerate the curing or hardening or drying of paint. \u00b7 Coloring Pigments - These are added to paint to give it a specific colour or tone. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 61 Minimum 3 coats are applied during painting. \u00b7 The first coat is known as 'Primer '. This protec ts the wall surface from erosion. \u00b7 The second coat is known as 'Undercoat '. This coat helps to make the wall surface uniform. \u00b7 The third coat is known as 'Finishing Coat '. This coat helps the wall surface to become neat, clean, uniform, majestic, attractive, and radiant. Precautionary measures to be taken during painting - \u00b7 It is necessary to have the application area of painting ventilated. If the room is not adequately ventilated, it may lead to stuffy (bad odour) experience and leave stains of paint on the wall surface. \u00b7 It is necessary to protect the painted wall from water and direct sunlight. A continuous exposure to direct sunlight or water may fade the paint. \u00b7 If the quantity of oil (binder) in the paint is excess or the surface is wet during painting, it may lead to occurrence of bubbles on the painted surface. To avoid this, the wall surface should undergo uniform priming. \u00b7 To avoid any potential damage to flooring during painting, cover the flooring with a scrap carpet. \u00b7 Inspect the target wall for any po tential moistness and/or water leakage before painting. \u00b7 Before beginning painting, scrub the wall surface with a good quality scrubber to remove dried scales or flakes of plastering material. If a hollow sound is heard after tapping the surface, it may be due to substandard quality of plaster. Such plaster is prone to wear off, exposing wall to further deterioration. \u00b7 If cracks are visible on the target wall, they should be smeared over by applying either Plaster of Paris (POP) or a mortar of cement and sand in the ratio of 1:3.

The invention of electricity has been one of the most important inventions in the history and progress of mankind. Electricity pla ys a vital role in our day to day life. Majority of household equipment like tube lights, fridge, machines, electric motor etc. runs on electricity. We are going to learn the basic concept of electricity to understand the working of these electrical equipm ent. What is electric current? What should be the type of electric connection for the flow of electricity? Why does it need an electric wire as a conductor? We will understand all these concepts through the following lesson. Objectives - \u00b7 To know the basic concept of electricity \u00b7 To understand the use of transistor \u00b7 To understand the use of capacitor \u00b7 To understand the concept of electric circuit Let us understand the flow of electric current through following illustrations. \u00b7 Rainwater flows downwards. River f lows down the mountain. \u00b7 Air blows from high pressure area to low pressure area \u00b7 If we put one end of a metal rod into fire, the heat transfers from the fire end towards our hand. \u00b7 So, we can conclude that air, water, heat, all move from higher to lower area s. This rule applies to electricity as well. 1. Electric Current - Every object in nature consists of very small particles called atoms. Protons and neutrons are present in the nucleus of the atom . Electrons are rotating in different levels around the nuc leus. They are attracted weakly towards the center because of central forces. These Electrons are called free Fig 1 - Structure of atom Electrons . Free electrons are present in all metal elements when electric current passes through it. Free electrons are the cathodes. Electricity current passes from the cathode to the anode of battery. The speed of these free electrons creates electricity current. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 64 Cathodes transfer with free electrons. Therefore, passing of electric current in specific time a nd duration is known as electric current. Electrons transfer from cathode to anode. Direction of electric current is from anode to cathode. Concepts of electric technology: Conductor: The objects through which electric current can pass without any obstacles are called conductors. All metals are conductors. E.g.: Iron, Brass Bad conductor: The objects through which electric current cannot pass easily are called bad conductors of electricity. All non -metallic objects are bad conductors. E.g.: Wood, pl astic. Voltage: The element, which is responsible for the transportation of electrons, is called as voltage. Voltage is measured in Volts (V). Voltage is sometimes called the push or force of electricity. Voltmeter is the instrument measure of voltage. Resistance: In an electric circuit, there are some obstacles while passing the current. These obstacles are called resistance. It is measured in '' Ohm unit. While flowing, the electrons hit each other and other ions and this creates some obstacles in th e electric current. This property of a conductor is called RESISTANCE. Ohm is unit of resistance in SI system. Potential differences: Observe the following examples to understand electromotive forces [potential forces]. Have you seen the lightening in the sky? What is the direction of its light? Is it earth to the sky? The answer is NO. The direction of light of the lightening is from sky to land. It is from more electromotive forces to zero electromotive forces (earth)] The unit of these potential differen ces is VOLT. Flow of lightening : From clouds \u00e0 High electromotive forces Towards the earth \u00e0 Zero electromotive forces. Difference in electric level between two points is called as potential difference . The electric current passes when there is d ifference in electric level at the two ends of conductor. Current passes from high electromotive force to low electromotive forces. It continues until it becomes equal at both the ends. When the potential difference between the two ends becomes zero the fl ow of current will stop automatically. +ve \u00e0 -ve There are more electromotive forces at +ve electric charge whereas less electromotive forces at -ve charge. The difference of this level is called as the potential difference. SEMI -CONDUCTOR The objects which conduct electricity only in certain situations or mediums are called semi -conductors. Unlike conductors, Semi -conductors may not conduct electricity in all mediums. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 65 Semi -conductor has electric properties somewhere in the middle, between those of a conductor and a bad conductor. E.g. silicon, germanium, selenium. TRANSISTOR The instrument, which converts the more electric current force into low electric current forc e, is called a Transistor. It plays a vital role as a semi -conductor in many electronic gadgets. Transistor is a small sized semi -conductor. It is used as an amplifier switch in many equipment. It is compact and hence portable. Although it is small, it is highly efficient and also uses less electric power. Due to its small size, it is used in place of electron tubes in modern electric gadgets. For example, the vacuum tubes from the old radios have been replaced by transistors, hence making them smaller in size. Fig 2 - Radio with vacuum tube Fig 3 - Transistor Radio Capacitor stores and regulates the fluctuation in current and transfers it to the electric circuit. Capacitor is used to temporarily store electric energy. There are two electric conductors in a capacitor. These are separated by an insulator. Glass, vacuum air, pape r or plastics may be used as an insulator in the capacitor. Fig 4 - Capacitor In an electric connection or circuit, capacitor is used to block direct current in order to allow flow of alternating current. As per Ohm's law If Potential differences in a conductor is V and the current is I, then their ratio is constant. Ohms law is applicable when the physical condition, area, temperature, objects of medium of the conductor are constant. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 66 V\u00b5 I = Electricity increases when potent ial differences increased. Fig 5 V/I = R where R is the resistance which is constant for a given conductor. Direct Current [DC] - Direct current passes in one direction. Direct current passes from area of high potential to the area of low potential. Direct current flows through closed electric circuit. It is found in low voltage applications. Alternating Current (AC) -Alternating current periodically changes the direction of flow. In our hose we use a lternating current . Fig 6 - Direct & Alternating current If the highest current frequency is 50 Hz then highest voltage is + 311 V AC is more dangerous to human life than DC. Because of this, appliances using DC like batteries, cells, toys etc. do not cause electric shock. However, the household applia nces using AC may be fatal to human life. Series Circuit In a circuit, if the resistors are arranged in such a way that equal current passes through each resistor, such a circuit is called a series circuit. In case of a series circuits, Fig 7 - series circuit 1. Current passes in equal proportion and in every part. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 67 2. sum of all the resistances in the circuit is equal to the resistance of the circuit 3.

The working of these appliances is dependent on electricity. Several times, there is a power cut from the source. What options are available in such cases? How can the electricity be provided in such cases? How does an electric motor work? We shall be learning these Chapters in the following lesson. We will also be learning the working of various electrical appliances and what care should be taken while using them. Objectives 1. To know the structure of inverter and electric pump 2. To pursue the technique of using a n inverter and electric pump 3. To study the working of a DOL starter 4. How to do the maintenance of inverter and electric pump INVERTER: An inverter is an electronic circuit. Its job is to convert the DC voltage from the battery into AC voltage i.e. into a fo rm usable for supplying electricity for household use. Along with the inverter, the circuit includes another small electronic circuit called the battery charger to charge the battery when the battery is not in use. When the main electric supply stops in ou r home, we require another source of electricity to run the electric equipment. In this situation, we may store the electricity in battery and use it according to our necessity. The charged electricity in battery is in DC Voltage and the inverter converts the DC Voltage to AC voltage. Fig 10 - Inverter INVERTER+ BATTERY 'Inverter + Battery + Battery charger' works as a contingency system for situations when the main electric supply stops. But the system does not automatically switch on when the electric supply stops. This needs to be done manually. Hence this is called an offline system. Fig 11 - Inverter + Battery MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 70 For the switch to happen automatically from the main power supply to the inverter +Battery system on an event of power failure, we need to have a \"Mains failure sensing system \" attached to the system. This system continuously assesses the electric supply and switches from the main supply to the inverter system immediately on failure of electric supply. Hence this system of inverte r + battery + battery charger +mains failure sensing system becomes an emergency electric supply substitute. The factors which affect the duration for which this system will continue to supply electricity on failure are: Fig 12 - Working of inverter 1. Number and type of appliances attached (lights, fans, TV) 2. Capacity of battery and type 3. Inverters capacity [400,800,1000,2000 VAE] There is movement of electron in AC and DC wire. Electrons in DC pass in one direction. While in AC it is fluctuating, its speed is 50 to 60 times in one second. This is known as electric frequency. In India, this frequency is 50Hz while in other countries like America it is 60 Hz. AC is used for Homely electric appliances. For computer, mobile DC is used because they need low electromotive power. Fig 13 - Inverter - converting direct current to alternate current How does inverter work? Inverter is a part o f the uninterrupted power supply/source - UPS. As shown in the above diagrams, when the main source of current is on, the power supply is everywhere and the power is stored in battery. As the supply of power is off, the stored power is converted from D C t o A C by inverter. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 71 What exactly happens in an inverter? We see in simple electric circuit, electron move in one direction and the light is on. If we place the battery in opposite direction, the light will be on and the electrons will move in opposite direction. If we change the direction of battery for 50 to 60 times per second, the direction of the electrons will fluctuate. That means DC will be no more, it will be convert into AC. Their frequencies will 50 to 60 Hz. This is the basic mechanical conce pt of inverter. In UPS, this job of changing the direction is done by an electromagnetic key. The Inductor and capacitor of UPS avoid the jerks caused by this process and helps in the free flow of power supply. Fig 15 - Simple circuit Maintenance To en sure that the inverter does not fail in time of need, and provides continuous power supply, we need to take care of it from time to time. This is called the maintenance of the inverter. UPS consists of two parts. 1) Inverter 2) Battery Inverter is an electronic circuit kept inside a sheet metal box. The battery may or may not be kept inside the box. The following steps need to be taken for maintenance of the inverter and battery: 1) INVERTER: Dust hampers proper working of electric equipment. As dust gathers, it may generate moisture and increase the risk of a short circuit. To avoid this, it is necessary to clean the inverter box regularly. A fan is provided in the box for proper ventilation a nd cooling. The fan should be cleaned regularly with cloth. A vacuum cleaner also may be used for cleaning if possible. Connections: All the connections need to be checked regularly. If necessary, the connections should be tightened using a screw driver. 2) Battery Battery is the most important part of the UPS and so its regular maintenance is necessary. If the battery is of zero maintenance or a dry cell battery is being used, there is no need of much maintenance except cleaning of the terminals. Large sca le industrial UPSs use electrolyte filled batteries. These require regular maintenance. Following factors should be kept in mind during maintenance of inverter. 1. Temperature: Check the temperature of battery regularly; it should not be more than the room t emperature. 2. Terminals : A white layer begins to form on the terminals due to oxidation. Due to this the conduction capacity gets reduced. The terminals should be MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 72 cleaned regularly and a layer of petroleum jelly should be applied on the terminals to slow dow n oxidation. 3. Battery: Check the battery for leakage of electrolyte. Keep the battery clean and dry. 4. Vent cap: Vent cap of the battery has small holes. We need to ensure that they should not be blocked by dust. Keep them clean. 5. Level: The minimum and maximu m level of electrolyte is shown on battery. If the level is below the line, fill distilled water into it. 6. Battery voltage : Measure the voltage and record it in Voltmeter regularly ensuring that it is correct. MAINTENANCE RECORD: For maintenance, this recor d book is important. The maintenance record will be date wise. It is very important for repair of defective equipment. SECURITY: Switch of the incoming and outgoing power supply of the inverter before maintenance. After maintenance, the power supply can be switched back on as before. Sample of maintenance table Date: Battery voltage: No. of batteries: Battery no.

Inspection of operation Done/Pending Next maintenance -------------------------- Name and signature of the person doing the maintenance -------------------------- Pump: Pump is used in various places like at home, at construction sites, in buildings to lift the water, in farms etc. to transfer liquid, solid or gaseous substances. Working of the pump is dependent on various sources of energy like electric energy, wind energy, mechanical energy etc. Pumps can be used to pump water out of wells, purification of water bodies, for aeration in car industries, for filling fuel, for filling oil and natural gas and so on. In the medical field, pumps are used in many bio chemical processes. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 73 Parts of pump: Casing: The coating of the pump needs to be such that the pump remains safe from damage due to contents of a tmosphere. The coating of a submersible pump should be water proof and rust proof. Motor: Motor is the main source of power to pump.AC and DC motors are the main source of power for pumps. Impeller : An impaller is a moving rotor in a pump. It helps in increasing the pressure and flow of the liquid in the pump. Shaft: Shaft joins the impeller to the engine. The pump receives power through the shaft. Fig 16 - Piston pump Valve: The valve regulates the flow of the liquid substances in the pump 1) Piston pump: The best example for a piston pump is the hand pump used to pump water from bore wells. These pumps may also work on electricity, diesel engine or using wind or steam pressure. Parts of a piston pump: 1. Cylinder: The cylinder in made of bronze from ins ide so that it stays rust free. The outer material of the cylinder needs to be strong and so is made of iron. 2. Piston: It moves in the pump in an up -down or forward -backward motion. 3. Valve : Valve ensures unidirectional flow inside the pump. In case the flow of liquid is the opposite direction, the valve remains shut tight. Stroke of a piston pump: The distance by which the piston moves in an up -down or upward -downward direction inside the cylinder is called the stroke of the pump. The volume covered by the piston inside the cylider during one stroke is called the displacement of the stroke. r2h= the displacement of one stroke r: radius of cylinder h:distance/height of stroke. Important Features: 1. These pumps work at a less speed. So these are used with eng ines with lesser rpm or as hand pumps. 2. The cylinder is submersed in water and a big rod is brought to the surface and attached to a handle or a motor. By doing this, these pumps can be used to pump watre out of 200 -300 feet deep wells. 3. These pumps do not r equire priming and are suitable for high pressure operation. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 74 4. As this pump has many parts like valve, washer, connecting rod etc it requires higher maintenance to ensure continous working. Centrifugal pump: Main Principle: The circular motion of the fan throws the liquid in outer direction creating a vacuum in the middle portion due to which the outer liquid is pulled inside. The force of the liquid being thrown in the outer direction is used to provide a direction to the flow of liquid. Centrifugal pump works on principle of centrifugal force. An impeller is set in the casing of a centrifugal pump. There is suction pipe inside the pump to suck the water in. To avoid the need of priming the pump every time, a foot valve is set at the end of suction pipe. It holds the inner water inside so that no priming is needed every time the pump is switched on. In case the water is needed to be lifted to a height, a non return valve is fixed at the mouth of the outlet pipe. An electric motor is attached to it for the providing power. The suction pipe is completely filled with water. When the pipe is full, as soon as the power supply to the motor is switched on, the impeller starts rotating and creates a pressure in the water due to which the water starts getting throw n out of outlet pipe at a high speed. Fig 17 - centrifugal Pump the Features: \u00b7 Water is more but pressure is less. \u00b7 Priming: For first use, water needs to be filled. Air is light in weight so it is thrown out by fan. At the moment it does not get the force required to pull the water. \u00b7 These pumps require higher speed to pump the water. So they need to be connected to a diesel engine or a motor before use. \u00b7 No need to fill the water to start the motor because at the end of suction pipe foot valve is fitted. Working of a pump: When we suck water from straw, there is vacuum in straw. The outer pressure of water pushes the water into the straw. As the water is sucked, outer air has to balance the water weight. Water is pushed into vacuum ti ll the water pressure and air pressure are equal. Air pressure is equal to 9.8 meter water pillar. Hence, eventhough there is full vacuum,the water will get lifted upto 9.8 meter by air pressure. After this the level of the water will be same. This means t hat in a vacuum, whether the water will get lifted upto 9.8 meter or not is not dependent on the vacumm itself but on the air pressure outside the vacuum. But if the vacuum created by the pump is not full, then the pump might not be able to lift water even upto a height of 9.8 meter i.e. 33 feet. Generally pumps can lift water upto a height of 25 to 26 feet. The same pump will lift m ore MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 75 water at sea level, lesser on a mountain and even lesser in the Himalays due to lower air pressue. These natural factors affect the suction capacity of the pump at the suction end, however, the discharge end of the pump is not affected by these natural factors. To pump water out of a well, we set the pump at a lower height inside the well. For hands pumps, we submerge the part where the vacuum is generated into the water and so such pumps can pump water out of the deepest of wells. Fig 18 - Hand Pump Working system of a DOL starter: Direct on -line starter [DOL] Some decades ago, farmers used oxen to lift the water from well and to water the crops. To make it easier, the researchers invented the diesel engine and it was very useful. Then electricity was invented and started being used in villages. The electric motor was invented so that electri city could be used by the farmers for farming. The farmers started using the electric motors regularly. But, they realized that the motor was in a state of disrepair very regularly. The biggest problem was the fluctuations in the electricity which caused the motor to get burned. The motor used to start automatically after a change in power supply. The farmers did not want this to happen. This led to the invention of a DOL (Direct Online) starter. This turned out to be so useful that now -a-days, ever y motor comes with a DOL starter fixed to it. DOL Starter: To start three phase induction motors of capacity one to five horsepower DOL starter is used . This starter is directly connected to the motor without lowering the line voltage and so it is called a direct online starter. This starter has an overload relay at the top. This relay is joined to the fixed contacts on the base using four screws and bolts. The contacts on the plunger below the base are called moving contacts because they move as per the movements of the plunger. A laminated core with a no volt coil is fixed at the bottom side of the plunger. A shaded core ring is fixed on a slot near the mouth of the core. A start and stop switch is connected in series with the no volt coil which is conne cted in parallel with a two -phase supply. Fig 19 - DOL starter circuit Advantages of DOL starter. 1. It makes it easy to start and stop the motor. 2. If there is overload current, overload coil gets activated and disconnects the motor from the power supply. 3. The on -off switches can be installed away from the motor MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 76 Application of DOL starter for connecting a three -phase motor: Equipment: Screw driver, all types of spanner, hammer, tester, wire cutter, electricians' knife, pliers, chisel etc. Tools: Three -phase motor, grease, starter, polish paper etc. Preparation: 1.

Skill to rub the contact strips of DOL starter with the help of polish paper. 8. Skill to set the relay. Contact strips: Regular cleaning of carbo n and dust which gather on contact strip with the help of polish paper Overload relay: Bi metal strips are made up of two metals. When bi metal strips are heated, they bend. Each metal expands at a different rate. Three such strips are connected. Each stri p is wrapped with a coil corresponding to each phase of the power supply. When the current from any of the three phase 's increases above a certain limit, the metal gets bent, the strip moves forward and the circuit breaks near the red button and stops the power supply. After some time, when the strip cools down, the strip returns to original position and the motor can be restarted by pressing the green button. Connecting the three -phase motor: Equipment : Spanner of 6 to 30 no., plies, hammer, bearing puller, screwdriver, chisel. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 77 Tools : one dissembled three -phase motor, polish paper, grease etc. Action : Firstly, clean all the parts of the motor. Rub the inner side of the stator using a polish paper. Then clean the bearing between the non -drive cover and the drive cover using kerosene. Clean both bearings with a dry cloth and apply grease to them. Arrange all nut bolts at one place in ascending order of length and start assembling the motor. Firstly, fix the non -drive end cover to the stator and then carefully fix the rotor inside the stator. Fix the drive end cover to the other side of the stator. Then fit the outer cap of the bearing with the help of nuts and bolts. Then fit the key to the shaft in the non -drive end cover and fix the cooling fan on top of it, Then connect the wires coming from the starter to the terminal box on the cast iron frame on the stator. Dissembling the motor: Assemble all necessary instruments and equipment. Make a marking on the side cover of the motor. Remove the cooling fan cover. Remove the bearing cover. Make a marking on the non -drive end cover and body. Dissemble the drive cover. Remove the rotor from the stator. Varnish and dry the stator. Grease the system. Assemble as before. Note: 1. Motor stays safe due to a DOL s tarter. 2. The overload relay of the DOL starter can be set to required level of ampere. 3. DOL starters setting is in three parts: overload relay, contactor, NVC coil. So, it is easy to dissemble. 4. Three phase voltage is 440 Volt. Motor Electric motor is a machi ne that co nverts the electric energy into mechanical energy. The electric motor has the following parts: 1 Stator : the part, which is stationary in the motor, is stator. It is laminated. Stator is made of silicon steel. There are some slits on the stator. W inding is done in those slits. These slits on the stator are called slots. 2 Rotor: Rotor is the moving part of the motor. On starting the power supply, an electro -magnetic field is created in the coil and the rotor starts rotating and this motion created in the rotor can be used by connecting it to a pulley or a pump. 3 Side cover: Every three phases motor has two -side cover: drive end cover and non-drive cover. Bearings are installed at the center of these covers. The side cover protects the coils and supports to rotor. 4 Bearing : Bearing is used to reduce friction during the operation of a motor. 5 Coils: different sizes of c opper wires are used for making motors of different horse power. To avoid short circuit, insulation is done on the coil and varnish MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 78 is painted to avoid the heating of motor. Several coils of specific number of turns each are made and they are put into the slots of the stator. Universal series motor: In these motors, the armature and field winding is connected in series. In case the direction of the motor needs to be changed, the ends of the armature winding are connected in the opposite way. The speed of this motor can be changed by changing the voltage supplied or several taps are taken from the series field winding and joined to the rotary switch. Using the rotary switch, the taps on the field winding can be changed and the number of turns can be change d to change the speed of the motor. Advantages: 1. It works on both AC and DC supply. 2. By regulating the voltage, we may increase or decrease the rpm. 3. Motor will not burn easily after over load. Disadvantages: 1. There might be sparking in the commutator near the brush 2. Load hampers the speed of the motor Induction motor: When a conductor coil gets vibrations in an electromagnetic field, it produces electric current. Instead of providing vibrations to the conductor coil, if the vibrations are given to the magnet keeping the conductor coil stable, even then current is produced. This means that to produce current there should be mutual motion between the magnet and the conductor coil. In case the magnetism in an ele ctromagnetic field is fluctuating, even then there is vibration corresponding to the Fig 20 - Induction motor Conductor coil and even this will induce current. This current is called the induction current. Now, if we pass AC current through the coil of a DC motor, the electro magnetism induced in it varies constantly around 50 times per second. Due to this induction current is generated in the conductor of the rotor. In case the rotor coil in shorted instead of joining it to the commutator, an electro magnetism is induced in the rotor and it starts rotating. This means that if AC current is passed through a field coil, the motor starts rotating. Such motors are called induction motors. In such motors, we need not pass external current through the rotor. That's why it does not require split ring or a commutator. For passing the induction current, an aluminum or a copper rod is used in the rotor to wind a thin coil of insulated wire over the armature. All these conductor rods are shorted using an end ring. Rotors shorted using such a technique are called squirrel cage rotors. They are used in induction motors.

For any work, we need energy. The word energy is derived from Greek word energia . The meaning of it is constant working. Energy means the inner capacity of an object. The unit of energy is Joules in SI method. Moreover, in CGS method it is Erg. Units of energy change as per its usage. Even though there are several sources or fo rms of energy, it is possible to convert energy from one form to another. There are two sources of energy - Renewable sources of energy e.g. Solar energy, wind energy etc. Non- Renewable energy e.g. Coal, petroleum, natural gas etc. We are going to concentrate on solar energy in this unit. Solar Energy: Solar energy can be used in day to day lives by converting the energy received from the sun into other forms of energy. The solar energy received from the sun is used by us for heat, lig ht and daylight energy. On its way from the sun to the earth, this light gets emitted and absorbed in the atmosphere. The energy reaching the earth gets reduced due to this. These rays are in the form of small waves. Every object on the earth reflects ligh t in proportion to the amount of light it absorbs from the sun rays. This happens in form of heat waves due to which the temperature on earth stays regulated. When the heat waves from the earth are absorbed by the earth 's atmosphere, it leads to serious i ssue like global warming. Gases like carbon dioxide retain the heat in the atmosphere and increase the temperature of earth. Study of solar energy is important to understand the issues caused by global warming and weather changes. The central government an nounced the program Jawaharlal Nehru national solar campaign on 19 Nov. 2009 for the development of solar energy. Solar energy is a clean source of energy and should be used to generate electricity. It 's advantageous to use solar energy in everyday life as it does not require any meters or generate any bills. If everyone starts using solar energy in their daily life, gradually there will be a change in the quality of human life. Solar cookers, solar heaters, solar lights should be used in place of conventio nal sources of energy so as to reduce pollution, control global warming and protect our environment. In order to do this, it is important to find a way to make these alternate sources of energy available to laymen in an affordable price through government policies. Importance of solar energy: Electricity and wind energy are expensive sources of energy compare to solar energy for which is much more affordable. Solar energy is available to us for 12 hours a day. We can store this energy and use the same for the rest of the 12 hours at night. The cost associated to do this is not very high. Solar energy is unlimited and readily available and so we should make the most of it in the coming years. We should learn to use appliances which run on solar energy. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 81 Working of solar panels and other appliances running on solar energy: Solar Panel: The appliances working on solar energy require a solar panel. Solar panels are used to trap the solar energy received and convert it into a usable form of energy like electric ity. Solar panels are large, rectangular, flat plate -like objects. These solar panels are made of innumerable small cells called the photovoltaic cells. These solar cells consist of semi -conductors. When sun rays fall on the conductors, current gets create d by electrons and photons. For this several solar cells are connected in a parallel circuit. The current generated is stored in a battery and the power supply to all appliances happens through this battery. Appliances using solar energy: Solar water heat er: It is a solar equipment used for domestic and industrial purposes to heat the water. The most common use of solar energy in the world is to heat the water. As an example, heating 100 liters of water using solar energy saves around 1500 units of curren t every year. Parts of solar water heater: Solar water heater consists of a flat plate solar collector which traps the heat in the sunlight. This system also has a water tank installed at a height to store water and a set of taps and piping for the flow of this water. The solar water heater system generally has a set of copper pipes welded together to a copper sheet. They are painted with a layer of highly heat absorbent material. A strong mirror like sheet of glass is placed behind it and further behind it is a highly non - absorbent material. This whole system is places in a flat box. Some models use vacuum glass pipes instead of copper pipes. Such models do not require separate absorbent and non -absorbent sheets. Fig 2 1 - solar water heater Working of a solar water heater: The solar heater system is generally installed on the roof tops, terraces or in huge grounds. The solar panels face the direction of sunlight and the system is constantly provided with a flow of water. Water get heated with the help of sunlight. Since the storage tank is made of a material which can trap heat, the water in the tank stays hot throughout the night and can be ready for use in the morning. Applications of a solar heater: To heat water: At domestic level, hot water is utilized for cleaning, washing, and bathing. In many industries as well, it is useful for many reasons. Advantage: Saves electricity : MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 82 Solar heater is the best substitute to electric water heater. If an electric heater is replaced by a solar heater for household use, it will save up to 1500 units of electricity for every 100 litres of water heated. Economical in energy production : 1000 water heater of 100 -liter capacity saves 1 Megawatt electricity. Environmental benefit : It prevents CO2 from mixi ng in air. It keeps the environmental balance. A 100 - liter solar water heater prevents 1.5 ton CO2 in a year. Life of solar water heater: It is approximately 15 to 20 years. Expenditure : The smallest water heater capacity is 100 liters for 4 to 5 perso n's family. The cost is around Rs.15000 to Rs, 20000.Moreover, it saves 1500 units electricity per year. Solar street lights: Photovoltaic technology is used in street light. It converts the sun light in to DC current. We may use the light at daytime or use it in nighttime by charging it in battery.

Solar Street light in remote area: It is the best option for such areas. The battery used in this has the capacity to save the energy for 10 to 11 hours. In addition to this, it has an automatic switch, to switch the light on or off. This can be used from evening to morning. The butt on saves the battery from over charging, extra drain and losing the MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 83 power. The life of solar photovoltaic module is 25 to 20 years. There is not much maintenance required for the battery. These batteries stay in a good condition for a long time. Expenditur e: Price depends on the quality of material used in construction of these solar lights. Approximately, it is Rs. 24000. Advantages: 1. Easy to install 2. Freely available in Environment 3. No electricity required 4. Easy to handle. Less maintenance Solar lantern: The simple way to produce light from photovol taic technique is solar lantern . It is also useful in urban areas where there is a problem of load shedding as it is technically very simple to install and use. Working of solar lanterns: Battery, photovoltaic pa nel and lamp: these are the parts of solar lantern. It works in a very simple way. Solar energy converts into electric energy by photovoltaic panel and this energy is stored in a sealed battery. The battery works for 4 to 5 hours after charging it.

Engines: An engine is a machine which converts the chemical energy from fuel into mechanical forms of energy through heat waves. In an engine, initially heat is generated by burning of the fuel which creates a pressure which in turn induces motion. Chemical energy heat pressure motion When fuel is bu rnt in an open furnace and then the heat produced by it is used in engine, such engines are called external combustion engines. For example, Steam engines. In this, the fuel converts the water into steam. The pressure created due to the heat of the steam i s regulated as necessary to induce motion. Unlike this, in diesel and petrol engines, the fuel is burnt inside the engine and such engines are called internal combustion engines. Only liquid or gaseous fuels can be used in such engines. Due to this, such forms of fuel have become popular. For example: Kerosene, Petrol, diesel and LPG. Fig 24 - Steam Engine Types of engine by combustion: 1) External combustion: Fuel is burnt in an open furnace and then the heat produced by it e.g. Steam power railway engine and coal power engine. 2) Internal combustion: Fuel combustion is inside the cylinder and piston and this heat produced is used by the engine. Types of engine by stroke: 1) Two stroke Engine 2) Four stroke Engine MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 86 Stroke means the displacement of the piston inside the cylinder in one direction. Types of engine based on fuel used : 1) Diesel engine 2) Petrol engine. Diesel engine When diesel engine was invented, it was used for railway engines. Gradually it started being used for vehicles and agriculture. In diesel s engines, after burning of diesel, the chemical energy in the diesel is converted into heat which generates pressure and then induces motion. Alfred diesel is the inventor of the Diesel Engine. Parts and functions of engine: 1. Cylinder + piston to increa se the pressure at combustion. 2. Valve: regulate the in and out paths of the gas 3. Pump nozzle : supply fuel to diesel engine. 4. Flywheel: it stores the kinetic energy. 5. Starter lever : Avoids compression at the beginning 6. Inlet valve : it sucks the air inside. 7. Out let valve : it lets out the burned gases. 8. Open and shut the inlet outlet in guide valve by rocker armor. Fig 25 - Disel engine 9. Push rod protection pipe : it protects pipe. 10. Push rod : open and shut at rocker time. Fig 11. Tappet : it gives timely motion t o push rod. 12. Cylinder head : it controls the produced pressure. 13. Copper gasket : it restricts the gas leakage in cylinder. It bridges the gap between cylinder cap and cylinder. 14. Piston ring : it fills the gap between cylinder and piston. 15. Oil ring : it supplies oi l and reduces friction between cylinder and piston. 16. Connecting rod : it connects the piston to the crankshaft. 17. Crankshaft: straight motion of piston comes through connecting rod and it becomes cyclic on crock shaft. 18. Gearbox : it protects the gear assembly The function of diesel engine: Air and fuel is required for the combustion of the fuel. The air is compressed at a ratio of 1:18 due to which its volume decreases and temperature increases. Just before the piston reaches the top dead center (TDC), the diesel is sprayed into the cylinder through a nozzle. Due to the high temperature inside, this fuel burns immediately. It creates small sparks. The volume of the combusted air inside the cylinder is high (around 2 -2.5 times that of cold air). These sparks and bu rning of air inside the cylinder gives motion to the cylinder. The energy is stored in the flywheel. Stroke: MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 87 Displacement in upward direction is one stroke and downward direction is the second stroke. This means that in one rotation of the crank shaft, there are two strokes. Since one power stroke of the engine is achieved in two strokes, this is called a two -stroke engine. If one power stroke of engine is achieved in four strokes, it is called a four -stroke engine. Engine cycle There are some actions which happen cyclically in an engine. A set of these actions is called as a cycle. If two strokes of an engine complete one cycle, it is called a two -stroke engine. If four strokes of an engine complete one cycle, it is called a four -stroke engine. Two-stroke engine is lighter in weight. It gives more power than a four -stroke engine in one cycle, it is used in moped. It gives power to every turn. Fig 2 6 - Engine cycle Increase pressure Fuel and air comes combustion and explosion Motion to piston burned gas comes out Two stroke Effect Piston direction 1stStroke Air and fuel compressed. Air comes in crank ca ge. Piston gets motion by an explosion at stroke end. 2nd stroke Piston moves, burned gases exhale out air and fuel pushed into cylinder from crankshaft. The cycle completes. Four stroke engine Result Piston direction 1st stroke Opens in coming valve, fresh air comes in, piston comes down. 2nd Stroke Piston moves up, air gets compressed in cylinder, at the end of the stroke fuel is injected into cylinder through nozzles. Sparks are created and piston is pushed. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 88 3rd Stroke Piston gets motion. It comes down. 4th Stroke Outlet valve of piston is opened, it throws out the burnt gases & moves up. Stroke Piston valve Inlet valve Outlet nozzle Pump 1 Goes down, sucks air Open By filter Closed Closed 2 Takes air inside. Compresses air Closed Closed Showers fuel at the end of stroke. 3 Because of explosion, piston pushes down. Energy moves to flywheel. Closed Closed Closed 4 Piston comes up. Gas comes out. Closed Open. Piston throws out burnt gases through silencer. Closed Petrol engine: Air is sucked in cylinder in petrol engine. While going through the venture, the air takes petrol along with it. The air and fuel mixture is prepared in the carburetor and moves to the cylinder in case of four stroke engines or to the crank cage in case of two stroke engines. Then it is compressed inside the cylinder. Then when a spark of fuel is injected to the spark plug into the cylinder, the fuel burns, creates small explosions and flywheel gets motion through the piston. To spark is created using a spa rk plug due to a magnet which rotates along with the flywheel due to which the ignition voltage increases leading to a spark. The breaker point is opened at the time of sparking. Fig 2 7 - Petrol Engine Two stroke engine Four stroke engine 1. One power stroke in one turn of crankshaft. 1.

Cutting the tree for fuel is not the final solution. It hampers our environment. As the number of people in the family increase, more fuel is required. Many times, rural people purchase wood and kerosene for the fuel. To avoid the depletion of environmental resources, biogas is a good substitute to fuel in rural area. It is made from animal dung, food waste, vegetables etc. Moreover, the urine a nd dung of pet animals and birds and the connection of toilet is given to biogas plant. It provides us fertilizers, gas and at the same time it prevents infections by reducing the waste around us and keeps the environment healthy. It is a boon to the farme rs as they get compost from it. The other option is to produce coal at home by using bio waste disposal. It is easy to make it. The bio waste material is used for this. Raw material is also readily available in the field. The waste from the field is in ton s, that will be utilize in proper disposal way. In this Chapter, we are going to study the concept of bio gas, its types and procedure for manufacturing of coal from bio mass. Biogas: Material require for biogas: \u00b7 Cow dung \u00b7 Waste oil cakes [ground nut oil c ake.] \u00b7 Waste food and vegetables. \u00b7 Rotten fruits and foods. \u00b7 Sewage water. \u00b7 As compare to animal dung, the sewage water does not have much organic factors. Therefore, the gas is also in less proportion. Gas fuel from animal, cow dung is biogas . Biogas is prod uced when the organic factors in animal dung are bio degraded by some bacteria and other microorganisms. In Biogas, the proportion of methane to carbon dioxide is 65:35. Methane is an inflammable gas. The proportion of dung and water put into the machine i s 1:1. The temperature for required to create biogas is around 20oC to 40oC. If we do not dispose the domestic waste carefully, it hampers our health. Hence, the biogas production is necessary. We get slurry and usable gas from biogas. Biogas production helps in disposing of the waste created by humans. Proper waste management ensures prevention of contagious diseases. Therefore, it avoids water and air pollution and keeps the environment healthy. Types of biogas plant The process of gas production in b iogas: A biogas plant is used to store the oxygen -less gas produced by the bio degradation of the organic waste. Methane and carbon dioxide are produced in this plant. Methane is an inflammable gas. The producer gas made in the MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 92 biomass gasifier can be used to pump water, create electricity and for cooking. Biomass gasifiers are available in various capacities as required. Biogas has 55 - 70% methane, 30 -40% nitrogen and traces of hydrogen sulphide. The biodegradation starts by the bacteria and other micro -organisms and they create more types of organisms and produce methane and carbon dioxide gad. The heat value of methane is 4700Kcal and it is highly inflammable. Types of biogas plant: Biogas plant has the set up to store the gas created from the biodegradat ion of natural waste. There are two kinds of set ups. 1) Fixed dome type - Public plant 2) Floating dome type - KVIC, Khadi gram udyog 1) Fixed dome type: The main chamber is dome shaped and is made of concrete or brick. Dung, water and human waste goes to the main chamber through pipes of the filter tanker. There is an outlet path for slurry at one end of the plant. As the pressure inside the main chamber increases with the increase in gas, slurry falls out from a greater height. Fig 28 - Fixed dome type 2) Floating dome type: This structure is easier to construct. Due to this they are more popular and widely used. In the floating dome structure, the main chamber doing the bio degradation of the waste is installed below the ground level. An iron tank which can move downwards is placed on it. These two parts are a part of the floating tank plant. Other important parts: Inlet pipe, outlet pipe and pot. The iron tank is floating in the biodegradation chamber. As the Fig 29 - Floating dome type biogas in the tank increases, it sta rts moving upwards and starts floating. When the gas is let out of the outlet tap, the tank starts moving down as the tank empties. A support structure is provided so that the tank does not topple. This support structure is called a guide frame or a guide pipe. Size: Construct the degradation tank 40 -50 times to the water and sewage will come to septic tank and biogas plant. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 93 For example, if sewage water is 30 liter then the size of the tank should be around 30*50=1500 liter. This will be the volume of ta nk. If 100 -liter dung water mixture is poured, the volume of tank will be 100*50= 5000 liter. In rural areas, the sewage water is 5 liters per person and 20 -liter cow dung mixture for per animal [10 -liter dung +10 -literwater] is consumed. In the fixed dome plant, as the gas collects in tank, the pressure increases as the size of the tank cannot increase. Advantages and usage of biogas: \u00b7 The cow dung is more useful for gas and produces more fuel than dung cake. Its inflammability is more and it is very simple and easy to use. \u00b7 We get compost from slur ry. \u00b7 The gas fuel is without smoke. It is safer to the eyes and environment than burning wood \u00b7 The energy from biogas may be used for fuel, electric lamp etc. Uses of biogas energy: Biogas Fuel is used for cooking, for engine and for lamp. o Note: 1. 1.3 cube feet gas is produced from 1 kg cow dung. 2. Construct the tank 40 to 50 times of dung mixture. If you have 30 -liter dung mixture, the tank will be of 30*50 =1500 liters. 3. To avoid rust, apply black coating to the iron tank from inner and outer side. 4. Rotate the tank every day so that the slurry and dung layer will not block it. 5. Clean the gas pipe in a month. 6. Clean the tank two times in a year. 7. There is no smoke from gas. 8. Leave a gap of 2 or 3 inch between construction and tank. Fixed Dome Floating Dome 1. Gas storage is in underground dome Gas storage is in iron tank on ground 2. If the gas storage is more, the pressure is more. If gas storage is less the pressure is less. Gas pressure is maintained at the same level. 3. The plant is underground. It is not easy to handle and maintain. The plant is on the ground. It is simple and easy to handle and maintain. 4. We cannot increase the capa city of tank We can increase the capacity of mixing [delusion] pot and gas storing tank. 5. Construction cost is more. Construction cost is less. 6. All the parts of plant are underground therefore, cold weather cannot affect. The plant is on the ground. Therefore, the cold weather hampers the gas production. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 94 9. Use the black oil to protect the r usting of tank by moving the tank up and down by dung mixture. 10. The proportion of cow dung and water is 1:1 and the ratio of methane to carbon dioxide is 65:35. Total mass of living matter is called as biomass. Waste from plant & animal origin can be used as biomass. The husk after harvesting, dry leaves, dry vegetables, shells of nuts, crushed sugarcane, rice husk, domestic bio wastage these all are the elements of biomass. Sources of biomass: all the above elements are easily available to us. They can be use as bio fuel. The coal that is made up from bio elements is called bio coal [lonari coal]. Coal is easily available in rural area but the coal made up from biogas is very useful. This coal is environment free. We can produce it at domestic level. It c an be a source of income. It is less expensive. It does not require any skill. It can be produce at large scale. Procedure of making biomass: Procedure one: The research done by the Appropriate Rural technology institute of Pune gives the procedure to produce one batch of coal in 15 -20 minutes by using a normal furnace. Bio waste from the farms or home is put into the furnace, set on fire and covered with a lid with a chimney. After a certain amount of time, the lid and chimney is removed. On removing t he lid, the material may set on fire due to sudden availability of oxygen. The capacity of the furnace is around 6 -7 kg of crushed sugar cane, 5 kg of cardboard, 10 -12 kg of dry grass at a time. The coal produced is around 1/3rd of the total bio waste. All waste material from the farm can be used in this plant. The earned coal is in the form of powder or dry bushes. It cannot be used as fuel directly. To make blocks, add 1 kg starch paste in 10 kg coal and put it in block making machine. For large -scale p roduction, bracketing machines which run on diesel and petrol engines are available. Procedure 2: by keeping organic elements in a big air -tight box and heating it by external heat. It is pollution free and smoke free. The best quality of biomass coal we get from this procedure. Required material: \u00b7 Waste of coconut [crests], dry leaf, dry bushes, crushed sugarcane, nutshells, husk etc. \u00b7 Carbonizing chamber. \u00b7 Starch powder. \u00b7 Block making machine [ small size - 10 kg per hour ] Chronological steps of making coal: Collect the biomaterial: Separate them by grade, dry all the material in sunshine. Make small pieces of large material. Structuring the kiln [furnace/ oven]: Outer drum : take a metal drum of 200 -liter capacity, cut the upper lid. Make a hole of 12in ch width and 10inch height at the bottom. At the bottom of the drum, MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 95 fix two iron rods, 8 inch each, parallel to each other. These are for the support to inner steel drum. Inner drum : it is a steel drum of 100 -liter capacity with lid. There are 6 holes of 3.8-inch diameter at its bottom. This drum is kept in outer big drum. Carbonization of biomaterials : Fill the drum with all the biomaterials. Heat them as per their sizes for 45 minutes to 1 hour by using biomaterial. This procedure is known as firing. Col lect all the material after firing from inner drum. Weight it. We get 30% carbonized coal from this method. Making binder [starch] : it is useful for making the material strong. Take 100 kg. Carbonized coal powder, mix it in 60 to 100liter water and add 5 to 6 kg starch powder as binder. The ratio depends on the raw material. \u00b7 Mixing: Mixing is important to ensure proper binding of the binder to the coal which gets prepared. This ensures even sized bricks. \u00b7 Block making: from the coal mixture, bricks are made by hand or machine. The mixture has to be set into brick shaped molds. It will make the same size bricks. \u00b7 Drying and packing: all the bricks are set to dry in a tray in the sun. These baked bricks are packed in plas tics. General qualities of bricks: Moistness: 7.1% to to 7300 -kilo calorie/kg. Density: 970 Cubic meter. Advantages of this technology: 1. Smokele ss: this coal never makes smoke. 2. Ash less: remains less ash {only 5% of coal weight]. 3. Ratio of Stable carbon level and combustion level: stable carbon level is more. 4. Odorless: the level of vaporizing factors in these bricks is very less. Therefore, these are odorless. 5. Long time lasts burning: these bricks lasts burning for longtime as compare to wood coal. 6. There is less sparking in this coal as compare to wood coal. 7. It is not brittle in structure. It is hard to crack. It burns for long time.

And then we also plan on how to use this stored water. However, if in some year, the rains are late, then all this planning goes for a toss. Then we face with challenges of water scarcity. To avoid this situation, it has become important to save water by using rain water harvesting throughout the year. We cannot continue to rely on traditional ways of storing water. We can increase the ground water level using rain water harvesting. We should stop taking rainfall for granted. Water conservation to increase ground water level: \u00b7 Only 3% water is drinkable on earth, the rest is mostly salty. \u00b7 Out of this 3%, 11% of drinkable water is ground water; we find it up to 800 meters from ground. \u00b7 Ground water is precious and rare. Its quantity is getting less because of irresponsible usage of it. \u00b7 We can raise the ground water level by rainwater harvesting. Types of rain water harvesting: Urban area Rural area Storing of flowing water from the roof. Harvesting pit Well Harvesting tube. Stream bund Percolation tank Gambian weir Nula bund Well harvesting Underground bund Harvesting corrugated. Control cut trenches Rainwater harvesting technique: What is rainwater harvesting: We store the rainwater in rainy season. Purify it and reuse it is rainwater harvesting. Why to save rainwater? The rainwater is clean and drinkable but it is wasted if not collected. These days, there is shortage of drinking water. Therefore, we need to store this clean and pure water. Advantages of saving rainwater: \u00b7 It is an alternate means of water supply to ground water and corporation. \u00b7 The construction and farming would be possible in areas with no water supply \u00b7 High quality of water: clean, pure without chemicals. \u00b7 Zero expenditure on water supply \u00b7 Soil erosion and flood will be less. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 98 The rainwater storage is necessary, when \u00b7 There is low ground water level. \u00b7 Ground water is polluted. \u00b7 The area is rocky and hilly. \u00b7 Flood and earthquake occurs frequently. \u00b7 There are chances of mixing the salty and polluted water in water sources. \u00b7 The population density is low \u00b7 The charges of electricity and water high \u00b7 Water is heavy with minerals. Fig 30 - Rain water Harves ting Usage of rainwater: 1. Cooking, drinking, bathing. 2. Toilet cleaning 3. Washing clothes 4. Irrigation 5. Animal husbandry. Rainwater harvesting Technique: What is rainwater harvesting? The system of rainwater storage: There are three levels of water storage, catchment area, flow and storage. There are two parts of rainwater harvesting. One is store it from the roof of the house and use it for domestic purpose. Other is at field level near a catchment area and is an alternate water supply to the farms. Six elem ents of Water storage system 1. Catchment area: House roof to collect rainwater. 2. Flow: pipes from roof to catchment area 3. Washing roofs: First flush diverter method to filter and omit the polluted particles. 4. Storage: store clean water in the tank. 5. Purificatio n: Filtration should be done using sieve, ozone or using ultra violet rays make it suitable for use at domestic level. 6. Distribution: distribution of water is done by small pump and pressure tank. Rainwater storage in rural area: Build common wells. Next to it on 10/12 foot, make hand pump. Avoid bathing, washing, excretion, washing animals, vehicles, utensils. Maintain cleanliness. Clean the water supply tank after every 3 years. Build horizontal weir on stream and small rivers. It stores the water and perc olates in the ground. This water can be use after rainy season. Apply roof water harvesting system. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 99 Roof water harvesting in rural schools: This system is very economical. Since centuries together, this method has been used in desert regions. In remote v illages where water is rare, two objectives will be achieved if this is done: \u00b7 Drinking water will available in summer \u00b7 Public hygiene level will improve because of keeping lavatory clean by using water. Rainwater Harvesting Project for schools. Construction of rainwater system: Before the construction, collect the data of all schools where there is water shortage. What are the present water resources, area of available roof, type of land etc . Why the water storage tank is below the ground? The water stored in tanks made of lime or available sustainable materials remains fresh and potable till the next rainy season. The tanks installed below the ground level are always more durable than the ones installed above ground level. Very low maintena nce is required for such tanks. Location of the tank: it should be near the schools so that it is easily accessible for the students. \u00b7 The distance of tank from the closest building will have to be at least 3 to 5 feet if the soil is hard rock. \u00b7 If the so il is soft, the distance of tank will be 10 feet. \u00b7 The length of pipe needs to be minimum to avoid the obstacles. The diameter of connecting pipe of tank and storage should be a minimum of 4 inches. \u00b7 If the ground surface is hard then it is not necessary to dig deep. The tank will be 1/3 on ground and 2/3 will be under ground. Material for construction: \u00b7 Local construction material \u00b7 Lime / cement \u00b7 Gypsum \u00b7 Coarse sand \u00b7 Roof making material Size of the tank: Size of the storage tank depends on the type of soil. The traditional size is round or in square. If the soil is hard and rocky, the size is square. The construction technique is easy. Make a square pit and cover it by stones. This can be used as a school 's stage for performances in winter season. Round size tank is in desert region. The rural people of the Thar Desert are very well informed about such techniques of storing water. Local people from such areas build 100 -meter -deep well or tank by using available material. Such excavations prove to be a motivation f or other scientists. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 100 Some facts of ground water resources: \u00b7 Well is not to store the water whereas it is a link to connect the water sources to the surface. The water level changes according to the rainfall every year. \u00b7 After rainy season, the water percolate for long time in well from underground sources. \u00b7 Water from bore well is percolated rainwater from rocky surface area. \u00b7 Every bore well gets dry after some time \u00b7 Use bore well in reverse direction. Make a percolation duct above the dried bore well t o store available water and increase the ground water level. CHECK YOUR PROGRESS Subjective Questions 1. What is rainwater harvesting? 2.

MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 101 SESSION 7: RAINFALL MEASUREMENT METHOD The climate of a certain place changes due to factors like temperature, wind, air pressure, humidity, clouds, rain etc. This short - term change in climate is air. After a long observation and research, the average state of air in a region is finalized, it is called weather. The long state of atmosphere in an average is weather of that region. Meteorologists conclude by observing the changes in temperature, direction of air, humidity in air and rain. Atmo spheric situation, elements of climate is closely related to time and place. There is daily report and map of weather in India. The meteorological department studies the weather. Fig 31 - Rain gauge How the rain falls? When the clouds in the atmosph ere go higher and higher, the dew drops in the clouds turn into water drops because of low temperature. Since they are heavier than air, they can 't float in the air. Therefore, they fall on the earth and we call it as rain. When the water dew becomes big, heavy, and solid, it becomes hail. When the upward air speed becomes less and hail falls on the earth, it is hail fall. When temperature is very low, the dew in the clouds forms into small snow. They float in air. They become heavy and big when they come u nited down towards the earth. This is snowfall. Rainfall measurement: In ancient times, measurements were used for counting the rain. There is an evidence of it. In Koutilya 's economics, there are some entries of rainfall measurements. In 1662, Christopher Ren made measurement of rain. It is called RAIN GAGE/ GAUGE. Other names of Rain gauge are Udometer, Pluviometer and Ombro meter. As per the standardization of measurement, the rain gauge should be generally of 203 ml. [8 -inch diameter]. This m akes measurement of rain easy. Usage of rainwater measurement Keep a bottle in rain. Count the water in it after 24 hours. The size of the bottle should not be excess or less. It should be optimum to measure the rainwater. Unit of rainwater measurement: Rainwater is measured in a rain gauge in mm, cm, and inch. Classification of collected data of rainwater fall: By observing the data, we conclude how the rain was. Sporadic rainfall 0.25 mm rain less than 1 hour Less rainfall 0.25 to 1.00 mm rain in 1 hour Medium rainfall 1 mm to 4 mm rain in 1 hour MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 102 Heavy rainfall 4 mm to 16 mm rain in 1 hour Heavier rainfall 16 to 50 mm rain in one hour. Heaviest rainfall More than 50 mm in more than one hour. The place to keep the rainwater measurement: The measurement bottle should be in open space. It should not be surrounded by walls. Otherwise the rain water will not get stored from that direction. The ground around the measurement need to be flat otherwise the water will store around it and will spla sh into it. The bottle is kept in a cover but it's open. Otherwise, because of vaporization, the measurement count will be less. The cover of bottle should not be in black color. Because, it heats more. The white color will be soiled [dirty]. In India, the trend is to give green color. Its height should be at medium level so that observer can count easily. Animals should not be able to destroy it. It should not be placed on the roof, else it will be hot, and the water stores on the roof and condensation will be formed. Making a rain gauge: Material: Pen, Graph paper, Black marker, Funnel measurement cylinder, Plastic bottle, notebook, and sc issors. Steps to rainwater measurement instrument : 1. Cut the upper side of the bottle. 2. Pour 10ml. water by cylindrical measurement 3. Make a mark on bottle at 10 ml. 4. Again pour 10 ml water and mark at 10 ml. water level 5. The marking will make the scale to the bottle. 6. Make the bottle empty. 7. Keep funnel on bottle 8. This is the rainwater measurement instrument i.e. a rain gauge. Fig 32 - Material required for making rain gauge Marking the rainfall on graph paper: 1. Keep the rain gauge at a proper place. 2. Record the d aily rainfall. 3. Without fail, keep the record of daily rain. 4. Record the rainfall of a month of three seasons. 5. Record the numbers on graph paper. 6.

On completion of this session, are you able to: \u00b7 Make a rain gauge using a plastic bottle and funnel \u00b7 Record the rainfall \u00b7 Analyze other weather parameters measurement from a secondary source (e.g. newspaper, TV) MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 104 SESSION 8: LAND SURVEY METHOD Some years ago, to measure the land the rope or chain were used. Distance was measured by British measurement system e.g. inch, foot, miles etc. Since 1972, we applied metric measurement system. E.g. mm, cm. m, km. etc. In this modern technological develop ment, Dumpy Level system is useful for survey. Below are listed the few basic concepts of this survey method. Map and index lines: map is a picture of a land taken from a height. It adds to the verbal information provided. The language, drawing, reading of the map is standardized all over the world. The mountains, rivers, roads, the sea, lakes, temples, fort, houses, valleys are shown in standard symbols. Therefore, any person can read the map without knowing the script of a language. Definition of map: A figure of specific area seen from the top, in a proportionate scale, presentation, symbols and signs, direction etc. drawn on a plain surface is map. Index is shown in corner of map. Index clears the meaning of signs and symbols, direction and scale. Inde x is important in map reading. Following technical things are to be considered: 1. Proportion: the ratio of distance between two places and the distance between two points on map is in proportion. There is correlation between actual distance on land and the distance between two points on map. Proportion is based on the area of landscape. E.g. if 1 cm is considered for 10,00,000 cm then 100,000 cm is equal to 1 km. hence, 1cm is 10 km. 2. Direction: the direction is shown by the upper side arrow symbol in the ma p. The upper direction is considered for the north direction. By this sign, we can determine the other directions . 3. Signs: different signs and colours are used in a map. These are standardized and each symbol means the same all over the world .E.g. the narrow bridge. 4. A degree of latitude and longitude : to show a fixed place on map, use of imaginary lines as X -axis and Y -axis is done. X - axis presents a degree of latitude and Y - axis as a degree of longitude. X-axis and Y -axis make fix a point on graph, likewise a degree of longitude and a degree of latitude fix the location of a place. Uses of map: 1. To find out the routes in ne w places. 2. To measure the distance between two places. 3. To find out the options of the roads. 4. To know the geographical situation. 5. To know highs and lows of a place. 6. We can also get the information of crop, weather, wind flow, rainfall, minerals, population e tc. from maps MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 105 7. Map is very useful in the engineering and architectural fields. There are so many types of maps; we can choose them as per our requirement. Types of maps: \u00b7 Atlas. \u00b7 Political \u00b7 Thematic \u00b7 Topological \u00b7 Physical \u00b7 Climatic \u00b7 Street map. Who prepares the maps in India? In India, \"Survey of India \" is the institute that makes the map by surveying all the area of India. The village map scale is 1: 25000 and city map scale is 1: 100000. Maps are made after survey. The location becomes certain after measuring t he distance, angle, and location. They need to determine a point from which the mean sea level of the place will be determined. This place is called the benchmark. By benchmark, we may ascertain the height of surrounding places by using dumpy level. Contour lines: In our everyday life, we need to mark the height of some places or mark places with the same height. To flatten the ground for farming, to count the highs and lows of the ground contour lines are useful. To fetch the water from other side, there is necessity to measure the difference in height. The difference in heights is measured by dumpy level or level tube. Spirit level: To keep a surface in plane horizontal level, spirit level is used. Fill the spirit in a tube, by placing a bubble in i t and close the tube by two sides. At the middle of the tube, make a mark of bubble size on tube. When the bubble is between the two lines, the place is horizontal flat. Spirit levels are useful in construction and installations to ensure that the object is installed vertically. e.g. Setting pavements and some machines. Level tube: Every liquid keeps its surface parallel to the horizon line. Using this principle, the level tube is used to determine the parallel lines between two places or objects. This is done by filling a transparent tube with water and comparing the ends of the liquids on both sides of the tube. The same or different levels are seen based on the level of the liquid. We should make sure that there are no bubbles in this liquid. The level t ube is regularly used in construction business. Dumpy level: To draw a map of uneven ground, dumpy level is used. Dumpy level is applicable for survey. It includes spirit level and telescope. Spirit level sets telescope in parallel line. In this conditio n, all the places are in same level. The cross is drawn on the center of telescope. On the top and bottom, there are two horizontal wires MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 106 which are called Stadia. The distance in stadia is in centimeter, that much distance is the distance in meters of the location from the telescope. There is a compass on Dumpy level, by this, we can find out the directions. We may draw a map and contour lines. With the help of dumpy level and staff, height, directions, distance can be found out. Contour lines: To show the altitude of a particular place contour lines are shown. These contour lines join places of equal height on a map. These are used to make decisions while building bunds on rivers and to determine how much water can be stored in such bunds etc. From a spec ific place, the line, which connects two places of same height, is Contour line. We perceive the uneven land by contour lines. The Hills, valley, river, and stream come to notice by this contour lines map. We may identify whether a certain place is flat or steep, or uneven or a hill. Contour lines are drawn at a difference of a specific height. The hills, valley, plateau all the types of can be identified by watching contour lines. The contour lines never cross to each other or coincide into a common point. There is no end to contour lines. The contour lines of peaks and valleys look similar. The uses of contour lines: \u00b7 To find out the place to build dam and weir and to guess the capacity of storage, it is necessary storage length etc. \u00b7 To estimate the work n eeded for excavation \u00b7 To determine whether one place is seen from the other place or not \u00b7 To find out the suitable, appropriate land to construct the rail tracks or roads. \u00b7 Just like we draw contour lines by measuring the height of each point, same can be don e to indicate ground water level at various places. Plane table method: Survey of India is the institute which prepares all kinds of maps in India. Accurate measurements of the land and topography can be done though land survey. The plane table method is t he most widely used method for land survey. It is very easy to teach the students to take measurements and create maps using this method. The plane table survey method can be used to make maps of farms and rural areas. The knowledge of the symbols used for direction, scale and topography is a lifelong advantage for the students. We need two things to find out the exact location of the place. They are the latitude and the longitude of the place. In plane table survey method, each point is marked by checkin g the distance and direction from the survey point and marked on the map as per scale. Once all the important points are marked on the map, these are joined to make the map of the area. Objectives: To draw a map on paper in proportion. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 107 Expected skills: 1. To handle the all instruments 2. To decide the directions of map 3. Map proportion according to drawing sheet. 4.

Complete the map by connecting all -important points Try this: To verify your map accuracy, measure the difference between any two points on map and actual distance o f it on sight. Check the errors if any. Difference will be 25 to 40cm. If it is more than this, the map is incorrect. Example. In fig. A, the area of map is 175cm2 its scale is 1: 500 Actual area from this data is: Ratio 1: 500 Map area 175cm2 Map area uni t is cm2. Therefore, convert it into m2.

A place where saplings of various plants, Grafts, cereal plants are develop/ kept under supervision. Small to large gardens are then prepared from these. Nursery technique has helped in conservation of rare and s pecial plant species in easy way. In a nursery, research is being done on many varieties of plant species in a scientific way. In Nursery, use of advance technology in small spaces , new scientific techniques for productive farming will come into existence for the future. The business of Nursery in India is very old. In a Nursery, Pure breed seeds, grafting and saplings are prepared; the saplings are taken care of and conserved in the most scientific way. Demand for fruit tree & flower saplings is increasin g, thus nurseries are necessary to supply good quality crop breeds. Hybrid seeds are, comparatively, a bit costly. Such seeds can be produced on a large scale at one time, in nurseries. Objectives - Understanding the concept of Nurseries Understanding the procedures and benefits of Nurseries Understanding hybrid plants and methods of preparing the same Studying the methods of filling the buds of plants Nursery Procedures / Integrative Components After deciding about setting up a Nurs ery or nursery, make a plan as follows - Make sure to select the best Nursery. The current and future demand for plants needs to be taken into consideration. How much land do you require? - For the setting up a Nursery, the total area required and the composition of the soil on the land is taken into consideration. Test the soil if needed. Water supply -Water is a prime necessity for a nursery. Check the availability of water. Availability of laborers - Find out which laborers will be required, when and how many. A rough estimate of labour should be drawn, be it permanent, seasonal, skilled, unskilled, supervisory, office work, Nursery work, collections of sale and purchase, etc. Provide proper facilities and training for their overall advancement. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 114 Mother plants - Mother Plants are of great importance in a nursery. Without mother plants, there cannot be a nursery. Maintain a separate division for the same. Sheds for preparing hybrids and saplings, Shed -Net house, green house, arrangement for keeping tools & equipment, many such arrangements are required. Space for growing primed saplings - Preparation of Primed saplings is necessary. Primed saplings are required for preparation of hybrid plants. Services such as electricity, tele phone should be nearby. Road coverage is essential for the customers to reach the nursery or to carry the saplings. Accreditation -Necessary licenses and permissions to be acquired from authorities for setting up a nursery. Consulting technical advice - There arise many problems in Nursery. These problems are technological, financial, management related. A Technical Consultant having information related to nursery is necessary for solving such problems. Importance of Nursery 1) Many slow growing trees can be planted and taken care of properly and can be prepared for further planting. 2) Large number of saplings can be grown in a small space. 3) The plants are well taken care of and well -formed. 4) It becomes easy to control crop diseases. 5) Scientific procedures can be performed on plants like nurturing buds, grafting, providing nutritional supplements etc. 6) The plants can be better fed by water, fertilizers and so on in a timely manner. 7) Productive and well -breed fruit plants and saplings can be cultivated. Types of Nurs ery: A) Depending upon the time required for preparation of the Nursery, nurseries can be divided into 2 types: 1) Seasonal Nursery -This type of nursery is set up to prepare seasonal vegetables and flower saplings. This type of Nursery is usually for duration of 6 to 8 months. For example - Onion, Brinjal, Marigold, etc. 2) Permanent Nursery - In this type of Nursery, saplings of diffe rent types of permanent trees are prepared. There is facility for a maternal or mother tree in this nursery. There is permanent arrangement for preparing saplings in a shed-net and different space to store tools and equipment. This type of nursery is more business oriented, which means that seasonal and all year - round trees saplings are prepared here and supplied to farmers and customers as per demand. For example, saplings o f fruit trees like mango, guava, etc. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 115 and flower bearing tress like rose, hibiscus, jasmine, etc. Plants of wild / indigenous trees - Mahogany etc. Types of nursery as per types of saplings - 1) Nursery of fruit trees - in which only fruit tree seedlings are prepared. E.g. Mango, Chikoo, Guava, Amla, etc. 2) Nursery of Vegetable trees - All types of vegetable seedlings are planted in this nursery. E.g. Onion, Chili, Brinjal, Tomato etc. 3) Nursery of Floral trees - This nursery consists of varieties of seedlings of floral and garden trees. E.g. Rose, Jasmine, etc. 4) Nursery of Wild trees - Nursery in which only wild plant seedlings are grown. E.g. Mahogany, etc. 5) Special Nursery - In this type of Nursery, medicinal, rare, and expensive seedlings are planted. E.g. Ayurvedic medicinal trees, Christmas tree, Bonsai, etc. Methods for seedlings pr eparation or Preparing seedlings in Nursery - There is a difference between sowing in open field and sowing of plants in a Nursery. We will mainly look at sowing seedlings in a nursery. Methods of Sowing Seeds in Nursery - 1) Sowing seeds in a straight line - 2) In this method, fruit, vegetable, or flower seeds, with the help of a machine, are planted i n a straight row. For example - Wheat, Millet, Flowers. Fig - 1 3) Sowing seeds in a flat tray - A flat piece of plastic of a specific shape is taken and soil and fertilizer is mixed on it and seeds are then planted. To avoid vaporizing of water from this tray, a sheet of thermocol or newspaper is put over this as a cover. E.g. - Flowers, etc. 4) Preparation of saplings in bags - A plastic bag of a specific size is taken and seeds are planted in it. A mixture of soil an d fertilizer is put into the bag. To aid seepage of water, 4 -5 holes are made in the bag. The seed s that have undergone seeding process are then planted in this. Fig 2 5) Preparation of seedlings in a seedling tray - In this process, the scraped tray is to be washed with water. Ready cockpit mixture is then added into the tray. Seeds that have undergone seeding process are then planted in it. E.g. Fruits and Vegetables Fig 3 - seedling tray MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 116 6) Cushioned beds - Water seepage is aided well in these beds. These beds should not be in shade. They should receive plenty of sunlight. But a little shade is necessary during summers. The land of these beds should be fragile. There should be no parasite plants, before prep aring these beds the land should be ploughed properly. Decayed Dung manure should be used in these. To aid better seepage of water, a little sand should also be added. The overall shape of this bed should be 3 meters in length, 1 meter in breadth and 15 -20 cm in height or 6 meters in length, 1 -meter wide and 15 -20 cm high. 7) Flat Beds - In the beginning, seeds that are prepared in cushioned beds are planted into flat beds at a later stage. These beds are bigger in size as compared to cushioned beds. The s aplings that are planted from cushioned beds onto these flat beds should be categorically planted at proper distances. The shape of the bed should be based on the size and gradient of the land. The land should be coarse and should aid in proper water seepa ge. Saplings stay for a longer time in these beds. During turnover, some green crop should be planted in these beds. At the same time, precaution should be taken against parasite plants. There should be proper division of the bed, based on the crop. There should be a different zone for preparing of small stubs. This area should be used for turnover. For ease of access to this bed, there should be a walkway between two beds. Care to be taken while sowing the seeds - 1) Seeds used for Sowing should be diseas e free. 2) The seeds should be sowed at a proper depth in the soil. If the seed remains in the upper layer of the soil then the seeds will be picked by birds. On the contrary, if the seeds are sowed too deep, there will be lack of oxygen and the sapling wi ll be under nourished. 3) There should be proper distance between two plants. Every plant gets proper amount of medicine, fertilizer , water and sunlight because of this. 4) Do not plant seeds in dry soil or too wet soil. For sowing seeds, the soil should be wet in a uniform fashion. Some important Components of a Nursery - 1. Maternal or Mother Plant - This is a very important component of Nursery. To produce good quality of trees, only those plants should be cultivated as maternal plants for preparing grafts and buds whose history and quality is known for sure. As getting fruits from these is not the target, these have to be planted at a distance of 2.5meters to 4 meters or 5x5 meters instead of the normal distance. Planting of selective mother trees is an important part of a Nursery. There should be different zones for different mother trees and their names should be mentioned properly. Hybrids prepared from these should be duly noted in different enrolment sheets. There should be proper record of the p lace from where the mother tree is brought, its f amily line and output capacity. 2. Place for keeping pots - Build sheds with shade for keeping pots. Water should be near for watering these pots. There should be separate space for keeping shed leaves. There should also be a separate space for keeping empty pots. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 117 3. Shed for packing saplings All saplings from beds and nurseries have to be packed properly for sending them outstation for sale. There should be a separate shed for this. This space should be big and airy. 4. Warehouse and Offices - There should be a robust repository for material that is required for Nursery. There should be an office just adjacent to this. There should be boards, labels, plastic bags, and other required items in this store. There shou ld be a book with proper record of all the trees from the Nursery. 5. Green House - Green houses are required for cultivating fruit plants, flower plants and decorative plants in a controlled environment, especially in controlled temperature. In a season, normally, 4000 -5000 saplings are cultivated in a 100-sq. meter green house. Taking into consideration a number as 80, around 10,000 to 12,000 hybrids can be prepared in a year. 6. Taking care of grafting and saplings - It is important to maintain the hybrids and saplings in a nursery. So that they will grow properly and the resultant productivity will be good. Taking care of Saplings - 1) Proper action has to be taken against parasite plants in a bed and proper medicine should be sprayed for their eradication. And then the seeds should be planted. 2) Seed treatments procedure should be done before planting the seeds (Process done on seeds to increase their productivity). Seeds having a tough shell should be soaked in warm water for 12 to 24 hours. Similarly, semi -hard- shelled seeds should be soaked for 2 -3 hours. The quantity of Germinator should be 25 ml in 1 litre. Depending on the quantity of seeds, proper amount of liquid mixture should be prepared. 3) Decayed compost should be used in cushioned beds to the quanti ty of 20 -25 kilos. 4) The seeds that have been treated should be sowed in cushioned beds and should be regularly watered. The bed should be covered with dry grass and then water should be poured. 5) To avoid death of saplings, Germinator and Copper oxy -chloride should be used. 6) To avoid infestation, pesticides and fungicides should be used. 7) To retain moisture, some sort of cover should be used. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 118 Taking care of Grafting: - 1) Keep the prepared grafting in shade. 2) The stub on which the grafting has been made, the occasional offshoots should be cut regularly. 3) The joint between two stems of grafting should be very strong. 4) The saplings should be watered regularly and proper care should be taken for their growth. Fig 4 - Grafting 5) To arrest the decaying or infestation of saplings, proper medicines should be used in consultation with the technicians from Agricultural Science Centre. 6) Change the soil in the pots every once in a while. So that all the essential nutrients become availab le to the plant. 1) The quantity of Germinator should be 25 ml in 1 litre. Depending on the quantity of grafts, proper amount of liquid mixture should be prepared. 8) Dip grafting cuts (scion) or buds for 10 -15 minutes in the solution mentioned above. Mana gement of Essential Food nutrients: Always provide essential fertilizers to the mother plants, grafting and saplings in a nursery. The root growth of these plants is limited. So, providing essential nutrients to the roots becomes very easy. Plant propagat ion methods - The process of making new saplings by using the stem, bud of a mother tree is known as propagation technique. Most of the flora around the world gets regenerated by means of self -manufactured seeds. This type of regeneration is specially seen in floral trees. To get well -breed saplings, good quality of seedlings must be used. Since the time humans have started farming, it has been seen that fruit trees do not get all the qualities of the original tree even if its seeds are used for regeneratio n. Joint copulation, Pressed copulation, filling in the buds are the techniques which man can use. Plants can be propagate using two techniques - 1) By use of seeds 2) By use of stems (Any part of the plant) - Majority of the fruit trees except Coconut and Papaya can be grown by using propagation technique using parts of mother tree instead of seeds sowing. In this technique, new sapling can be created by using a part of the original mother tree. The bud or the branch part of fruit tree is used for this technique. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 119 1] Plant Propagation by using Seeds / Sexual reproduction - The regeneration done by use of seeds is the most natural one. As the sapling grown this technique does not get all the qualities of its maternal plant and takes time for bearing frui ts, this technique is not used everywhere. Else, there are some fruit trees in which stem based regeneration is not possible or the technique for such stem based regeneration is not yet developed, hence this technique is used for commercial reasons. Papaya , Coconut, Tamarind, Custard Apple, etc. are regenerated using seed based technique. Following points must be considered while selecting seeds for this type of regeneration - 1) The seeds should be of good breed; Seeds should be taken from maternal tree having good health and productivity 2) Seed should be taken from fully ripened fruit 3) Well -formed and good seeding capacity seed should be used for sowing. 4) The germination of some seeds is less due to the hard shell over it. In such a case, germin ation processing becomes necessary. The shell should be rubbed, seeds should be soaked, deep in cold water, and acid treatments technique should be used for proper growth of such hard -shelled seeds. Advantages of Regeneration using seeds - 1) This is the m ost easy and economical regeneration technique. As a result, saplings can be prepared at a cheaper price as compared to other techniques. 2) Trees grown from seeds are used for generation of new breeds or for preparation of hybrids 3) The trees grown from seeds have a longer lifespan. And these trees bear a lot of fruits. 4) Some fruit trees like Lemon, Papaya can be regenerated using seeds and economical it is very profitable. 5) Plats grown from seeds can generate excellent breed of fruit trees sometimes. E.g. All the well -known of mangoes are first prepared from seeds. Then they are regenerated using stem technique. 6) Stem regeneration is done by use of branches prepared from seed grown trees. Disadvantages of Seed based regeneration - 1) The plants grown from seeds are not of uniform height and growth 2) Seed based trees bear fruits at a slower pace than stem based regenerated trees MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 120 3) The trees grown from seeds are much bigger as compared to those grown from stem based technique. As a result, harvesting, pruning and disinfestation cost increases. 4) Good quality mother plant cannot be grown using its own seeds. Stem based regeneration has to be used for this. 5) The cost of internal nutrition enhancement increases. 2] Stem based regeneration - In this type of regeneration, a part of the mother or maternal plant is used to create new plants. The qualities of the seed tissues are received as a result of this. The plants created from this have all the qualities of the mother plant. Similarly, using physical re generation, absolutely matching trees can be regenerated. Advantages of Stem based regeneration technique - 1) Plants grown using this technique are just like their mother plant. They have the same height, output is the same and quality of fruits is excellen t. 2) The fruits of the trees are of same size and hence it 's harvesting and sale becomes very easy. 3) Some fruits do not bear seeds. Such trees cannot be regenerated using seed based technique. Such trees have to be regenerated using stem based technique. Egg, Banana, P ineapple, Seedless grapes, etc. 4) These trees bear fruits faster than those grown from seed based technique. 5) Some fruit trees do not have disease fighting power. Such trees can be enhanced by grafting a branch of this tree on a tree having good dis ease resisting power. 6) Some trees do not grow in unfavorable climate and soil. Stem based regeneration technique, if used on these trees, can be grown even in unfavorable climate and soil condition. E.g. In North India, Orange stems can be transplanted onto Trifoliate Orange to aid in growth. 7) If stem based technique is used, then the growth of such trees, quality of fruits and productivity can be controlled. By selecting short stems small trees can be grown. As a result, per hectare number of trees can be in creased. 8) Many different types of such hybrid trees can be planted in a Nursery and because of formation of pollen, productivity, and growth increases. 9) By using stem based propagation, many types of fruits can be grown on a single tree. 10) The size of seeds of fruits such as Orange, Sweet lime or the thorns of some fruits can be reduced using stem based technique. 11) If there are some mistakes during Nursery, those can be rectified after the tree bears fruits. Disadvantages of Stem Based Technique - 1) The life span of trees generated from this technique is comparatively less 2) More labour and expenses are incurred for Nursery 3) Hybrids are economically costly Types of Stem based grafting - Grafting by trimming the tree MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 121 Cut Grafts - The stem of a fruit tree is cut into specific shape and size and grafting is made. There are 3 types of this grafting. a) Hard wood cutting - The stem of the grafting is very hard. E.g. Bougainville, Grapes, etc. b) Semi hard wood cutting - The stem in this type is semi hard. E.g. Acolifa, Burberry, etc. c) Soft wood cutting - In this type the stem used is soft and not fully matured. For making these grafting use well breed, healthy and well grown trees. E.g. Duranta, Runners, etc. Simple Tongue Layering - This type of graft is prepared from the offshoots of the maternal tree. In this type, before breaking away the grafting stem, roots get developed on this stem at the time it is cut off the mother plant. For rooting, the bark is removed, scrapped, gaps are created or holes are c reated. This part is then pressed into soil or wrapped with wet moss. This grafting bears roots in a span of 4 - 5 weeks without harming the food and water pipes of the maternal tree, and hence this technique is more successful . Fig 5 - Simple Tong ue Layering Guava regeneration takes place using this technique. Stem of the size of a pencil should be used for this type of grafting. The part where rooting is expected, the leaves around it should be trimmed off. The mature part of the stem should be identified and a cross cut should be made just below its bud. A hole up to 2.5 -3 cm. is made in the stems centre and to keep the cut open a small stick is inserted into it. This stem is inserted into the soil and a stone is kept over it along with an arrange ment for keeping the soil wet. The open stem or its tongue stays in constant contact with the soil. Such a pressed grafting bears roots in a span of 2 - 3 months. After proper rooting, this stem is separated at an interval of 10 -15 days by making 2 -3 cuts. Such pressed grafting can be prepared in a plastic bag also. Air layering - To make this type of grafting, the branch of the mother plant should be shaved off and the open portion should be wrapped with moss or polythene bag. Once proper and sufficient ro oting is found, this portion should be separated from the tree. Polythene cover should be removed when planting this grafting. Pomegranate plants are prepared using this technique. Monsoon season is the best for preparing this type of grafting. If the weat her is favourable, then leaving 2 months of summer, this type of grafting can be prepared throughout the year. To prepare this type, a healthy and matured stem of the maternal tree must be selected. Leaves and branch around the portion that has to be shaved should be removed. This should be done about 45-50 cms below the tip of the branch. Using a knife, the peel of the branch should be shaved off between two buds of the branch. To aid in proper and sufficient rooting in this portion, EDOL BUTERIC ACID should be applied. Then wet moss should be wrapped. Then this entire portion should be covered with a polythene bag and its upper and lower MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 122 ends should be sealed off using jute rope. The shaved portion bears roots in 1 -2 months. Once it bears roots, they are easily visible through the polythene. Once sufficient roots are visible the portion should be cut off from the main branch. In this type of grafting, there is no need for water in the entire process. Monsoon season is best for preparing this type of gr afting. E.g. Pomegranate, Guava, Amla, etc. Fruit trees are regenerated using this technique. A) The grafting stem is not detached from the mother plant - 1. Inarch / Joint grafting - In this type of grafting, the stub and stem are merged together to ge nerate a new tree. In a Joint coupled tree, the upper portion is that of the joint stem. Joint grafting regeneration is used for regeneration of Mango and Chikoo trees. To prepare joint grafting, small trees having stub are prepared. These saplings are then potted. Once the stub is 30 -35 cms in height and thickness resembles that of a pencil, they are brought near the mother plant. The stems of both the trees are matched for thickness and are shaved and joined together. The shaving or cut should be made abo ut 20 -25 cms above the land. The joint gets merged in a span of 50 -60 days. Till such time, these saplings have to be watered regularly. This joint is cut out from the main stem at a distance of 5 cms above the stub once it gets merged. Mango, Chikoo, Cash ew, etc. are regenerated using this technique. Since this technique is a bit tedious and time consuming, this technique is fast falling back in usage. Whip or Tongue Grafting, Saddle Grafting and Root Grafting are included herein. (B) Separating the stem from the Mother Plant: 1. Cleft Grafting - In this technique, the stem of the mother plant is given the shape of an arrow. The stub is given a V -cut and the cut stem is fitted into this. The joint is tied up and sealed using wax. This technique is used in Apple, Pear, etc. saplings preparation. If the diameter of the stub is big, then more than 1 V -cuts are made and similar grafting is done. Fig 6 - Cleft grafting 2. Stone Grafting - Mango is regenerated on a large scale using this technique. In this proc ess, large sized and disease -free seeds of Mangoes are selected. These seeds are spread out on cushioned beds and a 4cm layer of Cow dung manure is laid upon that. As a result, the off -springs from the seeds come out well formed. Hence the question of grafting is sorted out. A seed that has just sprouted and the leaves are dark red in colour should be selected. It should be removed from the bed without hurting the roots. If grafts having green leaves are used, there is less chance of such trees surviving. The stem selected for this technique should be 2 -3 months old with healthy and well-formed buds and should be 10 -15 cms in length. The thickness of this stem and the grafting stem should be the same. Make cuts at 2 -3cms from both ends and give the stem sha pe of an arrow. A hole should be made right in the centre of the selected sapling. The arrow shaped stem should then be inserted into this MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 123 hole. The entire edge of the graft should be wrapped up with a polythene bag. This graft should then be kept in a po t or a 10x20 cms polythene bag in such a way that the grafted portion stays above the soil. The stem starts rooting in a span of 10 -15 days after grafting. Once the leaves attain green colour and once rain reduces, the saplings should be kept in open space. Budding - There is a difference in grafting technique of stems and budding. In other techniques, mother plant having many buds or bud stems are used. But in budding technique, single bud on the stem is used. Lemon, Rose, etc. are regenerated using this technique. A proper breed mother plant 's bud is used in grafting. The resultant tree has all the qualities of the mother plant. Fig 7 - Budding Various methods of budding - T Budding - For filling the buds, the stub should be 9 -12 months old. The thickness of the stub should be the same as that of a pencil. On this stub, 1/3rd diameter deep cuts should be made at a height of 15 -20 cms. Starting from the centre of these cuts, vertical cuts should be made, that too of 25 -40 mm. Which means the cuts should resemble English \"T\". Using the back of the knife, the outer peel should then be loosened up. Care should be taken that the internal wood or bark is not damaged. Then the bud on the stem should be removed using a sharp knife by making cuts at a dista nce of 10 mm below the bud. The bud is then fitted into the T cut made earlier. Care should be taken that the peel or bark covers the internal tentacles of the bud. For sealing this joint, Wax or strip of cloth or strip of plastic should be used. While tyi ng the strip, care should be taken to keep the bud open. The buds get fitted firmly within a span of 2 -3 weeks. When the piece if the leaf stem falls, it is a sign that the bud has fit properly. The main stub should be trimmed off about 25 mm above the gr afted bud. Fig 8 - T Budding Patch Budding: In this technique, the peel is taken from the stub. It should be around 25 mm long and 10 mm wide. A similar sized piece containing the bud is removed from the stem. For this, deep cuts are made on all four sides of the bud. As a result, the bud along with the patch gets removed easily. This patch is fitted on the stub from where the first peel is removed. Immediately that portion is tied up using polythene strips. Care should be taken to keep the bud open. After about 2 months, the strip should be removed. This technique is very rarely used.

Proper planning is essential for conservation of rain water . Every year we store the rain water and prepare plans for water supply; but this planning falls short because of delayed monsoon . Then the struggle for water starts. Controlled usage of water is necessary to fulfill the needs of a growing population. In this chapter, we are going to learn about water conservation and irrigation methods. Objectives \u00b7 Understanding the need and metho ds of water c onservation. \u00b7 Study of different irrigation Water Conservation The need of water -conservation: - Freshwater contributes to o nly 2% of the total water on the earth . Groundwater contributes to 11% of total freshwater. Ground water is a very scarce and a valuable natura l resource. Due to uncontrolled usage of water, the amount of ground water is gradually decreasing. Rain water harvesting is essential to improve the ground water level. What is rain water harvesting? Rain wa ter harvesting is the method for conservation or storage of rain water . Simply put, it means collecting the rain water from the roof tops of homes, storing it and then using it later after purification. Urban Areas Rural Areas Rooftop run off water collection Recharge pits Recharge trench Tube wells Recharge wells Gully plug Level -line dam/Contour Bund Gabion Structure Percolation tanks Check dams/Drain Dams Recharge shafts/trenches Dug well recharge Ground water dams/Subsurface dams In rural areas, the main technique is surface spreading (let rain water soak over maximum area) since large open surfaces of land are available for soaking. Following methods can be used to avoid flow away from roofs, slopes, rivers, rivulets, and drains: Gully plugs: - Ground water enrichment in rural areas: - MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 126 These small dams are built using locally available stones, clay, nearby bushes across small gullies and streams running down the hill slopes and are used to accumulate and soak the water from streams and rills flowing d own the hillside slopes. This helps in improving the moisture level and fertility of the soil. Such gully plugs can be built where there is a local break in slope and the flow of water is blocked or slows down. The system of bunds connecting places at sam e elevation (level -line dam) is very useful in retaining soil moisture in the watershed for long time. Useful in low rainfall area Percolation tank : - It is suitable for highly permeable land. In this water conservation method surface water runoff is made to percolate & recharge the ground water storage . We can provide this storage water to nearby wells . The objective of these kind of tanks is to facilitate water absorption and recharge levels of ground water. With the help of recharge pits we can store rain water. We can use this water conservation method in area where surface rocks are permeable. The recharge pits are constructed 1 -2 meters wide and 2 -3 meter deep. The pits are then filled with boulders (5 t o 20 cms), gravel and coarse sand, so that the silt content that will come with runoff water will be easily removed. Fig 10 - Recharge pits For the buildings with smaller roof areas, the pit can be filled with pieces of broken bricks and gravel . To maintain the water recharge rate, it is essential to periodically clean up the silt and other waste materials from the top layer o f sand. Rain water harvesting is a process of storage the water from rain fall and then using it later at appropriate time. Simply put, it means collecting the rain water from the roof tops of homes, storing it and then using it later after purification. Why rain water harvesting? Today, scarcity of quality water has become a major problem. Available sources drinking water are depleting. Considering this, it is essential to enrich the available natural sources of water. The rain water is left unused and lost as run off. Therefore, rain wa ter harvesting is necessary. Benefits of rain water harvesting: \u00b7 Rain water harvesting can become a supplement for other sources of water supply . (e.g. groundwate r or municipal water) \u00b7 The areas with out water supply Rain water harvesting has a a bility to build or for farming. Recharge pits: - What is rain water harvesting? MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 127 \u00b7 Recourse of pure, chemicals free and h igh quality water . \u00b7 Reduced flood situations \u00b7 Prevention of topsoil loss Irrigation - Water supply is very important for crops. Crops cannot grow without water. Compared to seasonal crops, the roots of fruit bearing trees go deep underground. Since fruit crops are perennial they need continued water supply even after rainy season. Crops can utilize only 50% of the water supplied, the rest is wasted by seepage in the ground and by evaporation. Also, due to overwatering, all the water cannot get soaked into the ground and soil becomes marshy, saline, and infertile (non -cultivable). It also res ults in a lot of wastage of water and reduction in crop production. Water is scarce and its utilization must be monitored strictly and scientifically. Water must be used cautiously and appropriately and watershed development programs must be undertaken to increase the water level underground and in wells. Instead of traditional/conventional water supply methods modern irrigation techniques must be adopted. Nowadays various modern irrigation facilities are available. Using these modern technologies for irrig ation the crop production can be increased multi -fold. For horticultural purpose, if advanced irrigation systems are used instead of traditional methods, water is saved and supplied to a larger area of the farms. It also reduces the risk of pests and disea ses and increases yield. There are two types of irrigation methods for fruit crops - traditional and modern. Instead of using an irrigation method because it is common in the area, appropriate method should be chosen depending on the soil condition and cro p. Before deciding the irrigation system to use it is essential to study the type of soil, availability of water, type of crop, water supply mechanism, and cultivation method. In this chapter, we are going to study various types of irrigation methods. Irrigation methods Traditional methods Modern methods Ground Surface irrigation Drip Irrigation Sprinkler Irrigation Subsurface Irrigatio n Check Basin Irrigation Pla nt basin Irrigation Furrow Irrigation Pot Irrigation Types of irrigation systems: MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 128 Traditional Methods: - Check basin irrigation method is used for levelled fields where ample water is available. In this method, there is a probability of wastage of water due to seepage in drains and of water logging. This method is used for crops cultivated at low interval distances like bananas, papaya. In this method, the whole field is divided into basins . The basins are connected through drain type flow ways. There is a possibility of excess water accumulation and damage to the crops due to water logging. Fig 11 - Check Basin Irrigation In this irrigation method, furrows are made between two rows of trees and water is supplied via the furrows. The local fruit orchards do not use this method of irrigation. This method is recommended for fru it orchards with medium quality of soil. Water should be released slowly in these furrows, so that instead of flowing away it will seep into the nearby soil. For small fruit trees, the water from the furrows on both the sides is sufficient. As the trees gr ow, the number of furrows between the two rows of trees is increased for supplying the required amount of water. Fig 12 - Furrow irrigation The furrows should be long and there should be 5 feet distance between the furrows. If the ground had slope, the furrows should be made across the slope. The slop should not be more than 0.6 %. In this method water is wasted by evaporation. This method is not suitable for dry sandy/desert soil. In southern India, in saline soil farmers place an earthen pitcher filled with water at the base of the tree . This is a very easy and cost -effective method for supplying water to trees on unlevelled surfaces. This method needs more manual labour. It provides all the same benefits of drip irrigation. This method is very good for saving the trees in areas with shortage of water. A hole is made at the bottom of the earthen pitcher and it is fi lled with coconut husk so that water drips slowly at the root of the trees and supplied the required moisture. Fig 13 - Pot irrigation 1.Check Basin Irrigation : 2.Furrow Irrigation : 3.Pot Irrigation : MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 129 Modern methods: - In this method, small amount of water as per the type of crop is supplied with the help of narrow pipes of diameter 12 - 16 mm. A computerized sensors can be used to measure soil moisture or soil water content and schedule drip irrigation. Water can be sup plied directly to the base of the trees using this cost -effective irrigation method. There are different mechanisms used for this. Fig 14 - Drip irrigation In drip irrigation, mainly a network of main pipe, sub main pipes and laterals is created. The water undergoes filtration before coming in the drip pipes. The main, submain and lateral pipes are made of plastic and they have perforations at regular intervals which supply water at the roots. This is the most superior method of irrigation which re sults in high quality crop yield in minimum amount of water, minimum expense, and short time intervals. Drip irrigation give high levels of crop growth. In addition, liquid fertilizers can be supplied via the drip irrigation system. This system is very ben eficial for orange, Chikoo, lemon, pomegranate, pineapple, coconut, guava, mango, papaya, banana, spices, and vegetables. \u00d8 Properties of drip irrigation: - 1. Water is supplied at low speeds 2. Water is mostly supplied as per need 3. Water is supplied at the base of the trees closer to the root system 4. Water is supplied at low pressure. \u00d8 Benefits of drip irrigation: - 1. Efficient utilization of available water 2. High level of crop growth and significant increase in yield 3. Reduced risk of damage from underground salts 4. Easy and efficient use of fertilizers and other chemical solutions (insecticides) 5. Less nuisance of weed and time saved in maintenance 6. Less electricity and manual labour needed \u00d8 Limitations of drip irrigation: - 1. Accumulation of salts near the roots 2. The root s grow in a limited area 3. High cost of initial investment 4. Possibility of blockages in the perforations on the pipes 5. Risk of damage to the plastic pipes 1.Drip Irrigation : MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 130 In this method water is sprinkled under high pressure through pipes. This method is convenient for areas affected by high levels of soil erosion and uneven ground levels. Water can be supplied effectively to uneven ground with this method and the expense to level the surface can be avoided. Small plants and fully -grown trees both can be watered appropriately. Fertilizers can be provided via the water. The couplers can be easily attached or detached, so the lig htweight pipes can be easily moved and connected as required. Even if the ground has uneven slopes the pipeline can be setup as needed. The automatic sprinklers are attached on these pipes at convenient intervals. Fig 15 - Sprinkler irrigation After the pump is started, the water is lightly sprinkled adding moisture to the soil. Sprinklers of various heights are readily available, so this method can be used for any kind of crops. The method of connecting the pipes is easy. Even one worker can supply wate r to a large area with this method. Though the initial investment of this system is high, it proves to be cost effective considering the amount of water saved and the increased yield. This irrigation system is useful for fruit trees of moderate height e.g. guava, pomegranate, pineapple. In the initial days of the cultivation in a fruit orchard, this system can be used for irrigation. \u00d8 Benefits of sprinkler irrigation: - 1. Wastage of water during transport is avoided 2. Effective area under cultivation can be d oubled 3. Large amount of water is saved 4. This method can be easily utilized in areas with sandy, erosion -prone soil and uneven ground levels. 5. Fertilizers and insecticides can be provided via the sprinkler system \u00d8 Drawbacks of sprinkler irrigation: - 1. Wastage o f water if the climate is hot and dry 2. Electricity is necessary to supply water 3. Hi cost of initial setup 4. There is a need for technical personnel to run this system 5. Useful for only certain types for fruit crops This method is suitable for fruit orchards. Before supplying water using this system, sand and screen filters are required to filter the water. Water soluble fertilizers are effectively supplied directly at the roots via the bi -wall tubes. This 2.Sprinkler Irrigation : 3.Subsurface Irrigation or Bi -wall irrigation : MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 131 method is also called as \"Bi-wall method \". For the crops cultivated in rows and in confined areas (vegetables, tomatoes, sugarcane, pineapple, bananas etc.) \u00d8 Benefits of bi -wall irrigation: - 1. Wastage of water by evaporation is avoided 2. Avoids damage to roots caus ed by water logging 3. Land area is not wasted as there is no need to have furrows 4. Very low maintenance, complete utilization of water and fertilizers is achieved Some fruit trees can have a different type of root structure. So, there is a slight change done in the drip irrigation system. Instead of drip supply, water is given as a higher volume adjustable flow directly at the base of the trees. Bubbler system has o ne fundamental difference - in this method the sub pipes bring water to each tree, and there is a lateral pipe at the base of the tree which provides water in a basin around the tree. Water is supplied at the speed of 225 litres per hour. In this method, the speed of water supply is significantly higher than the rate of absorption, so the water is accumulated and a small basin around the tree is necessary.

Crops receive essential nutrients from the soil. Out of these nutrients, crops require nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash in large quantities. So, their percentage in the soil changes always. For testing the quantity of nutrients essential for the crops, and the percentage of lack of them, i.e. for testing the fertilit y of soil, different physical, chemical and biological methods like soil testing, crop analysis, growth of organisms, etc. are there. In these testing methods, soil and plant samples are taken and tested in the laboratory or inspection and experiments are done in the farm itself. Testing of soil samples indicates which nutrients are deficient in the soil and whether the soil is suitable for growth of crops or not. Also, the relation between soil testing and crop yield indicates the percentage of nutrients received by the crops from the soil and the amount of nutrients needed to supply from outside. From testing, the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil are understood. Accordingly, if required organic fertilizers, bio fertilizers and chemical fertilizers are provided in integrated way, the he alth of th e soil can be maintained. Objectives: - \u00b7 To understand the necessity of soil testing \u00b7 To understand the information about the essential nutrients for plant growth \u00b7 To study the detailed concept of the method of identifying the pH of soil using soil testing The care and precautions to be taken while testing the soil: - 1. While handling the soil testing kit, take care that the chemicals do not spill on the soil. 2. Use dropper wherever it is instructed to be used. 3. While handling acid, take care that it do es not spill. 4. Follow all the instructions given in the user guide. Method of taking a sample: - 1. The tools used for collecting samples e.g. spade, hoe, ghamela, sickle should be clean. 2. The soil sample should be collected after harvesting of crops but before next ploughing. Fig 16 - Soil sample 3. If chemical fertilizers are given to the crop, do not collect sample from the respective soil, for three months. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 133 4. Do not mix samples of different types of soils or soils from different farms. 5. Do not use empty bag s of chemical fertilizers for collecting a soil sample or for sending it to the laboratory for testing. 6. Soil samples should not be collected from or near these places: the storage space of the fertilizers in the farm, garbage place, and animal shed, under the tree, wells, water channels and boundaries of farms. Method to collect the soil sample: - 1. When you go to the farm for collecting soil sample, first inspect the farm, and divide the farm into different sections as per the soil type. While determining these sections, consider things like colour of the soil, texture, unevenness, marshy land. In this way, collect a separate representative sample from each section. 2. Collect soil from 15 to 20 places from one hectare of farm. For taking soil sample, make a zigzag line in each section, and dig at every curve. Remove plant parts, trash, or stones from every selected place. At each place, make a 25 cms. Pit of 'V' shape for seasonal crop and 60 cms. Deep pit for fruit crop. Take out soil from that pit. 3. From al l the sides of pit, the soil layer should be scraped from top to bottom evenly and it should be collected in a clean pan and collected on a gunny bag. 4. In this way, make pits on all the marks and mix the collected soil well and divide it into four parts. Ex cept the two opposite parts, mix the remaining two parts again and divide them into four parts. Again, skip the two parts opposite each other. 5. Continue doing this till the soil in one part is handful or half kg. Along with the soil sample, write the detai led information about name of the farmer, name of the village, district, survey/group number and the crop to be cultivated in the next season and then send the sample to the soil testing laboratory. Making the soil sample ready for testing: - After the so il sample is collected, it needs to be processed before its analysis. So that sample becomes fit for testing. The soil sample dried in the shade should be crushed lightly in a wooden mortar and remove plant parts, gravel, and other unwanted things from it. The crushed sample should be sifted using 2 mm sieve. The sample thus prepared, should be used to test the factors like pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash. For testing the organic carbon content, a sample of very small weight is needed. The sample creat ed above should be again crushed in a wooden mortar and sifted from 0.5 mm sieve. This very fine sample should be used to test organic carbon. Learn to test the soil (pH of soil and percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and prepare the repor t- To measure pH of soil and percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, colour chart is used. Required chemicals are added to the soil sample and then the changed colour of the soil is matched with the color chart . This gives results for pH of soi l, percentage of nitrogen, phosp horus and potassium in the soil. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 134 Identifying pH of the soil: - As per pH of the soil, to be able to identify whether the soil is acidic, alkaline, or neutral . Equipment and chemicals: - Soil agar, test tube, rubber cap, methyl orange, barium sulphate etc. Soil testing colour chart PH of the soil: - PH indicates the percentage of acid and alkali in the soil. PH of 7 is considered as neutral. If pH is 7 -14, the alkalinity is more and if pH is between 0 -7 acidity is more. But pH of the soil should be between 6.5 to 8.5. Fig 17 - Soil testing Procedure : - 1) Take water up to 5 ml. mark in a clean test tube and using 2 gm spoon from the soil testing kit, add soil sample to the water. 2) Add barium sulphate of 0.06 to 1 gm weight in the test tube. Close the test tube with a clean rubber cap. And let the test tube stand for 20 minutes. Stir the mixture in it in between. 3) After 20 minutes, a dd 5 drops of methyl red in it, close the test tube with another clean cap and mix the mixture well by shaking it. Let the test tube stand so that the soil settles down at the bottom of the test tube. 4) After the soil settles, match the colour of the soil so lution with the colour chart. 5) If as per the chart, pH of the soil is around 6, repeat this experiment by taking soil again and replacing methyl red with methyl orange. Match the colour of solution with the colour in the chart. Precaution and care: - 1. Do no t collect soil sample in the rainy season. 2. From one farm, collect samples from 10 -15 different places, of the soil at depth of 15 to 30 cms. Observations and conclusion: - Observation of pH Conclusion < 6.5 Soil is acidic in nature, to improve it appropriate quantity of lime should be mixed with it. 6.5 to 7.5 The percentage of acid and alkali in the soil is the same. The soil is suitable for any crop. <7.5 Soil is alkaline in nature, it is necessary to mix Sulphur in appropriate quantity.

Observations and conclusion: -By comparing the colour of solutions in both the test tubes with colour chart, determine the kg/hectare percentage of nitrate, nitrogen and ammoniacal nitrogen in the soil. Additional information: Main nutrients in the pl ants and their functions: - A) Main nutrients in the plants: - This includes six nutrients viz. carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash. These nutrients are absorbed by the plant in the large quantity. So, they are called as main nutrients. Out of them oxygen, hydrogen and carbon are required by plants in very large quantity. But generally, the plants don 't face deficiency of these nutrients as they are easily available from water and air in the soil. These three basic nutrients are very im portant for biological processes. Out of total weight of the plant approximately more than 94% is occupied by these three nutrients. The function of creating energy is related to these nutrients. Apart from them, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash are also r equired by the plants on large scale. These nutrients which are soluble in the soil moisture are MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 137 used by the roots of the plants. The supply of these nutrients from the soil is generally in medium to low quantity. So, to fulfil the requirement of the plant s, organic as well as chemical fertilizers need to be given. B) Secondary nutrients for the plants - The three nutrients calcium, sulphur and magnesium are called as secondary nutrients for plants. Which requires in medium quantity. C) Micro nutrients for the plants - These include eight nutrients: manganese , zinc, copper, iron, molybdenum, boron, chlorine, nickel, cadmium. The plants need micro nutrients in small quantity. These nutrients are sufficiently supplied to the plants from the soil naturally. But in the specific soil and for specific crops, these nutrients need to be provided by organic/ chemical fertilizers. Apart from these nutrients, some specific crops need nutrients like sodium, cobalt, silicon. Functions of main nutrient s in the plants: - 1. Nitrogen : - Due to this nutrient, the plant grows many leaves, the growth is vigorous and fast. More shoots grow and it ensures increase in the yield. The photosynthesis increases. The protein content in the grains as well as leafy an d fruit vegetables increases and quality of the agricultural product improves. The fresh, shiny green colour of the crop depends on the chlorophyll content in the plant. The amount of chlorophyll depends on the nitrogen supply to the plant. 2. Phosphorus : -Phosphorus has significant role in bio -chemical processes in the plant. Due to these nutrients, mainly growth of the roots becomes fast and vigorous, and the capability of the plants to absorb water and other nutrients increases. This stimulates product ion of carbohydrates, fats, and protein. These nutrients help to increase oil content in the oil seeds and protein contents in cereals, pulses. Due to nitrogen, mainly vegetative growth of the plant is stimulated. Phosphorus increases reproduction activiti es. So, the crop enters flowering stage early and becomes mature early. The number and size of nitrogen fixation nodules on the dicotyledonous plants increases due to Phosphorus. So, the nitrogen fixation process increases. Due to sufficient supply of nitr ogen and phosphorus, the capacity of plants to withstand water stress in the drought situation also increases. 3. Potash : - The role of potash in the biological processes in the plant is important. Because of potash the skin, stems or leaves of plants get strength. So, the crop does not fall on the ground but stands vigorously. It is not susceptible to the diseases and pests. For the crop to stand sturdily and to achieve maximum yield even in the adverse situations like less moisture in the soil, salinity, very cold weather and cloudy weather, potash is very important. Due to this substance, mainly the processes like production of carbohydrates and their conversion into sugar become active. So, sugar containing crops like sugarcane, watermelon, sweet potato , and fruits need this nutrient more. Due to this nutrient, the sugar content increases. It gives good colour and shape to the fruits. It increases the shelf life of fruits -flowers and vegetables. So, in turn it helps to improve quality of the agricultural product. The quality of fibres in the fibrous crops improves. So, the crops like cotton and jute need potash more. 4. Calcium : -The nutrient, calcium is present in the cell walls of plants in the form of calcium pectate. For proper functioning of roots a nd increasing cell MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 138 division, this nutrient is essential. Organic acids are created in the plants continuously and if their amount becomes excess, they are harmful. Calcium works on decreasing this acidity. For making different bio -chemical processes happen in the plants and to speed them up, specific organic substance containing protein are active, they are called as 'enzymes '. Calcium helps for actions related to enzymes. This nutrient helps to increase the number of nitrogen fixation nodules on the roots and their size, so that the capability of di - cotyledon family crops to fix nitrogen increases. 5. Magnesium : - Magnesium is an important element in the chlorophyll of the plants. This nutrient has a role in the function of photo synthesis. Like calcium, this nutrient is helpful to keep actions due to enzymes active. The citrus family trees which grow in the soil containing lime stone face more magnesium deficiency. 6. Sulphur: -This nutrient is very essential for crops for preparing protein, fats, and ch lorophyll. In pulses and oilseed crops, the amount of proteins and oils respectively increases due to this nutrient. Sulphur is helpful to produce Sulphur containing amino acids in the plants (e.g. methionine, cysteine, and growth regulators (e.g. thiamine , biotin). Due to this, there is more nitrogen fixation. Absorption is almost as much as phosphate; the quality of agricultural product improves. So, after nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash, now a days Sulphur is mentioned as the fourth main nutrient.

But artificial insemination method is the most modern method. In artificial insemination method, direct contact between cow and bull is avoided and breeding is done using modern technology. In this method, the semen artificially collected from the bull is deposited into the reproduct ive tract of the cow at the right time, as it is or after specific processing, using technical methods. Artificial insemination method is useful for the overall improvement of the cattle. In this chapter, we are going to take detailed information about art ificial insemination in cows and buffaloes. Objectives: - \u00b7 To understand the concept of artificial insemination \u00b7 Get information about various hybrid breeds \u00b7 To study actual methods of artificial insemination Artificial insemination : - India ranks first in the world in terms of number of milk cattle. But out of total milk production in the world, only 6% milk is produced in India and in per capita production India ranks 94th in the world. Our native cow gives 100 to 300 litres of milk in a year. For increasi ng milk production, we need to improve quality of cows. To make improved cow using the traditional method (genetical method) we will need a span of 70 to 80 years. After so many years, the milk production from this improved cow will be of only 600 litres. So, the fast and easy way to increase milk production in India is artificial cross breeding. Compare native and hybrid cows given below. Fig 18 - Artificial insemination Native cow Hybrid cow First brood After40 -42 months After20 -22 months Lactation period 150-180 days 240-300 days Next brood After 6 -8 months After 3 -4 months Dry period 7-8 months 2-4 months Duration between two broods 18-20 months 13-15 months Average milk 3 litres per day 8 litres per day Total milk 540 litres 24000 litres Growth of calves 200-300 gms daily 500-700 gms daily By studying the above chart, we understand that we need to decrease number of unwanted cattle and increase cattle of good quality. For that, cross breeding of cattle is a good solution. Those who have n ative cows, should cross breed the MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 140 best cow they have by artificial insemination. The calf which is produced from this cow, will have first brood after 2.5 years and more milk will be produced. Many people give fodder to the cow in the farm itself. But it has low productivity as compared to the fodder given. So, there is unnecessary expense for fodder. The unwanted animals which are let loose in the in the villages destroy trees planted in the farms and villages so the villages become barren. To avoid all these, we need to cut down the number of unwanted cattle and need to create cattle with the best productivity. It will be beneficial to get a hybrid calf by cross breeding the native cow. This hybrid cow will eat grass of 3 cows, but will give milk of 4 co ws. So, in return of the expenses for fodder, we can get good productivity with the hybrid cow. So, the village and the dairy farmers will not face losses but will be benefited. What is artificial insemination: - In artificial insemination, the breeding is done by avoiding direct contact of cow with bull. In this method, semen is collected from bull artificially and it is deposited into the reproductive tract of the cow or buffalo, as it is or after dilution. Somet imes, in this method semen of the bull is collected in an artificial vagina. Then this semen is inspected under microscope. And then semen mixture is created by adding some chemicals and yellow egg yolk. This mixture is kept in the refrigerator for 6 -7 hou rs at 5 degrees Celsius in very cold liquid nitrogen. Methods of artificial insemination - For artificial insemination, 1 ml diluted semen is released in the uterus or cervix of the cow. Two main methods are used for artificial insemination - 1. Recto -vaginal method : - This method is widely used. In this method, a rubber or plastic gloved hand is inserted into the anus and cervix is held and using another hand a plastic tube for insemination is inserted from vaginal track into the cervix and semen is inserted through the tube into the uterus. 2. Speculum method : - In this method, a special type of forceps, speculum is inserted through vaginal track and cervix is inspected through it with the help of light. Then semen is taken in the insemination tube and that tube is inserted in the cervix and using syringe, the semen from tube is released in the uterus. 3. Efficiency of artificial insemination: - The percentage of conception by artificial insemination is more than conception by natural breeding. If th ere is infertility or reproductive diseases then artificial insemination is more beneficial than traditional breeding methods. Some bulls are not that good for using inartificial insemination, but if proper care is taken, the percentage of conception can i ncrease significantly. Care to be taken in artificial insemination: - 1. The place where artificial insemination is to be done must be clean. 2. All material and instruments to be used for artificial insemination should be sterilized. E.g. gloves, long forceps e tc. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 141 3. Keep away from the bowl in which actual semen is stored. Substances in the bowl can be harmful to the body. 4. While performing actual insemination, take special care of skin and eyes. 5. Always use long stainless -steel forceps. 6. Avoid artificial insemination in very hot weather. 7. Provide open space for the cattle to stand.

The hump of the bulls of this breed is big and graceful . The bulls are agile and sturdy. This breed is not good for milk but the bulls of this breed are famous. Dangi : - The cattle of this breed are found in Dang, Nashik and some parts of Konkan. The characteristics are oily skin and strong legs. The animals have white and black spots. As the bulls are very strong, they are good for draft purposes. C. Dual purpose breeds: - Deoni: -The animals of this breed are found in Marathwada, Hyderabad, Udgir, Devgiri area. They are white in colour and sometimes red, brown spots are also seen. The body is big and long. Haryana: - The animals of this breed are found in some parts of Haryana, Punjab. They are big but proportionate. The colour is white, slightly light red and sometimes bluish.

Horns are long, thick, and curved. Mehsana: -The animals of this breed are found in Mehsana district in Gujrat and adjoining areas. The colour is black and grey. White spot on the forehead. Tail end has a white spot. Benefits of artificial insemination: - 1. Many dairy farmers can benefit from the proven bull that has genes of good milk production. 2. In natural breeding, one bull can impregnate 50 to 60 cows in a year. On the other hand, using artificial insemination one bull can impregnate thousands of cows. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 143 3. Every dairy farmer need not keep a bull. He can get rid of the expenses and trouble of maintaining the bull. 4. The expenses for artificial insemination are very less as compared to the expens es of maintaining a bull. This is particularly true for a dairy farmer having a small number of cattle. 5. The reproductive diseases which are spread by natural breeding do not spread via artificial insemination. 6. In natural breeding, it cannot be detected ear ly if the semen of the bull is not suitable for breeding. On the other hand, in artificial insemination, the semen of the bull is tested first so there is no chance of using unsuitable bull. 7. In natural breeding, it is difficult to use big sized bulls for small cows. This problem is eliminated in the artificial insemination. 8. Some bulls are not useful for natural insemination due to injury or some other reasons. Such bulls can also be useful in artificial insemination. Drawbacks of artificial insemination (limitations): - 1. For artificial insemination, a skillful and trained person is needed. Otherwise it might result into injury to the animal and there will be less chances of conception. 2. The instruments to be used for artificial insemination need to be clean and sterilized. If it is neglected, it can lead to spreading of disease. 3. As bull is not needed for artificial insemination, sale of the pure breed bulls can decrease significantly.

The animals need to get balanced fodder regularly throughout the year. But it is not possible due to irregular rains, lack of water and lack of land needed for fodder. If there is less availability of green fodder during summ er, then milk production decreases even if the production capacity of the animals is more. But keeping consistency in milk production is very important for dairy farmers. For that, it is necessary to understand the process to prepare fodder. In this chapte r, we are going to understand, different animal fodder preparation methods. Objectives: - \u00b7 To understand the concept of animal fodder \u00b7 To study the methods to prepare animal fodder \u00b7 To study the effect of fodder on the animals The animals need fodder for two reasons - 1) physical growth 2) Productivity or for ability to work. All the fodder given to the animals may not be digested. As per the type of fodder and its ingredients, its digestible contents differ. Feed Management: - Animals need feed for the nour ishment of body and for milk production. The diet from which the nutrients needed for nourishment of body and for milk production are provided in digestible form and which satisfies the hunger is called as 'nutritious diet '. Generally, a cow/ buffalo pro ducing 10 litres of milk (weight approximately 400 kgs) needs 6 -8 kgs dry fodder, 25 kgs green fodder and 5 -6 kgs concentrates. If dry fodder and green fodder is converted into chaff, 25% feed is saved. Generally, animals need dry fodder equal to 2 to 2.5 % of their weight. If dry fodder is not available, they need green fodder equal to 4 to 6% of their weight. That means, generally a fully -grown animal needs 8 to 10 kgs of dry fodder and 20 to 30 kg/s of green fodder. The feed and water required for anima ls Animal category Average weight (kg) Average feed per day (kg) Average water per day (litre) Cow and buffalo category 150 3 3 to 4 175 5 5 to 20 200 5 to 6 20 to 22 250 5 to 7 18 to 27 350 9 45 to 65 500 10 90 to 100 From the given chart, we can estimate how much feed and water should be given to the animals. So accordingly, diet should be decided rationally. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 145 Methods of fodder preparation: - What is Silage? When the green fodder is stored in a closed environment without destroying its nutrients, its sugar content is decomposed by the bacteria and lactic acid, acetic acid is produced from it. These acids do not allow fungus or microorganisms of that kind to grow in the stored fodder. So, the stored fodder is preserved with its nutrient conte nts and green colour. It is called as silage. But for that fodder needs to be stored in an anaerobic condition for at least one month. If air enters the stored fodder, the fungus grows on it and it is decayed. The silage can be made of mono - cotyledon fodd er crops like corn, sorghum, pearl millet, oat, and the grass on farm boundaries. Preparing Silage: - 1. In cold weather, more energy is required to control the body temperature. 2. For fulfilling the energy demand, feed the cattle with high energy fodder and feed. 3. This need can be fulfilled by increasing quantity of animal feed by 0.5 to 1 kg per animal, too. 4. In the beginning of winter, green fodder is abundantly available and then day by day availability of green fodder decreases, we can convert the excess f odder into silage & store it for future use. 5. Considering 15 kg silage for one animal, and the number of days for which the fodder needs to be stored, plan to prepare silage. 6. To prepare silage, corn fodder in a flowering stage, should be cut to chaff and pressed and kept in air tight condition. 7. The paddy, wheat straws, soybean and Bengal gram bran should be treated with urea and jaggery to increase the nutritional value of this low -quality fodder. For that, 100 kg fodder should be treated with 3 kg urea, 1 kg jaggery, 1 kg salt and 20 liter of water and should be kept in air tight condition for 21 days and then used. 8. Sugarcane leaves are used as animal feed, which has high percentage of oxalate. Oxalate cannot be digested by animals. When it is being thrown out of body, it creates a compound called as 'calcium oxalate ' and it also takes out calcium along with it. To avoid it, one kg quick lime should be added to water and kept overnight and the lime water created should be sprayed on the sugar cane leaves and it should be fed to the cattle after 24 hours. For preparing silage, buy a bag with 5 feet diameter and 4 feet height and a plastic role and prepare silage in it. First tie one end of the plastic role firmly. Cut a three -meter role and keep it in the bag. Add fodder chaff and some mineral mixture to it and press it well. Tie the other end of plastic role again. Make it air tight and seal the bag by stitching. The silage fulfils demand of fodder for next four months. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 146 Azolla - food supplement - Azolla is a type of fern . This is aquatic plant. Azolla pr oduction: - \u00b7 The land is levelled and cleaned. \u00b7 Bricks should be lined horizontal way in a rectangular style. Azolla \u00b7 A thin UV stabilized silpaulin sheet of 2m x 2m size is spread all over the bricks . The sheet spread in such a way that it should cover the margin of the rectangle which made by bricks \u00b7 10-15 kg sieved soil is spread over the silpaulin pit \u00b7 2 kg cow dung is made into slurry and 30 gm super phosphate is mixed in 10 liters of water, and poured on the sheet. \u00b7 About 0.5 to 1 kg pure azolla mother culture seeds, soil and water is mixed uniformly and spread on the azolla. \u00b7 Water should be immediately spread on the azolla bed. \u00b7 Within a period of one week, azolla spreads on the bed everywhere and looks like a thick mat. \u00b7 20 gm supe r phosphate and approximately 1 kg of cow dung should be added once in 5 days so that azolla grows fast and it can consistently give 500 gm yield daily. \u00b7 Micronutrients mix which contains magnesium, iron, copper, and Sulphur etc. should also be mixed once i n a week. So that the mineral content of the azolla increases. \u00b7 Once in every 30 days, approximately 5 kg soil from bed should be replaced with fresh soil so that it acts as a solution for increase in nitrogen and micro nutrients deficiency, too. \u00b7 After ever y 10 days, 25 to 30% water should also be replaced, so that it will keep check on the increase in nitrogen on the beds. \u00b7 Bed should be kept clean. Water, soil should be replaced and new azolla should be planted every six months. Harvesting: - \u00b7 Azolla will grow fast and will spread all over the pit in 10 -15 days. From that time onwards, 500 -600 gms of azolla can be harvested every day. \u00b7 From the 15th day, it can be harvested using a sieve or a tray. Washed azolla with fresh water so that it will get rid of cow dung smell. \u00b7 Azolla is green algae. It has capacity to absorb nitrogen in the air and fix it. So, it has 25 -30% proteins, 10 -15% salts and large quantity of vitamins. \u00b7 The beds should be in a tree shade. The bed length should be approximately 2 m, width should be 2 meter and depth should be 10 -15 cm. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 147 Azolla Bed Preparation - To drain the excess water from one of the corners of the bed, the height of this corner should be kept 2 cm less than the other sides. A waste plastic sheet should be spread at the bottom of the bed. So, the roots of the trees in the surrounding area will not enter the bed. Then spread a good quality plastic sheet. In the created bed, 10 -15 kgs of sieved soil should be spread on the plastic sheet evenly. Create a mixtur e of 3 kg dung and 30 gm single super phosphate in 10 litres of water and pour into this bed from all the four sides. Then pour water up to 10 cm height. Mix this mixture lightly by hand and remove the floating garbage. Fig 19 - Azolla Put 1 kg pure azolla in the bed water. Then sprinkle water on it. To prevent azolla from flowing with the water, install a net in the corner from where the excess water drains. If the bed is under the tree shade, put a plastic cover on the bed. After 15 days, 400 -500 gms/day azolla is produced. Azolla grows very fast. When the bed fills completely, we get 1 -1.5 kg/day azolla. Separate the azolla using a sieve and wash it properly and if it is fed to the cattle by mixing it with cakes in 1:1 proportion, the milk production incr eases by 10 -12% and the digestion capacity of the cattle also increases. Azolla can be fed to cattle along with concentrates and separately, too. 0.5 to 1 kg of azolla can be given to the cattle with cakes. On the first day, if azolla is removed from the bed no.1, it should be removed on exactly the day no.4 from the same bed. Mix 1 kg dung and 20 gm single super phosphate every week in this bed. It stimulates good growth of azolla. Remove half of the water from the bed every 10 days and replace it with the same quantity of fresh water. Remove 5 kg soil every 1.5 to 2 months, and put it into the new bed. Every six months, clean the whole bed and mix new azolla to it. Azolla can be given as animal feed to the cows, buffalos, pigs, and hens. Take advice from veterinary doctor before using it as a complete animal feed. Hydroponic fodder: - Use of low cost technique: - Installing racks for hydroponics fodder production. Create shelves as needed. Use drip irrigation for watering. Use shade net for keeping the rack in shade. Production process: - For fodder creation, soak corn in water for 24 hours every day. Then it is covered in a gunny bag for 36 hours for germination. This germinated corn is spread in the trays. These trays are kept in the rack. This tray has 6 to 7 small holes at the bottom. So that the excess water in the tray will be drained. Fig 20 - hydroponic fodder This is how it is produced: - In a tray of 1 X 1.5 foot approximately 450 to 500 gms of germinated corn can be spread evenly. It gives approximately 5 kg production in nine days. 2 kg germinated corn is spread in a big tray of 3 X 2 feet size. We can get production up to 20 kgs from it. From total production, up to 30 MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 148 kg fodder is available every day. For irrigation, old drip tube is used and foggers are attached to it at the distance of 1.5 to 2 feet. Drip tube is attached to a spray pump which operates on battery. If the pump is operated for maximum 4 to 5 minutes, all trays can be watered at the same time. Uromeal: -Dietitians have created animal feed by using urea, m olasses, and wheat bran. It is called as uromeal. To make this - urea, molasses should be added to water and it should be boiled to 100 \u00b0 Celsius in a pan and then it should be mixed with wheat bran. Lick - liquid feed: - Lick for animals can be created by using urea, molasses, mineral salts, salt, and vitamins. Mix 2.5 kg urea, 1 kg and 2 kg minerals salts in approximately 2.5 litres of water and create a solution. Mix this solution with a thick solution of molasses or jaggery. And add 15 gm vitamin 'A' and 'D' to it. A lick created using this method should be kept in the animals shed itself. Fodder Processing: -Cattle need to be provided with dry fodder along with green fodder. If it is not possible to provide sufficient green fodder to the cattle in summ er, it is useful to make chaff from the available dry fodder and process it, it prevents wastage of the fodder and increases digestibility and quality. In dairy farming/ animal husbandry business, most of the expenses are done for animal feed. So, it is v ery important for the dairy farmers to decrease the expenses on the fodder and feed. For that processing the low -quality fodder in low cost and using it for feeding the animals is useful. It decreases the expenses on animal feed and increases the profits o f dairy farmer. Benefits of processing the fodder: - 1. Usefulness of the fodder can be increased by 10 to 15%. 2. By making chaff of green fodder, green corn etc. the volume of the fodder decreases. So, the fodder can be used properly. It avoids wastage of feed. Makes the storage easy. The expenditure for that decreases. 3. Toxicity and unwanted ingredients of fodder can be decreased. 4. Fodder can be harvested at the right time and can be dried properly and stored. 5. The expenditure on storage and transport can be decreased. 6. Shelf life / durability can increase.

MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 150 MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 151 UNIT 4: PERSONAL HEALTH AND HYGIENE SESSION 1: BALANCED DIET Human body needs proper diet to grow and maintain itself. Have you ever thought why do we consume food? We consume food to get energy. Our body needs energy to perform its usual functions such as walking, speaking, thinking, working etc. We need adequate amount of energy to perfo rm every small day to day activity and we get this energy from the food we consume. Components of the chapter: 1. Balanced diet: definition and elements 2. Benefits of balanced diet 3. Deficiencies of balanced diet 1. Balanced diet: definition and elements The diet, which provides all the necessary elements for the nutrition of body is called balanced diet. The balanced diet includes the proper amount of all the nutrients like carbohydrate, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, water. Classification of the components of balanced diet: We can classify the elements of balanced diet into two components: \u00b7 Organic components: These components contain carbon. a) Carbohydrate b) Fat (Lipids) c) Protein d) Vitamins \u00b7 Inorganic components a) Water b) Minerals Elements of balanced diet: We will now discuss the elements of balanced diet in detail. 1. Organic components: a) Carbohydrate: Generally carbohydrates are found in plant sources. Carbohydrates are the major and most important component of our diet. Foods which is high in carbohyd rate are rice, wheat flour, jowar, potato, sabudana, ragi, green gram, Bengal gram, kidney beans, apricot, jiggery, honey, dry dates, etc. In our food we use carbohydrate in maximum amount. \u00b7 Carbohydrates are found in the form of Sugar, Starch and Cellulose in fruits, vegetables, grains and milk products. \u00b7 In green plants, carbohydrate is formed through the biochemical process of photo synthesis. \u00b7 Carbohydrate is formed by the combination of carbon and oxygen. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 152 \u00b7 In case of excess consumption of carbohydrate, th e liver converts the extra amount of carbohydrate into glycogen and stores it. \u00b7 Carbohydrates are the important source of energy for the body. 50% -75% of body energy need is provided by carbohydrates. \u00b7 Through 1 gram of carbohydrate 4 kcal of energy is obta ined. B) Proteins: We get protein from plant as well a s animal sources. Proteins perform main role in muscle development. Proteins are building blocks of the body. \u00b7 Proteins is made from amino -acid. \u00b7 Whatever protein we consume our body uses it to prepare d ifferent essential biological compounds such as enzymes, hormones, antibodies, hemoglobin etc. \u00b7 Enzymes are protein which are necessary as a catalyst for different body functions. \u00b7 Antibodies are also proteins which bind to foreign material like viruses and bacteria that enters the body and help protect the body. \u00b7 Hormones are also proteins necessary to coordinate biological processes of the body. \u00b7 Through 1 gram of protein 4 kcal of energy is obtained. c). Fats: Like proteins and carbohydrates fats are also one of the nutrients used as energy source by the body. \u00b7 Fats are made from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. \u00b7 Fats make a thin smooth layer on the body organs. \u00b7 If fat is consumed in excess it brings obesity. \u00b7 Ong gra m of Fats produces 9 calories d). Vitamins: The term Vitamin is coined by 'Funk ' in 1912. Vitamins are the substances necessary for the growth & development of the body. \u00b7 Vitamins are found only in living organisms in the form of organic compounds. \u00b7 We ne ed to take vitamins from outside the body. Our body needs 13 vitamins. \u00b7 Classification of Vitamins MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 153 \u00b7 Vitamins: Sources, functions and deficiency diseases: Fig 1 - Vitamin - Sources Function & deficiency diseases Anemia MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 154 \u00b7 Vitamin B group : The B vitamin group is consist of total eight B vitamins. They often work together in the body, each member of Fig 2 - \u00b7 Vitamin B group plays unique, specific and important functions. The chart below depicts the main functions, s ources, deficiency dise ases of B group vitamins . Fig 3 - Beriberi Fig 4 - Scurv y Fig 5 - Ricket MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 155 Fig 6 - Anemia 2) Inorganic Elements: a) Minerals: Minerals are important component of dietary nutrition. Minerals are used to control metabolic processes in the body . \u00b7 Minerals have an important role in body metabolism. \u00b7 We require minerals as an essential nutrient to perform functions necessary for life. Water: - Water is the most important component of the human diet. Water plays an impo rtant role in all the metabolic & physiological processes of the body. In human being 70% of body mass is water. \u00b7 Common minerals, their sources and the diseases which occur due to mineral deficiency: Fig 7 MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 156 \u00d8 Importance of balanced diet: 1. A balanced diet is important for healthy body. 2. Without good nutrition, our body is more suitable to disease & infection which results in poor body performance. 3. In present days our lives have become more dependent on junk foods such as burger, pizza, cold drinks, packaged food items etc. Body have difficulty in digesting them. Regular consumption of these food items results in obesity, heart diseases , and diabeties . To avoid these health problems balanced diet & exercise is necessary. 4.

For good health proper diet, dental hygiene, everyday bath, regular exercise, proper diet all are very important. In chapter 2 we will study about personal health and hygiene as well as community health and mental health in detail. Have you ever felt that when we do not get the proper sleep, then the next day our body becomes dull and uncomfort able? If we do not eat food one day or eat too much, how our body feels and reacts? How our body reacts if we do not exercise or exercise too much? We will study and discuss about the answer to these questions in the present chapter. Our actions have a dir ect impact on our body and its health. Therefore, we should discipline our body with good eating habits. Purpose of this Chapter: 1. Understanding the importance of clean and hygienic environment 2. Understanding the factors which affect good health 3. Importance of exercise For being healthy we should keep away from following things: 1. Smoking 2. Drinking alcohol 3. Addiction of any type Personal health & mental health are related to each other which also affects commun ity health. Good health can be achieved by adopting healthy lifestyle and good personal hygiene. If a person is healthy he can keep and motivate his family members and the community to adopt healthy lifestyle and be healthy.

Brushing two times daily is imperative to keep the teeth and gums healthy and free of diseases. It is necessary to scrub the tongue when brushing. 2. A daily bathing habit helps in keeping body clean, fresh and odor free. 3. Cleaning & Trimming your nails regul arly 4. Washing hands: We should wash our hands before eating food, also wash your hands after going to the bathroom and after coughing, and after handling garbage. Hygiene products, like an alcohol -based soaps or sanitizing gels should be used frequently. 5. Healthy hair: Washing your hair regularly is important for healthy hair. Fig 8 - Hand washing step 6. Healthy ear: We should regularly clean our ears. Wax has a useful role to play in the ear, it lubricates and protects the ear. Avoid hairpin or other harmful tools for ear cleaning. 7. Healthy eyes: We should regularly wash our eyes with clean water. It's important to check your eyes regularly. Avoid rubbing your eyes, washing face and eyes freq uently. You 're your ey es with cold water. Try to clean your ey es MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 159 when taking a bath. Common eye infections such as viral conjunctivitis (pink eye) can be avoided with proper hand washing. 8. Take suffi cient and quality sleep. Importance of Exercise: The regular exercise is important in our daily lives. The regular exercise helps people to reduce their risk of developing several diseases such as heart, obesity, cancer, dementia, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and Alzheimer 's etc. We should incorporate exerci se into daily schedule. Benefits of regular exercise: \u00b7 Maintain healthy body weight \u00b7 Reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure and diabetes etc. \u00b7 Reduced symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression \u00b7 Strengthens immune system \u00b7 Exercise keep bones, joints and muscles healthy. We should not exercise immediately after consuming food (our stomach should not be full). Community Health : Personal health and community health are inter related. For healthy society, it is important that people also maintains their health properly. Taking care of personal health along with the surrounding community can be called ass Community health. Communit y hygiene and cleanliness is imperative for individual as well as community health. There are few things which we should do to maintain personal and community health: \u00b7 We should always throw garbage in the dustbin and not anywhere else. \u00b7 Wet and dry waste sh ould properly be segregated and then it should be disposed in separate dustbins. \u00b7 Sewage water gutter should never be kept open and dirty water should never be thrown on roads. Personal Health Mental Health Community Health Healthy being MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 160 \u00b7 Rivers should be kept clan and garbage should never be thrown in rivers. Also, washing of dirty clothes, taking bath and bathing animals in river should not be allowed. These practices pollutes the river and makes it non -usable. \u00b7 Open defecation practices should be stopped. Some other factors that influence health: 1. Peer influence: our life is to a large degree influenced by social factors around us like the community and institutions like family and school . If the peers have a positive approach on the issue of health, we also tend to have positive outlook and it reflects in our habi ts and vice versa. For example , if one of our friend having a habit of eating junk food regularly, we are also likely to be little like him or her. In promoting healthy or unhealthy eating habits role of peers is an important factor. 2. Effect of Monetary fa ctors on health : Financial condition can have major effects on anybody 's health. Sometime financial proble ms can affect a person's health . People who are financially well can get their treatment from good hospitals but poor people cannot are not able to af ford the expensive treatment sometimes. Mental Health : - Our mental health decides our physical health . Our emotions, feelings, thoughts create a huge impact on our health. Mental health is a s tate of mind in which person realizes his inner strengths, he can handle normal stresses of life & work productively for the wellbeing of society. Mental health is closely associated with our feelings, our thoughts, our actions & how we relate to our surroundings. Some of the behaviors or signs of a mental prob lem: \u00b7 Changed sleeping habits. Either sleeping too much or too little . \u00b7 Avoiding public meetings \u00b7 Prolonged frustration \u00b7 Regular head each, irritations without reasons \u00b7 Feeling of loneliness , sadness \u00b7 Confused, worried, scared \u00b7 Always fighting with others \u00b7 Severe mood swings \u00b7 Violent actions to harm yourself or others Chart below depicts the impact of mental health condition on our life Mental instability/ illness Normal mental state Dullness, improper sleep, improper appetite Being energetic, feeling happy, proper sleep No enthusiasm Enthusiastic and eager to learn new things Tiredness, fearfulness Mental peace, stability MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 161 Lack of confidence, do not want to take responsibility Full of confidence Poor concentration Proper concentration Memory loss No patience patience CHECK YOUR PROGRESS Subjective Questions 1.

MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 162 SESSION 3: COMMUNICABLE & NON - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES , VACCINATION , DEHYDRATION AND EMERGENCY FIRST AID Disease is the condition of obstructing important biological functions in the body due to physiological obstructions or mental disorders. A dis ease is an unhealthy state when your body shows unusual symptoms. There are different types of diseases. In this chapter we will study about different diseases, their causal factors, their symptoms and r emedies to avoid them. Purpose and importance of thi s chapter 1. Study different types of human diseases 2. Study about different measures to prevent the diseases 3. Vaccination and its importance 4. To understand the reasons, symptoms and treatment of dehydration Before proceeding with this chapter further, we need to understand the meaning of some of the terms which are described below: 1.Healthy state - It can be determined by the measurement criteria; For example, natural temperature of the body, rotation of the pulse of every minute and the frequency of breathle ssness, blood pressure, weight, height etc. These criteria and their dimensions are statistical (statistical) dimensions determined by many individuals' observations. These parameters are changing according to age, gender, geographical area, climate, occup ation of business etc. 2. State of health: There are certain parameters through which the doctors measures the condition of health for anyone. Some of these parameters are natural body temperature, pulse rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, weight, heigh t, etc. All these criteria and their dimension (reading) are not rigid and it changes according to person's age, sex, geographic area, environment, profession etc. Therefore these are calculated by the experts, keeping in mind above mentioned factors. 3. Diseases: Disease is a condition of the living (animal or plant) being where one/several of its parts. There are some diseases which manifests its symptoms very soon and some diseases keep spreading inside the body and their symptoms are manifested after s everal years such as diabetes, low or high blood pressure, early stage cancer etc. Some inactive genetic diseases rests inside the body for lifelong and sometimes they manifests themselves in next generation. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 163 Reasons and signs of diseases : Diseases are caused by several factors such as place, environment, socioeconomic status, habits (such as smoking and drinking alcohol), family history, age, sex etc. There are certain occupations people working for are more prone to certain diseases e.g. diseases related to chemicals in chemical industry. Person 's diet, nature, the individual hygiene, community hygiene are the factors affecting the health status. \u00d8 Some of the reasons of diseases: \u00b7 Improper/ imbalanced diet \u00b7 Change in environment/ irregularity in atmosphere \u00b7 Mechanical factors: accident, fall, injury \u00b7 Improper functioning of body organs \u00b7 Pollution \u00b7 Mental illness/imbalance \u00d8 Infection through food Consuming contaminated foods, water or b everages results in food born diseases. Some of the reasons of infection are: 1. Food: consumption of open and contaminated food 2. Hand and nails: Dirty hands and unclean nails 3. Contact with faces , Urine: Consumption of food/water contaminated with faces /urine. Not properly cleaning hands after defecation/ urination 4. Harmful creatures: Infection through insects/rodents/other creatures such as cockroaches, rats, spiders etc. 5. Infected utensils/ equipment/things: Infection through dirty utensils, towels, handles, kitchen equipment (mixer, juicer, toaster etc.), taps, doors etc. \u00d8 Reasons of food infection: - Food is infected by pathogenic bacteria, parasites, viruses that contaminate food through contact with dirty hands, contact with faces/urine, dust etc. Improper/ Imbalanced diet Not feeling hungry Reduced Weight Loss Reduced Immunity Diseases MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 164 \u00d8 Classification of diseases There ar e several types of diseases. A disease can be categorized as one type or another depending on certain factors involved in its development. Diseases contracted through air (Airborne): These are the diseases transmitted through the air. Diseases contracted through food (Foodborne) Spread through consumption of contaminated food. Diseases related to Lifestyle These are the d isease s which are generated through behavioral choices e.g. sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy foods, alcohol consumption , too much fat consumption etc . Generally we classify the diseases in two major types: communicable and non-communicable diseases. 1. Infectious diseases or communicable diseases: Communicable diseases are infectious. Infectious diseases contaminate from one person to person . 2. Non-communicable: - These are non -infecti ous diseases. Some of the examples are heart disease and cancer. 1. Communicable diseases or infectious diseases: Some Disease causing micro -organisms like bacteria, virus, and parasite are responsible for infectious diseases. These diseases can be spread fr om person to person directly or indirectly. W e will study about infectious diseases caused by bacteria and viruses in detail. Diseases caused by Bacteria: Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that generally affects the lungs. TB is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacteriu m tuberculosis . The TB causative bacteria is airborne, which can spread through the air. Symptoms: \u00b7 Cough for more than 3 weeks \u00b7 Fever \u00b7 Weight loss \u00b7 Night sweats \u00b7 Weakness TB prevention and treatment \u00b7 Prevention is necessary to control the spread of the bacteria . BCG vaccine is used to prevent the disease. \u00b7 Education awareness about TB not only to people who already ha ve the disease but also to general public. \u00b7 Respiratory hygiene - To prevent the spread of disease it is necessary to cover the nose & mouth while coughing or sneezing \u00b7 Avoid roadside spitting. \u00b7 DOTS: - DOTS or Directly Observed Treatment short course is the internationally accepted treatment for TB control. From 1997 the DOTS program is implementing in India. In DOTs treatment patient is under direct observation of health professional. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 165 Typhoid: - Typhoid is a disease caused by the bacteria Salmonella Typhi. These bacteria 's spread through direct contamination with the feces of affected person. Highest chances of contamination is through water & food . Symptoms of typhoid \u00b7 Fever and rash. \u00b7 Slowly increasing fever \u00b7 Body weakness, \u00b7 abdominal pain, \u00b7 constipation, \u00b7 headaches \u00b7 Sometimes diarrhea, and vomiting. Prevention and treatment: \u00b7 Drink purified clean water. \u00b7 Avoid street food \u00b7 Typhoid vaccine -it provides protection from typhoid up to three years. \u00b7 Wash your hands before eating or preparing food and also after using the toilet. Diseases caused by Viruses: a) Hepatitis: Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Majorly ther e are 5 hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis A, B and C are infectious. Hepatitis is the most prevalent and serious psychiatric disease in India. Hepatitis A and E are caused by contaminated food or water. Types B and C are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and can cer. Symptoms: \u00b7 jaundice (yellowing of the skin, eyes), \u00b7 dark urine, \u00b7 extreme fatigue, \u00b7 Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Prevention and treatment: \u00b7 We can prevent Hepatitis A and B through vaccination but there is no vaccine available for hepatitis C a nd E. \u00b7 It is very necessary to clean hands after using toilet to prevent hepatitis from spreading. \u00b7 Test of hepatitis B and C is necessary before donating or receiving blood. b) Rabies: It is a viral disease in mammals and Rabies is transmitted through the bite of domestic an imals such as dog, cat, and wild animals like foxes, skunks, raccoons, monkeys, cattle's and bats etc. The rabies virus affects the central nervous system . MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 166 Symptoms: \u00b7 Often symptoms increase after 10 days of infection. There are two sta ges of growth of symptoms. Headache, fever, appetite, irritability or pain on the wound. After 2 to 10 days, signs of harm to the nervous system are visible . \u00b7 Loss of vision and paralysis, hyper salivation, sudden abnormalities of throat swallowing, water disruption and obstruction of swelling. A sudden death can be caused by a stroke or heart attack. Prevention and treatment: \u00b7 Medical help should get immediately. \u00b7 Vaccination of pets. \u00b7 One of the most important preventive measures is to clean the wound with soap and water. c) Polio: You may feel sorry for the disabled, crooked children. Have you ever noticed their status? Do they have a disability? The answer is 'no'. Do they have a disability from birth? The answer is 'no'. The disease that has permanently disabled them is Polio. It is a disease caused by virus which attacks nervous system. This virus is highly contagious. Children younger than 5years are highly suscepti ble to polio virus infection. Symptoms \u00b7 Most of the time there are no visible symptoms. \u00b7 Very few times it shows flu-like symptoms (Sore throat, Fever, Tiredness, Nausea, Headache, Stomach pain). \u00b7 Paralysis can lead to permanent disability Prevention and treatment \u00b7 Children should get vaccinated as per the vaccination schedule. Pulse polio: \u00b7 Pulse Polio is an initiative taken by government for elimination of polio virus by vaccinating the children under the age of five. \u00b7 India is a polio free country. \u00b7 This program provides polio safety not only to the immunized child but also to the community in the surrounding. d). AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome): HIV is human immune deficiency virus. HIV is causative organism of aids. Once infected, human body canno t throw out the virus even with treatment. So once someone gets infected with HIV they carry this virus forever life. Acquired: To get something from someone else. Immunodeficiency -Low immune response from body Syndrome: Body shows symptoms of many diseases at a time. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 167 Symptoms of HIV infection - Many people don't show any symptoms for several months of infection. Some people shows following sympto ms after 2 -6 weeks of infection - \u00b7 fever \u00b7 chills \u00b7 joint pain \u00b7 muscle aches \u00b7 sore throat \u00b7 sweats \u00b7 a red ras h \u00b7 tiredness \u00b7 weakness \u00b7 weight loss Fig 9 - HIV virus Infection from HIV: \u00b7 Unsafe sex with an infected person. Infected blood transfusion. People who use drugs often use each other's needles. This causes HIV to be transmitted from one person to another. HIV can be transmitted to the baby from the infected mother. Prevention and treatment: \u00b7 Health education \u00b7 ELISA test is the only reliable test for the detection of HIV/AIDS. \u00b7 Avoid using common toothbrush . \u00b7 HIV test before bloo d donation s \u00b7 Avoid unprotected sex. \u00b7 Proper disposal of needles & syringes after use , do not use it again. 2. Non-communicable Diseases: Diseases which are noninfectious are called as non -communicable diseases. Cannot spread from one person to other person. 1. Cancer: This is the condition in which cells of body grows abnormally. Uncontrolled growth of body cells develops tumor. Tumors are of two types: Cell division uncontrolled growth Healthy cells Fig 10 - Cell division MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 168 1. Benign Tumor: If the tumor is not spreading any other part of the body then it is benign. 2. Malignant tumor: If the tumor is spreading to any other part of the body then it is Malignant . 3. Carcinogens are substances that are responsible for promoting or generating cancer. Tobacco, arseni c, radiation of gamma & X ray, asbestos, etc. are some examples of carcinogens. Signs and Symptoms: \u00b7 Tumors or lumps in any part of the body. \u00b7 Appearance of w hite patches inside the mouth \u00b7 change in bowel or bladder function, \u00b7 unusual bleeding \u00b7 persistent cough Diagnosis and treatment: \u00b7 Stage and type of Cancer is also determined by biopsy test result. \u00b7 Treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. 4. Diabetes: - Diabetes is a disease in which person suffers blood glucose fluctuations. It is a metabolism disorder. In the process of metabolism food consumed by us get converted in to glucose. Our body uses this glucose as a source of energy . Pancreas releases a hormone called insulin . Insulin regulates the blood glucose level. Diabetic p atient shows high level of blood glucose because of improper functioning of insulin. In diabetic condition body either produce insufficient amount of insulin or there is complete lack of insulin. This results in too high level of blood glucose. Body releas es extra sugar through urine which results in lack of important energy requirements in body. Symptoms: \u00b7 frequent urination, \u00b7 Intense thirst and hunger, \u00b7 weight gain, unusual weight loss, \u00b7 Dizziness \u00b7 Difficulty in healing wounds , \u00b7 Tingling in hands and feet. Reasons of diabetes: Causes of diabetes: Bad diet and lifestyle habits like consumption of high -sugar foods Intake of sweetened tea, milk, etc. Cold drinks and other soft drinks Overweight/obesity Physical inactivity Smoking and Tobacco consumption MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 169 Heredity Stress Treatment: Dietary changes - minimize consumption of sugar . Increased intake of wheat flour and green vegetables Reduce the intake of ghee, oil and fried foods Small meals at regular interval Avoiding high carbohy drate fruits Avoid stress Measures to keep diabetes in control: Take medicine regularly Checking blood sugar level periodically Regular yoga and exercise Consumption of bitter gourd juice Other diseases that come with diabetes: Visual impairments, high blood pressure, heart disease, Paralysis, mental illness, blindness, and cataract. Immunity and Personal Health The health & hygiene of a person is the foundation of social and public cleanliness. Where public cleanliness is not maintained, micro -organisms are easily reaped. The person should adopt the following measures for his personal health and public health. 1. Balanced and Nutritious Diet - We should adopt a diet that is nutritious and balanced and protein rich. This will strengthen our immune system. 2. Regular Exercise - Regular yoga and exercise keeps our body healthy and increases immune power. 3. Personal Hygiene - Personal hygiene practices like regular cleaning of teeth, bathing, washing hands before eating , cover mouth with napkin while sneezing or coughing are important to prevent spread of diseases. The use of tobacco , alcohol, cigarettes, etc. is very harmful from the perspective of personal and social health. Uncovered food or fast food etc. should not be consumed. Get adequate sleep and drink plenty of water. If a disease strikes, it should be treated at an early stage, so that the disease does not spread. Importance of Vaccination - Vaccination is an important preventive action against infect ious diseases which creates resistance to disease causing organism. In this process, attenuated (weakened) viruses are transferred into a person 's/child body through vaccine. Vaccines stimulate the immune system of the body. Considering the fact that many diseases like Influenz a, small pox, hepatitis, swine flu, etc. can be prevented with just a few shots and drops of vaccines, Government has been providing many vaccines absolutely free of cost in government hospitals. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 170 Many diseas es have been eliminated from the world because o f proper and effective vaccination programs. Edward Jenner, first discovered the vaccine in the year 1796. This vaccine was small pox. Vaccination is important for the following reasons - \u00b7 Prevention of bacteria/viruses that cause diseases. \u00b7 Bacteria/virus that cause diseases, they are eliminated from continuous immunization. Thus, the spreading of disease stops altogether. For example: Polio. \u00b7 Vaccination increases the strength of immune system and the reby helps to avoid many diseases. \u00b7 Along with regular hea lthy diet, exercise, regular health check -up, vaccination is also very important to keep the body safe from diseases and to fight diseases. \u00b7 In the absence of immunization, especially children and elderly are easily preyed by many deadly diseases. \u00b7 Immunization provides protection against serious diseases like swine flu, hepatitis, plague, etc. Dehydration Dehydration is excessive loss of water from your body. It is very important to maintain the level of water in the body. Dehydration affects health. Dehydration of severe forms can be life threatening. Causes: Diarrhea, vomiting, Fever Excessive sweating - While sweating y ou lo se water . Excessive bleeding due to accident result in shortage of water in the body and can cause dehydration. High dosage of tablets Symptoms: Nervousness Dry mouth and tongue Extreme thirst Fatigue Dizziness Confusion Weakness Headache Muscle cramps Very dry skin Fainting Fig 11 - ORS formula Thirst , and irritability , headache Excessive loss of water can also results in death & hypovolemic shock (loss of blood volume). MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 171 Treatment: Drink adequate amount of water Avoid intake of tea, coffee, milk or fruit juice Drink fluids that contain electrolytes If your dehydration is serious, you may need to see a doctor Drinking ORS Oral Rehydration Solution will help you to re -establish the balance of body fluids. The solution of sugar and salt is also helpful. Method to prepare rehydr ation solution at home: 1 glass boiled water + \u00bd spoon of salt + 1 spoon of sugar First Aid When a person is injured or suddenly becomes ill, there is a time to give pre - treatment. First aid is the first treatment for any injury, accidents, and illness. Collection of medical equipments, medicines which are necessary for giving medical treatment i s called as a first aid kit. Some things to keep in mind: Stay calm and give emotional support to the patient Do not give any drink to u nconscious patients. Drinks can cause th e airway to block. Do not wake the unconscious person by shaking him. First Aid Kit Make sure you have the first aid material in your home. Keep some simple medicines in it. Keep primary aids and medicines away from children. Keep a list of prescription medicines and their use A First Aid Kit should have the following contents: 2-3 Band -Aids of different size Plastic non -latex gloves (at least 2 pairs) Tweezers Sharp scissors Safety pins Bandages of gauze or cloth Soap Thermometer Petroleum jelly Aloe Vera gel Glucose powder Syringe Fig 12 - First Aid Kit Cotton ORS (Oral Rehydration Salt) Small torch Antibiotic ointment Antiseptic solution MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 172 Essential medications for first aid: Painkillers like Aspirin Antihistamine cream for bee sting or insect bite Anti-diarrhea medication Antacid for stomach ache Antiseptic cream like Soframycin to apply on wounds Calpol, avomine, paracetamol, aspirin, crocin We need to store all the material in a cle an, durable and water -proof box . If any medicine in the box gets expired, it should b e changed immediately. Essential techniques for first aid: 1. Snake Bite Giving first aid treatment within 10 minutes of the poisonous snake bite can save the person. About 15 cm from the bite, tie up a cloth well so that the poison does not rise above. On the advice of a trained doctor, the anti -venom serum injection should be given. 2. Scorpion Sting Pain of Scorpion stings persist for several hour's results in local redness and numbness . Wash the injured site and apply potassium permanganate. Give pain killers such as paracetamol. Alum dissolved in water can also be applied on the affected area. Seek medical help. 3. Wound You can stop bleeding by applying slight pressure on the wound with a clean cloth or tissue . 4. Bone Fracture Apply ice packs t o the inj ured area to control swelling and pain. Call for medical help. 5. Electric shock and Heart attack Check for a person 's breathing pace. If necessary provide artificial respiration. It should be done only by a trained person. Call for medical help. 6. Ingestion of toxic substance Induce vomiting (give salty water or putting a finger in the throat). Administering atropine injection in case of insecticide. 7. Diarrhea or Heatstroke Giving ORS.Administering saline. 8. High fever Keep wet napkin on the f orehead. CHECK YOUR PROGRESS Subjective Questions 1. Explain the use of first aid kit in emergency 2.

MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 174 SESSION 4: BLOOD & BLOOD GROUP -BASIC AND MEASURING BLOOD PRESSURE & BLOOD HEMOGLOBIN Role of Blood is important in proper functioning of body mechanism. It carries nutrient & oxygen to the body ce lls & transports waste material away from the cell. Blood is circulated through blood vessels called arteries & vein. Arteries carry oxygenated blood while veins carry deoxygenated blood . The heart sends deoxygenated blood carried from veins to the lungs & lungs pump the oxygenated blood to the heart. In this chapter you wi ll read about the basic components of blood, blood pressure, measurement of blood pressure, hemoglobin in the blood, blood group and methods of blood group testing. Objective - 1. To study the identification of blood group. 2. To study the importance of hemoglobin. 3. The importance of blood pressure and the method of measuring blood pressure. 4. To study the method of measuring hemoglobin. Method of testing of blood group - (Students need to observe the practical - Demonstra tion should be given by teacher only) Blood cannot be artificially prepared. Blood of all individuals is red in color, but everyone has the different blood group. Knowing about your blood group is very important. Earlier, only photographs, names etc. wer e required for identity card, but now with these things, our blood group is also written on the identity card. Someone's blood group can never be changed. It is extremely important to know your blood group in the event of casualty, surgical procedures and emergencies. Pre-preparation to check blood group - 1. Lancet 2. Table, chair 3. Keep the contents of blood test ready - (blood group kit, lancet, glass slide, spirit, cotton) Components of blood - Blood is a biological fluid, its main components are - 1. Red blood cell (erythrocytes) 2. White blood cell (leukocytes) 3. Platelets (thrombocytes) Fig 13 - Type of Blood cells Blood contains the following substances: 1. Plasma which contains 90% of the water, through which transport of organic and non-organic materials takes place 2. Soluble substances - proteins, nutrients, hormones, enzymes, waste materials MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 175 3. Blood cells - red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes 4. Protein - Serum Albumin, Serum Globulin, Fibrinogen 5. Nutrients - Glucos e, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, salt 6. Hormones and enzymes. 7. Waste materials - urea, Co2. Types of Blood Particles - A) Red blood corpuscles (RBC) Oval, biconcave shape, diameter - 7.2 m Red blood cells are red due to hemoglobin. Hemoglobin consist of iron and globin (a type of protein). It is the carrier of oxygen to the cells. There is no nucleus in the RBC cell, hence there is no division of RBC cell. A normal RBC count for adult human being is 5 and 4.5 million RBCs per cubic milli meter of blood. RBCs are produced by bone marrow. B) White blood corpuscles (WBC) Irregular shape - WBC can change its shape.. WBC size is larger than RBC diameter 10 micron | There are nucleus in these cells, so they are capable of dividing. Ratio - for 1 cu mm (1 mm3) around 8 thousand in blood. Formation - bone marrow, spleen Function - destroying pathogenic microorganisms inside the body. WBCs are also called \"soldiers of the body\" C) Thrombocytes (Platelets) Diameter - About 3 microns, flattened and colorless Quantity - about 2 to 3 million in one cubic meter blood Work - Supporting blood fractures platelets Platelets work with proteins of blood fluids to help in the blood cloting at the place of the wound. Blood group e xamination - Students need to observe the practical - Demonstration should be given by teacher only) To check the blood group, Place (Anti-A, Anti B and Anti-D) all three elements on the table and then blood drops on the glass slide. Antigen - Anti means anti-reaction and Gen means, to build. Antig en is a protein which helps the production of antibodies in the body. Each individual have specific antigen on their blood cell. Body produces antibodies against the antigen which is not similar to blood antigen. A body creates a new substance to destroy the unknown antigen in the blood, called an antibody. 'A' antigen is found on the RBC of a person with 'A' blood group and B antibody in their plasma. 'B' antigen is fou nd on the RBC of a person with 'B' blood group and 'A' antibody in their plasma. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 176 Person with AB blood group have both A & B antigens on their RBC , thus Person with AB blood group does not have any antibodies in their blood plasma. The person with blood group O does not have any antigens on the RBC , therefore in their plasma both A and B antibodies are found. Blood group - Blood groups are A, B, AB or O type. And each blood group is either RH positive or RH negative. The blood grou p is told by combining these two types such as A + ve, B + ve, AB -ve, O + ve etc. What does the Rh factor mean? Rh factor is a protein/ antigen present on the surface of RBC, which is called as antigen 'D'. It was discovered in the blood of Rhesus monkey s. A person having this antigen 'D' (also called Rh factor) are called Rh positive (Rh+). Others who do not have antigen D are known as Rh negative (Rh -). Rh negative person form antibodies against Rh factor if he receives the blood with Rh factor and des troys the donor's blood cells. This process causes the transfusion reaction. That is why Rh negative person cannot receive the blood of an Rh positive person. Blood Donation and Useful Information - The entire blood or its components are offered to a pati ent in accordance with their needs. Thus the blood donated by a donor can be used for different patients by separating their components. In the human body, all red blood cells, 60 -70% white blood cells and all platelets are formed in the Bone marrow. White blood cells form antibodies against the harmful external elements for the body, therefore white blood cells are vital for the body's immunity. The important function of platelets is to make blood clots and prevent bleeding. Therefore, RBC , WABC & platelets are offered in the body according to the needs of the patient. How the blood flowing through our wounds coagulates? - The blood platelets release thromboplastin which plays as important role in clotting of blood results in healing of wounds. The donor and receptor's blood group compatibilities are given below: Donor Blood Group Blood Type of Recipient O A B AB O A B AB Universal Donor (Blood Group) - MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 177 Person with 'O' blood group can donate his blood be to any other blood group. The person with 'O' blood group is the universal donor. Universal Accepter (Blood group) - Person with AB blood group can take blood from any blood group. Hence this group is called universal accepter bloo d group. The following table shows the potential of the blood group of the child according to the blood group of the parents: Parent 's Blood Types Possible Children A\u00d7A A, O A\u00d7B A, B, AB, O A\u00d7AB A, B, AB A\u00d7O A, O B\u00d7B B, O B\u00d7AB A, B, AB B\u00d7O B, O O\u00d7O O O\u00d7AB A, B AB\u00d7AB A, B, AB Blood Group Testing - Students need to observe the practical - Demonstration should be given by teacher only) Purpose - Understanding the various blood groups practically by doing a blood group test. Expected Skills - Determining the blood group of the sample blood Materials and Chemicals - Lancet, cotton, 2 -3 glass slides, microscope, spirit. Method - 1. Apply the spirit on the finger of the person whose blood group is to be found. Then draw the blood with the hel p of lancet and put the blood on a clean glass slide. 2. Put a 3 drops of blood on the glass slide. Insert one drop of Antiserum A, Antiserum B and Antiserum D each on different drops. 3. Now you will combine blood drops with these anti drops. To make the mix, use three different clean glass slides. Observation and estimation - The place where blood clots are prepared on the glass slide can be seen well by the microscope and determine the blood group with the help of the following table: If your blood cells stick together when mixed with: MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 178 If your blood cells coagulate when mixed with Anti -A serum, you have type A blood If your blood cells coagulate when mixed with Anti -B serum, you have type B blood If your blood cells coagulate when mixed w ith Both anti -A and anti -B serums, you have type AB blood If your blood cells do not coagulate when anti -A and anti -B are added, you have type O blood. Human beings have a closed circulatory system. Closed circulatory systems have the blood closed insid e the arteries, capillaries and veins. Blood pressure of the human body is a scientific process and is linked to the life style of every person. We can keep the blood pressure in control through balanced diet, exercise and healthy lifestyle. Our blood pres sure increases on every beating of the heart and decreases between the two beats of the heart. The method of measurement of blood pressure - Blood pressure should be properly measured in our body. Modern instruments are available for measuring blood press ure, and nowadays blood pressure is also measured through the digital device. BP is measuring instrument is called as Sphygmomanometer. 3 types of blood pressure measurement devices are used - Traditional blood pressure measurement equipment with mercur y (simple mercury sphygmomanometer) Aneroid sphygmomanometer (without mercury and Air) Digital Sphygmomanometers - These devices show a direct computation of blood pressure. Method of measuring blood pressure using a blood pressure measuring instrument - Essential Equipment: Blood pressure measurement device, Stethoscope, Soap for hand wash \u00b7 Wrap the cuff around the upper arm. Wrist watch should be removed. \u00b7 The patient should be seated by resting the arm on a pillow. Cuff 's lower edge 2-3 inch above the lower arm. \u00b7 A stethoscope is placed below the cuff, with the help of a stethoscope identify the main artery of the arm. Lightly press the stethoscope 's bell. \u00b7 Increased air into the cuff increases the p ressure around the arm . \u00b7 Observers the pulse sounds ti ll the blood flow stops . \u00b7 Release the air pressure by deflating the cuff. \u00b7 Record the systolic pressure. (The point at which the blood fl ow is restored) The reading shows the maximum output pressure generated by the heart while it 's pumping. \u00b7 Deflate the cuff; the pulse sounds disappears completely around the maximum deflation . This is recorded as the diastolic pressure. The reading shows the pressure in the circularly system when the heart is relaxing. Method of measuring hemoglobin - Hemoglobin is an im portant component of blood. Due to hemoglobin, the blood color is red. Hemoglobin is found in RBC 's. Hb binds with oxygen. It is oxygen MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 179 carrying molecule of RBC. Deficiency of Hb causes anemia. Due to lack of hemoglobin in the blood, oxygen is not adequate ly available to the cells, resulting in the possibility of many types of diseases in the body. Reasons for lack of hemoglobin - 1. Bleeding caused by accident or surgery, or bleeding due to rectal cancer. 2. Inadequate diet, lack of nutrients, iron defici ency in diet, lack of vitamin B12, folic acid etc. The method of hemoglobin testing - Students need to observe the practical - Demonstration should be given by teacher only) Expected Skills - 1. Teaching students how to take blood samples. 2. Correct way of taking blood in the pipette. 3. Checking the quantity of hemoglobin in given sample. Hematic acid is produced due to reaction of HCL with the iron particles present in hemoglobin. The color of hematic acid is brilliant brown. The intensity of this color depends on the existing amount of HB in the blood. This fluid (hematic) is diluted by a dding water to it until its color matches with that of the comparator glass (available in the equipment). There are% HB markings on the comparator glass tube. We can take% HB reading on the tube. The quantity of HB can be read directly from this water. Equipment required - Hemocytometer which consists of a comparator box which has brown colored glass on either side Hb pipette, Dropper, Brush, Lancet, Cotton, Spirit Procedure 1. Add HCL into the tube (mark 20 \u00b5L) 2. Take the blood from the finger u sing lancet and add 0.02ml blood in the pipette. 3. Fill the blood into the HCL tube & mix it with the acid thoroughly. 4. Allow to stand still for 10min. 5. Place the hemoglobin meter in the comparator and add drop by drop distilled water to the soluti on. Stir the solution . Observe the color matches with that of the comparator glass. 6. Take the final reading by noting the height of the diluted acid hematic. Express the final reading in g%. Observation and estimation - Inspect the amount of distilled water that was required in the test tube and observe the extent to which this quantity is reached in the test tube. Precautions to be used during hemoglobin investigation - 1. Make sure that no air bubbles enter into the pipette. After this, immediately add the blood from the pipette in the test tube containing the HCL. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 180 2. To avoid any misunderstanding, it is important to explain to the person the amount of blood that is being taken for the test, how much time it will take in the test, and so on. 3. At t he place of blood removal, apply a little band aid to avoid the infection. Effect of low hemoglobin in the blood - Hemoglobin carries blood oxygen to the body tissues & transports CO2 from tissues back to the lungs. Thus Hb is oxygen carrying protein in the blood. Decreased amount of Hb results in deficiency of oxygen also affects release of CO2 from the tissues. As a result people suffer from fatigue, weakened immune power, vision problems, anemia, etc. to avoid these health problems , it is necessary to maintain the normal levels of Hb. Normal range of Hemoglobin in Male and Female: Male 13.8-17.2 gram per deciliter (g/dl) Female 12.2-15.1 gram per deciliter (g/dl) Measures to maintain the right amount of hemoglobin in blood: Eating green vegetables, jiggery, iron supplements, etc. Symptoms of hemoglobin deficiency in the body - 1. Skin looks pale, fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness etc. 2. After giving antibiotics or anthelmintic medicines, iron rich foods must be eaten. 3. The amount of hemoglobin is expressed in the unit of g / dl in the hemoglobin tests report. CHECK YOUR PROGRESS Fill in the Blanks 1. Blood is red due to the presence of ......... .. 2.

Some basic services of the government are employed to meet the health needs of the people. This chapter deals with various services that are provided by the government to help the needy and handicapped people. The basic needs of edu cation, health, hygiene, nutritious diet, water availability, availability of employment etc. are necessary for the people of all levels to live a good and qualitative life. The health of the person, the education he receives, his skill, the strength to do his labor, all these things play an important role in his economic and social development. In the absence of the capabilities mentioned above, it is necessary to provide them the economic and social support. Persons with special needs consists mainly of p hysically and mentally challenged people, tribal people, elderly, minor children of poor families and pregnant women. These are included in the underprivileged components of a society with special needs. In this chapter, we are going to study about the pro blem and need of these deprived components. Objective - 1. Students will study the basic needs of physically & mentally disabled, people suffering from natural adversities, the elderly. 2. Students will be able to calculate the health expenses of family. The nature of the disability - The well -being of the disabled can be achieved by providing protection to them and providing them with equal participation. Medical meaning of disability is physical weakness i.e. physical limb weakening, not functioning. D isability means to be deprived of participating in social life like all ordinary people. Social situations are often unfavorable to the person with disabilities, but their participation needs to be received in all areas for their development. The problems of people with disabilities - We are going to discuss the two main questions related to people with disabilities. Equal educational rights and facilities are the basic rights of a handicapped person. The second question is about availability of jobs. Univ ersalization of education, skill, knowledgeable education, vocational education, specialization - based teaching etc. Education concept are essential to be executed for the disabled. Here the question arises that is it possible to provide education to the crippled persons with the same general method? Classification of Persons with Disabilities - 1. Blind person MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 183 2. Dumb person 3. Deaf person 4. Unstable person 5. Mentally ill person 6. Multi -disabled person (person with multiple disabilities) What are the ways in which different kind of disabled persons can be educated according to their subclass? After considering at the government level, the issues of educational problems in the context of the people with disabilities, the international stand ards have been prepared to get them the right to education. Facilities needed for disabled people - 1. In order to achieve the educational development of disabled children special training, rehabilitation facilities, etc. should be provided. 2. It is impo rtant to include children with disabilities in integrated and inclusive education along with others. 3. Disabilities need to be included in the education system being available to the general. 4. Students with disabilities should get supportive materials. 5. Special school should be provided for the disabled children who cannot get education in general school because of extreme acute disability. 6. Whether the disability is physical or mental, it is extremely difficult to get employment for them, therefore it is necessary to provide employment education for disabled people. 7. Special employment should be created for disabled people in the public service plan, various public sector undertakings, government jobs etc. 8. Through the skill developmen t program, it is important to provide financial assistance to the disabled for launching small scale industries. About the education, employment and training of persons with disabilities - Governments have provided following basic facilities for the overal l development of persons with disabilities. Eg. National Awards for People with Disabilities, Vocational training & Rehabilitation Centre for person with disabilities, giving incentives to employers for providing employment opportunities for disabled perso ns. Blindness: - These are visually impaired individuals either born with vision loss or develop visual difficulties later in life. There are special schools for blind students. Blind people can learn with help of touch knowledge using braille script. Yo u can plan common reading activities with blind students so that you can discuss the study points with them; this discussion can help you to understand the needs of blind student. We need to visit the exhibitions of products created by blind students in our surroundings. These exhibitions are providing good employment opportunities to them. We can donate our eyes after death. It is a voluntary act . National Program for Control of Blindness: This Program was launched with the goal to reduce the occurrence and extent of blindness. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 184 Some of the objectives of this program is: \u00b7 Prevention of visual impairment by providing quality eye care services. \u00b7 To increase community awareness on eye care and applying preventive measures. \u00b7 Increase research opportunities for visual impairment. \u00b7 Cataract surgery \u00b7 Provide access to eye treatment and eye glasses to the patients who are below the poverty line in the government district hospitals. \u00b7 Promoting eye donation \u00b7 Collection of donated eyes in eye bank for transplant \u00b7 Eye testing and provision of eye glasses for school students Welfare of Aged people - Person who has attained the age of sixty years or above can be called as senior citizen. There is inc reasing concern towards nuclear family set -up and due to this the helplessness of old age people is rapidly increasing. Elderly people are suffering abuse & neglect both within the family & outside. The traditional values are depleting. Government has la unched several schemes and programs for the care and welfare of elderly, but these are not properly implemented. Some of the major problems with elderly people are: 1. Failing Health: The aging is identical with poor and failing health. In our country the he alth problems of elderly becomes more complicated due to lack of good quality age specific health care programs. 2. Economic Insecurity : Most of the time the elderly people are financially dependent. 3. Isolation, neglect, mental abuse, fear these are the problems of old age people. Government schemes for elderly: For the protection of elderly and to provide them with quality life, government has started several schemes. Some of these schemes are: 1. Indira Gandhi national old age pension scheme 2. Indira Gandhi Widow pension scheme 3. Indira Gandhi national disability pension scheme. 4. These schemes are government funded and are rum by local panchayat and municipalities. Some of the measures we can adopt for the welfare of elderly people: \u00b7 Many eld erly can be trained to carry out productive activities that would be useful to them or benefit their families. This will meaningfully occupy them and they can keep their boredom away. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 185 \u00b7 Counsel families, sensitize communities these are some actions needs to be taken to provide mental support to the old age people. \u00b7 Planning some activities of their interest which involves their time & skills helps to inculcate a feeling of inclusion. \u00b7 Rehabilitation, community or home based disability support should also be provided through government. Needs of Mentally disabled people: As our body get sick and we have ailments, our brain & mind is also prone to sickness and illness. Changes in normal behavior & emotions indicates the symptoms of mental illness. Mental illness is treatable. Government has implement several programs/actions for the welfare of mentally disabled people. Based on severity of the mental problem there are different categories of mentally disabled people . \u00b7 It is needed to create awareness of mental problems. This will also ensure reducing the superstitions prevailing in the society about mental problems. \u00b7 Other than medicines sometimes yoga, meditation, counseling, therapy etc. also helps up to a larger extent in reducing the mental ailments. Natural disasters and people in need: Natural disaster s are unforeseen and immediate. C yclones, earthquakes, floods, drought, heat and cold waves, landslides, avalanches, thunder\u00adstorms, etc. These are some examples of natural disasters which causes a great loss of life and property. Uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources have brought our eco system to imbalance and that is the major reason of disasters. Help needed during natural disaste rs: \u00b7 Early warning system is an effective technique to forecast the disaster which will help to prepare for the disaster and reduce the magnitude of problem. \u00b7 Government funding and relief efforts can only go so far without the help of the pub lic. Volunteers are necessary for post disaster work like, provide help to remove debris from affected sites, talk to and answer questions with disaster survivors, arranging food & basic needs for survivors etc. Earthquake: The science of earthquake pred iction is not developed and it is still not possible to predict an earthquake. A quake 's magnitude is usually measured in terms of the Richter scale. Precautions and readiness: \u00b7 Earthquake resistant buildings in susceptible areas \u00b7 Use of Richter scale to un derstand the magnitude MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 186 \u00b7 Training of people in earthquake susceptible areas about how to protect themselves during earthquakes . Emergency relief after Earthquake: \u00b7 Listen to the radio or television for information from authorities. Follow their instructions \u00b7 If home is unsafe, do not enter. \u00b7 Keep Law and order \u00b7 Transferring people to safe place \u00b7 Removal of dead bodies \u00b7 Providing medical assistance to the injured \u00b7 Console and counsel people \u00b7 Rehabilitation \u00b7 Providing immediate access to food and water \u00b7 Preparing pr oposal to rebuild the houses \u00b7 Detailed study of the loss Family Budget maintenance for being healthy - The Family budget items generally include housing, food, child care, transportation, and other necessities. It is important that every member of the family should be healthy. To achieve a good health for every member it is necessary that the family should spend a proper amount of its budget in healthy and nutritious food products and on healthy choices. Nutritious diet: Many families/people eat food whi ch is low in nutritious products such as proteins, minerals and vitamins. There are several reasons for it. One of the reason is non -affordability of such food as such nutritious diet is generally expensive. Sometimes people have money but they are ignoran t about the health benefits of such nutritious and balanced diet. Some people don 't like to eat such food instead they like to have spicy and oily food. But it is not at all necessary that nutritious products are only and always available in expensive food products. Rather they are available in easily affordable food products. We can be healthy by eating green vegetables, pulses, wheat, bajra -jowari roti, yogurt, curd, ghee and milk. By eating low -quality of foods such as peanuts, jiggery the body gets plen ty of nutritious elements. We can be healthy by eating above mentioned homemade food items which are rich in all types of nutrients and it is really not necessary to spend heavy amount of expensive food products. Other than this if we compare the expendit ure on medical needs with expenditure on nutritious food products we will find that if we eat nutritious food products our medical bill will reduce upto a greater extent. Family good health = Green card; Less illness, less medical expenditure Ill family he alth = red card; More illness, the more medical expenses \u00d8 For better family heath theses food products should be frequently used: Rice, wheat, jowar, bajri, corn MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 187 \u00d8 It is needed to provide more protein rich diet to the children of growing age: \u00b7 Vegetarians: pulses, peas, peanuts \u00b7 Non-vegetarian: Egg, chicken, mutton We should properly any food before consuming. Soyabean is full of protein therefore it should be used largely. Peanut oil should be mixed in grains to enrich it with nutrients. \u00b7 Grains: Instead of e ating only single grain we should eat different types of gains. By doing this body gets several nutrients. \u00b7 Green vegetables: they are full of irons and vitamins. \u00b7 Use of iron utensil: By using iron utensil we can increase the iron content in our food.

MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 188 SESSION 6: POLLUTION - SOURCES, EFFECTS AND SOLUTIONS AND WATER QUALITY TESTING Pollution is a matter of seriou s concern at local & global level. Pollutant is the fatal, malicious substance in the ecosystem . The elements which are harmful t o the environment and which do not decompose in the ecosystem are ca lled as 'pollutants'. Types and causes of pollution: Air pollution : If the amount of hazardous substances in the atmosphere of the Earth's increases, then these ill -fated airways create many health problems and environme ntal problems, which results in air pollution. The thickness of ozone layer in the outer atm osphere of the Earth is depleting due to excessive release of ozone depleting substances. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide emitted in the atmosphere and cause problems like global temperature rise. Climate change is the global environmental problem occurring in the world and due to this there is unexpected rainfall, drought, hailstorm, and change in monsoon cycle. Growing population, industrialization, urbanization these are the important factors which increase air pollution. Many of the air pollutants are human -centric. Major elements of Air Pollution a. Sulfur dioxide: This gas is produced primarily by the thermal power stations after the burning of coal. Some industrial processes produce sulfur dioxide.eg Paper making and melti ng of metals etc. Sulfur Dioxide is responsible for formation black fog and acid rain. This gas can cause lung diseases. b. Nitrogen oxides : Car exhaust, emissions from electric power plants , burning of various fuels, cigarette smoking, welding etc. are important sources of nitrogen oxide. Nitrogen oxide combines with organic compounds forms black fog and acid rain. c. Carbon monoxide (CO) : Carbon monoxide is al so a pollutant. B urning of vehicle fuel releases Carbon monoxide . It is a colorless & odorless gas produced by partial burning of petrol, diesel, wood and carbon -based fuels. Exposure to CO results in vision problems, Loss of consciousness, Na usea and vomiting, breathing problems etc. d. Carbon dioxide (CO2) : CO2 is a natural compound present everywhere in the atmosphere . Volcanic eruptions, spri ng wa ter, burning of fuels, emissions from industries are the sources of CO2production. Exposure to CO2can lead to serious health problems such as L oss of vision, breat hing problems , MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 189 Headaches, Dizziness, Unconsciousness, n ervous system damage, vomiting, Skin burns etc. e. Lead : Lead is a naturally occurring heavy metal. Petrol, Diesel, Batteries, Paints are important sources of lead. Leadis cancerous can cause damag e to the entire la rynx. f. Ozone : Ozone present in the stratosphere protects the Earth from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. Ozone in the lower layer of atmosphere gives greenhouse effect . Vehicles and factories are the main source ofozone emissions in lo wer atmosphere .Ozone causes eye diseases , burns etc. Ozone reduces your immune response against colds and pneumonia. Impact of air pollution: \u00b7 Air Pollution can cause major respiratory disorder, such as as thma, cancer . \u00b7 Ultraviolet r ays can cause skin disorders, eye diseases, and reduce the immune system. \u00b7 Excess nitrogen in the air can develop respiratory disorders . \u00b7 Extra sulfur diox ide can also lead to acid rain and damage the historical objects. \u00b7 Air pollution can cause damage to the immune, reproducti ve, and respiratory systems. \u00b7 Toxic pollutants can cause damage to the different layers of ecosystem . b. Water Pollution: Chemical s effluents from industries , agricultural and household waste, are the main sources of water pollution. In many rivers or other water bodies, disposal of industrial & household waste, dumping of garbage, results in water pollution. Oil spills also results in accumulation of oily layers on the water surface which destroys the aquatic ecosystem. Effluents from pesticide & fertilizer industrycan cause damage to aquatic ecosystem. Prevention of water pollution: Harmful effluents from industries need to be treated before discharge in the water body. Avoid river side disposal of household waste & garbage. \u00b7 Avoid cleaning & washing of vehicles, animals in to the fresh river water. Eutrophication is the state of excessive nutrients in water body. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 190 Runoff from agricultural land, excessive use of fertilizers, releases the excess nutrients in the wa ter body. Increased amount of nutrients in the water increases the growth of algae; which consumes the amount of oxygen in the water. Covered water surface prevents the penetration of sun rays in the water body. This prevents the photosynth esis process of aquatic plants. Oxygen deficiency causes wide-spread death in the water. Fig 14 - Eutrophication Water testing through H2O strip: - We need to ensure the water we drink is safe and clean. We can use H2O strip for testing quality of water as follows - Important aspects: \u00b7 Water from only one source should be tested in one time \u00b7 We should not mix water from 2 -3 sources for testing \u00b7 Water sample should be stored in clean bottles. \u00b7 It takes 48 hours to te st the water. After 48 hours we can observe the change in water color. \u00b7 Procedure: 1. Take 100 ml of water sampli ng sterilized bottle . 2. Fill the sample water in the H2O Strip Bottle till the given mark. 3. Close the cap of water bottle well. 4. Slowly shake the bottle, so that the H 20 strip can react to the water sample. 5. Keep this bottle at around 30 -37 degree temperature for 48 hours in one place. Checking the test results: \u00b7 If the color of water turns blacks it means the water is not clean and it is not safe for drinking. \u00b7 If the color of water does not change or it is yellowish it means the water is clean and it is safe for drinking. Sterilization through pressure cooker: The temperature inside pressure cooker rises up to 120 degree c. Most of the bacteria and other harmful organisms can survive only until 60 -90 degree of temperature, therefore in the high temperature MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 191 of pressure cooker anything which is cooked until 20 min utes, is sterilized completely. 3. Noise Pollution: - Sound m ore than 90 decibels can cause damage to the hearing capacity results in deafness , increased heart rate, head each, sleep disturbances, hypertension etc. Thus the high intensity sound can be c alled as noise pollution. High decibel sound of vehicles, horns, Fire crackers , loudspeaker, airplane, train, industries, and machines can cause noise pollution. Effects of Sound pollution: \u00b7 Prolonged exposure to loud noise causes disturbance in sleep, irritability, stress, tension, and heart diseas e etc. \u00b7 Noisy environment can increase the blood pressure. \u00b7 Due to heavy noise pollution most of construction workers suffer from heari ng deficiencies. It can be called as occupational diseases. \u00b7 High level of sound affects the health of pregnant women , newly born baby & elderly people . Prevention and remedy of noise pollution: \u00b7 Road side plantation of trees reduces the intensity of noise pollution by absorbing sound. \u00b7 Avoid un -necessary use of horns & loudspeakers. \u00b7 The places li ke airports, Industries, railway stations should be placed far from residential places. \u00b7 There should be proper check on the misuse of loudspeakers. 5. Public awareness should be spread regarding the impacts of noise pollution. 4. Radioactive pollution: Radioactive Pollution is caused by the increase d amount of radiations in the environment . Mining, emissions from nuclear power p lant, radiations from gamma -x rays are some sources of rad ioactive pollution. Radioactive pollutants give rise to chronic diseases like cancer. Small amounts of radiation can also cause diseases. 5. Soil Pollution Some a mount of organic & inorganic ions, salts and minerals are naturally present in the soil and they are formed majo rly through deco mposition of plants and animals . Human activities like excessive use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, industrial effluents , radioactive emissions results in soil pollution. Polluted soli affects the growth of plants. Some pollutants can enter in to the food chain through soil pollution affects the human beings. Promoting use of organic pesticides & MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 192 fertilizers, avoid using chemical fertilizers & pe sticide can prevent the soil pollution.

Of which 20% of people suffer due to poor cleanliness. And 55% of food -borne problems arises due to due to improper cooking and storage. Purpose - 1. Saf e transfer of food / study of various methods adopted for safe transfer of food 2. Understanding the difference between early deteriorating and sustainable food items 3. Packed foods and loose foods 4. Study of advantages and disadvantages of fresh and sta le food Types of Food Contaminants - There are two types of components that contaminate foodstuffs. 1. Environmental contaminants 2. Artificial contaminants Environmental contaminants - air, water, soil etc. Non-environmental/Artificial contaminants - components related to the maintenance of food items, utensils used for placing materials, equipment etc. If the microbes enter the food through these two types of components, they become contaminated. Special care should be taken, while storing food and moving from one place to another. In order to avoid food contamination, cleanliness and hygiene should be maintained in each chain of food production to transfer. To avoid food contamination, practice the following written rules of hygiene and health: 1. Keep the atmosphere clean - High-quality hygiene should be maintained at the place of harvesting crops, food storage and performing any action related to food. Ultrasonic violet ray lamps are used to keep the air clean in many food industries and factories. Food laboratories and kitchens at home should have good ventilation. In order to kill chips, cockroaches and food insects, pesticides should be sprayed periodically. Walls, roofs should be painted and white washed periodically and floor should also be was hed and cleaned. 2. Maintenance of food items - There are innumerable microbes on vegetables and fruits. Numerous bacteria are also found on eggs, meat and fish. Therefore, washing these foods well with water before cooking and eating can save you from many types of infections. For those who handle food items, it is very important to practice the following points: MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 194 a) Every person who handles food items should do regular medical check -up, to know that they do not have any infectious diseases. b) Such person s should cut their nails and keep them clean. Before handling food, wash your hands with clean water and soap. Clean clothes should be used to wipe hands. If the cloth is unclean then there may be several infections. There is a possibility of food contamin ation from human hair as well. Hair should be well tied with the help ofhandkerchiefs or scarf. The person should wear clean clothes while handling food. 3. Cleanliness of the place to prepare food - The place where food is prepared should be clean and hy gienic. It would be best if the surface is covered with smooth stones like granite, marble, etc. The reason for this is that, cleaning the surface like this is very easy and comfortable. Workplace, cooking utensils, pots, stove, appliances etc. should be c leaned with soap and water every day. 4. Cleaning of equipment and utensils - Kitchen utensils and equipment such as knives, tongs, spoons etc. should be sterilized by hot water or steam. Similarly, a mixer, juicer (fruit juice preparation machine), and cooking utensils should also be disinfected. 5. Use of clean water - On washing food items / cereals with impure water, microbes enter into the food and food becomes contaminated. Clean water should be used for cooking food. In particular, there should b e use of filter water to make beverages in factories making drinks. 6. Remaining food and waste disposal - Cover the remaining food or keep it at a cold place or in the refrigerator. The remaining portion of fruit peel, vegetables and other food items sho uld not be thrown directly into the trash. We can prepare a good type of compost with organic waste. A clean lid should be placed on the trash. If the garbage box remains open, then the air gets spoiled by the existing microbes in garbage box. With such me asures, we will get clean and edible food. Advantages of Packaged food: 1. Packaged food is convenient for Transportation and storage. 2. Packaging helps to reduces exposure to air contaminants . Allows safe handling of food without contamination. 3. Convenient to distribute large amount of food items. 4. Packaged foods have weight of the substance written on the box, according to which food stuffs can be purchased as per the requirement. Disadvantages of Packaged food: 1. Many times, many food items are being bought by attractive packing and are not needed. 2. Eating packaged food ends the desire to eat fresh food. 3. The quality of packaged foods is not always the best and many times these substances are infected. It is difficult to guarantee their nutrition and quality. In many places, prepared foods are sold, which are not packed. Examples - sandwich, bhel, panipuri etc. MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 195 Advantages of unpacked/loose food: 1. If the foods are fresh and clean, they will definitely be nutritious and taste good. 2. We can eat according to our taste and choice like chutney etc. Disadvantages of unpacked/loose food: 1. It is difficult to transport the unpacked food from one place to another. 2. Extensive scale distribution of these substances is not possible. 3. Fly, du st, etc. can easily contaminate these foods. It is very necessary to follow the rules of hygiene. 4. Preparing these foods consumes a lot of time. Classification of food according to the length of time of storage - The food items have been divided into th e following three groups, according to their storage life: 1) Non -perishable food 2) Semi -perishable food 3) Perishable food 1. Non-perishable food Proper handling of these foods i.e. storing these food in a dry and cool place, will keep them in good condition for a long time. These food items last for 6 months to two years. The following foods come under this category: 1. Whole grains - wheat, jowar, millet, ragi, oats 2. Pulses and their beans - mung, lentils, chickpeas, rajma, lobiya, moth bean, soya bean, peas, urad (Black gram), tur (Pigeon pea) etc. Fruits with oilseed and tough coverings - Seeds, peanuts, sesame, dry coconut, mustard, linseed 3. Hard shelled nuts / fruits - walnuts, almonds, cashews 4. Sugar - Sugar is mainly prepared from sugarca ne. This includes candy/rock sugar, sugar powder, etc. 5. Jaggery - it is also made from sugarcane. All these foods are non -perishable. Less amount of water increases the sustainability of food product. The quantity of water in whole grains and sugar is 9 to 15 percent. Amount of water is 4% in jaggery and sugar. In foods that have less water content, the likelihood of microorganisms is less and these foods have long shelf life, so these foods are called non -perishable foods. 2. Semi -perishable food - These f oods may remain unspoiled for 2 weeks to a few months. These foods include semolina (suji), white flour (maida), poha, butter, potato, onion, ginger, garlic etc. A) Processed -cereals and pulses etc. Wheat and rice flour, semolina (suji), white flour (maida ), poha, puffed rice, gram, pulses etc. are Semi -perishable foods. B) Roots - Potato, apple, onion, suran (elephant foot yam) etc. C) Oil and ghee - Homemade ghee and oil, butter. The water is found in abundance (60 - 70%) in mustard, coconut, groundnut, et c. So these are semi - MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 196 perishabl e foods. If the oil and ghee comes in contact with the air for longer periods of time, then the contact with oxygen makes them to smell bad. 3. Perishable food - These foods can stay unspoiled only for 1 day in the atmosphere. T hese foods contain water from 80 to 90%. So they get spoiled immediately. Examples of these foods - fresh fruits and vegetables, animal foods, milk, eggs, poultry, meat, etc. Methods of Storing Perishable Foods - Perishable foods are those likely to spoil or decay . Without processing, it difficult to stay good for a long er period. It is necessary to process the food while maintaining its quality, in order to store the food for longer duration and to reach customers. The period between food production and c onsumption can be a few hours or several years. That is why it is important to know the reason for food spoilage or decay and accordingly, it is necessary to have a protective action for it. The food conservation process has to be decided to remove the mic ro-organism from food. A suitable environment is to be created to destroy the already existing micro -organisms. The following points should be kept in mind to increase the duration of perishable food items: 1. Keep microorganisms away from food 2. Preventing the growth of micro -organisms already present in the food 3. To destroy or deactivate microorganisms in food 4. Increasing the duration of ripening caused by enzymes and natural chemical reactions due to air contact etc. 5. Avoidance of loss due to traffic etc. The goals of food conservation procedures performed on perishable foods - 1. Increasing the length of time of food storage 2. Safe food 3. Less wastage of leftover food 4. Providing food items for the whole year 5. Value addition and more profits 6. Making different types of food products available to customers 7. Fruits and vegetables are available at cheap price in every season. Preserving the fruits during the same season can prove to be a good business approach. 8. Increasing diges tibility, taste and color. Process to increase the period of destruction of some perishable foods has been given: Value added food production Process method Process element Milk Pasteurization Low temperature Chicken To be kept in the fridge Low temperature Peas Solidification Low temperature Milk powder Drying Removing moisture MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 197 Pomegranate Drying in the sun Removing moisture Fenugreek Solar dryers Removing moisture Packaging of vegetables Vacuum Packing Oxygen removal Guava, Guava jelly Natural preservatives, wet heat Increasing osmotic pressure Tomato sauce and pickle Natural acid protection, wet heat Reducing pH Curd, yoghurt Fermentation Reducing pH Fish, Potato Ionizing radiation/ cold sterilization Reduction in the number of microbes Milk, Fruit juice Sterilized packing Keeping microorganisms away Fruits, vegetables, raw and cooked meat Controlling the amount of O2 and CO2 Reducing pH Method of safe transfer of farming products - India is an agricultural country. There ha s been a tradition of preserving the agricultural products. Due to globalization, transferring of agricultural products has become more convenient. New methods of packing has evolved to carry food products. Secure packing and careful operation are basic re quirements, which helps in the safe transfer of food from the fields to customers. The need for conservation of perishable farm products - 1. Farm products does not get damaged due to overload or crushing during transportation 2. Safety from wild animals, example rat etc. 3. Protection from insects etc. 4. Keeping safe from rain water 5. Biological protection Conservation practices of perishable farm products - 1. Packing - By using different protection methods, the farming material can be protected during transportation and circulation. Wood, cans, plastic carats etc. can be used. By using plastic mesh and laminated plastic packing, vegetables, fruits can be transferred securely. 2. Storeroom to collect grain - In ancient times, there was a method of conserving grain by building a kothi (store room). To secure the grains, they used to build a kothi at some height above the ground. Kothi built by using iron or sticks are used to preserve the grains. The kothi is wrapped from the dung from the outside. The c ottage made from cow dung is completely sterilized, due to which the grain does not have any kind of insect. But after wrapping the kothi in cow dung, it is necessary to dry it in the sun. To keep the onion safe, wood roof is made at height. The onions are dried and kept on the roof. Keeping in it does not spoil the onion. Rats are not able to reach there because of the wooden timber being at some height. Fresh and stale food - MULTI SECTOR - MULTI SKILL ASSISTANT TECHNICIAN Page | 198 A) Fresh Foods - 1. Acceptability of these foods is good. The taste, color, tem perature, appearance etc. of fresh foods are much better, therefore, it is more tasty, such as boiled hot coffee, cold milk shake, hot biryani etc. 2. Fresh foods are hot - they do not have to be heated again, so they are delicious. 3. Fresh foods are easi er to digest than stale foods. It also takes less time to cook fresh food. B) Stale foods - There is no use of eating stale food, that is, this type of food is harmful to the body. 1. Acceptance of stale food is less than fresh food. 2. We eat stale food items by heating them again and again due to which the nutrients of food are destroyed and food flavor decreases. 3. If we eat cold stale food, then the digestive system has to work hard to digest it. Benefits of Fresh Hot Diet - When we take fresh, high diet, the gastric intestines of the body are strong for proper digestion of food. The blood, muscles, medulla, etc. of the body are nourished as the result of digestion of the right kind of food by the body's gastric intestines. If the diet is fresh and ho t, then it increases hunger and desire to eat. Unlike them, the desire to eat stale cold food is lost. 1. The consumed food is digested properly. 2. The body gets nourishment. Body functions are smooth. 3. The food looks interesting 4. Food is easily diges ted. 5. Proper excretion of faces and urine due to which the body appears to be lighter 6. Help in maintaining physical balance Because of this, it is necessary that we eat regular fresh hot foods. Consumption of fresh hot food is necessary in all seasons, especially during the rainy and winter seasons.
