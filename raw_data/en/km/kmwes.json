Mag10 is a magnesium supplement created by True Cellular Formulas, a Pennsylvania-based supplement company with a manufacturing location in Salt Lake City. Normal magnesium supplements contain one or two types of magnesium. Mag10, however, contains 10 types of magnesium - from magnesium orotate to magnesium aspartate to magnesium oxide. These different types of magnesium work in different parts of the body. Some cross the blood-brain barrier to affect neurotransmitters in your brain, for example, to help you relax. Others support heart health, immunity, and overall wellness. By taking two capsules of Mag10 daily, you can relieve magnesium deficiency, support sleep and relaxation, and enjoy other effects of magnesium.

Some of the benefits of Mag10 include: - 10 types of magnesium to support health throughout the body - Get a better, more restful night of sleep without melatonin or over-the-counter sleep medication - Support neurotransmitter production for calmness and relaxation - Support nerve and muscle function - Support immune function, detoxification, energy, and more - No fillers or additives: just a significant dose of magnesium in each serving How Does Mag10 Work? Mag10 works by providing you with 10 types of magnesium. These types work in different ways to support different effects throughout the body. Mag10 contains magnesium malate, for example, which is linked to nervous system health and weight control. It also contains magnesium aspartate (for heart health), magnesium glycerophosphate (for energy), and magnesium oxide (for muscle contractions). Many of us get magnesium through food. Some even take magnesium supplements. Unfortunately, these types of magnesium may be difficult for your body to absorb. That's why millions of people have a magnesium deficiency. By giving your body 10 different types of magnesium, you could support various effects throughout the body - from sleep to muscle performance to overall energy. [Learn more on the official website >>>](https://besthealthsupplements.net/mag10) Who Created Mag10? Mag10 was created by a Montana-based scientist, natural health expert, chemist, and geologist named Warren Philips. Using his master's of science degree, Warren claims to have trained hundreds of functional medicine doctors over the last 20 years. Since 2005, Warren claims to have transformed the lives of \"hundreds of thousands of people\" by working with these functional medicine specialists. Warren was motivated to create Mag10 after discovering surprisingly harmful research about melatonin. Many people take melatonin nightly to help them sleep, yet they're silently harming their body. Warren knew magnesium could help with sleep. However, his research showed the body struggled to absorb many ordinary types of magnesium. Even if you take a magnesium supplement, you may have magnesium deficiency because of poor absorption. Warren developed Mag10 to solve these problems, providing you with superior forms of magnesium for a better sleep. How Magnesium Helps with Sleep Magnesium is crucial for sleep. Out of all the minerals, magnesium is linked to relaxation, calmness, and nervous system function more than many others. Many sleep aid supplements contain magnesium for that reason. Some people also take magnesium regularly for nervous system function, calmness, and stress relief. Warren and his team at Mag10 cite research from Princeton University, the Cleveland Clinic, and medical doctors linking magnesium to sleep in multiple ways, including: Dr. Naoki Umeda, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic claims magnesium can help regulate neurotransmitters linked directly to sleep. Your brain is constantly sending messenger chemicals, or neurotransmitters, throughout the body. Magnesium can help encourage the body's production of neurotransmitters linked to sleep. Nicole Avena, PhD, of Princeton University writes how magnesium can help to relax the muscles and increase the function of inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA, helping to reduce anxiety. Magnesium helps your body take protein and convert it into chemicals that help you feel sleepy. Your body needs protein to make certain neurotransmitters and other chemicals. Without magnesium, however, those proteins never get converted. Because of all of these effects, magnesium is crucial for a productive night of sleep.

In fact, the official Mag10 website is filled with warnings about taking melatonin, giving melatonin to kids, and taking melatonin regularly or occasionally for sleep. Some of the reasons to stop taking melatonin, according to the makers of Mag10, include: A top Harvard medical PhD recently issued a \"dire warning\" to stop taking melatonin. Countries like the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia have banned melatonin from stores. In other countries, melatonin is only available by prescription. Despite being controlled or banned by many countries around the world, melatonin is widely available across the United States. You can buy it at gas stations, pharmacies, and department stores. You can find it online and in many natural sleep supplements. Melatonin could cause long-term sleep issues by \"burning out your body's natural sleep receptors,\" according to the manufacturer. You might get a good sleep for a few nights, only to struggle to get a restful sleep in the future. Melatonin \"is the only hormone you can buy 'over the counter' in the U.S.,\" according to the official Mag10 website. Other hormones - like testosterone, insulin, and estrogen - require a prescription or are strictly controlled. Not only can you buy melatonin anywhere in the United States, but you can give it to kids - and many parents do give it to kids. You can even find melatonin supplements with doses as high as 60 mg. In comparison, most studies show melatonin works at doses of 0.5mg, which means some are taking hundreds of times the necessary dose just to fall asleep. Some studies have linked melatonin to dementia, suggesting taking more than 5mg of melatonin per night could increase the risk of cognitive damage. Other melatonin supplements are loaded with added, complementary ingredients that can stress your liver, add toxins to your body, and contribute to health issues. Because of all of these problems with melatonin, the creator of Mag10, Warren Phillips, claims it's his \"passion in life to protect people from the literal lies of the multimillion dollar 'melatonin' industry.\" He developed Mag10 as a simple, natural alternative to melatonin.

Some even take a magnesium supplement. Unfortunately, according to Warren's research, millions of people don't get enough magnesium. Worse, they're not getting the right types of magnesium. This magnesium deficiency can interfere with sleep. Some of the reasons you may be magnesium deficient even with magnesium supplements and a healthy diet include: - Soil Depletion: Years of improper farming techniques have stripped the soil of precious minerals. Today's foods - like grains, fruits, and vegetables - have significantly less nutritional value than they did decades ago because of mono-cropping, pesticide use, and other harmful practices. - Chronic Stress: Stress lowers magnesium. Even if you take plenty of magnesium daily, your stress could lower your magnesium quickly - like a phone battery when you have too many apps open. Most people experience stress daily, and this stress could increase your need for magnesium beyond what you get from supplements and dietary sources. - Environmental Toxins: Microplastics, air pollution, cleaning chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, and other chemicals drain magnesium from your body. We're surrounded by these toxic chemicals constantly, and these chemicals can drain magnesium from your body. According to Warren and the official Mag10 website, \"the average American eats the equivalent of a credit card in 'microplastics' every single week,\" citing a recent study. - Incorrect Types of Magnesium: You might take foods that have magnesium or take supplements that have magnesium. However, you may not be getting the right type of magnesium. There are different types of magnesium paired with different chemical bonds. Some types of magnesium affect the brain, while others affect the body or nervous system. You may take magnesium daily thinking it has beneficial effects, only to be taking the incorrect type of magnesium.

Different types of magnesium have different effects on the body. Magnesium glycinate, for example, is known for helping you sleep, while magnesium ascorbate can support your immune system. Other types of magnesium are linked to nervous system function, muscle development, or heart function, among other effects. Here are all 10 forms of magnesium in Mag10 and how they work, according to Warren and his team: - Magnesium Glycinate for Sleep: Magnesium glycinate is the best-known form magnesium for sleep, and many people take magnesium glycinate daily for sleep, rest, and relaxation. It helps calm the mind and body and prepare you for sleep, for example. It can also promote bone health, support heart health, and help with anxiety, among other benefits. By binding magnesium with the amine \"glycine,\" magnesium glycinate can cross the blood-brain barrier to achieve noticeable effects on the brain - like rest and relaxation. It's one of the most important - and most science-backed - forms of magnesium in Mag10. also known as magnesium taurinate, for heart health. It's a bond between magnesium and taurine, an amino acid essential for human health. According to the makers of Mag10, magnesium taurate \"can do wonders for your heart\" by supporting healthy blood pressure. Poor sleep quality can increase blood pressure, making you more stressed and creating a vicious cycle. By taking magnesium taurate and the other forms of magnesium in Mag10, you could promote a better sleep and promote cardiovascular health at the same time for optimal wellness. - Magnesium L-Aspartate for Energy: Mag10 contains magnesium L-aspartate to boost energy, flush toxins from the body, and enhance immune function. If you're deficient in nutrients like magnesium, your body may not be performing at its peak. By providing you with magnesium L-aspartate, Mag10 can help detoxify your body, helping your body focus on more immediate concerns. - Magnesium Chelate for Muscles: Mag10 contains magnesium chelate, a specific form of magnesium linked to muscle performance. Some take magnesium chelate during or after a workout, for example. Others take it daily for joint pain and general aches and pains. - Magnesium Ascorbate for Immunity: Magnesium ascorbate is a bond between a form of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and magnesium. It may support immunity and promote overall immune function while being gentle on the stomach. Your immune system needs various vitamins, minerals, and nutrients for optimal function. Mag10 contains magnesium ascorbate to provide your body with the nutrients needed for optimal function. It can also help with muscle and nerve signaling, calmness, and sleep quality, among other benefits. - Dimagnesium Malate for Headaches / Soreness: Dimagnesium malate is a blend between malic acid and magnesium. Although malic acid sounds like an unusual ingredient, it's a natural chemical found in certain types of fruits. By bonding this chemical to magnesium, dimagnesium malate could help with headaches and general soreness throughout the body. Some take it for migraines, while others take it for muscle aches and pains. Dimagnesium malate, like many other types of magnesium in Mag10, can also help with stomach problems and overall digestive health while relaxing the mind and helping you sleep. - Magnesium Oxide for Your Bones & Stomach: Magnesium oxide is a common supplement for bone health and digestion. Chemically, it's a bond between oxygen and magnesium. Many people take magnesium oxide daily for digestive health. It may help with constipation, digestive regularity, and bloating, for example. According to the official Mag10 website, magnesium oxide can also help lower blood pressure and make bones stronger, among other benefits. - Magnesium Orotate for Athletic Performance: Some athletes take magnesium orotate for performance. It's known for boosting heart health, aiding in recovery, and enhancing energy and performance in multiple ways. Like many other types of magnesium in Mag10, it's also known for calming the body and helping you fall asleep. - Magnesium Citrate for Arterial Stiffness: As you get older, your arteries tend to stiffen. This can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of cardiovascular events - like heart attacks and stroke. Mag10 contains a specific type of magnesium for arterial stiffness called magnesium citrate. Described as \"one of the 'gentlest' forms of magnesium,\" the ingredient can help with bloating and arterial stiffness, according to some studies. - Magnesium Glycerophosphate for GABA: Magnesium glycerophosphate is a GABA booster known to soothe anxiety, support GABA production, and allow your mind to rest overall. According to the official Mag10 website, this specific type of magnesium is \"incredible for getting better sleep.\" GABA is a crucial neurotransmitter for rest and relaxation. When your body produces normal amounts of GABA, you can rest and relax, fall asleep more easily, and stay asleep throughout the night.

Scientific Evidence for Mag10 Can taking 10 different types of magnesium really be better than taking one or two types of magnesium? How does Mag10 work for overall health? What does science say about Mag10? We'll review some of the science behind Mag10 below. Magnesium malate has shown promise as a weight loss supplement. In a 2018 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7009340/), researchers found magnesium malate could help average, healthy adults lose weight and maintain a healthy weight. The makers of Mag10 added magnesium malate to the formula for headaches and muscle soreness, but it can also help with weight management. Mag10 was created with the goal of solving magnesium deficiency. Many of us are deficient in magnesium even when we take a magnesium supplement or eat magnesium-enriched foods. One specific type of magnesium in Mag10, magnesium aspartate, appears to be particularly effective for relieving magnesium deficiency. One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15726904/) found magnesium aspartate raised magnesium levels when taken as a supplement, for example. The makers of Mag10 added magnesium oxide to the supplement specifically for heart health and arterial stiffness. Some studies have connected this specific type of magnesium to cardiovascular health effects. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6540466/), for example, found taking a magnesium oxide supplement could help with arterial stiffness in a group of healthy, overweight individuals. Arterial stiffness increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. Overall, the 10 types of magnesium in Mag10 are backed by ample scientific evidence showing they work to provide significant effects throughout the body - from heart health to brain health to energy, immunity, and more.
