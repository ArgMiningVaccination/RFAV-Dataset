The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health April 6, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30095-X Purpose To understand the effectiveness of school closure and other school-based social distancing practices in affecting infection rates and transmission of coronaviruses during disease outbreaks. Study design Systematic Review (n=16 studies included) Level of evidenceLevel 1 Methods Authors performed a systematic review of pre-prints and papers available in PubMed, the WHO Global Database on COVID-19, and medRxiv to assess the effects of school closure during coronavirus outbreaks with disease transmis - sion. Findings Sixteen studies included from a total of 618 that predominantly covered coronavirus outbreaks in Asian countries during the early 21st century. School closures on their own may be insufficient to mitigate coronavi - rus spread, versus the influenza virus where school closures show to be effective as primary mitigation tactic. Authors acknowledged a UK study, which estimates that school closures may reduce total COVID-19 deaths by only 2-4% and highlights the need for school dismissal to prevent a serious outbreak. Clinical ImplicationsSchool closures drastically reduce influenza transmission in the general pop - ulation, however not with coronavirus. Data on coronavirus infections has shown school closures to be much less impactful as a primary mitigation factor in decreasing transmission in the general public. Limitations Seven of sixteen included studies have not been peer reviewed. Only one modeling study (not peer reviewed) compared school closures with other mitigating factors for COVID-19. PUBLIC HEALTHReview by Josh Doppelt, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubCovid-19: control measures must be equitable and inclusive Zackary Berger et al. The BMJ April 21, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1141 Purpose Highlight necessary efforts within COVID-19 response, notably free testing and employment rights, to most inclusively address needs of all individuals, including vulnerable populations Study design Editorial Level of evidenceNot applicable Methods Not applicable Findings Provision of free testing for COVID-19, and healthcare for COVID-19-related con - cerns and pre-existing conditions, for all individuals is vital. This will support com - munity mitigation efforts and relieve burden on emergency departments and walk- in clinics. Support should be provided for organizations addressing lack of housing, food and medication, especially with forced closures of supporting institutions (ex. schools). Employees should be provided financial support, in the event they require home quarantine or sick days, in order to best optimize community mitigation ef - forts. Healthcare workers and first responders should be provided the appropriate protective equipment and mental health resources, to address both physical and mental wellbeing. Clinical ImplicationsHealthcare, for COVID-19-related concerns and pre-existing conditions, should be provided to everyone, including the homeless , udocumented immigrants , and others with poor healthcare access. Employment rights and protection should be provided. This includes allowing employees to prioritize individual and communi - ty health without fear of financial loss, as well as providing appropriate protective equipment and mental health resources for healthcare workers. Limitations The article is limited in its study design; as an editorial piece, it has strong referenc - es yet lacks higher level of evidence that could limit applicability. It highlights key considerations for city and state officials to address in their COVID-19 responses, but may require further analyses of their unique populations to better inform the details of most inclusive interventions.PUBLIC HEALTHReview by Laura Hurley, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubCOVID-19 and African Americans Clyde W. Yancy JAMA April 15, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jama.2020.6548 Purpose Evaluate particular risk factors and social determinants of health negatively affecting health outcomes for African American patients with COVID-19. Study design Perspective/viewpoint article Level of evidenceN/A Methods Review of available evidence to support the central claim: underserved minorities are developing COVID-19 more frequently and dying dispropor - tionately (a 6-fold increase in the rate of death for African-American patients infected with coronavirus). Findings In Chicago, greater than 50% of COVID-19 cases and approximately 70% of COVID-19 deaths involve black individuals, even though blacks only make up 30% of the population . Additionally, these deaths are more concentrated in 5 neighborhoods in Chicago's South Side. This spread is similar in both Louisiana, Michigan, and New York City. There is a higher prev - alence of known risk factors for COVID-19 complications (hypertension, dia - betes, obesity, cardiovascular disease) in black patients. Social determinents of health further exacerbate risk factors (i.e. higher housing density impairing social distancing, poor access to healthy foods affecting immunity). Clinical ImplicationsThis viewpoint/perspective lends a historical and epidemiological dimension to the factual evidence that outcomes for African-Americans suffering with COVID-19 are worse. Author addresses this severe COVID-19 infection and death in black individuals to low socio-economic status and health care dis - parity. Limitations This is a viewpoint article and thus may have inherent bias from the author and also uses epidemiological studies which are prone to effects from con - founding variables.PUBLIC HEALTHReview by Eiftu Haile, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubA brief telephone severity scoring system and therapeutic living cen - ters solved acute hospital-bed shortage during the COVID-19 out - break in Daegu, Korea Shin-Woo Kim et al. J Korean Med Sci April 20, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e152 Purpose To study the efficacy of telephone-based screening to determine the level of care coronavirus-positive individuals received during a hospital bed shortage in the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design Case series (n=6610) Level of evidence4 Methods Physicians in Daegu (Korea) developed a remote screening tool for COVID-posi - tive individuals during a hospital-bed shortage. This telephone screener utilized a point system for disease symptom severity, age, pre-existing conditions, and social factors. Based on point totals, individuals were sent to a tertiary hospital, public hospital, or therapeutic living center to quarantine. This protocol was put in place on February 29th presumably through March 29th, 2020. Findings Only 81/3033 (2.67%) patients admitted to therapeutic living centers for quarantining were transferred to the hospital for higher level care. Only three patients out of 6,610 cumulative cases, between February 18th and March 29th, died at home while awaiting a hospital bed. Clinical ImplicationsIn the event of hospital bed shortage, health systems will need to quickly deter - mine which level of care each patient needs in order to be efficient with resourc - es. While this study has numerous limitations, remote screening tools may be an effective way to triage patients with known COVID-19 prior to hospital arrival. The US does not have sufficient community screening for most individuals to know their COVID-19 status, which hinders this protocol from being effective in the US. However, if community testing increases, remote screening like this may warrant further study. Limitations Authors did not specify where the COVID-positive patients are tested (communi - ty vs in hospital setting). They did not have a clear end date listed for the study, so we do not know how long this protocol was studied for. The data also does not clearly indicate that remote screening decreased the number of persons waiting for hospital beds in the setting of a decrease in new COVID-19 cases in Daegu.PUBLIC HEALTHReview by Josh Doppelt, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubThe Untold Toll - The Pandemic's Effects on Patients without Covid-19 Lisa Rosenbaum The New England Journal of Medicine April 17, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMms2009984 Purpose To highlight the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on non-COVID-19 patients, their experi - ence navigating care during the pandemic, and health outcomes. Study design Editorial Level of evidence5 Methods N/A Findings -Patients receiving cancer-related treatment have been forced to delay mainte - nance therapies and related procedures due to risk of immunosuppression, potential need for high-demand resources (ie. ICU), and high-exposure risk due to significant hos - pital time. Others are receiving therapies in re-adjusted sequences; for example, delay - ing surgery and receiving systemic treatment first instead for select solid cancers. -Many procedures identified as 'elective' are not necessarily elective; these cases must be examined on a case-by-case basis ; broad delay of such interventions, notably cardiac-related cases, may inappropriately prohibit care for patients who otherwise only have weeks to months to live. -Consideration of exposure risk, for patients and healthcare workers, has resulted in significant negative changes in patient experience ; experiences cited include diffi - cult multi-disciplinary discussions conducted over the phone, and limited visitor hours, creating an emotional, financial and physical toll on patients and loved ones. Clinical ImplicationsPreviously known standards of care for all patients, notably those seeking care for non- COVID-19 related illnesses, have been challenged by balancing the safety and needs of patients, protection of healthcare workers, and threatened depletion of necessary resources. - Intentional gestures from physicians, such as communicating reasoning for newly changed therapy options or procedure timeline, have helped patients feel cared for and understood despite decreased patient contact and increased telehealth consultations. Limitations The study contains primarily anecdotal experiences of providers and patients in New York; the small representation and limited geographical sampling may not adequately capture the larger population experience. However, this chosen location of New York has experienced significant COVID-19 burden. Additionally, anecdotal experiences do play a valuable role as we continuously aim to close the gap in our understanding of COVID-19, develop an appropriate response and protocols, and grasp the impact on all individuals.PUBLIC HEALTHReview by Laura Hurley, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubPerceptions and behavioural responses of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-sectional survey of UK adults Christina J Atchison et al. medRxiv preprint April 3, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050039 Purpose To examine risk perceptions, behavioral responses, and intention to comply with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) of the UK adult population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Study design Cross-sectional survey (n=2108) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods A survey was emailed to a nationally representative sample of UK adults and adminis - tered by YouGov (a market research company) between March 17-18, 2020. The ques - tionnaire had four components: socio-demographic characteristics, risk perceptions towards COVID-19, preventative behaviors, and willingness and ability to self-isolate. Data was collected and sent to Imperial College London research team for analysis. Findings 94.2% (n=1,992) of respondents reported at least one preventative measure: 85.8% washed their hands more frequently, 56.5% avoided crowded areas and 54.5% avoided social events. Adoption of social distancing was higher in those aged over 70 com - pared to ages 18-34. Those with the lowest household income were 6 times less likely to be able to work from home (adjusted odds ratio, aOR: 0.16) and 3 times less likely to be able to self-isolate (aOR: 0.31). Ability to self-isolate was also lower in black and minority ethnic groups (aOR: 0.47). Willingness to self-isolate was high across all re - spondents. Clinical Implications\u00b7 This study highlights the barriers that those in lower socio-economic groups face and predicts that the impact of this pandemic will be felt unequally in our society. The study recommends governments implement appropriate social and economic policies to mitigate this. \u00b7 Incorporating differences in non-pharmaceutical intervention adherence among so - cio-economic subpopulations can improve mathematical models of transmission and outcomes. Limitations The study was limited by the online survey, which responses of those without in - ternet access were under-represented. Second, the survey tool used predominantly closed-ended questions, limiting the ability explore responses in more depth. Final - ly, using self-report data has limitations including honesty, introspective ability, and question interpretation. This study still has to be peer-reviewed.PUBLIC HEALTHReview by Katherine Tehaney, MS1 of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubGenomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel corona - virus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding Roujian Lu et al. Lancet January 20, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30251-8 Purpose To sequence and characterize the genome of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov). Study design Case Series (n = 9 patients) Level of evidenceNot applicable Methods Isolates collected from nine inpatients of three area hospitals in Wuhan, China pre - senting with viral pneumonia of unknown origin. Researchers studied eight com - plete and two partial genomes obtained from the nine study patients. Findings Novel coronavirus 19 belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus. The virus is more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains (88% identity) than (SARS-CoV: 79% identity, MERS-CoV: 50% identity). Howev - er, there was greater similarity in S1 domain of the spike protein of the novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV , possibly suggesting the novel coronavirus might also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) as a cell receptor (as SARS-CoV is known to do). There is likely an intermediate host, currently unknown, between bats and humans for novel coronavirus. Clinical ImplicationsThe genomes of the virus across all patient samples were remarkably similar, indicating a common source of infection. Not all patients had visited the Hua - nan wet market, also supporting hypothesized human-to-human transmission via droplets. Identification of the 2019-nCov intermediate host could facilitate further understanding of disease control during this pandemic. Like SARS-CoV, the 2019- nCoV uses ACE2 as a receptor, although there were key variances in the recep - tor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV . Further research is necessary to determine the significance of this similarity, and how it could affect the diagnosis and treatment of the virus, as well as vaccine development. Limitations While likely due to the urgency surrounding the health crisis of this novel coronavi - rus, this study only analyzed sequences from isolates of a small number of patients. Future research is needed to map the changes in genome sequencing of this virus as it spreads throughout the world.BIOLOGYReview by Beth Hall, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubComparative replication and immune activation profiles of SARS- CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in human lungs: an ex vivo study with implica - tions for the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Hin Chu et al. Clinical Infectious Diseases April 9, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa410 Purpose To compare viral kinetics, cell tropism, and immune response profiles of SARS- CoV-2 and SARS-CoV to understand the mechanism behind transmission and pre - sentation of COVID-19. Study design Case Series (n = 6 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Six patients undergoing wedge resection or lobectomy for lung tumor donated tissue to be inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Virus titers measured at 2, 24, and 48 hours, and tissues underwent panel of representative IFNs and pro-in - flammatory cytokines/chemokines. Findings SARS-CoV-2 antigens detected in significantly higher amount and in more areas of the lung tissues than SARS-CoV antigens. SARS-CoV-2 generated 3.20 folds more infectious virus particles in 48 hours than SARS-CoV (P<0.024). Both SARS- CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infected type II pneumocytes, and alveo - lar macrophages. SARS-CoV-2 infection did not significantly trigger the expression of any IFN, compared to SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 infection only significantly upregu - lated 5 of 13 inflammatory mediators, compared to 8 of 13 in SARS-CoV. Clinical ImplicationsThe high degree of replication and viral particles of SARS-CoV-2 may explain high viral loads in COVID-19 patients presenting early in the disease course, and possibly during intubation. The SARS-CoV-2 triggers fewer pro-inflamma - tory markers than SARS-CoV , potentially explaining why many patients remain asymptomatic or with mild symptoms throughout their disease course. Future re - search should explore how the mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 suppresses the IFN and cytokine/chemokine response. Limitations Ex-vivo human lung tissue explant culture doesn't represent the effect of host systemic inflammatory response and the adaptive immune response. Human tissue supply is limited, and is not a viable option to investigate the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. This study used a small sample size, and all lung tissue donators were diagnosed with lung cancer, as such the results might not be generalizable to the larger population.BIOLOGYReview by Jackie Urban, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubStructural and Functional Basis of SARS-CoV-2 Entry by Using Hu - man ACE2 Qihui Wang et al. Cell April 7, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045 Purpose To analyze the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) entry receptor as a binding site for SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Study design Descriptive Study Level of evidenceNot applicable Methods Immunostaining and flow cytometry were used to identify the spike (S) glycopro - tein subunits of SARS-CoV-2 which interact the hACE2 receptor. SARS-CoV-2/ hACE2 complexes were analyzed in-vitro via size exclusion chromatography to study virus-receptor interaction and complex formation. Surface plasmon reso - nance (SPR) assay was used to affinity SARS- CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The epitope features SARS-CoV-2 were murine monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV and MERS- CoV S proteins. Findings Entry of coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by the S glycoprotein. Immu - nostaining and flow cytometry with SARS-CoV-2 S protein preparations revealed a strong affinity for hACE2 binding, and the complex was largely similar to the structure of the SARS-CoV/hACE2 complex. SARS-CoV-2-CTD binding interface displayed significantly stronger interactions with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV, with more amino acid residues that directly bind the hACE2 receptor, more hydro - gen bonds, and larger buried surface areas resulting in overall increased atomic interactions. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a 4-fold higher binding affinity for the hACE2 receptor when compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Clinical ImplicationsMonoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against both SARS-CoV and MERS- CoV were unable to bind the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, despite the shared character - istic of these three coronaviruses to engage the hACE2 receptor for entry into host cells. This lack of monoclonal antibody binding indicates distinct antigenic features of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that reduce the effectiveness of potential vaccine therapies utilized in previous coronavirus outbreaks. Limitations Additional research is needed to determine the efficacy of vaccines and their role in targeting S proteins for SARS-CoV-2 as a means of prophylaxis.BIOLOGYReview by Emily Hejna, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubComposition and divergence of coronavirus spike proteins and host ACE2 receptors predict potential intermediate hosts of SARSCoV2 Zhixin Liu et al. Journal of Medical Virology February 26, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25726 Purpose To identify potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans by characterizing various species' coronavirus spike protein and its interaction with angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Study design Observational study Level of evidenceNot applicable Methods Protein sequences of ACE2 SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat SARS-like in addition to the bat SARS-like CoV RaTG13 sequence and the pangolin metagenome. Protein sequence alignment and phylo - genetic analysis was accomplished using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA-X) software, and multiple comparisons were done by ClustalW. Structure and binding models of the spike receptor were accomplished using I-TASSER, PRISM 2.0, and Findings SARS-CoV-2 receptorbinding pangolin SARS-like RaTG13. SARS-CoV and CoV-2 enter the respiratory tract by the receptor ACE2 and were found to have good alignment. An interaction model from the PRISM 2.0 database indicated that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may turtles and pangolins more resemble humans than bats. ACE2 site 41 residue is tyrosine in pangolin, turtle, and human, but histidine in bat; tyrosine may possess higher affinity for RBD than histidine. Clinical ImplicationsStudying the evolutionary relationship of the RBD of the spike protein of SARS- CoV-2 is useful in determining possible intermediate hosts . This method may facilitate finding reservoirs of SARS-CoV2 and future viral pandemics. Limitations The authors noted that the spike protein crystallization of SARS-CoV-2 was ana - lyzed urgently.

Nature Communications March 27, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9 Purpose To determine cell type susceptibility, entry receptor, entry pathway, protease priming mechanisms, and serological specificity of SARS-CoV-2. Study design Observational study Level of evidenceNot applicable Methods Pseudovirions produced by co-transfection 293T cells with plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 HEK stably expressing hACE2 (293/hACE2) were pretreated with lysosomotropic agents or cathepsin inoculated with pseudovirions. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity measured to determine entry into the cell. SARS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S, and VSV G pseudovirons (control) were with rabbit anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 or patient sera. Mixture was added onto 293/hACD2 cells. Cells were lysed and pseudovirus transduction was measured. Findings 293/hACE2 cells were highly transduced by SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions, indicating 5-kinase (PIKfyve) apili SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions via endocytosis to 293/hACE2 cells. Cathepsin L inhibitors decreased entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions by over 76%, suggest - ing it is essential for SARS-CoV-2 S priming. Type II membrane serine proteases-mediated cleavage activated fusion potential of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in 293/hACE2 cells. Trypsin could activate SARS- CoV-2 S protein efficiently but was not necessary for SARS-CoV-2 S protein to trigger syncytium formation. SARS-CoV-2 S protein was less stable than SARS-CoV-S protein, requiring shorter time and lower temperature to be inactivated. Anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 recognized SARS-CoV-2 S protein. A binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to rabbit anti-SARS S1 antibody T62 was de - tected. Substitution of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV RBD increased the affinity of S protein to polyclonal antibodies T62 suggesting differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs. Serum from recovered SARS patient demonstrated strong inhibition on transduction by SARS-CoV S pseudovirions and modest neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. Sera from all five COVID-19 patients neutralized SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions but had no effect on transduction SARS-CoV S pseudovirions. Clinical ImplicationsEntry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions into 293/hACE2 cells was reduced by preincubation of soluble hACE2; soluble hACE2 may be a viable therapeutic inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection . Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirion entry by lysosomotropic agents suggested that PIKfyve should be considered as a potential drug target . Due to only moderate cross-neutral - ization between covalescent sera of SARS and COVID-19 patients, those previously recovered from SARS-CoV infection may not be protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Limitations Involvement of additional endogenous proteases in HEK293T cell syncytium formation and mechanism of entry into other cell types requires further research. Further characterization of the differences between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD should be ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal in the prefusion confor - mation. Daniel Wrapp et al. Science March 13, 2020 DOI: 10.1126/science.abb2507 Purpose To facilitate vaccine formulation and identification of drug targets against COVID-19 (2019-nCoV), the CoV spike (S) glycoprotein was characterized and com - pared to the S glycoprotein of various other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV. Study design Observational study Level of evidenceNot applicable Methods 2019-nCoV S protein was compared to several other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV S, in protein sequence, orientation of receptor binding domains (RBD) by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), binding affinity for angiotensin-converting (ACE2), and cross reactivity of four published anti-SARS-CoV S protein antibodies against 2019-nCoV S protein by biolayer interferometry (BLI). Findings Cryo-Em demonstrated that structure, orientation, and binding movement of 2019- nCoV S protein overlapped strongly with SARS and MERS-CoV S protein. Amino acid sequence of 2019-nCoV S protein was 98% shared between bat coronavirus RaTG13 (SARS-CoV S protein shared sequence was not reported). Of note, a gain of function mutation in 2019-nCoV S protein leads to RRAR furin recognition site, allowing protease cleavage and potentially enhanced virulence. Similar mutations are seen in hemagglutinin of highly virulent strains of influenza. Binding orienta - tion of S protein to ACE2 was preserved across the viruses and revealed a 10-20- fold higher affinity in 2019-nCoV S protein compared to SARS. To investigate if im - munity to SARS-CoV could contribute to immunity to COVID-19, authors assessed binding of four published anti-SARS S protein antibodies to 2019-nCoV S protein. No binding was detected between anti-SARS antibodies and COVID-19 antigens. Clinical ImplicationsEnhanced affinity for fusion and entry may contribute to COVID-19 virus's capaci - ty to spread rapidly and make S protein-ACE2 binding a potential pharmacologic target. Previous infection with SARS-CoV does not necessarily confer immunity to Covid-19. Limitations Analysis of additional antigens and population-level epidemiological studies are needed to assess the shared immunity of various coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, with COVID-19.BIOLOGYReview by Luke McCormack, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubStructure of Mpro from COVID-19 virus and discovery of its inhibi - tors. Zhenming Jin et al.

Study design Observational study Level of evidenceNot applicable Methods COVID-19 protease Mpro underwent Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) assay to determine efficiency. Kinetic analysis was used to assess the bind - ing affinity of Mpro inhibitor \"N3\" , showing inhibition and antiviral activity in animal models against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, to COVID-19 Mpro. Structure analysis of the N3-Mpro complex identified binding characteristics of N3, identifying potential coronavirus drug targets that may bind and inhibit Mpro in a similar manner. Mea - sured effects of various compounds on COVID-19 Mpro enzyme kinetics. Findings COVID-19 Mpro had slightly increased efficiency to SARS-CoV Mpro. Potent, irreversible inhibition Mpro inhibitor \"N3\" , to which other potential drug candidates were compared. Vir - tual screening of potential Mpro inhibitors that also bind to the substrate binding pocket identified Cinanserin, a serotonin antagonist from the 1960's, with potential for optimizing as an anti-viral drug. Screening of ~10,000 compounds using FRET yielded six FDA-approved a framework for systematically identifying poten - tial drug candidates targeting COVID-19 Mpro that already underwent clinical trials for safety. This same framework can be applied in future pandemics needing rapid and novel drug development. Limitations While this methodology rapidly provides potential pharmacological therapies with well-theorized anti-microbial mechanisms, it lacks in-vivo data that animal models may provide.BIOLOGYReview by Luke McCormack, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubStructure of the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase from COVID-19 Virus Yan Gao et al. Science April 10, 2020 DOI: 10.1126/science.abb7498 Purpose To determine the molecular structure of the COVID-19 RNA-dependent RNA poly - merase (RdRp or nsp12) and nonstructural proteins nsp7 and nsp8. Study design Structural analysis comparison Level of evidenceNot applicable Methods COVID-19 RdRp gene was cloned into a plasmid vector and then transformed into Escherichia coli. Proteins were purified via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography and again via Hitrap Q ion-exchange column. RdRp-nsp7-nsp-8 complex was stabilized and assembled at a molar ratio of 1:2:2.The architecture of the COVID-19 virus RdRp- nsp7-nsp8 complex was elucidated via cryogenic electron microscopy. Findings The structure of the COVID-19 virus RdRp-nsp7-nsp8 complex is similar to SARS-CoV with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) value of 0.82 for 1,078 C-alpha atoms. Key distinguishing features of COVID-19 include additional residues A4-R118 in the NiRAN domain, and residues N215-D218 form a -strand in COVID-19 virus RdRp providing additional conformational stability. COVID-19 virus RdRp has the highest similarity with the Apo state of hepatitis C virus (HCV) ns5b, providing context to comparative analysis between the potential mechanism of remdesivir and the known mechanism of sofosbuvir. COVID-19 RdRp domain adopts the conserved architecture of the viral polymerase family consisting of a finger (residues L366-A581 and K621-G679), palm (residues T582-P620 and T680-Q815), and thumb (residues H816-E920) domain. The active site of the COVID-19 virus RdRp is in the finger domain via motifs A-F. Clinical ImplicationsCOVID-19 RdRp is considered a primary target for chain terminating nucleotide analog antiviral inhibitors including remdesivir. Such findings serve to inform phar - maceutical design in efforts to produce effective drugs and vaccines against COVID-19. Limitations Cryogenic electron microscopy failed to map the S1-D3 and G897-D901 residues of COVID-19 virus RdRp. The study models a potential molecular interaction of COVID-19 motifs and remdesivir after the molecular interactions of HCV and sofosbuvir. While there are similarities between the mechanisms of the chain terminating nucleotide analog antiviral inhibitors, and while the model is theoretical in nature, there are lim - itations to what can be extrapolated from comparative analysis.BIOLOGYReview by Ndubisi Onah, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubIs low alveolar type II cell SOD3 in the lungs of elderly linked to the observed severity of COVID-19? Ahmed Abouhashem et al. Antioxidants and Redox Signaling April 23, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2020.8111 Purpose To compare type II alveolar cell RNA sequencing data between elderly and young healthy subjects to further understand age differences in COVID-19 presentations. Study design Case series (n = 4) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Human lung single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 4 healthy donors were divided into the \"old-age group\" (57 and 63 years-old) and the \"young-age group\" (22 and 29-years-old). Using expression atlas of human primary cells, alve - olar type II pneumocytes were isolated from the mixed cell populations. Genes of this alveolar type II cell cluster were assessed for differential expression as a func - tion of aging. Findings Expression of which enables SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, in the alveolar type II cells were comparable between old and young donors. Super - oxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) was the most downregulated in the old-age group, along with downregulation of other redox-based genes including activating transcription factor metallothionein 2A (M2TA) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1). 24 ATF4 downstream factors were significantly downregulated in alve - olar type II cells of the elderly. Gene regulator database analysis suggested older patients' ability to respond to heme deficiency and the ATF4-dependent ability to respond to ER oxidative stress is significantly compromised. Clinical ImplicationsCOVID-19 produces oxidative stress within the lungs, and older patients displayed reduced redox gene expression relative to two younger patients. This data, in combination with evidence that superoxide dismutase (SOD) can decrease severity of respiratory illnesses, warrants further investigation of therapies focused on reducing the oxidative stress on type II pneumocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Limitations A small sample, low powered case series with 4 COVID19-free participants.BIOLOGYReview by Jackie Urban, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubVisualizing speech-generated oral fluid droplets with laser light scat - tering. Philip Anfinrud et al. New England Journal of Medicine April 15, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc2007800 Purpose To demonstrate aerosol expulsion of normal speech with and without a face cover. Study design Observational study Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods A laser source was set up in order to visualize droplets from people speaking the phrase \"stay healthy\" . The speaker was given a slightly damp cloth face mask, and repeated the phrase with the mask and without, at three different volumes each time. The aerosol spray was recorded with a camera and analyzed. Findings The act of speaking generates oral droplets and most droplets were visualized when the voiceless dental fricative (\"th\" sound) was made. The droplets ranged from 20- 500 \u00b5m in size. Large droplets fall quickly to the ground whereas small droplets behave like an aerosol, which further expands the distance and spread of infectious particles. The presence of a slightly damp face mask significantly reduced the number of drop - lets emitted by the speaker. Clinical ImplicationsViral agents transmit from human to human through speech and viral aerosol spread can be mitigated by mask usage . Limitations The study was limited by its small sample size (6 different conditions, with a limited number of repetitions per trial). Furthermore, this is not a true laser-light scattering experiment, despite the title\u2014the analysis of the light scattering data was not de - scribed, and there was no mention of how they arrived at the 20-500 \u00b5m size-scale of the droplets. Studies of light scattering are often impeded by dust, and the HEPA filter may not have adequately filtered the air within the cardboard box in which they made their measurements. Some of the flashes representing speech droplets were streaked suggesting that the rate of 60 frames per second was insufficient to freeze the motion of the droplets. The size detection limit for observed particles was not stated, and if particles <10\u00b5m evaded their image analysis scheme, it could have detrimental im - plications for the applicability of their study, since the lung passageways most readily absorb particles smaller than that threshold. Additionally, it was unclear why authors didn't test a dry facemask, or why they didn't test more phrases corresponding to a broader range of the phonemes in the English language.BIOLOGYReview by Khatcher O. Margossian, MS Table of ClubA conserved epitope in the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Men Yuan et al. Science April 3, 2020 DOI: 10.1126/science.abb7269 Purpose To analyze the ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and an anti- SARS-CoV S-protein antibody with SARS-CoV-2. Study design Original molecular biology investigation Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods CR3022, a neutralizing antibody targeting was SARS- CoV-2 S-protein RBD. Authors assessed this complex's structure and binding affinity to find out conserved vs divergent RBD sequences affecting binding of CR3022 on these S-proteins. Ability of CR3022 to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 was assessed via in vitro by microneutralization assay. ELISA assessed interaction of CR3022 and m396, another SARS-CoV antibody, with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Findings As revealed by structural studies, CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. - activity CR3022 than CoV-2 (Kd=115 nM). Authors attributed this to an additional N-glycosylation site on CoV- 2 RBD. While CR3022 does not block ACE2 binding of RBD, its epitope is only exposed when RBDs are in their \"up\" conformation allowing them to bind to ACE2. This suggests a different mechanism of suppression besides blocking cell entry via ACE2. In-vitro microneutralization assay failed to show any neutralization of CoV-2 at the highest concentration CR3022 tested (400 g/ml). ELISA confirmed CR3022 does interact with CoV-2 and demonstrated a higher binding signal compared to m396 antibody. Clinical ImplicationsDespite binding both CoV and CoV-2, immunity conferred by anti-SARS-CoV RBD antibodies is not robust. Other targets should be considered for vaccine and drug development against coronaviruses broadly and COVID-19 specifically. Limitations This study did not assess possible synergistic effects of CR3022 with other known anti-RBD antibodies in-vitro, nor did they investigate in-vivo effects against CoV-2. Authors cite numerous examples of antibodies against coronaviruses, influenza A, herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus and others which confer in-vivo protection while failing in-vitro neutralization. Additionally, further investigation of other con - served CoV epitopes are needed for coronavirus vaccine development.BIOLOGYReview by Luke McCormack, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEPIDEMIOLOGYTable of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEpidemiology and clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 in children Soo-Han Choi et al. Clinical and Experimental Pediatrics April 6, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3345/cep.2020.00535 Purpose To summarize the incidence and most common presenting symptoms in children/ adolescents with COVID-19, and to discuss the potentialof 2019-nCoV transmission in pregnant mothers and newborns. Study design Systematic Review Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods This paper reviewed selected pediatric cases of 2019-nCoV worldwide, summariz - ing findings from prospective and retrospective studies of pediatric cohorts. Findings The limited data on the infection rate of 2019-nCoV in children, due to the lack of pediatric testing, shows that children's symptoms are often mild, but some cases may progress to severe disease. Of all COVID-19 cases in the studied popu - lations, pediatric cases comprise 0.6-5.2%. The clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV in children are most commonly fever, cough, and fatigue along with rhinor - rhea, diarrhea, and headache. In studies of 31 COVID-19 positive pregnant wom - en, 29 had C-sections, 11 infants experienced fetal distress, 1 infant was stillborn, and 1 infant died after birth. To date, there have been no reports of the vertical transmission of COVID-19. However, a small number of neonatal COVID-19 diag - noses have been reported independent of maternal infections. Clinical ImplicationsTransmission of 2019-nCoV in children primarily occurs through contact with adult patients, mainly through household exposure. Prolonged detection of viral RNA in throat swabs and feces suggests that children may transmit the virus to others in the community. While infected neonates had mild symptoms, special precautions including hand hygiene must be taken by individuals in close contact with newborns. Limitations This study only included data through March 12th. Due to lack of testing capability, it is unclear how long infected children are contagious. Studies of pregnant moth - ers and newborns had small sample sizes, only observed third trimester mothers, and were disproportionately C-section cases. Further research is needed to assess the possibility of vertical transmission.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Alice Burgess, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubComparison of Hospitalized Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Caused by COVID-19 and H1N1 Xiao Tang et al. Chest March 26, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.032 Purpose To compare clinical presentation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 and H1N1 patients Study design Retrospective case-control ( n = 148) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Retrospective case-control study of COVID-19 positive patients with ARDS (n=73, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, 12/2019-02/2020) compared with H1N1 (n=75, Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, 03/2016-12/2019). Findings All differences in patient characteristics listed below were statistically significant. Median age is higher in COVID-19 (67 years) vs H1N1 (52 years) Septic shock more prevalent in COVID-19 (31.5%) vs H1N1 (13.3%) Lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score in COVID-19 (2, 11) vs H1N1 (5, 14) Median PaO2/FIO2 in COVID-19 was higher (198.2 mm Hg) vs H1N1 (107.0 mm Hg) Greater proportion of patients with PMHx of cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 (31.5%) vs H1N1 (10.7%) SOFA adjusted mortality greater in H1N1 than COVID-19 (rate ratio=2.009) Clinical implicationsCOVID-19 patients were more likely to exhibit constitutional symptoms such as fa - tigue and diarrhea. Ground-glass opacities on imaging were more common in COVID-19 patients compared to consolidation in H1N1 patients. ARDS is accompanied by fibromyx - oid exudates in COVID-19 , whereas H1N1 is accompanied by necrotizing bronchiolitis and extensive hemorrhage. Prior data suggest that glucocorticoid use in treating MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV has increased morbidity and mortality. Steroid use in COVID-19 patients should be carefully considered . Limitations Retrospective study including data from two independent single-center cohorts may introduce bias. The patients of the H1N1 cohort were more clinically ill than the COVID-19 cohort. A large proportion of the COVID-19 cohort (35.6%) were still hospitalized at time of manuscript writing, possibly leading to underestimation of COVID-19 mortality rate. Data from H1N1 cohort was gathered from a longer time period than COVID-19 cohort, which may have affected results and analysis. Therefore, continued follow-up on this cohort and studies conducting longer follow-up are necessary.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Bryant Yu, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubThe reproductive number of COVID-19 is higher compared to SARS coronavirus Yuanyuan Liu et al. Journal of Travel Medicine February 13, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taaa021 Purpose To compare the basic reproduction number (R0) of the COVID 19 virus to the SARS coronavirus. Study design Systematic Review Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods PubMed, bioRxiv and Google Scholar were searched for eligible studies between January 1st 2020 to February 7th 2020 with the search terms \"coronavirus & basic reproduction number\" . The basic reproduction number is a tool used to gauge the transmissibility of a virus and is expressed as a positive number. An R0 > 1 will indi - cate that a virus is spreading and will likely increase in transmission, whereas a R0 < 1indicated that the virus is decreasing transmission and will likely die out. Findings The search results found 12 studies that qualified by reporting a calculated basic reproduction number. The authors found that the calculated R0 in these 12 stud - ies ranged from 1.40 to 6.49, with a mean of 3.28 and a median of 2.79 . The authors note that there was a temporal change in the estimated R0 value, ith lower levels in early January and increasing as the disease spread. Clinical ImplicationsThe R0 calculated in this study was considerably higher than the WHO esti - mates, indicating that the disease may transmit at a faster rate than previ - ously estimated . The estimated COVID-19 R0 from these studies falls between the published R0 for SARS (between 2 and 5). However, COVID-19 is already more widespread than SARS, suggesting that it is more transmissible than these estima - tions would suggest. Limitations The studies reviewed used three distinct modeling techniques that yielded differ - ent calculated basic reproduction numbers, though the differences were not sta - tistically significant. Future studies will need to track this value using standardized assumptions to better understand transmissibility. Additionally, future studies need to assess the WHO estimation of the basic reproduction number relative to these new results to resolve this discrepancy.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Conor Flavin, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubAre patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection? Lei Fang et al. Lancet: Respiratory Medicine March 11, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30116-8 Purpose To explore the theory that comorbidities, specifically hypertension and diabetes, put individuals at greater risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Study design Systematic Review Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods The authors reviewed three studies demonstrating increased incidence among severe COVID-19 disease in patients with hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Findings The first study found that of 32 non-survivors from a group of 52 intensive care unit patients, 22% had cerebrovascular disease and 22% had diabetes (RR 1.34 and 1.78, respectively). In the second study, 173 patients with severe disease were found to have comorbidities of HTN (23.7%), DM (16.2%), coronary heart diseases (5.8%), and cerebrovascular disease (2.3%). By contrast, the third study observed comorbidities in all hospitalized patients (total of 140), regardless of COVID severity, with HTN and DM being the most prevalent at 30% and 12% respectively. Clinical ImplicationsHuman pathogenic coronaviruses bind to bound angiotensin-con - verting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on endothelial cells expressed in epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels. So far, evidence suggests COVID-19 uses the same mechanism. Individuals with hypertension and diabe - tes are commonly treated with ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which lead to of ACE2 receptors. ACE2 receptor polymor - phisms have been linked to diabetes and hypertension. With this understanding, the article proposes a hypothesis for the increase risk of severe disease in this patient population. Limitations Only three studies were reviewed. It was not noted whether patients with severe disease and comorbid hypertension or diabetes were being treated with ACE-in - hibitors or ARBs. Future research could address patient medications in addition to comorbid conditions, as well as genetic testing to determine the existence of a possible link between polymorphisms of ACE2 receptor and severe disease.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Joseph Dodson, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubFirst-wave COVID-19 transmissibility and severity in China outside Hubei after control measures, and second-wave scenario planning: A modelling impact assessment. Kathy Leung et al. Lancet April 8, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30746-7 Purpose To review the impact and transmissibility of COVID-19 during the early cases of Hubei province (original epicenter) in China. Study design Retrospective analysis Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods The authors used publicly available data from four major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhem, and Wenzhou) to determine reproduction number (Rt) and confirmed case fatality rate (cCFR). Furthermore, they also incorporated susceptible-infec - tious-recovery models to assess what role relaxing intervention (social distancing, community shutdowns, etc.) had on spread of virus. Findings Estimates of instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) on weekly intervals were reported between early January and later February 2020. In most provinces the mean Rt decreased after aggressive control measures were implemented, suggesting that reduction in control measures could lead to a resurgence of case numbers. The confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) was estimated to be 0.98% (0.82- 1.16) among the provinces/cities outside Hubei. In comparison the cCFR in Hubei province was 5.91% and Wuhan was 1.4%. Clinical ImplicationsRelaxation of social control measures increased the cumulative case count exponentially proportional to the duration of relaxation. Furthermore, the dura - tion of aggressive control measures must be longer than the duration of attempted relaxation in order to get the Rt below 1.5. Stated differently, allowing Rt to rise when no herd immunity is present will incur health and economic loss even if future aggressive control measures push prevalence of infection back to the previ - ous level during original aggressive control measures. Limitations This study used public data only from provinces that actively reported cases. Cases were likely under-reported due lack of testing and resources. Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 that go undiagnosed would alter the projections of Rt and cCFR. The data obtained did not include specifics regarding exposure or travel history, which could be important to further understanding virus transmission.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Connor Wakefield, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEpidemiology 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease-19 in Gansu Prov - ince, China, 2020 Jingchun Fan et al. Emerging Infectious Diseases March 13, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2606.200251 Purpose To compare the characteristics of COVID-19 positive groups observed during two time periods: January 23 - 28 2020 (early period) and January 29 2020 - February 3 2020 (late period) in Gansu Province. Study design Case control study (n = 54 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Demographic data and exposure history were collected for confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the Gansu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers studied 54 total confirmed cases between January 23rd and February 3rd, 2020. The authors designated cases as primary or secondary. Primary cases had recent travel to Wuhan, and secondary cases had no travel outside the Gansu Province. Findings Of the total cases, 35 were primary and 19 were secondary. Almost two thirds of the early period cases were primary. Early period patients were younger than the late period patients (34 vs 48 years old, p=0.014). More patients in the early period were laborers, compared to the late period where there were more retired patients (p=0.009). There were no significant differences in sex. Clinical ImplicationsThis research shows that social distancing practices are warranted and useful. Pri - mary cases were 3 times greater than secondary cases in the early period compared to the late period. These younger patients were more likely to be laborers, and thus traveled more than their older, retired counterparts diagnosed in the late period. As travel bans were implemented, COVID-19 cases came from community spread. This transition between transmission mechanism demonstrates how the virus can affect patients of any age or occupation, and underscores the importance of mandatory, strict social distancing policies. Limitations This study used a relatively small number of cases observed in a relatively short period of time (i.e., 12 days). Future research in the Gansu Province should obtain information on more cases spanning a longer time frame. This will provide infor - mation about the entire epidemiology of the virus (and the effects of preventative measures) in Gansu Province.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Antonios Skondras, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic population. Daniel Gudbjartsson et al. New England Journal of Medicine April 14, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2006100 Purpose This study was conducted in Iceland for targeted testing of persons at high risk for coronavirus and population screening/stratification of those who tested positive. Study design Cross sectional study Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods Targeted testing was provided for symptomatic persons coming from high risk areas or those who were in contact with infected persons from Jan 31-Mar 31. On March 13 through April 4, population screening was open to anyone who desired testing, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. Nasopharnygeal and oropharyn - geal samples were sent for viral RNA isolation. Persons who tested positive were required to self-quarantine and identify other persons that came into contact with the patient 24 hours prior to symptom onset. Identified close contacts were re - quired to self-quarantine for 2 weeks. Findings Of the 9199 persons who were targeted for testing, 1221 (13.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these people, 65% had recently traveled internationally. Through population screening, positive results were reported for 100 of 13,080 participants (0.8%), of whom 86% had reported recent travel outside the country. Positive test results were reported for 87 of 10,797 persons (0.8%) who accepted the open invi - tation for testing and 13 of 2283 persons (0.6%) who were invited at random. Clinical ImplicationsTowards the end of the study period, the origin of infection has shifted away from international travel to close contact spread of the virus. Overall, the frequency of in - fection in the overall Icelandic population is currently stable, which hints at success of current containment measures implemented by the Icelandic people. Limitations Iceland is a country with a population just over 360,000. Population testing is ap - propriate, but this method lacks external validity in larger countries. In addition, testing in larger countries would not be centralized (tested in a single laboratory). The majority of SARS-CoV-2 identified in this study are of the A2 clade that origi - nated exclusively from Europe, and its characteristics may not apply to other haplo - types of the virus. Further epidemiologic studies needs to be corroborated with the data produced by this study to characterize SARS-CoV-2.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Gary Wu, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubTemporal dynamics in viral shedding and transmissibility of COVID-19. Xi He et al. Nature: Medicine April 15, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0869-5 Purpose To evaluate the viral shedding pattern of COVID-19 and study the periods in which COVID-19 is most transmissible. Study design Observational, retrospective study Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Two-part study with separate clinical and observational groups. In the clinical group, 94 COVID-19 positive patients from Guangzhou Hospital in Guangdong, China received a nasopharyngeal swab during each day of symptoms to evaluate temporal changes in viral load. Patients had laboratory confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR. In the epidemiologic group, 77 pairs of patients who developed COVID-19 were identified to determine the serial interval (time between symptom presenta - tion in infector to symptom presentation in infectee). Case information was gath - ered from publicly available sources in several countries. All infector-infectee pairs were evaluated to ensure that neither party had other contacts who tested positive for COVID-19 or traveled to areas known to have a high number of COVID-19 cases. Findings Viral load was highest on day one of hospitalization and decreased in a linear fash - ion. Mean serial interval was noted to be 5.8 days, and when taken with a noted incubation period of 5.2 days, COVID-19 infectiousness was noted to begin 2.3 days prior to symptom presentation and peak 0.7 days prior to symptom pre - sentation. Authors estimate that 44% of patients were infected with COVID-19 by a carrier who was asymptomatic at the time of transmission Clinical ImplicationsViral load was highest on day of COVID-19 diagnosis and decreased linearly. 44% of patients were suspected of contracting COVID-19 from an asymptom - atic carrier. Limitations Patient pair data in the epidemiologic group was collected by governmental agen - cy reports or via media, this data is possibly inaccurate or incomplete. Cases in this group were not stratified by age, gender, country, or disease severity. Treatments for the clinical group were given according to national health guidelines, and could have affected viral load testing by RT-PCR. Recall bias was likely present in the epi - demiologic group and may have altered incubation period length.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Steven Heidt, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubHospitalization Rates and Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized with Laboratory-Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 - COVID-NET, 14 States, March 1-30, 2020 Shikha Garg et al. CDC: Mordibity and Mortality Weekly Report April 17, 2020 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e3 Purpose To conduct a population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-as - sociated hospitalizations in the US. Study design Retrospective cross-sectional study (n = 1482 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Data included from 1482 hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, representing 14 states and 90 counties. Study included only the resi - dents of a designated COVID-NET catchment area and hospitalized within 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Findings Overall, a high proportion of US patients hospitalized with COVID are older (74.5% were aged 50 years) and have underlying medical conditions includ - ing hypertension (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%). It is therefore imperative to implement preventative measures to especially protect elderly population and those with underlying medical conditions. Among 580 COVID-19 patients with race/ethnicity data, 45% were non-Hispanic white, 33.1% were non-Hispanic blacks, 8.1% were Hispanic, 5.5 were Asian, 0.3% were American Indian/Alaskan Native, 7.9% were unknown. No statistical analysis between groups were performed, but of note, the COVID-NET catchment general population are 59% non-Hispanic white and 18% non-Hispanic black, suggesting the non-Hispanic black population is disproportionally affected by SARS-CoV-2. Clinical ImplicationsElderly patients with underlying medical conditions are most susceptible to COVID-19 disease and have the worst outcomes Limitations This study included preliminary results from the first month of US surveillance of COVID-19 and are subject to change as more patients are diagnosed and evaluated. Additionally, patients in this study represented a wide variety of care facilities. With - out standardization of diagnostic testing practices for SARS-CoV-2, under-identifi - cation of COVID-19 cases is likely.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Elena Perkins, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEpidemiology of COVID-19 among children in China Yuanyuan Dong et al. Pediatrics March 13, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-0702 Purpose To evaluate the epidemiological characteristics and transmission trends of pediatric patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China. Study design Observational study Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Researchers collected data on reported COVID-19 pediatric cases from January 16, 2020 to February 8, 2020. Cases were defined as having high, medium, or low risk based on patient exposure to a COVID-19 patient and proximity to endemic areas. Sus - pected cases were identified if a child at high risk had 2 of the following: clinical symp - toms, elevated white blood cell count or CRP , or abnormal chest radiograph. Suspected cases were confirmed by positive RT-PCR nasal swab or blood samples, or by genetic sequencing of respiratory tract or blood samples. Findings Among 2135 patients, 728 (34.1%) were confirmed cases and 1407 (65.9%) were sus - pected cases. The median age was 7, and complete age range was 1 day to 18 years. Nearly half of total cases were from Hubei province (46.0%), and another 18.5% from surrounding provinces. Of both suspected and confirmed cases, 94 (4.4%), 1088 (51.0%), 826 (38.7%), and 125 (5.8%) cases were diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe/critical, respectively. One child died. Compared to adults, there were less severe and critical cases in children (5.8% vs 18.5%). T he proportions of severe and critical cases in the pediatric population was highest in infants (10.6%). Clinical ImplicationsChildren might be less affected by COVID-19 because the maturity and functioning of ACE-2 in children is lower than adults. They may experience coronavirus infections more frequently and develop cross reacting antibodies, or their immune systems are less developed and therefore have less severe immune responses. The highest pro - portion of critical and severe pediatric COVID-19 cases was in infants less than 1 year old . Limitations The study was unable to assess clinical characteristics or incubation period due to lack of data at the time of analysis. There were more severe and critical cases in the suspected than confirmed group, suggesting that some suspected cases may be due to other respiratory infections besides COVID-19. Further research containing more detailed patient information and clinical outcomes is needed.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Grace Alexander, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubThe epidemiology and pathogenesis disease Hussin Rothan & Journal of Autoimmunity February 26, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102433 Purpose To summarize recent findings regarding the symptoms, epidemiology, transmis - sion, pathogenesis, and future directions of treating/preventing COVID-19. Study design Systematic review Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Reviewed information from COVID-19 case reports and cohort studies. Findings Viruses in the Coronaviridae family generally presents with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. Distinct symptoms for COVID-19 include rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat, and diarrhea. Elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, D-dimer, and cytokines and chemokines are generally observed, with severe cases correlating with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Transmission occurs primarily via direct contact of virus particles with mucus membranes. Lung epithe - lial cells appear to be the primary target of the virus, and binding occurs between the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. Of note, the sequence of the receptor-binding domain of COVID-19 spike protein is similar to that of SARS-CoV, which also binds to the ACE2 receptor. Pre-existing drugs including Oseltamivir, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, and Ganciclovir could prove useful in treating COVID-19 patients, as well as Remdesivir and Chloroquine. The EIDD-2801 compound (an isopropylester prodrug of a ribo - nucleoside analog that has shown anti-influenza virus activity in cultured cells and mice), has potential to target seasonal and pandemic viruses. Clinical ImplicationsCorrelation between cytokines and disease severity can be used to predict progno - sis, and hopefully prevent adverse outcomes. There is further need for investigation of alternative (fecal oral) routes of transmission, and investigation of pre-existing antiviral drugs as treatment modalities for COVID-19. Limitations The authors discuss the need to make more testing available in order to further understand the pathogenesis and spread; to study pediatric populations, who have been under-diagnosed; to investigate the vast range of clinical presentations, from virtually asymptomatic ranging to critical condition; and to further research poten - tial viral targets for pharmacologic therapies.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Alice Burgess, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubMathematical Model Of Infection Kinetics And Its Analysis For COVID-19, SARS And MERS. Kaihao Liang Infection, Genetics and Evolution April 8, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104306 Purpose To discuss the spread rules of the three coronavirus epidemics and pandemic: COVID-19, SARS and MERS. A propagation growth model was established using growth rate and inhibition constant of infectious diseases with the parameters of the three coronavirus transmission growth models obtained by nonlinear fitting. Study design Statistical analysis Level of evidenceNot applicable Methods Data on COVID-19 cases were obtained from Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan. Data on SARS cases collected using China's National data, as well as data from Guangdong, Beijing, Hong Kong. Data from MERS cases analyzed from Saudi Arabia database on 4 distinct cycles of MERS outbreaks. Model hypothesis can be simpli - fied as: r(N) = r0 - s*N, where N = # of infected, r(N) = the growth rate as a function of # of people, r0 = constant indicating growth in the case of no preventative mea - sures, s = infection inhibition coefficient (reflecting control/prevention measures). Findings The multiplication cycles of SARS and MERS are similar, ranging from 5 to 10 days. The multiplication cycle of COVID-19 is only two to three days , and the number of cases of COVID-19 will increase rapidly under the effect of exponential growth. In Hubei, the infection inhibition constant of COVID-19 is 3.58 \u00d7 1e-6 , two orders of magnitude lower than in Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Henan. Clinical ImplicationsThe growth rate of COVID-19 is about twice that of SARS and MERS, and the COVID-19 doubling cycle is two to three days, suggesting that the number of COVID-19 patients would double in two to three days without human inter - vention. COVID-19 spread rapidly in Hubei due to the large number of patients in the early stage, as medical institutions dealt with the shortage of hospital beds, equipment, medicine, masks, and protective clothing, resulting in the inability to effectively isolate patients. This led to a lower infection inhibition constant in Hubei. Limitations This type of modeling seems to have the most use in retrospectively analyzing the pandemic response based on region but may be of more limited use in prospective modeling.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Travis Tran, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubUniversal Screening for SARS-CoV-2 in Women Admitted for Delivery Desmond Sutton et al. New England Journal of Medicine April 13, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc2009316 Purpose To investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 amongst pregnant patients upon de - livery, as a vast majority of patients are asymptomatic. Study design Cross-sectional study (n = 215) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Between March 22 - April 4, 2020, a total of 215 pregnant women delivered infants at the New York-Presbyterian Allen Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medi - cal Center, and all were screened on admission for COVID-19 with quantitative PCR. Findings Four women (1.9%) had fever or other symptoms on admission, and all 4 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 211 women without symptoms, all were afebrile on admission. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 210 of the 211 women (99.5%) who did not have symptoms of Covid-19; of these women, 29 (13.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, 29 of the 33 (87.9%) COVID-19-posi - tive patients were asymptomatic at presentation. Clinical ImplicationsThe use of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in all pregnant patients presenting for delivery revealed that at this point in the pandemic in New York City, most of the patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery were asymptomatic. More than one of every eight asymptomatic patients who were admitted to the labor and delivery unit were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although this prevalence may not apply to geographic regions with lower rates of infection, it highlights the hid - den prevalence of COVID-19 among asymptomatic obstetrical patients. Universal screening for the pregnant population gives the health system the opportunity to protect mothers, babies, and health care teams as the pandemic continues. Limitations The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection may also be underreported because of false negative results of COVID-19 tests. Given the test's relatively weak sensitivity, future research is needed to understand how patients' COVID-19 status from RT- PCR should best be used to determine hospital isolation practices and bed assign - ments, inform neonatal care, and guide the use of PPE.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Alice Burgess, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubDuration for carrying SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients. Xinwei Du et al. Journal of Infection April 10, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.053 Purpose To evaluate the duration of carrier status for SARS-CoV-2. Study design Case series (n = 161) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods From January 20, 2020 to March 1, 2020, inpatients in Henan province (China) with a specific SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological history and a positive nucleic acid test were identified for data collection. The duration of carrier status was defined as the time from a close contact with the source of infection to the last positive test for nucleic acid. Then, duration of carrying SARS-CoV-2 in different ages, gender, and disease condition were compared. Findings Patients were contagious at all stages of disease with median carrying duration of 26 days and longest up to 50 days. There was statistically significantly longer carrying duration based on condition and age, with longer duration seen in older age and with severe COVID-19 cases. Duration for carrying SARS-CoV-2 has nothing to do with gender. However, it is related to the age of patients. The median duration in the 60 years-old group was 28 days vs 20 days in the 0-59 years-old group (P<0.01). Clinical ImplicationsPersistent infection in elderly patients may be the initiating factor that causes or - gan damage, especially persistent inflammation of the alveoli, and disease progres - sion. The long infectious duration of SARS-CoV-2 in patients means that early, purposeful isolation and monitoring are necessary to prevent further spread. Limitations Limited by sample size, as well as by single location study. Additionally, carrying duration definition could be influenced by recall bias.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Bryant Yu, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEvolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei province, China: a descriptive and mod - elling study Juanjuan Zhang et al. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases April 2, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30230-9 Purpose Characterization of epidemiologic qualities of COVID-19 outside of Hubei province, China fifty days after first noted case outside of the region. Study design Retrospective, observational study (n = 8579) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Information on laboratory positive COVID-19 patients outside of Hubei province, China was collected from national, provincial, and municipal databases as well as from media reports. Cases were divided into two groups based on date of symptom onset: December 24-January 27 and January 28-February 17. Case grouping was based on fourth revision of COVID-19 case definition. In comparing the two groups, authors analyzed differences in case demographics and time-to-event intervals, such as time to hospitalization. Incubation period and serial interval were identified from subsets of the study sample. Findings As the epidemic progressed, time to hospitalization and time to first healthcare consultation decreased; specifically, time to hospitalization fell from 4.4 days in the first period to 2.6 days in the second period (P<0.0001). Incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days from 49 individuals via contact tracing. Serial interval was es - timated at 5.1 days from 28 index cases and 35 secondary cases. Net reproduction number differed between provinces and cities, ranging from 1.08 to 1.71 in areas under study. Reproduction number in all studied areas fell below 1 at the end of January 2020, indicating that disease did not spread in the community anymore. Clinical ImplicationsIsolation measures have an effect on healthcare ascertainment, and epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 are varied outside of Hubei province. Limitations Data were collected from governmental databases and media reports, though the authors did validate their cases by examining the official line lists for cities and provinces for which reproduction number was calculated. Study data were collect - ed during an infectious disease outbreak and therefore are subject to non-homog - enous sampling and case ascertainment bias.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Steven Heidt, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubThe impact of nutrition on COVID-19 susceptibility and long-term consequences.

Brain, Behavior, and Immunity April 18, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.040 Purpose To discuss the relationships between diet/nutrition, social determinants of health, and COVID-19 outcomes. Study design Systematic review Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods Reviewed and summarized findings from studies on health equity, nutrition and inflam - mation, obesity, and disease complications following viral illnesses. Findings COVID-19 mortality disproportionately affects the elderly, minorities (black and Hispanic populations), and in those with co-morbid medical conditions. Obesity and type 2 di - abetes (DM), two prominent risk factors for severe COVID-19, may underlie this dispro - portionate effect. Minorities have higher rates of poverty and less access to health care, meaning decreased access to healthy foods and nutritional education. Additionally, DM and obesity are driven by the prevalence of the Western diet, comprised of high amounts of saturated fat, refined carbohydrates/sugars, and low levels of fiber, unsaturated fats, and antioxidants. The western diet chronically activates the innate immune system and inhibits the adaptive immune system. High amounts of saturated fat may lead to in - creased macrophage infiltration to lung tissue, highly relevant to COVID cases given the pneumonia many patients develop. Saturated fat-induced oxidative stress impairs T and B cell proliferation and maturation, and induces B cell apoptosis, which contributes to B cell immunosuppression. Aside from known lung damage following COVID-19, there could be a potential for persistent neuro-inflammatory responses to trigger neurodegenerative dis - eases, like Alzheimer's Disease and other forms of dementia. Studies show that consuming healthy foods has anti-inflammatory effects, even in the presence of obesity pathology. Clinical ImplicationsWider access to healthy foods is crucial to protecting vulnerable populations from COVID-19. A person's underlying health is predictive of disease susceptibility \u2014 not just to COVID-19 but to a wide variety of illnesses and infectious diseases. Physicians need to educate their elderly and minority patients on the relationship between nutrition and inflammation, and help connect them to community resources. Limitations More research is needed to investigate long-term effects from COVID-19, as lifestyle relat - ed co-morbidities in these patients could confer an increased risk for dementia and de - generative disease. Many studies referenced looked at the inflammatory responses in mice models as opposed to humans, limiting generalizability.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Alice Burgess, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubAsymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in household contacts of a healthcare provider, Wuhan, China. Yi Luo et al. Emerging Infectious Diseases April 24, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2608.200282 Purpose To evaluate the case of a physician with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 and their household contacts in Wuhan, China. Study design Case series (n = 6) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods The patient (patient 1) was a 39-year-old nephrologist at the Central Hospital of Wuhan. The patient's five household members included were his wife (contact 1), a 37-year-old laboratory scientist, 7-year-old fraternal twins (contacts 2 & 3), a 62-year- old retired grandfather who was a current smoker (contact 4), and a retired 64-year-old grandmother in good health (contact 5). All household contacts underwent CT scans, and then daily throat swabs for qRT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the the obser - vation period: February 11th-March 1st, 2020. Blood was taken for laboratory tests: C-reactive protein, leukocyte count, (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and D-Dimer. Findings All household contacts of patient 1 had qRT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and were asymptomatic throughout the observation period. Stool specimens for contacts 1, 2, and 3 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Contact 2 tested negative on 4 consecutive throat swab PCRs but had a positive stool specimen for SARS-CoV-2. Contact 1 was positive for SARS-CoV-2 on qRT-PCR tests of multiple serial throat swabs but negative on IgM and IgG tests. Contact 1 underwent 11 serial throat swabs and on 2 separate occasions, she had 2 consecutive negative results for SARS-CoV-2 only to revert to having a throat swab specimen positive for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical ImplicationsData about the incidence of asymptomatic infection in families of healthcare workers can help to construct a more informed public health response during the pandemic. There may be underestimation of positive cases, as this study illustrated negative qRT-PCR tests that subsequently tested positive. Studies on serial testing on as - ymptomatic patients with a negative test should be conducted to see if they are truly negative. More research on fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary, as three household contacts in this study had positive stool specimens. Limitations This study was limited by its small sample size, as it focused on asymptomatic trans - mission amongst household contacts of a healthcare provider.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Antonios Skondras, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal Club High contagiousness and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Steven Sanche et al. Emerging Infectious Diseases April 7, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2607.200282 Purpose To estimate key epidemiological parameters of the early outbreak of 2019 novel coronavi - rus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan. Study design Case series (n= 140) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods 140 case reports from across China were collected from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and provincial health commissions between January 15-30, 2020. Two models were developed to estimate the growth rate of the outbreak in Wuhan. First arrival model: domestic travel data from Baidu Migration server was used to compute the likelihood of arrival times of first known cases in provinces outside of Hubei, as a function of the rate of epidemic growth in Wuhan. Case count model: a hybrid deter - ministic-stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was used to account for additional persons infected in Wuhan but diagnosed in other provinces. Dates for this model were restricted to January 19-26, 2020. Both models calculated growth rate (r), and theoretical time (T0), using travel data, specifically the earliest times that an infect - ed person arrived in each of the 26 provinces. Findings The incubation period was estimated to be 4.2 days. The time from symptom onset to hospitalization decreased from 5.5 days before January 18 2020, to 1.5 days after January 18 2020. The change coincides with report of human to human transmission and upgrade of the emergency response to level 1 by the Chinese CDC. The time from initial hospital admittance to discharge was 11.5 days, initial hospital admittance to death was 11.2 days, and time from symptom onset to death was 16.1 days. The growth rate in the first arriv - al model was 0.29/day, corresponding to a doubling time of 2.4 days. This estimate was much higher than previous estimates of 0.10-0.14/day. The case count model and first arrival model both estimated consistent exponential growth rates and theoretical times: 0.29 vs 0.30/day, and December 20 vs December 16 2019. Clinical ImplicationsResults suggest that surveillance, quarantine, and strong social distancing efforts are essential for slowing down or stopping the spread of this virus. Limitations Because the reports collected were from the first few persons detected in each province, the estimations may be biased toward cases with more severe symptoms. In both models, researchers assumed perfect detection of infected cases outside of Hubei Province - how - ever in reality, this may not be the case due to changing surveillance intensity.

Study design Systematic Review Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods 21 reference articles were reviewed, including retrospective and in-vitro studies. The author used this data to categorize 3 major stages of disease based on the clinical course of the patients and the pathogenic mechanisms taking place at the cellular/molecular level. Findings Stage 1: Asymptomatic stage. Inhaled virus enters ciliated epithelial cells in the nasal cavity. There is local spread of the virus, and very limited response by the innate immune system. Stage 2: Upper airway response. Viral particles infect the conducting airways, triggering a robust innate immune system response. CXCL10 (interferon responsive gene) activity has been correlated with cell response to SARS-CoV and influenza, therefore CXCL10 levels may predict prognosis COVID-19 patients. Stage 3: Hypoxia and progression to ARDS. The virus infects gas exchanging regions of the lung, causing apoptosis and release of viral particles, with infection of other pneumocytes and diffuse alveolar damage. Clinical ImplicationsPatients are infectious but not symptomatic during Stage 1. RT-PCR could pre - dict viral load and infectivity. Approximately 80% of patients will have disease lim - ited to the upper airways - these Stage 2 patients can predominantly be treated symptomatically at home . Treating with epithelial growth factors such as KGF might increase ACE2 expressing cells, worsening the condition. The Elderly are at high risk for severe, Stage 3 disease due to decreased mucociliary clearance, diminished immune response, and limited regenerative capacity. Limitations The mechanisms of pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown. Due to limit - ed data, the author is assuming that viral entry for SARS-CoV-2 is the same as SARS- CoV. The conclusions drawn in this article are based on scientific studies but are ultimately opinions of the author. Further research is needed to prove these claims.PATHOGENESISReview by John Bretzman, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubMolecular immune pathogenesis and diagnosis of COVID-19 Xiaowei Li et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis March 5, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.001 Purpose To provide possible explanations for the immune pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 based on prior findings in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Study design Systematic Review Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods Review of 73 published references including animal models, comparative analysis, epidemiologic and longitudinal studies examining the SARS and MERS epidemics. Findings SARS-CoV-2 shows 88% identity to bat-derived coronaviruses and 50% similarity to sequences of MERS-CoV. Prior research during the SARS-CoV epidemic showed that antigen detection by means of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) presentation plays a role in pathogenesis. Various HLA polymorphisms correlated to susceptibility of SARS-CoV (e.g., HLA-B*4601, HLA-B*0703) infection while other genetic variances had a relatively protective effect (e.g., HLA-A*0201). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV demonstrated a critical proteolytic cleavage of its structural spike (S) protein to mediate membrane fusion and cell entry. In a longitudinal study, 14 of 23 SARS-CoV patients were found to have persistent specific T-cell memory responses to the S protein 6-years post-recovery. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have adapted strategies to evade immune detection, hiding pattern recognition receptors through specialized double-membrane vesicles. Clinical ImplicationsPolymorphisms in HLA molecules played a role in susceptibility to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; this genetic variation could possibly influence the diverse immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2. By studying SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV mechanism of entry, inhibiting S protein cleavage may serve as a possible target for therapy.

Ling Lin et al. Emerging Microbes and Infections March 20, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1746199 Purpose To review the immunological changes of coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and other viral pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV-2 and to infer potential pathogenesis. Study design Systematic review Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods A total of 43 published literature regarding the pathogenesis, immunological changes, and clinical observations seen in the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Influenza (H1N1), and COVID-19 viral infections were reviewed. Findings Review of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and H1N1 pathogenesis suggested several com - mon changes: increased factors (such as IL6, Histopathology shows diffuse - atous lung lesions and pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 virus passes through mucous membranes and enters the lungs through the respiratory tract, then the peripheral blood stream causing viremia. The virus targets organs that express angioten - sin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) such as the lungs, heart, kidney and gastrointes - tinal tract. The clinical phase of SARS-CoV-2 is divided into three phases based on symptoms: Viremia phase, acute phase (pneumonia phase), and recovery period. The following scenarios are described: If the immune function is effective in the acute phase, the virus can be suppressed and enter recovery phase. Risk factors for severe or critical disease include older age, immuno-incompetence, hypertension, and diabetes. Clinical ImplicationsUnderstanding the pathogenesis and immune related changes that take place during the COVID-19 infectious course can help build the treatment protocol for disease and improve prognosis. Clinical course can inform optimal treatment and potentially improve prognosis. Limitations The study was limited by the lack of immune-related research directed solely to - wards the immuno-pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Additionally, the clinical pathogenesis and host immunity patterns of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and H1N1 virus are incompletely characterized by the reviewed literature limiting the hypothesized pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.PATHOGENESISReview by Kaitlyn Wehrheim, MS2 ClubEvidence Gastrointestinal Infection of SARS-CoV-2. Fei Xiao et al. Gastroenterology March 3, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2020.02.055 Purpose To further investigate which cells SARS-CoV-2 infects by examining the level of RNA in feces, viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein in gastrointestinal tissue. Study design Case series (n = 73) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Clinical specimens including serum, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swabs, urine, stool from 73 hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were obtained and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the China Disease Control and Prevention's standardized qPCR. Esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and rectal tissues were obtained from one patient. Histologic staining as well as viral receptor angiotensin-convert - ing enzyme 2 (ACE2) and viral nucleocapsid staining were performed on the tissue. Findings In 20% of patients with SARS-CoV-2, fecal samples continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 despite negative respiratory samples. Additionally, immunofluores - cence showed that ACE2 protein, a cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia, which supports the existent hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2's entry into host cells. Clinical ImplicationsThis study recommends rRT-PCR testing of fecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 to deter - mine viral load and to ensure isolation precautions for hospitalized patients contin - ue if positive. Furthermore, the authors argue that t he low levels of SARS-CoV-2 nu - cleocapsid within the esophageal mucosa is due to their composition of squamous cells. The positive detection of viral RNA in feces implies that infectious virions are secreted from infected gastrointestinal cells. This supports the hypothesis of fe - cal-oral transmission as another route for viral spread and reiterates the importance of developing prevention practices addressing the fecal-oral transmission route. Limitations The sample size of this study was limited, particularly in regard to the tissue sam - ples retrieved. Future research is needed to deliberate the likelihood of fecal oral transmission after viral clearance in the respiratory tract. Additionally, further histo - logic evidence of viral nucleocapsid in the four kinds of mucosa examined (esoph - ageal, gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia) is necessary to build upon the afore - mentioned findings. Viral cultures were not performed on any of the specimens in this study. Some positive PCR results could represent non viable virus.PATHOGENESISReview by Alex Hornung, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubRates of co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens David Kim et al. JAMA April 15, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jama.2020.6266 Purpose To report co-infection rates between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens seen in Northern California. Study design Cross sectional study (n = 1217) Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs of 1217 specimens, from 1206 symptomatic patients, were collected and underwent reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, samples were tested for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Samples were then stratified on results for SARS-CoV-2 status and non-SARS- CoV-2 pathogen status. Findings A total of 116 (9.5%) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 318 (26.1%) tested positive for non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. Of the 116 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens, 24 (20.7%) were also positive for 1 or more additional non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. Of 1101 negative samples for SARS-CoV-2, 294 (26.7%) were positive for 1 or more additional non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. Co-in - fected patients did not differ significantly in age from only SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This study found higher rates of co-infection occurring than previously reported from China. Clinical ImplicationsDetecting the presence of a non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogen may not be sufficient to rule out that a patient does not also have SARS-CoV-2. In this study, co-infection with influenza, RSV, Parainfluenza, Metapneumovirus, Rhinovi - rus/enterovirus, and other corona viruses, albeit at low frequencies, occurred. Limitations This study includes samples from Northern California, which regionally limits the patient population as well as the viral epidemiology. Some viruses are seasonal or sporadic in occurrence and these variations could not assessed due to the short time period of the study.PATHOGENESISReview by Kevin Grudzinski, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubLiver injury in COVID-19: Management and challenges Chao Zhang et al. Lancet: Gastroenterology and Hepatology March 4, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(20)30057-1 Purpose To assess how the liver is affected by COVID-19 using the available case studies and data from The Fifth Medical Center of PLS General Hospital in Beijing, China. Study design Case series (n = 56) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Review of 7 case studies to date reporting the clinical features of patients with COVID-19. The authors report on laboratory studies of 56 cases of COVID-19 pa - tients who were hospitalized at their institution. Findings Seven large-scale case studies reported on clinical features of patients with COVID-19, indicating 2-11% of patients had liver comorbidities. During disease progression, 14-53% of patients had elevated alanine (ALT) and aspartate amino - transferase (AST). Those with severe disease, defined as necessitating care in the ICU, had higher rates of liver dysfunction. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in the sub - clinical phase (i.e., before symptom onset) had significantly lower AST abnormal - ity than did patients diagnosed after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool and blood samples, and 2-10% of patients present with diarrhea, implicating the possibility of viral exposure in the liver. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV both bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to gain cell en - try. A preliminary study has suggested that cholangiocytes are rich with the ACE2 receptor, providing a direct means of liver damage. Authors reported elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) in 30 (54%) of patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization. Additionally, they found elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in a single (1.8%) patient. Clinical ImplicationsCholangiocyte expression of ACE2 receptors may provide a means of virus inocu - lation. Patients with severe disease (exhibiting massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure) are more likely to have liver dysfunction. Limitations While likely due to the urgency surrounding the health crisis of this novel coronavi - rus, this study has analyzed a small number of patients with limited follow-up. They cite preliminary studies which have yet to undergo rigorous peer-review, again due to the urgency of the present situation.PATHOGENESISReview by Dallas Kramer, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubDescription and proposed management of the acute COVID-19 car - diovascular syndrome. Nicholas Hendren et al. Circulation April 16, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047349 Purpose To outline the available information about the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Acute COVID-19 Cardiovascular Syndrome (ACovCS). Study design Systematic review Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods The authors evaluated data from many sources, including clinical studies, previous MERS and SARS-CoV-1 cases, and case reports from COVID-19-positive patients. Findings In one analysis, 15 of 52 (28.8%) critically ill COVID-19 patients in China had associ - ated myocardial injury. Another retrospective study revealed that 32 of 54 (59.3%) COVID-19 patients who had died had myocardial injury. Only one of the 95 (1.05%) sur - viving patients had myocardial injury. In a small case series where three patients died from COVID-19, no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in cardiac tissue but the observed mor - phological changes suggested a secondary mechanism of injury, such as a cytokine storm. The contagious nature of COVID-19 is a barrier to endomyocardial biopsy . In lieu of biopsy, patients who have abnormal troponin and can be excluded from a myocar - dial infarction diagnosis on clinical grounds can be treated with classic management. The paper also states echocardiogram, angiography, or clinical imaging should not be done on COVID-19 patients, unless the patient is deteriorating. A cardiac ultrasound can be recommended if the physician can reduce exposure. ACE2 entry is a known mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, but its effect on cardiac cells specifically is theoretical as of now; SARS-CoV-1 was found to have affected cardiacmyocytes among other ACE-2 targets in patients who succumbed to that virus. Clinical ImplicationsTreatment of ACovCS is not well understood, and therapies such as hydroxychloro - quine and antivirals may increase risk for cardiac arrhythmia, further exacerbating ACovCS. IL-6 inhibitors are being studied to reduce the cytokine release thought to contribute to myocardial injury. In those with refractory shock or ventricular arrhyth - mias due to ACovCS, mechanical support can be used; case reports have shown rescue in these patients by using veno-arterial and veno-arterial-veno ECMO. Limitations Limited ability to conduct biopsies common in other cases may play a significant role in our ability to determine the effects of COVID-19 on the heart itself. Many compo - nents of this review use prior research done with SARS-CoV-1, which although in the same family, may present with a different set of symptoms and pathogenesis.PATHOGENESISReview by Adithya Sivakumar, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubPathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Lancet Respiratory Medicine February 18, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-X Purpose To investigate the clinical characteristics of a patient who died from severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) secondary to a severe coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infec - tion. Study design Case report Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods One participant positive with SARS-CoV-2, as confirmed by RT-PCR, was subjected to scrutiny of patient records, radiographs and histological analysis of post-mortem biopsy samples (lung, liver and heart). Findings Histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates. Both lungs showed evidence of hyaline membrane forma - tion, suggestive of ARDS. Additionally, CD8+ T cells within the samples displayed high concentrations of cytotoxic granules (31.6% cells were perforin positive, 64.2% cells were granulysin positive, and 30.5% cells were both granulysin and perforin double-positive). Of note, serial bilateral radiographs indicated rapid progression of pneumonia. Liver biopsy showed moderate, microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular activity, although there was no irrefutable evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 infection as the cause. Clinical ImplicationsThe study results suggest that an overactivation of T cells, increased Th17 and high - ly cytotoxic CD8 T cells may account for the severity of injury in this patient. Limitations As with many studies during this time frame, the sample size was limited (n=1). Ad - ditionally, the study design itself decreases the applicability of these results. None - theless, the authors findings do provide a scaffolding for future studies which could clarify the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia and also when thera - peutics should be administered to in similar severe patients to reduce mortality.PATHOGENESISReview by Alex Hornung, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal Club Comparative pathogenesis of COVID-19, MERS, and SARS in a non - human primate model. Barry Rockx et al. Science April 17, 2020 DOI: 10.1126/science.abb7314 Purpose To identify key pathways in the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by using cynomolgus macaques as a model system, which is critical in the evaluation of therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 infection for use in humans. Study design Animal model study Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods One group of four young macaques (4-5 years) and a group of four old macaques (15- 20 years) were inoculated with COVID-19. Nasal, throat, and rectal swabs were taken daily for up to 21 days and were tested for the virus by RT-qPCR and virus culture. Environmental sampling was done to determine if the surfaces where the macaques habituated were contaminated. On day 4, autopsies were completed on 4 macquaes with RT-qPCR was done on samples from their respiratory, digestive, urinary, and car - diovascular systems in addition to various lymphoid tissues. This process was repeated with 6 macaques who were inoculated with MERS-CoV. Histopathological findings of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were compared to previous studies of SARS-CoV. Findings Histopathologic examination of both young and old macaques inoculated with either SARS-CoV-2 or MERS showed evidence of diffuse alveolar damage. There was syncytia and hyaline membrane formation in SARS-CoV-2 macquaes, similar to previous studies on SARS-CoV. However, there were scant findings of syncytia formation and hyaline membranes in MERS-CoV macaques. SARS-CoV-2 antigens were found in type I and II pneumocytes, similar to SARS-CoV as reported in previous studies. No MERS-CoV an - tigens were found in type I pneumocytes, and were only occasionally found in type II pneumocytes. SARS-CoV-2 shedding peaked early in the course of infection, similar to observations in symptomatic patients. Increased age did not affect disease outcome, but there was prolonged viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of aged animals. Prolonged shedding was also reported in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 patients. Clinical ImplicationsSARS-CoV-2's ability to infect type II pneumocytes may contribute to respiratory dis - tress syndrome (ARDS). Authors sugest that the virus can spread early in the infection. Limitations The study was limited by its small sample size. Previous studies of SARS-CoV were used to compare histological findings to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. This study was done on macaques and findings may not be generalizable to humans.PATHOGENESISReview by John Levinson, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubCharacteristics and mechanism of liver injury in 2019 coronavirus disease. Jie Li & Jian-Gao Fan Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology March 28, 2020 DOI: 10.14218/JCTH.2020.00019 Purpose To highlight the clinical, pathological, and laboratory characteristics of liver injury in COVID-19. Study design Retrospective analysis Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Authors looked at studies originating from mainland China and in hospital settings, evaluating the clinical features and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2. They also evaluated prior studies of MERS and SARS-CoV to hypothesize possible pathophysiology and etiology of liver injury in COVID-19 and relied on prior understanding of secondary mechanisms of liver injury in patients suffering from infectious disease. Findings COVID-19-positive patients have had transient elevations in serum levels pathological changes, including microthrombi, in the liver have been observed in autopsies, but no specific features of liver failure nor bile duct inju - ries were noted. Prior research of SARS-CoV in mouse models has suggested upregula - tion of ACE2 in the liver is caused by compensatory proliferation of cholangiocyte-de - rived hepatocytes during acute liver injury during infection. Liver injury by SARS-CoV-2 may be through ACE-2-mediated damage to hepatocytes. Additionally, the use of ac - etaminophen and hepatoxic anti-viral drugs such as oseltamivir, abidol, and lopinavir/ ritonavir in COVID-19 patients could be contributing to elevated liver enzymes. SARS- CoV-2 infection and related immune changes might also be regarded as a \"second-hit\" to existing chronic liver diseases and needs to be further investigated. Clinical ImplicationsThere is insufficient evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infecting hepatocytes or causing direct liver injury. However, this review argues that the liver is the second most frequently af - fected organ outside of the lungs in COVID-19 patients, so more research on its effects on the liver is necessary. Limitations Many of the proposed etiologies of liver injury in COVID-19 in this study are specula - tive and based on prior studies conducted on SARS-CoV. Further follow up is needed on SARS-CoV-2-specific manifestation and pathogenesis of liver injury as research on this topic continues to evolve. Liver biopsies are rarely performed unless post mor - tem, so future histopathological studies may be limited. Additionally, this review only looked at Chinese studies.PATHOGENESISReview by Sameera Khan, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubSARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 in older adults: what we may expect re - garding pathogenesis, immune responses, and outcomes.

GeroScience April 10, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-020-00186-0 Purpose To compare the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 (cause of COVID-19 disease) in older adults to MERS and SARS-CoV. Study design Systematic Review Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Reviewed 67 publications on SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1. Findings SARS-CoV-2 infectivity peaks with high titers of viral load even before symptom - atic infection compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Progression to ARDS after COVID-19 infection has been marked by upregulation of plasma proinflammatory mediator. Typical clinical features of COVID-19, similar to SARS-CoV-1, include fever, cough, and myalgias. Unique to COVID-19, diarrhea and nausea may precede fever and respiratory symptoms. Coronaviruses are recognized by TLR7, RIG-I/ MDA, and cGAS/STING innate immune sensors; all result in early IFN-I responses necessary for control of infection. Neutralizing antibodies directed at the spike (S) protein binding site for the ACE2 receptor can possibly serve as protection but can be a challenge since SARS-2 S protein for ACE2 receptors have a higher affinity when compared to SARS-1. Clinical ImplicationsCOVID-19 patients show similar clinical symptoms to SARS-1 and although charac - terized as non-specific, the symptoms resemble influenza more than the common cold. Older adults are more susceptible to infections due to their immune respons - es being slower, less coordinated, and less efficient. Older men and men with co - morbidities are at highest risk for severe disease if infected with COVID-19. Limitations This study was limited in sample size and diversity of presentation and based on case studies. Further research is needed to know just how disproportionately older adults are affected by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.PATHOGENESISReview by Danesha Lewis, PhD student Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubComplement associated microvascular injury and thrombosis in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 infection: A report of five cases.

Two patients died and were autopsied. The remaining three individuals were examined for development of an extensive skin rash. Patient records as well as tissue samples were subjected to immunohistological assessments for a variety of complement proteins. Findings This study found patterns of damage in both the lungs and skin consistent with complement-mediated microvascular injury in all five cases of severe COVID-19. Of note, there were depositions of C5b-9, C4d, and MASP2, which provides evi - dence for the authors' hypothesis surrounding an overactivation of the alternative and lectin-based pathways. The authors speculated that saturation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which normally leads to the deactivation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), may lead to amplified complement activation thus increas - ing the likelihood of vascular injury. Some samples had pronounced C5b-9 deposi - tion, a key feature of many microthrombotic syndromes, indicating individuals with severe infection may benefit from the addition of anti-complement therapies. Clinical ImplicationsLabs that could indicate complement-mediated microvascular injury and thrombosis should be considered in patients , including: d-dimer, factor VIII, fibrinogen, antiphospholipid antibodies, and circulating com - plement proteins. Limitations Case series are subject to selection bias. Additionally, this case series had a small sample size, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Further examination of the proposed hypotheses, drug recommendations and pathways as well as confirma - tion of the pauci-inflammatory response exhibited in this cohort is necessary.PATHOGENESISReview by Alex Hornung, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubSARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor. Markus Hoffman et al. Cell April 16, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052 Purpose 1) To study the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through the binding viral spike (S) proteins to ACE2. 2) To evaluate whether S proteins undergo priming by the protease TMPRSS2, and if a protease inhibitor successfully blocks viral entry. 3) To evaluate whether neutralizing anti - bodies against SARS-CoV have cross reactivity with SARS-CoV-2. Study design In-vitro laboratory studies Level of evidenceNot applicable Methods Part 1 : Human cells (cell line 293T) were transfected to express SARS-2-S. A replication defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was used (one batch bearing SARS-2-S and one bearing SARS-S), in - fecting multiple human and animal cell lines, and genetic analysis was performed. Part 2 : Authors tested whether SARS-2-S is primed by cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) by using ammonium chloride CatB/L protease inhibitor camostat (active against TMPRSS2) was used to partially block SARS-2-S. Part 3 : Sera from 3 convalescent SARS patients was used to test efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Findings Part 1 : Western blot confirmed efficiency of human cells of this line in proteolytic processing of SARS-2-S. SARS-2-S and SARS-S-expressing viruses gained entry to an identical spectrum of cell lines, suggesting that they use similar receptors to gain entry. Genetic analysis showed similar amino acid residues between SARS-S and SARS-2-S in the receptor binding motif required for interaction with ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 infected the same cells lines as the SARS-CoV-related viruses that use ACE2 as their receptor. The amino acid sequence thought to be crucial for binding to ACE2 found in SARS-CoV-2 was not present in the SARS-CoV-related viruses that were unable to bind cells expressing ACE2. The SARS-2-S expressing virus was not able to enter cells when an antibody against ACE2 was present. Lastly, BHK-21 cells transfected to express ACE2 were easily infected, but parental cells with no ACE2 expression were not infected. Part 2 : Both SARS-2-S and SARS-S viruses were inhibited by ammonium chloride, suggesting CatB/L dependence. Full inhibition was at camostat mesylate and E-64d (a CatB/L inhibitor) were used together. When tested in human lung cells, this caused reduced viral entry. Part 3: SARS-S expressing viruses had a concen - tration dependent inhibition from SARS patient sera. SARS-2-S expressing virus was also inhibited, but with lower efficiency compared to SARS-S. Clinical ImplicationsSARS-CoV-2 enters cells via interaction between S protein and ACE2. Viral entry was dependent on proteolytic cleavage by TMPRSS2 as well as CatB/L. When a TMPRSS2 inhibitor was introduced, viral entry was inhibited. This may be a potential target for treatment. Antibodies against SARS-CoV from convalescent donors partially inhibited the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. This may be a viable option for treatment/prophylaxis against the virus. Limitations This in vitro work requires validation in humans especially as it relates to possible drug targets for viral entry including a TMPRSS2 inhibitor.

Journal of Virology April 17, 2020 DOI: 10.1128/JVI.00510-20 Purpose To explore the role of individual genetic variability in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Study design Observational analysis Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods Protein sequences of 34 representative alpha and betacoronaviruses, including all human coronaviruses were obtained. MHC class I-peptide binding affinity using 145 different HLA alleles was assessed against highly conserved sequences. These peptides were than cross-referenced with known SARS-CoV epitopes. Population allele and haplotype frequency data was aggregated by country, from which global haplotype frequency maps were generated. Findings This study identified HLA-B*46:01 as the HLA allele with the fewest predict - ed binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2. This was in keeping with previous clinical data associating this allele with severe disease in SARS-CoV. The top presenters of conserved peptides with high predicted binding affinities were identified as HLA-A*02:02, HLA-B*15:03, and HLA-C*12:03. 56 different HLA alleles did not demonstrate significant binding affinity suggesting lack of potential for cross-pro - tective immunity from other human coronaviruses. There was no global correlation between conservation of SARS-CoV-2 and its predicted MHC-binding affinity was observed, suggesting lack of selective pressure to present coronavirus epitopes. Peptide presentation appears to be independent of estimated time of peptide pro - duction during the viral life cycle, with no differences in presentation of early and late peptides. Clinical ImplicationsThis study has the potential to inform pairing HLA typing with COVID-19 testing to rapidly develop predictors of viral severity in the population and to tailor future vaccine strategies to genotypically at-risk populations Limitations This in silico study does not evaluate individual-level HLA typing and clinical out - comes data for any real-world COVID-19 populations. Relative risk of HLA type versus other disease modifying risk factors was not assessed. Peptide-MHC binding affinity is used as a predictor for T-cell responses.PATHOGENESISReview by Sameera Khan, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubVirology, Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, and Control of COVID-19 Yuefei Jin et al. Viruses March 27, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/v12040372 Purpose To provide a summary to public health authorities of COVID-19, the current state of treatment and vaccine development. Study design Systematic review Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods Review of 86 published studies on the virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, patho - genesis, potential therapeutics, and vaccine development of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Findings SARS-CoV-2 appears similar to previous SARS and MERS outbreaks with bats be - ing a likely important reservoir. Main mode of transmission is through inhalation of respiratory droplets, indirect or direct contact. COVID-19 and SARS have similar pathogenesis, with upper respiratory tract infection leading to lower respiratory tract infection, either resulting in mild viremia, viral replication in target organs, or over-activation of T cells leading to immune dysfunction, cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) can promote viral cellular uptake of infectious virus-antibody complexes resulting in enhanced invasion of target cells. The interaction of FcR with the virus-an - ti-S-protein neutralizing antibodies may facilitate both inflammatory responses and persistent viral replication in the lungs of patients. Clinical ImplicationsFinding consistency in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, which binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), may prove helpful for vaccination efforts. The most urgent task is to develop more intervention to allow for effective control of infection. Limitations This study offered no new clinical information and was simply a review of existing literature to guide public health officials in their response. The study focused main - ly on response and research performed in China and lacked global perspective.PATHOGENESISReview by Mira Marchioretto, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubSARS-CoV-2 Infection in Pregnancy - A Review of the Current Litera - ture and Possible Impact on Maternal and Neonatal Outcome Florian Stumpfe et al. Geburtshilfe und Frauenheilkunde March 10, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1134-5951 Purpose To provide an overview of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) and to outline the potential risks and complications for pregnant patients. Study design Systematic review Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Literature from cases on infection in pregnancy during the SARS and MERS epidem - ics as well as recent publications on cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy were reviewed. Findings Clinical symptoms of an infection of SARS-CoV-2 are identical to those cases in - volving non - pregnant female patients. Clinical course of COVID-19 in pregnancy can be associated with a higher mortality. Based on current literature published on SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, it does not appear that there is intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 onto the fetus. No pathogen has been isolated in maternal milk in the studies carried out to date, thus transmission via breastfeeding is currently regarded as improbable. Neonatal outcomes of patients born to SARS-CoV-2 infect - ed mothers had unremarkable outcomes as compared to their gestational age and weight-matched counterparts. Clinical ImplicationsNo treatment regarded as appropriate for non-pregnant women should be with - held in pregnant women unless contraindicated. Empiric antibiotic treatment for secondary bacterial infections is indicated. There is no recommendation for mode of delivery. It is assumed that transmission from mother to child in utero is un - likely and breastfeeding is possible once infection has been excluded. Limitations This study was limited by the number of studies available on disease course and outcome of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, methodol - ogy for testing vertical transmission from mother to fetus differed among studies, with several only testing throat swabs from neonates rather than including placen - ta, umbilical cord and amniotic fluid analysis.PATHOGENESISReview by Kaitlyn Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubClinical Course and Outcomes of Patients with Severe Acute Respira - tory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: a Preliminary Report of the First 28 Patients from the Korean Cohort Study on COVID-19 Eu Suk Kim et al. Journal of Korean Medical Science April 6, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e142 Purpose To investigate the clinical course and outcomes of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from early cases in Republic of Korea. Study design Cohort study (n = 28) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods The first 28 patients in the Republic of Korea were included. All cases were con - firmed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Clinical data were collected and analyzed for changes in clinical severity including laboratory, radiological, and virologic dynamics during the progression of illness. Findings Based off viral kinetics by serial RT-PCR of respiratory specimens from 9 patients from the early course of illness, viral shedding was high from the prodromal phase of the illness to the first 5 days of illness. Viral shedding decreased after day 7 of ill - ness. Viral shedding was higher in the upper respiratory tract (URT) than the lower respiratory tract (LRT). Clinical ImplicationsTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 may begin from the prodromal phase of illness, just like common cold or influenza viruses. The median time from symptom on - set to isolation of the patients was 3 days, and that high titers of virus shedding began from day 1 of illness with the peak around day 3-5 of illness , early de - tection and isolation strategy may be relatively less effective in containing the virus in COVID-19. Limitations Only 28 patients were included in this study and only 9 had viral kinetics by serial RT-PCR of respiratory specimens evaluated. The proportion of elderly patients and frequency of underlying conditions were small, and therefore the first 28 patients had relatively favorable outcomes. Evaluation for coinfection of other respiratory viruses such as influenza was not conducted.PATHOGENESISReview by Kelly Harmon, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubLiver injury during highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections Ling Xu et al. Liver International March 14, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/liv.14435 Purpose To summarize the characteristics and mechanism of liver injury caused by the highly pathogenic human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the new 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Study design Systematic review Level of evidenceLevel 1 Methods Systematic review of case series studies on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 cases in which liver injury was measured. The number of analyzed cases for each virus was 1907, 447, and 2264, respectively. Findings Recent studies on COVID-19 have shown that the incidence of liver injury ranged from 14.8% to 53.0%, mainly indicated by abnormal alanine transaminase/ aspartate levels with slight elevations in bilirubin . Albumin was decreased in severe cases, around 26.3-30.9 g/L. There was a larger proportion of those who developed liver injury in more severe COVID-19 cases compared to more mild cases. In those who died of COVID-19, the incidence of liver injury was between 58% and 78%. The mechanism of injury is still unclear, but since bile duct epithelial cells express angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE2) in much higher numbers than hepatocytes, this suggests that COVID-19 induced liver injury may be due to bile duct cell damage, rather than hepatocellular dam - age. However, drug-induced liver damage cannot be ruled out, given many of these patients are being treated with lopinavir/litonavir, which have hepato - toxicity as an adverse effect. Clinical ImplicationsWhile treating the primary disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians should also monitor for liver injury and be mindful when applying drugs that can induce liver damage . This paper recommends that patients with liver damage can be treated with drugs that both protect liver function and inhibit inflammatory re - sponse, such as ammonium glycyrrhizinate. Limitations Studies in this review were case series rather than controlled trials, so it is difficult to draw conclusions on whether the liver injury was due to COVID-19 itself or other variables such as medication adverse effects or medical comorbidities.PATHOGENESISReview by Bijan Zarrabi, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush with COVID-19: Conse - quences of Viral Toxicities and Host Immune Response Han Zhu et al. Current Cardiology Reports April 21, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-020-01292-3 Purpose To review current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mecha - nisms of myocardial injury. Study design Systematic review Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods 87 published studies regarding the biology, immunology, pathogenesis, and cardio - vascular complications seen in the SARS-CoV-2 infection were reviewed. Findings SARS-CoV-2 can present with severe cardiac injury manifesting with elevated troponin and heart failure. Cardiotoxicity, pre-exiting cardio-metabolic disease, and increased frequency of adverse cardiovascular events after disease resolution is associated with increased mortality. Increased incidences of cardiac injury among those with inflam - matory response syndromes and shock in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests an important relationship between the immune response and the cardiovascular sys - tem. The mechanism of cardiac injury is unclear but likely involves a combination of direct viral damage and immune mediated damage by inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and cytotoxic immune cell responses. Literature suggests that di - rect cell cytotoxicity through viral entry into vascular tissues via angiotensin convert - ing enzyme 2 (ACE2) may induce endothelial shedding and dysfunction that contrib - utes to vascular damage, local inflammation, and production of procoagulant factors predisposing to thrombosis, and myocardial infarction. Literature also suggests that there is no evidence of direct lymphocytic infiltration in the myocardium, but that the dysfunction of T cells can contribute to the cytokine storm and multiorgan dam - age seen in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical ImplicationsUnderstanding the pathogenesis of cardiotoxicity in the SARS-CoV-2 infection can aid in the use and development of treatments that can minimize the permanent damage to the cardiovascular system and decrease the cardiovascular - associated mortality of SARS-CoV-2. Limitations There are relatively few studies addressing the mechanism and pathogenesis of cardio - toxicity in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. More studies are needed on cardiovascular pro - tection during treatment for COVID-19.PATHOGENESISReview by Kaitlyn Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubReduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Bo Diao et al. medRxiv February 20, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364 Purpose To investigate the etiology of T-cell count reduction and activation status in COVID-19 patients. Study design Case control (n = 562) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Retrospective review of data from 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls who came to the hospitals for routine physical exam. Lab data included total T-cell count, CD4+, CD8+ T-cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration. expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases. Findings The number of total T cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients (60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay. Counts of total T cells, CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells lower than 800/L, 300/L, or 400/L, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentration, with patients in recovery showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to healthy controls. Clinical ImplicationsT cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the sur - viving T cells appear to be functionally exhausted. Cytokines such as IL-10, IL-6 and TNF- might directly mediate T cell reduction. Thus, new treatments fo - cused on mitigating these findings can be further investigated for use in ICU pa - tients. Additionally, the study suggests that treatment may even be necessary early on to preempt disease progression in higher-risk patients with low T cell counts. Limitations The study was limited by including only subjects admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan, China and by the limited number of healthy controls. Additionally, the co-morbidities and prior health status of the study participants were not included.

Study design Systematic review Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods Search performed using PubMed and Google Scholar for original and review articles. The data from these studies were analyzed separately. The authors drew conclusions fregard - ing incidence of cardiac manifestations in COVID-19 and their prognostic implications. Findings A history of cardiovascular (CV) disease confers worse prognosis in COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 are also more likely to have a cardiac complication regardless of car - diac history. A meta-analysis of 6 studies from China (n=1527) revealed the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 was the same as the general population, but was asso - ciated with a 3-fold greater risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that out of 44,672 cases, the case fatality rate was 2.3% overall, but 10.5% in those with CV disease. Troponin I elevation is the most common CV abnormality (8-12% of patients according to multiple studies). There are multiple mechanisms of cardiac involvement in COVID-19: 1) Direct Myocardial Injury: viral myocarditis (entry Systemic Inflamma - tion: and cytokine storm seen in some cases of COVID-19. 3) Supply/Demand mismatch: increased metabolic demand due to illness combined with decreased oxygen supply due to hypoxia injures myocardial tissue. 4) Plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis: systemic inflammation and increased stress can precipitate plaque rupture resulting in acute myo - cardial infarction (MI). 5) Iatrogenic: Medications used to treat COVID-19 (antivirals, chloro - quine) can cause direct injury to the heart and/or prolong the QT interval, predisposing to arrhythmia. 6) Electrolyte abnormality: can occur in any critically ill patient, but hypokale - mia is of particular concern in COVID-19 due to interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with renin-an - giotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Clinical ImplicationsPatients can be risk stratified based on a history of CV disease. The author suggests only performing CV testing in patients with high pre-test probability as to not overwhelm the system. The author suggests considering the use of fibrinolytics as opposed to percutane - ous intervention (PCI) in patients with COVID-19 due to the unique circumstances during the pandemic. Limitations This article reviews observational data. Some assumptions regarding the pathogenesis of CV disease in COVID-19 are made based on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.PATHOGENESISReview by John Bretzman, MD Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubDIAGNOSISTable of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubSAA is a biomarker to distinguish the severity and prognosis of Coro - navirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Huan Li et al. Journal of Infection March 22, 2020 DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jinf.2020.03.035 Purpose To determine if serum amyloid A (SAA) is a marker for prognosis and severity of COVID19. Study design Case series (n = 132 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods From January 18 - February 26 2020, 132 inpatients from Tianyou Hospital in Wu - han, China with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated for lab data and clini - cal assessment. Time points included admission, 2-5 days of hospitalization, and at the composite endpoint (Feb 26 2020). The data evaluated included blood SAA, C Reactive Protein (CRP) , procalcitonin (PCT), (L), platelet count (PLT), CT imaging, and disease progression. At the study endpoint, patients status was assessed as discharged, still inpatient, or expired. Findings Patients showed high levels of SAA and CRP . Out of 132 patients, 123 had SAA above 10mg/L (<10mg/L set as normal clinical reference). The L count decreased in these patients. As patients with COVID-19 became worse in clinical severity, the levels of SAA and CRP increased and the number of lymphocytes decreased. Using a ROC curve, the ratio of SAA/L was more sensitive in predicting the severity of COVID-19 clinical course than measuring SAA and L individually. When comparing the CT scans to the SAA level, patients with a higher SAA were more likely to have worse CT findings. Clinical ImplicationsLevels of SAA and CRP increase significantly in patients with COVID-19 infec - tions, and increased proportionally with respect to clinical severity. Lympho - cyte count (L) decreased in these patients as well. The ratio of SAA/L appears to be a more sensitive measure predicting severity of clinical manifestation as opposed to measuring SAA or L alone. Using both SAA and CT scans can aid clinicians in predicting patient severity. Limitations This study did not utilize a control group. Additionally, patients came from a single hospital, limiting generalizability of findings.DIAGNOSISReview by Kelsey Danley, MS4 (COVID-19): rRT-PCR or CT? Chunqin Long et al. European Journal of Radiology March 25, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108961 Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) and real-time re - verse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for COVID-19 pneumonia. Study design Retrospective chart review (n = 87 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Nasopharyngeal isolates and CT imaging were obtained on 87 patients among 204 patients suspected of having COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and sent for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and CT scans were examined retrospectively by two radiologists with 10 and 15 years of expe - rience in chest imaging, respectively. In cases of disagreement, a consensus was reached. CT evaluations included the lobar location and pattern of the lesion. Findings On CT imaging, peripheral distributions were observed more in the diseased group (72.2%) vs more focal consolidation (52.0%) in the control group (p<0.05). Moreover, ground-glass opacities were observed more frequently in the dis - ease group. Only one patient with COVID-19 had a normal chest CT. This yielded a sensitivity of 97.2% (35/36). In terms of the rRT-PCR testing, the test was initial - ly positive in 30 patients, for a sensitivity of 83.3% (30/36). However, of the six false-negative patients, three were positive with a second round of testing, and the final three were positive with a third round of testing. Clinical ImplicationsCT imaging proved to be more sensitive than rRT-PCR in the initial diagnosis of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in China. This study recommends that pa - tients with positive CT findings but negative rRT-PCR results still be placed in isolation and have rRT-PCR testing repeated in the subsequent days of admission. Limitations The study has a small sample size, likely because it was conducted during the height of the pandemic in China. The number of rRT-PCR tests conducted were limited by supply, and only those with fever and a positive CT test were tested with rRT-PCR.DIAGNOSISReview by Paul Parker, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubCOVID-19 infection among asymptomatic and symptomatic preg - nant women: Two weeks of confirmed presentations to an affiliated pair of New York City hospitals. Noelle Breslin et al. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology MFM April 9, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100118 Purpose To present the clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases presenting to an affiliated pair of NYC hospitals over 2 weeks between March 13 and March 27, 2020. Study design Case series (n = 43) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Retrospective review of medical records over a 15-day period beginning with the first PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection involving a pregnant patient on March 13, 2020. Clinical documentation for all pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 via PCR nasopharyngeal swab was reviewed. Records related to neonates born to COVID-19 positive women were also reviewed. Findings 43 pregnant women tested positive for COVID-19 infection during the study period. The mean maternal age was 26.9 \u00b15.9 years and median gestational age was 37 and 0/7 weeks. 86% of COVID-19 positive women showed mild disease, 9.3% exhib - ited severe disease and 2 developed critical disease presentations. 41.8% of women had an additional comorbid condition, with mild intermittent asthma as the most common. 14 (32.5%) of 43 patients initially presented without COVID-19 associated symptoms. No infants were found to be COVID-19 positive after birth. Clinical ImplicationsUniversal testing among pregnant women upon admission for delivery can help with infection control , and allows hospitals to preserve limited PPE supplies among women who are test-negative. There may also be implications in the man - agement of neonates delivered to COVID positive women and it supports more re - strictive visitor policies, strict hand and respiratory hygiene precautions, and mask - ing of all patients and birth partners, as well as staff on the labor unit. COVID-19 should also be considered on the differential diagnosis in women present with common perinatal and postoperative infectious or respiratory complications. Limitations This study was the largest case series to date of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, although the sample size still remains small. This cohort includes patients presenting for care at either a tertiary care center or a smaller community hospital in NYC, but these findings may be generalizable to other centers or regions with lower disease prevalence.DIAGNOSISReview by Wendy Tian, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubProfiling early humoral response to diagnose novel coronavirus dis - ease (COVID-19) Li Guo et al.

Study design Cross-sectional study Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Paired plasma samples and throat swabs were collected from 82 confirmed (via qPCR or deep sequencing) and 58 probable (qPCR and deep sequencing negative, but typi - cal symptoms) COVID-19 cases from Beijing and Wuhan hospitals. 135 plasma samples collected from adults in 2018 with acute lower respiratory tract infections and 150 plas - ma samples collected from healthy adults in 2018 and 2019 were used as controls. Host response against SARS-CoV-2 was examined using ELISA on recombinant viral nucleocap - sid protein. Cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV were tested by Western Blotting. CLustalW program was utilized to align nucleocapsid gene sequences. Findings IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were positively detected, respectively, in 90.4%, 93.3%, and 77.9% of the plasma samples collected from confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19. The median time to IgM and IgA detection was 5 days after symptom onset, peaking between 8-14 days. The median time to IgG detection was 14 days after symptom onset, peaking between 15-21 days. The detection rate for a single PCR test is 51.9% with >90% positive detection 1-3 days after symptom onset. By day 5, PCR detec - tion decreases to <80%, then <50% at 14 days. When comparing PCR to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody detection, the detection rate was higher by qPCR within the first 5.5 days after symptom onset, and higher by IgM ELISA after 5.5 days of symptom onset. Perform - ing IgM ELISA on qPCR negative samples, however, increased the detection rate to 98.6%. Clinical ImplicationsTesting for the presence of IgM on PCR negative samples in cases of suspected COVID-19 could improve sensitivity of testing and aid in early detection of subclini - cal patients , helping to prevent spread of the virus with early and accurate diagnosis. Limitations This study used a cross-sectional sample. Due to individual variation in production of antibody development, longitudinal studies likely would have yielded more reliable data. A strong cross reactivity was found between SARS-CoV-2 recombinant N proteins with human plasma positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-1, but not NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1. It is unlikely, however, that these patients were pre-infected with SARS-CoV-1 during the last epidemic in 2002.

Findings Most patients (43.9%) were Wuhan residents, and 72.3% of nonresidents reported contact with Wuhan residents. However, 25.9% of nonresidents denied recent travel or contact with Wuhan residents. Patient ages ranged from 0-14 (0.9%), 15-49 (55.1%), 50-64 (28.9%), and >65 (15.1%), with median age of 47 years. Most patients had nev - er smoked (85.4%), and 12.6% were current smokers. The most common presenting symptom was cough (67.8%), followed by fever (43.8%). Admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, or death occurred in 24.9% of patients with severe disease and 6.1% of all patients. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 91.1% of patients and acute respiratory dis - tress syndrome (ARDS) in 3.4%. Most common CT findings were opacity patchy shadowing No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 2.9% of severe patients. Notable laboratory findings of patients included lymphocytopenia (83.2%), thrombocytopenia (36.2%), and leukopenia (33.7%). Clinical ImplicationsThe clinical characteristics and conventional routes of transmission of COVID-19 mim - ic those of SARS-CoV. Absence of fever occurs more frequently in COVID-19 (56% on presentaton, 11% after hospitalization) than in SARS-CoV-1 (1%) and MERS-CoV (2%). Using fever as a symptom for detection may not be reliable. Limitations Some cases demonstrated incomplete documentation of exposure history and lab - oratory testing. The incubation period could only be estimated for 26.5% of patients, allowing recall bias to play a significant role. The studied population inevitably rep - resents a more severe presentation of COVID-19, as asymptomatic individuals or those with mild symptoms would likely remain home, not requiring additional medical care. DIAGNOSISReview by Andy Wu, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubRelation between chest CT findings and clinical conditions of coro - navirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia: A multicenter study. Wei Zhao et al. American Journal of Roentgenology date published DOI: 10.2214/AJR.20.22976 Purpose To explore the relationship between chest CT findings and COVID-19 pneumonia. Study design Retrospective study (n = 101) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Medical records were retrospectively collected for 101 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in four cities of Hunan province in China. Patients were divided in two groups: non-emergent vs emergent type infections. All patients underwent CT upon admission and the extent of respiratory involvement was evaluated using a CT scoring system. Chest CT scans were blindly and independently reviewed by two radiologists with 5 and 15 years of experience, respectively. Findings Out of 101 patients in the study, 87 (86.1%) were in the non-emergent group, 14 (13.9%) were in the emergency group. Eighty-seven patients had ground glass opacities (GGO) on CT, 65 had mixed GGO and consolidations, 72 had vascular enlargement in the lesion and 53 had traction bronchiectasis. Lesions on CT were more likely to have peripheral distribution (n=88), bilateral involvement (n=83), have lower lung predominance (n=55), and be multifocal (n=55). Patients in emer - gency group were older than those in non-emergent group but the difference in the rate of underlying disease was not significant. Clinical ImplicationsCT is considered routine imaging for care of COVID-19 patients. Combination of chest CT and PCR screening is necessary for early diagnosis. COVID-19 pres - ents with typical CT features can be helpful in screening suspected cases and evalu - ating extent of disease. Limitations The study was limited by the number of patients included (n=101). Other viral in - fections and negative results were not included in the analysis limiting comprehen - sive exploration compared to other lung infections. Follow up CT findings were not evaluated limiting insight on progression.DIAGNOSISReview by Ahmet Sakiri, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubComparison of throat swabs and sputum specimens for viral nucleic acid detection in 52 cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2)-infect - ed pneumonia (COVID-19). Chenyao Lin et al. Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine April 16, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0187 Purpose To compare the accuracy and efficiency of throat vs sputum samples in diagnosing COVID-19. Study design Case series (n = 54) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods This was a retrospective study on 52 patients at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China from February 7-16, 2020. Patients were diagnosed using WHO interim guidance. Simultaneously, both a throat swab and sputum specimen were taken and tested for COVID-19 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reactio (RT-PCR). Findings The majority of patients tested were middle aged and elderly males (average age 57.3 years and 27/52 were men). The percent of patients that tested positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR from a sputum sample was 76.9% (40 cases) vs. 44.2% (23 cas - es) from a throat swab. Authors reported that 51.9% of the patients had the same result on RT-PCR for throat and sputum samples, 40.4% showed positive sputum samples and negative throat swabs, and 7.7% showed negative sputum samples and positive throat swabs. Clinical ImplicationsProper collection of specimens is an important step in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. Screening patients via sputum culture compared to throat swab via RT-PCR may increase the accuracy of diagnosing of COVID-19. Considering that sputum is more sensitive than throat swabs for 2019-nCoV detection, patients should not be excluded from having COVID-19 if they have a negative RT-PCR result via throat swab. Limitations This study was a sample size of only 52 patients from a single hospital, thus evalu - ation of larger group of patients needed. Additionally, sputum has a high viscosity, which can make it difficult to test and there is no standardized pre-treatment pro - cedure in order to test serum. Pre-treatment of sputum in this study used acetylcys - teine, which can cause loss of some of the RNA. Also, the study did not include data on nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which would be a useful comparison for diagnostic methods. Lastly, not all patients produce sputum with COVID-19, thus this could limit sputum RT-PCR testing.DIAGNOSISReview by Kelsey Danley, - tecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Wanbing Liu et al. Journal of Clinical Microbiology March 30, 2020 DOI: 10.1128/JCM.00461-20 Purpose To look for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies on two immunogenic portions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients, the nucleocapsid protein (rN) and the spike protein (rS). Study design Observational laboratory analysis Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Blood samples of 214 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (and 100 healthy con - trol samples) were run using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect both IgM and IgG antibodies against the rN and rS proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 viral structure. Patients were 0-55 days post onset (DPO) of disease, with median DPO of 15 days. Findings Of the 214 patients samples tested for presence of anti-rN IgM and IgG antibodies, 68.2% and 70.1% of patients displayed positive IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. For anti-rS antibody presence, 77.1% and 74.3% of patients displayed positive IgM and IgG anti - bodies, respectively. The presence of IgM and/or IgG was looked at for both rN and rS, and patients displayed one or both of the antibodies in 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. Regarding time course of serologic response, positive rates of both IgM and IgG for rN and rS assays were low at <10 DPO, although IgM increased at 6-10 DPO. IgM and/or IgG for patients at 16 DPO was 88.9% and 90.7% for rN and rS, respectively. None of the 100 healthy controls displayed positive IgM or IgG to either rN or rS. The detection of IgM was significantly higher using both kits (81.3%) vs. the rN kit alone (68.2%), but not using the rS kit alone (77.1%). For IgG, 80.4% were positive using both kits, significantly higher than the rN kit alone (70.1%) but not so for the rS kit alone (74.3%). When testing for presence of IgM and/or IgG, no significant difference was seen between both kits (86.9%) and either rN (80.4%) or rS (82.2%). Clinical ImplicationsThe rS-based IgM antibody test is more sensitive for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 due to the earlier immune response against the S protein. Antibodies increased in a time-dependent manner, with IgM decreasing at >35 DPO. Antibody tests should be considered as adjuvant testing to nasopharyngeal PCR swabs, especially in patients who are >10 DPO. Limitations The study could not follow up with discharged patients to see the extent of the antibody decrease >35 DPO. Moreover, additional immunogenic proteins could have been tested using ELISA to observe antibody production to various parts of the protein. DIAGNOSISReview by Paul Parker, MD Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush ill with COVID-19 pneumonia: a prospective randomized controlled trial Cai-Neng Wu et al. British Journal of Anaesthesia March 19, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.02.020 Purpose Examine efficacy and safety of fiberoptic bronchoscopic intubation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Study design Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial (n= 60) Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods 60 patients participated the study and randomly split into HFNO and SMO groups, each including 30 patients. Two patients from the HFNO ultimately dropped out of the study. Six anesthesiologists performed 10 consecutive intu - bations, five from each group. Patients were positioned supine with their heads up and were pre-oxygenated for a total of four minutes via HFNO or SMO prior to rapid sequence fiberoptic intubation. During intubation attempts, HFNO was maintained whereas no oxygen was administered to the SMO group. Findings Intubation time was significantly shorter in the HFNO versus SMO group . HFNO group had both greater minimum SpO2% and lower occurrence of rescue face-mask ventilation during intubation as compared to the SMO group. There were no significant differences in 7-day mortality, incidence of SpO2<80%, or percentage of minimum SpO2 >95% during intubation . Clinical ImplicationsThere was shorter intubation time and lower incidence of desaturation during intubations leading to rescue face-mask ventilation in patients who received preoxygenation with HFNO. The results of this study suggest a possible avenue for anesthesiologists to consider during intubation of COVID-19 patients to limit potential exposure to the virus. Limitations Six anesthesiologists participated in the study; however, it was not reported in the manuscript whether outcomes were similar between the six anesthesiolo - gists or not. Smaller final sample size in HFNO vs SMO groups is also a concern. Authors did not mention breathing treatments or medications, such as steroids, prior to intubation, which could potentially impact ease of intubation and/or PaO2 percentage.CRITICAL CAREReview ClubCOVID-19 Infection: Implications for Perioperative and Critical Care Physicians John R. Greenland et al. Anesthesiology March 27, 2020 DOI: 10.1097/ALN.0000000000003303 Purpose To summarize the currently available evidence to guide management of critically ill pa - tients with COVID-19. Study design Systematic review Level of evidence4 Methods Literature review of 108 journals. Findings Critically ill patients tend to have high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, increasing transmission risk to healthcare providers. Studies conducted in Hubei Province, China showed 5-25% of COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the ICU, and of those in the ICU, 60- 70% progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although high-flow nasal cannula does not significantly decrease intubation rates, it has been shown to lower 90-day mortality in ARDS. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in H1N1 and MERS had failure rates 50-90%. After intubation, management of COVID-19 is similar to management of ARDS. Guidelines recommend low tidal volume ventilation (4-8 ml/ kg body weight) to maintain plateau pressures <30 cm H2O, with permissive hypercap - nia. Guidelines also recommend prone positioning >12 hr/day in severe ARDS if there are sufficient personnel to ensure lines and endotracheal tube are not displaced. High positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is cautiously recommended to increase lung recruitment, but some studies have shown increased mortality with high vs low PEEP . Clinical ImplicationsWhile use of angiotensin-converting of ACE-2 receptors, major cardiology societies do not currently recommend altering therapy for patients on these medications. Impaired secretion clearance is thought to predispose respiratory failure, highlighting the impor - tance of consistent bronchial hygiene in COVID-19 patients. Use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation with close monitoring should only be used as an initial management strategy for mild COVID-19-associated ARDS, or if chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation or heart failure is contributing to respiratory distress, as it had high failure rates in the prior H1N1 and MERS epidemics. Limitations The conclusions by the authors are drawn from review of clinical studies but need sub - stantiation from further research. Due to limited data, many of the management guide - lines illustrated in this paper are based off studies on MERS, SARS, and H1N1. Future research is also needed to address route of infection, and whether there are observed differences in clinical presentation based on transmission.CRITICAL CAREReview by Beth Hall, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubIntubation and Ventilation Amid the COVID-19 Outbreak: Wuhan's Experience Meng Lingzhong et al. Anesthesiology March 26, 2020 DOI: 10.1097/ALN.0000000000003296 Purpose To detail best practices regarding intubation and ventilation of critically ill COVID-19 pa - tients. Study design Review article Level of evidence4 Methods This is a summary of four webinars discussing preparedness, airway management, lung-pro - tective ventilation, goal of oxygenation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Information was based on firsthand experience from physicians treating critically ill patients in Wuhan. Findings This articles estimates percentage of patients requiring intubation at 3.2%. -Intubation Recs : Any patients with cardiopulmonary arrest or jeopardized airway should be intubated. Any patient in respiratory distress (respiratory rate (RR) >30/min) or with hy - poxemia (SpO2 < 93% on air (RA); PaO2:FiO2 < 300 mmHg) is only intubated IF 1) the condition has progressively gotten worse or is expected to get worse AND 2) 2hr high-flow oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation is not expected to be effective. -Intubation Procedure Recs : Infection Control: Two single-use filters placed in the inha - lation and exhalation breathing circuits. Preoxygenation: If patient on high-flow oxygen, consider bag valve mask or tightly fitting facemask. If patient on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), continue for preoxygenation. Modified Rapid Sequence Induction: Goal is intubation within 60 secs of muscle relaxants to shorten the period of potentially ineffective ventilation, from losing consciousness to endotracheal tube (ETT) placement. Muscle relax - ants are administered directly after loss of consciousness to facilitate speed. - Ventilation Recs : In the absence of formal vent settings recs, the authors recommend acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ventilation guidelines emphasizing 1) Tidal vol - ume (TV) less than 6 ml/kg predicted body weight; 2) RR less than 35 breaths/min; 3) pla - teau airway pressure less than 30 cm H2O; 4) positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) greater than 5 cm H2O. Clinical ImplicationsAnesthesia providers play a key role in the treatment of infected patients; critically ill pa - tients with COVID-19 should be intubated and ventilated per the above recommendations. Limitations The authors are simply reporting what has (and has not) worked during their clinical expe - rience treating COVID patients. There are no interventions, controls, or outcomes reported.

Study design Review article Level of evidence5 Methods Narrative discussion and expert opinion. Findings -Pre-operatively, fit the patient with a surgical face mask for transfer to oper - ating room (OR) with health care workers wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Transition from paper-based consent documentation to mo - bile electronic devices protected with single-use covers . In preparation of the OR, minimize personnel present, and utilize single-use materials when possible. Fit OR equipment with single-use plastic covers. Reduce drugs and materials kept in drug trolleys wherever possible. -Intra-operatively, sedation should be used with caution. Use nasal canula under the patient's surgical mask if needed . -In the presence of respiratory disease, use alternatives to brachial plexus block such as interscalene, suprascapular, or infraclavicular blocks to minimize the risk of diaphragmatic paralysis. -In the event of complications, anesthesiologists should be prepared to convert to GA or summon help for resuscitation. -Post-operatively, the patient should recover in the same OR to prevent con - tamination of other clinical areas . OR equipment should be left for decontamina - tion prior to use with another patient. Clinical ImplicationsHaving a well thought out plan for RA to manage infected patients may help to ensure the safety of both the patient and peri-operative team. Limitations This review lacks data to support its conclusions. Nuances of planning for surgeries using RA during infectious disease pandemics are largely left to individual institu - tion.CRITICAL CAREReview by John Sweeney, MS3 Table Journal ClubTREATMENTTable of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEfficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: results of a randomized clinical trial Zhaowei Chen et al. medRxiv April 10, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758 Purpose To investigate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in addition to standard treatment in patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 Study design Randomized double-blind study (n = 62 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods Patients were followed for 6 days. The treatment group received 400mg/day of oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) tablets on days 1-5 plus Standard Treatment (O2 therapy, antiviral agents, antibiotics, and immunoglobulin +/- corticosteroids). The control group was given Standard Treatment only. Findings Statistically significant differences were observed favoring the treatment group vs the control group for improvement in Chest CT findings (p=0476), days for reso - lution in fever (p=0.0008) and days for resolution of cough (p=0016). Only 2 of 31 patients in the treatment group developed side effects that were not \"severe\" . Clinical ImplicationsAlthough this study suggests that hyoxychloroquine treatment for patients with mild COVID-19 disease is beneficial, auxiliary treatment modalities are unspeci - fied and may have confounded the results, the patients enrolled were relative - ly young and the observation time was limited. Limitations The results may not be applicable to hospitalized patients in the US due to the ex - clusion criteria. Patients with cardiac conduction/arrhythmias were excluded which could limit the use of this medication in hospital patients who often are sicker at baseline and with significant cardiac comorbidities. Similarly, patients with renal and liver dysfunction at baseline were excluded, limiting application. Patients were of relatively young age (44.7 yrs), all patients had \"mild disease\" , the observation period was limited to 6 days and most significantly the standard therapy included confounding and unspecified treatments: antiviral agents, antibiotics and immu - noglobulin +/- corticosteroids. This standard care is worrisome as we do no know which patients received which antiviral agent or antibiotics and which patients received immuglobulin and in those who received immunoglobulin which also received corticosteroids.

Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease April 17, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101663. Purpose To determine if a hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination provides an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients and can decrease virus carriage. Study design Non-controlled, non-comparative observational study (n=80) Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods An 80-person inpatient cohort with mild COVID-19 infection were given hy - droxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of 3 or more days. Measure - ments included clinical outcome, contagiousness via PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). Findings All cases in this 80-patient cohort showed improvement in outcome mea - sures following administration of combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin except for two patients- one of which arrived to the hospital in an advanced form, and another patient who was still in intensive care at the time of writing. There was a drop in nasopharyngeal viral load with 83% testing negative on Day 7 and 93% on Day 8. Culture positivity began to decline on Day 2 with viral cultures being completely negative in 97.5% of patients on Day 5. Patients were discharged from the IDU with mean length of stay being 5 days. Clinical ImplicationsCombination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin shows promise in the treatment for SARS-CoV-2. It is important to intervene in the early stages of dis - ease with a treatment regimen to prevent progression to the irreversible severe respiratory complications. Limitations This was an uncontrolled study with a small sample size. The participants had a relatively mild clinical presentation, so the efficacy of this combination was not determined in more severe cases. There was also no analytic approach per - formed to look for potential confounding variables. Criteria for discharge was altered over the course of the study going from two successive negative naso - pharyngeal samples from PCR assay.

Study design Preliminary Uncontrolled Case Series (n= 5) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Five laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who also met the following criteria of severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; PAO2/FIO2 <300; and mechanical ventilation were given a transfusion with con - valescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody 10-22 days after admis - sion. Findings Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score de - creased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days. Viral loads decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2- specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased. ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechan - ical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. At the end of the study, 3 patients were discharged from the hospital and 2 were in stable condition. Clinical ImplicationsAdministration of convalescent plasma with neutralizing antibody lead to im - provement in the patients' clinical status. The limited sample size and study design do not allow for a conclusive statement about the potential effectiveness of plasma transfusion therapy. Limitations The study was limited by its small sample size and study design that included no controls. It is unclear if patients would have had the same outcome without transfusion of plasma especially since they previously were treated with other agents. The transfusions were also given 10-22 days after admission, so the tim - ing and association of outcomes is unknown.TREATMENTReview by Amanda Narkis, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubThe feasibility of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID- 19 patients: a pilot study Kai Duan et al. medRxiv March 23, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036145 Purpose To examine the feasibility of providing convalescent plasma (CP) as a poten - tial therapy for patients who have tested positive for COVID-19. Study design Safety trial (n=10) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Ten patients in three Chinese hospitals who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 (by rRT-PCT) and found to be in respiratory distress were identified. Convalescent plasma was donated by patients at the same three hospitals who met criteria for recovery from COVID-19. 200mL convalescent plasma was prepared and transfused according to WHO transfusion protocol. The first study endpoint was evaluating the safety of convalescent plasma trans - fusion. The second endpoint was improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within three days of transfusion. Findings There were no serious adverse events in all ten patients. All ten patients in the study experienced an improvement in clinical symptoms within one to three days of transfusion. Furthermore, all ten patients also demonstrated negative RT-PCR testing, increased oxygen saturation, and improved lympho - cyte counts, CRP and liver function. Neutralizing antibody levels, compared to those prior to transfusion, increased in five patients, remained the same in four patients and were not measured in one. All ten patients showed varia - tion in reduction of lesions on chest CT after transfusion. Clinical ImplicationsThese findings suggest that CP appears safe in a small number of patients. Additionally, CP may improve clinical outcomes. Limitations Prior to transfusion of CP , patients received varying therapeutic regimens. Some received antivirals, whereas others only supportive care. This lack of standardization of treatment protocol confounds the assessment of the po - tential benefits of CP alone. Furthermore, the small sample size and lack of a control group, limit the power and subsequent observations of this study.

European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases April 13, 2020 DOI: 10.1007/s10096-020-03883-y Purpose To summarize the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in multiple organ damage caused by COVID-19 and SARS-CoV, targeted blocking drugs against ACE2, and drugs that inhibit inflammation to provide a basis for further research, diagnosis and treatment, and drug development. Study design Review article Level of evidenceN/A Methods This article is a summary of pre-existing literature. Findings ACE2 is responsible for the degradation of angiotensin II (AngII) and it is down - regulated after viral infections. This is thought to contribute to the inflammatory response. An imbalance of the AngII signaling system is thought to play an important role in end organ damage. ACE2 is widely distributed and appears to be involved with the damage seen in various tissues (specifically cardiac, kidney, testicular, liver, and intestines). As such, cardiac damage is a concern in high-risk groups with COVID-19. Due to the potential pathophysiology in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, there is the possibility for fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. The use of ACE inhibitor in COVID-19 patients is still controversial and there are con - flicting theories surrounding whether ACEIs are beneficial or harmful in these patients . There are some small molecules on the market that target ACE2 and they have been shown to be effective at blocking SARS-CoV infection. However, the key amino acids in the SARS S protein that interact with ACE2 don't seem to be conserved in COVID-19 and there is no data to show whether these molecules are effective for COVID-19. In a study done in spontaneously hypertensive rats, a de - crease in thrombotic ACE2 activity was associated with an increase in thrombosis. Clinical ImplicationsBe aware of the potential for fecal-oral transmission, cardiac damage in high risk groups, testicular and renal involvement and abnormal coagulation in COVID-19 patients Limitations It is reasonable to believe that ACE2 plays a role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, but the clinical significance remains to be determined.TREATMENTReview by Caleb Bailie, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubTocilizumab treatment in COVID19: A single center experience.

Study design Retrospective Observational (n=15) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of Creactive protein (CRP) and IL6 before and after TCZ therapy and clinical outcomes within 1 week of treatment in 15 COVID19 patients were obtained from medical re - cords and analyzed. CRP was defined as elevated when higher than 5.0 mg/L and IL-6 was if higher than 7.0 pg/mL. Findings CRP levels were all far above normal before treatment and improved rapidly in all patients (126.9 to 11.2 mg/L; P<0.01 ). Although of the four critically ill patients who received a single dose of TCZ, three died and the other patient's CRP level failed to return to the normal range. Serum IL-6 lev - els initially spiked but decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients. There was a persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 in the four patients that failed treatment. One patient also had a clinical outcome of aggravation. Clinical ImplicationsOverall, TCZ appears to be a possible effective treatment option in relieving inflammatory activity in COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms. In most patients, acute phase reactant levels were decreased after TCZ adminis - tration. It is reacommended that critically ill patients with elevated IL-6 levels receive a repeated dose of TCZ since a single dose of TCZ failed to improve disease activity in critically ill patients although used in combination with glucocorticoid. Limitations The study was limited by its small sample size and not being compared to control subjects. It is also difficult to know which lab parameters are optimal in defining disease activity of COVID-19. It is unclear if outside factors such as comorbidities and age may have played a role in the study outcomes.TREATMENTReview by Amanda Narkis, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubHigh-Dose Intravenous Immunoglobulin as a Therapeutic Option for Deteriorating Paients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Wei Cao et al. Open Forum Infectious Disease March 21, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa102 Purpose Evaluate the value of administration of high-dose IVIG for rapidly deteriorating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Study design Case Observational Study (n= 3) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Three patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, severe type and administered high-dose IVIg (at 0.3-0.5 g/kg) for 5 days. Computed tomography (CT) scan was documented before and after treatment. All patients were treated at the early stage of clinical deterioration. Testing for COVID-19 was performed through PCR or oropharyngeal swab. Findings Of the 3 patients, all demonstrated clinical improvement shortly after administration of high dose IVIg . Variables measured include stabilizing tem - perature within 1-2 days and breathing difficulty alleviated in 3-5 days. CT scans compared before and after treatment demonstrated partial to complete resolu - tion of lesions. Between 5-6 days after the first dose of treatment, all 3 pa - tients tested negative for COVID-19. No adverse outcomes were reported in any of the 3 patients. Clinical ImplicationsIVIg used early in a patients course after diagnosis with the severe type of COVID-19 could provide clinical use in shortening the duration of symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the clinical results require confirmation from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The study describes 3 clinically rele - vant phases of COVID-19 including an initial phase, an accelerating phase with potential for an overall inflammatory storm (lab values indicating progressive lymphocytopenia and inflammatory markers) and a recovery phase. Limitations The study was limited by its small sample size (n=3) and lack of control cases. Additionally, confounding factors between patients include the use of lopinavir/ ritonavir in one patient and moxifloxacin in a one patient and a short course of steroids in the third patient.TREATMENTReview by Karina Oelerich, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubA Trial of Lopinavir-Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19 Bin Cao et al. New England Journal of Medicine March 18, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001282 Purpose Determine the efficacy of Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment in confirmed SARS-CoV2 infected patients in decreasing time to clinical improvement. Study design Open label, randomized control trial. (N=199) Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods 189 patients were randomly assigned to receive either Lopinavir-Ritonavir (400mg and 100mg) orally or via a nasogastric tube plus standard care; or standard care alone for 14 days. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement. Findings Patients assigned to receive Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment did not have a time to clinical improvement different from that of standard-care group. The 28-day mortality was numerically lower in the Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment group as compared to the standard-care group (19.2% vs 25% difference).The percentage of patients with clinical improvement on day 14 was higher in the Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment group (45.5% vs 30%). Secondary findings included the percentage of patients with clinical improvement on day 14 was higher in the Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment group (45.5% vs 30%) and detectable viral RNA at various time points was similar in both groups on subsequent sampling days. Clinical ImplicationsA 14-day Lopinavir-Ritonavir (400mg-100mg) therapy does not have a time to clinical improvement different from that of patients assigned to standard-of-care alone. Gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) were more common in the Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment group. The side effect profile ob - served in this study increases concern that a lengthened course of treatment or a higher dose regimen to improve outcomes might not be feasible. Limitations Based on the emergency nature of the trial, placebos were not prepared, thus limiting the ability to blind the participants and researchers. The characteristics of the patients were generally balanced but there was a slightly higher throat viral load in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, raising the possibility that this group has more viral replication, influencing clinical outcomes. Additionally, some patients received additional pharmacological interventions, such as glucocorticoid treat - ment, which might have acted as a cofounder.TREATMENTReview by Ashley Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEvaluation of Antiviral Therapies for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia in Shanghai, China Xiudong Shi et al. J Med Virol. April 16, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25893 Purpose Evaluate the therapeutic effect of antiviral drugs on COVID-19 pneumonia. Study design Single-center, retrospective review (n=184) Level of evidence4 Methods A total of 184 patients seen at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center that tested positive for COVID-19 were divided into 7 different groups according to their treatment, which was administered over a 5-day period. The groups were as follows: (1) symptomatic treatment only (2) Arbidol, (3) Lopinavir/Ritonavir, (4) Arbidol and Lopinavir/Ritonavir, (5) Interferon, (6) Interferon and Lopinavir/Ri - tonavir, and (7) Interferon and Darunavir. Chest CT scans at admission and at day 1 or 2 after treatment were reviewed and the Quantitative Evaluation System of CT for Pneumonia was utilized to calculate pulmonary inflammation volume (pneumonia volume). Findings The average pneumonia volume in all groups increased, except in the In - terferon and Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination group. However, differences between groups (i.e. Lopinavir/Ritonavir treatment alone or in combination with Interferon-2 or Arbidol) were not statistically significant . While there was also no significant difference in pneumonia resolution among the groups, the highest proportion of pneumonia resolution was in the Interferon and Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination group, followed by the Interferon and Daruna - vir combination group. Clinical ImplicationsThis study did not find that the addition of antiviral drugs in therapeutic regi - mens reduced the volume of lung affected by pneumonia in COVID-19 patients, nor did it significantly shorten their hospital stay compared to symptomatic treatment alone. The treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia remains challenging, as there are no specific and effective drugs available. Limitations This study set the treatment period of 5 days, which may not have been long enough to see results. Additionally, results of quantitative detection of viral load were not reported as part of this study and CT follow up findings were not in - cluded.TREATMENTReview by Athena Jane Manatis-Lornell, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubA pilot study of hydroxychloroquine in treatment of patients with common coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) J Chen et al. Journal of Zhejiang University (Medical Sciences) March 6, 2020 DOI: 10.3785/j.issn.1008-9292.2020.03.03 Purpose To study the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine sulfate treatment in COVID-19 Study design Single-center, randomized study (n = 30 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods The experimental group received hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400mg once a day for 5 days plus conventional treatment. The control received conventional treatment alone. Conventional treatment included bed rest, oxygen support, symptomatic care, antiviral medications (nebulized IFN-alpha, oral lopinavir/ritonavir), and antibi - otics. The primary endpoint of the study was negative conversion rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid in respiratory pharyngeal swab on day 7 after randomization or death within 2 weeks. Secondary endpoints were serious adverse effects or deterioration of patient's condition within 2 weeks. Findings By day seven, 86.7% (13/15) of the trial group and 93.3% (14/15) of the control group tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via pharyngeal swab. At two weeks all pa - tients tested negative, and were clinically improved. Clinical ImplicationsThis study showed no improvement in clearance or change in mortality with the addition of hydroxychloroquine to the conventional treatment. This study suggests that hydroxychloroquine is not effective as an adjuvant medication in addition to current standards of care. Limitations The study had a small sample size of only 30 patients. It excluded any patients with serious comorbidities. These exclusions make the results difficult to generalize to critically ill patients. The authors also noted that their study was underpowered to determine if HCQ was better or worse than standard care, by their estimates at least 784 subjects would be needed to appropriately power the study.TREATMENTReview by Joseph deBettencourt, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubCompassionate Use of Remdesivir for Patients with Severe COVID-19 Jonathan Grein et al. New England Journal of Medicine April 10, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2007016 Purpose To determine the clinical outcome of compassionate use Remdesivir (inhibits viral RNA polymerases) in the treatment of Covid-19 infection, caused by the SARS- CoV-2. Study design Open-label clinical trial (n = 53) Level of evidence3 Methods It is a multicenter study conducted at sites in United States, Japan, Italy, Austria, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and Canada. PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection defined as oxygen saturation of 94% or less while on ambient air or ox - ygen support. Participants needed a creatinine clearance greater than 30 ml/min and liver enzymes (alanine transaminase, ALT and aspartate transaminase, AST) 5 times below the upper limit of normal. The duration of Remdesivir therapy is 10 days, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. The main outcomes were discharge or death. Findings During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 (68%) of the patients improved clinically. Seven (13%) died after at the end of Remdesivir treatment. A total of 32 patients reported adverse events mostly elevated liver function tests (LFTs), rash, diarrhea, hypotension, and renal impairment, worse with those on invasive ventila - tion. Clinical Implications68% of patients diagnosed with severe Covid-19 improved with the use of Rem - desivir. Therefore, compassionate use of the medication is clinically valuable in the management of severe Covid-19 infection. Limitations Most of the study participants (75%) were men ranging between 23 to 82 years, which may introduce gender bias. The small sample size and non-randomization of participants, missing data were limitations in the data interpretation and results. There were no clearly stated inclusion and exclusion criteria. Even though compas - sionate use of the medication should be investigated for efficacy, it is difficult to draw useful conclusions from uncontrolled studies like this.TREATMENTReview by Ayesan Rewane, MSCR Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubAssociation of Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors with Severity or Risk of Death in Patients with Hypertension Hospitalized for Corona - virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection in Wuhan, China Juyi Li et al. JAMA Cardiology April 23, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1624 Purpose To determine whether patients with hypertension who are taking angiotensin-con - verting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have increased severity or risk of mortality during hospitalization for COVID-19. Study design Retrospective, single-center case series (n=1178; 362 with hypertension; 115 taking ACEI/ARBs) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Patients with COVID-19 (confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) admitted to Central Hospital of Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) from January 15, 2020 to March 15, 2020, were stratified based on the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia symptoms. Hypertension was defined as a history of blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or greater or a history of antihypertensive medica - tion use. Statistical analysis was preformed on all 1178 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in clinical severity or outcome for patients taking ACEIs/ARBs for their hypertension. Findings The frequency of severity of illness, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mor - tality did not differ with respect to ACEI/ARB therapy. Similarly, the percentage of patients with hypertension taking any drug or drug combination did not differ be - tween those with severe and nonsevere infections and nonsurvivors and survivors. The findings, however, confirm data that patients with hypertension have more severe illness and higher mortality rates than those without hypertension. Clinical ImplicationsThis study shows data to support the continuation of hypertensive medication during hospitalization for COVID-19. Limitations The study was limited by a small sample size of patients with hypertension on ACEI/ ARB therapy who were hospitalized with COVID-19. In addition, the current find - ings may not be generalizable to all patient with hypertension and it is still possible that ACEIs/ARBs could affect the chance of hospitalization. It was also not certain whether ACEI/ARB treatment at baseline was maintained throughout the hospital - ization for all patients.TREATMENTReview by Eric Moyer, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEffectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID-19 patients Kai Duan et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci March 18, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004168117 Purpose To determine the safety of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion in patients with COVID-19 and to observe the improvement of clinical symptoms, radiologic findings and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. Study design Prospective Cohort Study (n=10) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Ten COVID-19 patients (confirmed by real-time viral RNA test) in severe condition re - ceived one dose of 200 mL of CP derived from recently recovered donors (titers>1:640) transfused ~16.5 days after development of symptoms. CP was given in addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral treatments. Severe classification was defined as patients presenting with severe dyspnea, respiratory distress (tachypnea>30 breaths/ min), or hypoxia (SpO2<90%). A historic control group was formed by random se - lection of 10 patients treated in the same hospital and matched by age, gender, and severity of the diseases. Findings Chest CTs showed improvement in different degrees of absorption of pulmonary le - sions after CP transfusion in all patients. Lymphocytopenia and SaO2 increased where - as C-reactive aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotrans (ALT) decreased. An increase in neutralizing antibody titers was found in 5/10 patients, viral load was decreased to an undetectable level in 3/10 patients. Clinical outcome in the CP group improved as compared to the control group. In the CP group, three cases discharged, while the remaining seven cases were given a \"much improved status\" and were ready for discharge. In the control group, there were three deaths, six cases were classified as \"stabilized\" , and one case classified as \"much improved status\" . No serious adverse reactions or safety events were recorded after CP transfusion. Clinical ImplicationsOne dose of CP with high concentration of neutralizing antibodies can rapidly reduce the viral load and tends to improve clinical outcomes with minimal adverse reactions. Limitations First, patients received additional treatment beyond CP , which may have contributed to clinical outcomes. Additionally, this study had a small sample size and was unblind - ed, increasing risk of bias. Finally, some patients received glucocorticoid therapy, which could interfere with the immune response and delay virus clearance, altering study findings.TREATMENTReview by Ashley Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubTreatment With Convalescent Plasma for Critically Ill Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection Bin Zhang et al. Chest March 31, 2020 DOI: 10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.039 Purpose Document the clinical course in four critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma and supportive care. Study design Case series (n=4) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Four patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection with ages ranging from 31-73 years were given different combinations of arbidol, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon alpha-2b, oseltamivir, and ribavirin as initial treatment.. Their conditions progressed from moderate to severe. Transfusion convalescent plasma was given as a last re - sort and the course of disease was monitored. Findings - Case 1: The patient's viral loads significantly dropped. CT scans showed absorp - tion of consolidation and a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Patient was dis - charged. - Case 2: The patient's PO2/OI increased from 50/135mmHg to 97/198mmHg, one day following plasma transfusion. CT scans indicated absorption of pneumonia and RT-PCR test results were negative. Patient was discharged. - Case 3: The patient tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and had decreased serum IgM. CT scans showed absorbed infiltrative lesions and RT-PCR tests of spu - tum in deep lungs were negative. Patient was transferred to the unfenced ICU for further treatment of underlying diseases and multiple organ failure. - Case 4: The patient's anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM tested negative while IgG levels were positive. CT scan showed absorption of opacities and RT-PCR tests were negative. Patient was discharged. Clinical ImplicationsConvalescent plasma therapy may prove to be beneficial as a last resort treatment for severely ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. No serious adverse reactions were observed in these 4 patients associated with the transfusion of convalescent plasma. Limitations The relative benefits of supportive care, medications, and the patient's immune response could not be determined. Whether convalescent plasma can provide any clinical benefit must still be tested by randomized control trial.TREATMENTReview by Sarah Sun, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEffect of High vs Low Doses of Chloroquine Diphosphate as Adjunc - tive Therapy for Patients Hospitalized With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection Mayla Gabriela Silva Borba et al. JAMA Network April 22, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.8857 Purpose To assess the safety and efficacy of high and low-dose chloroquine (CQ) for patients with severe COVID-19 Study design Parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial (n= 81) Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods Primary outcome was lethality by day 28, secondary outcomes were lethality on day 13, patient clinical status, lab examinations, electrocardiogram (ECG) on days 13 and 28, daily clinical status, duration of mechanical ventilation, supplemental O2 use, and time from treatment to death. Of 131 patients admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory dis - tress syndrome (ARDS) older than 18 years of age, 81 were determined to be positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR or have a high likelihood of having COVID-19 by epidemiologic data. 41 patients were placed on high dose CQ (600mg BID for 10 days) and 40 were placed on low dose CQ (450mg BID for one day then 450mg daily for 4 days; placebo tablets were used such that low dose patients took equal number of total tablets as high dose pa - tients). The study hypothesized that lethality would be decreased by 50% in the high-dos - age versus the low-dosage group. Findings At day 13, lethality was 39.0% (16/41) in the high-dose group in the low-dosage group, additionally 86.4% (19/22) of the deceased still had virologic con - firmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection antemortem . These findings showed the opposite of the study's hypothesis and the safety review board recommended the immediate inter - ruption of the study. This study shows no evidence of benefit or increased viral clear - ance with use of chloroquine in patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2. High-dose chloroquine was associated with increased mortality over low-dose chloroquine dosing and over historical mortality data of similar patients with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical ImplicationsThis trial suggests use of high-dose CQ (12g) given concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir is not safe, showed no evidence of benefit, and should not be used to treat patients with severe COVID-19. Limitations The study was ended early due to concerns for increased lethality with high-dose regimen, leaving the study underpowered to detect efficacy of either dosages. It also only focuses on critically ill patients and results may not be generalizable to less severe disease. All patients received oseltamivir (for influenza) which is also known to increase the QTc inter - val. It is possible increased lethality of CQ may have resulted from synergistic cardiotoxic effects. No placebo group was used.

Study design Opinion paper Level of evidenceN/A Methods Authors review the epidemiology of COVID-19 disease (caused by SARS- CoV-2) in humans and animal models of SARS-CoV that studied the effects of estrogen on pathogenesis and outcome of SARS-CoV disease. Findings Patient demographics for COVID-19 disease (caused by SARS-Cov-2) at the time of this publication show that males more often experience disease and have higher mortality than women. Literature exists for SARS-CoV murine experiments that demonstrate an estrogen protective effect. Clinical ImplicationsThe authors speculate that exogenous estrogen treatment may be beneficial for men experiencing COVID-19 disease. Limitations The authors provide a somewhat unorthodox approach for treatment for COVID-19 disease in males. Nevertheless, prospective clinical studies might be warranted, i.e., determine the efficacy of exogenous estrogen treatment for COVID-19 disease in men.TREATMENTReview by Ashley Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubManagement of COVID-19 Respiratory Distress John J. Marini et al. JAMA April 24, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jama.2020.6825 Purpose The purpose of this article is to summarize the current recommendations for ventilation support in COVID-19 patients with ARDS Study design Literature Review Level of evidence5 Methods This paper reviewed current literature on the management of COVID-19 ventilation sup - port. The authors describe two patient phenotypes: Type L and Type H . infiltrates, infiltrates of atelectasis and edema, lower compliance, PEEP responsive, overtly dyspneic Findings -In the early stages of CARDS (COVID-19 with ARDS), the objective should be ade - quate gas exchange and avoidance of patient self-induced lung injury (P-SILI) from powerful respiratory effort causing lung and vascular stress. Options include sup - plemental O2, ventilation (NIV), and target nonvigorous breathing. Early intubation, effective sedation, and/ or paralysis may interrupt this cycle. For Type L patients after intubation, the goal is to minimize pulmonary stress, optimize O2, and avoid VILI (ventilator-induced lung injury) vortex. Use lower PEEP (<10 cm H2O), use more liberal tidal volume (7-9 mL/ kg) as needed, and consider prone positioning. If lung edema increases in the Type L patient (either because of the disease itself and/or P-SILI), Type H phenotype progressively develops. The goal in Type H patients after intubation is to reduce and evenly distrib - ute lung and vascular stresses, optimize O2, and avoid VILI. Use higher PEEP (<15 cm H2O), lower tidal volume (5-7 mL/kg), reduce O2 demand and implement prone position - ing. Despite the disease type, weaning should be undertaken cautiously. The goal for the weaning phase is to avoid reversion to previously worsened pulmonary state by causing VILI and worsening edema. Clinical ImplicationsThe recommendations described above represent the most current ventilation recom - mendations in COVID-19 patients with ARDS and could improve outcomes. Limitations This paper attempts to categorize COVID patients with respiratory distress into two groups; however, not all patients may conveniently fall into each of these two groups but rather fall along a spectrum of respiratory compromise.TREATMENTReview by Eric Moyer, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubHydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial Philippe Gautret et al. Int J Antimicrob Agents March 20, 2020 DOI: 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949 Purpose This clinical trial aims to assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine +/- azithromycin on respi - ratory viral loads in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients compared to a control group. Study design Open label, non-randomized clinical trial (n=36) Level of evidence3 Methods 36 of 42 patients who met inclusion criteria (age >12 and PCR documented SARS-CoV-2 carriage in nasopharyngeal sample at admission regardless of clinical status) were seen at baseline for enrollment, initial data collection and treatment at day 0, and again for daily follow-up for 14 days. Patients in the study group received oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg TID for 10 days. Among hydroxychloroquine- treated patients (n=20), six received azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg per day for the next 4 days) to prevent bacterial super-infection. The primary endpoint was virological clearance at day-6 post-inclusion. Findings The proportion of patients that had negative PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples was significantly different between treated patients and controls at days 3-4-5 and 6 post-in - clusion. At day 6, 70% of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were virologicaly cured comparing with 12.5% in the control group (P=0.001). Similarly, the addi - tion of azithromycin led to a statistically significant benefit (100% patients were virologically cured) when compared to the hydroxychloroquine-only treatment group (57.1%, P<0.001) at days 3-4-5 and 6 post-inclusion. Overall, it is shown that hydroxychloroquine is efficient in clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriage of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients in only three to six days. These preliminary results also suggest a synergistic effect of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; however, it is important to note that only six patients were given azithromycin in addition to hydroxychloroquine. Clinical Implications-Hydroxychloroquine alone for the treatment of COVID-19 may be useful in reducing viral loads, but larger randomized trials should be performed -The addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients may pro - vide an additional benefit in reducing viral loads but larger randomized trials are required. Limitations There were limitations of this study including a small sample size, limited long-term out - come follow-up, and a dropout of six patients from the study. This clinical trial was also not randomized, which could introduce bias into the study.TREATMENTReview by Eric Moyer, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEffective Treatment of Severe COVID-19 Patients with Tocilizumab Xiaoling Xu et al.

Study design Case Series (n=21) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 were given tocilizumab (400 mg once through IV Drip) in addition to routine therapy between February 5, 2020 -February 14, 2020. Changes in clinical manifestations (Body temp., Oxygen saturations etc), CT scan images (performed on admission and 1 week after receiving therapy), and laboratory examinations were retrospectively analyzed. Findings Within a few days, the fever returned to normal and all other symptoms im - proved remarkably . 75% of patients had lowered their oxygen intake and one patient no longer needed Oxygen therapy. CT scan manifested that the lung lesion opacity absorbed in 90.5% of patients. The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood decreased in 85% of patients before treatment, returned to normal in 52.5% of pa - tients on Day 5 of treatment. Abnormally elevated C-reactive protein decreased sig - nificantly in 84.2% of patients. No obvious adverse reactions were observed during the duration of treatment. 90.5% of patients were discharged an average of 13.5 days after treatment with tocilizumab and the rest were recovering well at the end of the trial period. Clinical ImplicationsClinical data showed that symptoms, hypoxemia and CT opacity changes were im - proved immediately after treatment with tocilizumab in most patients. - Tocilizumab is hypothesized to be an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy for severe patients, but larg - er randomized trials must be performed. Limitations The number of patients were rather limited and no control group was included. This was a single observation study and significant bias could possibly exist. The patients received standard of care treatment (lopinavir, methylprednisolone, other symptom relivers and oxygen therapy) in addition to Tocilizumab. As a result, the possibility that these agents could have contributed to positive clinical outcomes cannot be ruled out.TREATMENTReview by Ashley Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubUse of convalescent plasma therapy in two COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome in Korea Jin Y oung Ahn et al. J Korean Med Sci April 13, 2020 DOI: 10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e149 Purpose To describe outcomes of convalescent plasma therapy in acute respiratory distress (ARDS) in two patients. Study design Uncontrolled Case Series (n=2) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Both patients received hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir after initial diagnosis of COVID-19, both progressed to ARDS, and required mechanical ventilation. The patients then received convalescent plasma from donors in their 20s, positive for ELISA IgG test for SARS- CoV-2, with previous presentation of bilateral pneumonia. The donors were determined to have completely recovered. Plasma was divided into two doses and administered at 12-hour intervals with each dose given over course of 1 hour. Both cases involved simultaneous infu - sion of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids were not given initially (due to the lack of evidence of its clinical efficacy on mortality reduction) but applied when the patients' condition dete - riorated to ARDS (methylprednisolone was administered one day and two days before the plasma infusion to patient 1 and 2, respectively). Findings Patient 1 : Previously healthy 71-year-old male -Day 9 of hospitalization (Day 22 of symptom onset), received convalescent plasma. -Day 11, patient's condition improved with fever subsiding, decreased oxygen demand and CRP . Radiograph showed resolution of lung infiltrate. Patient was weaned from ventilator. Patient 2 : 67-year-old woman with history of hypertension -Day 4, patient was intubated due to increased oxygen demand with intravenous methyl - prednisolone added and was put into prone position to improve oxygen demand. -Day 6, convalescent plasma was provided. -Day 9, density of bilateral infiltration improved along with decreased CRP and IL-6 levels. -Day 20, negative rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. -Day 24, patient was extubated and discharged. Clinical ImplicationsTransfusion of convalescent plasma shows promise for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Following the infusion of convalescent plasma, viral loads rapidly decrease, inflam - matory makers decrease, and oxygenation improves. Limitations This describes only two patients with similar clinical presentations of ARDS and similar treat - ment regimens, preventing generalizability to a diverse patient population. Additionally, the timing of administration of plasma varied greatly, and the antibodies provided in the plasma could not be determined if they had high neutralizing titers.TREATMENTReview by Christina Brown, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubSome Drugs for COVID-19 The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics April 6, 2020 Retrieved from: secure.medicalletter.org/w1595a Purpose To review current data regarding the efficacy or lack thereof for the use of repurposed drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 in addition to the impact of commonly used daily medications on COVID-19 disease progression. Study design Review Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods The researchers summarized the clinical evidence related to repurposing of drugs for the treat - ment of COVID-19. They chose agents that have been widely reported on as potential treatments. Findings -ACE inhibitors and ARBS : There is no clinical evidence to suggest these agents increase or decrease the severity of COVID-19. Patients who take these drugs and contract COVID-19 should continue their medications as prescribed. -NSAIDS : There is no clinical evidence that NSAIDs increase or decrease the severity of COVID-19, however continued fever suppression with NSAIDs can possibly decrease the immune system and increase the duration of viral shedding. Patients who are taking NSAIDs for other indications should not stop taking them. -Lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) : When compared to standard care in clinical trial of severely dis - eased COVID-19 patients, Kaletra was no more effective than the standard of care alone and Soci - ety of Critical Care Medicine does not recommend its use in critically ill patients. -Hydroxychloroquine with Azithromycin : Open label study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in France suggests enhanced viral load reduction compared to treatment of hydroxychloroquine alone. These drugs can prolong the QT interval - clinical trials evaluating safety and efficacy are in progress. -IL-6 inhibitors (ie: tocilizumab, sarilumab) : Insufficient data, clinical trials are in progress to see if these agents and reduce cytokine induced lung damage in patients with severe disease. -Convalescent sera : Passive antibody therapy using serum of recovered patients was both safe and reduced viral load in Chinese patients who were treated early in the course of their infection with COVID-19. There are ongoing studies to examine this effect in critically ill patients. Clinical ImplicationsThe data summarized in this review helps guide clinicians in the treatment of COVID-19 and helps delineate between evidence-based practice and media publicization of available agents. The authors also advise that until clinical trials clearly establish the safety and efficacy of any drug used for COVID-19 treatment, current standard of practice is supportive treatment and management of COVID-19 complications. Limitations This review was unable to adequately synthesize efficacy of the drugs highlighted in this review due to lack of high quality RCTs. Also, little data describing the effect of the drugs in patients with different disease severity; the review findings only commented on limited ranges of disease sever - ity.TREATMENTReview by Demetrios Geanon, MS3 Table of with for COVID-19: An Open-La - bel Control Study Qingxian Cai et al.

In the control group, 45 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1-14: 400 mg/100mg 2x/day). Both groups were also treated with IFN-alpha by aerosol inhala - tion. Patients with severe clinical condition were excluded from the study. Treatment was continued with anti-viral therapy until viral clearance was attained or until 14 days had passed. The primary endpoints were time to viral clearance and the improvement rate of chest computed tomography (CT) scans on Day 14 after treatment. Findings The median time of viral clearance (Kaplan-Meier survival curves) for patients treated with FPV was 4 days compared to patients treated with LPV/RTV, which was 11 days. After con - trolling for confounding factors, antiviral therapy when comparing FPV to LPV/RTV had a Hazard Ratio = 3.434 and 95% Confidence Interval = 1.162-10.148 demonstrating that FPV had a greater effect on viral clearance. Patients treated with FPV had a greater im - provement rate in CT on day 14 after treatment compared to the control arm of the study (91.4% compared to 62.2%, P=.004) In the FPV treated group, 4 patients (11.43%) expe - rienced adverse reactions (diarrhea, liver injury and poor diet). In the group treated with LPV/RTV, 25 patients (55.56%) experienced adverse reactions (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, rash, liver injury, chest tightness and palpitations). Clinical Implications-Both CT imaging and time to viral clearance showed greater improvement in pa - tients treated with RPV compared to LPV/RTV, demonstrating better treatment outcomes in the FPV group. -These clinical results should be confirmed with a Randomized Control Trial (RCT), to bet - ter understand both the adverse effects of each medication as well as their clinical efficacy. Limitations The study was limited by a small sample size, inherent selection bias in patient recruitment and a lack of randomization. Because patients with severe clinical condition were exclud - ed from the study, the results may be less applicable to any patients with a more severe clinical course.TREATMENTReview by Karina Oelerich, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubArbidol monotherapy is superior to lopinavir/ritonavir in treating COVID-19 Zhen Zhu et al. Journal of Infection March 30, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.060 Purpose To evaluate the antiviral efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir versus arbidol in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Study design Retrospective cohort review (n=50 patients) Level of evidence4 Methods Fifty patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were divided into two groups: lopinavir/ritona - vir group (n=34) and arbidol group (n=16). All patients received standard treatments of oxygen supplementation and inhalation of recombinant human interferon-alpha2b. Patients who were in the lopinavir/ritonavir group (n=34) received a 400 mg/100 mg regimen twice daily for 1 week. Pa - tients who were in the arbidol group (n=16) received 0.2 g three times daily for 1 week. Outcomes measured included duration of fever in days, various laboratory markers including LFTs, CRP , WBCs, D-dimer, CT findings of pneumonia and days testing positive for COVID-19 RNA were recorded and analyzed. Findings There was no statistically significant difference in duration of fever, which lasted < 7 days in both groups, ALT, WBC count, and D-dimer. The lopinavir/ritonavir group had statistically significant higher CRP values and neutrophils than the arbidol group in addition to statistically significant lower lymphocyte counts. No patients across either group developed severe pneumonia or ARDS. On day 7 of admission, 50% of patients in the arbidol group had undetectable COVID-19 viral loads compared to 23.5% of patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir group. On day 14, viral load was unde - tectable in all patients in the arbidol group whereas viral RNA was detected in 44.1% of patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Furthermore, total duration of positive COVID-19 RNA testing in days was shorter to a statistically significant degree in the arbidol group compared to the lopina - vir/ritonavir group. No apparent side effects were found in both groups. Clinical ImplicationsThe arbidol monotherapy regimen was superior to the lopinavir/ritonavir regimen in the treatment of COVID-19. A previous study from China suggested that arbidol combined lopina - vir/ritonavir was superior to the lopinavir/ritonavir alone, and so this study suggests that arbidol monotherapy may be sufficient for the treatment of COVID-19. Limitations This study was a retrospective cohort review without randomization. Furthermore, there was a size discrepancy between the two groups such that there was more than double the number of patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir group compared to the arbidol monotherapy group. This limits the power of the findings associated with the arbidol monotherapy group. Additionally, there was no mention of specific inclusion or exclusion criteria for patients in this study, such as comorbid - ities or other medications the patients take on a regular basis. Lastly, all patients seemed to have mild disease, as none of the 50 patients in the study had severe pneumonia or ARDS. This limits the generalizability of these findings to other populations of COVID-19 patients with more severe disease.TREATMENTReview by Demetrios Geanon, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubCreating a framework for conducting randomized clinical trials during disease outbreaks Natalie E. Dean et al. New England Journal of Medicine April 2, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMsb1905390 Purpose To address some of the challenges faced when conducting clinical trials during pandemics and proffer important recommendations. Study design Review Level of evidenceN/A Methods This article closely observed the trends of two major randomized trials during the Ebola epidemic: The Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia (PREVAIL) and Investigational Therapeutics for the Treatment of People with Ebola Virus Dis - ease (PALM) conducted in Liberia and Congo (DRC). Findings Authors call for the implementation of a generalized protocol, which would serve as a reliable model across multiple infectious disease outbreaks. The details are as below: All clinical trials should be published regardless of the results or clinical out - comes as clearly stated in the Declaration of Helsinki. This serves to eliminate publi - cation bias. Inconclusive results are useful to support the evidence of the safety and efficacy of the agent under investigation. The PREVAIL study using ZMapp did not show a clear efficacy, but ZMapp was the control used in the PALM trials. A Core or Master Protocol is being proposed to regulate the conduct of clinical trials during pandemics. Specifically, this proposal focuses on diseases that occur irregularly, yet still relatively frequently, like Ebola. Efficacy data should not be released from trials that have not been completed due to insufficient enrollment. In these cases, an in - dependent monitoring team can use interim results to make recommendations on whether or not the trial should continue, but the investigators would not be made aware of the results of these analyses. Clinical ImplicationsCommon challenges of conducting clinical trials during an outbreak include unpre - dictable sample size, duration of outbreaks and geographic location. Regardless of the outcome of these clinical trials, they all provide important information to deter - mine treatment and evaluate potential vaccines for emerging diseases only if they are designed under a \"core protocol\" , which meets the conventional standards for licensure and is applicable to various infectious disease outbreaks. Limitations The conclusions of this review were drawn mostly from smaller scale disease out - breaks and failed to compare the conduction of clinical trials during pandemics.TREATMENTReview by Ayesan Rewane, MSCR Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubPharmacologic treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) James M. Sanders JAMA Network April 13, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jama.2020.6019 Purpose To summarize current evidence regarding major proposed, repurposed or experi - mental treatments for COVID-19 and to provide a summary of current clinical expe - rience and treatment guidance for COVID-19. Study design Literature Review Level of evidenceN/A Methods A literature review was performed using PubMed to identify relevant English-lan - guage articles published through March 25th, 2020. Search terms included 'corona - virus' treatment and pharma - cology. Case reports, case series, and review articles were included due to the lack of randomized controlled trials. Currently active clinical trials were also included using the disease search term 'coronavirus infection' on ClinicalTrials.gov and the in - dex of studies of novel coronavirus pneumonia in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Findings Treatment recommendations based on clinical treatment experience, descriptive reports, and case series should be interpreted with caution due to lack of clinical trials. There are currently no medical therapies that have been definitively shown to improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Several drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 virus favipiravir. Clinical ImplicationsThere is currently no effective therapy for COVID-19, and therefore there is an ur - gent need for randomized clinical trials to test the effectiveness of proposed thera - pies. Limitations To date, published data is limited to observational studies and small clinical trials with less than 250 patients. This review focused primarily on adult patients and lacks data on pediatric population infected with SARS-CoV-2. The amount of pub - lished literature is rapidly growing, and recommendations are constantly changing.TREATMENTReview by Sarah Sun, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubSARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike-RBD Structure and Receptor Bind - ing Comparison and Potential Implications on Neutralizing Anti - body Vaccine Development Chunyun Sun et al. bioRxiv February 20, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.951723 Purpose To investigate whether SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) possess cross-re - activity to SARS-CoV-2. Study design Observational study Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Sequence, macro, and microstructures were evaluated with computer analysis soft - wares. Binding kinetics, antibody cross-reactivity, and neutralization efficiency were measured by ELISA. SARS-CoV nAbs were generated by immunizing rodents with protein; two - ies and four monoclonal antibodies were analyzed for cross reactivity using ELISA. Non-Ace2-blocking antibodies were also screened for cross-reactivity using ELISA. Findings Within the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, significant differences were found in the receptor binding motifs (RBMs). SARS-CoV nAbs demonstrated little cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein, indicating a low probability of identifying efficacious cross-reactive nABs to SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV antibodies or antibody libraries. However, three ACE2-non-blocking monoclonal antibodies were found to cross-bind the SARS- CoV-2 S1 protein and cross neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at high concen - trations. Based on the two viruses' RBD structural similarities, targets for cross-reac - tive and neutralizing antibodies may be found. Clinical ImplicationsThere is a potential trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum of therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses. This paper underscores the challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants or SARs-CoV, should it re-emerge. Limitations Types of antibodies obtained in this study were limited. Future research needs to explore mechanism of neutralization for non-blocking RBD antibodies.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by John Sweeney, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubPotential Rapid Diagnostics, Vaccine and Therapeutics for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): A Systematic Review Junxiong Pang et al.

Study design Systematic Review Level of evidenceLevel 1 Methods Authors compiled the findings of 27 human studies examining the diagnostics, vac - cines, and therapeutic drugs for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Findings Nucleic acid based tests are useful for diagnosing active 2019-nCoV (a.k.a. SARS- CoV-2) infection and serological testing may be effective for determining the ex - tent of infection, including asymptomatic infection and attack rate in populations. Potential vaccines and antiviral treatment modalities for SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented based on data from trials for other corona viruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Clinical ImplicationsNucleic acid testing is useful for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection At the time of publishing of this study, there was only one vaccine that has received emergen - cy approval, and is currently being used in clinical and surveillance centers in China. Other vaccine candidates will take roughly one year to start phase 1 clinical trials. Given the absence of a vaccine and a long interval before one is available, clinicians should consult literature for optimizing treatment protocols with pre-existing or available medications. Limitations Inferences of vaccine effect on 2019-nCoV are largely based on the behavior of SARS and MERS. Most of the studies on vaccines for SARS and MERS were exclud - ed by reviewers for being performed in cell or animal models, so only four studies were ultimately included. No vaccine studies in any population type were available for 2019-nCoV specifically. In addition, no completed trials on 2019-nCoV therapeu - tics had been completed at the time of the review.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Leah Greenfield, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubThe COVID-19 vaccine development landscape Tung Thanh Le et al. Nature Reviews, Drug Discovery April 8, 2020 DOI: 10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5 Purpose To contribute to the global efforts for the development of vaccines against COVID-19 by providing an overview of current vaccine development activity. Study design Narrative Review Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods Since February of 2020, reviewers have continually monitored and reported on the COVID-19 vaccine development landscape using sources such as the World Health Organization, clinical trial databases, publicly available literature, press releases, and information from product developers. Findings There are currently 115 vaccine candidates for COVID-19 globally, 78 of which were confirmed to be in active development. Of these, 73 vaccines are in ex - ploratory stages and the remaining five are in clinical development . In clini - cal development, there are two vaccines using a non-replicating viral vector, one using recombinant protein, one using RNA, and one using DNA. In addition, at least 10 projects are investigating the use of adjuvants, which would make lower doses possible and allow more people to get vaccinated without compromising efficacy. Clinical ImplicationsThe high number of vaccine technology platforms being tested to fight COVID-19 offer hope for a safe, effective, and quickly available vaccine. In addi - tion, it is possible that multiple platforms will be successful, which would allow different patient populations to receive different vaccines depending on their age and medical conditions. Limitations Many of the technology platforms being used for development are not currently used in any licensed vaccines, raising questions about safety and efficacy in an already accelerated development landscape. In addition, these platforms may not be able to use existing production equipment to manufacture vaccines on the massive scale that may be necessary.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Leah Greenfield, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubAn effective CTL peptide vaccine for Ebola Zaire based on survivors' CD8+ targeting of a particular nucleocapsid protein epitope with potential implications for COVID-19 vaccine design CV Herst et al. BioRxIV/Vaccine March 9, 2020 Develop a CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) producing a T-cell response against EBOV (Zaire ebolavirus); determine if CTL expansion can be driven by NP43-53, an EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) peptide shown to provide pro - tective CTL-mediated immunity against EBOV in previous mouse studies; and see if this peptide is protective in an in-vivo EBOV murine challenge model. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for SARS-CoV-2. Study design Basic science/translational mouse study Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods An established microsphere-based, synthetic vaccine platform was used to im - munize C57BL/6 mice with NP43-53 or 9mer sub-sequences of NP43-53. Spleno - cytes were harvested 14 days after immunization and analyzed for IFN- release after simulation with peptide used in vaccination. Mice were then vaccinated with NP44-52 (a subsequence of NP43-53) or a control and challenged 14 days later with mouse-adapted EBOV. Findings For the splenocyte restimulation experiments, there was no significant difference in IFN- production between NP43-53 vaccinated mice and con - trol-treated mice . NP44-52-vaccination induced greater IFN- release than NP43-54 and was used for subsequent experiments . In the in vivo EBOV chal - lenge model, control-treated mice showed increasing mortality compared to vaccinated mice, which survived and showed no morbidity. Low levels of IL-6, MCP-1, IL-9, and GM-CSF and increased IFN- were found in surviving mice. Clinical ImplicationsAs a single dose of the peptide vaccine protected mice from EBOV morbidity and mortality, a CTL-mediated peptide vaccine may be feasible and efficacious for SARS-CoV-2. Limitations This is a murine study, so there is a limitation to how these findings can be ap - plied to humans. For example, the NP43-53 peptide is a mouse peptide, and a human HLA-restricted peptide would need to be determined for an effective vaccine.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Emily Beltran, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and pros - pects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics.

Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics March 18, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1735227 Purpose Highlight the ongoing advances in designing vaccines to counter COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), and focus on earlier efforts to develop a vaccine to fight hu - man coronavirus (CoV) infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Study design Review article Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods This paper served as a brief review to highlight ongoing advances in COVID-19 vaccine development and compare them with prior efforts made in history. Findings Most COVID-19 vaccine strategies target the surface-exposed spike (S) glyco - protein as the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. The possibility of de - veloping a universal COVID-19 vaccine was assessed based on the similarity in T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 shares genetic similarity with SARS-CoV, making it possible that vaccines developed for SARS-CoV can exhibit cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 . Direct administra - tion of monoclonal antibodies can help play a role in COVID-19 control. Stud - ies have shown that patients recovering from SARS display potent neutraliz - ing antibody responses. Studies have also shown that passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies induces substantial protection in mice subjected to lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Clinical ImplicationsThis study describes various designs of COVID-19 vaccine development: the S glycoprotein (recognizing the human ACE2 cellular receptor), the similarity in T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the direct administration of monoclonal antibodies. Limitations This study was limited by its lack of including suitable animal models for ana - lyzing replication, transmission, and pathogenesis.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Ahmad Gill, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubImmune responses in COVID-19 and potential vaccines: Lessons learned from SARS and MERS epidemic Eakachai Prompetchara et al. Asian Pacific Journal of Allergy and Immunology March 2020 DOI: 10.12932/AP-200220-0772 Purpose Utilize historical data from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to compare past with the present SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Aim to understand viral pathogenesis, host im - mune responses, and evasion strategies in order to inform therapeutic vaccine strategies moving forward. Study design Review article Level of evidenceN/A Methods SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 were compared using viral comparisons using demographic data, characteristics, and immunopathogenesis as a foun - dation to inform discussion of various vaccine platforms. Delivery mechinisms range from DNA, viral vector, subunit, virus-like particles, inactivated and live-at - tenuated SARS-CoV-2 shares 79% genomic similarity with SARS-CoV and 50% with MER - SCoV. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV also share the same entry receptor of ACE2, expressed on type 2 alveolar cells. Nucleic acid-based vaccines showed prom - ise in Phase I and II of trials for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (SARS-CoV-2 was not presented in this review); similar vaccines were trialed in less than one year after the Zika outbreak, depicting a hopeful timeline to therapeu - tic intervention. This platform yields advantages of rapid production, simple design, and induction of both B and T cell responses. Yet this delivery modality has disadvantages of efficient delivery system requirement and lower immune response induction compared to live vaccines. Clinical ImplicationsThis paper highlights the robust and rapid response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine de - velopment globally and suggests the pivotal role of international collaboration, preclinical studies performed in parallel with clinical trials to expediate therapu - tic timeline.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Morgan Sturgis, MS2 of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubMultiple-epitope vaccine design using an immunoinformatics ap - proach for 2019 novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2) Y e Feng et al. bioRxiv March 3, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332 Purpose Identify surface-exposed peptides of SARS-CoV-2 to design multiple-epitope vaccines. Study design Basic Science Study Level of evidenceN/A Methods Based on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 retrieved from the NCBI database, candidate B-cell epitopes were analyzed from an online tool in the Immune-Epitope-Database And Analysis-Resource. Prediction of linear B-cell epitopes and surface accessible epitopes were performed through Bepipred soft - ware and Emini tool. Prediction of T-cell epitope binding affinity to specific HLA alleles were performed through netMHCpan and prediction software iNeo-Pred. Based on B-cell and T-cell epitopes, vaccine peptides were optimized for high epi - tope count and HLA score, then designed by an in-house tool iNeo-Design. In addi - tion, an online server swiss-model was used to the predict the 3D protein structures and HLA molecules. Findings Based on 19 B-cell epitopes and 121 adjacent T-cell epitopes, 17 candidate vaccine peptides that contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes were generat - ed. 499 core T-cell epitopes were analyzed to generate 13 T-cell epitopes-only vaccine peptides. All in all, a total of 30 peptide vaccine candidates were designed to potentially cause an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. 26 of them were from the spike protein, 2 were from the membrane pro - tein, and 2 were from the envelope protein. 5 peptides were located in the receptor binding domain region, suggesting that they were likely to induce production of neutralizing antibody. Clinical ImplicationsThis study recommends multiple vaccine peptides involving B-cell and T-cell epitopes to use as potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 Limitations The study was limited in that these multiple-epitope vaccine designs require in vitro and in vivo trials to determine effectiveness of these vaccine pep - tides. In addition, this study is a preliminary report that has not been peer-re - viewed.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Audrey Sung, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubSelf-amplifying RNA SARS-CoV-2 lipid nanoparticle vaccine induces equivalent preclinical antibody titers and viral neutralization to re - covered COVID-19 patients Paul McKay et al. bioRxiv preprint April 25, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.055608 Purpose To observe the IgG response to a self-amplifying RNA SARS-CoV-2 lipid nanoparticle vac - cine generated in a murine model compared to antibody titers from recovered COVID-19 patients. Study design Randomized controlled animal trial Level of evidenceN/A Methods Mice were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The treatment group was immu - nized with self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) protein encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) in doses ranging from 0.01 g to 10 g. The positive control group received electroporated plasmid DNA, and the negative control group received saRNA encoding the rabies glycoprotein. Each group received two vaccines, one month apart. Serum samples from each group and from recovered SARS-CoV-2 human patients were collected. These samples were analyzed to measure SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG anti - body levels and ability to neutralize a pseudotyped virus. Findings High quantities of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 were found in the mouse treatment group in a dose-responsive manner. Viral neutralization was significantly more effective in the treatment group than in the positive control group. At all vaccine doses, the treatment group demonstrated significantly higher quantities of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and sig - nificantly more viral neutralization than serum derived from natural infection in humans. A positive correlation between antibody levels and levels of viral neutralization was observed in both humans and mice. Clinical ImplicationsA vaccine using saRNA encapsulated in LNP has the potential to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. This vaccine formulation was effective at stimulating a robust cytokine response in mice, suggesting that the LNP enhances the immu - nogenicity of the saRNA. In addition, the cellular immune response favored Th1 cells, which increases the likelihood that the results are translatable to humans. RNA ther - apeutics formulated with LNP are already in clinical use and require lower doses than messenger RNA drugs, easing some concerns about clinical safety. Limitations This was a mouse model and the results may not be generalizable to humans. The sam - ple size was small, with n=7 or 8 for each group, and mice within the treatment group did not all receive the same vaccine dose. This study still has to undergo peer review.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Leah Greenfield, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubIn silico Design of novel Multi-epitope recombinant Coronavirus surface bioRxiv preprint April https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.985499 Purpose To perform an in silico design a vaccine for Coronavirus based on surface glycoproteins. Study design In Silico Level of evidenceN/A Methods A multi-epitope vaccine based on surface glycoprotein was designed through application of bioinformatics methods. NCBI resources were used to gather relevant protein sequences and to determine sequence alignment. Antigenicity of the coronavirus surface glycoprotein was evaluated using Vax - iJen 2.0 server. B-cell epitopes were predicted using ElliPro and IEDB analysis resource. T-cell epitope prediction was performed using ProPred-1 server. 17 potent linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico. Then, the epitopes were joined via different linkers. The ability of selected epitopes to induce interferon-gamma was then evalu - ated using IFNepitope web server. Findings A final vaccine was constructed, which composed of 398 amino acids and at - tached to 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12. Physicochemical properties and anti - genicity in the proposed vaccine demonstrated that the vaccine was stable. Molecular docking studies confirmed that the vaccine interacted with MHC-I and MHC-II molecules as expected. Interferon-gamma analysis showed that 16/17 epitopes had the potential to produce interferon-gamma. Clinical ImplicationsThis study introduced a novel multi epitope vaccine design against Coronavi - rus. The multi-epitope vaccine with 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant was a stable construct with high aliphatic content and high antigenicity. Limitations This was an in silico study; the proposed virus must still be followed by in vi - tro and in vivo studies before proceeding. Also, this study still has to undergo peer review.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Ahmad Gill, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubPotent neutralizing antibodies in the sera of convalescent COVID-19 patients are directed against conserved linear epitopes on the SARS- CoV-2 spike protein Chek al. bioRxiv March 31, 2020 DOI: B-cell epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 virus spike glycoprotein for vaccine development. Study design Basic Science Investigational Study Level of evidenceN/A Methods Convalescent serum samples were collected from 25 patients in Singapore during the COVID-19 outbreak. Pseudotyped lentivirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein tagged with luciferase reporter was used to assess neutralizing ac - tivity of sera. Antigenic targets of sera were determined using liner B-cell peptide library for entire S protein of either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and peptide-based ELISA and antibody depletion assays. Sera from recovered SARS patients and healthy patients were used as comparisons and control groups, respectively. Findings - Six of the 25 sera samples demonstrated good neutralizing capability with IC50 scores ranging between 694-836 (one outlier; IC50 = 1603). patient sera strongly detected peptide pools S14 and S21. The individual peptides detect - ed within these pools were S14P5 and S21P2. Importantly, both peptides are localized in proximity to functionally important regions of the S protein: peptide S14P5 is localized in proximity to the RBD and S21P2 contains part of the fusion peptide sequence. Antibody-depletion assays demonstrated reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection when antibodies against the aforementioned peptides were depleted in the sera. Sera from COVID-19 patients demonstrated detection against SARS-CoV pool S51 which overlaps with SARS- CoV-2 pool S21, raising the potential of a pan-coronavirus epitope. Clinical ImplicationsThis study identifies two immunodominant B cell linear epitopes (S14P5 and S21P2) that are recognized by neutralizing antibodies and may serve as immuno - genic targets for vaccine. Limitations The study was limited by its small sample size, with only six patient samples demonstrating good neutralization capacity. Further development is necessary to create a vaccine based on this work. Also, this study still has to undergo peer re - view.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Yereida Gallardo, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal arrives, can the world make enough? Roxanne Khamsi Nature April 9, 2020 DOI: 10.1038/d41586-020-01063-8 Purpose Biomedical companies around the world are working on formulating a SARS-CoV-2 vac - cine. Most research to date has compared the numerous platforms available and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Optimistic timelines project a vaccine will be available within the next 12 to 18 months. This article seeks to address the question that follows: once a vaccine is formulated, how is the world to go about its production and equitable distribution? Study design News, review article Level of evidence5 Methods Quantitative and narrative data collection from reputable sources including: World Health Organization (WHO), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), US Pharma - copeia (USP), and several others. Findings How vaccine distribution looks will depend heavily on the delivery mechanism, which range from inactivated form to subunit to RNA/DNA based, with each formu - lation bearing its own challenges and rewards. Regardless of the platform chosen, CEPI describes a gap that needs to be unpacked: a fair allocation system. In response to pan - demics of the past, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework to coordinate the supply-demand of vaccines, diagnostics, and drugs but due to its specificity for influenza, PIP does not apply to SARS-CoV-2. The article advocates for a rapid response mimicking this framework yet addresses time to devise as a limiting factor in addition to the retroactive obtainment of samples posing a logistical threat to its success. Clinical ImplicationsThis article allows for greater understanding of the vast limitations of vaccine develop - ment beyond delivery type; touching on production costs, resource scarcity, politics, and upholding the justice pillar of medical ethics. It calls on global governments and private funders to be proactive in their response to this knowledge; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) estimates minimum $3 billion USD are needed to devel - op, trial, and manufacture, and distribute a vaccine for the world (not including estimated billions needed to fuel manufacturing plants). Limitations The inevitable limitation in our current stage of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development lies in the careful balance of efficiency and efficacy.

Study design Bioinformatics Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods The use of Q-UEL (an involved automatic surfing of the world wide web to speed access to information) systems to access relevant emerging literature, and to interact with standard publicly available bioinformatics tools on the internet. Additionally, the use of MARPLE/HDNstudent with XTRACTOR allows for specific search queries that bypass \"autosurfing\" of the internet. Findings The sequence of amino acids KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well con - served across many coronaviruses (including 2019-nCoV) and corresponds to the re - gion around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. Many conventions in diagnostic and vaccine design are not significant in coronavirus matches, however an exposed loop in the SARS coro - navirus is an important target for creating antibodies and a carrier protein is necessary to promote immunogenicity. The addition of C-terminal and N-terminal linkage se - quences resulted in the proposed L-amino sequence of GPSKRSFIEDLLFNKVTLAC as a B-epitope to be synthesized and attached to a carrier. Clinical ImplicationsKRSFIEDLLFNKV protein subsequence is seen as a potential Achilles' heel because it is exposed or potentially exposable, being required for proteolytic activation cleavage, and is also a well conserved feature on the virus. This motif seems a likely primary tar - get for synthetic vaccines and a basis for drug discovery. Limitations One must be aware of coincidental matches that are not truly significant unless one can see that the proteins being compared are essentially of the same function or fam - ily, with the order of similar sections preserved, and that the correspondences make sense. This was an in silico study; the proposed sequence must still be followed by in vitro and in vivo studies before proceeding.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Johanna Balas, MS1 Table of Contents "}
