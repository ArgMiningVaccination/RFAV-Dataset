Following the diagnosis of an active case of polio in Rockland County in July 2022, waste-water testing has revealed polio virus in samples in multiple New York State counties, including New York City. With polio circulating in New York, it is imperative that students are protected. How Do I Know If I'm Vaccinated? In the United States, the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is a core component of any childhood immunization schedule. Additionally, the New York State Department of Health requires proof of polio vaccination for all school-aged children. Many countries around the world have enacted similar policies. If you were born in the United States and have received your childhood vaccines and/or if you attended primary school in New York State, you are very likely to be fully vaccinated against polio. If you remain unsure of your vaccination status, we encourage you to check with: - Your primary care provider or pediatrician's office - Your state's Immunization Information System "}
