Information About Your Contract This section provides answers to general questions you may have about your contract. Topics include: ELIGIBILI TY End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) CANCELA TION Cancelation Rescission CONT INUATION OF BENEFITS Consolidat ed Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COB RA) Individual Coverage 2 SECTION 1: INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CONTRACT ELIG IBILITY Who is Eligible to Receive Benefits Michigan State Uni versity is responsible for determining eligibilit y. BCBSM does not make eligibility determinati ons, but updates its files to record eligib ility informat ion pr ovided by Mi chigan State University. Please contact MSU Human Re sources for eligibili ty informatio n. You mu st notify your em ployer or group if there is a change in your family such as birth, divorce, death, etc. We mu st receive noti ce from your em ployer or group within 30 days of the change so that any contra ct changes take effect as of the date of the event. Any change in rates resulting from contra ct changes will take effe ct as of the effe ctive date of the contra ct change. If a depend ent becomes ineligible for coverage under your contra ct, as in t he case of a divorce, the dependent may be eligib le for his or her own contract. Howe ver, MSU Human Resources must be notified within 30 da ys of the change in order to p rovide continuous coverage. You may al so req uest group coverage for yourself or your dependents within 60 da ys of the following event: Your Medi caid coverage or your dependents' CHIP coverage (Children's Health In surance Program) is terminated due to lo ss of eligibilit y. SECTION 1: INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CONTRACT 3 End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) We coordi nate with Medicare to pay for ESRD treatment. This includes hemodial ysis and peritoneal dialysis. The member should apply for Medicare to keep costs down. Dialysis services must be provided in: A participating hospital A participating freestanding ESRD facility In the home. Note: The member should apply for Medicare to keep costs down; otherwi se he or she will be responsible for paying the cost of ESRD treatment (see page 132). When Medicare Coverage Begins If you have ESRD, your Medicare starts on the first day of the fourth month of dialysis. Example: Dialysis begins February 12. Medicare coverage begins May 1. The time before Medicare coverage begins is the \"Medicare waiting period.\" It lasts for three months. There is no waiting period if you begin self-dialysis training within three months of when your dialysis starts. If so, Medicare coverage begins the first day of the month you begin dialysis. There is no waiting period if you go in the hospital for a kidney transplant or services you need before the transplant. (The hospital must be appro ved by Medicare.) Medicare coverage begins the first day of the month you go in. You must receive your transplant within three months of going in the hospital. Sometimes transplants are delayed after going in the hospital. If it is delayed more than two months after you go in the hospital, Medicare coverage begins two months before the month of your transplant. When BCBSM Coverage is the Primary or Secondary Plan If you have BCBSM group coverage through your job and you are entitl ed to Medicare because you have ESRD, BCBSM is your primary plan. That means BCBSM pays for all covered services for up to 33 months. (The three months \"waiting period\" and 30 months \"coordination period\".) After the coordination period, Medicare is your primary plan and pays for all covered services. The coordi nation period may be less than 30 months. The medical evidence report your physician fills out helps deter mine how long it is. 4 SECTION 1: INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CONTRACT End Stage Renal Dise ase (ESRD) (continued) Dual Entitl ement If you have dual entitl ement to Medicare and have employer group coverage, the following applie s: If you are entitled to Medicare because you have ESRD and Your entitl ement starts at the same time or before you are entitled to Medicare because of your age or disability, Your employer health plan is the primary plan. It is primary until the end of the 30-month coordination period. Example: You retired at age 62 and kept your employer health plan as a retiree. You start dial ysis on June 12, 2014. (This begins the three -month waiting period.) On Sept. 1, 2014 you become entitled to Medicare because you have ESRD. (This begins the 30-month coordinat ion period.) Your 65th birthday is in February 2015. On your birthday you also become entitled to Medicare because you turn 65. Since you turned 65 during the 30 months (instead of before), your employer plan is your primary plan for the entire 30 months. On March 1, 2017 Medicare becomes your primary plan. If you become entitled to Medicare because you have ESRD after you are entitled to Medicare because of your age or disability: Your employer health plan is your primary plan for the 30 month coordi nation period if: You are \"working aged\" You are \"working disabled\" Example: You became entitled to Medicare in June 2012 when you turned 65. You are still wor king. You have employer health coverage. Your employer coverage is your pri mary plan. On May 27, 2014, you are diagno sed with ESRD and begin dial ysis. On Aug. 1, 2014 (after 3 months) you again become entitled to Medicare be cause you have ESRD. Your employer health plan remains your primary plan through Jan. 31, 2017. Medicare becomes primary on Feb. 1, 2017. If you are not a working aged or working disabled individual in the first month of dual entitle ment, Medicare is your primary plan. Example: You retired at age 62. You have employer health coverage as a retiree. You turn 65 in Augu st 2014 and become entitled to Medicare. Medicare is now your pri mary plan. You are diagno sed with ESRD in January 2015. You start dialysis. On April 1, 2015, you again become entitled to Medicare because you have ESRD. Medicare remains your primary plan permanentl y.SECTION 1: INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CONTRACT 5 CANCELAT ION How to Cancel Coverage Send your written reque st to terminate coverage to your employer.

You will have to repay BCBSM for its pa yment for any services you received during this period. CONTINUA TION OF BENEF ITS Conso lidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) COBRA is a federal law that applies to most employers with 20 or more employees.

(\"Qualif ying events\" are listed on page 171) Your employer must send you a COBRA notice. You have 60 days to choose to continue your coverage. The deadline is 60 da ys after you lose coverage or 60 days after your employer sends you the notice, whichever is later. If you choose to keep the group coverage you must pay for it. The periods of time you may keep it for are: 18 months of coverage for an employee who is ter minated, other than for gross miscondu ct, or whose hours are reduced 29 months of coverage for all quali fied benefi ciaries if one member is deter mined by the Social Security Administration to be disabled at the time of the qualif ying event or within 60 days thereafter 36 months of coverage for qualified benefi ciaries in case of the death of the employee, divorce, legal separati on, loss of dependen cy status, or employee entitl ement to MedicarSECTION 1: INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CONTRACT 7 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) (continued) COBRA coverage can be terminated because: The 18, 29 or 36 months of COBRA coverage end The requir ed premium is not paid on time The employer terminates its group health plan The qualifi ed benefi ciary becomes entitled to Medicare coverage The qualifi ed benefi ciary obtains coverage under a group health plan.

They include, but are not limited to, hospitals, other facilities, physicians, licensed clinics, labs, and health care profe ssionals. Our payment policy is shown in the chart below. Participating Providers BCBSM sends payment directly to participating providers. They accept this payment plus cost sharing, if any as payment in full for covered services. Nonparticipating Providers Nonpa rticipating physicians and other profe ssional providers \u2014 BCBSM will send the payment directly to you. You will need to pay the physician. Nonparticipating hospitals - BCBSM will not pay for medical services from nonparti cipating hospitals unless it is for the treatment of accident al injuri es or medical emergen cies. Otherwi se, you will need to pay most of those charges yourself. Nonparticipating other facilities and alternative to hospital care providers* -- BCBSM will not pay for services from nonparti cipating facilities and alternati ve to hospital care providers. * Home health care, home infusion therapy, hospice care, and care in a skilled nursing facility are some of the alternat ives to a hospital. BCBSM has business contracts with different types of providers. Each type of provider has separate payment practices. In this section we will describe the payment practices that we have with the following types of providers: Participating Physicians and Other Professional Providers Nonpart icipating Physicians and Other Providers Participating Hospitals, Facilities and Alternati ve to Hospital Care Providers Nonparti cipating Hospitals, Facilities and Alternative to Hospital Care Providers Emergen cy Services at a Nonparti cipating Hospital Hospital Services that You Must Pay Out-of-Area Services BlueCar d\u00ae Program Negotiated (non-BlueCard Progra m) National Account Arrange ments Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program120 SECTION 4: HOW PROVIDERS ARE PAID Participating Physicians and Other Professional Providers For services you receive from a participating provider, we pay the provider directly. They agree to accept our appro ved amount as payment in full. You pay only your deductible and coinsurance. This is described in Section 2. If you need to know what providers are paid directly, call us at one of the numbers listed in Section 8: \"How to Reach Us\" section. A participating provider, other than an M.D., D.O., podiatri st, chiropra ctor or fully licensed psychologi st may bill you when: You receive a service not covered by your contra ct You acknowledge in writing before you receive the service that we will not cover it because it is medically unne cessary or experimental and you agree to receive the service and pay for it, and We deny a claim from a parti cipating provider that was submitted more than two years after the services because you did not furnish needed information The provider gives you an estimate of what the services will cost you. Participating providers may also bill you if you do not provide the required identif ying information in a timely manner so the provider can file a claim. We may deny a claim from a participating provider that was sent in more than two years after the service because you did not furnish needed information.

Balan ces in excess of our appro ved amount.SECTION 4: HOW PROVIDERS ARE PAID 121 Nonpar ticipating Physicians and Other Providers If the provider is nonpa rticipating , you will need to pay most of the charges yourself. Your bill could be substantial. After paying your provider, you should submit a claim to us. If we appro ve the claim, we will send the payment to you. Note: Because nonparti cipating providers often charge more than our payment, our payment to you may be less than the amount charged by the provider. Some nonparticipating profe ssional providers may agree to participate on a claim by claim basis. This means that they will accept our appro ved amount, after your dedu ctible and coinsurances have been met, as payment in full for a service they have provided. The provider will submit a claim to us and we will send the payment to the nonparti cipating provider. Note: If you receive services that require preappro val from a provider who does not parti cipate with us, and the provider does not get the preap proval before those services are received, you will have to pay the bill yourself. We will not pay for it. It is important to make sure that the nonparti cipating provider gets that preappro val before you receive the services. The nonparti cipating providers listed below do not participate with BCBSM on a per claim basis: Independent physical therapists Certified nurse practitioners Independent occupatio nal therapi sts Independent speech-language pathologists Audiologi sts122 SECTION 4: HOW PROVIDERS ARE PAID Participating Hospitals, Other Facilities and Alternative to Hospital Care Providers If the provider is partic ipating , we will make payment directly to the provider. Almost all Michigan hospitals and many alternative to hospital providers participate with BCBSM. The provider accepts our payment as payment in full, less any coinsurances or dedu ctible you are required to pay. You do not need to pay any amounts beyond coinsurances and dedu ctibles that apply for services covered by your certificate as long as they are medically necessary (except in limited cases described on Page 124). Even if the provider's charge for a covered service is more than our payment, you will not need to pay the differen ce. Participating providers may bill you for a service that is medically unne cessary or experimental but only if you acknowledge in writing before you receive the service that we will not cover the service because it is medically unnecessary or experimental and you agree to receive the service and pay for it. If you need to know if a provider participate s, ask your doctor, the provider's admitting staff, or call us. (Use the numbers listed in Section 9: \"How to Reach Us\".) Nonpa rticipating Hospitals, Other Facilities and Alternative to Hospital Care Providers If the provider is nonpa rticipating , you will need to pay most of the charges yourself. Your bill could be substantial because BCBSM coverage at nonpart icipating hospitals is limited to services needed to treat an accidental injury or medical emergen cy. To receive payment for covered services provided by a nonparti cipating hospital, you will need to send us a claim.

The followi ng explains your coverage when provided by a nonparti cipating hospital: Emergency Services at a Nonparticipating Hospital We will make payment, less any member cost-sharing amounts, for emergen cy services provided by an accredited nonparticipating hospital: Located outside of Michigan in areas not served by another Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan Located in Michigan but not participating with another Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan Participating with another Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan, regardle ss of the facility's location Our payment for emergen cy services is the greater of the following: The median in-network rate The usual, customary and reasonable rate, or The Medicare rate.124 SECTION 4: HOW PROVIDERS ARE PAID Hospital Services That You Must Pay You are required to pay for the following services: Services that are not included in this certificate Services that are not covered because they are medically unnecessary or experimental if you agree to receive them after being advised by hospital staff that they will not be covered and you agree in advance and in writing to pay for them In some cases, you are required to pay for services that are medical ly necessa ry. These limited cases are: When you do not inform the hospital that you are a BCBSM member either at the time of ad mission or within 30 days after you are discharged When you fail to provide the hospital with information to identify your coverage BlueCard\u00ae Program We participate in inter-plan arrange ments with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans. These agreements operate under rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. This progr am offers medical bene fits to Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield members when they are out of their local service area, such as out of state. The Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan that pays for those covered services for you is your Host Plan. BCBSM will pay the Host Plan for the services it covered. Howe ver, the Host Plan is responsible for contracting with its participating providers and making sure they receive payment. All types of claims can be processed through these inter-plan arrangement s, except for the following: Dental care claims that are not paid as medical claims/benef its. Prescription drug benefi ts or vision care benefits that are administered by a third party contra cted by BCBSM to provide those specific service or services.SECTION 4: HOW PROVIDERS ARE PAID 125 BlueCard Program (continued) BlueCard Participating Providers If you receive covered services in another service area from a BlueCa rd participating provider: The provider will file your claim with the Host Plan. The Host Plan will pay the provider according to its contract with the provider. When you receive covered services outside our service area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Progra m, your dedu ctible, copayment and coinsurance will be based on the lower of: The billed charges for your covered services; or The negotia ted price that the Host Plan has made available to us This \"negot iated price\" will be one of the followi ng: A simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Plan pays to your provider. An estimated price that takes into account special arrange ments with your provider or provider group that may include settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charge s. An average price based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. The Host Plan will determine what pricing it will use. The Host Plan can negotiate with the provider to deter mine the price for each service. Howe ver, under the terms of the BlueCard Progra m, the price the Host Plan uses will be the final price that you are responsible for. There will be no pricing adjustment once that price has been determined. Estimated and average pricing also include adjustments we may need to make to estimates of past pricing for transaction changes noted above. These adjustments will not affect the price we pay for your claim because they are not applied to claims already paid.126 SECTION 4: HOW PROVIDERS ARE PAID BlueCard Program (continued) BlueCard Participating Providers (continued) Laws in other states may require the Host Plan to add a surcharge to your claim. If you receive services in a state that imposes such a fee, we will calculate what you need to pay according to the appli cable laws of that state. Note: BCBSM may process claims for covered services through a negotiated account arrange ment with one or more Host Plans as an alternati ve to BlueCard. In those instances, the negotiat ed terms will deter mine the payment amount. Your cost share will be calculated based on the negotiated priced or the lower of either the billed amount or the negotiated price. Note: We have included a factor for bulk distributions from Host Plans in your premium for Value -Based Progra ms when appli cable under this agreement. If your coverage contai ns referen ce-based bene fits, special rules apply. Referen ce-based benefits are those that have dollar limits for specific procedures. These limits are based on a Host Plan local market rates. You will be responsible for paying the amount the provider bills above the specific reference benefit limit for a given procedure. For a participating provider, that amount will be the difference between the nego tiated price and the referen ce benefit limit. For a nonparti cipating provider, that amount will be the differen ce between the provider's billed charge and the reference benef it limit. Where a referen ce benefit limit exceeds either a negot iated price or a provider's billed charge, you will incur no additional liability, other than any appli cable cost sharing required in your certificate or riders. BlueCard PPO Out-of-Network Providers If you have a CMM-PPO Rider, the following will apply: If the provider is not a Host Plan PPO network provider and does not participate with the Host Plan, we will only pay our out-of-network provider amount, and you will be responsible for the differen ce, unless: You needed care for an accidental injury or a medical emergen cy (see Emergen cy Services in Section 7 \"Definition s\"). BlueCard PPO providers may not be available in some areas. In areas where they are not available, you can still receive BlueCard PPO benefits if you receive services from a BlueCard participating provider. The Host Plan must notify BCBSM of the provider's status.SECTION 4: HOW PROVIDERS ARE PAID 127 BlueCard Program (continued) Nonparti cipating Providers Outside Our Service Area An out-of-area provider that does not participate with the Host Plan may require you to pay for services at the time they are provided.

Submit an itemized statement to us for the services. We will pay you the amount specified under this certificate for covered services provided by a nonparti cipating provider.

Member Liability Calc ulation When you receive covered services outside of our service area from nonparti cipating providers, the amount you pay for these services will gene rally be based on eithe r: What the Host Plan pays its nonpart icipating providers or The price required by appli cable state or federal law In these cases, you may have to pay the differe nce between the amounts the nonpart icipating provider bills and the amount that BCBSM paid for the service. Exceptions In some situation s, we may use other payment methods to deter mine the amount we will pay for services rendered by nonparti cipating providers. These methods may include: Billed covered charges The payment we would make if the services were provided in our service area A special negotiated payment In these cases, you may have to pay the differe nce between the amounts the nonpart icipating provider bills and the amount we will pay for the covered services.128 SECTION 4: HOW PROVIDERS ARE PAID BlueCard Program (continued) Specialty Providers in the BlueCard Program The Host Plan can pay for you to get medical care from providers who offer special services (e.g., Allerg ist, Chiropra ctor, Podiat rist) within the Host Plan's area, even if the provider offers a specialty that BCBSM does not cover. As long as the Host Plan contra cts with the specialty provider, the services they provide to you will be paid.

Negotiated (non -BlueCard Progra m) Arrangements As an alternative to the BlueCard Program, we may process your claims for covered services through an arrange ment that we have negotiated with a Host Plan. The amount you pay for covered services under this arrang ement will be calculated based on the: Negotiated price or Lower of either the billed charges or the negotia ted price that the Host Plan has made a vailable to usSECTION 4: HOW PROVIDERS ARE PAID 129 Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program If you are living or traveling outside of the United State s, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Progr am will assist you in getting covered health care services.
