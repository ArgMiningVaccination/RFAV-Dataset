The notice is considered delivered 48 hours after mailing, if proof is not established sooner. - The abortion may be performed 24 hours after the notice has been delivered if the parent(s) or guardian(s) state in writing that they do not wish to consult with the minor or that they have been previously informed. - Minors are required to sign a form stating that they consent \"freely and without coercion\" to the abortion. If the physician or physician's qualified agent elects not to comply with the parental notification requirements, or the parent or legal guardian cannot be located, the minor or minor's next friend can petition any juvenile court in the state to have the parental notification requirements waived.
