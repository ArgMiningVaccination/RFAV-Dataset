Nearly 795,000 people in the U.S. will have a stroke this year \u2014 the cause being hypertension of course. The sad part is that it often remains unsuspected until it strikes a fatal blow. The only way to reduce this rate is to spread knowledge and awareness regarding how to lower blood pressure.

Pr Web: www,prweb,com MoSt PatieNtS SeeK ChiroPraCtorS because of some form of pain or discomfort that is markedly affecting their daily activities at work or play.Complaints of low back pain, neckpain, whiplash, or headaches areamong the most common, but otherneuromusculoskeletal (NMS) issues are frequently encountered as well. 1 Chiropractors, in turn, are well versed in the treatment of suchconditions via manipulation, massage,exercise, and nutrition. And a varietyof studies have supported the use ofchiropractic and manipulation for theresolution of NMS complaints. However, a lack of scientifically validated metrics hinders a broaderacceptance of the success of variouspain-reducing therapeutic strategies. One solution to this problem is to focus less attention on measuring thepain symptomatology itself and moreattention on the degree to which thepain is affecting the patients' general quality of life. Specifically, sincerestorative sleep is often one of the firstcasualties of NMS pain, an emphasison the resolution of pain-related sleepcomplaints is warranted. Studies show that 50 percent to nearly 90 percent of patients withchronic pain complain of significant sleep disturbance. 2Furthermore, it has been established that the greater theamount of sleep disruption, the lowerthe pain threshold becomes. 3This means that even the most efficacioustreatments for NMS discomfort may be compromised by sleep difficulties. Thecaseforvalidated sleepanalysis In light of these facts, the addition ofvalidated sleep analysis to the clinicalassessment regime can serve at leasttwo important functions: The first is aquantification of the degree of overallpatient discomfort (i.e., greater sleepdisturbances indicative of greater NMS pain); and the second is a post- treatment indication of the degree to which NMS therapeutic interventionsare successful (which is valuable to both the patient and the practitioner). Up to now, however, conducting this kind of sleep assessment has been problematic. At one extreme, in-house polysomnographic studies that requirean overnight stay in a specialized facility while electroencephalographic, elec-tromyographic, and electrooculographicdata are recorded are too expensive and too inconvenient. And at the other extreme, simple questionnaire-based,self-reported sleep assessments are inaccurate and unreliable. Recent advances in wrist-actigraphic and computerized modelingtechnologies, however, have led to the development of sleep evaluation techniques that are well within yourreach and that of your clientele. In addition, these advances offer a user-Sleepassessmentmadesimple The arrival of compact wrist-actigraphic technology offers a user-friendly and affordable way for you to evaluate sleep disruption and its effects.

The new wrist-actigraphic technologies offer easy-to-use toolsthat convert simple wrist movements,sampled 16 times per second, intoaccurate and actionable informationabout sleep quantity, sleep quality, andsleep/wake timing. A typical devicewill be waterproof, shock-resistant,durable, and can be worn comfortably in the form of a wristwatch for extended periods (Figure 1); a typical data-collection period lasts a week. The actigraphic analysis can generate a three-part report that shows the patient's day-to-day sleep history, average overall sleep quality, and the cognitive/performance impactof his or her sleeping habits. The report makes it relatively easy to identify the extent to which NMS pain and discomfort is creating sleep problems and, following treatment interventions, the report can demonstrate treatmentefficacy. This cutting-edge approach offers a way for patients to discover thepresence of correctable sleep issues that may be unwittingly degrading their overall quality of life. Some people findthey need to lengthen their average sleep duration, others have to work oneliminating sleep-disrupting environmental factors, and still others learn the importance of establishing more consistent bedtimes and wakeuptimes. All of these factors impact day-to-day well-being, but until a personalized report shows the extent ofthe impact, there often is little or no motivation for change. Furthermore, without some type ofdirect feedback, the success of chiropractic treatments or basic sleepoptimization strategies is difficult tojudge. The actigraphy system helps solve these problems by placing the power of an individualized sleep andfatigue assessment in your hands. Actigraphy-basedsleep datacollection Although the assessment of sleep with a simple wristwatch-like device may sound too good to be true, there is a great deal of evidence supporting the validity of actigraphy-based sleepanalysis. Actigraphy has been endorsedby the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and others as \"an acceptably accurate estimate of sleep patterns in normal, healthy adult populations andin patients suspected of certain sleep disorders,\" 4and studies have shown that actigraphic assessments are superior tosubjective sleep evaluations. 5 figure \u0004\u0004\u0004 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 14, 2011 WWW.CHIROECO.COMCLINICAL CONCERNS Comparisons between polysomnographically based hypnograms and one of tonearly a 95-percent level. 6 An actigraphy-based system provides an accurate sleep assessment without thehassle and expense of polysomnography.While it is not possible for this type of device to diagnose sleep disorders, it makes it easy to objectively quantify sleep complaints and the degree to which effective treatments resolve those complaints. Sleepreportandcognitive effectivenessanalysis In addition, an actigraphy system that automatically processes the objectivelyassessed sleep history through a validated computer model, such as theSleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness (SAFTE) model, highlights the impact of sleep difficulties on cognitive performance and effectiveness. Actigraphy-based cognitive effectiveness reports include a tabular display that illustrates the percentage of waking time being spent at each of various cognitive-effectiveness levels ranging from 100 (highly effective) tobelow 50 (significantly impaired). SeeFigure 2 on next page. An independent 2004 evaluation of several models ranked SAFTE the highest in terms of accurately predicting the average cognitive decrements and subjective fatigueassociated with sleep restriction. 7 Thebottomline Providing clients with a single reportthat combines an objective sleepanalysis with a cognitive-effectivenesssummary can be an attractive and affordable strategy for including sleep evaluations in routine clinicalassessments. And there is significant evidence that such assessments are of interest to today's consumers. In fact, an actigraphy-based device recently made available for a consumertrial conducted in Canada showed that two-thirds of the sample participants were drawn into a specific retail outlet expressly for the opportunity to have access to an easy-to-use, convenient,and accurate sleep assessment withoutthe obtrusiveness of polysomnography (which typically records at least 12channels of data requiring a minimum of 22 wire attachments to the patient). If you are interested in including sleep assessments in your practice, examine the recent scientific literature concerning the importance of sleep forquality of life, safety, and performance as well as the proven connections between sleep and NMS status. Next, consider the feasibility of including the newest sleep technology \u0004\u0004 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 14, 2011 WWW.CHIROECO.COMCLINICAL CONCERNS in your day-to-day practice. From both a business standpoint and a treatment-efficacy standpoint, the benefits ofsleep assessment are considerable. An industry-oriented trial completed in Australia revealed thatnearly 95 percent of those whoparticipated in a fatigue-managementprogram were either \"satisfied\" or\"very satisfied\" with the actigraphy-based technology. Recent data alsoindicate that there is growing interestfrom within the professional sportsand corporate wellness communities.The importance of sleep is becoming more widely recognized andthe inclusion of sleep evaluations inhealth-related activities is growing. 2Smith MT, Haythornthwaite JA.

PalmerCollege of Chiropractic's ViceChancellor for Research and HealthPolicy, Christine Goertz, DC, PhD,wanted to find a way for the PalmerCenter for Chiropractic Research toparticipate in this study. Even with her extensive background inconducting government- funded clinical trials, shesaw that responding tothis request wouldbe a tremendouschallenge. The key to a successfulresponsewould bethe formation of ateam with the resources needed to execute the project. \"We were excited about working with the Samueli Institute on this project,\" Goertz says,\"because they have a lot of experiencein conducting research in the military.\" The Samueli Institute is currently conducting a research program oncomplementary and alternativemedicine for the military, called MIL-CAM.

The primary clinical trial, examining chiropractic's effectiveness at relieving low-back pain in active duty service members, will involve 850 army and navy personnel studied at four locations. It will also look at the effectiveness of a smoking cessation program delivered bydoctors of chiropractic.

Similar to athletes who seek advice to improve performance \u2014you are seeking advice to improve yourbusiness. Knowingwhatyouneed Once you decide to use outside help,the first step is to be clear about twospecific concepts: 1.Yourcommitment. You will need to commit to a few hours a week inmeetings or conducting the providedexercises. Most importantly, many ofthe exercises, resources, and tools youwill use require you to step outside ofyour comfort zone.2.Yourgoals. Specifically define what you want to alter and why. It is necessary to think in terms of a project manager to help you determine timeframes, revenue goals, and others involved. As the goals are written, there should be a better understanding of trends that will define your need. For example: There might be an initial need to work on receivables orcustomer service, but the trends mayillustrate a more pressing demand for marketing or strategy.

Thefollowing four conceptsshould help you: /trianglertLook for someone willingto listen but who also asksquestions. /trianglertThe right person will speak of results andconcepts, not \"off-the-shelf\" solutions. /trianglertDetermine if the person is assertive and willing toprovide you with honestfeedback. /trianglertReview \"scripted\" replies versus answers that makeyou \"think differently\" about issues. Establishing a relationship will take several meetings, so schedule three or four get-togethers to help you getcomfortable. If you aren'tconvinced after the third meeting, move on toanother candidate. Additionalassessments As you continue to establish a relationship, there areother criteria to consider when choosing a consultant. 1.Questioningskills. When engaging with the consultant,look for questions that focusspecifically on practice objectives, measurements forsuccess, and results. Beware of consultants who ask rote questions like,\"What keeps you up atnight?\" Those are the signsof an elementary consultantwho will likely not aid yourpractice. Seek out those who make you think about yourpractice and its realities, andwho will guide you to the\"true\" issue. 2.Results. There are too many chiropractors whoconcern themselves with industry expertise. The consultant is not there toalign spinal cords. Seek theirstrategic council for thepractice and focus ongetting results. Good consultants must illustrate their work with others. Review client testi- monials, case studies, whitepapers, and position papers that discuss the examples andillustrate improvements in the client's condition. The focus should be on the client \u2014 not the consultant. 3.Referralsintheageof customer-to-customer influence. When seeking a consultant, ask your peersand colleagues. You reduceyour workload when youfind consultants recom- mended by others who achieved the same resultsyou seek. \u0004\u0004 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 14, 2011 WWW.CHIROECO.COMMARKETING MATTERS 4.Professionalism. When hiring a consultant, you deserve and should desire a consummate professional.Consultants should dress, act, andspeak in a manner that expresses theirvalue. 5.Education/background/results. While there is less need to be worried aboutindustry experience, consultantsshould be able to show you past resultsand some related work. You deserve someone with analyticalskills, proper reasoning, and great assertiveness. However, there should be a history of work with others andresults to match. 6.Supportingmaterials. While meeting with consultants, review theirrespective websites and blogs. See howthey articulate their message and what others are saying about them. Also, consider reviewing their skills with follow-up tests. For example: Do they return calls or respond to emails when they say theywill and in a timely manner? Additionally, correspondence should articulate and summarize your meetings and propose intended solutions. 7.Fees. A best practice for any consultant seeking to improve your practice'scondition is to charge a fixed flat fee. The fee should be based on your objectives, key performance measure-ments, and the value for your practice. Any consultant who works for an hourly rate is probably doing it for their own benefit \u2014 not yours. Consultants should be paid for value, notfor the number of minutes you meet. Ultimately, you want an individual who thinks objectively and quickly frames issues to develop alternatives. Good consultants make you think about what you're doing and provide solutions that help you lighten your workload and enjoy being a chiropractor. The way to find the right consultant is to take your time. Great consultants lessen labor, initiate new strategies, and provide better future decisions andrevenue. 14, 2011 WWW.CHIROECO.COMaSaNeW ChiroPraCtor : accompanying your nearly eight years of education are all the loans that come with them. You can finally make money, rather than have it sucked out of your walletat every turn. But your school is notgoing to give you a set of office keys togo with that diploma. While opening a small business is never easy, there are some commonsteps you can follow \u2014 and pitfalls towatch out for \u2014 when making yourtransition from student to chiropractor. 1.Meetwithprofessionals. Despite the cost, consulting with people who knowhow to set up your business will saveyou from a headache down the road. You may have taken a business class or two in school, but actually runninga business can be more complicatedthan those lectures led you to believe.An accountant will help you get on the right foot financially, and adviseyou on what you need to monitor.Proper bookkeeping means that come tax time, there is that much less to worry about when you're trying to get everything in order. An attorney will help you determine what you want your company'sstructure to be, depending on whatyour personal needs are. You can alsocontact an outside party that may offera cheaper option to hiring a lawyer tohelp start your business. 2.Researcheverything. You probably got your fill of research as a student,but you need to be willing to go theextra mile while following the steps tobuilding your business. Ask yourself where you are going to set up your office. Is the marketcompletely saturated withchiropractors? Or are you the only onefor miles? Consumers will tend to gravitate toward established practices rather than newer ones, so make sure other offices don't surround you. When you have a good idea for a building or office space, drive to it. Was it easy to find? You want potential customers to be able to find you. 3.Establishagoodbusinessplan. This goes hand in hand with doing yourresearch. Most graduates will probablyleave with a mock business plan from a business course they took in school. Don't rely on that. Getting a loan is harder than ever, so a quick outline of what you want todo and the approach you're going totake will likely not wow potential loan providers. Know what it is going to cost toNewbeginnings Starting your first practice can be intimidating. But like anything else, preparation, focus, and hard work are the key to success. BY DEBORAH S.

List any equip- ment, employees, office rent, etc., thatwill cost you money. Shop around anddo not be afraid to look at usedequipment. The supplies you choose to buy will likely reflect your own personal beliefsabout chiropractic, so be sure to knowwhat you are looking for. With prices set, realistically outline what you want your revenue to be andwhat goals you want to meet along theway. Overestimate costs andunderestimate revenue. That way, youwill be pleasantly surprised and not frantically searching for coinsunderneath your couch cushions. Most small business owners do not make as much money their first year as they initially thought they would. Be patient if your growth is slower thanyou hoped. As long as it is a steadygrowth, you are likely on your way to having a self-sufficient business. 4.Marketyourself. This is going to be one of the most difficult aspects of starting your business \u2014 particularly because of the industry you are in. Traditional approaches to advertising are typically not suitable forhealthcare providers. You can usemedia such as television and radio if you can afford it; however, mostconsumers will not look for healthcare recommendations from these sources. The best way to get new clients is by word-of-mouth referrals. Establish a clientele before you begin to grow insize. One method of doing this is by getting into the community. See if there is a public event where you can set up a booth and give free consultations. Be able to accept walk-ins as well. While an appointment will be neededeventually, it is better at this initial stage to be more freely available. Finally, network with other local healthcare professionals and referralsare likely to follow. Although you're considered a healthcare provider, remember that, at the core, your practice will be a smallbusiness. So be prepared for everythingthat goes into running one. You'll need to keep financial data, file forms with the government, andreach out to your customers. Above all else, be resilient. If run properly, your business will surely grow. DEBORAH S. 14, 2011 WWW.CHIROECO.COMInnovativeIdeasfromtheIndustryLeaders the effiCaCy of a ChiroPraCtiC adJuStMeNt iS CertaiNly No SeCret ,But even chiropractors and other alternative healthcare physi- cians are constantly seeking new andeffective ways to complement theircraft; whether it's for patients to use athome or for use in the office directlyafter an adjustment. Pain-relief supplements are not only an appropriate way to add value toyour practice, but they are a natural way to give your patients more of whatthey seek \u2014\"right now\" relief. \"Natural products like white willow bark are an excellent choice for pain and discomfort associated with low back pain, sports injuries, disc pain, knee injuries and sciatica to name a few, and they don't have the same negative issues with the liver, kidneys, stomach, and GI tract,\" says Jeffrey Dickhut, DC, clinic director at Allied Health Group. \"These help support the adjustments, decompression, computerized rehabil- itation, and other treatments we do in our office, and I know the patient doesn't have to go to the drug store tobuy something over the counter as apain killer that may have negative long- term health consequences for them.\" And because the risks are so great with NSAIDs and prescription medication, the choice to use alternativepain-relief supplements should be a natural one like white willow bark. \"A lot of my patients are always concerned about pain, but one of thefirst things we discuss is that pain is your body's way of telling you some-thing isn't right, like a smoke detector,\"says Dickhut. \"We don't just want totake the batteries out of the smokedetector, because then we wouldn'tknow if the house was burning down.The body is the same way with pain.\" So, finding the source of the problem remains the primary course ofaction, but providing relief withnatural pain relievers may be an idealcomplementary protocol untiladjustments, decompression, and othertreatments resolve the issue. \"Since connective tissues are proteins, it has been shown thatproteolytic enzymes like bromelain, forexample, can help with the process oftissue repair and speed healing,\" says Dickhut. \"Most patients are concernedwith the pain only, and while it is important to address pain in acomplementary manner, for long termresults we want to ensure the injury has a chance to heal properly.\" Mark King, DC, president of Motion Palpation Institute, says that there is aspecific process for healing injuries \u2014 from herniated discs and rotator cufftears, to plantar fasciitis and sprained ankles \u2014 properly and naturally. After the initial injury, King says the natural progression isinflammation, adhesion formation,collagen cross linkage, scarring, and finally degeneration. He is quick to point out, however, that whileinflammation is part of healing, \"toomuch inflammation or chronicinflammation is a problem.\" Adding natural products like bromelain can minimize the healing time by reducing excessive fibrindeposition and facilitate tissue healingafter injury.

While a patient's diet alone can lead to inflammation, both Dickhut andKing say that it's not only important tobe mindful of the harm chronicinflammation can cause, but thatnatural pain-relief products are aneffective way to help control it. Dickhut agrees, saying \"Natural products give an anti-inflammatorykickstart to the patient for currentproblems, and can put them at anadvantage for being able to handlephysical stresses better in the future.\" Something, he says, other pain-relief approaches may not fully accomplish. \"Ice and topical analgesics help reduce new inflammation, \" Dickhutsays. \"With a lot of the chronicproblems I see, there is a component ofchronic inflammation, and some ofthese products [pain-relief supplements]are able to help reduce the inflammationat a cellular level. This helps provide thebuilding blocks to repair these damagedareas. This 'natural chemistry' solution isable to help the body heal.\" As important as it is for a pain-relief supplement to be natural, King wantsto highlight the importance of qualityas well. \"One key thing I emphasize is product quality,\" he says. \"And the supplement world is unregulated. Thecompany I use also manufacturespharmaceuticals, which means thestandards used from start to finishexceed the requirements forsupplement manufacturing. No othercompany does that.

BY LAURA LAING You are freshly graduated from chiropractic school, your diploma is framed, and your head isswimming with the things you've learned. Rattle off the anatomy of the spine? You can do that in your sleep. Manipulation techniques? You've gotthem down cold. Distinguish primarypain from secondary? Easy-peasy. With a solid clinical education under your belt, you are more thanready to open up your own practice,right? Not so fast. Yes, you may have top-notch skills and an enviable bedside manner, butunless you employ some basic businessknow-how, your practice will likely failwithin the first six months. That'sbecause building a new practice dependson skills you weren't taught in school. \"The schools do their jobs \u2014 preparing students to be clinicians,\"explains Stuart Bernsen, DC. \"But it's abig investment to open up a practice,and the majority of new practitionersdon't succeed.\" That may be a scary statistic, but take heart. Knowing this fact is the first step to overcoming huge challenges.\"When done right you can have a very successful practice,\" says PamelaJohnson. \"Being a chiropractor is a privilege and one of the best profes- sions out there. The rewards areendless.\" In other words, starting a new practice is well worth the hard work. But first, it's a good idea to have a solid understanding of business principles. Getsomebusinesssense \"Chiropractors think they'rechiropractors,\" says they're small business owners.\" Understand this and you're more than halfway there. The fact is, muchof what you'll be doing every day \u2014especially during your first year \u2014 willhave more to do with running yourbusiness than treating patients. And,unfortunately, you probably weren'twell prepared for that. \"You can be the best doctor in the world, but if you have no businesssense, you won't make it,\" says JeremyBrubaker, DC, who graduated from chiropractic school in 2004 andopened his clinic the following year. \"There was so much to do that I didn't learn at school,\" he remembers.But you don't need an MBA to launch a successful practice. Rather,careful planning is step one. \"You really need to take an introspective look at yourself and yourreal desires with your real skill sets,\"Stegall says. \"Slow down, take a look at your long-term goals and make yourfirst decision line up with where you want to be.\" Think about the kinds of patients you want to serve and where you want to live. Do you want a smallpractice, or would you like to branchout into other regions with satelliteoffices? What kinds of hours wouldyou like to work? \"Too many people look at the here and now,\" Johnson says, cautioning those who ignore the future. WWW.CHIROECO.COM JULY 14, 2011 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS \u0004.Once you have an idea of where you want to be in three to five years, you can start to develop a plan. And in thiscase, you need to be as specific as youpossibly can. Think about what you'llneed to accomplish in the first year,and how you will reach those targets.Set your sights on measurable goalswhenever you can. In short, \"Learn how to start and run a business before you open,\" saysPeter Fernandez, DC, who has helpednearly 3,000 other practitioners opennew practices. You can do this by shifting your learning focus \u2014 from chiropracticmethods and techniques to the tenetsof good business. Seminars and evenonline courses are great ways to getstarted. What's more, if you're lookingfor personalized instruction, considerhiring a consultant or coach. Thespaceforyourplace Where you decide to hang your shingle is perhaps the most important detail to consider at first. This decision will drive all others that follow \u2014 from the amount of money you'll need to how you'll frame your marketing efforts. \"It's a good idea to live and practice in the same place,\" Johnson advises.\"People want to seetheir doctor. They want to see you engaged in thecommunity.\" Settling down in a college town is a big gamble. \"That's usually the highest ratio of doctor to patients,\" Johnson explains, which ups the competition. Instead, you should be prepared tomove just about anywhere in the country. A consultant can help you find the region that is most likely to support anew practice, but don't ignore yourhometown. Having long-term relation-ships with the residents (and even lenders) can get you off to a great start. Next up is the office itself. Visibility is important here, but you shouldbalance that with the cost of rent and remodeling. Ideally, it's best to be where the action is, particularly for walk-in patients. \"You want a decent amount of traffic going by,\" Fernandez says. But just as important is what you can do with the space. \"You can havethe perfect building, but the landlord won't pay for build out,\" or customiz- \u0004\u0004 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 14, 2011 WWW.CHIROECO.COMation of the space, Johnson says. \"The build out is something that you don't want to do later, because it caninterfere with your practice.\" Fortunately, the current depressed real estate market means there's a lot ofroom for negotiating with landlords.Be careful of settling for second best,because relocating means greater costs,both in cash and patient retention,later on. Thecashconundrum Unless you have the cash on hand,you'll probably be in the market forfinancing, which is where a solidbusiness plan is vitally important. \"Most small businesses start out under-funded,\" says Bernsen. In fact,that's the number-one reason that anew practice fails, Fernandez says. Many new practitioners borrow from family members or ask them toco-sign on loans. It's critical to checkyour state's laws about partnerships,though. In many states, a non-doctorcannot own part of a medical practice. And skip high-interest financingcompanies. \"You're going to pay a lotmore money,\" Johnsonexplains. \"So, they're the last resort.\" Before you meet with a lender, you should craft a realistic business plan, including expected expenses. \"Especiallyin today's economy, you have to proveto the bank that the expenses arereasonable,\" Fernandez says. \"If a doctorasks for too little, the banker knows that. Your plan has to be realistic.\" Johnson recommends having at least 20 percent cash for a down paymenton a loan. Generally, that translates to about $20,000, which means you can expect to borrow around $80,000 toget your practice up and running. \"What a lot of chiropractors forget about is ongoing expenses,\" Stegallsays. Again, Johnson has a figure in mind: about three to four months of overhead available as a line of credit. That translates to about $30,000 to $40,000, depending on the size and location of your practice. Downtothenitty-gritty The largest expenses facing any new practitioner will include staffing, technology, and equipment \u2014 andthese decisions are often made far tooimpulsively. \"One key piece of advice is to keep your overhead low,\" Brubaker says. \"There's no reason to open a practice and have an overhead of $15,000 a month right away. That's one reason practices fail.\" In the end, having a beautiful office space and cutting-edge technology could undermine your success, especially if you can't afford all thebells and whistles. And poor staffingcan cost time and money. The expertsagree: focus on the things that willearn or save money. \"The staff can make or break you,\" says Brubaker. \"You want to find theperson who can do a lot of different things.\" At first, you may want to give the bookkeeping and front-desk roles to one person, but don't worry if you can't hire someone with years of experience. \"You can train a system, but you can't train responsibility and passion, \" Johnsonsays. \"So don't hire for experience or degrees. Hire because you are wowed bytheir personality, passion, compassion, and dedication need to be an expert,\" Fernandez says. \"You need to know where to turn.\" Findspecialists who can handle things likeaccounting, legal work, and taxes. The purchase of equipment is where you have a great deal of latitude \u2014 andunfortunately this is where many new doctors get into trouble. \"Don't get pulled into the glitz and glamour,\" Stegall says. \"You just don'tneed the fancy technical equipment.\" That advice may be hard for new chiropractors to resist after having beenintroduced to the newest technologieson the market at chiropractic school. \"Equipment is a big part of starting- up costs,\" Johnson says. \"If you can find good used equipment, it is a great option. Otherwise buying new is preferred over leasing.\" And a huge billing system is definitely not necessary at first. One of the best ways to save money is to start with a simple system. Better yet, choose something that will grow with your practice and offer you immediate,cost-saving benefits. In addition, starting out slow can offer big and unexpected advantages. \"Most patients want to see you succeed,\" Brubaker says. \"When clients see improvements, they feel invested in your practice.\" And that fosters loyalty. Spreadingtheword You have the ideal location, great financing, a staff to die for, and course that's not enough. Getting patients throughyour door is perhaps the most time-consuming and critical aspect ofstarting a new practice. \"Marketing takes an extreme amount of tenacity,\" Bernsen says. \"Because people say no, and they sayno frequently.\" Add to that the drastically changing advertising market, and marketing canseem like an insurmountable challenge. \"Six years ago, newspaper ads worked great,\" Brubaker says. \"It's adifferent world these days.\" But there's a silver lining to this change: Today, marketing yourself cancost less money. It can also, however,cost more time. \"You need to increase your exposure in your community,\" Stegall says. Thatmeans focusing on niche and guerrillamarketing. \"Put yourself in theenvironment that has the type ofpatient you want.\" In other words, make time for volunteer speaking and screenings. Tryvisiting health fairs and communityorganizations, like Kiwanis clubs. Joinyour local Chamber of Commerce.And learn how to get your messageacross quickly and effortlessly. \"I was on fire about chiropractic, \" Bernsen says about his early years as adoctor. \"But I was completely ineffectivein explaining to people why they needed my services. You need to learn how to communicate so consumers understand your product and why they need it. \" Face-to-face meetings are best, but the Internet can be a very powerfultool. It is critical for your practice tohave a website. A blog and other socialnetworking tools \u2014 like Facebook and Twitter \u2014 can also be useful. The best part is that you can learn how to use these tools for free, or atvery little cost, by searching the Webfor e-books and articles. On the whole, Johnson recommends budgeting $800 to $1,000 each monthfor marketing, but you may spendmore than that on initial costs, likesignage, website development, and print materials. There's no doubt that starting your own practice will feel like flying a plane while you're building it. Goodplanning and realistic expectationscan help lay the foundation for apractice that is designed to lastdecades. Doing the hard work now will allow you to put your degree in action \u2014 with less worry about the business side of things. CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS \u0004\u0004PRACTICECENTRAL there are MaNy WayS to SuCCeSSfully MaNage aNd Motivate your teaM ,But one of the most successful is implementing a weekly team meeting. This helpseveryone stay on the same page and understand exactly what is expectedfor the upcoming week. There's nothing like starting off the week fresh and prepared, so Mondaymorning is the best day for a weeklyteam meeting. The meeting should be held before the office opens, as this provides thebest opportunity to hold a precise andpowerful meeting. Designate a meetingarea and specific time for staffattendance. Allow your team sufficient time to perform all opening task responsibilities before settling in to the weekly meeting. Your staff will be much more attentiveduring the meeting knowing that theoffice is ready to greet patients and allmessages have been returned. During your weekly meetings, addressing the following three keypoints will keep your team focused and productive. 3keypoints 1.Staffmotivation. Begin every meeting with motivating, positive stories andanecdotes. For example: Highlight the positive execution of office procedures, and offer recognition and praise to select team members. Recognize a team member who went above and beyond their job duties, and remember to share great patient testimonials with your staff. Sometimes they don't get to hear about the marked progress a patientexperienced so it's important for themto know how chiropractic is helpingpatients. Avoid focusing too much onstatistics, and instead highlight exceptional behavior and encounters. It can be tempting to point fingers when procedures aren't being followed, but it's more effective to focus onsolutions and the importance of officeprocedures. Always point to the procedure that needs to be re-trained, notthe person who failed to implement the procedure. This dramatically lowers your team's defenses and it's easier to get back on track when you're not assigning blame. 2.Goalsetting. This is an opportunity to incorporate short-term goal setting for the upcoming week. It's a time toplan for any upcoming events thatrequire advance preparation andnotice. Achecks-and-balancesapproach Follow these three key points to effectively manage and motivate your staff.

Show your team the guidance they need to be successful.Remember to plan the action stepsrequired, assign tasks to theappropriate people, and follow throughto completion. Put action steps into place and schedule community marketing events.Plan the action that is required tomake it a measurable success, and thenbreak down the larger leaps into babysteps. Next, assign responsibilities andschedule deadlines. 3.Officetaskassignments. A weekly meeting provides an avenue for opencommunication and an opportunity todiscuss any interoffice business. Assign office tasks fairly to all staff members. Who's on vacation this weekand how will you cover for him orher? Who's taking out the trash? Whostraightens out the magazines in thelobby? Who cleans up the break room? This is a great time to hold everyone accountable, especially if someone stops doing their office tasks. Yourteam members are more likely to stick to their tasks if they know that you'llbe bringing them up at the weeklyteam meeting. When a checks-and- balances system is in place, teams tend to be more successful. Refresh everyone on closing procedures. If everyone completes the closing procedures together, everyonegets to go home on time. The weekly team meeting gives you the opportunity to get set, or re-set, for a great week. Your action step is tocompare your weekly meeting agenda to these three key points and follow the outline. This is an effective strategy to help build a cohesive team and a strongpractice. If you're not currently holding weekly meetings, start now. Let your team know that your first weekly meeting will be next Monday and it willlast approximately 15 minutes. Thatgives you time to establish this agenda and make some preliminary notes. Put your week into positive motion and keep your team focused. Everyone will be on the same page and momentum will build. You'll be moving in the right direction \u2014forward. What kind of results should you expect? A unified team focused on greater success and profits.

Of course, there arefactors such as office size, marketingbudgets, and management strategy toconsider, but these may all besecondary to the importance oflocation.

A break-evenlocation will pay the doctor a smallsalary and pay the rent but not muchmore. The go-broke location is simplynot sustainable. Indeed, the chiropractor who sets up shop in a poor location may neverget the practice off the ground. Usually,a go-broke location will not only stealyour capital but also put you intopersonal bankruptcy \u2014 after you haveexhausted your lines of credit. If you thought that site selection is all about \"location, location, location,\" you're right \u2014 intellectually. However, when chiropractic tenants are involved in the site selection process, common sense often seems to go out the window. Consider for a moment that site selection is not a science, it's an art that'spart research, part luck, and part timing. To avoid making a tragic mistake, familiarize yourself with the basics ofsite selection.

Ultimately,that doesn't benefit us.We're not helping ourselves get paid, and we're nothelping our profession justify what we're doing forcare in the eyes of theinsurance company.\" So, when it comes to documentation, what exactly is the insurance company looking for? Pagano saysinsurance companies wantto see objective measures of improvement, \"such as Oswestry questionnaires andother pain indices that demonstrate improvement in a patient's functionalcapacities.\" However, Gerbi says it's not always about knowingexactly what insurancecompanies want, but alsoknowing the differencebetween good and bad documentation. \"Good documentation always has what you're doingto the patient and whyyou're doing it,\" she says. \"You should have functionalgoals and outcome markersfor each one of the thingsyou're doing to the patient. Poor documentation is just showing that area youtreated and what you did.But no howorwhy, no time parameters, and no sense of where that visit is in terms of the bigger picture of thepatient's care.\" But that's not all. Pagano says insurance companiesneed to see that transitionfrom passive to active care. \"For insurance Documentation:Defendingtheaudit BY MELISSA HEYBOER WWW.CHIROECO.COM JULY 14, 2011 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS \u0004\u0004EDITORIALSERIESSPONSOREDBYPAYDCCHIROPRACTICSOFTWARE companies,\" Gerbi says, \"if they just see passive care for40 they're going towonder 'Why thispatient getting better?'

Don't waituntil that first audit comesbefore you change the wayyou do things. According toGerbi and Pagano, you needto start now. \"For doctors starting out, why not do it right the firsttime?

Make sure you know how to effectively hire for that position. BY DAVID FOSTER, DC More thaN liKely :three out of four froNt deSK eMPloyeeS will end up not working out within six months. This is generally because the person doing the hiring doesn't always know how to effectively advertise, interview,or choose the hire correctly. He or shemay not be able to efficiently processapplicants and choose the person withthe greatest chance of success. As you may know, a bad hire has the potential to negatively affect yourpractice. Poor patient interaction, lack of insurance knowledge, substandard secretarial skills, irresponsibility, and alack of honesty can cost you muchmore than that employee's wage. Improve your hiring skills and build a practice with stability, cohesiveness,and a culture that supports yourmission. The following ideas should increase your awareness of keyelements in the hiring process. Setexpectations. Hiring a front desk employee is like online dating. Thehiring doctor advertises what he or sheis looking for in a potential employee. This should help you to get a more accurate idea of the necessaryknowledge and abilities needed tosucceed in this position. Help-wantedadvertisement. To increase your success rate, make sure the help-wanted advertisement states exactlywhat you are looking for and clarifiesthe expectations of the position. The goal of the ad is to attract the person that fits your requirements and weed out the ones who don't. Think ofthis as the beginning of the courtship, where you'll figure out if both party's expectations are similar. Where you advertise should be congruent to the position you arefilling. The most efficient vehicle for advertising is the Internet. In this day and age, the person searching for employment in anewspaper may not be the person for your position. For the front deskposition, you can advertise through online employment websites or your local town's website. R\u00e9sum\u00e9review. The most important question to ask yourself whenreviewing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is, \"Does thisapplicant fit the needs of the position?\" Take all personal attributes out of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 review process. Comparethe r\u00e9sum\u00e9 against your wish list andmake a cut-and-dried decision. Youshould not be swayed by anything butthe facts presented on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Next, separate the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s into two piles: the ones you want to interviewand the ones you don't. Interviewprocess. The first interview should be by phone. Set aside a time\u2014 preferably in the evening \u2014 andspeak with each applicant for five to 10minutes.Ask open-ended questions that will help you evaluate the applicant. Put your effort into listening to the applicant's answers and ask yourself if you' d want this person answering your phone. The second, third, and possibly forth interviews should pare down the field by matching the applicants toyour original wish list. The questionsyou ask should start out basic and gradually become more specific to the job responsibilities. Once you have chosen a few candidates, consider giving a series of aptitude and personality tests to help confirm your decision. You can find various tests on the Internet that willchallenge the applicants' technical and emotional talents. Makingthedecision. As the pool of applicants is reduced, each person's background should be thoroughlyresearched. Once you have gone through all the steps to choosing a new hire, you should feel confident that you utilized a logical and structured process that will afford you the best chance of success. DAVID 2011 WWW.CHIROECO.COMPRACTICECENTRAL MasteringtheE/Mguidelines The medical decision making component ties it all together. BY KATHY MILLS CHANG, MCS-P WelCoMe to Part three of thiS foCuS SerieS on the evaluation and management (E/M) guidelines. This will wrap up what you need to knowto stay compliant with E/M coding forthe Centers for Medicare and MedicaidServices (CMS). In the last installment, the elements of your patient's examination were reviewed and you learned how it is thesecond of the three key elements of the patient's E/M service. Now, the third part of this E/M documentationseries will unravel the final component of the E/M code: medical decisionmaking (MDM). For chiropractors,this is 1. Patient history2. Examination3. MDM Remember that your patient's medical record should establish achronological record of exams, testsand results, and treatments andtreatment plans (including thediagnosis and prognosis of the illnessor disease). The medical record shouldcorroborate the reimbursement requestand is requisitioned by most payers foradjudication of claims whenreimbursement is in question. Your medical recordkeeping is a vital piece in the puzzle ofreimbursement. Therefore, a clearunderstanding of all requirements,including those of MDM is critical. MDM is fraught with controversy and confusion, and it is the mostdifficult of the three components ofE/M coding.ThreesubcomponentsofMDM thatmustbeconsidered: 1. The number of diagnoses and/or management options that must be documented in the patient record. 2. The amount of data that is to be reviewed. 3. The risk of complications, morbidity, and/or mortality. MDM should reflect your cognitive work, clinical skill, and judgment in rating the complexity of the decision-making process as well as the complexity of the diagnosis and therapeutic options. More than the other parts of E/M (thehistory and exam), it will likely be theMDM component that determines thelevel of E/M service you are able to bill,especially for a new patient. Because MDM can be conceptually challenging, there are some doctorswho simply guess at the medicaldecision-making levels (it certainlydoesn't help that the MDM guidelinesleave much unstated and not clearlyunderstood). According to the Officeof Inspector General (OIG) and CMS, chiropractors seem to consistently lag behind other professions when itcomes to proper coding and documentation. Moreover, there are numerous doctors who consistently under-codetheir levels of E/M service, mistakenly believing that this allows them to fly under the radar of auditors. It is important to know that under-coding is as bad as over-coding claims, and is indirect violation of the False Claims Act (when done purposely). In addition, there are fines and penalties that can be imposed on any person who knowinglysubmits a false claim for payment. As a general rule, each increase of one E/M level (e.g., increasing from 99201 to 99202) increases the usual and customary fee for the code by about 50 percent. Some doctors think of their medical decision making as \"routine\"and select a straightforward MDM. If you are meeting the documen- \u0004\u0004 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 14, 2011 WWW.CHIROECO.COMPRACTICE CENTRAL tation requirements for billing higher level E/M codes, and are doing thework, you have every right to be paidfor it. But your documentation mustreflect the correct elements of MDM tojustify the code. On the flip side, doctors tend to believe they can justify a higher levelMDM code because the patient theyare seeing is in severe pain orexperiencing many symptoms. Thisisn't necessarily how it works. Take a look at the following two patients (and unfortunately commonexamples) to make a simpledetermination. Example one: An older woman presents to you for the first time,experiencing severe pain in her neckand right shoulder. She is currentlybeing treated with another physician forbreast cancer and is on chemotherapy.She has been unable to turn her head tothe right more than 15 degrees. She hasno previous history of this condition. Example two: An older man reports to you for the first time, experiencingdiscomfort in his lower back and legs.He is currently under treatment withhis family physician for COPD,hypertension, hypertrophic arthritis,and diabetes. His forward flexion isrestricted, and all his movements areslow and guarded. He has no previoushistory of this condition. Based on these two patients who both suffer from underlying condi-tions, which one do you think mightqualify for a higher level of MDM?Even though our first patient issuffering from a disease that may beterminal, it does not necessarily qualifyfor billing a higher level of E/M basedon decision making. Actually, our second patient has numerous health problems and therewould likely be much more data to bereviewed. For this reason, it would inall probability be the second case thatwould warrant a higher level of MDM. Both the 1995 and 1997 E/M guidelines are the same for MDM.MDM is based on the complexity ofthe decision in making an accuratediagnosis and in establishing a treatment plan for the patient. The complexity of that decision is broken down and divided into three subcomponents: 1.Thenumberofdiagnosesor managementoptions: These can be minimal, limited, multiple, orextensive. They are scored according towhether the problem is self limited,established, or new, and whether the condition is stable, improved, orworsening. These can also be affected if you plan any additional work up.You must document in the patient record the number of diagnoses and management options based on thenumber of conditions or problems youare addressing during the encounter. 2.Theamountofdatatobereviewed. This can be none, minimal, limited,moderate, or extensive. It can includeany labs ordered or reviewed, X-raysordered or reviewed, medical proce-dures ordered or reviewed, discussionof test results with the performing physician, a decision to obtain oldrecords, and independent visualization of images, tracings, or specimens. 3.Theriskofcomplicationordeathifthe conditionshouldgountreated. Risk can be minimal, low, moderate, or high. This can include reviewing problemsfrom minor to chronic, acute anduncomplicated, to new problems andexacerbations that range from minorto severe. According to the documentation guidelines outlined in the current proce-dural terminology (CPT), there are fourlevels of MDM that are recognized: 1. Straightforward decision making: Minimal diagnosis and treatment.There is minimal or no complexity ofdata to be reviewed and minimal riskto the patient. 2. Low-complexity decision making:Limited number of diagnosis and management options, limited data tobe reviewed, and low risk of complications. 3. Moderate-complexity decision making: Multiple diagnosis and management options, moderate amount and complexity of data to review, and amoderate risk to the patient of compli- cations or death if left untreated. 4. High-complexity decision making: Extensive number of diagnosis and management options, extensive amountand complexity of data to be reviewed, and a high risk to the patient ofcomplications or death if left untreated. Because the clinical examples on the MDM score sheets reference medicine(i.e., biopsies, drugs, and IVs), it cansometimes be more difficult to quantify risk based on those examples since they don't apply to chiropracticcare and treatment. Regardless, you must utilize the industry standard of MDM, as it would be those same scoresheets and point systems an auditorwould use to evaluate your MDM and level of E/M service billed. Now that all three key components of E/M coding have been covered, you have all the tools necessary to properly code evaluation and managementservices for your patients. By using appropriate judgment and clinical recordkeeping, you can display the corporate integrity that proclaims your desire to curb fraud, abuse, and waste, and set a great example for your colleagues that sets you apart from the pack.

BY MONICA WOFFORD, CSP CoNSider thiS tyPiCal MaNageMeNt SCeNario !You have a star employee at the front desk. She outperforms her coworkers, gets your filing system humming,completes your documentationobjectives, and so it seems fitting torecognize and celebrate heraccomplishments. Some doctors might opt to throw a surprise party, complete with balloonsand a cake. But instead of delightedastonishment, your employee mightvery well burst into tears and beterribly embarrassed. Worse, you mightdiscover that your former rock starnow seems reserved and less motivatedthan before. What happened? The answer is simple: You gave her the wrong kind of recognition. Yes, you wanted to throw a party for an amazing team member in your office,but did you consider what shemay have wanted in the way of recognition, or did you give her the kind of praise that you like to receive? Recognition is apowerful tool \u2014 particularly if youdeliver it the wrong way. The first step to avoiding this kind of mistake is to understand the different types of recognition. Armed with this knowledge, you can better discern who will respond best to which particular style, and you'll energize your office dynamos instead of quashing them. Thefourstylesofrecognition Although it is the most popular, publicrecognition is notthe only kind of praise available. In fact, it will diminishthe efforts of a private person. Thefour key types of recognition are: /trianglertPublic /trianglertPrivate /trianglertTangible /trianglertIntangible Most often, employees will be some combination of two of the four types(e.g., public-tangible, private-intangible,etc.). The public types prefer a party or event made in their honor, and theymay even ask you \"Where is theparty?\" if you keep their praise private. The private types want quiet words or a simple \"thank you,\" and they shrink faster than ice on a hot day if you embarrass them publicly. The tangible types want trophies, certificates, and tchotchkes galore. The intangible types will be fine with a high-five or gift card. Also, keep in mind that money is an intangible reward once it's spent. Are you giving your employees what they'd prefer or what you'd like for yourself instead? 1.Findoutwhattheywant. If you've ever bought a gift for someone simplybecause you thought it was cute, thenyou've been guilty of giving what you want. It's a commonplace fault, but inthe workplace it can backfire. If youhave every plaque, certificate, andribbon you've ever won displayed onyour wall, then you are a public-tangible person. Others you work withmay not be. Look at what others give and how they reward one another. It's a suresign of what they would like to havefor themselves. Those who bringcookies as gifts usually want something tangible in return. Those who high-five everyone in the office tend to be intangibles, and those who are more personal and private in their praise are likely just that \u2014 private. If you're going to provide praise, why not deliver it in the way that ismost effective? Determine what youremployees need and adjust your strategy accordingly. 2.Payattentiontofrequency. Now that you know the need to adjust yourstrategy to match the four types of people, it may seem as if you have toprovide unequal treatment \u2014 not so. Continue to be equitable, and giveeach person equal amounts of praisefor equal achievements. \"Equal\" doesn't mean \"same.\" Also, monitor your frequency. Praise provided every week on a schedule will become rote andlose its motivational value. Praise is powerful, and it is needed in amounts both large and small to those who perform above and beyond your expectations. If they meet a goal, thank them. If they exceed a goal twice-fold, give them large amounts of praise. As a leader, you train others, and positive reinforcement goes a longer way thannegative consequences. Of course, it'simportant to have both, but praise is always more fun to dole out.

When there is anational energy crisis, you cut downon the use of appliances and utilities.And if you personally have low energyand fatigue, it affects your physical,mental, and spiritual well-being. In a similar way, there might be an energy crisis happening in your practice. Wherever there are \"energy leaks\" taking place, the chances of an energy crisis are greater. Thelittlethingsmatter It can start with something as simpleas how your front desk staff isanswering the telephone. Is this personon fire for chiropractic, enthusiasticabout you and the practice? Your frontdesk staff should be as committed tothe practice as the doctor. When patients arrive, are they greeted by name? Is there musicplaying in the office that projectsexcitement? Your sound system canadd motivation as people move throughout the office. The positive or negative energy that flows between you, your staff, and your patients is a major part of theatmosphere that either creates rain orsunshine in the office. Your office needs duty and job descriptions for everyone employed;do you have these items in place?Delegation and teamwork areimportant components to keepinghigh energy levels and momentum. Theblamegame Micromanagement is no substitute for properly training your staff. Everyone should be confident and skilled in their responsibilities. Your use of praise and reprimand helps guide your staff toward a commitment to the larger vision. Doctors who place blame on team members and micromanage them actually drain energy outof the practice.When reprimanding staff, it is important to address the procedure or system involved, not the person.Most often, the problem will be moreof a training issue than a matter ofdirect fault. High morale and high energy create a monster practice, with more patientsand more fun. Remember that motionis a key to high energy offices \u2014 thehigher the energy, the bigger the practice. Helping and healing more people should be the ultimate valuethat your practice expresses. Your enthusiasm in asking for referrals internally and externally is a factor in how your energy influences others to make an appointment with you. \"Energy,\" in this sense, is theconfidence, knowledge, and dedication to the values and vision that you have set for yourself.

When you have systems in place for day one and day two procedures, there is better understanding by both patient and presenter, and there should be no stressful issues foreither party. During day one and day two procedures, you want to establish a relationship and rapport with the patient, building confidence. As aresult, the patient should have noquestions about your intentions or integrity. Your office should present itself as the pinnacle of health and wellness, a well-oiled, system-based machine thatcan process and care for the peoplewho need chiropractic care in yourcommunity.

Massage therapy is a therapeutic procedure onone or more areas, each for15 minutes. Massage therapycould be used as a prepara-tory procedure on the sameday as a therapeutic pro-cedure to restore musclefunction, decrease stiffness,reduce edema, improve jointmotion, or for relief ofmuscle spasms. It should be related to other therapeutic procedureswithin the overall plan oftreatment. CPT code 97140, on the other hand, is for manualtherapy techniques. Manualtherapy techniques includesoft tissue and joint mobiliza-tion, manipulation, manuallymphatic drainage, manualtraction, trigger point therapy(non-injectable), andmyofascial release. Manual therapy techniques are used to treatrestricted motion of softtissues in the extremities,neck, and trunk. These areused in an active and/orpassive fashion to help effectchanges in the soft tissues,articular structures, andneural or vascular systems. For example: Facilitation of fluid exchange, restoration ofmovement in acutelyedematous muscles, orstretching of shortenedconnective tissue. Manual therapy is used when a loss of motor abilityimpedes function. Manualtherapy is also considered atherapeutic procedure, onone or more areas and eachfor 15 minutes. Another difference between 97124 and 97140 isthe intention of the therapy.If you are performing thera-peutic massage in order toincrease circulation andpromote tissue relaxation tothe muscles, and the treat- ment is based on or consists of a basic relaxation massage, you should use 97124. If, however, your intention is to increase pain-free range of motion andfacilitate a return tofunctional activities, youshould use 97140. The documentation for both services should showobjective loss of joint motion,strength, or mobility, andmust be part of an activetreatment plan directed at aspecific outcome. Importantnotice: The National Correct CodingInitiative (NCCI) edits created by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) require that manual therapy techniques be performed in a separate anatomic site than the chiropractic adjustments in order to be reimbursed. Therefore, if you do this, attach the 59 modifier to 97140 in order to indicate that it is a distinct procedureand is being performed at a different anatomic region than the chiropracticadjustments. Documentationoftherapeutic procedures: Modalities orultrasound) are generallycoded and billed based onthe device that is used. Therapeutic procedures are generally coded and billed on the basis of the intended outcome, not on adevice or piece of equipment. When billing and coding for therapeutic procedures,document the intended clinical outcome, as well ashow the procedure is performed. The relationship to a functional activity is important to document inthe treatment plan. For example: Increase flexibility of the quadratus lumborum muscles, while activating and stretching thehamstring muscles, to understanding the differences between CPT codes 97124 and 97140.

BY BOB LEVOY iNaBad eCoNoMy :it'S teMPtiNg to loWer feeS :if not across the board, then at least selectively for comparison-shopped, price-sensitiveservices. Known as \"market-driven pricing,\" this strategycan make your morecompetitive with practicesthat have lower fees and helpretain price-consciouspatients who mightotherwise leave your care. Realitycheck: Low fees are thought by somechiropractors to be asignificant competitiveadvantage in attracting newpatients. And for the shortterm, they can be. The long-term reality, however, is thatregardless of how low yourfees are, someone willalways be willing toundercut your pricing. Anotherconsideration: To maintain your current income (with discounted fees), you and your staff will obviously need to see more patients (or drastically reduce your overhead). If youchoose the first option, you'll need to work faster and put in longer hours. Some chiropractors thrive on such pressure. For others, it's a formula for burnout. Anentirelydifferentoption: Upgrade the level of careand service you and yourstaff provide \u2014 and raise fees. The benefits of thisstrategy include greaterpatient (and personal)satisfaction, increasedreferrals, higher income, andless stress. Will patients leave? Most chiropractors report little ifany change in patientvolume following a feeincrease (especially if thereare improvements in thelevel of care and service).And more than a fewreport they're actuallybusier than before. One of the reasons for this apparent paradox is thatpatients (like all consumers)tend to relate quality to cost.\"If you pay more, it'sprobably worth more\" goesthe theory. Obviously, this isonly a hypothesis, but onethat is generally borne outin practice. For better or worse, some chiropractors'reputations are based largelyon their fees. Before deciding which direction you want to gowith your fees (higher,lower, or no change),consider the followingquestions: /trianglertDo have want and needfrom your practice? Is itquality care, specialized and personalized services, and extended hours? Or is it predominantly no-frills service and low fees? \"price sensitive\" areyour services? They probably are if yourpractice gets frequent complaints about fees ortelephone inquiries about the cost of office visits. Conversely, they're less likely to be price sensitive if your services are highly differentiated (i.e., unique in your community), andif they are covered partly or in full by insurance. /trianglertDo you know the level of quality, service, and fees of your competing practices? /trianglertIf you were to increase your fees, does your practice \"look the part\"? Are your exam rooms,equipment, office d\u00e9cor, and building exterior in keeping with an above-average fee structure? /trianglertIs your staff trained and ready to provide above-average care and personalized service? /trianglertDo you know youroverhead costs? /trianglertDo you know whatincrease in patient volume is needed to offset the loss of income when fees arediscounted by varying amounts? /trianglertAre you aware of theleverage that fees have on profitability? For example: Consider a practice with $400,000 in revenue and $240,000 in expenses. The resulting profit is $160,000. If fees are increased by 20 percent while costs are kept thesame, revenue will increase from $400,000 to $480,000(assuming the same number of patients). The profit inthis case will increase from $160,000 to $240,000 \u2014 a50-percent increase. Conversely, a fee decrease of 20 percent will result in adrop in revenue from$400,000 to $320,000 (again assuming the same number of patients) along with adecrease in profit from$160,000 to $80,000 \u2014 a 50- percent decrease. To makeback this $80,000 (let alone exceed it) would necessitate a huge influx of new patients. These are some of the key issues to consider prior to raising or lowering yourfees.

BY BRIAN O'NEILL over the PaSt deCade :the field of ChiroPraCtiC aNd CoMPleMeNtary MediCiNe has advanced tremendously, from practitioners learning new techniquesof care to the continued emergence ofquantifiable evidence to support itsfindings. As a result, the entirediscipline has grown in acceptance,popularity, and respect. Over the same period, something else has evolved as well \u2014 the toolsyou can use to make your practicerun smoother, more efficiently, andmore profitably. Nowhere is this more evident than when it comes to the new back-officetechnologies that support practices ofall sizes. Although some software solutions were once only affordable and practicalfor large offices, today thesetechnologies make sense even forpractices with few staff and modestbudgets. As a result, now most doctorscan benefit from powerful technologyif they plan and choose wisely. Still, though, too many chiropractors are continuing to run the back end oftheir practice \"old school,\" performingtasks manually on paper when theycould be more efficient and costeffective by upgrading to a comput-erized approach. Consider thefollowing examples.Submittingclaimselectronically: It's an electronic world, and if you want to getpaid quickly and correctly, you need to submit claims electronically. You canenhance your practice with a clearing-house and practice managementsystem that encompasses scheduling,billing, and accounts receivable. Your system should allow you to easily and accurately enter your diagnosis and treatment. It can then produce a claim and send it to a clearinghouse that will flag any mistakes and then pass it on to theappropriate payer. Handling your billing this way greatly reduces time and expenses(paper, stamps, etc.), as well as thetime it takes for you to get paid.Remember that insurance companieslove providers who work electronicallybecause they, like you, are saving timeand money by adapting to these newnorms. Eligibilitychecking: You already know that it's critical to ensure that yourpatients have insurance, and that theyunderstand what part of their bill theyare responsible for. Advanced eligibilitychecking technology makes this easy. The right program can authenticate insurance, and confirm how many visits a patient has remaining, before the patient even walks into your office. It isa lot easier for you to collect a direct payment before the patient leaves youroffice than it is to bill the insurance company later and then need to follow up. And remember, this is important even if you've seen the patient before, because you need to know how manyvisits he or she has remaining for insurance reimbursement. Electronicremittanceadvice: Another technology that can save you time isthe electronic remittance advice (ERA),also referred to as explanation ofbenefits (EOB). With some softwarepackages, you can view the ERAelectronically, but have to postmanually. With the right kind of software, you can integrate ERA with a clearinghouse for automatic posting. This reduction in paper for both you and the payer typically lets you know what you're going to be paid lessthan a week after you have submitted your claim. It's even better if the payercan also send payment by electronic funds transfer (EFT) directly into yourbank account. Electronichealthrecords: The U.S. government is encouraging a movement toward electronic healthrecords (EHR) as a way to fosterimprovements in healthcare quality, safety, efficiency, and access. HavingMONEYMANAGEMENT\u0004\u0004 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 14, 2011 WWW.CHIROECO.COMMONEY MANAGEMENT the right EHR system in place benefits both you and your patients. In fact, part of the economic stimulus package passed by Congressin 2009 provides incentive paymentsfor Medicare providers who adopt anduse \"certified\" EHR systems beginningthis year. If you see Medicare patients,you could be eligible for stimulusmoney \u2014 as much as $18,000 in thefirst year alone, and up to as much as$44,000 over five years. Patientportal: All chiropractors should establish an online portal (i.e., awebsite) through which they cancommunicate directly with theirpatients. A modern website will allowyour patients to schedule and changetheir appointments online \u2014 which isgood for an independent practice witha small staff. The more you can doelectronically, the more time you haveto spend with patients and focus onwhat attracted you to the profession inthe first place. Many of these services, such as the clearinghouse, practice management system, and patient portal, are available to you at no cost. All you need isInternet access and, ideally, a Web- based solution that allows you to access it from wherever you are: athome, in the office, or on the road. You'll also want the right partner to get you up and running and support your needs on an ongoing basis. Inmaking that choice, look for acompany that provides everything you need under one umbrella. It's important that all the electronic components of your office are compat- ible. A full-service firm will give you one point of administrative contact and provide maximum cost savings for you and your practice. The right company will not only get you up and running today, but keep you current astechnology continues to advance. It is likely that you are already doing many of the things discussed. The question is whether you are doing them manually or electronically. Ask yourself:Which approach makes the most sense in terms of time and money? Which approach will best serve my patients?Which approach allows me to focusmore time on my patients? Just as you turn to quantifiable evidence to improve the clinical care you deliver, maybe it's time to rethink your back office and rely on emerging best practices there as well. BRIAN 2011 WWW.CHIROECO.COMaNoN -CoMPete agreeMeNt iS arguaBly the MoSt CoNtroverSial part of any contract. It's difficult to set a general rule, and the courts won't enforce theagreement unless it's \"reasonable.\" First, consider the general terms of a non-compete agreement. This part ofan employment contract is designed toprotect the hiring doctor in case youdecide to leave and try to take his orher patients with you. Non-competeagreementsusuallytake theformofarestrictiononthreefactors: 1. Scope of activity (practicing chiropractic versus practicing a specifictechnique), 2. Range of activity (prohibiting practice within a certain radius fromthe hiring doctor's practice), and 3. Period of restrictions. What'sreasonable? Here's where it gets tricky. What is a \"reasonable\" restriction? Most agreements broadly restrict \"practice of chiropractic.\" In regard to a time period, in most cases, two years or less are considered a \"reasonable\" time to prohibit you from practicing within the region of the hiring doctor's practice. The distance restriction is more problematic, as it depends on the areain question. In an area that has a lot ofpeople, such as a suburb, the area ofrestriction might be no more than fivemiles. In a rural area, the restrictionmight be as much as 25 miles.Non-compete agreements are based on the concept of \"restraint of trade.\" Ifthe non-compete agreement unrea- sonably restricts the former employee's ability to practice, its provisions are not going to be upheld. If the former employee merely engages in \"ordinarycompetition,\" i.e., the same level of competition as any other chiropractorsetting up practice in the area,prohibiting the former employee frompracticing is unreasonable. On the other hand, if the former employee takes patient files and solicits former patients, that's unfair to the former employer and goes beyond\"ordinary competition.\" So how do you know what's reasonable? That's the problem \u2014 it's a vague criterion. For example: Imagine you have signed a non-compete agreement that forbids you from practicing chiropractic for two years within 25miles of the other doctor, and you arein Golden, Colo. Technically, if youdecide to set up practice in Boulder (alittle more than 20 miles away), youwould be in violation of the contract. In a worst-case scenario, this could wind up being decided in court. If theother doctor sees that you did this, hecan get a court to issue an injunctionagainst you, prohibiting you frompracticing in that location until thecase is settled. This might take months, if not years to resolve. The case would eventuallygo to court, and the judge or jurywould decide whether to uphold the non-compete based on whether theythink it unreasonably prohibits you from practicing. Even if you \"win\" a case like this, you ultimately lose, because you've been shutdown; you have attorney's fees to pay;and you have to rebuild your practice. You may have heard that non- compete agreements are illegal. That'snot true; they are just difficult to enforce. Courts decide on a case-by-case basis, and the burden of proof is on the former hiring doctor to prove that the non-compete is not unreasonable. The best course of action is to go into an associate contract knowing thatyou'll have to move well away from this practice when you leave. If the non-compete agreement specifies 25 miles, double the distance to at least 50 miles when setting up your ownpractice. Play it safe.
