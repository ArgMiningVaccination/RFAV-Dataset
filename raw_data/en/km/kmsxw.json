There are four main types of NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (like chronic obstructed pulmonary disease and asthma) and type-2 diabetes. It is estimated that NCDs cause the greatest global share of death and disability, accounting for around 38 million deaths each year worldwide. Of them, 28 millions deaths occur in low or middle income countries. WHO estimates that total deaths from non-communicable diseases will increase by a further 70% over the next 10 years. In India, NCDs are a big health problem being responsible for sizeable mortality and morbidity. According to WHO estimation, NCDs accounted for 5.9 million deaths (60% of total deaths) in the country in 2012. The probability of dying prematurely (between the ages 30 and 70 years) due to the four main types of NCDs is 26%. The key risk factors for NCDs in India are tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and use of alcohol. Rapid urbanization, globalization, environmental factors and aging population are some other factors that fuel the occurrence of NCDs. To supplement the efforts initiated by State governments for prevention and control of NCDs, the Government of India launched National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) by providing technical and financial support. The NPCDCS launched in 2010 aims to prevent and control common NCDs through behaviour and lifestyle changes; provide early diagnosis and management of common NCDs; build capacity at various levels of health care for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of common NCDs; train human resource within the public health setup viz doctors, paramedics and nursing staff to cope with the increasing burden of NCDs; and establish and develop capacity for palliative and rehabilitative care. Recently the Government of India took initiative to exploit potentials of Indian traditional systems of medicine engaging Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) in the implementation of NPCDCS and integrating their unique and time-tested therapies and principles in achieving the objectives of the programme. The Unani System of Medicine, being a holistic system to address all determinants of health and disease, can play a pivotal role in prevention and management of NCDs and promotion of healthy lifestyle among masses. The Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM), an autonomous research organisation of Ministry of AYUSH, has been allocated Lakhimpur Kheri District of Uttar Pradesh to supplement NPCDCS conducted by Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India. The CCRUM intends to extend its services and resources to the programme through its Central Research Institute of Unani Medicine, Lucknow at 17 Community Health Centres (CHCs), 54 Primary Health Centres (PHCs), District Hospital and NPCDCS Cell at district headquarters. This training manual has been prepared to train the human resources engaged in the implementation of the programme, sensitize them with its objectives and make them aware about their roles and responsibilities. New Delhi (Prof. Rais-ur-Rahman) March 3, 2016 Director General, CCRUM Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 9INTRODUCTION The Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) to provide technical and financial support for the prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The activities at State, District, CHC and Sub Centre levels have been planned under the programme and will be closely monitored through NCD Cells at different levels. The NCD Cells will ensure implementation and supervision of the programme activities related to health promotion, early diagnosis, treatment and referral, and further facilitate partnership with laboratories for early diagnosis of NCDs. Recently, Rheumatic Heart Disease has also been added in the programme. What are NCDs? Non-communicable diseases (NCD) are non-infectious diseases, which last for long periods of time and progress slowly. The four main groups of non-communicable diseases are cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructed pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes. These diseases by and large can be prevented by making simple lifestyle changes. Burden of NCDs \u00b7 Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) kill 38 million people each year. \u00b7 Almost three quarters of NCD deaths - 28 million - occur in low- and middle-income countries. \u00b7 Sixteen million NCD deaths occur before the age of 70; 82% of these \"premature\" deaths occurres in low- and middle-income countries. \u00b7 Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths i.e. 17.5 million people annually, followed by cancers (8.2 million), respiratory diseases (4 million), and diabetes (1.5 million). \u00b7 These four groups of diseases account for 82% of all NCD deaths. \u00b7 Overall prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, Ischemic Heart Diseases (IHD) and Stroke is 62.47, 159.46, 37.00 and 1.54 respectively per 1000 population of India. Who is at Risk? NCDs can affect all age groups, but usually associated with older age groups and all are vulnerable to the risk factors that contribute to non-communicable diseases, whether from unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, exposure to tobacco smoke or the effects of the use of alcohol. These diseases are driven by factors that include ageing, rapid unplanned urbanization, and the globalization of unhealthy lifestyles. For example, globalization of unhealthy lifestyles like unhealthy diets may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, increased blood glucose, elevated blood lipids and obesity. These are called 'intermediate risk factors' which can lead to cardiovascular diseases. Risk Factors 1. Tobacco use - Tobacco accounts for around 6 million deaths every year (including from the effects of exposure to passive smoking) and is projected to increase to 8 million by 2030.Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 102. Physical inactivity/sedentary lifestyle- About 3.2 million deaths annually can be attributed to insufficient physical activity. 3. Unhealthy diet - 1.7 million annual deaths from cardiovascular causes have been attributed to excess salt/sodium intake in 2010. 4. Alcohol consumption - More than half of the 3.3 million annual deaths from drinking are from NCDs. These factors lead to four key metabolic/physiological changes that increase the risk of NCDs: raised blood pressure, overweight/obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Conventional system of medicine offers solution for such problems, but long-term use of conventional drugs may produce adverse effects. Unani System of Medicine has established specified treatments for various chronic and lifestyle disorders. Use of plants and plant products in the form of crude drugs as well as in various compound formulations for combating NCDs has been a major strength of Unani System of Medicine. UNANI SySTEM OF MEDICINE The Unani System of Medicine is one of the oldest systems of medicine that aims at preservation of health, management of diseases and restoration of healthy lifestyle. It provides preventive, promotive, curative and rehabilitative healthcare with holistic approach. The fundamental framework of this system is based on scientific principles including Hippocratic theory of four Akhlat (Humours) - Dam (Blood), Balgham (Phlegm), Safra (Yellow Bile) and Sawda (Black Bile). Admixture of different elements and their qualities in specific ratio in a particular entity, whether living or non-living, denominates its Mizaj (Temperament). Human temperament is denoted which can be correlated with the temperament of diet, drugs, environmental factors. Unani Medicine also believes that Tabiat Mudabbira-e Badan (Medicatrix Naturae) is the supreme power, which controls all the physiological functions of the body, provides resistance against the diseases and helps in healing naturally. Unani System of Medicine believes that every individual has its own unique temperament according to their humoral constitution, lifestyle and environment. Any deviation from its normal temperament results into disease. The management of the disease depends upon the correction of altered temperament by using various regimens, diet and drugs. It makes use of certain special modes and regimens of diet, physical movements, lifestyle and techniques such as Hijamat (Cupping), Taliq (Leeching), Fasd the body (Tanqiya). The Unani System of Medicine is holistic in nature. It takes entire constitution of the individual and lifestyle into account for diagnosing and prescribing the treatment. Physicians select the drugs and regimens according to the temperament of the patient and nature of the disease. The thrust area of Unani System of Medicine is the management of chronic and lifestyle diseases. It provides radical and safe cure for various chronic disorders, such as psychoneurotic disorders, hepato-biliary disorders, gastro-intestinal disorders, metabolic disorders. Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 11Apart from treating disease conditions, Unani System of Medicine lays great emphasis on the prevention of disease and promotion of existing health through principles of six pre-requisites or essential factors of life i.e. Asbab-e-Sitta Zarooriya. All the factors affecting health and disease, of whom those affecting all human beings perpetually are called Zarooriya (Essential), while, the rest are called Ghayr Zarooriya (Non-Essential). It should be noted that the following 'Six Essential Factors' are used not only for maintaining health and preventing diseases, but also for treating diseases. (1) Hawa (Air) Air is the most crucial factor for life. It helps in the production and maintenance of Rooh (Pneuma), which is the source of vitality. Unani System of Medicine uses air in prevention and treatment chiefly by taking into account the seasonal variations in air. For instance, in summer, air becomes hotter, so cold food and moderate movement and exercise should be adopted to remain healthy and vice versa. (2) Makool o Mashroob (Food and Drinks) Food and drinks are second only to air in maintaining life and health by replacing the body's used-up and broken-down components (Badal ma Yatahallal). Keeping in view the importance of food, Unani System of Medicine makes extensive use of diet both for promotion of health and treatment of disease. A healthy man should use mainly the food of the temperament similar to his own temperament. However, if he is threatened with a pathological shift in his temperament, he should use food of the opposite temperament. Unani System of Medicine also provides extensive guidelines for the type of water and the appropriate time for drinking it. For instance, in order to ensure proper digestion, people of hot temperament should drink water during meals, but cold temperament persons should use water only after the digestion has fully set in. (3) Harakat o Sukoon Badani (Bodily Movement and Repose) The Unani System of Medicine gives great importance to both appropriate movement and rest for maintaining health and for curing disease. Movement is necessary for evacuating waste products and rest is needed for retaining nutrients till the completion of digestion. The system offers a wide concept of exercise of all organs. It classifies movement into two types: high frequency and intensity with short duration, which increases heat; and low frequency and intensity with long duration, which increases metabolism. (4) Harakat o Sukoon Nafsani (Psychic Movement and Repose) The Unani System of Medicine fully recognizes the role of psychic states in maintaining health and treating disease. Unani Medicine describes mental states basically in terms of the movement and repose of pneuma. Its movement increases heat while repose increases cold. So, excessive movement or repose of pneuma causes hot and cold pathologies. These pathologies can be managed both by altering the mental states and by administering cold or hot drugs. (5) Nawm o yaqza (Sleep and Wakefulness) Sleep is necessary for preserving pneuma and vitality and providing replacement of wear and tear (Badal ma Yatahallal), while wakefulness is necessary for voluntary functions. Excess of sleep increases coldness Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 12and wetness, while excess of wakefulness increases hotness and dryness. Therefore, moderation should be exercised with regard to them. Just as wakefulness helps voluntary functions, particularly intellectual functions, sleep helps digestion. So, the digestion of hot food is more dependent on sleep. (6) Ihtibas o Istifragh (Retention and Evacuation) Retention of nutrients is needed not only for full digestion and metabolism but also to maintain reserves of nutrients and essential substances. Evacuation is needed for removal of waste products which may cause obstructions or embolism and toxicity. Evacuation takes place by defecation, micturition, coitus, sweating etc. Unani System of Medicine and NCDs The Unani System of Medicine has more realistic view of disease because it considers several factors that contribute to the origin of most diseases and puts great emphasis on lifestyle management for promotion of health, prevention and treatment of NCDs. It considers diet, lifestyle, emotions, interaction with the environment, and even spiritual factors. Therefore, it is of immense relevance to present times as lifestyle diseases like Hypertension, Diabetes, Obesity, Depression are imposing the greatest burden on healthcare. The Unani System of Medicine integrates both external environment like seasons, air purity, food and drinks, as well as internal environment i.e. movement and rest, sleep and wakefulness, evacuation and retention etc. It has correlated all these factors with each other and with human beings by discovering their Mizaj (temperament). Thus, it can individualize the appropriate quality and quantity of diet, bodily movements, mental activity, etc. for each individual and period of life i.e. childhood, old age, gender, season, etc. Unani System of Medicine provides multi-factorial guidelines to successfully maintain health by using same temperament factors in health and opposite temperament factors in disease. In diseases like T uberculosis, AIDS, Cancer, etc. where the long-term therapy is required, a number of Unani drugs e.g. Khamira Marwarid, Dawa al-Kurkum, Habb-i Jawahar can be used as an adjuvant. They play an important role in reducing the toxicity of the synthetic drugs and in modulating or enhancing the body immunity and improving the overall quality of life. Unani System of Medicine provides very comprehensive, specified and individualized guidance for this purpose. Both promotion of health and treatment of disease can be done to a great extent by non-drug factors, which are safer, cheaper and more easily employed than drugs. On account of its ability to undertake health promotion and disease prevention by non-drug lifestyle factors, the Unani System of Medicine is of great relevance to present-day healthcare, as lifestyle related diseases like Hypertension, Diabetes, Depression make up great burden for healthcare in these days. INTEGRATION OF UNANI SySTEM OF MEDICINE IN NPCDCS With a view to supplement health preservation, promotion, prevention and management of lifestyle diseases, Unani System of Medicine aims to integrate with the NPCDCS.

It is usually characterized by a new lump, unexplained anorexia, weight loss, anaemia, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, fever, change in bowel habits, etc. depending upon the organ involved. In Unani System of Medicine it is described as a type of tumor which comes under the category of Awram Sawdaviya. It is caused by the production of Sawda Ghair Tabayee (Abnormal melancholic humour). Important Facts According to World Health Organization (WHO), some important facts about cancer are as follows - \u00b7 There are more than 100 types of cancers which can affect any part of the body. \u00b7 Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases and 8.2 million deaths in 2012. \u00b7 It is expected that the number of new cases may rise by 70% over the next two decades. \u00b7 The five most common sites of cancer in males are lungs, stomach, liver, colorectal and esophagus. \u00b7 The five most common sites of cancer in females are breast, lung, stomach, colorectal and cervix. In many developing countries, cervical cancer is the most common. \u00b7 Tobacco use is the most important risk factor for cancer, causing around 20% of global cancer deaths and around 70% of global lung cancer deaths. \u00b7 Viral infections such as HBV/HCV and HPV are responsible for up to 20% of cancer deaths in low- and middle-income countries. \u00b7 In India, 900,000 people die due to tobacco related diseases per year. \u00b7 Tobacco contributes to 56.4% and 44.9% of cancers in men and women respectively and India has the largest number of oral cancer cases in the world. \u00b7 Breast, cervical and colorectal cancers can be cured if detected early and treated adequately.

It is due to the deficient production of the Insulin or defect in the receptor cells of the body. Unani physicians have described Diabetes Mellitus as abnormal functioning of the kidney and liver. Sometimes, this condition may also arise during pregnancy and subsides after childbirth. Important Facts \u00b7 In 2014, the global prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 9% among adults over 18 years of age. \u00b7 347 million people worldwide have diabetes. \u00b7 An estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes in 2012. \u00b7 More than 80% of diabetes deaths occur in low and middle income countries. \u00b7 WHO estimated that diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death in 2030. \u00b7 The number of people with diabetes in India is currently around 40.9 million and is expected to rise to 69.9 million by 2025, unless urgent preventive steps are taken.

Unani physicians described the condition as Imtila bi-hasb al-quwa results in increased blood pressure. Important Facts Hypertension is one of the most important non-communicable diseases (NCD) which is estimated to be attributable for nearly 10 per cent of all deaths in India. Prevalence of disease especially in adults has risen dramatically during last two decades from 5% to 20-40% in urban areas and 12-17% in rural areas. The number estimated to be doubled from 118 million in 2000 to 213 million by 2025. The role of the disease may be identified from the fact that 16% of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), Myocardial infarction ( MI) and 29% of strokes are attributable to hypertension. On the other hand a decrease of 10mmHg systolic or 5mmHg diastolic blood pressure may result in an approximately 20-25% lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and 40% lower risk of stroke. Causes According to its etiology, the disease has been classified into: 1. Primary Hypertension 2. Secondary Hypertension For most adults, there is no identifiable cause of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure, called primary (essential) hypertension, tends to develop gradually over many years. Some people have high blood pressure caused by an underlying condition. This type of high blood pressure, called secondary hypertension, tends to appear suddenly and cause higher blood pressure than does primary hypertension. Various conditions and medications can lead to secondary hypertension, e.g. endocrine diseases, kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, use of drugs and alcohol.

It makes the patients susceptible to accelerated atherosclerosis leading to cardiovascular diseases and stroke which are one of the major causes of premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Unani Physicians described Hyperlipidaemia as Ghilzat al-Dam due to predominance of Balgham (phlegm) which causes narrowing of vessels (Tazayyuq al-Uruq) or its obstruction (Tasaddud al-Uruq) affecting supply of Rooh to the vital organs like heart and brain resulting in diseases of these organs. Causes Hyperlipidaemia may be categorized as primary (genetic) and secondary (lifestyle and other). 1. Primary hyperlipidaemia is probably due to genetic causes 2. Secondary hyperlipidaemia is due to certain diseases such as \u00b7 Hypopituitarism \u00b7 Hypothyroidism \u00b7 Diabetes mellitus \u00b7 Obesity \u00b7 Cushing's syndrome \u00b7 Nephrotic syndrome \u00b7 Chronic Renal Failure \u00b7 Chronic Liver Disease \u00b7 Use of drugs, e.g. oral contraceptive pills (OCP), glucocorticoids, b-blockers and diuretics \u00b7 Use of diets rich in saturated fat and carbohydrates \u00b7 Alcohol consumption \u00b7 Deviation from Asbab Sitta Zarooriya (Six Prerequisites of Healthy Living) Clinical Features \u00b7 Asymptomatic \u00b7 Sometimes it may appear as xanthoma (the deposition of lipids in subcutaneous tissue) or corneal arcus (deposit of lipid in cornea). \u00b7 Complications include coronary artery disease (CAD), heart attack and stroke. \u00b7 Most of the patients are asymptomatic, so they are only detected by examination of lipid profile.

When brain cells die during a stroke, abilities controlled by that area of the brain such as memory and muscle control are lost. A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may experience only a temporary disruption of blood flow to their brain (transient ischemic attack, or TIA). Some Important Facts \u00b7 Stroke is the third most common cause of death, after cancer and ischemic heart disease. \u00b7 More than five million people die from stroke every year in the world. \u00b7 It is also the most prominent cause of physical deformity. \u00b7 Three adults suffer from a stroke every minute in India and around five million people are disabled globally due to the brain attack each year. \u00b7 Its incidence is accelerating in developing countries due to unhealthy lifestyles. \u00b7 T wo-third of stroke victims are above 60 years of age. \u00b7 One-fifth of the victims die within a month of its occurrence and half the survivors become physically deformed. \u00b7 Hypertension accounts for 30-50% of stroke risk. \u00b7 Patients with diabetes mellitus are 2-3 times more predisposed to stroke. Ischemic stroke About 85 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes. Ischemic strokes occur when the arteries to the brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia). The most common ischemic strokes include: \u00b7 Thrombotic stroke - A thrombotic stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the arteries that supply blood to the brain. \u00b7 Embolic stroke - An embolic stroke occurs when a blood clot or other debris forms away from the brain, commonly in the heart, and is swept through bloodstream to lodge in narrower brain arteries. Hemorrhagic stroke Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures. It can result from many conditions that affect the blood vessels, including uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), overtreatment with anticoagulants and weak spots in the blood vessel walls (aneurysms). Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 37Transient Ischemic attack (TIA) A transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a ministroke, is a brief period of symptoms similar to those appears in a stroke. A temporary decrease in blood supply to part of the brain causes TIAs, which often last less than five minutes. Unani physicians have described different causes which may predispose to the disease which include Soo-i Mizaj baarid dam (predominance of Sanguine). Clinical Features: Although stroke is a disease of the brain but it can affect the entire body. The effects of a stroke range from mild to severe and can include: \u00b7 Hemiplegia (the commonest manifestation) \u00b7 Sudden weakness or numbness in arms, face or leg especially on one side of the body. \u00b7 Sudden trouble in the vision of one or both eyes \u00b7 Sudden severe headache with no known cause \u00b7 Difficulty in speech \u00b7 Difficulty in walking \u00b7 Dizziness \u00b7 Loss of balance \u00b7 Lack of coordination Prevention: To abide by the following principles of Asbab Sitta Zarooriya (Six Prerequisites of Healthy Living): 1.

Have the blood pressure checked at least once a month, and, if it is elevated, treat it diligently, to keep it under control. \u00b7 Stopping the use of both smoking and non-smoking forms of tobacco. \u00b7 It is preferable to avoid alcohol due to several other ill effects on health. However for individuals who consume alcohol the consumption should be moderate. \u00b7 Avoid binge drinking. It is a major risk factor for stroke because it can acutely elevate blood pressure. \u00b7 Include exercise in the daily routine. \u00b7 Consume a low-salt, low-fat diet. \u00b7 Prefer whole grains and whole pulses and eat 10-40 gms of unsalted non-fried nuts every day. \u00b7 Get screening for hypercholesterolemia. If more than 200mg/dl, lower it by lifestyle changes like regular exercise and change in diet along with lipid lowering drugs. \u00b7 Control diabetes, if present concurrently. \u00b7 Avoid deep vein thrombosis. If a patient is recovering from illness or a surgery and is in bed, make sure he/she exercises the legs by raising it up and down 10-15 times every dayIntegration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 41MARZ AL-QALB AL-HUDARI (Rheumatic Heart Disease) Marz Al-Qalb Al-Hudari (Rheumatic heart disease) is the most common acquired heart disease in children in many countries of the world, especially in developing countries. RHD is a chronic heart condition caused by rheumatic fever that can be prevented and controlled. Rheumatic fever is caused by a preceding group-A streptococcal infection. Ibn Sina had advised protection against sore throat infection to prevent RHD. Consequences of RHD Acute rheumatic fever primarily affects the heart, joints and central nervous system. The major importance of acute rheumatic fever is its ability to cause fibrosis of heart valves, leading to crippling valvular heart disease, heart failure and death. Important facts \u00b7 The global burden of disease caused by rheumatic fever and RHD currently falls disproportionately on children and young adults living in low income countries and is responsible for about 233,000 deaths annually. \u00b7 At least 15.6 million people are estimated to be currently affected by RHD with a significant number of them requiring repeated hospitalization and, often heart surgery in the next five to 20 years. \u00b7 The worst affected areas are Sub-Saharan Africa, South-central Asia, Pacific and indigenous populations of Australia and New Zealand. \u00b7 Up to one percent of all school children in Africa, Asia, Eastern Mediterranean region, and Latin America show signs of the disease. Diagnosis According to revised Jones criteria, the diagnosis of rheumatic fever can be made when two of the major criteria, or one major criterion plus two minor criteria, are present along with evidence of streptococcal infection. Major criteria \u00b7 Polyarthritis: A temporary migrating inflammation of the large joints, usually starting in the legs and migrating upwards. \u00b7 Carditis: Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) which can manifest as congestive heart failure with shortness of breath, pericarditis with a rub, or a new heart murmur. \u00b7 Subcutaneous nodules: Painless, firm collections of collagen fibers over bones or tendons. They commonly appear on back of the wrist, outside elbow, and front of the knees. \u00b7 Erythema marginatum: A long-lasting reddish rash that begins on the trunk or arms as macules, which spread outward and clear in the middle to form rings, which continue to spread and coalesce with other rings, ultimately taking on a snake-like appearance. This rash typically spares the face and is made worse with heat. \u00b7 Sydenham's chorea (St. Vitus' dance): A characteristic series of rapid movements of the face and arms without purpose. This can occur very late in the disease for at least three months from onset of infection.Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 42Minor criteria \u00b7 Fever of 38.2-38.9 \u00b0C (100.8- 102.0 \u00b0F) \u00b7 Arthralgia: Joint pain without swelling (cannot be included if polyarthritis is present as a major symptom) \u00b7 Raised ESR or C reactive protein \u00b7 Leukocytosis \u00b7 ECG showing features of heart block, such as a prolonged PR interval (cannot be included if carditis is present as a major symptom) \u00b7 Previous episode of rheumatic fever or inactive heart disease Prevention To abide by the following principles of Asbab Sitta Zarooriya (Six Prerequisites of Healthy living): 1. Hawa (Air) - Fresh and pollution free air for breathing 2. Makool o Mashroob (Food & Drink) \u00b7 Avoid tobacco, smoking, junk and smoked foods, cold and sour food items, preserved food, carbonated drinks, etc. \u00b7 Avoid taking sweets at night. 3. Harakat o Sukoon Badani (Bodily Movement & Repose) \u00b7 Avoid sedentary lifestyle. \u00b7 Exercise for 30-45 minutes at least five days a week. \u00b7 Promote oral hygiene and teeth cleaning to prevent throat infection. 4. Harakat o Sukoon Nafsani (Psychic Movement & Repose) \u00b7 Avoid mental stress and anxiety \u00b7 Avoid extreme emotions, e.g. anger, fear, sadness, etc. \u00b7 Lead a spiritual peaceful life 5.

Ihtibas o Istifragh (Retention and Evacuation) \u00b7 Avoid constipation \u00b7 Ensure proper evacuation, urination, perspiration and menstruation \u00b7 Avoid dehydration, and ensure retention of electrolytes and minerals Management Early detection leads to better prognosis. Unani treatment may be used as an adjuvant therapy for the following purposes in RHD patients: \u00b7 To restore the healthy lifestyle. \u00b7 To enhance the immunity of the patient, e.g. Khameera Marwareed, Jawarish Jalinoos, Jawahar Mohra, Sharbat Toot Siyah, Lauq Khayarshambar. \u00b7 To improve the quality life of the patients- Hammam (T and Riyazat (Exercise), etc. Home Remedies \u00b7 In case of sore throat, 5 gm pulp of Khayarshambar boiled in milk. Dosage: Gargle 3 - 4 times a day. \u00b7 For joint pain, equal parts of Kalonji, Methi dana, Ajwain are powdered. Dosage: 3 gm OD in morning with water.Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 44ROLE OF yOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF NCDs Yoga, being a science of consciousness, can play important role in the prevention, management and rehabilitation of diseases. The system of Yoga therapy is not symptom-based. It believes in treating the person as a whole. This holistic approach is aimed at restoring the abnormalities of body and mind physiology to normal, thereby restoring the health. Yoga has preventive, promotive as well as curative potential. Yoga-based lifestyle confers so many advantages to the practitioner that beyond doubt it is one of the best ever designed lifestyles in the history of mankind. Scientific studies have started giving documented evidence to this belief of the practitioners. Since lifestyle- related diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardio vascular diseases and hypertension are alarmingly on the rise in our modern society, Yoga-based lifestyle should be given special place in the prevention and management of these diseases. Today, Yoga has become popular because of its strengths in prevention and management of many lifestyle disorders including physiological and psychosomatic ones. Yogic component has been incorporated along with integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS to enhance rapid and gentle healing of lifestyle diseases. This chapter intends to give a brief overview about yogic practices formulated by Yoga experts to orient one and all through Yoga instructors / volunteers for comprehensive health benefits of individuals and communities. Benefits of yoga \u00b7 Increases - Feeling of wellness; Positive attitude; Energy levels; Blood pressure; Arthritis; and Tension in muscles Common yoga Practices for Physical Fitness The widely practiced These are certain special patterns of postures that stabilize the mind and body. They aim at establishing proper rhythm in the neuromuscular tonic impulses and improving the general tone of the muscles. b) Pranayama -These are the practices in the control of respiratory impulses which form one of the main channels of the flow of autonomic nerve currents. c) Bandhas and Mudras - This consist of practices where in one tries to consciously control certain semi-voluntary and involuntary muscles in the body by influencing the activity of the autonomic nervous system. Bandhas and Mudras help to tone up the internal organs, decongest them and stimulate their healthy functioning. d) Kriyas - These are cleansing processes, usually classified into six divisons and therefore they are often called Shatkarmas or Shatkriyas. Each one of these consists of many subsections. e) Meditation -This is continuum of mental practice involving from initial withdraw of senses to the complete oblivion of the external environment. Literally, there are innumerable stages and practices, which could be included under this head.Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 45ANNEXURE 1 Assessment of Built Muscular & Broad Fatty & Broad Muscular & Thin Skeleton Touch Hot & Soft Cold & Soft Hot & Dry Cold & Dry Hair Black, Lustry Thick & Rapid GrowthBlack, Thin & Slow GrowthBrown, Thin & Rapid GrowthBrown, Thin & Slow Growth Movement Active Dull Hyperactive Less Active Diet (Most Liked)Cold & Dry Hot & Dry Cold & Moist Hot & Moist Weather (Most Suitable)Spring Summer Winter Autumn Sleep Normal (6-8 Hrs.)

In patients with symptoms or documented postural hypotension (fall in systolic BP when standing of 20 mmHg or more) consider referral to a specialist. \u00b7 Refer immediately patients with accelerated (malignant) hypertension (BP more than 180/110 mmHg with signs of papilloedema and/or retinal haemorrhage) or suspected phaeochromocytoma (possible signs include labile or postural hypotension, headache, palpitations, pallor and diaphoresis). \u00b7 To identify hypertension (persistent raised blood pressure, above 140/90 mmHg), ask the patient to return for at least two subsequent clinics where blood pressure is assessed from two readings under the best conditions available. \u00b7 Measurements should normally be made at monthly intervals. However, patients with more severe hypertension should be re-evaluated more urgently. Procedure for Measuring Blood Pressure \u00b7 Standardize the environment as much as possible; i.e. relaxed temperate setting, with the patient seated, arm out-stretched, in line with mid-sternum, and supported. \u00b7 Correctly wrap a cuff containing an appropriately sized bladder around the upper arm and connect to a manometer. Cuffs should be marked to indicate the range of permissible arm circumferences; these marks should be easily seen when the cuff is being applied to an arm. \u00b7 Palpate the brachial pulse in the antecubital fossa of that arm. \u00b7 Rapidly inflate the cuff to 20 mmHg above the point where the brachial pulse disappears. \u00b7 Deflate the cuff and note the pressure at which the pulse re-appears: the approximate systolic pressure. \u00b7 Re-inflate the cuff to 20 mmHg above the point at which the brachial pulse disappears. \u00b7 Using one hand, place the stethoscope over the brachial artery ensuring complete skin contact with no clothing in between.Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 47\u00b7 Slowly deflate the cuff at 2-3 mmHg per second listening for Korotkoff sounds. \u00b7 Phase i: The first appearance of faint repetitive clear tapping sounds gradually increasing in intensity and lasting for at least two consecutive beats: note the systolic pressure. \u00b7 Phase ii: A brief period may follow when the sounds soften or 'swish'. \u00b7 Auscultatory gap: In some patients, the sounds may disappear altogether. \u00b7 Phase iii: The return of sharper sounds becoming crisper for a short time. \u00b7 Phase iv: The distinct, abrupt muffling of sounds, in quality \u00b7 Phase v: The point at which all sounds disappear is the diastolic pressure. \u00b7 When the sounds have disappeared, quickly deflate if repeating the measurement. \u00b7 When possible, take readings at the beginning and end of consultations. Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 48ANNEXURE 3 Measuring Waist Circumference \u00b7 Record the measurement of the circumference at a level midway between the lower rib margin and iliac crest in cms to the nearest 0.0 or 0.5 cm. Example: If the exact measurement is 87.7 cm, code the item 87.5cm. \u00b7 The circumference should preferably be measured on subjects while they are semi clothed, i.e. waist uncovered with the subjects wearing underclothes only. If it is not possible to follow this procedure, the alternative is to measure the circumference on subjects without heavy outer garments with all tight clothing, including the belt loosened and with the pockets emptied. \u00b7 Participants should stand with their feet fairly close together (about 12- 15 cm) with their weight equally distributed on each leg. Participants should be asked to breathe normally and at the time of the reading of the measurement asked to breathe out gently. This will prevent subjects from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath. \u00b7 A plastic metric tape should be used. The tape should be held firmly and its horizontal position should be ensured. It is recommended that the observer sits beside the participant while the readings are taken. The tape should be loose enough to allow the recorder to place one finger between the tape and the subject's body. The importance of the tightness of the tape should be emphasized in training. \u00b7 The length should be rechecked against a standard measure at least once a month and replaced as appropriate. \u00b7 The two sides of the tape should be differently coloured or have a scale only on one side. If the tape is uniformly coloured, with readings on both sides, one side should be blanked out. Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 49ANNEXURE 4 Measuring Body Mass Index (BMI) Height and weight measurement Measuring height: \u00b7 Height is measured in conjunction with the weight measurement. It may precede or follow this procedure. \u00b7 The height rule must be taped vertically to a hard flat surface, with no moulding (skirting board), with the base at floor level. A carpenter's level should be used to ensure vertical placement of the rule. \u00b7 The floor surface must be hard (tile, cement, etc.) and must not be carpeted or be covered with other soft materials. If only a carpeted surface is available, a wooden platform should be laid down to serve as a floor. \u00b7 The subject is asked to remove his/her shoes/footwear and heavy outer garments. \u00b7 To measure height, the participant should stand with his/her back to the height rule. The back of the head, back, buttocks, calves and heels should be touching the upright, feet together. The top of the external auditory meatus (ear canal) should be level with the inferior margin of the bony orbit (cheek bone). The position is aided by asking participant to hold the head in a position where he/she can look straight at a spot, head high, on the opposite wall. \u00b7 Place the triangle on the height rule and slide down to the head so that the hair (if present) is pressed flat. \u00b7 Record information on survey form to the nearest centimetre. For example, if 187.4, record as 187; if 187.5, record as 188; if 187.6, record as 188. \u00b7 Self-reported heights are not acceptable. Only persons who are immobile (e.g. amputees) may self-report their heights. Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 50Measuring weight: \u00b7 The floor surface on which the scale rests must be hard and should not be carpeted or covered with other soft material. \u00b7 The scale should be balanced with both weights at zero and the balance bar aligned. \u00b7 The subject should have removed his/her shoes/footwear and heavy outer garments (jacket, coat, sweater etc.). \u00b7 The subject should stand in the centre of the platform as standing off-centre may affect measurement. \u00b7 The weights are moved until the beam balances (the arrows are aligned).85 \u00b7 The weight is read and recorded on the form. Record weights to the nearest 200 g. \u00b7 Self-reported weights are not acceptable in mobile persons. Only participants who are immobile (e.g. amputees) may self-report their weights. Participants must not read the scales themselves. NOTE: Check for the zero level every day before starting measurement every day. Check the scales using standard weights at least monthly and whenever the scales are installed at a new location. If the error is more than 1 kg the measurements taken since the scales were last checked should not be used. Check for the zero level every day before starting measurement and immediately afterwards. The Body Mass Index is calculated by dividing the body weight expressed in kilograms by the square of height expressed in metres.

Five Steps of Breast Self-Examination (BSE): Step 1: \u00b7 Stand in front of the mirror with your shoulders straight and your arms on your hips and look at your breasts for: \u00d8 their usual size, shape and color \u00d8 whether they are evenly shaped without visible distortion or swelling Consult the doctor if there is: \u00d8 dimpling, puckering, or bulging of the skin \u00d8 changed position or an inverted nipple (pushed inward instead of sticking out) \u00d8 redness, rash, or swelling of the breasts. Step 2: \u00b7 Now, raise your arms and look for the same changes. \u00b7 Look for any dimpling of skin or in-drawing nipple. Step 3:\u00b7 While you're at the mirror, gently squeeze each nipple between your finger and thumb. \u00b7 Consult the doctor if there is presence of milky/yellow fluid or bloody nipple discharge. Step 4: \u00b7 Lie down and use your right hand to feel your left breast and then your left hand to feel your right breast. \u00b7 Use a firm, smooth touch with the first few fingers of your hand, keeping the fingers flat and together. Integration of Unani Medicine in NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke) 55\u00b7 Cover the entire breast from top to bottom, side to side: from your collarbone to the top of your abdomen and from your armpit to your cleavage. \u00b7 Be sure to feel all the breast tissue \u00b7 Follow a pattern to be sure that you cover the whole breast. Begin at the nipple, moving in larger and larger circles until you reach the outer edge of the breast. Also move your fingers up and down vertically, in rows. Begin examining each area just beneath your skin with a very soft touch, and then increase pressure so that you can feel the deeper tissue, down to your ribcage using fingers only. Step 5: \u00b7 Feel your breasts while you are standing or sitting. \u00b7 It is easier to feel the breasts when their skin is wet and slippery (like while taking bath). \u00b7 Cover your entire breast, using the same hand movements described in Step 4.
