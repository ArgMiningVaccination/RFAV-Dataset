Wayne, Ph.D. Bernard Osher Associate Professor of Medicine in the Field of Complementary and Integrative Medical Therapies Harvard Medical School Director Osher Center for Integrative Medicine Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School This year our Osher Center, jointly based at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), celebrated its 20th Anniversary. I am so pleased to share that our center, one of the longest standing academic programs committed to integrative medicine and health worldwide, is thriving and adapting to address society's ever changing needs. Our longevity and successes, some featured in this 2022 annual report, are due to multiple factors. First and foremost, we acknowledge the remarkable generosity and vision of Mr. and Mrs. Bernard and Barbro Osher and the Osher Foundation. Their early and ongoing support for our center, and now, the fleet of 11 centers that comprise the Osher Collaborative for Integrative Health, has been a core force shaping the arc of complementary and integrative health and 21st century medicine as a whole. Other key factors underlying our longevity and success are the wisdom, hard work, and courage of our center's founding leaders- David Eisenberg, Ted Kaptchuk and Helene Langevin; the support of the leadership of HMS and BWH; our dedicated team of directors, faculty, fellows, clinical providers and staff; and the partnerships and synergies we have forged through our evolving 'center without walls' network. As I embark on my third year as center director, I reflect on the many challenges facing the health of our society today. Superimposed on the day-to-day practical stresses of our individual lives are the ongoing complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical wars, erosion of long-standing democracies, and environmental degradation. Collectively, these stressors are wreaking havoc on our physical, mental, social, and spiritual wellbeing. In this context, my team and I remain committed to the Osher Center's core mission: ... advancing a model of health that recognizes the interconnections of the body, mind and spirit to enhance resilience and promote health and healing in individuals, communities, and the environments that supports them. In this year's report, we showcase our fifth signature Integrative Medicine Network Forum that explored the burgeoning global crisis of depression, and how integrative health models and practices offer promising strategies for its prevention and management. We highlight the diverse and probing topics of our monthly Grand Rounds, including group integrative medicine visits for addressing health disparities, salutogenesis and the neurobiology of both spirituality and acupuncture. We share how we are advancing our research by tackling issues such as cardiopulmonary and multiple chronic pain conditions, addictive behaviors and sleep disorders. With the recruitment of our new Director of Nutrition and Supplements Research, Dr. Howard Sesso, we introduce you to leading edge research centered on nutritional supplements for prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Finally, we share updates about our clinical programs to manage distress and burnout in health care providers, researchers, and hospital staff and how our clinical team is growing and evolving to provide care for the whole person-body, mind and spirit. With sincere wishes to all for health, peace, joy, and creativity in 2023!A message from our director Highlights ....................................................... 2 Research ........................................................ 4 Education ..................................................... 8 Clinical Highlights .................................... 12 Network Building ...................................... 14 Leadership .................................................. 16 Appendices ................................................ 19 Contents 2 2022 ANNUAL REPORT OSHER CENTER FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE Bringing a Multi-Disciplinary Lens to the Lived Experience of Depression Our fifth biennial signature Integrative Medi- cine Network Forum brought together over 30 speakers and attracted 800+ registrants for a unique two-day virtual conference experience. Together we explored integrative approaches to understanding, managing and treating the lived experience of depression. The rich dialogue straddled multiple disciplines from neuroscience to psychedelic therapies, and embraced different cultural and faith-based perspectives and demographically diverse patient case studies. The theme and reach of the conference attracted philanthropic support from the Weil Foundation, the Uberoi Foundation for Religious Studies and hospital sponsorship. Marking a Milestone: 20 Year Anniversary As spring blossomed in Boston, MA, the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital celebrated its 20th anniversary with a dedicated two-hour Symposium. Current leadership and special guests reflected on the progress made over the past 20 years and shared their vision and plans for our continued, collaborative evolution. The video recording from the symposium and additional 20th anniversary tributes by former directors, David Eisenberg, MD and Helene Langevin, MD and founding core faculty, Professor Ted Kaptchuk, live in perpetuity on our website, oshercenter.org.Developing and Diversifying our Leadership Team This past year, we welcomed Howard Sesso, ScD, MPH, from the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital as the Director of Nutrition and Sup- plements Research. Dr. Sesso adds a wealth of experience and expertise in diet and nutrition research to our portfolio. Matthew Kowalski, DC, Associate Clinical Director, was appointed as Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, rep- resenting a rare milestone for the chiropractic profession. We anticipate further leadership transitions in 2023 as Medical Director, Don- ald Levy, MD, steps down after 20 years at the helm of the Osher Clinical Center. Research Highlights In 2022, our research portfolio comprised 36 studies funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and a further 21 funded by foun- dations or philanthropy. These include the existing portfolios of Drs. Peter Wayne, Gloria Yeh, and Pamela Rist, along with the addition of Dr. Howard Sesso's nutrition and dietary supplement research grants. New studies initiated in 2022 include an NIH funded clinical trial evaluating multi-modal chiroprac- tic care plus Tai Chi for chronic neck pain, and a new NIH funded study evaluating online Tai Chi training coupled with Fitbit step counting to promote physical activity in sedentary cardiac patients.20th Anniversary Luncheon.

Hall, PhD, published her first book titled 'Placebos', through the MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series. In this volume, Dr. Hall, who has studied the placebo effect for years, reviews the history of placebos in medicine, tracing its evolution from fringe acceptance to its use as a control in clinical trials. She examines the power of placebos, showing how their effects can in- fluence clinical trials, clinical encounters and, collectively, our public health. David Victorson, PhD, Osher colleague from Northwestern University, launched our new programming in integrative medicine and planetary health with a Grand Rounds on the health and healing benefits of nature connection. Since then, our planetary health program director, Aterah Nusrat, MSc, harnessed widespread Osher Collaborative for Integrative Health (OCIH) through a survey and started serving as chair of the subsequently established Osher Embedding and Supporting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Over recent years we have increased our efforts in reflecting principles of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) in our programming, faculty and staff members, and by assuming DEIB leadership roles. In 2022, Education Director, Darshan Mehta, MD, MPH, served as Chair for the DEI Task Force for the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health (ACIMH) and sat on the Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) Committee for the Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine. In addition, Research Manager, Daniel Litrownik, BA, served as our representative on the Osher Collaborative Anti-Racism Coalition (ARC). In 2022, partially inspired by our participation in the ARC, Drs. Wayne and Mehta mentored MD candidate Eana Meng and Harvard College senior Karim Ishamel in the research and clinical domains of their 'Small Steps Healing Project' which brings mobile integrative medicine clinics to hard to reach and disadvantaged individuals in Boston. Their project was recognized with a poster award at our recent Network Forum. Dr. Wayne also mentored Bri- anna Jean-Laurent, a Northeastern University intern in integrative medicine research; her career plan is to become a naturopathic provider and health disparities researcher. Finally, we sought to reflect gender, professional, cultural and demographic diversity in our speakers for our events, including our monthly Grand Rounds and the 2022 Network Forum. Collaborative Planetary Health working group. Ms. Nusrat also moderated the closing panel discussion on social and nature connections in our Network Forum. In addition to introducing planetary health resources to our newsletter subscribers, she and Dr. Wayne developed connections with organizations such as the Planetary Health Alliance at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and delivered presentations at the Nova Institute for Health of People, Places and Planet's annual meeting. New Planetary Health Programming Symposia Development In 2022, we began planning a landmark two-day in-person international scientific conference, \"The Science of Tai Chi & Qigong as Whole Person Health: Advancing the Integration of Mind-Body Practices in Contem- porary Healthcare.\" This inaugural conference, sponsored by the Osher Center, will be held at Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA in September 2023. Drs. Yeh and Wayne are serving as the conference Co-Chairs. The key aims are to provide an international forum to disseminate research on tai chi/qigong and related mind-body movement practices in the context of whole person health; foster interdis- ciplinary dialogue and collaboration; address challenges in dissemination and implementa- tion; and shape future research agendas.

Here we highlight the findings from our research portfolio in 2022, including the new addition of nutrition and dietary supplements. ResearchRESEARCH5 OSHER CENTER FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE 2022 ANNUAL REPORTExpansion of Research Portfolio We have expanded our research portfolio with the onboarding of our new Director of Nutrition and Supplements Research, Dr. Howard Sesso, to create critically needed synergies between our existing research in integrative medicine with nutrition and dietary supple- ments, epidemiology, randomized clinical trials, and bioinformatics. Nutrition is at the core of healthy living, whether as part of a beneficial dietary pattern or the targeted intake of specific macronutrients, foods, beverages, or micronutrients. In addition, many adults regularly use dietary supplements for purported but unproven health benefits, which require rigorous research studies to determine whether supplements may - or may not - prevent var- ious health outcomes associated with ag- ing. With nutrition at the core of a healthy lifestyle, we look forward to building new research collaborations within the Osher Center and beyond. Showcasing Key COSMOS Findings Dr. Sesso has led several research initiatives in nutrition and dietary supplements with major clinical and public health relevance. Highlights include the recently published COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) on cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other health outcomes in 21,442 older women and men. Adults taking a cocoa extract supplement had a promising 10% reduction in total cardiovascular events and a significant 27% reduc- tion in cardiovascular disease death. Also in COSMOS, those taking a daily multivitamin, the most commonly used dietary supplement, had no effect on either cancer or cardiovascular disease. These find- ings for a multivitamin in COSMOS did not replicate an 8% reduction in cancer in another multivitamin trial conducted by Dr. Sesso in 14,641 middle-aged men, the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) II. More Findings Dr. Sesso and colleagues have also reported other important research findings this past year. COSMOS also examined the effects of the multivitamin and cocoa extract interventions on changes in tele- phone-assessed cognition in 2,262 participants in collaboration with Wake Forest. Those taking a daily multivitamin, but not cocoa extract, had significant improvements in cognition score over a 3 year period. In another study from the PHS II trial examining vitamin C and vitamin E supplementation on risk of gout, 500 mg/day of vitamin C - but not vitamin E - significantly reduced the gout by 12% among middle-aged and older men. These findings underscores the importance of future research studies to understand the short- and long-term health effects of dietary supplements, as many adults continue to take them without clear evidence of potential benefits - or risks. New Areas for Research and Collaboration There are several areas of research in nutrition and dietary supple - ments for which we are optimally positioned to leverage the rich, collaborative resources across the Osher Center research community - and beyond. First, teaching kitch- ens offer an opportunity to educate and empower individuals with tools to appropriately select and cook healthy foods for them- selves as well as their families and friends. Second, we will develop highly integrated lifestyle-, mind-, and body-based interventions that leverage the Osher Center's existing research strengths. Third, we will continue to test for the benefits or risks of dietary supplements such as magnesium, cocoa flavanols, and a multivitamin on an expanded set of health outcomes, leveraging both existing and newly initiated randomized clinical trials. Importantly, our expansion to Nutrition and Supplements Research will seek new communi- ty-based research initiatives to ensure that our goal to improve nutritional status, through diet and/or supplements, for the prevention of disease can be attained across the entire population including those most vulnerable.

New Nutrition and Supplements Research DirectionRESEARCH 6 2022 ANNUAL REPORT OSHER CENTER FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE Taking Mindful StepsRESEARCHChiropractic is one of the most widely used therapies for treating chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions, yet it has historically remained poorly integrated with medical care. Multiple new studies at the Osher Center have the potential to substantially advance the evidence base to inform chiropractic care's use and integration. Neck pain is one of the top five chronic pain conditions in terms of prevalence and years lost to disability, yet conservative care options remain poorly understood with few effective treatment options available. One NIH-funded study awarded to the Osher Center in 2022 supports a clinical trial evaluating multimodal chiropractic care for chronic neck pain. This new study compares the benefits of a multimodal chiropractic program alone, or in combination with Tai Chi, for reducing pain and disability. An innovative feature of this study is that chiropractic care and tai chi are provided through com- munity-based practitioners, increasing the generalizability and future scalability of the findings. The study is being led by Dr. Wayne; Drs. Kowalski and Rist are key study co-investigators and collaborators include researchers from the Palmer College of Chiropractic. Migraine is one of the top five leading causes of disability world- wide. The Osher Center has completed a pilot study that suggests that chiropractic care may be helpful in reducing the frequency and burden of episodic migraine in women. A follow-up study (pending funding from the NIH) will extend our evaluation of chiropractic for migraines to both men and women, and will include both civilian and military veteran populations. Led by Drs. Wayne and Rist, the study includes a partnership between the Osher Center, Yale Uni- versity, VA Connecticut, and Palmer College of Chiropractic. A key question underlying this research is how chiropractic care impacts the well-established relationship between migraine headaches and neck pain. Recommendations for physical activity and exercise are at the cornerstone for many health conditions including chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Implementing and sustaining physical exercise is a universal challenge. Recent studies led by Dr. Gloria Yeh (Director of Clinical Research) are leveraging the promise of newer technologies such as wearables combined with older wisdoms through mind-body therapies to help promote positive behavior change. One study called Mindful Steps is developing and testing a multi-modal intervention that includes a wearable step tracker with individualized step goals and feedback, an educational and interactive website, plus a mindful movement video curriculum and live classes, specifically geared towards patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In 2022, Dr. Yeh received a grant from the NIH National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health for another study called Mind2Move that evaluates online Tai Chi classes coupled with a Fitbit to promote physical activity for sedentary patients who have had a prior cardiac event, such as a heart attack.

These include professional and public recognition of our providers, increasing financial stability despite ongoing COVID-19 pandemic challenges, and expanded clinical programming. Increased Mass General Brigham (MGB) grant funding allowed the clinic to offer and expand our popular resiliency programs for MGB employees and their families. We also hired new integrative medicine providers to grow our talented clinical team. Finally, our current financial model of co-locating MGB medical practitioners continues to bolster revenue and provide year-over-year financial stability. Leading with Compassion: Donald Levy, MD After 20 years as Medical Director, Dr. Donald Levy will be stepping down in 2023 and ushering in the next generation of clinic leadership. This marks twenty years since Dr. Levy brought together and united the first members of the OCC team around his vision to relieve suffering. It is this organizing principle that has guided the clinic's mission for the past two decades. A precious friend and a pillar of support to the whole clinical team, Dr. Levy has shaped and led one of the longest standing integrative medicine clinics based in an academic hospital in the US. Fortunately, Dr. Levy will remain an integral member of the OCC team, continuing to care for his patients and mentoring his colleagues. Harvard Medical School Recognition of Chiropractic Care In 2022, Matthew Kowalski, DC, Associate Clinical Di- rector at the Osher Clinical Center, was appointed as an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. This rare milestone marks another success in inter- disciplinary collaboration between the medical and chiropractic profes- sions. Dr. Kowalski's career has focused on integrating chiropractic treatment and education with the medical professions. As early as 1992, Kowalski was the first to bring chiropractic care into a Massachusetts hospital. With the leader- ship of the Osher Center at HMS, he continues to move patient care and the chiropractic profes- sion forward through research and educational programs. The Lavine Family Distinguished Chair in Neurology: Carolyn Bernstein, MD Carolyn Bernstein, MD, is the first incumbent of the Lavine Family Distinguished Chair in Neurology.

Tai chi is a promising multi-modal mind-body exercise that provides multiple physical, cognitive-emotional, and behavioral benefits and may be an ideal exercise, particularly for sedentary individuals. This application develops a more aerobically intense tai chi intervention that has the potential to significantly impact a large proportion of the population to decrease cardiovascular risk Peter Wayne (MPI) Gloria Yeh (MPI) Investigating brain mechanisms of interoception as a predictor of treatment response to a combined mindfulness and vagus nerve stimulation intervention for anxiety. NCCIH K01 Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award (PA-20-176)Anxiety disorders are characterized by dysregulation among brain mechanisms of interoceptive awareness, and have previously had mixed responses to mindfulness-based interventions. Vagus nerve stimulation may augment mindfulness interventions for anxiety by directly targeting mechanisms of interoceptive awareness in the central autonomic nervous system. We proposed to investigate how brain response during interoceptive attention, along with anxiety symptom profiles including interoceptive hypersensitivity, may predict the response to a multimodal treatment approach combining a mindfulness-based intervention with transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation.Michael Datko (PI) Implementing brief web-based acceptance and commitment therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain in an urban community health center National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health; 1K23AT012207-01 (2022)The goal of the proposed study is to establish the feasibility of implementing a web-based, self-guided acceptance and commitment therapy intervention with supportive coaching (PainTracker Self-Manager; PTSM) for chronic musculoskeletal pain in a community health center in the low-SES neighborhood of Roxbury, MA.James Doorley (PI) Mental health literacy in musculoskeletal healthcare providers: Identifying implications for practice, policy, and medical education West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute (2022)The goals of this project are to assess mental health literacy among musculoskeletal healthcare professionals treating patients who are vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes in rural West Virginia, evaluate providers' mental healthcare policies and procedures, and explore associations between providers' mental health literacy and mental health policy complianceJames Doorley (Consultant)SUBMITTED / PENDING GRANTS28 2022 ANNUAL REPORT INTEGRATIVE MEDICINESUBMITTED / GRANTS (Continued) Steps: A Web-Based Mind-Body Exercise Intervention to Promote Physical Activity in Chronic Cardiopulmonary Disease R01 AT012166 (2023-2028)The major goal of this remotely-conducted clinical trial is to test the efficacy of a multi-modal, web-mediated, mind-body program to facilitate physical activity and walking in patients with COPD and heart failure.Yeh (PI) Wayne (Co-I) Pilot of a Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention to Enhance Benzodiazepine Deprescribing USDeN (2023-2024)The objective of this proposal is to pilot test a deprescribing inter- vention that combines an established benzodiazepine tapering pro- gram with a novel, brief third-wave cognitive-behavioral intervention.Yeh (Co-PI) Kraemer (Co-I) Preemptive acupuncture for pain reduction and opioid sparing in head and neck Cancer: A pilot randomized controlled trial NIH / NNCCIH R34AT011544 (2022-2025)Opioid naive patients taking prescription opioids for acute pain increases the risk for developing New Persistent Opioid Use.
