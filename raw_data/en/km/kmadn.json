These tumors are typically not cancerous. A woman can have a single fibroid in her uterus, or she can multiple tumors in her uterus. Fibroids can be as small as an apple seed, or they can grow larger than a grapefruit. The U.S. National Library of Medicine and the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5051569/) report studies that have shown between 70 and 80 percent of women will develop fibroids sometime before they reach 50 years old.

Furthermore, a fibroid can shrink and disappear without any treatment. Your doctor may recommend treatment if your fibroids are causing you pain or interfering with your quality of life.

Chemicals can enter your body through the foods you eat, the water you drink, and through your skin. Some of the most common chemicals that disrupt your hormone levels and increase the likelihood of developing fibroids include dyes, fertilizers, fire retardants, nonstick cookware coatings, paint, personal care products, pesticides, and plastics. - Dietary Changes - The typical American diet is filled with [inflammatory foods](https://rosewellness.com/foods-that-cause-inflammation/)that can increase your risk of developing fibroids. Large amounts of red meat along with calorie laden foods can lead to fibroids. Instead of eating refined carbs, sugars, and saturated fats, opt for healthy foods. One of the best diets to follow when trying to promote health and eliminate fibroids is the Mediterranean diet. The Mediterranean diet is filled with fresh and cooked green veggies, legumes, omega 3 rich fish, and fresh fruits.

When applying a warm compress, do not apply the compress directly to your skin. Use a cloth or a towel to protect against burns. - Lower Your Blood Pressure - Research has shown women with high blood pressure are more likely to suffer from fibroids. There are several things you can do to help reduce your blood pressure, and thus reduce the risk of fibroids, including: - Use herbs and spices rather than salt when flavoring your food. - Avoid high sodium foods, including pre-packaged and processed foods. - Exercise daily. Seek to get 30 minutes of exercise on most days. - Lose weight, especially in your midsection. - Limit or avoid alcohol consumption. - Increase your potassium levels by eating a variety of potassium rich fruits and vegetables at each meal. - Stop smoking. - Take your blood pressure medications as prescribed. - Have regular physical checkups. - Traditional Chinese Medicine - Traditional Chinese Medicine employs a variety of herbal formulas to help shrink fibroids, keep the uterus healthy, and balance your hormone levels.
