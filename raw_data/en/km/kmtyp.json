The Global Health Security (GHS) Index measures country-level capacity to prevent, detect and respond to epidemics and pandemics in 195 countries, using 171 indicators. It benchmarks health security by looking at a variety of factors critical to fighting outbreaks, including biosecurity and laboratory practices, infection control, environmental risk, political risk, the strength of the health system, adherence to international norms, supply chains and logistics, and more. Immunisation is therefore a small, but critical, part of the GHS Index. In contrast, the Immunisation Readiness Index is focused entirely on immunisation, measuring the enabling environment for equitable and sustainable immunisation in 30 countries. This includes readiness to carry out routine and emergency vaccination. It does not measure a country's preparedness for a pandemic but rather, the extent to which national immunisation policies are ready to leverage the potential of vaccines, both now and in the future. My country performed well over the pandemic, why isn't that represented here? It is our intention that the Index will be used as a tool to understand the extent to which national immunisation policies, systems and practices are able to leverage the potential of vaccines to prevent and/or treat diseases now and in the future. As such, the Immunisation Readiness Index considers both routine and emergency vaccination: it does not measure a country's covid-19 response Still, any measure of immunisation readiness would be incomplete without proper consideration of the challenges countries faced in responding to the covid-19 pandemic. We have taken great care to account for covid-specific actions when scoring our indicators, applying the following guidelines: - We studied how each country implemented long lasting policies or practices because of, or during, the covid-19 pandemic. Points are allotted to countries for indicators where there is evidence that the policy or practice will continue beyond the covid-19 pandemic. - We considered policies or practices that have been implemented only in direct response to the covid-19 pandemic but without evidence of consideration of future vaccination needs. For indicators where there is insufficient evidence that the policy or practice will continue, or can be harnessed in the future, countries are not given points. We recognise that some countries demonstrated an ability to mobilise resources to respond to covid-19 without having pre-existing mechanisms in place to do so. For this reason, information about covid-specific policies and practices has been included in our data dashboard. Why hasn't manufacturing capacity been considered as part of the index? Manufacturing is a critical component of the vaccine ecosystem. In The Vaccine Ecosystem Initiative's report, Towards a stronger Vaccine Ecosystem: building resilience beyond covid-19, we discussed manufacturing processes, regulations and capacity to better understand global immunisation readiness. As an extension of the The Vaccine Ecosystem, the Immunisation Readiness Index captures the country-specific policy levers and mechanisms that can be used to develop, implement and maintain immunisation strategies to achieve immunisation readiness. Country-level immunisation strategies often rely on regional or international manufacturing processes to create the vaccines and related supplies required to carry out national immunisation efforts. Domain 2 of the Index focuses on the country-level components necessary to regulate the manufacture of vaccines and engage with manufacturers. Because it is not necessary for a country to be required to build and maintain their own manufacturing facilities, the index does not assess a country's capacity or ability to manufacture vaccines domestically.
