Your [immune system](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/the-immune-system) and diet go hand-in-hand, so eating a [healthy diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-eating-tips) can prevent you from falling ill. Take a look at a few important nutritional tips that can boost your immune system, and reach out to your local chiropractor for more lifestyle advice. 1. Eat Citrus Fruits for Vitamin C You have probably heard that eating [citrus fruits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3783921/) can help you stay healthy. Citrus fruits are a great source of vitamin C. Vitamin C plays an important role in the production of white blood cells, which help your body fight infection. Some of the most common examples of citrus fruits include lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruit. There are also supplements that can help you boost your vitamin C levels. 2. Consume Broccoli for Antioxidants Broccoli contains a wide variety of nutrients that are important to your overall health, including vitamins and minerals. Broccoli is a great source of vitamin A, C, and E. In addition, it contains a lot of fiber and antioxidants. All of these nutrients play an important role in protecting your immune system. If you steam your broccoli, you can preserve a lot of its important nutritional content. You might want to combine it with a bunch of other healthy foods that can help keep your immune system strong. 3. Red Bell Peppers Are A Great Source of Vitamins A and C If you are looking for another great source of [vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707683/), you may want to give red bell peppers a try. In fact, red bell peppers contain more vitamin C than citrus fruits! They are also a significant source of beta-carotene. Beta carotene converts into Vitamin A, which is important for keeping your skin healthy. Your skin is the largest organ in your body, and it plays an important role in creating a physical barrier against viruses and bacteria. You need to keep your skin strong if you want to stop yourself from falling ill. 4. Garlic Contains Allicin, an Important Immune Booster Do you love garlic? If so, you are certainly not alone, as this is one of the most popular spices in the world. It is popular in just about every cuisine, and it is important for keeping your immune system strong. Even though garlic has a wide variety of immune-boosting properties, one of the most important properties comes from a heavy concentration of allicin, which is an important sulfur-containing compound that protects your immune system. 5. Ginger Can Reduce Inflammation Finally, you may want to add a bit more ginger to your diet as well. A lot of people turn to Ginger when they feel nauseous or if they have a sore throat. That is because Ginger can reduce inflammation throughout your body, which is a critical part of the recovery process. Even though Ginger is used in a lot of desserts, it also has a bit of heat, thanks to [gingerol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27771925/), which is a relative of capsaicin. All of these compounds are important in strengthening your immune system, so you may want to add a bit more ginger to your diet if you want to keep yourself healthy.
