The origin of the Legend or its rationale is obscure or forgotten, and is usually based on misinterpretation of some fact of science or tradition. It is repeated, believed and repeated again from textbook to textbook, teacher to teacher, article to article and herbalist to herbalist, across a generation, and guides regular practice. A large number of such Legends, most arising in the last 30 years, infect the modern North American materia medica and weaken the effectiveness of our clinical practice. Each of the herbs, however, have some potent \"clinical pearl\" unrelated to the legend itself. We discuss Herban Legends and Clinical Pearls for by OBNMCost: US$ 70.00 Sambucus: A MSc, RH, CNSOriginal Date: journey to discover the Sambucus genera and their application, research and lore around the globe with specific clinical prescriptions as well as a presentation rich with the story and lore of these globally embraced plants.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNMCost: US$ 70.00 la Montagne, RH (AHG)Original Date: May 19, 2018Herbal First Aid takes advantage of widely available materials such as kitchen spices, weeds and wild plants.

Examples from the scientific literature will look at differences in chemistry when plants are dried, as well as a comparison of tinctures made from fresh and dry specimens of the same herb in a study conducted in part by Dr. Yarnell. Examples of herbs that are best used fresh vs. dried are presented. Clinicians are urged to share their own anecdotes and experience with fresh vs. dry herbs.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNMCost: US$ 70.00 Analgesics: The for Effective Pain ReliefPresenter: David Winston, RH (AHG)Original Date: May 19, 2018The search for effective, safe and non-addictive pain medication is an age-old quest. Studies show many people - especially the elderly, the poor, people of color and women - are undertreated for chronic pain. While herbs are not as powerful as opiates and other pharmaceutical medications, they can offer safer and often highly effective pain management. In this talk we discuss how specific herbs can relieve specific types of pain, how to combine herbs to create a synergistic effect and reduce inflammation, pain perception and spasm and how botanicals can enhance the effects of pharmaceutical pain medications. The focus of this class is to give the clinician the precise tools needed to manage pain with herbs. To that end we learn to describe the types and nature of pain, the location of the pain and the most effective combinations of herbs to treat pain syndromes. For too long herbalists have thought our ability to effectively relieve pain is very limited. This is untrue once you stop using generic \"pain\" herbs and understand how we can help control pain with precision and specificity in our herb choices. We also discuss some conventional pain medications and their limitations and adverse effects. Pharmaceutical classes covered include opiods, COX-2 inhibitors, NSAIDS.2.0 CEUs (including 1.75 pain management, and 0.25 pharmacy) approved by OBNM Native Infusion: Diabetes Prevention through Traditional TeasPresenter: Elise Krohn, M.Ed.Original Date: May 19, 2018Simply changing what we drink can have a profound impact on our health.

Strategies for educating people about the health impacts of sugary drinks will be included, as well as time to sample teas.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNMCost: US$ 70.00 Kevin Spelman, PhD, MCPPOriginal Date: May 19, 2018Organ reserve was first was described in the 80s by Dr. James Fries after seeing the significant variability in function in geriatric populations. Defined as innate and environmentally induced modes of favorable adaption that lead to extended cellular defense as well as physical and cognitive function, this construct is not just about genes. Environmental exposures such as diet and medicinal plants appear to play a significant role in extending functional capacity. Unfortunately, the paradigm of organ reserve is poorly understood in clinical therapeutics four decades later. We discuss this insightful and clinically relevant model and the implications of the trophorestorative plants that may preserve our reserve and induce the ability of organs to successfully return to their original physiological state following repeated episodes of biochemical, physical and emotional stress.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNMCost: US$ 70.00 The Worst Weeds are Your Best MedicinePresenter: David Winston, RH (AHG)Original Date: May 20, 2018Weeds are despised, poisoned and known for creating significant environmental damage. We spend billions of dollars and endless work hours in our attempts to eradicate them, while damaging our environment further by spraying toxic herbicides. What if there was a way to reduce their spread without dangerous chemicals that also provided people (and animals) with time-tested medicines to cure our ills? In this class we explore the medicinal use of common aggressive weeds and how they are used in other cultures (TCM, Ayurveda, TEM) as effective remedies. By encouraging the use of these plants we provide environmental benefits, reduce pressure on over-harvested indigenous herbs and have an almost endless source of fresh, potent and effective medicinal plants growing in our gardens, backyards, farm fields and forests.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNMCost: US$ 70.00 Healthy Grieving Guide to Death and DyingPresenter: Greta de la Montagne RH (AHG)Original Date: May 20, 2018We will describe little-known, but well-established facts about human physiology, each of which either demonstrates the wisdom and relevance of some traditional herbal practices in herbal medicine, or will change the way you use herbs with patients now.

The reasons for this are discussed, including the concept of \"herbs of commerce\" and how profit-driven enterprises has real toxic effects on clinical practice, the move away from contact with plants as urbanization continues unabated, as well as possible failures in the education system for herbalists today. Dr. Yarnell also discusses how to use some of these valuable, forgotten herbs. The case of revival of use of Pedicularis and Fouquieria is used to show that this trend can be reversed, and that there is enormous opportunity for clinicians and herbal scholars today to help maintain and broaden the materia medica.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNM - "}
