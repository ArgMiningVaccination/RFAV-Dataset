What's the ideal dosing of [insert brand name here] vaccine? What's the ideal timing between doses? Should the first dose be higher or lower than the second dose? Do we even need a second dose? Would three doses (a real thing with some vaccines, like hepatitis B) be even better? And as Derek Lowe correctly points out, the answer to every one of these questions is we don't know. There's no way to do an [effectively] infinite number of trials with every possible variation of dose and schedule, so we pick one or maybe two, run the trial with them, and if it works that's how we administer it. Which is absolutely the right way under normal conditions to handle things. Use what's been proven to work without unnecessary digressions into one person or another's flights of fancy. But the truth is I bet there is an ideal vaccine dose and schedule and that neither Pfizer nor Moderna found. I also think the difference between the regimen we're using and the absolutely perfect one is likely to be extremely marginal, and that there's considerable latitude around that perfect approach that's still well into the realm of \"good enough and then some.\" To my understanding, the US is currently more limited by distribution and administration than supply at the moment. There's multiple bits to dis-aggregate because there are different amount of evidence informing different decisions. -The vaccine candidates aren't doing multi-dose regimens out of the blue; the response from just the initial shot in some of the studies is not fantastic. This is likely a real issue with the A/Z vaccine, and likely an issue in >55yo groups with all current candidates. -Dosage isn't on the fly. Moderna started with three, dropped to two, and then picked the highest dosage for Phase III proper because older patients just weren't responding that well to 50ug shots. -There were approximately 180 people in the PhI+II moderna trial in a <55 cohort, and their response to the 50ug, two shot dosage was essentially identical to doing the 2x100ug regimen. This is the only 'desperate' measure (two doses of moderna, at half volume, in <55yo patients) currently being considered that has direct published evidence in a patient pool of any size. -There is a significant , well-founded concern about deliberately inducing a sub-optimal immune response in large groups of people. There is real suspicion in this specific case that the mutant strains may have been selected for in persistently infected immunosuppressed individuals given convalescent plasma. -As such, doing a single dose with the current candidates is a massive risk . There is virtually no data to speak of past the 3 week window for the Pfizer/BioNTech candidate (or 4 weeks for moderna) in patients with one dose. There were some people given one A/Z dose who didn't get the second dose for quite a while afterwards, but not many, and the A/Z vaccine most needed both shots to guarantee sero-conversion with reasonable titers in the first place.
