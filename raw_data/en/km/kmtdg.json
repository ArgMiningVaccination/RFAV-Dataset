NEW: LIVE REMOTE PROCTORING IS NOW AVAILABLE TO SIT THE ARC EXAM [Learn More](https://aromatherapycouncil.org/remote-proctoring/) What Our Aromatherapists are Saying Testimonials Aromatherapy is a self-regulated profession; ARC provides a valuable tool for demonstrating that a professional has, and continues to, put forth time and effort, investing in their own education. Being an RA is akin to a retailer showing batch-specific GC-MS results; it shows that a known standard from an independent testing agency has been attained. Sitting for the Registration exam was the only option for me! When I graduated with my Certification, I wanted to ensure that my clients around the world would never doubt they were working with a knowledgeable Aromatherapist. Having the RA designation behind my name not only instills confidence in my clients, but requires that I continually learn to retain my Registration current. I'm grateful for the ARC for safeguarding our industry. Melissa is a Transformational Coach and RA. She works from her home on Guam with men and women suffering from emotional neuropathy to help them live their best lives. Earning the public's trust and showing competency in a self-regulating, unlicensed profession like aromatherapy can be difficult. Achieving RA status elevates the level of professionalism of an aromatherapist and the industry while showing the public we perpetuate a higher standard of continued education. This trust is important in an unregulated industry. Who can the public trust to deliver safe, effective and ethical aromatherapy services? Only by using a Registered Aromatherapist can clients, health care professionals and peers be assured that they are receiving the highest professional standards of quality, knowledge and clinical skills available in the marketplace. As a Registered Nurse and retired Certified Nurse Midwife, the Aromatherapy Registration Council's (ARC) unbiased examination aligns well with my experience in continuing education and research. Aromatherapy is a growing complementary intervention that promotes health, wellness, efficacy, and confidence. Registered Aromatherapists can be trusted to deliver safe, evidence-based aromatherapy services to the public. The RA designation offers assurance to the public that an aromatherapist's skills have been tested by an independent, non-commercial organization. The closed book, proctored, four-hour exam is extensive. It demonstrates an individual's knowledge of the profession of Aromatherapy and requires proof of ongoing education through the years. I am proud to be a Registered Aromatherapist. Becoming a Registered Aromatherapist was important for me to set myself apart in the field. My clinical training requires I am dedicated to upholding ethical values, continuing my education, and I put safety first. A Registered Aromatherapist exemplifies these traits and I am proud to say I meet these standards. \u2014 - The advice of a licensed medical practitioner is recommended before beginning the use of aromatherapy & essential oils. As an Unlicensed Complementary & Alternative Practitioner, or UCAMP, as recognized by the state of California, where I reside, I, Amanda May-Fitzgerald, RA, provide education for a supportive, complementary modality to standard medical practices; I do not encourage the use of essential oils as a replacement for medical advice. I do not condone the use of Raindrop Therapy, Aromatouch, or the use of undiluted essential oils on skin or in the body. Aromatherapy Registration Council on Social Media "}
