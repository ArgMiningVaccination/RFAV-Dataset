Educational Presentations Salon and Spa ProgramsTABLE OF CONTENTS 2Newly Diagnosed1 3 4 5 6 Support Programs Children and Family Programs 4Mind, Body and Spirit Programs Wellness ProgramsNEWLY DIAGNOSED Physical Limitations It can be frustrating to not be able to do the things you were previously able to do. Sudden physical limitations can be a real challenge to cope with. Side effects, such as fatigue, neuropathy, dizziness and pain, can make it difficult to engage in daily activities and routines. Often, these limitations are temporary. Talk to your medical team if you are experiencing any of these problems to see what changes can be made and what options are available. It can also help to talk to loved ones and accept help when possible. Allow yourself to explore new or even old interests that do not require as much energy but still help you feel connected to the things you love. Whatever you pursue, remember to be compassionate with yourself as you go through this. Emotional Rollercoaster You may experience a wide variety of emotions as you go through cancer treatment. From sadness or anger at having to accept a cancer diagnosis, to worries and fears about pain or prognosis, to gratitude for the love and support of family and friends \u2014 all of this is normal. It can be a little unnerving if you are a person who usually does not experience such shifts in mood but, given the scale of what you are going through, it is certainly understandable that you would feel differently than you usually do. If you start to feel that the stress is overwhelming or the emotions are unmanageable, it may help to talk to a professional. Professional counselors are trained in providing tools and support during challenging times in our lives and can make a big difference in helping you process this experience to feel better sooner. Financial Stress Cancer is costly and, for some people, working through treatment may not only be difficult but necessary. It is important to know your rights when it comes to issues such as employment, financial assistance and disability. Many organizations are dedicated to helping people with cancer avoid financial toxicity and protect themselves from discrimination. Some organizations focus on cancer type, while others may help based on where you live or other demographics. Talk to your oncology social worker if you have concerns about finances, need help applying for aid or want more information on your employment rights. Ask for referrals to the organizations that can help. Once you have the information you need, sit down and make a plan to solve the issues that are causing you stress. Feeling more in control can bring you more peace of mind.
