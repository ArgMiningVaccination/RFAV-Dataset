When the body is not digesting and metabolizing food properly, a collection of gases and toxins is created which disturbs the energy flow. Polarity Therapy helps to clear the body of toxins by using cleansing diets as well as rebuilding health using strengthening yet easily digested foods. A Cleansing Diet The cleansing diet generally consists of raw or lightly-steamed vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, sprouted grains and legumes as well as the morning 'liver flush'. LIVER FLUSH or \"VITALITY DRINK\" 3-4 tablespoons of pure, cold-pressed almond, olive, or sesame oil Twice the amount of fresh lemon juice. Three to six cloves of garlic The juice of an orange or grapefruit. Optionally, add ginger and/or cayenne Blended or thoroughly shaken, this is, surprisingly, quite a pleasant tasting drink! This should be followed immediately with one or two cups of herb tea as follows: HERBAL CLEANSING TEA Make a tea with equal parts: licorice root flax seed anise or fennel seed peppermint fenugreek (Looking to purchase Polarity Tea pre-made? We recommend [Paths For Wholeness](https://www.pathsforwholeness.com/polarity-plus-tea.html).) THE REST OF THE PURIFYING DIET No other solids should be taken for several hours, but as much liquid as you like in the form of herb teas, fruit juices, or water. Make a lunch and light dinner of raw or lightly-steamed vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, sprouted grains and legumes. A Health-Building Diet After a period of cleansing, the Polarity health-building diet is oriented around a vegetarian diet using whole foods, and a mixture of cooked and raw foods. We use the Yogic concept of dividing foods into Satvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic categories. Sattvic foods help calm the body, such as fruits and vegetables; Rajasic foods give activating energy to the body, ie. grains and pulses. We encourage a balance of these types of foods, while moving away from: Tamasic foods such as alcohol and meat, which tend to be deadening to the vitality of the body. Our emphasis is to help create balance in the body; in terms of diet this means working towards a moderate nourishing diet. *NOTE: The Polarity Diet is provided here for educational purposes only; any changes to your diet should be made in consultation with your physician and/or a licensed nutritionist.
