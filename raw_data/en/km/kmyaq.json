But does it actually do anything?](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/young-blood-transfusion-new-york-clinic-730099/) - [Startups Flock to Turn Young Blood Into an Elixir of Youth](https://www.wired.com/story/startups-flock-to-turn-young-blood-into-an-elixir-of-youth/) But what has completely flown under the radar is the fact that plasma transfusions of young blood have been found, in clinical research studies, to have never-before-seen effects on chronic health conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autoimmunity, and many others. In today's podcast, with Mark Urdahl and nursing supervisor, Gloria, you'll get never-before-heard breakthrough information on how young blood transfusions really work for these conditions, along with their true effects on anti-aging and longevity. Mark Urdahl serves as Chairman and CEO of the Young Blood Institute, a non-profit corporation conducting clinical trials in the use of therapeutic plasma exchange as a modality to systemically prevent cellular senescence and the onset of associated immunological, neurological, and cardiovascular disorders. Mr. Urdahl and his team at the Young Blood Institute have also pioneered the concurrent use of the world's most advanced, state-of-the-art, ultrasensitive, high-precision blood serum measurement technologies to capture comprehensive \"big data\" of the human body, an unprecedented combination of testing technologies in human medicine or human clinical research, in order to understand never-before-seen correlations which might lead to discovery of root causes of age-associated disorders. He began his career with IBM Biomedical Systems, which, in partnership with the National Cancer Institute, invented the world's first automated blood cell separator, first commercially produced by IBM in the 70s as the IBM 2997. After IBM sold its Biomedical Systems business unit to COBE Laboratories in 1984, Mr. Urdahl became a systems engineer supporting IBM large systems accounts, including notable innovators in health care management. Mr. Urdahl went on to lead a distinguished career at IBM, where he held management positions in marketing and sales, technology development, corporate development. After IBM, he founded Applied Science Fiction (ASF), a digital imaging company where he served as Chairman and CEO, overseeing the development of over 150 patent applications and licensing its technology to nearly every major imaging OEM worldwide, including Nikon, Agfa, Minolta, and many others. Mr. Urdahl subsequently formed the Young Blood Institute as a non-profit 501 (c) (3) corporation to research anti-aging therapies under clinical trials, recruiting world-class principal investigators, establishing a nation-wide network of nurses and private care physicians, creating the most advanced biomarker testing platform in the world, and developing a \"big data\" database capable of storing data in the cloud in perpetuity. In 2008, Mr. Urdahl led an investment group to acquire the storage network monitoring business unit of Finisar Corp, including a portfolio of 20+ patents/applications, to form a privately held company, Virtual Instruments. He subsequently formed the Young Blood Institute to research anti-aging therapies under clinical trials, recruit world-class principal investigators, establish a nation-wide network of nurses and private care physicians, create the most advanced biomarker testing platform in the world, and develop a \"big data\" database capable of storing data in the cloud in perpetuity.

By proving it existed in the first place - Anecdotal data suggests the effects of plasmapheresis extends beyond the indication that is being treated - Cast a wide net, gather as much data as possible (treat the whole elephant) - What biomarkers are being tracked: - Standardized patient care physical exams - Muscle biopsies - Muscle function - Neurological/cognitive function - Many more - All tests done before the young blood transfusion - Not trying to cure; trying to prevent - Don't test for telomeres because it's testing whole blood - Each cell subset has different telomere lengths - Wide disparity in test results - Cells are aware of changes in environment, not calendar times - A dramatic real-life example of two 70-year-old Youngblood Institute patients...38:08 - The plasma that was withdrawn was rather putrid looking - After 2-3 treatments (removing old plasma, injecting young plasma) the plasma condition normalized - Getting rid of the old plasma really matters - Decrease in whole blood viscosity - Low shear viscosity: \"stickiness\" of the blood - What \"big data of the body\" is...42:55 - Digital biomarkers: Apple Watch, [HRV](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sweetbeat-hrv/id861966073?mt=8), sleep cycles, etc. - Unprecedented ensemble of data assembled in one place - Correlations (meta data) - Data is mined over time - The government's intervention in this type of technology...46:20 - FDA shut down a for-profit company in the field - Mark supports the FDA's action and caution - Infusions are additive; can cause circulatory overload - YBI does a transfusion; blood volume stays constant - Mark doesn't fear an FDA shutdown of the Youngblood Institute because they are in agreement with and support their actions - How something called a \"neuro protocol\" may lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of Alzheimer's...50:00 - Article: [Plasma exchange for Alzheimer's disease Management by Albumin Replacement (AMBAR) trial: Study design and progress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395854/) - An extension of current protocol: 6 treatments over a 6 week period - Add a partial monthly treatment for 12 months - Mark's lead nurse, Gloria, was the lead on the AMBAR study, and had shocking stories to tell - Could potentially lead to treatment of Parkinson's and ALS - 60% success in arresting the development of Alzheimer's [The End of Alzheimer's by Dr. Dale Bredesen](https://amzn.to/2YAYyH4) - Proper clinical trial: unbiased investigators who look at data, not the subjects - The role of a head nurse in a plasma transfusion...57:45 - It's largely a nurse's procedure - Top 6 nurses at the YBI have 230+ years of experience - Get lead physicians observations; head nurse will sometimes provide that for them - Interact with patients and get their observations - Alzheimer's affects the family of the patient more than the patient (due to their loss of memory) - Gloria's observations treating patients, both with the AMBAR study and at the YBI...1:11:11 - \"Early results on Parkinson's and ALS patients are very encouraging\" [Grifols](https://www.grifolsplasma.com/en/home)did a placebo test on patients: - Patients already had minimum mild level of Alzheimer's - \"Sham\" is used in the best possible sense - Patients perceived they were receiving the treatment when they were not - Treated over 180 subjects over a four year period - One patient in particular deteriorated rapidly while on the sham study - \"Predictive biomarkers\" are used to admit patients into the YBI treatments - Some of the good stories: - Orchard farmer in his 80's showed remarkable improvement after approx. 8 months (18 treatments) - Woman who just turned 60, lost her joy for life; after 2 months, daughter reported amazing progress; flirting with everyone after 5 months - Patients regain previously lost memories - Whether aspheresis can be used as an anti-aging treatment even if one doesn't have Alzheimer's...1:14:52 - \"Apparent health\" can be a misnomer; all of a sudden someone can have 3 major diseases - YBI doesn't treat patients as young as 30 years old - Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS symptoms begin very young - Why these studies and treatments are still occurring more or less behind the scenes...1:21:30 - And much more...
