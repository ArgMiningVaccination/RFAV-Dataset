Learn More: Description Women need specific nourishment from their vitamins that men and children don't need. We formulated an herbal multivitamin with the everyday woman in mind. Nourish Her Naturally is designed to fortify, improve, and nurture the female body. This tincture includes herbs that are packed with vitamins and minerals to help balance hormones, boost energy levels, and promote overall wellness. Herbal multivitamins use the power of nature rather than isolated mega-doses (which can create imbalances in the body). Women do so much and that requires the right support to keep them going. Nourish Her Naturally is formulated with nettle leaf, red raspberry leaf, dandelion leaf, catnip leaf, alfalfa leaf, and spearmint leaf - herbs that help balance hormones, promote energy and calmness, and provide your body with the essential vitamins and minerals you need to take charge of your day. Most \"multivitamins\" are purified, extracted, and synthetic (often with additives). They also have megadoses of vitamins and minerals that cannot be adequately absorbed by the body, which throws off nutrient balance. Nourish Her Naturally is different because it is made simply with whole herbs extracted in sustainable, vegetable glycerin. This herbal multivitamin provides nutrients in the proper amounts that your body can actually absorb. Nourish Her Naturally is a must have for female health.

A: Boys can also take Nourish Her Naturally, but around 8 years old they may want to take Nourish Him Naturally as it is formulated with male needs in mind. However, Nourish Her Naturally is still completely safe for boys to take. Q: Can I mix this with juice or a smoothie? A: Nourish Her Naturally can be taken straight orally or mixed with water, juice, smoothies, etc. Adding to juice or smoothies does not harm its effectiveness. Q: How does an herbal multivitamin work? A: Conventional vitamins in pill form are full of binders and fillers to make them keep their shape and hold all of the ingredients together. Liquid herbal vitamins are made without binders and fillers making them easier to digest. Plus, the vitamins you get are from real food sources and not synthetic making them more biologically friendly to your body! Q: The amount of vitamins in the tinctures are low, especially compared to what you buy in the store. Why? A: Because these are wholefood sources. Being natural and real food sourced, the amount of each vitamin will be lower. But being natural and real food sourced, it'll be recognized by your body so that most of it is used. Compared to synthetic options, where your body doesn't know how to and ( just can't ) use it all. "}
