As we gear up for Spring & Summer and continue to discover healthier eating habits, along with regular exercise and daily, natural, functional movements, to maximize our body's internal and external health, the Spring Cleaning Challenge is the perfect way to thrust us into \"Cleaning\" Up our Diets, meaning food intake and how we nourish and fuel our bodies. [Clean Eating entails choosing the least processed, most nutrient-dense foods - whole, raw, fresh, natural, organic real foods - Foods that are hunted, gathered, grown or picked from the earth, like our ancestors did 100 years ago. If it came from a plant, it's Clean, Real Food. If it was made in a plant (factory), it's processed, chemical products, likely high in sugar, sodium and manufactured chemicals that make us overweight, tired, sick and prone to chronic illnesses. Foods that are low in fat, high in fiber and loaded with essential vitamins and minerals and that are not processed (boxed or fast-food) help control blood sugar, increase energy and help us perform better physically, mentally, emotionally and intellectually - overall fitness is improved and enhanced through a clean, healthy diet! ](/storage/2013/03/Spring-Cleaning-Challenge-New.pdf) The benefits of eating a Clean Diet are many - clean foods, unlike processed foods are loaded with natural enzymes that aid in digestion, decrease inflammation and improve circulation, which helps the body remove waste and help our digestive systems function properly from the fiber found in clean foods. Eating clean can also boost your metabolism, increase our energy, clear our minds and help maintain a healthy body weight (as well as weight loss). For our April Spring Cleaning Challenge, there are 4 Models to Choose From - see chart above and challenge yourself on which model you could benefit from the most. To help teach moderation and the 80-20 Rule, we're emphasizing Both the Clean and Paleo Models with an option for 1 Cheat/Free Day Per Week. Don't underestimate how helpful this 30 Day Plan with 1 Free Day a Week can benefit you - it's a definite challenge! But, totally worth every bite! Stay tuned and check back for Tips, Recipes and Meal Plan Ideas throughout the month of April. Challenge yourself and be an INSPIRATION to others and challenge your friends, family, kids and co-workers to get healthy, clean up and experience the benefits. Be a Role Model and Choose your Clean Eating Model! This challenge is INSPIRED BY the 30 Day Paleo Challenge my husband, Trent, and I did last April, 2012. As a former \"cheese lover\" and someone who required 2 raw sugar packets & flavored coffee creamer in both cups of daily morning coffee, I learned that my pallet shifted and I no longer, to this day put any sugar or flavored dairy creamer in my coffee (I love the coconut creamer) and I don't care much for cheese or dairy anymore. I was shocked to discover this and continue to learn what works for my body and am addicted to learning and playing with real, natural foods and how a Clean Eating Lifestyle (not diet) makes me better internally (emotionally, mentally, spiritually & intellectually) and externally (physically). So, have fun, get ready because it's not easy, and be good to yourself and an INSPIRATION "}
