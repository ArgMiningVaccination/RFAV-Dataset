Ketones are chemicals your liver makes that your body uses as energy. But that's not all fasting does. It also offers health and mental benefits you might not expect. How Fasting Works The liver's ketone-making process looks something like this: [Glucose](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/glucose-diabetes) (sugar) is the main fuel your cells use to produce energy. Fasting uses the liver's store of glucose, causing cells to release fats. When these fats travel to your liver, they're converted to ketones your body uses for energy. Before humans learned how to farm, people hunted and gathered food to survive. They would go long stretches without eating. It took a lot of energy and time to gather nuts and berries or hunt game. The human body adapted to that by using what stores of energy it had. Today you don't have to hunt and gather your food the way your ancestors did, but fasting may still benefit your physical and mental well-being. With [intermittent fasting](https://www.webmd.com/diet/a-z/intermittent-fasting), you can eat only during a specific time. When you go hours without food, the body uses all its sugar stores and starts burning fat. This is a phenomenon known as metabolic switching. As your body burns through the calories consumed during your last meal, intermittent fasting prolongs that period and then begins burning fat. During the times you're not eating, you can drink water and zero-calorie beverages such as black coffee and tea. And during your eating periods, you can \"eat normally,\" but that doesn't mean eating whatever you want. It's recommended to stay away from high-calorie junk food, fried food, and treats.

It involves eating every day within an eight-hour window and then fasting for 16 hours after your last meal. 5:2 approach. This approach involves regularly eating five days a week. For the remaining two days, you limit yourself to a single 500-600 calorie meal. Longer periods without food, such as 24-, 36-, 48-, and 72-hour fasting periods, may be dangerous. If you go too long without eating, it might encourage your body to store more fat in response to starvation. If you want to fast the right way, learn about the best methods and test them. Benefits of Fasting Mental function. When you fast, your body has less toxic materials flowing through the blood and lymphatic system, making it easier for you to think. While fasting, the energy you'd normally use to digest food is available to be used by the brain. You likely won't notice this mental change until the first few days of a fast because your body takes time to adjust. You might have headaches or pain points at the beginning of the process. But after your body clears itself of toxins, your brain has access to a cleaner bloodstream, resulting in clearer thoughts, better memory, and increased sharpness of your other senses. Healing rejuvenation. Fasting puts your body through a rejuvenation experience. It dissolves diseased cells, leaving only healthy tissue. There's also a noticeable redistribution of nutrients in the body. The body hangs onto precious vitamins and minerals while processing and getting rid of old tissue, toxins, or undesirable materials.
