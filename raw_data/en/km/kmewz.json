Here are some tips to help you get a better night's sleep - in pregnancy and beyond. Watch what and when you eat and drink Cut down on caffeine Cut down on drinks and food that contain [caffeine](/pregnancy/diet-and-fitness/caffeine-during-pregnancy_3955), such as coffee, tea, soda, and chocolate. Avoid them entirely in the afternoon and evening. Drink less in the evening Drink more fluids early in the day and less in the evening. This helps reduce bathroom breaks in the middle of the night. Avoid heavy meals and spicy foods before bedtime Spicy foods such as chili and acidic foods such as tomatoes can cause heartburn and indigestion. So can eating a big meal too close to bedtime. If heartburn is a problem, eat lighter meals and eat them earlier. Give yourself two to three hours to digest your food before you head to bed. Snack before bedtime to discourage morning sickness If you're troubled by morning sickness, it may help to keep your stomach from becoming empty. Dietitian Bridget Swinney, author of Eating Expectantly, recommends eating a light bedtime snack that contains carbohydrates and protein. A high-protein cereal with milk, half a sandwich (egg, peanut butter or turkey are good choices) with milk, or a high-protein smoothie are all good choices. It's also a good idea to keep a dry, bland snack - such as crackers, pretzels, or rice cakes - at your bedside in case you wake up feeling queasy. Try some warm milk Advertisement | page continues below Drinking a glass of warm milk before bedtime is a time-honored way to bring on sleep. Some research shows that amino acid L-tryptophan (found in milk and other foods such as turkey and eggs) may make eyelids heavy by raising the level of certain chemicals in the brain, including serotonin and [melatonin](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/is-it-safe-to-take-melatonin-while-pregnant-or-breastfeeding_40007292). Others suggest the sleep-inducing effects of warm milk are all in your head. (You would have to eat a lot of the foods mentioned above for them to have an effect.) But if it helps you doze off, does it really matter? Warning: Don't go all the way and take tryptophan supplements - they're not safe during pregnancy. Learn how to relax Take naps A 30- to 60-minute nap during the day makes you more alert, sharpens memory, and generally reduces feelings of [fatigue](/pregnancy/your-body/fatigue-during-pregnancy_2911). A study by the National Sleep Foundation found that more than half of pregnant women take at least one nap during the workweek, and 60 percent take at least one weekend nap. Time your naps carefully, though. Napping too late in the day (or for too long) can interfere with your sleep at night. Don't let your \"worry list\" worry you Keeping paper and pen next to your bed may help relieve middle-of-the-night anxieties. When you wake up thinking about all the things you need to do the next day, write them down. If writing down your thoughts makes you worry even more, finish making your list of questions, concerns, and things to do at least an hour before bedtime. Then try to put it out of your mind until morning. Enroll in a class If you're anxious about [labor and delivery](/pregnancy/your-body/inside-pregnancy-labor-and-birth_3658872), [baby care](/baby), or [breastfeeding](/baby/breastfeeding/preparing-to-breastfeed_754), [sign up for a class](/pregnancy/your-body/childbirth-classes_161). Knowing what to expect can help put you at ease. You might also benefit from the camaraderie of other pregnant women. Do yoga and stretching Yoga and stretching can help you relax. And they have the added benefit of keeping you toned and flexible during pregnancy. Find out more about [prenatal yoga](/pregnancy/diet-and-fitness/prenatal-yoga_7862) and [stretching during pregnancy](/pregnancy/diet-and-fitness/great-pregnancy-exercise-stretching_588). Many gyms, health clubs, and YMCAs offer yoga and stretch classes. Some are designed specifically for pregnant women. There are also online yoga classes geared towards pregnancy. You can also create your own stretch routine with simple moves for your neck and shoulders, calves and hamstrings, and back and waist. Gently stretching your muscles during the day and before bedtime can make falling asleep easier. Massage Massage relaxes tense or tired muscles. If you visit a professional massage therapist, make sure the therapist has experience working with pregnant women and uses a table and pillow designed for that purpose. Find out more about [prenatal massage](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/prenatal-massage-help-for-your-pregnancy-aches-and-pains_11931). A professional massage isn't your only option, of course. Getting a foot, hand, or neck massage at home from your generous partner is a perfect way to wind down before bed. Deep breathing Breathing deeply and rhythmically can ease muscle tension, lower your heart rate, and help you fall asleep faster. Lie down on the carpet or your bed with your legs extended. If you're in the second half of your pregnancy, lie down on your left side or wedge a pillow under the right side of your back so you're tilted slightly to the left. You can put a pillow between your legs for support. With your mouth closed, slowly breathe in through your nose. Feel your chest expand as you gradually fill your lungs with air. Hold for a few seconds. Then exhale through your nose to the count of four. Progressive muscle relaxation Once you master this simple technique, it can really help you sleep. The general idea is to release tight muscles by first tensing and then relaxing them. Lie on your bed. Focus on one group of muscles at a time and alternate between your right and left side. First tense and release your hand and forearm muscles. Then do the same with your upper arm muscles, face and jaw, shoulders and back, thighs, and so on until you reach your feet. Guided imagery Guided imagery can calm your restless or anxious mind and help you slip into a deep sleep. Here's how it's done: Envision yourself in a beautiful, relaxing place. For example: You're walking down an unending path of flowers. Or you're watching clouds float by along the water's edge, one after the other. (Imagining movement will engage your mind more than a still scene, such as picturing yourself just lying on a beach.) Now imagine every detail of the scene, including the sounds, smells, tastes, and textures around you. If a relaxing setting and activity don't come to mind, try using an image from a photograph or magazine and filling in the missing details. Use the right pillows Using the right [pillows](/baby-products/maternity/cozy-pregnancy-pillows_10369713) can mean the difference between a sleepless night and peaceful slumber. For back and belly support Tucking a pillow between your bent knees supports your lower back and may make the recommended [side-sleeping](/pregnancy/your-body/whats-the-best-sleeping-position-during-pregnancy_7608) position more comfortable. A pillow tucked behind your back can also help you maintain a side-lying position while you sleep. You can experiment with regular pillows or check out pillows made specifically for use during pregnancy, sold online and in maternity stores. You'll find body-length pillows, C-shaped and U-shaped pillows, and wedges that support your belly when you lie on your side or to prop yourself up to a semi-recline. For heartburn If you suffer from heartburn, experiment with an extra pillow to raise your head while sleeping. Some moms-to-be find relief after raising the head of the bed - by sliding pillows under the head of the mattress, for example. (Talk with your health care provider about other potential remedies for heartburn, too, such as over-the-counter antacids and avoiding spicy foods.) For hip relief An egg-crate foam mattress pad placed on top of your mattress can also help you sleep more comfortably if your hips hurt when you lie on your side.

Practice good sleep \"hygiene\" Stick to a sleep schedule Try to regulate your sleep/wake schedule by going to bed and getting up at around the same time every day. Establish a regular, relaxing bedtime routine Develop a soothing bedtime ritual - such as reading or taking a warm [bath](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/is-it-true-that-pregnant-women-shouldnt-take-baths_10323724) or shower - for the 20 to 30 minutes before you turn in for the night. Make your bedroom a sleep sanctuary You may feel warmer than usual when you're pregnant, so keep your room on the cool side. Block out light and noise, too. They can wake you from a light sleep. Avoid technology in the bedroom (as well as an hour or so before bedtime). Use a nightlight to make your bathroom trips easier. Use your bed only for sleep and sex If you're in the habit of paying bills or watching television in bed, stop. Reserve your bed for other enjoyable activities like sleep, sex, and light reading. Sleep on your side Train yourself to sleep on your side. This position helps blood and nutrients flow to your baby and uterus, and helps your body eliminate waste and fluids. Getting used to this position early in pregnancy will help you sleep better when your belly is bigger. If you just can't sleep... Get out of bed If you're still awake after 20 or 30 minutes, get up and go into another room. Listen to soothing music or read a magazine. When you feel drowsy, go back to bed. Don't worry If you wake up at night, don't fret! Interrupted sleep during pregnancy is perfectly natural. Can I take sleep medication during pregnancy? Ideally you'll be able to avoid all medications during pregnancy. Most drugs haven't been tested on pregnant women, and it can be hard to know what effect they'll have on your baby. If you have a severe sleep problem or disorder, though, your doctor or midwife may recommend a prescription or over-the-counter drug to use during your second or third trimester. Gerald Briggs, clinical pharmacist and coauthor of Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation, provides the following guidelines. Note: It's important never to take any medication during pregnancy without first consulting your healthcare provider. Over-the-counter remedies Ask your doctor or midwife which [over-the-counter medicines](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/safe-medications-during-pregnancy_1486462) would be safe for you to try. The antihistamines diphenhydramine hydrochloride and doxyalamine are sometimes used as sleep aids because drowsiness is a side effect. (These ingredients are found in Benadryl, Sominex, and Unisom, for example. A combination of these ingredients is sometimes used in the first trimester for [severe nausea and vomiting](/pregnancy/your-body/hyperemesis-gravidarum-severe-morning-sickness_10376363) in pregnancy.) An important caveat: If you take diphenhydramine, don't take it with Restoril (temazepam, another sleep aid). The combination of these drugs has been linked to [stillbirth](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/understanding-stillbirth_10350846), so you'll want to wait until the first drug is out of your system before taking the other one. Check with your doctor or pharmacist to find out how long this will take for you. Other possible side effects include impaired alertness and dizziness, so don't drive or operate machinery after taking either of these medications. And again, check with your healthcare provider before taking any medication while you're pregnant. Prescription medicine If you're suffering from severe [insomnia](/pregnancy/your-body/sleep-problem-insomnia-during-pregnancy_7521) or [anxiety](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/anxiety-during-pregnancy_10415701), your healthcare provider may recommend that you take a prescription sleep medication. If you're considering taking one, you and your doctor will have to weigh the risks and benefits and determine exactly how often it's safe for you to take it. Here's what we know. A 2015 research analysis suggested that two types of sleeping pills - benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines - could raise the risk of [preterm birth](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/preterm-labor-and-birth_1055), low birth weight, small-for-gestational-age infants, and [cesarean birth](/pregnancy/your-body/c-section_160). Studies have also raised the possibility that using these medications while pregnant could cause breathing problems in newborns. Benzodiazepines used for used as sleep aids: amobarbital, pentobarbital, and secobarbital. Although the data are limited, birth defects have been reported with amobarbital when it was taken in the first trimester. In addition, using any barbiturate near delivery can cause sedation in the newborn that can last for several days. Other prescription sleeping pills risk of these drugs in pregnancy is not known but could be similar to those observed with the benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepines, and barbiturates discussed above. Avoid taking prescription sleeping pills during late pregnancy. There have been cases of breathing and muscle tone problems reported in infants exposed to these medications at that time. Finally, be aware that taking more than the recommended dose of any sleep medication can harm you and your developing baby. For example, high doses of diphenhydramine have caused uterine contractions that may lead to [uterine rupture](/pregnancy/your-body/uterine-rupture_1152337) or [placental abruption](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/placental-abruption_1425791). Never drive or operate machinery after taking a drug to help you sleep. Is it safe to take herbal sleep remedies while I'm pregnant? No, not without the guidance of a knowledgeable healthcare provider. There are dozens of herbal products that are said to help you sleep, but most of them haven't been studied to find out whether they're safe to use while pregnant or breastfeeding. It's easy to assume that herbs are safe to use because they're \"natural.\" But herbs can be as powerful as some over-the-counter or prescription drugs - and some are even potentially toxic. Herbal remedies aren't regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, so there's no oversight of what's contained within any herbal supplement you might purchase, and all the ingredients might not be listed on the label. Only a very few natural sleep remedies can be considered relatively safe in pregnancy or while nursing: ginseng, honey, nutmeg, and oats. But very little information is available even for these. There are many other herbal products that might be okay to use, but there's no information about their effects during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Here are some herbs that you should definitely not use if you're pregnant or nursing because they may be dangerous for you or your baby: American hellebore, arnica, and valerian. It's not known whether St. John's wort is safe during pregnancy, but it is not safe when breastfeeding. Melatonin - often sold as a sleep aid - is a hormone, not an herbal remedy. The effects of melatonin on pregnancy and a developing baby aren't known, so it's best to avoid using it during pregnancy and breastfeeding (melatonin is secreted in breast milk). If you do decide to take herbal remedies, consult your healthcare provider before taking anything, either on its own or in combination with other herbs or medications. That precaution includes [herbal tea](/pregnancy/diet-and-fitness/herbal-teas-during-pregnancy_3537). Also, since the quality of herbs varies by manufacturer, ask an expert such as a doctor, pharmacist, or naturopath to recommend a specific brand if your caregiver gives the go-ahead to try a particular herbal sleep remedy.
