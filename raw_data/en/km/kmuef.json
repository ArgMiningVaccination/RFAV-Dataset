The secondary BMS only includes nutritional deficiency, such as Vitamin B12, folate, iron, zinc. At first, the primary BMS patients are treated with 0.5~1 mg clonazepam every day before sleep for 8 weeks. The secondary BMS patients are treated with vitamin B12, folate, iron and zinc according to the patient's nutritional deficiency status. Patients with no improvement or little improvement after the first stage of Western medicine management will be arranged to receive traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy. All patients will receive the TCM model, including TCM doctor, automatic tongue diagnostic system (ATDS), and body constitutional questionnaire (BCQ), evaluations. The results of this study are expected to understand whether adjuvant TCM treatment of BMS can improve treatment efficacy. The investigators will understand whether the constitution pattern may be a predictive indicator of efficacy for western BMS. The investigators will find a diagnostic indicator for the TCM model and apply it to the assessment of the prognosis of BMS patients. |Study Type Study on the Treatment of Burning Mouth Syndrome With Integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) and Western Medicine Based on TCM Syndrome Differentiation| |Estimated Study Start Date || Drug: Traditional Chinese Medicine | One bag of \" Qingre Liangkou Ningxin Fang\" at a time, three times a day for 12 weeks.
