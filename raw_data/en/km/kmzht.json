It has proven ineffective and has divided the practice of medicine into specialties, forgetting that the body functions in a constant state of homeostasis- all systems reliant on each other to function optimally. I believe that treating the underlying issue, down to the molecular basis, is what needs to be addressed in order to treat and eventually heal the disease. Unfortunately diseases have been categorized into separate entities when there is a common thread that is shared between them. My goal is to heal the mind & body as whole through integrative medicine.

Are there natural treatments for sleep problems? There are many natural treatments for everyday sleep problems. Reducing blue-light emitting screens, setting a regular bedtime, regular exercise, reducing caffeine and nicotine consumption, and keeping the bedroom dark and cool at night are all lifestyle changes that can help those who struggle with sleep but may not reach the level of an insomnia diagnosis. What's the difference between having trouble falling asleep and insomnia? Life events, stress, and anxiety can lead to sleepless nights for everyone from time to time.
