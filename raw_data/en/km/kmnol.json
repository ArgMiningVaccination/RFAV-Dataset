Since i ts inception, the University has based its educational, clinical and research programs on the following key principles: Treatment of the whole person. Prevention of disease. Teaching patients how to take responsibility for their own health. Enhanci ng each individual's inherent healing ability, using natural, nontoxic therapies. Over the years the University has broadened its mission to integrate Western scientific standards with traditional natural healing methods from around the world. The Universi ty has expanded and strengthened the academic and clinical education of naturopathic medicine practitioners. It has developed unique academic degree programs in acupuncture and Oriental medicine, nutrition, exercise science and wellness, herbal sciences and health psychology, as well as specialized non -degree programs that reflect its founding philosophy. Education of graduate natural health practitioners and highly qualified undergraduate students at Bastyr University emphasizes development of the scienti fic understanding of the structure and function of the human body and the disease process, balanced with a profound appreciation for, and ability to activate, the unique self - healing ability inherent in every human being. The University's educational appro ach is an integrated one, offering traditional didactic instruction combined with innovative, problem -based learning in a rigorous academic environment. The learning experience emphasizes academic excellence, the development of individual talents and maste ry of critical competencies. Students learn under the guidance of outstanding faculty. More than 90 percent of the University's health sciences core faculty members have earned doctoral degrees, and many are successful private practitioners who contribute a wealth of practical experience to the classroom. Laboratory experiments, demonstrations, clinical experience and case -oriented teaching help students develop practical, patient -oriented skills and understanding. Student clinicians are also trained to rec ognize when other modes of treatment are in the best interests of the patient and to make appropriate referrals to colleagues in other health care professions. Bastyr University is dedicated to educating individuals to meet the challenges of the twenty -first century. In practice and research, these professional healers will continue to integrate scientific methodology with the wisdom and proven benefits of traditional healing methods, while calling forth the intangible, and often miraculous, healing power n ative to each individual and living system. BASTYR UNIVERSITY VISION STATEMENT As the world's leading academic center for advancing and integrating knowledge in the natural health arts and sciences, Bastyr University will transform the health and well -being of the human community. BASTYR UNIVERSITY MISSION STATEMENT We educate future leaders in the natural health arts and sciences. Respecting the healing power of nature and recognizing that body, mind and spirit are intrinsically inseparable, we model an integrated approach to education, research and clinical service. BASTYR UNIVERSITY VALUES Compassion Community Integrity Connection to Nature Whole Systems Health In pursuit of its vision and mission, the University is characterized by: Academic exce llence: curricula that present the cutting edge of natural medicine philosophy and practices; programs that facilitate students' development of high -level academic and/or clinical expertise; utilization of teaching methodologies that optimally facilitate student skill and knowledge base development and an educational environment that incorporates and models the principles of nat ural medicine. Pioneering research: foundational inquiry into the underlying concepts of natural medicine; iterative research th at continuously evaluates the efficacy of therapeutic strategies and agents; and research partnerships to deepen and broaden the kinds of pos sible inquiry. Renowned clinical services: cutting -edge natural medical care; teaching that helps students model ideal clinical practice behaviors; and collaborations that provide the opportunity to explore and develop integrated care protocols and clinical practices. For the University to fully meet these commitments, it must think and act strategically. In Decembe r 2008, the University's Board of Trustees adopted and committed itself to the following core strategic initiatives: Strategic Initiative #1: Convene essential generative conversations that inform the cultivation of practitioners and influence policy decis ions that contribute to restoring the world's intrinsic health. Strategic Initiative #2: Determine what academic programs are essential to a robust and universal education in the natural health arts and sciences and ensure that each program is focused on t he achievement of excellence. Strategic Initiative #3: Attract, support and retain world -class faculty and staff in the natural health arts and sciences. Strategic Initiative #4: Attract, support and retain world -class students representing different cultu res. Strategic Initiative #5: Our methods of and access to instruction are innovative enough to attract the most diverse and qualified students, while maintaining the highest standards of academic, research and clinical excellence. Strategic Initiative #6: Establish a secure base of financial support and appropriate physical assets so we can invest in and support those things that assure we will always lead the way in education, research and clinical practice of the natural health arts and sciences. Bastyr University has played a major role in establishing the credibility of science -based natural medicine and helped initiate the current transformation of the health care system. We believe natural medicine has much to offer. In order to continue this leadersh ip and for the full benefits of natural medicine to be realized, we will continue to evolve Bastyr University into a fully developed, well - financed, mature academic health center.

REGISTRATION Bastyr University operates on the quarter system. The University's quarter is 11 weeks long. (Summer quarter classes are generally eight weeks; summer clinic is 11 weeks.) Eleven hours of class constitute one credit hour, and 22 hours of lab/p racticum constitute one credit hour. Continuing students preregister for courses and clinic shifts by submitting a preregistration form. The preregistration forms must be turned in before the registrar's office will register a student for classes or clini c shifts. Registration for continuing students takes place in the spring for summer and fall quarters and in the fall for winter and spring quarters. New students are automatically registered for their fall quarter courses before orientation week. Non -matriculated students may register for courses after matriculated students have been registered. Priority for courses is given to matriculated students. Students taking a course for credit have preference over students auditing a course. Students auditing a co urse or clinic shift (regardless of matriculation status) will be withdrawn if the course is full and an eligible student elects to register for the course, for credit. Students taking a course that is required for their major have preference over those ta king the course as an elective. Students may select to audit a course or change from an audit grade to a regular grade through the second week of the quarter. However, after the first week of the quarter, standard refund policies apply. Course add/drop/wit hdrawal forms are obtained from and returned to the registrar's office. Classes may be added or dropped from a student's schedule through the add/drop period (ending the close of the first week of each quarter). Assigned clinic shifts may be traded during the shift change period. Elective clinic shifts may be added during that same period. Clinic shift drops are accompanied by financial penalties. (Please see the registrar's office for additional information.) Withdrawal from classes is not permitted during the final three weeks of a quarter (see the financial policies section for the refund policy and page 140 for a refund schedule). For courses with concentrated scheduling (not evenly spaced throughout a quarter), the timing of additions or drops varies. ( In no case may students drop or withdraw from a course after the course has ended.) Students must check with the registrar for specific deadlines.

Automatic inclusion of parking fees with tuition or by payroll deduction is strongly preferred, but payment by cash or check is accepted if auto dedu ction is not possible. Citations range from $10 to $100 depending on the seriousness of the infraction. We do this to ensure that parking spaces are equally available for all. Citations are generally given to those who have not registered their transportat ion information, those who do not have the current Bastyr identification on their cars and those who are incorrectly parked. Notification of a citation is sent by e -mail; parking fines are due within two weeks. After two weeks, the fine is automatically ch arged to the student's account. For more information on transportation and parking issues, please see the Transportation web page on MyBU, which is within the Facilities section. OTHER COSTS Books and supplies cost approximately $700 -$2,000/year, depen ding upon the program of study. Second year naturopathic medicine students are required to purchase diagnostic equipment at the beginning of NM6221 Physical/Clinical Diagnosis 1 at an estimated cost of $1,000 -$3,000. REFUNDS Dropping all classes by or bef ore the end of the first week of classes entitles a student to a 100 -percent tuition refund. An add/drop fee is charged after the free add/drop period has ended. Any clinic drops are accompanied by financial penalties. (See clinic registration staff in the registrar's office for more information.) Refund calculations for drops or withdrawals from classes after the first week of the quarter are found on the inside back cover of the catalog. For those students receiving federal financial aid, the federal calc ulation for the return of Title IV funds is required, and refunds will be returned on behalf of the student to the federal government. Amounts are determined by federal regulations. Students with financial problems in the payment of tuition and/or fees sho uld contact the finance office at once to make satisfactory arrangements. The deadline for contesting a charge on a student account is 90 days from the close of the quarter in which the charge is applied or 90 days from the actual posting, whichever is lat er. Financial policies, like all policies of the University, are subject to change and revision by the management and/or Board of Trustees of the University. Notice of changes is published in MyBU. Facilities CAMPUS Bastyr University's primary academic and administrative facilities are located in Kenmore, Washington. The 51-acre site adjoins St. Edward State Park (with hiking trails leading down to the northern shore of Lake Washington) and includes a 186,000 square -foot building, play fields and foreste d areas.

BASTYR CENTER FOR NATURAL HEALTH THE TEACHING CLINIC OF BASTYR UNIVERSITY Bastyr Center for Natural Health is the largest natural health clinic in t he Northwest. As the teaching clinic of Bastyr University, Bastyr Center provides patient clinical services and student training in a professional clinical setting that emphasizes a holistic approach to care. Bastyr Center serves the health care needs of a diverse patient population, which includes young people, growing families and senior citizens from throughout the Puget Sound area. In 2008/2009, student teams, along with their supervising faculty, served more than 35,000 patient visits. Services at Bast yr Center include naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, nutrition counseling, homeopathy, mental health counseling and physical medicine. In an effort to meet the health care needs of our patients and to enhance the educational exper ience for our students, Bastyr Center provides specialized shifts throughout the year. These shifts are scheduled as needed and are subject to change. Current specialized shifts include an immune wellness program for people living with HIV/AIDS, diabetes a nd cardiovascular care, minor office procedures, ADHD, integrated pain service, biofeedback, and environmental medicine. In winter quarter of 2006, Bastyr Center moved to a newly renovated building in the Fremont/Wallingford neighborhood, designed to provi de, even more effectively, an environment that promotes health and healing for patients, staff and students. The expanded Bastyr Center also features a Chinese herbal medicine dispensary and a larger natural medicine dispensary, offering a wide selection o f natural health products and gifts. Bastyr Center recently became the first natural health clinic in the region to receive LEED -CI Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council for compliance with high environmental standards. LEED -CI is the recogniz ed standard for certifying high -performance green interiors that are healthy and productive places to work, less costly to operate and maintain, and have a reduced environmental footprint. Bastyr Center is located at 3670 Stone Way North. Parking is availa ble onsite for patients and on the street for students, faculty and staff.

Academic Policies/PROCEDURES This section on academic policies is intended to provide students with a working definition of some of the more important policies pertaining to their academic life at Bastyr University, inform students of their academic rights and responsibilities and outline administrative procedures. The detailed poli cies and procedures that apply to undergraduates are described in the catalog under Bastyr Undergraduate Programs. The Policy and Procedure Manual, Student Handbook and Student Clinician Handbook also provide information concerning other academic policies and procedures. ACADEMIC STATUS The University uses the following terms to denote academic status: Good Standing Academic Warning Probation Final Probation Suspension Dismissal A student whose status is anything other than Good Standing may be required to sign a learning contract and/or may be held to other sanctions. A change of status is the decision of the dean of the school and/or the student promotions committee. Depending on the nature of the academic deficiency, the categories above are not necessar ily followed sequentially. ACADEMIC SUSPENSION POLICY Academic suspension is used when the dean of the school believes the student will benefit from a period of time away from his/her program track, and when the student has sufficient opportunity to be s uccessful upon his/her return from suspension. The terms of a suspension are unique to each student and will be decided by the dean. A suspension will last at least one quarter, and a student may be required to receive remedial academic assistance before b eing readmitted. Suspended students must petition the dean for reinstatement; they may be required to meet with the dean and must show that all terms of the suspension have been met before receiving approval to return to the University. If a student is una ble to demonstrate that he/she has adequately resolved the issues that led to the suspension, the student may be eligible for dismissal. Removal from a course or clinic shift may be warranted in the case of a student's failure to adhere to instructions/pro cedures/professional expectations that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, student, staff or faculty. Removal from a course or clinic shift constitutes a failure of the class or shift and is not eligible for remediation; however, the student h as a right to appeal the final grade received. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DISMISSALS Recommendations for dismissals from the University usually occur in the case of the following: 1. Failure to satisfactorily adhere to the terms of a learning contract. 2. Failu re of the same class twice. 3. Failure of two clinic shifts. 4. Three failures in the same quarter. 5. A history of poor academic performance relevant to the appropriate department. 6. Removal from a course/clinic shift in the case of student failure to ad here to instructions/procedures that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient or class partner. DISMISSAL POLICY Each school of Bastyr University has a student promotions committee that follows the individual school policy for providing recommend ations to the dean regarding the potential dismissal of a student from an academic program. Recommendations for dismissal are submitted by the appropriate dean to the provost for consideration. The provost makes the final decision on student dismissals. APPEAL OF ACADEMIC SUSPENSION OR DISMISSAL Appeal of a suspension or dismissal is made to the provost and can only be made in the event of factual error. The written appeal must be made to the provost within five working days of the date on the suspension or dismissal letter. The appeal must specify and include the alleged documented inaccuracy and the relevance of that fact(s). The provost will respond within 10 working days to the appeal of academic suspension or dismissal and can only consider an appea l based on an error of fact. The decision of the provost is final and cannot be appealed. LIMITS ON STUDENT CREDIT LOADS Bastyr University degree programs are described in the Bastyr University Catalog . The recommended didactic program for each year and t rack of the degree programs is specified. Elective courses and clinic credits are expected over and above the required didactic courses. The Student Handbook specifies the requirements for full -time, half -time and less -than-half-time enrollment status for each program. Capable students may choose to exceed the full -time recommended enrollment in order to include important electives or special interests in their programs. However, the following are the maximum credit loads for which students may register in each program in any given quarter: Bachelor of Science ................................ 20 credits Master of Science in Nutrition ............... 18 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture ........ 25 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ............................... 25 credits Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ................................ ............. 30 credits Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine .......... 30 credits Students who are seeking degrees in multiple programs must plan their registrations carefully so that they do not exceed the stated limits. In extraordinary cases, very capable students may be allowed to exceed the maximum for their programs upon approval by their department chairs or school deans. Department chairs or deans indicate their approval by signing the students' registration or add/drop forms and noting the credit load being approved . Any approved increase may not exceed 10 percent of the above totals. ATTENDANCE POLICY Course and Lab Attendance Policy Bastyr University does not have a lecture (class) and lab attendance policy. However, faculty members may establish attendance requir ements in their course(s) or lab(s). Some state licensing boards and the Veteran's Administration require 90 percent attendance. Students receiving financial assistance from the Veteran's Administration or students who need to meet state licensing board re quirements are responsible for notifying the faculty of their need to document attendance. When a student has an excused absence, the faculty member may require that the student complete an assignment to make up for the time missed. An absence is considere d excused if a student has a legitimate personal emergency, a serious illness or a documented birth (midwifery students), as long as the student calls the faculty member(s) or leaves a message with the department informing them of the situation in advance. (24-hour voicemail is available.) Faculty may require documentation upon return from the excused absence. It is the student's responsibility to meet with the faculty member to discuss the absence and make up work upon return. Missing more than the stated attendance requirements for the class may affect the student's final grade, and a student may be required to take the course again. In addition to possible consequences for absences, habitual tardiness may be taken into account by faculty as part of the co urse grade and/or may be reported to the dean of students for sanctions under the student conduct code. Students cannot register for two courses or labs that are scheduled at overlapping times. Credit can only be applied to a single course at any one time. Students cannot attend a course without being registered for it and must attend the section of a course or lab for which they are registered. Failure to follow this policy may result in loss of course credit or a course grade of no show (NS). Clinic Atte ndance Policy All student clinicians are required to attend at least 80 percent of each assigned quarter shift in order to receive a grade of achieved competency (AC) for each shift. Holidays and emergency closures of the clinic do not figure into the tota l quarter attendance. A student who does not attend at least 80 percent of the shift (two excused absences) will receive a failure grade for that shift and lose all patient contacts and hours. The entire shift would need to be taken again. Exceptional circ umstances resulting in a third absence may be approved at the discretion of the supervisor. Four or more absences will result in an automatic failure for that shift. Please note that 100 percent of the required clinical hours must be completed before recom mendation for graduation. Please refer to the Student Clinician Handbook for details. Religious or Spiritual Holidays The University's policy is to attempt to accommodate the observance of religious practices. Religious absences will not count against any attendance requirement, but students are responsible for the information and material covered. Students must arrange with faculty to take missed quizzes and exams immediately upon return. Students observing such holidays are required to notify faculty dur ing the first week of classes and to find substitutes for clinic shifts affected. Bastyr University schedules clinical training and occasional required courses or intensives on weekends. A student with religious restrictions against attending classes on we ekends needs to contact his/her dean or program chair, in advance, when such a conflict occurs. Efforts will be made to resolve such conflicts, but a resolution cannot be guaranteed. Convention, Conference, Seminar and Workshop Attendance Policy Occasiona lly, there may be professional conventions or conferences offered during the academic year that programs encourage their students to attend. Students who wish to attend must receive permission from their instructor(s) in advance if there is an attendance r equirement, exam or project due. Students are responsible for the information and material missed. Students who receive permission must arrange with faculty to take missed quizzes and exams immediately upon return. Students must comply with the clinic abse nce policies. Please refer to the Student Clinician Handbook for details. UNIVERSITY CLOSURE In the event of unplanned school closures for weather or community emergencies, students are required to make up missed course requirements or clinic contact hou rs. Should the duration of the closure be too long or too late to make up missed requirements/hours in the time allotted, the university reserves the right to extend the quarter and/or year to allow for additional make up time. Please see the inclement wea ther policy/procedure on MyBU for more information regarding university closure. CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS Washington state law requires that all employees, students and other individuals who will have access in a health care setting to children under 16 years of age, access to vulnerable adults (as defined by state law) and access to developmentally disabled individuals must submit to a criminal history background check. The background check may require students to disclose information to the University about crimes and offenses against these populations. The background check also includes a Washington State Patrol criminal identification system report of the record of criminal convictions for offenses against persons, civil adjudications of child abuse, and disciplinary board final decisions. Each student is required to submit to a criminal background check before he or she is allowed entry into clinical experiences. Students should be aware that failure to submit to the criminal background check, any fal se statement in these documents by the student, or discovery of current charges and/or a record of conviction of offenses may lead to dismissal. The forms for these checks are distributed to students enrolled in programs requiring clinical training prior t o the student's first clinical experience. POLICY ON TB TESTING AND HEPATITIS B IMMUNIZATIONS These policies were enacted to protect the health and safety of employees and students who may be exposed to certain biohazards in the campus and clinic working environments. Tuberculosis Screening All faculty, staff and students who work or take shifts at Bastyr Center for Natural Health are required to be tested annually for tuberculosis (TB). TB screening information/forms are distributed to students in their Clinic Entry II course. Faculty and staff are required to provide that documentation to the manager of operations at Bastyr Center. Questions about TB screening can be directed to the Facilities and Safety Office, room 225. Students pay $10 toward the cos t of their PPD TB test at Bastyr Center. Bastyr University agrees to pay $37.50 toward the cost of chest x -rays, if required for students. This is 50 percent of the cost of x -rays at Bastyr's preferred radiology service. Requests for TB screening forms for students and faculty can be addressed to the Facilities and Safety Office, room 225. Hepatitis B Immunizations All ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students, AOM and ND faculty and staff at Bastyr Center, and faculty or laboratory and operations assistan ts who are category I (those who have daily exposure to blood or body fluids) and category II (those who have occasional exposure to blood or body fluids) are required to either take the hepatitis B immunization series, provide documentation that they have had such immunizations in the past 10 years, or sign a waiver refusing the immunizations along with a release of liability form. Bastyr University agrees to pay 50 percent of the cost of the hepatitis B immunization series for students.. Note: All student s are required to pay in full for the cost of testing antibody levels for any of the agents listed above, if they choose to check for individual immunity, prior to waiving or taking any immunizations. Commencement of the immunization series (or submission of a waiver) and TB screening shall occur before the first day of work for all faculty and staff, before ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students begin their shifts, and with the start of fall quarter of each year for entering AOM and ND students. Hepatitis immunization forms/waivers are distributed to students in one of their required clinical courses. Hepatitis immunization questions can be directed to the bloodborne pathogen safety officer; and requests for forms can be addressed to the Facilities and Saf ety Office, room 225. Anyone who has elected to waive the immunization series has the option to change that election, at any time, and take the immunization series. DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS To earn a degree at Bastyr University, a degree candid ate must have completed the prescribed curriculum (refer to the specific academic program section), earned passing grades in all required courses and clinic shifts, satisfied the requirement for total degree or certificate credits and been recommended for graduation by the faculty. To be eligible to graduate, a master's degree or graduate -level certificate candidate must have a minimum GPA of 3.0; a bachelor's degree candidate must have a minimum GPA of 2.0. Students in the articulated bachelor's/master's A OM degree program must follow the degree requirements of that school. A student is held to degree requirements in effect at the time of initial matriculation into a degree or certificate program unless legal or accreditation standards mandate a change to a n existing degree or certificate program. Those degree and certificate requirements are published in the edition of the Bastyr University Catalog that is in effect at the time of first matriculation. In rare circumstances, a course may be deleted from the required curriculum and/or curriculum substitutions may be made. A student who is readmitted after an absence of more than one calendar year may be held to the requirements in effect at the time of his/her return. A student may, by written permission of th e program chair, elect to graduate under degree requirements specified in a subsequent Bastyr University Catalog ; under no circumstances are the requirements from an earlier catalog applied. Students in the ND program and MSN/CHP program must complete thei r degrees within six years. Students in the MSA*, MSAOM*, MSN and MSN/DPD programs must complete their degrees (and any other requirements specified by particular degree programs) within five years. Students must complete the naturopathic midwifery certifi cate within three years of their ND graduation date or within three years of program entry if entering the naturopathic midwifery program after completion of their naturopathic medicine degree. Under exceptional circumstances, students may appeal to the de an of their school for a one -year extension of those deadlines. *This includes any requirements completed as a bachelor's student and applied toward the master's degree. Students in all degree and certificate programs must have discharged satisfactorily al l financial obligations to the University (tuition, fees, library fines, and all charges), including the graduation fee, for each program in which a degree or certificate is to be awarded. For students who have not met their financial obligations at the time of graduation, the earned degrees and certificates are posted to their records, but diplomas and official transcripts are held until the financial obligations are cleared. DEADLINES FOR THE AWARDING OF DEGREES The awarding and posting of degrees at Bas tyr University are governed by the deadlines noted below. These deadlines affect only the actual awarding of degrees. Students' participation in commencement ceremonies is governed by a separate policy. The dates for finals week each quarter are published in the Bastyr University Catalog and the registrar's quarterly calendar. For all bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and professional doctoral degrees awarded by Bastyr University: All coursework must be completed by the last day of the quarter for gra duating students. Any IP, I or PC grades must be replaced with passing grades no later than the last day of the quarter. If a student has any outstanding course or grade requirements on the last day of the quarter, his/her degree will be posted a t the close of the subsequent quarter or in the quarter in which the course/grades are completed/received. GRADING POLICY Grades are assigned based on the grading system of the department/program offering the course, rather than by the academic pr ogram in whic h the enrolled student is matriculated. Naturopathic Medicine/Naturopathic Midwifery/AOM, ND and Nutrition Clinic Shifts/Dietetic Internship Bastyr University provides a competency -based learning format in the classroom for students in the naturopathic med icine and naturopathic midwifery programs, all AOM, ND and nutrition clinic shifts and the Dietetic Internship program. A competency -based evaluation of student work and performance is structured on the premise of demonstrating competence of a well -defined set of information and/or skills. With a competency system of grading, a student is aware of the learning objectives and core competencies for each course and clinic shift; knows how knowledge and understanding of these objectives and competencies is meas ured; and has the opportunity to demonstrate mastery by means of quizzes, exams, papers and/or practical application. The competencies established for each course reflect the goals and objectives of the appropriate program of study. Program and department chairs in the professional programs, in consultation with the faculty, determine the requirements and standards that students must meet in order to determine whether a student has earned a grade of achieved competency, partial competency or failure. Profe ssional (ND, MW) Degree Programs, Dietetic Internship and Clinical Shifts AC - Achieved Competency PC - Partial Competency F - Failure I - Incomplete - personal emergency or serious illness W - Withdrawn -Withdrawal form must be completed, signed and filed in the registrar's office at least three weeks before the end of a given quarter. ABS students must contact the academic administration manager AW - Administrative Withdrawal IP - In Progress - for clinic shifts, preceptorship, clinic entry, th eses, didactic courses and internships N - No Grade CE - Challenge Examination NS - No Show AU - Audit WV - Waived ACHIEVED COMPETENCY (AC): A grade of AC indicates the student has gained the defined knowledge, information, skills and core competencie s and has met the learning objectives as defined in the syllabi. Students must attain a level of achieved competency (AC) in all courses, clinic shifts, and internships. AC grades are not factored into the GPA. PARTIAL COMPETENCY (PC): A grade of PC indica tes that an aspect of the learning objectives or core competencies has not been achieved and there is need for further study to earn the required AC. A PC grade does not indicate academic success. A PC grade must be remediated by 5:00 pm on the Friday at t he end of the break following the subsequent quarter in which the grade was received. Under unique circumstances, the faculty member or chair/dean may extend that deadline. Students may be required to complete a PC contract with the faculty member. Upon co nversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's office. The PC grade will be noted on the transcript as the previous grade earned and will appear on the transcript as AC/PC. PC grades that have not been converted to AC grades by the deadline revert to F grades. In that case it will be noted on the transcript as F/PC. The course, lab, clinic shift or internship must then be repeated. PC grades do not translate into partial credit on transcripts and are not factored in to the GPA. FAILURE (F): A grade of F indicates failure to meet the minimum level of competency for learning objectives or core competencies. A student who receives a failure in a required course, lab, clinic shift or internship must repeat that course, la b, clinic shift or internship. F grades are factored into the GPA until the course has been successfully repeated. INCOMPLETE (I): A student who is doing satisfactory work in a course but cannot complete the work because of a serious illness or personal em ergency may receive an incomplete grade by filing a request for incomplete grade form with the registrar. Incomplete grades may only be awarded in the last three weeks of the quarter, after the course withdrawal period has ended. Faculty determine the date by which an I grade must be converted; however, I grades must be converted no later than the end of the break that follows the subsequent quarter in which the grade was received. Under unique circumstances, the faculty member or chair/dean may extend that deadline. Students may be required to complete an I contract with the faculty member. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's office. The I grade will be noted on the transcript as the previous grade earned and will appear on the transcript as AC/I. ADMINISTRATIVE WITHDRAWAL (AW): A student who is suffering from a serious illness or experiencing a personal emergency and is unable to withdraw from term -based classes within the appropriate time frame ma y be awarded an AW by the registrar. The AW grade is also awarded when students are not given the opportunity to complete a course. IN PROGRESS (IP): IP grades are indicated for didactic courses that extend beyond one quarter by design, clinic shifts, prec eptorships, community practicum, clinic preparation, theses, internships, and clinic entry courses in which work may extend beyond the end of a quarter. IP grades for didactic courses must be converted no later than the end of the break of the subsequent q uarter in which the grade was received. All other IP grades must be converted by the program completion deadline. Faculty reserve the right to determine an alternate deadline. NO GRADE (N): N grades are assigned to indicate that a student is awarded no cre dit for a course but did not fail that course. N grades are commonly posted when a student withdraws from the University before having the opportunity to complete a multi -quarter course. N grades are administrative grades and are assigned only by the regis trar. N grades are not refundable. CHALLENGE EXAMINATION (CE): Please see Academic Policy 97 -C9 for details. NO SHOW (NS): NS grades are assigned to indicate a student did not attend all or most of a class. NS grades are not refundable and there is no cred it given. AUDIT (AU): Students generally audit a course for their personal enrichment. There is no credit given and no academic grade granted. The decision to audit a course or to change from an audit to a grade must be made by the end of the second week of the quarter. WAIVED (WV): Courses are generally waived if a student has demonstrated competency in a particular subject matter but does not have the appropriate level of coursework from an accredited institution to allow a transfer of credit. There is no credit attached to a waived course, and a student is required to make up the corresponding credits waived with additional elective credits. Undergraduate Degree Programs For the undergraduate degree programs (except Oriental medicine) a student must ma intain a 2.0 cumulative GPA in order to remain in good standing. Undergraduate students in the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine must maintain a 2.5 in their first year and a 3.0 in their second year. Any required course in which a student receiv es a failing grade (F) must be repeated. The letter grading system for acupuncture and Oriental medicine*, nutrition, exercise science, herbal sciences and health psychology undergraduate programs is as follows: A - 95 percent -100 percent or 4.0 A- - 90 pe rcent -94.9 percent or 3.7 B+ - 87 percent -89.9 percent or 3.3 B - 83 percent -86.9 percent or 3.0 B- - 80 percent -82.9 percent or 2.7 C+ - 77 percent -79.9 percent or 2.3 C - 73 percent -76.9 percent or 2.0 C-* - 70 percent -72.9 percent or 1.7 D+* - 67 percen t-69.9 percent or 1.3 D* - 63 percent -66.9 percent or 1.0 D-* - 60 percent -62.9 percent or 0.7 F - Below 60 percent or 0.0 AC - Achieved Competency - for clinic shifts, preceptorship, community practicum, outreach and practical courses PC - Partial Compet ency - for clinic shifts, preceptorship, community practicum, outreach, and practical courses I - Incomplete - personal emergency or serious illness W - Withdrawn -Withdrawal form must be completed, signed and filed in the registrar's office at least three weeks before the end of a given quarter. AW - Administrative Withdrawal IP - In Progress - for didactic courses, clinic shifts, preceptorship, community practicum, outreach, clinic preparation, clinic entry, senior year projects and practical courses N - No Grade CE - Challenge Examination NS - No Show AU - Audit WV - Waived For explanation of grading terms, see professional degree programs. *It should be noted that while a C -, D+, D and D - grades are passing, core classes or required elective classes i n the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine must be completed with a minimum of a C grade for passing. Students who earn lower than a C grade will be required to repeat the course. Graduate Degree Programs: (DAOM, MSA, MSAOM, MSN, MSN/CHP, MSN/DPD) For the graduate degree programs, a student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. Any required course in which a student receives an F must be repeated. The letter grading system for acupuncture and Oriental medicine and nutrition graduate progr ams is identical to the undergraduate system, as shown above, except for the following: There is no grade of D+, D or D - for a graduate student, and the IP grade applies also to work on a thesis. For explanation of grading terms, see listing under the prof essional degree programs. Grade Change Policy The grades of PC, IP and I are considered temporary grades and designed to be changed (see grading policy). The grades of AC, A, A -, B+, B, B -, C+, C, C -, D+, D, D - and F are considered permanent grades and ca n only be changed if a faculty error was made at the time of issuance. The faculty member must submit documentation demonstrating the error to the registrar. Students are not allowed to submit additional work after the quarter has ended with the intent to raise an A - through F grade. The option of \"extra credit\" work must be written into the syllabus and collected prior to quarter's end. F or PC in Sequential Courses If a student has an F or a PC that converts to an F in a sequence course, the student wil l not be allowed to continue in the next sequential course. If a PC grade is not remediated by 5:00 p.m. on the Friday at the end of the second week of the quarter, the student will be withdrawn from the course. INDEPENDENT STUDY POLICY Independent study allows individual students to study areas of interest not included in the regular curriculum with the aid of an instructor or a selected resource person. Registration forms for independent study are available from the Office of the Registrar. The deadlines for registration, payment and grading of independent study courses are the same as those for regularly scheduled courses. Required courses may not be taken by independent study. Students may take an independent study course only if they are in good academ ic standing. ND students may request to do an independent study after they have completed at least 50 credits of their degree program; acupuncture and Oriental medicine and nutrition students must have completed at least 30 credits of their degree program. Psychology students must have completed at least 45 credits of their degree program. Students may apply a maximum of five (5) credits by independent study toward the completion of their degree program. Students pursuing two majors as an undergraduate may apply a maximum of 10 credits by independent study, five (5) toward each program. Naturopathic midwifery students are required to complete two (2) credits of independent study as a part of their program. Each independent study credit should represent appr oximately 33 hours of work/activity. TRANSFER , WAIVER AND SUBSTITUTION POLICY Requests for transfer or waiver of credit must be submitted and reviewed within 12 months of a student's matriculation date or before the quarter in which the student is require d to complete the course, whichever comes first. Courses taken prior to entry at Bastyr can only be transferred to Bastyr during a student's first year of attendance. After the first year, previous courses taken can only be considered for waiver of require d Bastyr courses, and elective credits must be taken to make up the waived credit. If this timeline is not followed and a course is waived/transferred after the start of the quarter in which a student is registered for that course, the standard course refu nd policy will apply. The courses under consideration for waiver or transfer should generally be no older than seven years. Waivers and transfer credit will not be awarded for courses submitted for transfer after the quarter in which the student is expecte d to take the course at Bastyr University. If an enrolled student wishes to complete a program requirement at another institution with the intent to transfer or waive the course at Bastyr, the student must request approval in advance by submitting a petit ion to waive, substitute or transfer credits along with the course description from the other institution. Courses submitted for transfer that have not received prior approval are not guaranteed transferability. TRANSFER Transfer credit recognizes cours ework from another accredited institution as satisfying a Bastyr required course. Transfer credit grants credit for the Bastyr course and eliminates the need for the student to take that course. A petition to transfer may be requested by students who, at a nother accredited institution of higher education, have satisfactorily completed coursework that is the same in terms of content, level and credit as a specific Bastyr course, and meets or exceeds the academic objectives and competencies of a required cour se in Bastyr's programs. Transfer credit will generally not be granted for classes that are part of another earned degree or for classes that are taught at a different academic level. For courses taken prior to matriculation into Bastyr, transfer credit ca n only be granted within the first year of attendance. Transfer credit may be granted from institutions accredited by regional accrediting agencies that are recognized by the American Council on Education Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accredi tation and from institutions that are professionally accredited by the CNME, ACAOM and MEAC. Students who apply to Bastyr with credit from institutions outside the U.S. are required to have international transcripts assessed by an evaluation service recogn ized by Bastyr. Credits from schools outside the U.S. are evaluated according to nationally established norms. WAIVER A waiver does not grant credit; it only eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. Students are required to complete the equivalent number of credits approved via the waiver with elective credits. A petition to waive may be requested when formal training, coursework or experience has been earned at an accredited or unaccredited institution. Waivers are appropriate to request if: The course was part of a lower level degree that has been earned. A course was at an inappropriate level for transfer into a Bastyr program (e.g. a community -college level into a graduate -program level). A \"B\" grade or better has been earned in a course that is being used to waive a course in the naturopathic medicine program. The course would normally be transferred, but it is after the student's first year of attendance. In some cases a competency or challenge exam may be required before t he waiver will be granted. SUBSTITUTION In some cases, students may request to substitute one Bastyr course for another Bastyr course if the courses are the same in terms of content, level and credit and meet or exceed the academic objectives and compet encies of the required course. Substitution both grants credits and eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. For additional information regarding transfer, waiver or substitution of credit, please contact the advising/evaluations unit in the registrar's office.

Applications for the Dietetic Internship program must be postmarked by the appropriate ADA application deadline (typically February 15). INTERVIEWS Interviews are required for clinical, professional, and certificate programs. Applic ants are required to interview at the University's campus in Kenmore, Washington. Telephone interviews may be granted in exceptional circumstances. SELECTION FACTORS The programs at Bastyr University are committed to providing quality natural health educa tion to all communities. Applications from under -represented minorities are encouraged. The University supports equality of educational opportunity and, therefore, does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientati on, age, religion, creed, or handicap in admission or access to its programs and activities. The University encourages students of diverse backgrounds and experience to apply. For detailed program information, refer to the required skills and abilities sec tion (if applicable) in the appropriate school section. ACCEPTANCE Following completion of the application process a letter of acceptance is sent to those students selected. Those students who are making satisfactory progress toward the completion of thei r prerequisite requirements may be accepted with conditions. For these students, matriculation is contingent on successful completion of the requirements outstanding at the time of acceptance. The applicant must return a nonrefundable deposit to hold a place in the class within two weeks of receipt of the acceptance letter. The deposit is credited toward tuition at registration. Applicants have six business days from the University's receipt of their deposit in which to request return of the deposit. Follow ing this time, deposits are nonrefundable, even if applicants decide to reapply and enroll in a subsequent year. Offers of admission are made for a specific quarter of a specific year. For most degree programs, students are admitted only in the fall quarte r. An admissions file may be examined by the student (with the exception of confidential recommendations) only after acceptance and enrollment. Files remain the property of the University, and information contained within cannot be returned to or copied fo r the student. Certain items submitted for admission to the University are not considered to be part of a student's permanent academic record. Those items are therefore purged from the file upon receipt by the registrar's office. DEPOSITS All candidates f or admission who have been accepted into a program at Bastyr University are required to pay a nonrefundable deposit ($200 for degree programs) to hold a place in the entering class. The deposit is credited toward the student's first quarter tuition. Applic ants should be aware that the University may, without notice and at the discretion of the admissions committee, offer to another student the place of any applicant whose deposit has not been submitted within the specified time. Accepted students who wish t o take a summer course (i.e., general or organic chemistry), must pay a separate $100 nonrefundable deposit to hold their place in the summer class. This summer quarter deposit is credited toward the student's summer tuition. Continuing students are not re quired to pay a deposit for summer courses. Currently enrolled students who have been accepted into an additional program at the University are not required to pay a deposit. DEFERRAL OF ENROLLMENT Applicants who have accepted their offers of admission ma y request a deferral of their acceptance for up to one year. The admissions committee reviews the request and will either approve or deny the request. Those who are granted a deferral must pay the deposit for the year in which they initially intended to en roll by September 1. Deferred -acceptance students must also pay the deposit for the next academic year by the priority application deadline for their program. If deferred -acceptance students fail to make the second deposit, the deferral is rescinded and th e initial deposit forfeited. If deferred -acceptance students enroll, both deposits are credited to tuition. If deferred -acceptance students fail to enroll, both deposits are forfeited. Applicants who have not been admitted may request a deferral of their a pplication. GRADUATE -LEVEL TRANSFER CREDITS AND ADVANCED STANDING STATUS Students who have completed professional programs may be considered for advanced standing status. Students who have attended, but not graduated from, similar graduate or professiona l programs may receive transfer credit for individual courses but are not considered advanced standing students. For transfer consideration, credits must be earned from an institution accredited by a regional accrediting agency that is recognized by the American Council on Education Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation or from an institution accredited by the CNME, ACAOM or MEAC. Graduate and professional students must complete at least two -thirds of their credits at Bastyr University. S pecific information regarding transfer and advanced standing status policies for the naturopathic medicine program is included in that school's section (page 70). Specific information regarding transfer policies for AOM programs are included in the acupunc ture and Oriental medicine section (page 35). UNDERGRADUATE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER CREDITS AND RESTRICTED COURSES Bastyr University accepts undergraduate transfer credits earned at any regionally accredited college or university, provided the cour ses are similar in content and taught at the same level as courses within the curricula of Bastyr University. As the University is an upper -division institution, all undergraduates are transfer students.

Admiss ion to Bastyr University is competitive. All applicants are evaluated on the basis of academic records, narrative statement and applicable experience. Undergraduate students may transfer a maximum of three quarter credits of one -credit physical education credits toward the required 180 graduation credits. A maximum of 15 vocational, technical, CLEP or military credits may be applied to the elective credit total. Non -college level mathematics courses below college algebra, such as basic algebra and intermedi ate algebra, may be used to satisfy the basic proficiency entrance requirement in math, but the credits are nontransferable. Other non -college courses, such as remedial composition and English as a second language, are also nontransferable. For further in formation refer to the Academic Policies section on page 14. APPLICANTS WHOSE FIRST LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH All applicants for whom English is a second language must present evidence of proficiency in the English language in one of the following ways: Official TOEFL exam results of 213 on the computer -based test or 550 on the paper -based test. (PBT). Internet -based test (iBT) scores are currently set at 79 with a minimum of 20 in the speaking section. The new Internet -based test can satisfy the TSE requi rement if the minimum score in the speaking section is met. Official IELTS exam results of 6.5 or higher.* Two quarters or semesters of enrollment in liberal arts courses taught in English, totaling at least 15 quarter credits of co llege transferable c redits (not including vocational coursework or English as a second language), completed in an accredited U.S. or Canadian school, with a GPA of 3.00 or greater (no single course less than a \"C -\" grade or a 1.7 on a 4.00 scale). In addition, applicants to naturopathic medicine or the acupuncture and Oriental medicine programs are required to present exam results for the following: Official TOEFL exam results of 213 on the computer -based test or 550 on the paper -based test or 79 on the Internet -based test (iBT) score. TSE (test of spoken English) with a score of 50 or greater. (Only students with paper -based or computer -based TOEFL exam scores will be required to complete this test). TOEFL scores over two years old will not be accepted. The Bastyr Univer sity code for the TOEFL exam is #9839. Admitted students whose first language is not English may also be required to take additional elective credits and/or training to improve their language skills. *The AOM program does not accept IELTS scores. INTERNAT IONAL STUDENTS To be eligible for enrollment at Bastyr University, all international student applicants must submit an application, application fee, letters of recommendation, documentation of sufficient funds (see below), official transcripts or an evalua tion sent from a foreign credential evaluation service, and a current photograph. Priority application dates for the natural health sciences programs are the following: February 1 for the naturopathic medicine program, March 15 for all other programs. Appl icants who speak English as a second language are required to submit official exam results outlined in the section Applicants Whose First Language Is Not English. (See above.) Official transcripts from any college or university outside the United States or Canada must be translated and evaluated, course -by-course, by an independent evaluation service. The service forwards the evaluated transcript to Bastyr University, at the applicant's request. There is a charge for this evaluation. Forms are available fro m the service directly or through the admissions office at Bastyr University. Limited dormitory housing is available. Most students rent an apartment or house in nearby areas. International students must enroll as full -time, degree -seeking students and com ply with all related immigration policies for the F -1 student visa program. Federal laws require that international students maintain adequate health insurance while attending Bastyr University. All admitted F -1 students will be required to purchase covera ge through Bastyr University or submit a waiver form providing documentation of comparable insurance coverage valid in the United States for the duration of study. International students who have attended other medical school programs and are requesting ad vanced standing status in Bastyr University's naturopathic medicine program should ask for additional information about advanced standing status from the admissions office. These students must meet advanced standing requirements for the program to which th ey are seeking admission. F-1 STUDENT VISAS A nonimmigrant student and his/her spouse/children may be admitted into the United States in the F -1 classification during their course of full -time study. This does not include those applicants who hold dual citizenship, are lawful permanent residents (or have received confirmation from the U.S. Custom and Immigration Service [USCIS] of an adjustment of status to Lawful Permanent Resident), have a valid business visa, or, if by blood percentage, are 50 percent o r more North American Indian. However, Bastyr University requires official documentation of such status. Students with current F -1 visas transferring to Bastyr University must forward a copy of their current I -20. DOCUMENTATION OF SUFFICIENT FUNDS To qua lify for a student visa, applicants must provide complete and accurate documentation of sufficient funds to cover the cost of the first year of school, books and living expenses. Official bank statements, a signed letter of support or an affidavit of suppo rt (available from the USCIS), sponsor income verification, or other proof of liquid assets is required to document sufficient funds. The amount required to cover expenses for the first year is dependent upon the program of study and listed in the I -20 doc umentation work sheet, which is part of the application packet for international students. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND EMPLOYMENT International students are not eligible for U.S. federal or state -funded student aid programs but may obtain private loans with a U.S. citizen or resident as a co -signer. Canadian students also have access to the Canadian federal student loan program and most provincial loans. Documentation of sufficient funding is required for F -1 students because off -campus employment is prohibi ted by the USCIS during the first year of study. International students are limited to no more than 20 hours a week of on -campus employment while school is in session and may work full time during vacation periods, as long as they have maintained status an d intend to register for the following term. Bastyr University has a very limited amount of international employment money available. FINANCIAL AID The role of the financial aid office at Bastyr University is to assist students in obtaining the funding t hey need to reach their educational goals. Bastyr University participates in the full range of state and federal student financial aid programs. Student eligibility is determined following the state and federal regulations that apply to each particular aid program. Graduate students primarily rely on federal educational loan programs, including subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, GradPLUS loans and loans from the Perkins loan program. Employment opportunities are provided by the federal and state wo rk study programs. Additional support is provided by scholarship programs administered by Bastyr University from both endowed programs and University resources. Undergraduate students are also eligible for all of the programs mentioned above but are also e ligible for federal grants (Pell grants and Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants) and state grants (Washington State Need Grant and State Educational Opportunity Grant). Private loan programs also provide a supplemental source of funding, offering f unding to students at market rate interest. These loans require a positive credit history and/or a co -signer with good credit. All international students are eligible for University funded scholarship and grants and for on -campus employment from University funds. Financial Aid Deadlines: There are no formal University deadlines. However, undergraduate students are encouraged to apply by April 1 in order to receive consideration for several external grant programs with June deadlines. All students are encour aged to apply for financial aid at least 90 days before the first quarter of attendance. Detailed information on application procedures, program costs, and financial aid funding patterns are published annually in the Bastyr University Financial Aid Handboo k. You may request a copy from either the financial aid office or the admissions office. The Bastyr University Financial Aid Handbook and financial aid application are also located on the Bastyr website and the student portal. Satisfactory Academic Progre ss for Financial Aid Federal student aid regulations mandate that students who wish to be considered for financial aid must be making satisfactory progress in a degree or certificate program. This requirement applies to the entire period of enrollment at B astyr University, even though students may not have received financial aid for some periods of enrollment. Satisfactory academic progress is currently reviewed at the end of each spring quarter. It is also students' responsibility to monitor their own prog ress. All students must meet the published academic standards for their individual programs. Students placed on suspension or limited suspension are not eligible for financial aid. Undergraduate students awarded a State Need Grant or State Educational Opportunity Grant must complete at least 50 percent of the credits for which they received funding for that quarter. Failure to complete the required number of credits each quarter will result in cancellation of subsequent disbursements. Satisfactory acade mic progress is monitored at the end of each quarter for these two programs. See the student portal under financial aid for the complete satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid eligibility. Bastyr Undergraduate Programs MISSION STATEMENT FOR UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS The mission of the Bastyr University bachelor's degree completion programs is to help each student build a strong foundation of basic knowledge and skills, as well as fostering a greater understanding of health of body, mind and spirit. VISION STATEMENT FOR UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS The Bastyr University bachelor's degree completion programs provide students with opportunities to develop competency in basic skills such as written and verbal communication, critical thinking and the a bility to work cooperatively with others. The degree completion programs also provide students with opportunities to develop competency in the fundamental theories, models, core knowledge and skills of their major field of study. The degree completion prog rams uniquely emphasize the importance of holism and the natural health sciences. The programs provide students with opportunities to develop a deeper understanding of the interconnections between body, mind and spirit and learn to foster wellness in thems elves and others through approaches found in the natural health sciences. UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AT BASTYR UNIVERSITY As Bastyr University continues to develop undergraduate degree offerings, we strive to maintain consistency across all programs in terms of admissions requirements, shared courses, double majors and undergraduate student support. The undergraduate experience at Bastyr encompasses a range of academic programs, which are coordinated by the undergraduate committee. Admissions requirements, th e structure of interdisciplinary courses, double majors and general policy issues affecting undergraduates are all considered by this committee. The undergraduate committee works closely with the admissions office to ensure that applicants who meet all basic criteria are admitted to the University and to the undergraduate program of their choice. THE UNDERGRADUATE MAJORS Exercise Science and Wellness (Curriculum can be found on page 52.) Health Psychology (Curriculum can be found on page 49.) Herbal Scienc es (Curriculum can be found on page 65.) Nutrition (Curriculum can be found on page 51.) Nutrition and Culinary Arts (Curriculum can be found on page 56.) Nutrition with DPD (Curriculum can be found on page 54.) Nutrition and Exercise Science (Curriculum c an be found on page 55.) FULL-TIME EXPECTATIONS The undergraduate curricula are designed for full -time participants. Students may complete a program on a part - time basis, but should recognize that there may be scheduling conflicts between required courses . It is the responsibility of a student who wishes to complete a program on a part -time basis to work with an advisor to arrange an appropriate schedule. Special sections will not be offered to accommodate the needs of part -time students. DOUBLE MAJORS FO R UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS Bastyr University will allow students to complete two majors, provided a student is in good standing at the time he/she wishes to declare the second major. Students may start attending courses required for the second major in their first quarter of attendance. Students must submit the declaration of double major form to the registrar's office at the time the major is declared. The beginning of winter quarter of the junior year is the earliest time that a double major can be declared . There are no predetermined schedules for the double majors, since students enter Bastyr with different courses and prerequisites. It is the student's responsibility to create appropriate schedules for double major combinations. Students are advised to me et regularly with the undergraduate advisor in the registrar's office for assistance in tracking the progress of the two majors. Declaring a double major will increase the amount of time it takes to graduate. The minimum amount of time to complete any dou ble major is three years. If the required courses for any quarter exceed the limit on student credit loads (20 credits) as outlined in Policy #97 -C6 in the Bastyr University Academic Policy and Procedures Manual , the student is required to obtain the signa ture of the academic chairs of both majors. Students must complete the courses listed for each major in their catalog of entry. Students are not required to make up credits in the case of course duplication/comparability between majors. When elective requi rements have defined parameters, those electives must be completed, otherwise, additional elective credits are not required for double majors.

Knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine diagnostic strategies and their application to individual cases. b. Skill in the traditional methods of assessment of patients including interview ing, palpation and observation. c. Competence in selecting the appropriate treatment modalities and plans for a patient utilizing acupuncture, tui na, Chinese h erbs (relevant to the MSAOM) and lifestyle counseling. d. Skill in the application of acupunctur e techniques in an appropriate and safe fashion for each patient. 2) Able to integrate Eastern and Western paradigms of medicine for the purposes of informing the practice of traditional Chin ese medicine, communicating with other health care professionals and patients, and making appropriate medical referrals when necessary. 3) Professional in their approach to setting up and maintaining a private practice, collaborating with other health care prof essionals, working in an integrated health care setting and providing leadership within the acupuncture and Oriental medicine field. 4) Capable of accessing research information and critically assessing the value of published clinical research in the field. 5) Able to provide health prevention measures based on tra ditional Chinese medicine theory (such as tai chi, qigong, and therapeutic nutrition) to support the well being of their patients and themselves. 6) Qualified to pass national and state acupuncture and/or herbal exams. RECOGNITION AND LICENSURE OF ACUPUNC TURE AND ORIENTAL MEDICINE The Master of Science in Acupuncture (MSA), the Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (MSAOM) and the Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (DAOM) degree programs at Bastyr University are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM), 7501 Greenway Center Dr., Suite 760, Greenbelt, MD 20770, 301.313.0855. ACAOM is not currently recognized by the U.S. Department of Education with respect to doctoral programs in the f ield. However, Bastyr is accredited by the Northwest Commission for Colleges and Universities, 425.558.4224, and thus all degree offerings are accredited and DAOM students are eligible for Title IV funds. The Master of Science programs are approved by the Washington State Department of Health. Graduates of Bastyr University's MSA and MSAOM programs are eligible to apply for licensure in acupuncture in Washington state, as well as in most other states offering similar licensure. Applications for licensing i n Washington can be obtained by contacting the Washington State Department of Health, Professional Licensing - Acupuncture, P.O. Box 47868, Olympia, WA 98504 -7868, 360.236.4700. Applications for licensing in California can be obtained by contacting the Dep artment of Consumer Affairs, Acupuncture Board, 444 N. Third Street, Suite 260, Sacramento, CA 95814, 916.445.3021. Currently, acupuncture is recognized in 44 states and the District of Columbia. The actual requirements for licensure can vary from state to state, with the majority of states requiring the successful completion of the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) exam. If a student is interested in licensure in a state other than Washington or California, it is imperative for the student to know the licensing requirements of that particular state in order to ensure that there are no outstanding academic requirements at the time of graduation. Academic advising is available to help students who may have additi onal requirements to meet.

Bastyr Center is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary clinic providing quality training for students in all of the University's progra ms. Within the acupuncture and Oriental medicine clinic, students receive clinical training in acupuncture and Chinese herbs. In addition to training at the University clinic, students have the opportunity to train at several community medical sites that p rovide clinical experience in working with diverse populations. The clinical training program begins in the first year and is comprised of three observation shifts, one preceptorship and either 14 (MSA) or 16 (MSAOM) internship shifts. The three observatio n shifts can be performed in any of the five quarters preceding intern status. All observation hours, shifts and interim observation hours must be completed prior to starting as an intern. Internship shifts start in spring of the second year and continue t hroughout the program. The preceptorship shift may be performed in either the observation or internship phase of training. A minimum of one observation shift must be completed in order to do a preceptorship. Students in the MSAOM program or the CCHM progra m also take eight Chinese herbal shifts and two Chinese herbal dispensary shifts in the latter portion of their program. On a space available basis, students are welcome to take additional clinic shifts for elective credit. However, elective and elective a udit shifts cannot be used to make up missing hours in core shifts due to prior or future absences. Admission as an intern to the AOM student training clinic at Bastyr Center for Natural Health is based on: 1) good academic standing, 2) completion of a bac helor's degree or being enrolled in or graduated from an acupuncture master's program, 3) completion of the required prerequisite curriculum, 4) successful passage of the clinic entry written and practical exam, 5) current CPR for health care provider cert ification, and 6) certification in Clean Needle Technique (CNT). Please be aware that the opportunity to intern at one of the external clinics offered through Bastyr University is contingent on the student's ability to provide documentation of a vaccinatio n history. If this documentation is unavailable or out of date, students will need to update their vaccines at either local health centers or through their personal physicians. The community clinic rotations are outstanding clinical experiences in working with underserved and special patient populations, including developing skills working via medical translators. Students who are unable to provide vaccine documentation will not be eligible for this rotation and clinical training may be restricted to the B astyr student clinic. CHINA INTERNSHIPS Students in good academic standing are encouraged to apply for advanced studies in China. Students receive eight (8) clinical internship credits at Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine or Shanghai Univ ersity of Traditional Chinese Medicine, upon successful completion of the China program. Permission to attend is at the discretion of the School of AOM and depends on a number of additional factors, such as interpersonal skills, maturity and depth of clini cal skills. For an application, see the AOM clinic website under MyBU > clinic information . Students who plan to study in China are required to take the one -credit elective OM6820 Clinic Entry for China in summer quarter of their third year, just preceding their China internship. SUMMER MASSAGE INTENSIVE Bastyr University and the Bellevue Massage School Center for Healing Arts offer a summer massage training program that allows students to apply coursework taken at Bastyr University toward the Washington s tate requirements for massage licensure. This course cannot be audited. This program of study is an excellent future practice builder. The schedule for this training works particularly well for MSA students. Students interested in further information may m eet with their academic advisor in the registrar's office to discuss the program availability and the course prerequisites. BASIC SCIENCES CURRICULUM WITHIN ACUPUNCTURE AND ORIENTAL MEDICINE Basic science courses within acupuncture and Oriental medicine include Anatomy and Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Microbiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. These courses serve as a foundation for an understanding of the human body and provide students with the necessary skills and competency to pursue coursework in t he AOM program.

ACUPUNCTURE AND ORIENTAL MEDICINE DOCTORAL PROGRAM MISSION STATEMENT The mission of the Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine de gree program at Bastyr University is to train qualified practitioners in an integrated clinical approach to oncology and advanced pain management. This is accomplished through: 1) rigorous training in advanced concepts of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and biomedical theory and 2) an emphasis on training practitioners to be able to work in collaborative clinical settings. The program is committed to producing graduates who are prepared for lifelong learning in the field. EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES Graduate s of the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine's clinical doctoral program will have the skills to: 1) Develop an advanced TCM diagnosis and treatment plan including acupuncture, herbs, TCM nutrition, exercise and home self -care plans for oncology pa tients and patients with chronic pain, compatible with patients' levels of health and mobility. 2) Demonstrate an understanding of the clinical and biochemical rationale for various allopathic oncology and pain treatment protocols. 3) Discuss treatment pla nning issues as part of an integrated medical team with other health care providers or as part of a supervisory team working with master's program AOM students. 4) Demonstrate appropriate professional behaviors at all times with patients at various stages of illness. 5) Conduct research that demonstrates knowledge and skills in the areas of designing/critiquing approaches to scholarly inquiry utilizing qualitative and/or quantitative methods. The AOM clinical doctorate is focused on training students in can cer care and advanced pain management and treatment with an emphasis on training in integrated clinical settings. Students develop skills in clinical research and teaching with an in -depth focus on a medical specialty. Courses include advanced Chinese medi cal classics, advanced acupuncture techniques, Chinese herbs and therapeutics classes. Basic science classes focus on oncology and pain conditions pertaining to pathology and pharmacology. The curriculum also includes nutrition, grand rounds and counseling courses. A capstone research project is required. The degree title is \"DAOM,\" Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. At the present time, there is no change in scope of practice for DAOM graduates. Students would choose to pursue this training if th ey are 1) interested in a doctoral degree in traditional Chinese medicine, 2) interested in oncology and management of advanced pain conditions and /or 3) interested in learning to conduct clinical research. This is a clinical doctoral degree, not a PhD pr ogram. CLINICAL COMPONENT The DAOM program emphasizes clinical training in integrated care settings, with rotations at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, Seattle, Washington; Providence Regional Medical Center, Everett, Washington; and Skagit Valley Hospi tal Regional Cancer Care Center, Mount Vernon, Washington. In their final quarter of study, DAOM students travel to China to intern at Chengdu and Shanghai Universities of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Students take a one -credit elective course, Clinic Ent ry for China, in spring quarter of their second year in preparation for the China internships. There are additional expenses associated with the China internship other than tuition, including travel, lodging and living expenses, and laboratory fees assesse d by institutions in China. With planning, these expenses can be covered by financial aid. Bastyr University holds fundraising events to support China studies. DAOM students may choose to participate in these fundraising events to help defray travel expens es in China. See the DAOM program director for more details. CAPSTONE PROJECT As part of the program of study, DAOM students must complete a capstone research project. Capstone projects may take a variety of formats, including clinical or basic research, surveys, translation, systematic review or theoretical analysis. Students are expected to conduct and complete their capstone project, including final acceptance of their capstone paper, by the time all other program requirements are completed. If addition al time is needed for completion and all other program requirements are finished, then students will be assessed an additional fee (equal to 1 credit of tuition) on a quarter by quarter basis until completion. Please see OM8199 Capstone Continuation and/or the Capstone Project Handbook for further details. PREREQUISITES Minimum prerequisites for the doctor of acupuncture and Oriental medicine degree are a master's degree in acupuncture or acupuncture and Oriental medicine or a certificate of acupuncture wi th 10 years of documented clinical experience. Applicants with AOM master's degrees must have graduated from an ACAOM -candidate or -accredited program. If doctoral applicants completed their previous AOM training through a certificate program, then at a minimum, they are required to obtain 90 quarter credits (60 semester credits) of undergraduate college work. If applicants do not have a Chinese herb background, then they must complete the Certificate in Chinese Herbal Medicine as a prerequisite. The CCHM can be considered as a corequisite if the didactic portion of the certificate has been completed prior to matriculation in the doctoral program. Applicants to the doctoral program who need to complete undergraduate hours must include the following didactic coursework: BASIC PROFICIENCY AND SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS English literature or composition ............ 9 quarter credits Intermediate algebra ................................ ........... 1 course1 General psychology ................................ . 3 quarter credits General chemistry (health science major level) ............... 4 quarter credits2 1Intermediat e algebra is not college level math, and the credits will not be included in the 90 undergraduate credit total required. 2Survey level class that covers inorganic chemistry and includes a lab component. Intended for students in allied health major s. GENER AL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS Natural sciences and mathematics ......... 12 quarter credits Arts and humanities ............................... 15 quarter credits Social sciences ................................ ....... 15 quarter credits Speech communication or public speaking ................................ ... 3 quarter credits Electives ................................ ............... 25 quarter credits1 1 The number of elective credits may vary depending upon the exact number of quarter credits earned in the other prerequisite categories. Tot al prerequisite credits must equal at least 90 quarter credits. Doctoral applicants must have a background in the basic sciences that is comparable to what Bastyr University requires at the master's level. Applicants may be required to take competency exams in the basic sciences in order to determine whether further remediation is required. This would potentially include exams in an atomy and physiology, surface anatomy, biochemistry, Western pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, and Western clinical sciences. If remediation is required, then a student must complete the prerequisites associated with that course, which may include par t or all of the following: Intermediate algebra ................................ ............ 1 course General chemistry (health science major level) . 1 course1 General biology (with lab) ................................ .. 1 course General psychology ................................ ............. 1 course Note: The minimum grade for the above prerequisites is a C. The minimum GPA for any past college -level education is a 2.25. 1Survey level class that covers inorganic chemistry, includes a lab component and is intended for students in allied health ma jors. Doctoral applicants who are licensed acupuncturists but do not hold a mast er's degree in AOM will also be evaluated for competency with the master's level AOM curriculum. An applicant's bachelor's degree will be assessed for meeting all general education requirements. Challenge exams covering material in upper level AOM courses may be required in order to assess whether further remediation is required. It is entirely possible that some returning practitioners who do not have a master's degree in AOM will need to take a year or more to complete the master's level curriculum before advancing to the doctoral level curriculum. The goal of the admissions process is to provide a supportive and respectful atmosphere for returning practitioners while maintaining rigorous academic standards. The curriculum table that follows lists the ten tative schedule of courses each quarter. Next to each course are the number of credits per course (Crdt.), the lecture hours each week (Lec.), the lab/clinic hours each week (L/C) and the total contact ho urs for the course over the entire quarter (Tot). Th is table reflects a full -time course of study. A part -time option is also available. DOCTOR OF ACUPUNCTURE AND ORIENTAL MEDICINE (DAOM) 2009 -2010 YEAR I Qtr. Cat. No. Course Title Crdt. Lec.

BACHELOR OF SCIENCE WITH A MAJOR IN NUTRITION WITH DIDACTIC PROGRAM IN DIETETICS (BSN/DPD) The Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) is a term used by the American Dietetic Association (ADA) to describe a program that is accredited by the Commission of Accreditation of Dietetics (CADE), which meets academic competencies. Currently, in th e United States, the registered dietitian (RD) is the only professional credential in nutrition recognized by all 50 states and with reciprocity in five countries. Verified completion of the DPD and a minimum of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accred ited institution enable a student to apply for a dietetic internship, to write the registration examination to become a RD after completing the Dietetic Internship and to become a licensed RD after successfully passing the RD examination. The mission of th e program is to graduate students who will promote nutrition and well -being through food that sustains the individual, the community and the earth. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND PREREQUISITES Application for admission to the BSN/DPD at Bastyr University is s eparate from application to the degree programs. BSN/DPD application packets can be requested from the Bastyr University Office of Admissions at the beginning of spring quarter between the junior and senior year. Acceptance requires the following prerequis ites in addition to those for the BS with a Major in Nutrition: public speaking (if general or speech communication, then must include public speaking practice) and current enrollment at Bastyr University. To be eligible for acceptance into the BSN/DPD, st udents must have completed their junior year and must meet all prerequisites for the BSN completion degree. To be competitive for admission into the BSN/DPD, the following GPAs are required (cumulative from all colleges and universities attended): Cumulati ve overall GPA - total of all courses 3.00 Cumulative science GPA - biology, organic chemistry, anatomy and physiology, and biochemistry courses only 3.00 Cumulative nutrition GPA - all nutrition courses 3.00 A minimum of 150 hours of volunteer and/or p aid work experience is required prior to being admitted to the BSN/DPD. Documentation of hours with signature of sponsor is required. Specific information and forms for documenting these experiences is available from the admissions department. The followi ng is a breakdown of the volunteer and/or paid work hours required for admission: Minimum of 50 hours clinical nutrition (in -patient hospital and/or long -term care) Minimum of 50 hours food service management Minimum of 50 hours community nutrition GRAD UATION REQUIREMENTS In their final year, it is recommended that BSN/DPD students meet with the DPD director for academic advising each quarter prior to registration to discuss academic progress and as part of the dietetic internship application process. A total of 300 hours of volunteer and/or paid work experience is required to graduate from the BSN/DPD (inclusive of the 150 hours obtained prior to admission to the program). The following is a breakdown of those hours: Total of 100 hours clinical nutrition (in-patient and/or long -term care direct patient contact) Total of 100 hours food service management Total of 100 hours community nutrition Leadership by participation in the Bastyr University Student Nutrition Association (SNA) and becoming a student me mber of the American Dietetic Association (ADA) are recommended. A signed verification statement is required to enable students to be eligible for entry into an accredited dietetic internship. In order to receive a signed verification statement, 300 volun teer hours and/or paid hours must first be completed, signed, and verified by the DPD director. Second, students must pass the DPD exit exam with a passing grade of 70 percent. Third, students must complete all the required coursework with a graduating cumulative GPA of 3.0. Completion of the DPD program does not guarantee acceptance into a dietetic internship.

DOCTOR OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE Naturopathic medicine is a distinct profession of primary health care, emphasizing prevention, treatment and the promotion of optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and modalities which encourage the self- healing process, the vis medicatrix naturae . The U.S. Department of Labor defines the naturopathic physician as one who \"diagnoses, treats and cares for patients, using a system of practice that bases its treatment of all physiological functions and abnormal conditions on natural laws governing the body, utilizes physiological, psychological and mechanical methods, such as air, water, heat, earth, phytotherapy (treatment by use of plants), electrotherapy, physiotherapy, minor or orificial surgery, me chanotherapy, naturopathic corrections and manipulation, and all natural methods or modalities, together with natural medicines, natural processed foods, herbs, and natural remedies. Excludes major surgery, therapeutic use of x -ray and radium, and use of d rugs, except those assimilable substances containing elements or compounds which are compounds of body tissues and are physiologically compatible to body processes for maintenance of life.\" Most naturopathic physicians provide natural medicine primary care through office -based, private practice. Many receive additional training in disciplines or modalities such as midwifery and acupuncture and Oriental medicine. Naturopathic diagnosis and therapeutics are supported by scientific research drawn from peer -reviewed journals from many disciplines, including naturopathic medicine, conventional medicine, European complementary medicine, clinical nutrition, phytotherapy, pharmacognosy, homeopathy, psychology and spirituality. Information technology and new concept s in clinical outcomes assessment are particularly well -suited to evaluating the effectiveness of naturopathic treatment protocols and are being used in research, both at naturopathic medical schools and in the offices of practicing physicians. Clinical re search into natural therapies has become an increasingly important focus for naturopathic physicians. A NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE GRADUATE OF BASTYR UNIVERSITY 'S SCHOOL OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE WILL: Be an empowered, strong practitioner. Be trained to the standards of a primary care physician as accepted by the profession. Be a provider of excellent and consistent, quality patient care. Practice the principles of naturopathic medicine. Be an integrated, active participant in the community. PRINCIPLE S OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE The Healing Power of Nature ( Vis Medicatrix Naturae ) Identify and Treat the Do No Doctor as Teacher ( Docere ) Treat the Whole Person Prevention Wellness SCOPE OF PRACTICE Natur opathic medicine is defined by principles rather than by methods or modalities. Diagnostic and therapeutic methods are diverse. The current scope of practice for a naturopathic physician covers the general practice of naturopathic medicine, as a primary ca re physician. This scope of practice includes, but is not limited to, the following diagnostic and therapeutic modalities: nutritional science, natural hygiene, botanical medicine, naturopathic physical medicine, homeopathy, counseling, spirituality, minor office procedures and methods of laboratory and clinical diagnosis. The scope of practice is defined by state or provincial statute. The curriculum at Bastyr University matches the requirements listed by the Washington State Department of Health. Students have the responsibility to be informed on licensure and scope of practice in the legal jurisdiction in which they choose to practice. LEGAL STATUS OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE Naturopathic physicians are licensed as health care providers in Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Legal provisions allow the practice of naturopathic medic ine in several other states. Efforts to gain licensure elsewhere are currently underway. Thirty -three states and territories in the United States have professional associations for naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic physicians are also recognized in Briti sh Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Saskatchewan. NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS All states and provinces with licensure laws require a resident course of at least four years and 4,100 hours of study from a college or University recognized by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME).

REQUIRED ABILITIES /SKILLS FOR NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE PROGRAM ADMISSION Bastyr University is committed to providing equal opportunities for differently abled persons. The following policy has been adapted from the American Association of Medical Colleges guidelines to ensure that prospective students have the physical and mental capacities to perform the required duties of a naturopathic physician. A candidate for the naturopathic medicine degree must be able to demonstrate appropriate observational and communication skills, motor function, intellectual -conceptual, integrative and quantitative abilities, and behavioral and social maturity. Technological compensation can be made for some disabilities in certain of these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selectio n and observation. Observation: The candidate must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to microbiologic cultures and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and somatic sensation. These are enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. Com munication: A candidate must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity, and posture, and perceive nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor: Candidates shou ld have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to do basic laboratory tests (urinalysis, CBC, etc.), re -position a patient, carry out d iagnostic and therapeutic procedures and read ECGs and x-rays. A candidate should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, the suturing of simple wounds, and the performance of simple obstetrical maneuvers. Such actions requ ire coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Intellectual -Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, an alysis and synthesis. Problem solving, a critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three -dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationship s of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes: A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of her/his intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing work loads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to c hanging environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all persona l qualities that are assessed during the admissions and educational processes. ADMISSIONS CRITERIA The admissions committee of the naturopathic medicine program determines the processes and procedures that guide the selection of candidates for the naturop athic program. The committee reviews undergraduate and graduate (if applicable) academic records and performance in the required prerequisite courses. The personal statement, references, resumes and in person interviews are also evaluated for evidence of t he abilities and skills required of naturopathic physicians. The interview also explores the candidate's awareness of the practice of naturopathic medicine. Bastyr University's naturopathic medicine program is academically challenging. While no minimum GPA is specified, the mean GPA for entering students in the last five years has exceeded 3.3. INTERVIEWS Qualified applicants who submit complete applications and meet the prerequisites may be invited to interview. Applicants are expected to interview at the University's campus in Kenmore, Washington. A limited number of exceptions are made to accommodate special circumstances. TRANSFER STUDENTS Bastyr University accepts transfer students from naturopathic, medical, osteopathic and chiropractic schools and other accredited professional programs on a space -available basis. For transfer consideration, credits must be earned from an institution accredited by a regional accrediting agency or from an institution accredited by the CNME. Transfer students are consid ered for admission in accordance with the following general guidelines: Applicants must meet the same entrance requirements as candidates for the first -year class. Applicants who wish to transfer credits from prior coursework must demonstrate satisfact ory completion of courses that are equivalent in content and quality to courses given at the University. Satisfactory completion equals a grade of achieved competency, a B or above, or a 3.0 or above. Applicants must provide an official transcript from t he college or program from which the transfer is being requested, demonstrating that they are leaving in good academic standing and should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorou gh evaluation. Transfer applicants must submit a $75 transfer evaluation fee. ADVANCED STANDING STATUS BASED ON PRIOR MEDICAL EDUCATION Applicants who have completed professional programs may be considered for advanced standing status. Those applicants who graduated from accredited chiropractic, medical or osteopathic colleges may be eligible for advanced standing in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program. All advanced standing students must complete at least two -thirds of the program and do all of their clinical work at Bastyr University. T hey are eligible for a maximum of 103 credits toward advanced standing. In those instances where the maximum number of advanced standing transfer credits is granted, it will take a minimum of three years (11 quarters) to complete the program. Placement dep ends upon the amount of coursework completed in the original program, similarity of the course content and credits, age of the courses and performance in these courses. Course waivers and/or credit transfers are considered only for those courses in which a pplicants demonstrate a grade of achieved competence, a B or above, or a 3.0 or above. Advanced standing applicants must complete all of the course and credit requirements in effect at the time of their enrollment in the Bastyr University naturopathic medi cine program. Advanced standing is determined on a case by case basis and depends on the type of degree program completed, the courses taken and the number of years in practice. Applicants who are eligible for advanced standing must submit a $75 advanced s tanding evaluation fee. Applicants transferring from another naturopathic school are not required to pay the advanced standing evaluation fee. Applicants must submit a catalog of course descriptions for the years they attended their professional program and should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorough evaluation. Participation in an intensive may be required for students entering with advanced standing status. In addition, participation in one or more problem -based practica ma y be required to gauge and increase skill level. If an advanced standing student is found to be deficient in some areas of study, he/she may be required to complete additional courses. For more information on advanced standing status admission policies and procedures, contact the admissions office. BASIC SCIENCES CURRICULUM WITHIN NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE Basic science courses within the naturopathic medicine program emphasize anatomy, physiology and biochemistry as the foundation for further basic sciences and all clinical courses. Further courses include Histology, Pathology, Pharmacology, Immunology, Infectious Diseases, Embryology, Neuroscience and Research Design. The basic sciences faculty encourages and expects students to advance beyond the simple lea rning of scientific facts and to integrate systematically the information from basic science disciplines into a unified model of human organization and function. This educational scheme requires students to assume an active role in the learning process and encourages them to adopt this inquisitive behavior for a lifetime. Problem solving, clinical cases and examples are an integral part of the basic science curriculum. This educational process is an expression of Bastyr University's basic philosophy of a ho listic approach to human behavior, health and therapeutics. The basic sciences faculty encourages students to become totally absorbed in an integrated approach to learning and understanding. Instructors are readily available to facilitate this process on a n individual basis. The department also offers science courses that satisfy prerequisite requirements, including courses in General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry and Biophysics. COUNSELING AND HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY CURRICULUM WITHIN NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE AND NATUROPATHIC MIDWIFERY The counseling and health psychology curriculum serves naturopathic medical students in understanding and effecting change in the emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensions of human functioning. The naturopathic medicine program in cludes five core counseling and health psychology courses. These courses are designed to build the following competencies: Study of the nature and process of healing. Development of therapeutic counselor characteristics and communication skills. Deve lopment of comfort in the role of counseling physician and a sense of counseling style and skills. Ability to select and implement holistic counseling interventions and strategies. Ability to assess and stimulate psychological wellness. Ability to un derstand and utilize the body/mind/spirit interaction in the healing process. Ability to assess psychological functioning and make clinical judgments regarding the appropriateness of treating individuals in naturopathic practice. Ability to make approp riate psychological referrals. Naturopathic principles and cross -cultural perspectives are woven throughout all counseling and health psychology courses in the naturopathic medicine program. The following core courses are required of all naturopathic medic ine students: PS6305: Naturopathic Counseling 1 - 3 credits PS6306: Naturopathic Counseling 2 - 3 credits PS7200: Psychological Assessment - 2 credits PS7203: Addictions and Disorders - 2 credits PS7315: Naturopathic Counseling 3 - 2 credits The following core elective is required for students in the naturopathic midwifery certificate program and is strongly recommended for all naturopathic medicine students: PS6303: Sexuality and Sex Therapy - 2 credits For additional counseling and health psyc hology courses available as electives to matriculated students, please see the course listings in this catalog or the current quarterly schedule of classes. Departments Within the Naturopathic Medicine Program BOTANICAL MEDICINE (For Department of Botani cal Medicine Mission and Vision, see page 64.) Botanical medicine is a core modality for naturopathic physicians to use in optimizing the health and well -being of their patients. Medicinal plants have been used as food and medicine by all peoples on all co ntinents. The importance of plants to humans has been recorded in cave paintings 60,000 years old. A contemporary renaissance in herbal medicine weds traditional use and wisdom with modern analytical methodologies for optimal medical applications for today . Empirical knowledge of plant therapeutics is based on Western and holistic thought rather than reductionistic paradigms and is linked with contemporary scientific knowledge. The core curriculum in botanical medicine for naturopathic medical students cove rs fundamental plant identification and nomenclature, pharmacognosy, therapeutic actions, extraction principles, dosage considerations, contraindications, toxicology, herb -drug interactions, clinical applications and treatment regimens. Clinical therapeuti cs draw from traditional uses, naturopathic formulae and use, and from international scientific and clinical research, as well as advances in phytotherapy. Several of the materia medica courses are linked with a laboratory experience in the botanical medic ine lab on campus. Completion of the required curriculum, along with the required clinical experience, prepares the student for effective and safe clinical utilization of preventive and therapeutic botanicals. A variety of botanical medicine elective and s pecial topic courses are offered to students in the naturopathic medicine program and other programs, along with independent study options. The Bastyr garden is managed by the botanical medicine department, with support from the University and donations. I t is maintained primarily by a staff garden supervisor and work -study students. The botanical medicine department continues to build an herbarium, although the vast University of Washington herbarium is used as one of Bastyr's teaching venues. The departme nt supports a botanical medicine lab to expand class experience and provide a space for students to continue exploring their work and passion for herbs. HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE Homeopathic medicine is a broad therapeutic modality that is integral to naturopa thic medicine. Homeopathy is based on the law of similars. This principle states that a substance that is capable of producing symptoms of disease in a healthy person can cure an ill patient presenting a similar pattern of disease symptoms. Homeopathic med icines stimulate a person's inherent defense mechanism. The entire range of mental, emotional and physical symptoms is considered with each patient. A single medicine is then chosen that addresses the complex pattern of the patient, while emphasizing the u niqueness of the individual. The homeopathic curriculum at Bastyr University includes the basic principles and philosophy of homeopathy, materia medica of commonly used homeopathic medicines, use of the homeopathic repertory, taking a homeopathic case, hom eopathic case analysis and practical therapeutics for common medical situations. All naturopathic students are required to take three courses in homeopathy, HO6300, HO6301, and HO6302 (Homeopathy 1 -3). There are three additional elective courses, HO9301, H O9302, and HO9303 (Homeopathy 4-6), which explore, in more depth, the areas of homeopathic philosophy, materia medica, case analysis and management, and homeopathic therapeutics. Naturopathic students, upon successful completion of Homeopathy 1-3, may regi ster for shifts in the Homeopathy Specialty Clinic at Bastyr Center for Natural Health. Students registered for a homeopathy shift must register concurrently for Homeopathy Grand Rounds. PHYSICAL MEDICINE Physical medicine is an integral part of naturopa thic medicine. It includes various modalities such as hydrotherapy, osseous and soft tissue manipulation, sports medicine and therapeutic exercise. The course of study and clinical training in physical medicine enable students to develop a solid foundation for entry into the practice of naturopathic medicine. The curriculum offers sufficient hours in manipulation to satisfy the state of Washington's licensing requirement as a naturopathic physician. The physical medicine curriculum begins by teaching studen ts the art of touch and palpation, introduction to basic Swedish massage techniques and soft tissue manipulation, and then progresses to osseous manipulation. SUMMER MASSAGE INTENSIVE Bastyr University and Bellevue Massage School Center for Healing Arts o ffer students a summer massage training program that allows them to apply coursework taken at Bastyr University toward the Washington state requirements for massage licensure. This course cannot be audited. Students interested in further information may me et with their academic advisor in the registrar's office or with their department's program supervisor to discuss the program availability and the course prerequisites. NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE CLINIC ENTRANCE PREREQUISITES To be eligible to enter the clini c, students must have completed all courses listed for the first and second years of the four -year track or all courses listed for the first, second and third years of the five -year track, Option A. Students must have completed TB screening and have receiv ed or signed a waiver for hepatitis B immunization. Students must have a current CPR card. Washington state law also requires all students to submit to a criminal background check before being allowed entry into clinical experiences. Please be aware that t he opportunity to intern at one of the external clinics offered through Bastyr University is contingent on the student's ability to provide documentation of a vaccination history. The community clinic rotations are outstanding clinical experiences in wor king with underserved and special patient populations including developing skills working with medical translators. Students who are unable to provide vaccine documentation will not be eligible for this rotation and clinical training may be restricted to the Bastyr student clinic. CLINIC REQUIREMENTS Registration in eight consecutive quarters is required to complete the clinic requirements. Students are expected to begin their clinical training during the summer following the completion of their preclinic al courses. Students will be registered for six shifts during their first year (four quarters) in clinic. After the completion of six shifts (Patient Care and Physical Medicine), students become primary clinicians. Students must be enrolled in at least one Patient Care shift each quarter throughout their clinical training. Clinic faculty are currently in the process of developing Objective Skills Clinical Exams (OSCE). These exams are designed to evaluate students' clinical skills and clinical decision maki ng in a standardized manner. Students may be required to participate in an OSCE during each year of their clinical training. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS The curriculum of the naturopathic medicine program requires completion of 310.5 credits for graduation. There are 249.5 core course credits, 14 elective credits and 47 clinic credits. Students must achieve competency (grade of AC) in all 310.5 credits required in the curriculum. Students must complete all required clinical competencies in order to graduate. S tudents must complete at least two -thirds of their credits in residence at Bastyr University. ELECTIVES Students in the naturopathic medicine program are required to complete 14 elective credits (included in the 310.5 credit totals) during their course of study. Up to five of these credits may be satisfied by independent study. It is recommended that elective credits be spread out over the length of the student's program. Courses designated as elective and special topics may fulfill this 14 -credit requirem ent, as well as additional clinic shifts during the student's clinical training. In general, a maximum of nine elective credits from any one department may be used to satisfy the ND elective requirement. A student may take elective credits from any program /department. NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE PROGRAM TRACKS Students who are accepted into the program and decide not to complete the program in four years must choose one of the following approved options: Five-Year Track -Option A. Five-Year Track -Option B. Combined Five -Year Track -Option A and B (for a total of 6 years). These are the only program track options. Bastyr offers no part -time status. As long as a student remains on an approved program track, there will be no course scheduling conflicts. Students choosing a track other than the four -year program must complete, through the registrar's office, the appropriate paperwork. Students must remain on track in order to graduate on time. Students may not register off track or register ahead of track without approval from the dean's office. For additional information regarding combining naturopathic medicine with acupuncture and Oriental medicine, please contact the admissions office. The curriculum tables that follow list the tentative schedule of courses ea ch quarter.

The vision of the naturopathic midwifery program is: To preserve nat uropathic childbirth within the scope of naturopathic medical practice and to promote naturopathic midwifery nationwide. To improve the quality of care provided to childbearing women and their families. To preserve the normalcy of childbearing and prom ote natural childbirth. Graduates are uniquely qualified among naturopathic physicians and among midwives. As comprehensive naturopathic family physicians, they enjoy an extended scope of practice in the provision of care to the birthing woman and her fami ly. In their role as naturopathic midwives, they augment the midwives' model of care with the naturopathic principles of practice and exceed the midwifery scope of practice by providing ongoing pediatric, gynecological and family care. The depth and breadt h of naturopathic medicine is wholly embodied in the naturopathic doctor specializing in maternity care. Upon completion of our program the graduate will be able to: Implement an integrated, comprehensive knowledge and skill base to competently provide i ndependent, evidenced -based, naturopathic midwifery care according to the midwives Alliance of North America (MANA) core competencies, MANA standards and qualifications for the art and practice of midwifery as well as AANP naturopathic principles and code of ethics, within prescribed legal boundaries. Practice interdependently with other members of the health care team. Advocate for the client as an integral member of the health care team with distinct rights and responsibilities, facilitating empower ment and promoting health. Provide culturally sensitive care integrating knowledge and wisdom about the biophysical, psychosocial, spiritual aspects of childbearing according to MANA statement on values and ethics. Participate in formal and informal q uality assurance mechanisms and pursue lifelong learning. This certificate adds to the Bastyr naturopathic medicine program 71.5 additional classroom and lab credits, which includes approximately 1,350 clinical hours. At least one year of clinical training is required. These additional requirements may be done concurrently with, or after finishing, a CNME -accredited program in naturopathic medicine. (If taken after completing a naturopathic medicine degree, the program will take one to two years to complete .) The program is open to graduates of any naturopathic medical program that is accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). The program is fully accredited by the federally approved Midwifery Education Accreditation Council. The na turopathic midwifery program fulfills the MANA core competencies for midwifery practice and exceeds minimum clinical standards set by both the American College of Nurse Midwives and the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM). Graduates are eligible for licensure as midwives in the state of Washington and may be able to demonstrate eligibility in other states that license midwives. Graduates may also sit for the ACNO (American College of Naturopathic Obstetricians) specialty licensure exam in states that include natural childbirth within the scope of the naturopathic physician. In addition, graduates are eligible to sit for the NARM certified professional midwife (CPM) exam. Note: New students are no longer being enrolled in the Naturopathic Midwifery pro gram. DIDACTIC TRAINING The naturopathic midwifery program is not a freestanding curriculum. It is interwoven with the naturopathic medicine curriculum. It adds approximately one year to the naturopathic medicine program when taken concurrently. Students planning to complete the midwifery program are advised to choose the 5B naturopathic medicine curriculum track in order to allow for the additional clinical and classroom hours required. NOTE: Students not enrolled in the 5B track will not be placed in hi gh volume, local internship sites. Many courses in the naturopathic medicine program are prerequisites for the naturopathic midwifery program. Students enrolled in the naturopathic midwifery program may apply nine credits of required midwifery coursework t oward the 15 elective credits required in the naturopathic medicine program. Students entering the naturopathic midwifery program have no requirement for midwifery electives; however, students are strongly encouraged to take electives offered by the naturo pathic midwifery department and those electives offered by other departments that are applicable to family, maternal, infant and pediatric care. Students are assessed by classroom faculty and clinical faculty for proficiency in course -specific and clinical competencies as well as the Bastyr global competencies. (See catalog introduction.) CLINICAL TRAINING The naturopathic midwifery program requires extensive supervised clinical experience, including the care of women and their babies throughout pregnancy and into the postpartum period. The addition of this program greatly deepens and broadens clinical expertise via at least 1,350 additional hours of supervised patient interactions, physical examinations, charting, lab procedures, etc. While enrolled in the academic program, students are required to manage 75 prenatal visits (20 must be the initial prenatal visit), 20 newborn visits, 50 postpartum visits, actively participate in at least 25 births and manage 50 births, all under the supervision of an approve d preceptor. (Students receive 100 percent supervision during all aspects of clinical training.) In order to enter a birth internship, students must be admitted into the naturopathic midwifery program and have successfully completed all basic science cours es and MW7320 Normal Maternity. Prior to managing births or performing any skills independently at births, students must have completed MW7303 Labor Complications. Of the 50 births managed, 15 must be with one preceptor and 15 must be births at home or in an out -of-hospital setting. To satisfy continuity of care requirements, at least four of these managements must be with women for whom the student has provided primary care during at least four prenatal visits, the birth, a newborn exam and one postpartum exam. In addition, the management of 20 newborn exams must be documented. Students are required to train in at least two different preceptor sites. Each of the 75 birth experiences counts as one -half credit, for a total of 37.5 credits. Advanced clinical standing status may be approved by the naturopathic midwifery department chair. All clinical experience is gained in internships secured by students with approved physicians or midwives practicing in the U.S. or abroad. Each student is responsible for arra nging his/her own internship with guidance from the naturopathic midwifery department. All preceptors must be practicing legally within their state or country and must be approved by the department chair. Approval can take as long as eight weeks for out -of- state sites. Advanced students may be placed in an overseas, high -volume birth site. These sites are hospital - based and require at least a one -month commitment. See the financial aid office for loan information. Students are required to obtain training i n neonatal resuscitation, adult CPR, a TB test, a Washington State Patrol background check, and must complete a criminal history disclosure form before beginning their internships. Information about times and locations of neonatal resuscitation workshops i s available through Seattle Children's Hospital. Students must keep resuscitation trainings current throughout the clinical training experience and are responsible for the costs incurred. Once placed in an internship, students are required to meet with th e naturopathic midwifery department chair each quarter to review evaluations and to register births. If students are interning at a distance, they must maintain timely contact with the chair each quarter by whatever means appropriate. Those admitted to the program who are not involved in internships are also expected to schedule and attend a quarterly advising session with the department chair. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS Students enrolled in the naturopathic midwifery program are required to complete the Bast yr University naturopathic medicine program or be a graduate of a CNME -accredited naturopathic college or program, and are required to complete 32 credits of specialized naturopathic midwifery courses, 2 credits of midwifery independent study, and 37.5 cre dits of birth practicum. A student shall be issued the Certificate in Naturopathic Midwifery when all the following requirements have been met: Receipt of the doctor of naturopathic medicine degree. Satisfactory completion of all naturopathic midwifery program courses. Compilation of approved clinical practice guidelines. Completion of all naturopathic midwifery program clinical requirements. Recommendation from the naturopathic midwifery department chair. Bastyr students who enter the program whi le enrolled in the naturopathic medicine program have three years from their ND graduation date to complete the naturopathic midwifery program. Those with an ND degree from Bastyr or any other CNME -accredited program have three years to complete the naturo pathic midwifery program. LICENSURE In most states that license naturopathic physicians to provide intrapartum care, practitioners must have graduated from a maternity care specialty program offered within a CNME -accredited naturopathic medicine program. In addition, they are required to pass the American College of Naturopathic Obstetricians (ACNO) exam. In states using the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) exam, our graduates are eligible to be licensed or registered as midwives or as certified professional midwives (CPMs). The curriculum table that follows lists the tentative schedule of courses each quarter. Next to each course are the number of credits per course (Crdt.), the lecture hours each week (Lec.) and the lab/clinic hours each week ( L/C).

NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE /ACUPUNCTURE AND ORIENTA L MEDICINE DUAL TRACK Students in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program who are academically in good standing have the opportunity to apply to the Master of Science in Acupuncture (MSA) or the Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Med icine (MSAOM) program in October of their second year of the four -year track. This requires a formal application to the acupuncture and Oriental medicine program through the admissions department, followed by a joint interview by both the AOM and ND school s. ND students who are considering applying to the School of AOM as their second program are strongly encouraged to be enrolled as four -year track students during their first two years of attendance. In essence, the dual track program requires that studen ts have successfully completed their pre -clinical ND training before they add a second degree program. Students who are accepted into the AOM program must switch their naturopathic program to the five -year track in order to carry a combined program load. S tudents with advanced medical training, e.g., DC, DO or MD, must successfully complete the first year of study in their original program before acceptance into dual status. Dual program applicants are able to utilize their basic science coursework in the n aturopathic program toward their MSA or MSAOM. Please note that some states require Chinese herbal training for acupuncture licensure. Please see the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine master's program description for complete information on degr ee and licensing requirements. DUAL TRACK ELECTIVE CREDITS Dual track students must complete 10 elective credits. Four of the elective credits must be from Oriental medicine or Chinese medicine and six credits from other disciplines. If a dual track stude nt has waived a required course from either program, core course credit from the opposite program cannot be used to cover the waiver. Use of core credits would result in a shortage of overall credits. The curriculum tables that follow list the tentative s chedule of courses each quarter. Next to each course are the number of credits per course (Crdt.), the lecture hours each week (Lec.), the lab/clinic hours each week (L/C) and the total contact ho urs for the course over the entire quarter (Tot). DOCTOR OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE /MASTER OF SCIENCE IN ACUPUNCTURE (MSA) OR ACUPUNCTURE AND ORIENTAL MEDICINE (MSAOM) 2009 -2010 Note: Since a naturopathic medicine student enters the dual program after completion of the 2nd year of the NM program, the curriculum that follows reflects the NM curriculum from the 2007/2008 catalog and the MSA/MSAOM curriculum from the 2009 -2010 catalog.

All students in the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program (ND), Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine program (DAOM), Mast er of Science in Acupuncture program (MSA), Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine program (MSAOM), Master of Nutrition program (MSN/CHP and MSN/DPD), Certificate in Chinese Herbal Medicine program (CCHM), and BS Didactic Program in Dieteti cs (BSN/DPD) receive clinical training at Bastyr Center for Natural Health - Team Care. The program dean/chair or their designate in conjunction with the clinic medical director oversees the clinical education and training of the students and works closely with each program's lead administrator. The clinical training in Team Care is modeled upon mentorship. The average faculty/student ratio is 1:6, which includes three primary clinicians/interns and three observing clinicians/interns. Each student pair is a ssigned to a room throughout the quarter. Each clinic shift begins with case preview during which the students present to the supervisor their preparations for the patients they will be seeing that day. During each patient visit, the supervisor spends time in the room with the student team and the patient. Also, during each visit, the supervisor and student team consult about the patient in consult rooms, reviewing the assessments and treatment recommendations. Each clinic shift concludes with case review w here all the students and supervisors meet jointly to discuss selected cases seen that day. Clinical course numbers and descriptions for each program's required and elective clinical offerings are found in the course description section of the catalog unde r the appropriate program heading. The narrative section of the catalog provides further information regarding clinical training, under each program and curriculum section. Students in each program receive a Bastyr Center for Natural Health Student Clinici an Handbook prior to entering clinic. This required manual serves as the student's clinic textbook and contains information on clinical education requirements, policies and procedures, learning objectives and clinical competencies. External clinical traini ng opportunities have been developed for each program, in order to provide a broader educational experience for students. At each external site, Bastyr faculty supervises the student clinicians. For a description of these sites, see Bastyr Center facilitie s listing on page 13 in this catalog. Students have a preceptorship requirement in which they are placed with a variety of licensed, practicing health care professionals in various practice settings. These placements provide students with valuable clinical experience. The combination of external training sites, the preceptor pool and the main clinic shifts assures tremendous diversity in each student's clinical experience. Bastyr Center for Natural Health has a well -established CNME -credentialed naturopath ic residency program, as well as a residency program in acupuncture and Oriental medicine. Currently, there are eight naturopathic residency positions and three AOM residency positions. These programs are highly competitive and attract graduates from other educational institutions as well as from Bastyr. The residency programs at Bastyr are closely supervised programs of mentorship. Each resident progresses from a purely observational role into an independent role over the course of the year. This progressi on is monitored and facilitated by a faculty mentor and by the program dean/chair or their designate. A second year of residency offers clinical supervision and continued skill development. All residents have multiple opportunities to do rotations in other local clinics (allopathic, naturopathic, acupuncture and Oriental medicine, etc.). The office of the director of graduate and community medicine is responsible for the administration, development and expansion of the naturopathic residency program. The Un iversity is committed to the goal of providing residency opportunities for every graduate.
