Spices and aromatic vegetables are used not only for their savor, fragrance, and appetizing effects but also for their preservative and therapeutic properties [ [1](#B1)]. Over the past decade, a significant shift in the scientific approach with food material has lead to an alternative therapy for enhancing the well being of an individual [ [2](#B2) [3](#B3)], as naturally obtained food stuff can be consumed safely. [2](#B2) [4](#B4) [5](#B5)]. A diet rich in vegetables (more than 440 g/day), fruits, and spices is able to prevent at least 20% of all cancers [ [6](#B6)]. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, approximately 15% of oropharyngeal cancers can be attributed to dietary deficiencies or imbalances [ [7](#B7)]. There is a strong influence of low intake of antioxidants and fibers on oral squamous cell carcinoma in USA, Asia, and Europe [ [7](#B7)]. Numerous studies revealed that they act as chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents [ [3](#B3)]. However there is insufficient knowledge about the preventive and therapeutic aspects of these neutraceuticals in oral health care. Thus, the aim of this paper is to summarize active constituents and healing attributes of some routinely consumed spices with their mode of actions, as well as their preventive and therapeutic applications in oral health care ( [Table 1](#T1)). Turmeric [8](#B8) [9](#B9)]. It is a perennial plant, known as Circuma longa, which is a member of the ginger family, 'Zingaberaceae'. The active constituent of turmeric is known as curcumin [ [10](#B10)]. After consumption of curcumin, it undergoes intestinal metabolism and is absorbed, and excreted in bile [ [11](#B11)]. Antioxidant properties [10](#B10)] and species. As curcumin has both prooxidant and antioxidant properties, it is a superior compound to maintain a physiological homeostasis to prevent diseases [ [11](#B11)]. Anti-inflammatory properties Anticarcinogenic properties [5](#B5)]. Curcumin shows growth inhibitory effect on cell lines of various cancers like those of large intestine and bone, leukemia and oral malignant epithelium (derived from malignant tumor) [ [11](#B11)]. In different studies on the cell lines of various cancers, curcumin inhibited proliferation of cells and accumulated cells at G2/M cell cycle [ [11](#B11)]. A study on turmeric and oral cancer reported that curcumin taken either in diet or applied locally could significantly reduce DNA adducts [ [12](#B12)]. The number of adducted DNA 0.03% curcumin supplementation [ [13](#B13)]. Most importantly, curcumin effectively repaired the broken DNA strands in the peripheral cells [ [14](#B14)]. Curcumin also can deactivate tobacco carcinogens [ [8](#B8)]. Pathogenesis of cancer has been associated with various proinflammatory molecules like nuclear factor Kappa (NF) B, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and vascular endothelial growth [ [15](#B15)]. At the molecular level curcumin suppresses tumor promoter transcription factor NFB and apoptotic protein (AP)-1 [ [10](#B10)]. Research demonstrated that expression NFB, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and phosphorylated STAT3 patients [5](#B5)]. [14](#B14)] on inhibitory activity of inhibitor B Kinase (IBK) an enzyme responsible for NFB activation, the authors found that there was a reduction of IBK activity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSSC). [16](#B16)]. Also curcumin up-regulates genes related to cell growth arrest and down-regulates genes related to cancer cell proliferation such as egr-1, cmyc, bcl-X and mutated p53. egr-1, cmyc and bcl-X, and abnormal tumor suppressor gene such as p53 [ [11](#B11)]. Gene expression profiling by cDNA array was performed on total RNA extract from curcumin treated and untreated oral epithelial cancer cells. There was fourfold increase in the pro-apoptotic activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) in the curcumin treated oral epithelial cancer cells [ [11](#B11)]. Curcumin also effectively inhibits metastasis by decreasing invasive potential of a carcinogen through mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 [ [17](#B17)]. It ceases the proliferation of endothelial cells [ [10](#B10)] inhibiting VEGF study using OL lesion showed that curcumin reduced the size of a lesion by 10% in the treated 62 patients [ [11](#B11)]. In OSMF, curcumin reduces the micronuclei formation in exfoliated mucosal cells and in circulating lymphocytes. This protective effect on micronuclei formation can help to prevent oncotransformation [ [10](#B10)]. It can prevent and reduce the formation of fibrosis by acting as an antifibrotic agent in OSMF [ [9](#B9)]. Its mode of action is by blocking leukocyte influx and inhibiting the activation of inflammatory cells [ [10](#B10)]. Other therapeutic effects [10](#B10)]. Because of pharmaceutical effect of curcumin, it is now used as a supplement in several countries including the United States, India, Japan, Korea, Thailand, China, Turkey, South Africa, Nepal, and Pakistan [ [17](#B17)]. Garlic [19](#B19)]. Garlic acts as an antioxidant agent because of its high content of organosulfur compounds [ [20](#B20)]. Anticarcinogenic properties [5](#B5) [19](#B19)]. A previous study demonstrated that water extract of fresh garlic had apoptotic effect on cancerous cells and prevented the inception of oral carcinoma [ [21](#B21)]. Another study using 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) induced buccal pouch cancer model reported that, garlic caused apoptosis of malignant cells [ [6](#B6)]. It can act as an anticarcinogenic agent by scavenging the free radicals, increasing gluathione levels, increasing the activities of enzymes such as glutathione Stransferase and catalase, inhibiting cytochrome p450 2E1 enzyme and inducing DNA repair mechanisms; at the same time preventing chromosomal damages [ [5](#B5)]. Thus it is an alternative therapeutic agent for primary as well as invasive cancer [ [21](#B21)]. Other therapeutic properties [22](#B22)]. Garlic plaster was made and applied to the oral ulcer lesions and the patients were for 1-4 years. The authors found that the complete effective rate was 83.3% while total effective rate was 100%. Garlic exerts a strong antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Topical and dietary garlic has been used in the treatment of diseases like dermatologic infections and warts [ [19](#B19)]. Ginger [1](#B1) [23](#B23)]. Since old ages it has been an important ingredient in Ayurvedic herbal medicines for the treatment of rheumatism, nervous diseases, gingivitis, toothache, diabetes etc. It is the rhizome of Zingiber officinale Roscoe of Zingiberaceae family [ [1](#B1)]. Ginger consists of numerous pungent but active agents [ [1](#B1) [23](#B23)]. The major compound of ginger is gingerol, which can be converted to shogaols, zingerone, and paradol [1](#B1) Antioxidant of ginger an antiulcer therapeutic agent [ [23](#B23)]. Anti-inflammatory properties [1](#B1)]. Several researches have proved that gingerdiones and shogaols can act similar to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [ [23](#B23)]. Ginger is an effective agent against the pro-inflammatory cytokines which are secreted at the site of inflammation. It was demonstrated that ginger extract inhibited lipopolysaccharide induced activation of macrophages by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokines [ [26](#B26)]. Furthermore, it was revealed that ginger extracts were responsible for decrease in proliferation of T cells and thus decrease in production of IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-. Usually macrophages act as antigen presenting cell (APC) and thus are responsible for stimulation of T cell proliferation. These activated T cells then release IL-2 and IFN-. Anticarcinogenic properties [9](#B9)] through a decrease in Bcl-2/Bax ratio [ [10](#B10)]. Ginger inhibits NFB signaling pathway and thus represses COX-2 expressions [ [5](#B5)]. Ginger has a dose dependent cytotoxicity on oral carcinoma cells by activating caspase-3-mediated apoptosis [ [25](#B25)]. Other therapeutic properties [24](#B24)]. These favorable effects help to prevent tumor growth and metastasis [ [27](#B27)]. Gingerols and gingerdiol has a dose dependent antimicrobial effect. Studies demonstrated that they also act as an antiviral and an antifungal agent [ [23](#B23) [28](#B28)]. It can also acts as blood thinners by inhibiting platelet thromboxane-B2 (TBX2) and other production [ [29](#B29)]. These properties make it useful for the treatment of tooth ache, as a sialogogue to promote salivation for treating oral candidiasis and virus-1 infection [ [29](#B29)]. Honey Antimicrobial properties [30](#B30)]. Other than these, honey contains glucose oxidase which produces hydrogen peroxide which has a strong bactericidal action [ [30](#B30)]. Studies demonstrate that ingestion of honey can inhibit the growth of bacteria that causes caries and thus provides a carioprotective effect [ [30](#B30)]. It also inhibits the development of dental plaque, gingivitis, and periodontal diseases [ [31](#B31)]. Honey has antifungal activity by inhibiting C. albican [ [30](#B30) [31](#B31)]. Pichichero et al. [ [32](#B32)] studied the role of honey on C. albicans and found that the amylase present in honey increased the osmotic effect in the media by increasing the sugar concentration and consequently inhibited the fungal activity. Honey also shows antiviral activity against herpes labialis and rubella virus. Jungle honey acts as chemotactic inducer for neutrophils. [31](#B31)]. Antioxidant property is due to its content of glucose oxidase, catalase, ascorbic acid, flavonoids compounds [ [31](#B31)]. Furthermore, honey helps in increasing absorption and activity of some antioxidants like vitamin activity is responsible for preventing several chronic diseases including cancer [ [30](#B30) [31](#B31)]. Anticarcinogenic and other therapeutic properties [33](#B33)]. The authors demonstrated that honey has an apoptotic mechanism on OSCC and human ostogenic sarcoma (HOS) cell lines by acting as an antiproliferating agent. It induces apoptosis by up-regulating p53 and by modulating the expression of pro and anti-apoptotic proteins. It is also responsible for activation of caspase-3 pathway because of its phenolic and tryptophan components [ [29](#B29)]. It was hypothesized that honey transduced the apoptotic signal via initial depletion of intracellular non-protein thiols, and then consequently reduced the MMP by increasing the ROS generation required for apoptosis [ [33](#B33)]. Thus honey acts on cancer cell line by inducing cell-growth arrest by cell cycle blockage at the sub-G1 phase [ [33](#B33)]. [30](#B30) [33](#B33) [34](#B34)]. When honey is taken orally it activates the immune system by stimulating antibodies in primary and secondary immune response. It also stimulates inflammatory cytokines production. Manuka honey (jelly type of honey) specifically increases tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, IL-1, IL-6 by stimulating monocytes. Lower immune system is more prone to cancer, thus ingestion of honey can be beneficial for immunocompromized patients has a very strong antiproliferative property [ [34](#B34)]. Honey also has anti-ulcerogenic as well as anti-lipid effect. It has also been shown to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, anti-thrombotic, immune modulating and analgesic properties [ [31](#B31) [33](#B33)]. Honey is useful in preventing and controlling S. aureus infection by its enzymatic production of hydrogen peroxide property. Honey has a stimulatory action on wound repair and regenerative tissues [ [35](#B35)]. Study on animal model showed that it has an ability to decrease the number of inflammatory cells and hence can act as an anti-inflammatory agent [ [36](#B36)]. Antioxidant properties [38](#B38)]. and specifically against aciclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus-1 strains by interrupting the absoprtion of herpes viruses on cell wall [ [39](#B39)]. In oral cavity, anise kills odor-causing bacteria and thus so it is a natural herbal remedy for bad breath [ [40](#B40)]. Tomatoes [41](#B41)]. Fruits and vegetables consist of crucial constituent as phytochemicals. They are produced by plants. They are grouped isothiocyanates, glucosinolates, sulfides, diarylhepanoids, saponins [ [6](#B6)]. [42](#B42)]. It is not synthesized de novo by the human body and hence is available from diet only. It is mostly found in human buccal mucosa and immediately enter the plasma when consumed [ [43](#B43)]. Lycopene is an acyclic isomer of -carotene [ [42](#B42)]. They are found abundantly in tomatoes and in red fruits and vegetables, such as red carrots, watermelons, papayas, and grapes [ [43](#B43)]. Anticarcinogenic properties [44](#B44)]. Lycopene is a significant anticancer agent by its various mechanisms. Lycopene's ability for quencher of single oxygen is twice as high as -carotene and ten times higher than vitamin A [ [42](#B42) [45](#B45)]. It is a scavenger of free radicals preventing oxidative stress, which causes DNA damage [ [42](#B42) [45](#B45)]. Lycopene also inactivates free radicals which are responsible for lipid peroxidation process thus preventing tissue damage [ [42](#B42)]. Another anticancer mechanism is the suppression of carcinogen-induced phosphorylation of p53, Rb antioncogenes and stopping the cell division at the G0-G1 cell cycle phase. It acts as an antiproliferative agent by inhibiting insulin like growth factor and thus reduces proliferative capacity of cells. Modulation of immune functions is carried out by regulation of intrathymic T-cell differentiation [ [44](#B44)]. It also acts as an antitumor agent by induction apoptosis and modulation enzyme [ [42](#B42)]. Other therapeutic effects [42](#B42)]. It has been demonstrated that in OSMF, lycopene inhibited abnormal growth of human abnormal fibroblast, and an up-regulated lymphocyte resistance to stress. It has been proved that lycopene singly or with intralesional steroid injections has positive effect on mouth opening and at the same time can be helpful in alleviation of burning sensation symptoms. Thus lycopene has been claimed to be an effective, safe and reliable drug in OSMF [ [42](#B42)]. Conclusion [45](#B45) [46](#B46)]. However, the past decade has presented an outburst of clinical research to illustrate specifically what health benefits individual foods can offer, identifying the various nutrients and phytochemicals associated with these benefits. But lack of awareness and knowledge can devalue its use. Efforts to increase the understanding will help us provide a new horizon for improving various dimensions of an individuals' health. Thus prevention of disease at a household level will help improve the quality of life in the society in general. "}
