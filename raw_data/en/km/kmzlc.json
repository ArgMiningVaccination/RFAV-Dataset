Stoic Meditations with Jeff Krasno This course offers 10 contemplations to live a fulfilled life and minimize suffering. These exercises are framed by the three central Stoic disciplines: perception, action, and will. By refining the discipline of perception, you find mental clarity. By engaging in action that is ethical and just, you find purpose. And by exercising will, you learn how to identify and manage the things you cannot change and find the resilience to deal with life's challenges. Through these disciplines you will cultivate the stoic virtues of moderation, courage, justice, and wisdom. The ultimate goal: eudaimonia, the achievement of human flourishing and the minimization of human suffering.
