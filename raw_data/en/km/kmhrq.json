Several factors that put certain children at a higher risk for contracting RSV have been identified: they are age (<2 years old), prematurity, chr onic disease of known dysplasia), congenital heart disease, immunodeficiencies, and multiple congenital 2 anomalies. Immune prophylaxis against RSV is a preventive strategy to reduce the incidence of infection and its associated morbidity, including hospitalization, in high -risk infants Policy Length of Approval maximum of 5 doses or number of doses left until end of RSV season Benefit consideration Only ONE course of treatment is covered Monthly administration of immune prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with palivizumab during the RSV season may be considered MEDICALLY NECESSARY when ANY of the following criter ia are met in infants and children in accordance with guidelines -based recommendations : I. In first year of life - less than 12 months at start of RSV season a. Prematurity i. Infants born before 29 weeks, 0 days of gestation; AND ii. 12 months at start of RSV season b. Chronic Lung Disease of prematurity (Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia) Preterm infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity, defined as: i. less than 32 weeks, 0 day s of gestation at birth ; AND ii. requirement for > 21% oxygen for at least the first 28 days after birth ; AND iii. 12 months at start of RSV season c.

Congenital heart defects (CHD*) Infants and children with hemodynamically sign ificant CHD such as: i. infants with acyanotic heart disease who are receiving medication to control congestive heart failure and will require cardiac surgical procedures ; OR ii. infants with cyanotic heart disease in consultation with a pediatric cardiologist ; OR iii. infants with moderate -to-severe pulmonary hypertension ; OR iv. infants with lesions adequately corrected by surgery who continue to require medication for heart failure ; AND v. 12 months at start of RSV season * Examples of CHD - Atrial or ventricular septal defect, Coarctation of aorta, Fibrosis Children with cystic fibrosis who ALSO have at least one of the following conditions: i. Clinical evidence of Chronic Lung Disease (i.e., 32 weeks, 0 days of gestation at birth, requirement for > 21% oxygen for at least the first 28 days after birth) ; AND/OR i. Nutritional compromise ; AND ii. < 12 months at start of RSV season II. In the second year of life - less than 24 months at the start of RSV Season Prophylaxis based solely on the history of prematurity is not recommended in the second year of life. Prophylaxis may be considered MEDICALLY NECESSARY during the RSV season in the second year of life for infants who meet the following criteria: a. Chronic Lung Disease or Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Preterm infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity, defined as: i. less than 32 weeks, 0 days of gestation at birth ; AND ii. requirement for > 21% oxygen for at least the first 28 days after birth ; AND iii.

Summary of Evidence For individuals with high -risk indications for RSV in infancy who receive immune prophylaxis for RSV, the evidence includes several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), symptoms, morbid events, and hospitalizations. Evidence from systematic reviews of RCTs has demonstrated that RSV prophy laxis with palivizumab is associated with reductions in RSV - related hospitalizations and length of intensive care unit stays. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. For individuals w ith cystic fibrosis (CF) without other risk factors for RSV in infancy who receive immune prophylaxis for RSV, the evidence includes an RCT, several prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and systematic reviews. Relevant outcomes are OS, symptoms, m orbid events, and hospitalizations. Although some studies have demonstrated reductions in hospitalizations in palivizumab -treated patients, studies that used contemporaneous controls did not. In the available RCT, rates of adverse events were high in both the palivizumab and placebo groups, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the net benefit of palivizumab. A more recent nonrandomized study using noncontemporaneous controls found fewer RSV 7 infections in palivizumab -treated patients with CF. Additi onal studies are needed. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome . For individuals with immunodeficiencies without other risk factors for RSV in infancy who receive immune prophylaxis for RSV, the evidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are OS, symptoms, morbid events, and hospitalizations. Descriptive findings from a consensus panel and case reports of 2 infants with primary immunodeficiencies and 2 infants with acquired immu nodeficiencies in whom palivizumab was used with good compliance and efficacy have been reported in the literature. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. For individuals with Down syndrome without other risk factors for RSV in infancy who receive immune prophylaxis for RSV, the evidence includes a prospective cohort study. Relevant outcomes are OS, symptoms, morbid events, and hospitalizations. The available cohort study reported r educed rates of RSV - related hospitalization in treated patients but had methodologic limitations, including the use of a noncontemporaneous comparative cohort from a different country; such limitations introduce uncertainty into any conclusions that can be made. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Policy Guidelines Dosing and Administration Palivizumab is administered by intramuscular injection at a dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight per month. The anterolateral aspect of the thigh is the preferred injection site. Routine use of the gluteal muscle for the injection site can cause sciatic nerve damage. Clinicians may administer up to a maximum of 5 monthly doses of palivizumab (15 mg/kg per dose) during the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season to infants who qualify for prophylaxis. Qualifying infants born during the RSV season will require fewer doses. For example, infants born in January would receive their last dose in March (see Initiation and Termination of Immunoprophylaxis subsection below). Hospitalized infants who qualify for prophylaxis during the RSV season should receive the first dose of palivizumab 48 to 72 hours before discharge or promptly after di scharge. Break Through Respiratory Syncytial Virus Guidelines make the following recommendation on breakthrough RSV: \"If any infant or young child receiving monthly palivizumab prophylaxis experiences a breakthrough RSV hospitalization, monthly prophylaxis should be discontinued because of the extremely low likelihood (<0.5%) of a second RSV hospitalization in the same season.\" Practice Guidelines Table 1. Guidelines on Use of Palivizumab Prophylaxis for Infants (American Academy of Pediatrics) Recommend ations for Using Palivizumab Prophylaxis Prophylaxis recommended Infants born before 29 weeks, 0 days of gestation, during first year of life Infants born before 32 weeks, 0 days of gestation with chronic lung disease of prematurity, during first year of life 8 Children in the second year of life who require 28 or more days of supplemental oxygen and continue to require medical intervention during respiratory syncytial virus season Prophylaxis may be considered Infants with hemodynamically significant heart failure, during first year of life Infants with a pulmonary abnormality or neuromuscular disease that impairs ability to clear secretions from lower airways, during first year of life Children younger than 24 months who are profoundly immunocompromised during respiratory syncytial virus season Prophylaxis not recommended Healthy infants born at or after 29 weeks, 0 days of gestation There is insufficient evidence for children with cystic fibrosis or Down syndrome without other risk factors Policy History Date Action 10/2020 References updated. 4/2020 Removed BriovaRx from the Provider section. 10/2019 References updated. 9/2018 Added Accredo and BriovaRx to the Provider section. 7/2018 Clarified coding information. 11/2017 Added the State Standard PA form to the policy. 10/2017 Updated to change Walgreens Specialty Name. 6/2017 Updated address for Pharmacy Operations. 10/2016 Clarified second course of therapy Criteria. 10/2015 Updated to add Walgreens as a Specialty Rx Vendor. 8/2014 Update to include 2014 AAP practice guidelines. 7/2014 Updated Coding section with ICD10 procedure and diagnosis codes, effective 10/2015. 9/2013 Updated to include 2013 -14 vendor information. 9/2012 Updated: 9/2012 to update 2012 AAP guidelines and update HIT and Specialty Retail Pharmacy Network contact information. 11/2011 -4/2012 Medical policy ICD 10 remediation: Formatting, editing and coding updates.
