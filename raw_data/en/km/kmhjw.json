[](/how-to-do-a-juice-cleanse-ebook) How To Do The Master Cleanse There are three simple steps to performing the Master Cleanse, typically for a period of ten days or more: - Drink one quart of salt-water first thing in the morning - Consume six to 12 glasses of lemonade drink per day - Drink [herbal laxative tea](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=herbal+laxative+tea&crid=5G3J8XIX3CVF&sprefix=herbal+laxative+tea%2Caps%2C669&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)at night Rules of The Master Cleanse: - No solid food should be eaten - No enemas or colonics should be performed - No pills or food supplements should be taken Master Cleanse Recipes Salt-Water Flush Recipe Ingredients: - One quart luke-warm water - Two teaspoons sea salt (do not use iodized salt) Directions: - Combine water and salt. - Drink the entire quart of salt and water first thing in the morning.

In my Ebook, [How To Do A Juice Cleanse](https://www.goodnature.com/how-to-do-a-juice-cleanse-ebook/), I recommend starting off cleanse days with our [cleanse starter juice recipe](https://www.goodnature.com/recipes/juice-cleanse-starter-recipe/), which is similar to the lemon juice drink used in the Master Cleanse. It incorporates the lemon and also the cayenne to get your metabolism going first thing in the morning. You can find that recipe here: [Morning Kickstart Juice with Apple, Lemon, Ginger and Cayenne](https://www.goodnature.com/recipes/juice-cleanse-starter-recipe/) Does The Master Cleanse Work? There is no scientific evidence that supports the claim that the cleanse helps to eliminate disease and toxins out of the body. People have reported extremely fast weight loss on this fad diet, however, they have also reported that the weight comes right back on when resuming their normal diet. The reason for this? Most of the weight lost is water weight (and maybe some muscle...eek!) That being said, the Master Cleanse is basically a fast. If you are interested in fasting, you may want to consider other, more healthy ways to fast. I recommend a [3 day juice cleanse fast](https://www.goodnature.com/blog/3-day-diy-juice-cleanse/), where you are at least getting the nutrients your body needs to function properly! Is The Master Cleanse Safe? There are some health risks you should consider before starting the Master Cleanse or any other low calorie fasting diet: - It can cause unwanted side effects. Feeling dizzy, lightheaded, tired and foggy are all symptoms of not consuming enough calories\u2014not to mention being super hungry! - It can lead to lean muscle loss. When we are not consuming essential nutrients and protein that our bodies need, we can start to lose muscle. According to Melissa Wadolowski, a registered dietitian, \"Lack of protein is a huge culprit when it comes to muscle loss. The body doesn't store protein the same way it stores other nutrients, so, we have to eat it regularly. We can't expect fasting to do all the work, if what we do consume isn't well-balanced.\" - It's not sustainable. This is not a diet you will want to incorporate into your lifestyle for good, as it is basically a fast. When you are fasting, you are depriving your body of essential nutrients and it is not something that is healthy to do long-term. - It could be dangerous for people with health conditions. Those with diabetes, anemia, cancer, and other serious medical conditions need to be especially careful with low-calorie cleanses. Before you change your diet, you should consult with your physician. Also, pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding should avoid the Master Cleanse.
