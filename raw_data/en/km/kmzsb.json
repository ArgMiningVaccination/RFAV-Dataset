As a result, many people dread coming into the cold and flu season. The active ingredients in EOs interact with the body's physiology, providing multiple health benefits depending on the oil. For example, some oils can help reduce inflammation, stimulate circulation and increase immunity, which is beneficial for treating colds and flu symptoms. Not only that, many of these compounds have antiseptic qualities, which can help soothe throat irritation, reduce congestion and support the respiratory system. How do you use essential oils for colds and flu? Using essential oils for colds and flu is easy. There are several options depending on what you prefer, and you can combine them. An excellent way to treat yourself or your family during the cold and flu season is to diffuse them into the air. This allows you to benefit from them as they enter the bloodstream through the lungs. They can help reduce cold and flu symptoms, such as headaches, sore throats, and congestion. It's important to avoid overdoing this by diffusing too many drops of essential oil - just 1 or 2 drops is enough to be effective. They can also be added to a carrier oil and applied onto the skin as a topical rub. Most people would think to do this on the chest, but they are also very effective when applied to the soles of your feet (put some socks on afterwards, so you don't slip!). When added to a base cream, balm, or gel, they can help reduce the symptoms of colds and flu more easily. In addition, they can ease aches and muscular discomfort often associated with the flu. You can add a drop of oil onto a tissue and tuck it into your pillowcase at night.

These are great when you diffuse them in your home as the combination can be lovely, and you can swap them around in different rooms. We bet you will use some of these blends even when your sickness is long gone. Just make sure you don't use them neat on your skin!

Its natural antibacterial properties make it an excellent choice for preventing the spread of germs, while its aroma helps clear nasal passages. For the best results, starting diffusing Eucalyptus oil in your rooms is recommended at the first signs of getting sick. This will help prevent colds and flu from spreading throughout the household. There are several varieties of Eucalyptus, each with specific benefits. To get you started, get the Eucalyptus globulus variety for general use. If you have children, you should get the Eucalyptus smithii variety. Tea Tree oil is another popular remedy whose natural antiseptic properties help fight bacteria, fungi and viruses that could lead to illness. Its pleasant aroma keeps you calm and relaxed. What essential oil is best for cough and congestion? Peppermint EO contains menthol, which helps relax muscles in the respiratory tract, encouraging the expectoration of phlegm. It can also help to reduce the feeling of fever and a scratchy throat. Frankincense EO relaxes the intercostal muscles (the muscles between your ribs). This allows a greater expansion of your chest when you are breathing, which may help you oxygenate your system better. Eucalyptus EO is also great for treating upper respiratory infections as it reduces inflammation, making it an effective decongestant. Is Frankincense good for flu? Absolutely! [Research has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3924999/) that it reduces inflammation and pain and is even used in severe diseases. The anti-inflammatory properties of Frankincense reduce inflammation associated with the flu virus. It can be helpful to support clearing some nasal congestion and breaking up phlegm in the lungs. You can get a bowl of hot water and put a drop of Frankincense oil in it. Lean over the bowl with a towel over your head to capture the evaporating vapour \u2014 the Frankincense and the steam helps to loosen and dissolve stubborn congestion.

If you (or the person you are looking after) are lying back in bed, you can rinse a flannel in hot water with the oil and rest it on the forehead or chest, which will also feel a help. How to use essential oils for cold and flu symptoms There are many ways to get the medicinal properties of essential oils working hard for you. Add EOs to a diffuser for general use around the home and in a sick room. Add oils to a bowl or hot water. Lean over the bowl with a towel over your head. The steam inhalation helps to loosen mucous and phlegm. You can also use the warm water as a hot compress on the forehead, chest, or back. Add a drop of oil to a damp cotton ball and tuck it into the vents of a radiator. Make a blend of essential oils and add them to a carrier oil to be rubbed. This carrier oil blend can also be added to bath salts and milks (be sure to rinse the bath well afterwards). The same blend can be added to a large plastic bowl or box of warm-hot water to soak your feet in. Add different oil combinations to a balm, base cream or gel. These are easy to make for yourself. Can diffusers help with colds? The short answer is yes! Diffusing EOs such as Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Tea Tree, or Lavender oil can help reduce cold symptoms. Inhaling these aromatic oils can also help relax the body and mind, clear nasal passages and sinuses, and boost the immune system. All of these can help reduce the duration of your cold. If you don't have a diffuser, put a few drops on kitchen paper and rest it on a radiator. What should I diffuse for cold and flu?

This combination is perfect for keeping airborne infection down. Tips for effective use of essential oils when treating a cold or flu First, finding essential oils that contain the highest quality ingredients is vital. The best essential oils are not always the most expensive. MLM companies charge incredibly high prices for commonly available oils, and the quality has sometimes been adulterated. Choose brands that have a good reputation from qualified aromatherapists. The oil can be used neat in a diffuser, but don't be tempted to use too much. Just a drop or two is sufficient to permeate a room effectively. When using the oils on your skin, they must be diluted in a base cream-type product or an oil like Avocado oil or Coconut oil. Typically, 1% is a safe level. That means that in a bottle containing 99g of oil like Sunflower, Grapeseed, or Sweet Almond, you add 1g of EO, which is about 20 drops. That is now a 1% dilution. Of course, you can make less but keep the ratio the same and consult your professional essential oils therapist before adding more essential oils. Keep your oils and blends away from small children, and do not take any oils internally. There is further advice for using oils on babies. What oils should I diffuse for a stuffy nose? Stuffy noses can be a real problem! They can make breathing hard, distract you from your day, and even lead to sinus pressure and headaches. So which oils should you diffuse to get rid of a stuffy nose? Eucalyptus oil is a must-have for anyone suffering from congestion or sinus issues. Its intense aroma has powerful decongestant properties that help open airways and increase oxygen flow. Peppermint oil is another very effective oil for relieving congestion. Not only does its menthol scent soothe discomfort, but it also helps clear mucus out of the body's airways. It can also take away tension headaches. Of course, these options may not be available to you at work or when travelling to work on public transport. For these times, a stick inhaler works well. These small plastic tubes you unscrew and hold up to each nostril. Breathe in deeply, and the essential oils inside will work their magic. The most famous of these is the Olbas inhaler which contains a blend of Cajuput, Eucalyptus oil, and Peppermint and is a safe way to inhale essential oils. Just don't insert the stick up your nose; there really is no need to! How do you use Peppermint oil for a cold? A simple way to use Peppermint EO is to add a single drop to a cotton handkerchief. You can put this to your nose and breathe the vapour in. This is easier to use than steam inhalation when you are on the go. You can also use the handkerchief to blow your nose, but I'd recommend using a different handkerchief; otherwise, be prepared for an icy-cold feeling nose and be sure not to use the handkerchief to wipe your eyes as it could sting! Potential side effects with essential oil use Many people believe essential oils are completely safe because they are natural, but even natural products must be used safely. Always double-check which oils you will use, especially if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. This also applies if you have epilepsy or high blood pressure. Do not use undiluted essential oils on your skin, and keep away from mucous membranes. Always dilute essential oils in carrier oils or base cream/gel. Do not take any essential oils internally, which can be very dangerous. Don't go over the top - you only need to use a few drops to get good results. If you use a diffuser that has a candle, please be careful not to spill any oil near the flame. To be safe, people with skin sensitivities or existing health conditions should consult their doctor before any essential oils, or alternative medicines are tried. Final thoughts... Essential oils are a natural and effective way to relieve cold symptoms and get you through the cold and flu season. They can boost the immune system, reduce inflammation, and help ease congestion and muscle pain. They are easy to buy, and many will last for years when stored correctly. There are many different ways to use them. Overall, EOs are a safe and natural way to ease the misery of the cold and flu season, hopefully reducing recovery time and maybe, even the need for prescription drugs in some instances. "}
