Vaccine, as a means of western medicine, has been on the controversial side of traditional Chinese medicine. When it comes to disease, many Chinese people make strategic decisions based on their self-diagnose. Traditional Chinese medicine is known for it has less side-effects and its holistic way of thinking - that human body needs to be in harmony with the external environment. When the balance is disrupted, the body will get sick. Vaccine, as a means of western medicine, has been standardized and has been proven effect in lab, which is on the contrast of traditional Chinese medicine. During the COVID-19 pandemic, even though government has mandated the COVID-19 vaccination, many Chinese still hold belief in traditional Chinese medicine to prevent COVID-19. Some people even regard it as a national triumph. Other people think that traditional Chinese medicine is just placebos when it comes to COVID-19 prevention. People think both medicines can work together have waited for the vaccine to come out and take traditional Chinese medicine as a supplement. This could give health communicators enlightenment about COVID-19 prevention discussions on Weibo and factors that contributes to vaccine hesitancy. KEYWORDS: Weibo, Covid, Chinese medicine, Western medicine, social media 1 Chapter 1. Introduction On December 31, 2019, Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province (WHO, 2020). A novel coronavirus was then identified, labeling it COVID-19. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) made the assessment that COVID-19 outbreak can be characterized as a pandemic. Since it first broke out, COVID-19 has infected over 200 million people and taken over 4 million lives, according to the WHO. The spread of COVID-19 has reached almost every country in the world and has left damages across industries. According to the BBC (2021), the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE 100 Index, FTSE 100, FTSE), a share index of the 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalization, dropped 14.3% in 2020, which has been its worst performance since 2008 (Jones, Palumbo, & Brown, 2021). Many people have lost their jobs or had severely decreased income due to the economic shock the COVID-19 brought to the world economy. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been four pandemics before the COVID-19 Pandemic, there most recent one being the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic. The other ones are the 1968 Pandemic caused by H3N2 virus, the 1957-1958 Pandemic caused by the H2N2 virus, and the 1918 Pandemic caused by H1N1 virus which is also known as the Spanish Flu (CDC, 2018). Since immunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions for the prevention of infectious diseases, vaccines against COVID-19 are considered important for the prevention and 2 control of COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020). However, vaccine hesitancy has been an important barrier to preventing public immunization. China's vaccine perception is shaped by several elements, including fake information, conspiracy of the government, the risk of the disease, and the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine (Chou & Budenz, 2020; Wang et al., 2020). In addition, the perpetual influence of traditional Chinese medicine should be a factor to consider for health communicators when it comes to vaccine perception in China. Traditional Chinese medicine originated from the Han nationality, an East Asian ethnic group, in China and has a history of more than 3,000 years (Ding, 2004). As its dominant nationality, Han descendants have immigrated to surrounding areas like Singapore, bringing the ideas and skillset of traditional Chinese medicine with them (Chang & Lim, 2019). Traditional Chinese medicine is based on a holistic ideology, focusing on the inside of a person and the balance between the person and the natural environment (Hu, 2016). It is supported by China's government and many hospitals in China which operate on a traditional Chinese medicine theoretical foundation (Wang, Li & Chen, 2005), in which there are two concepts: \"minor\" illnesses and \"major\" illnesses (Ji, 2019). \"Minor\" illnesses being frequent, not serious, and possibly self-healing, like a cold, cough, or diarrhea. \"Major\" illnesses can be considered as life-threatening and can't be simply treated by taking over-the-counter medicines. Examples of some \"major\" illness include cancer, diabetes, and asthma (Ji, 2019). Many Chinese people make strategic medical choices between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine according to their own self-diagnosis. People tend to choose traditional Chinese medicine as treatment for \"minor\" illness since they believe it has fewer side effects and 3 can help people be nursed back to health while seek professional Western medicine for \"major\" illness (Jin & Acharya, 2016; Ji, 2019). Having been cultivated in the traditional Chinese medicine's culture, many Chinese people think about vaccines with concepts and ideologies as they relate to traditional Chinese medicine. Being a country with more than 1.4 billion people (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2021), it is an essential yet difficult job for China to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to its people to achieve public immunization. Therefore, it is important to understand how people perceive and discuss COVID-19 vaccines and learn about the discussion between COVID-19 vaccines as Western medicine and the long-standing traditional Chinese medicine through discussion on Weibo, the dominant social media platform in China with over 500 million active monthly users in the first quarter of 2021 (Statista, 2021). This begs the question of how the discussions around COVID-19 has changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the significance of vaccine in public immunity, the study focuses specifically on pre- and post- vaccine availability. In order to answer the research question, the researcher plans to use textual analysis in qualitative research methods to analyze people's expression and ideologies around the COVID-19 vaccine and concepts they hold based on traditional Chinese medicine. 4 Chapter 2. Literature Review History of Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine has been the dominant medical treatment system in China for thousands of years (Roth & Zhang, 2016). Unlike Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine is closely associated with Chinese culture and is characterized by a developed and closed social system, although it has absorbed other sources of treatment at different historical stages (Roth & Zhang, 2016). There were no modern hospitals in China before Western medicine became popular. Some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have clinics in the community or in their own houses, some go to patients' homes for treatment, and some are scattered all over villages (Roth & Zhang, 2016). Traditional Chinese medicine uses a holistic understanding that sees health as a dynamic balance within the body and a unity between the body and the natural world (Chang & Lim, 2019). For example, a person's perception of the seasons can have an impact on their lifestyle. According to the Yellow Emperor's Canon of Medicine, a traditional Chinese medicine classic that was finalized by scholars between 206 BCE-220 CE, the four seasons are characterized by spring birth, summer growth, autumn harvest, and winter storage, which means that energy starts to increase in spring, rapidly increases in summer, peaks in autumn, and decreases in winter (Roth & Zhang, 2016; Chang & Lim, 2019; Jin & Acharya, 2016). Therefore, people should follow the nature and get up early and go to bed late in spring and summer, because in these two seasons, they can greatly absorb energy (qi). Get up early and go to bed early in the fall to maintain energy balance. Get up late and go to bed early in the winter to conserve energy. 5 This theory has influenced the way of life of many generations of Chinese people (Li, 2005). Accordingly, Chinese traditional medicine believes that people should nourish Yang in spring and summer and Yin in autumn and winter. Therefore, tonics should not be taken in summer, because at this time the pores of the body are easy to open, which will interfere with the smooth circulation of qi and blood, leading to difficulties in the absorption and storage of nutrients. Therefore, winter is the best time to take supplements (Li, 2005; Roth & Zhang, 2016; Chang & Lim, 2019; Jin & Acharya, 2016). The characteristic of traditional Chinese medicine is deeply rooted in the long tradition of Chinese philosophy - the unity between nature and the human individual (Chen, 2009), that the body is never separated from the rest of the world. On the contrary, it is closely related to and regulated by nature (Li, 2005). This philosophy was developed around 500 BC from the Book of Changes (Confucius, BCE 551 - BCE 479), an ancient Chinese divination text and among the oldest of the Chinese classics. In order to help readers solve the problems they encounter, the Book of Changes emphasizes the general context in which the problem or event exists, rather than the problem or event itself (Chen, 2009; Ding, 2004). More specifically, the Book of Changes helps readers assess the context in which a problem occurred (natural or social), and then offers different options on the problem to help readers decide how to take action to solve the problem. To solve these problems, one must look at the situation, either to create a new situation conducive to solving the problem or to remedy the problematic situation, because the Book of Changes believes that if the overall situation is right, the problem is easy to solve. In short, the author of the Book of Changes believed that nature and human beings are in a single, unified entity, and human beings are subordinate to nature. This has 6 traditionally been described as a philosophy that emphasizes the whole situation over the individual (Chen, 2009; Ding, 2004). Influenced deeply by the Book of Changes, traditional Chinese medicine sees the patient as an individual that exists in nature (Ding, 2004; Chang & Lim, 2019). It claims that diseases occur because humans are out of tune with the earth, the seasonal cycle, or the human social environment. Therefore, it is less concerned with the patient's body and more concerned with the patient's natural and social environment. It claims that anger damages the liver, overjoy damages the heart, meditation damages the spleen, anxiety damages the lungs, and panic damages the kidneys (Li, 2005). Therefore, when a patient has a liver problem, he/she should evaluate his/her status. Perhaps the patient has been in a disturbing environment, which causes him/her to be angry, which in turn damages his/her liver. So, to treat a damaged liver, the patient must first analyze the situation, fully understand the situation, and correct it. Once the root cause of the problem is removed, the problem will disappear step by step. Due to the historical and philosophical root of traditional Chinese medicine, it has become a legacy in formatting Chinese people's collective identity as well as cultivating a social acknowledgement passed on by generations. The main ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine are normally herbs or plants, which people are familiar with (Ding, 2004). For example, if people suffer from any inflammation caused by germs, they often drink chrysanthemum tea. In other words, if a person is cultivated in Chinese culture, he/she will be unwittingly influenced by what he/she sees and hears about these herbs or plants' effects on the human body (Ding, 2004). Influence of Western Medicine 7 Controversy surrounds the dichotomy of Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. During the process of modernization and globalization, biomedicine has become dominant in many diversified healthcare systems, including those where indigenous treatments remain an integral part of everyday life (Chang & Lim, 2019). However, the controversy is that the new global discussion creates a separation between biomedicine and other parts of medicine. Since biomedicine has become an orthodox knowledge system, traditional medicine is regarded as alternative, marginal, primitive, unscientific, and fundamentally unconventional. (Chang & Lim, 2019). The orthodox/unorthodox dichotomy often leads to distrust and disapproval of traditional knowledge and practices, which in turn strengthens the privileged status of biomedicine and the secondary status of traditional medicine (Chang & Lim, 2019). Biomedicine is an extension of European science that emphasizes the use of scientific rules and tools to reveal the truth (Zhao, Yang, Wang, Jin, & Luo, 2021). By contrast, traditional Chinese medicine is based on a holistic ideology, focusing on the inside of the person and the balance between the person and the environment (Luo et al., 2020). Traditional Chinese medicine believes that good health results from the optimal interconnection between a person's physical, mental, and emotional states. Taking the human body as a whole, the body functions in a delicate dynamic balance. Disease occurs when the balance is disturbed and the ability to regulate is out of control (Luo et al., 2020). Differentiated from the symptoms of Western medicine, such as changes in specific pathological manifestations, the syndromes of traditional Chinese medicine reflect a summary of the essence of pathogenesis in a certain pathological process (Luo et al., 2020). Because of the complex pathogenesis, single medicinal materials often cannot meet the clinical needs 8 or cannot achieve the desired effect. Therefore, traditional Chinese herbal medicine should be combined together to play a comprehensive role (Luo et al., 2020). According to the characteristics and combination principles of medicinal materials, medicinal materials with different properties are combined to achieve specific clinical therapeutic effects and/or reduce toxic and side effects (Luo et al., 2020). The theory of Yin and Yang is deeply rooted in the traditional Chinese medicine system and is used to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment (Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2005). The Yin and Yang theory is a dualist concept originating from traditional Chinese philosophy. Ancient Chinese described both the opposite and yet related features, such as heaven and earth, white and black, sun and moon, day and night, heat and cold, up and down, left and right, in the concept of \"Yin and Yang\" to reveal the abstract meaning of mutual opposition and interdependence and called it \"qi.\" In traditional Chinese medicine theories, according to the Yellow Emperor's Canon of Medicine, Yin and Yang are the way of heaven and earth. Therefore, the theory of Yin and Yang was developed in traditional Chinese medicine to judge diseases and determine the direction of treatment (Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2005). Different parts, tissues and even physiological activities of the human body can be divided into Yin and Yang. For example: The back is Yang, and the abdomen is Yin; The outside is Yang, the inside is Yin; The top is Yang, the bottom is Yin; Movement is Yang, static is Yin; Qi, soul and god are Yang, and blood, body fluid and essence are Yin. According to the same principle, the meridians of the body are divided into Yin and Yang, and different types of diseases and syndromes can also be divided into Yin and Yang. Therefore, different treatments for the same disease come 9 from the different Yin and Yang ebb and flow (Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2005). Emphasizes the harmony between the universe and the human internal system, so that traditional Chinese medicine and biomedicine pay different attention to external reality. However, different ways of understanding and reasoning have also led to the perception that traditional Chinese medicine is based on myths in the natural world and is unscientific (Chang & Lim, 2019). The development of knowledge in traditional Chinese medicine has its own scientific nature, that is to say, the creation and verification of knowledge involves a systematic experimental process, rooted in trial and error, and years of observation. The knowledge system and terminology generated by this empiric-based epistemology are different from biomedical systems. In biomedical systems, positivistic thinking, repeatable verification and standardization are the rules for obtaining knowledge claims. However, the divergence between these two knowledge systems creates communication barriers and judgements about which approach is effective (Chang & Lim, 2019). Traditional Chinese medicine has long been regarded as outdated and lacking in improvement, but its value lies precisely in its thousand-year history. The ideological difference lies in the clash of worldviews, such as the old and the new meanings (Chang & Lim, 2019). The practitioners regard \"old\" as positive, valuable, reliable, and persuasive. Similarly, an ideological struggle has arisen between traditional Chinese medicine's reliance on empirical knowledge and biomedical's emphasis on positivist evidence (Chang & Lim, 2019). Western scientific methods are the basis for biomedical training and the benchmark for evaluating the reliability and effectiveness of biomedical treatments (Chang & Lim, 2019). Biomedicine requires the 10 same level of standardization in traditional Chinese medicine, which practitioners found difficult to achieve. Pulse reading is an example - practitioners rely on abstract thinking and make inferences based on the symptoms they observe (Chang & Lim, 2019). Traditional Chinese medicine in China, unlike in other countries (Chang & Lim, 2019), is well-supported and encouraged. In China, traditional Chinese medicine is not considered to be just a rural traditional therapy that uses only raw natural substances from plant, animal, and mineral materials, which is often seen as a complement to Western medicine (Wang, Li & Chen, 2005). On the contrary, Chinese traditional medicine and Western medicine, though different, are equally treated as means to cure people, as can be seen from the fact that China's National Medical Products Administration has two departments, one responsible for traditional Chinese medicine and the other for Western medicine (Wang, Guo & Li, 2016). What's more, traditional Chinese medicine, like Western medicine, has been developed and processed through modern science (Ding, 2004; Jin & Acharya, 2016; Ji, 2019). Traditional Chinese medicine is considered to not contain any chemical ingredients like western medicine, because the label of traditional Chinese medicine does not require chemical formulas or empirical formulas. The use and management of traditional Chinese medicine does not seem to receive as much attention as Western medicine (Ding, 2004). Traditional Chinese medicine is unlikely to produce an overdose problem because it does not need the title \"overdose,\" probably because it is not considered to contain chemicals like Western medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine is unlikely to cause side effects or adverse reactions to patients, or its side effects or adverse reactions (if any) are minimal for patients, compared with vaccination as a means of western medicine (Ding, 2004). 11 Perception of Vaccines in China Over the past decade, vaccine scandals and a series of reports of serious side effects have added to hesitancy and distrust of national immunization programs in China. In July 2018, Chinese vaccine manufacturer Changsheng Biotechnology was found to have falsified production and test records and arbitrarily altered process parameters and equipment in the production of a freeze-dried human rabies vaccine (The Lancet, 2018). In addition, substandard diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) vaccines produced by Changsheng Biotechnology were used on 215,184 Chinese children; 400,520 doses of substandard DPT vaccine produced by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products were sold to Hebei and Chongqing. This scandal caused many people including parents to lose faith in the vaccine system (The Lancet, 2018). Concerns or uncertainties about the safety of vaccines have also led to vaccine hesitation. Public concern about vaccine safety is often reported as a major obstacle to vaccination decisions, especially for newly introduced vaccines that have not yet been fully tested in the real world (Wang et al., 2020). Based on existing research, Chinese people's willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccines is high based on a high level of awareness about the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination (Leng et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Most people believe that there is less concern about getting the coronavirus after vaccination. The higher proportion of clear intentions among participants from central and southern regions, which is related to the number of confirmed cases, indicates that people from areas heavily affected by the COVID-19 expressed a higher intention to vaccinate. Service industry participants expressed a higher willingness to vaccinate, indicating that they are 12 aware of the protection needs of workers in contact intensive industries (Lin et al., 2020). Study also finds that local vaccine coverage was less important than attributes such as side effects, accessibility, and disease burden. The more acquaintances who were vaccinated, the more likely individuals were to be vaccinated against COVID-19 (Lin et al., 2020). This finding suggests that herd immunity through vaccination will lead to higher levels of vaccine acceptance through altruistic motivation and weaken free-rider motivation. Rapid and extensive media dissemination of local vaccine coverage helps to increase vaccination rates (Leng et al., 2021). The pandemic has had a profound impact on the work, income or daily life of the Chinese population. To address these challenges, they argue that the benefits of vaccination are greater compared to the risks, which is another factor contributing to personal preference regarding COVID-19 vaccine (Wang et al., 2020). Framing Theory The main theory used in this study is the framing theory. According to this construct, media focuses attention on certain events and then places those events within a larger field of meaning (Goffman, 1974). This extension of the agenda setting theory studies the way the media and media gatekeepers organize and introduce the events and issues they report, thereby affecting the audience's views and attitudes towards these events. Essentially, framing theory says that how something is presented to an audience affects people's choices about what to do with that information. A framework is an abstract concept used to construct the meaning of information. The most common use of a frame is to frame the information that news or media convey (Davie, 2011). They are thought to influence the audience's perception of the news, and in this way, it can be 13 understood as a form of second-level agenda-setting: they not only tell the audience what to think about, but they also tell them how to think about the problem. Gregory Bateson (1955/1972) first used the term frame in its current sense in a paper on the psychology of perception (Ard\u00e8vol-Abreu, 2015). And Goffman developed the theory in social science. He proposed that people interpret what is happening around them through their primary framework (Davie, 2011). Goffman points out that there are two differences within the main framework: nature and society. Both play a role in helping individuals interpret data. Thus, their experiences can be understood in a wider social context (Davie, 2011). The difference between the two is functional (Davie, 2011). The natural framework identifies events as physically occurring and does not attribute any social forces to the cause of the event. The social framework sees events as socially driven events that are caused by the whims, goals, and manipulations of other social actors (Davie, 2011). The social framework is based on the natural framework. These frameworks and the frameworks they create in our communication greatly affect the way data is interpreted, processed and communicated. Goffman's basic assumption is that individuals are capable users of these frameworks in their daily work, whether they are aware of them or not (Davie, 2011). The first communication research article using the word \"framing\" was published in Journalism Quarterly in 1980. (Ard\u00e8vol-Abreu, 2015). L\u00f3pez-Rabad\u00e1n and Vicente-Mari\u00f1o (2009) proposed that the evolution of framework theory be divided into three main stages. The first stage was from 1974 to 1990, which was characterized by the instrumental application of the sociological definition of the term. It is at this stage that the theory began to enter the field of communication. The second phase, the 1990s, mirrors the definition of framing as a specialization of media 14 studies, an application of media discourse analysis, and an uncontrolled and decentralized methodology. At this stage, some people think that the framework law is just an extension of agenda setting, while others think that the framework law is a complementary but different theory. There is a fierce theoretical debate between them. The third phase of restructuring and empirical development began in the early 21st century and continues to this day. In this third phase, an attempt was made to achieve conceptual and methodological unity, leading to a more solid and rapid development through research synergies (Ard\u00e8vol-Abreu, 2015). In this theory, health communication can be framed to highlight the benefits of engaging in a particular activity (gain-frame) or the consequences of not engaging in an activity (loss-frame) (Gallagher & Updegraff, 2011). In their study, they found out that the gain frame is more convincing than the loss frame when it comes to promoting actual preventative health behaviors (Gallagher & Updegraff, 2011). By using this theory, the study aims to explore how social discussion around COVID-19 vaccine is constructed and shaped over social media, as well as to better understand the relationship between means of Western medicine - the COVID-19 vaccine - and the belief and cultural ideology in traditional Chinese medicine. It can help to compare and demonstrate that when undergoing a global pandemic, how these two dichotomous medicines are perceived by Chinese people over social media platform. The Influence of Weibo Weibo is a Chinese microblogging website. Launched by Sina Corporation in August 2009, it is one of the biggest social media platforms in China (He, 2021), with over 530 million monthly active users as of March 2021 (Statista, 2021). Within 12 years 15 of its appearance, the platform has transformed from a horizontal space for news dissemination and political debate to a vertically connected professional user, which is identified as a network of expertise (Chen, Wu, & Li, 2018). Social media has also empowered Chinese scientists. Empowerment is the process by which individuals gain access to and control over valuable resources. One of the main methods of empowerment is participation in social and public affairs, participation in decisions that affect community life, and influence social events. Both content search and content creation on the Internet empower media users from a Uses and Gratifications perspective (Chen, Wu, & Li, 2018). In the Chinese context, the Internet has created a new sphere of communication and empowered users by bypassing traditional regulatory mechanisms. The traditional media in mainland China has created a monopolistic public sphere, in which the ideology of the party state dominates political and cultural discourse, and China's cyberspace has become a new public sphere without the protection of well protected freedom of speech and civil society (Fu & Lee, 2016; Chen, Wu, & Li, 2018). Grassroots promoters such as intellectuals, writers, bloggers, independent filmmakers and artists are playing an active role in shaping online debate about a variety of contemporary and theoretical controversies in the public sphere of cyberspace in China, together with traditional media organizations (Fu & Lee, 2016; Chen, Wu, & Li, 2018). In a country like China, where freedom of expression in a physical space is limited, social media has fostered more and more participatory democracy. Although a considerable number of political issues are highly regulated and reviewed, some non-political issues, such as health and science, are less regulated, allowing a certain degree of openness, criticism and resistance in these public areas. The deliberative nature of social media and the 16 openness of microblog to a certain extent enable the scientific community to put forward ideas and opinions on social issues, which is an important empowerment way (Chen, Wu, & Li, 2018). Health Communication on Social Media Health communicators have been studying how social networks impact health communication across the world. for example, in Australia, researchers have studied how young people use their social network sites as apart of sexual health communications, where researchers find that in Australia, the vast majority of health institutions have not effectively used social media or SNS to promote the health of young people. When health organizations use these media, they still use them in a one-direction way and do not make effective use of the characteristics of the media, such as interactivity and companionship Share (Evers, Albury, Byron & Crawford, 2013). Participants supported the establishment of an online forum where sexual health-related questions could be posted anonymously and answered by professionals (nurses/doctors). They believed that this will be more private than seeing a doctor regularly or interacting through personal files on SNS and social media (Evers, Albury, Byron & Crawford, 2013). YouTube, as a popular social media platform, has played an important role in health communication. For example, it can be used for sexual health communication. Some participants suggested that videos of people asking questions about sexual health and getting answers should be broadcast on YouTube. When mobilizing the video, everyone stressed that the content should be humorous (Evers, Albury, Byron & Crawford, 2013). Facebook, as another dominant social media platform, has also been studied by researchers. In their research, Stellefson and others find that most Facebook 17 posts guide diabetic patients to other online resources (such as websites, other Facebook pages, other Facebook groups) for supplementary information. Similarly, patients share information with other patients rather than reflecting their own personal experience. This finding is not surprising because diabetic patients are still worried about how online health portals operate and what rules are shared by individuals. In addition, the results show that the public diabetes Facebook group is more used to supplement and/or acquire knowledge about diabetes rather than supplement or replace offline social support (Stellefson, Paige, Apperson & Spratt, 2019). Another study on diabetes and Facebook finds that Facebook provides a rich social media background for investigating health communication. Using image, diabetes outcome information, control information, negative emotions, social support, positive identity encouragement and crowdsourcing can predict higher participation through love, sharing or commentary, while external links predict lower participation. The use of images weakened or reversed the positive correlation between diabetes outcome information, control information, negative emotions, positive identification and social support, and user participation. User participation seems to depend on specific feature patterns, which shows that the best information transmission can be achieved by carefully designing the health communication provided by social media and using specific features to promote specific types of participation (Rus & Cameron, 2016). Studies about health communication has been going on major social media platforms across the world, such as YouTube and Facebook. However, as a country with 1.4 billion people, the study of health communication on Weibo is lacking and requiring experts' focus. It is important for the researchers to study health communication on 18 Weibo not only because its dominant role in Chinese population but also for it has opportunities to reveal patterns that other social media platforms have not. It is also important for the researchers to take a look at worldwide health communications besides the dominant ones across the world. With the topics studied previously on other social media platforms, like diabetes, it will be interesting to see how Weibo users communicate with each other under the same topic. Research Question Based on a review of the extant literature, more research is needed to understand the relationship between the framing effect of traditional Chinese medicine and people's perception of COVID-19 vaccine, therefore, this study seeks to address the following research questions. The research question of this proposed study is how the discussion around the prevention of COVID-19 on Weibo has changed after the vaccine became available regarding the belief in traditional Chinese medicine. RQ1: On the social media platform Weibo, how has the discussion around COVID-19 prevention evolved based on people's belief on traditional Chinese medicine, specifically pre- and post- vaccine availability? 19 Chapter 3. Methods The method used to conduct this research is textual analysis. By using this method, text is analyzed as cultural artifacts, which can be used as material evidence to make our lives meaningful. Researchers seek to understand the context of certain history and culture by interpreting given text (Brennen, 2017). The development of textual analysis in journalistic studies is associated with the publication of German sociologist and critical theorist Siegfried Kracauer's work, \"The Challenge of Qualitative Content Analysis\" (Brennen, 2017). Kracauer questioned the use of quantitative content analysis in communication research, challenging the reliability and objectivity of breaking things down into parts and then counting them. For Kracauer, quantitative content analysis focuses on describing only the superficial content of texts, a method that leads to incomplete and unclear analysis. For example, content analysis considers repetition to be an important measure of value, ruling that the more times a word, concept, or idea is encoded in a document, the more important its evidence is. In contrast, for Kracauer, it is more important to consider the text as a completion than repetition. Analysis, he explains, is an act of interpretation that considers both the superficial meaning of a text and its underlying intent. According to Kracauer, the goal of textual analysis is to reveal all potential meanings in a text (Brennen, 2017). Textual analysis has been applied to many health communication research on social media. For example, researchers have studied how YouTube can be used to share patients' education materials with many people living with chronic diseases, especially for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient (Stellefson et al., 2014). In their study, the researchers used content analysis to study how YouTube is used to share knowledge 20 among patients as well as comparing related videos to other diseases like heart disease or diabetes, which videos of COPD are much less than other diseases (Stellefson et al, 2014). Content analysis can also be used to assess whether microblog posts about COVID-19 could predict the number of reported cases in the early stages of the epidemic (Li, Xu, Cuomo, Purushothaman & Mackey, 2020). Through their research, they find out subjects that were publicly discussed at the early stage of the pandemic on Weibo, including the causative factor of the disease, the change in the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, and the public response to the outbreak control and response measures (Li et al, 2020). Gathering Weibo posts provides a first-hand opportunity for the researcher to observe how people make sense of their lives around the COVID-19 vaccine and the cultivation of traditional Chinese medicine. It also gives insights into people's depictions of their lives through their words and photos without other media filtering anything. The gathering of Weibo posts regarding a specific topic during a pandemic can shed light on the certain context of the society in particular - the health communication construction in China. The data gathering process took place through Gooseeker, a Web crawler that helps fetch specified content on Weibo. Web crawlers are computer programs that scan the web and go through everything they find. They crawl the entire site by following internal links, allowing them to understand the information contained (Thornton, 2020). The web crawler, which directionally captures relevant web resources, is a program that downloads web pages automatically. It selectively visits web pages and related links on the world wide web according to the established crawler target to obtain the required 21 information. It aims to capture web pages related to a specific topic and prepare data resources for subject-oriented user queries. This method helps researchers to capture desired content with specific keywords without having to waste time and money on collecting everything especially when used on studying social media. Gooseeker functions like a web browser, which helps researchers who have no skills in computer coding to fetch data. As of 2021, it has been used for a decade to assist data collections from websites both in China and in other countries (Gooseeker, 2021). Once a keyword is typed in, it runs the coding program and fetches all posts having the keyword. For the purposes of this research, the keywords for the crawler to identify posts is \"vaccine + Chinese medicine\" (\"\"). The date parameters of the posts will be limited to posts published March 11, 2020; the day the COVID-19 outbreak was characterized as a pandemic to October 01, 2021. This study argues that the starting date also works well as COVID-19 had been present in China for nearly two months, with Chinese people being under lockdown, and facing economic loss and severe mental health pressure due to the uncertain future of the pandemic. After collecting the posts, I filtered out the posts that did not specifically refer to COVID-19 vaccinations, explicitly or implicitly. I chose 20 posts from every month's gathered posts, which engaged in emotional response to either COVID-19 vaccine or traditional Chinese medicine's credibility, like claiming that all traditional Chinese medicine are just placebos or all vaccines are government conspiracy in order to make money, discussion involving their choices of COVID-19 prevention like whether they are getting vaccinated or consuming Chinese medicine as means to prevent COVID-19, and 22 points of views towards the cultural values behind either form of medicine. The final sample consisted of 380 posts in total. The sampling method used is purposive sampling, which relies on the researcher's judgement while choosing samples for further research. This sampling technique can effectively explore the situation of anthropology, in which the discovery of meaning can benefit from intuitive methods (Dudovskiy). When sampling, the researcher will exclude posts that are not talking about COVID-19 vaccine then start from those left. The research will purposefully be looking for posts with context, especially those engaging with other bloggers in a larger topic or having identified the background of their posts. The researcher will also look for posts with rhetoric, metaphors and other forms like limerick, which helps to give more depth to future discussion will be included into the sampling. Engagement will be another criteria for the researcher to look at since having more comments, likes and repost suggests that the post have reached more people and generated more heated discussion, which is the researcher is looking for. After sample collection, I engaged in the axial coding process. Axial coding involves phenomenon, causal causation, strategies, consequences, context, and intervening condition (Corbin & Strauss, 1999). The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a need for prevention, which creates the dichotomy of western medicine, the vaccine, and the traditional Chinese medicine. Based on the historical and cultural context of traditional Chinese medicine in China, it is important to note blogger's biases towards vaccines. Their strategies of prevention can help suggest people's preference on which medicine to rely on, which helps the health communicators to shape their strategies about how to prevent people from getting infected. 23 I looked for relevant expressions relating to COVID-19 prevention, COVID-19 vaccine, and traditional Chinese medicine beliefs. The inclusion criteria will involve relevant ideological implications linking the COVID-19 vaccine with traditional Chinese medicine, like beliefs from traditional Chinese medicine affecting moods or consideration of perceiving the COVID-19 vaccine. For example, if one posts content like \"I will stop eating something spicy after several days of getting my vaccine\" will be considered relevant. On the contrary, if the posts only mention getting the COVID-19 vaccine, but not related ideas or concepts of traditional Chinese medicine will be excluded. The data analysis process will consist of a series of codes that the researcher will specifically look for, like terms of \"spicy,\" \"stimulating food,\" and \"shower,\" which all belong to beliefs of traditional Chinese medicine. In traditional Chinese medicine, the ancient oriental philosophy developed the qualitative and holistic concept of Yin and Yang and the five elements theory to describe the impact of food on human health (Xie, Huang & Kong, 2020). In the belief of traditional Chinese medicine, the use of food is just like medicine, which can promote or hinder the healthy development of the human body according to the type of food and the characteristics of the human body; eating spicy or stimulating food after getting vaccinated will disturb the effect of the vaccine. Another example of this process, if a person posts that traditional Chinese medicine heals better than western medicine or vice versa, or traditional Chinese medicine is unscientific/valuable because of its old history, it can be characterized into the ideological frame as it identifies the ideological belief the person holds towards traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine. If a post claims that traditional Chinese medicine is the only way to save people from COVID-19, it will be 24 characterized into the political frame as it belongs to nationalism thinking and sees traditional Chinese medicine as a cultural triumph. The ideological frame mainly contains posts include values related to medicine, including both traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine. It is a broader scope involving people's emotional, cultural, philosophical and social recognition and response towards both medicines and their values. It includes people's cognition and understanding of both medicines, the sum of ideas, viewpoints, concepts, thoughts and values people hold towards both medicines. On the contrary, the political framing specifically stands for the values of national identity and governance. Codes or keywords used in the process of selecting each post is included in the appendix. The most used terms are \"vaccine ()\" and \"Chinese medicine ().\" Within posts mentioning either or both terms, other emerged terms include \"western medicine (),\" \"traditional Chinese medicine (),\" \"COVID-19 prevention ()\" etc. Once the codes are complete, the researcher will convert all axial codes into frames that consist of similar phrases and concepts. Noting that since all the posts will be in Chinese, the researcher will take extra caution when translating the post content into English to maintain the original meaning of the user to minimize potential loss of credibility. The researcher will also translate certain Chinese idioms or cultural phenomena when analyzing the posts to better construct the social context and reality mentioned in the posts collected from Weibo. The following section will discuss the findings from the search, the axial codes, emergent and emergent themes. This will be followed by a discussion of the implications 25 of the findings for Chinese Weibo audiences, the COVID-19 situation, and framing theory. 26 Chapter 4. Findings The researcher gathered Weibo posts involving the keyword \"vaccine\" and \"Chinese medicine\" from March 11, 2020, to October 01, 2021. There were 380 Weibo posts in total that the researcher divided into two categories: political and ideological. The ideological category has four groups of posts: 1) posts supporting that traditional Chinese medicine is the only way to prevent and heal COVID-19; 2) posts supporting vaccine as a means of western medicine is the only way to prevent COVID-19; 3) posts supporting both traditional Chinese medicine and COVID-vaccine can work together to help prevent and heal COVID-19; and 4) posts involve traditional Chinese medicine's holistic ways of thinking. Political Framing The political category has posts presenting traditional Chinese medicine as a national triumph and involves anti-westernism. Among the 380 Weibo posts, 264 (69.5%) of them hold positive attitude towards the effect of traditional Chinese medicine has on COVID-19; 139 posts (36.6%) are in support that COVID-19 vaccines can be used against COVID-19; 61 posts (16.1%) show that the bloggers think both COVID-19 vaccine and traditional Chinese medicine can work together to help prevent and heal COVID-19 and 63 posts (16.6%) involve the traditional Chinese medicine's holistic ways of thinking. There are 63 posts (16.6%) engaged in political aspects, including regarding traditional Chinese medicine as a national triumph or anti-westernism. With posts that portrayed Chinese medicine as a national triumph and involving anti-westernism, some of the posts also engage with conspiracy theories that the 27 government is developing vaccine because it helps make money while traditional Chinese medicine cannot. The most significant example is posted by ChanTongDaYouShiZuoZhe on July 29, 2021: \"The COVID-19 pandemic is coming and is too critical trapped, Chinese medicine is up! By comparing effectiveness, everything is clear. 600,000 deaths in the United States, all western medicine is out of the way. Chinese medicine has done wonders, thanks to the old ancestors. The two comparisons have been qualified, western medicine has almost no effect. The old ancestors who saved the suffering and left a legacy that is of great use ... How to achieve high benefits, eliminating Chinese medicine must be engaged. Cure all with western medicine, rolling money can only arrive ... Western medical instruments to rely on, imported equipment prices are high, a variety of fishy often exposed, I do not know whose wallet the money goes to. Although very efficient, the survival of Chinese medicine is very difficult to protect. Japan is very happy, Chinese medicine, I want all the Chinese medicine. COVID-19 pandemic suddenly came, the right and wrong grudge has been clear ... The strength of Western medicine is the vaccine, which is the savior. What if there is no vaccine? The main reliance is on Chinese medicine ... Now both cures must be prepared, keep up with the variation to win. With the wonders of Chinese medicine in hand, human health is the mission!\" In this limerick, the blogger not only complemented the importance of traditional Chinese medicine, but also brought up the conflict between traditional Chinese medicine 28 and western medicine. The blogger sees the western medicine as dominant treatment in China and thinks that it generates great benefits. The blogger also claims that the profit drives the western medicine industry to boycott traditional Chinese medicine. As thanking the ancestors, the blogger holds the attitude that the traditional Chinese medicine is a national triumph and saves Chinese people from the COVID-19 pandemic. By listing the United States' death numbers and describing Japan as a sneaky thief, the blogger expresses his stance as a nationalist, looking down upon other countries without respect and regard them as competitors. Ideological Framing In this frame, there are four groups of posts. The first one is posts supporting traditional Chinese medicine is the only way to prevent and heal COVID-19. Some of these posts resonate with the first group of political categories - regard traditional Chinese medicine as a national triumph. This is the most dominant type of all the Weibo posts collected. On August 30, 2020, maghsiao posted: \"COVID-19 pandemic flooded outbreak, Chinese medicine are magical wonders. A bowl of Chinese medicinal soup and a dose of traditional Chinese medicine can subdue hundreds of viruses. Although people dream to smear and boycott, arrogant virus is afraid of magical Chinese medicine. The United States has strong and best vaccine, 150,000 people get sick a day. Steal our prescription to make pills, use our Chinese medicine with a cheeky face. Keep being arrogant if you are not afraid to die.\" 29 This post is written in a limerick form with sarcasm to express the blogger's strong belief in traditional Chinese medicine's effect in healing COVID-19. The blogger also takes a firm stance on opposing the COVID-19 vaccine, using the COVID-19 cases in the United States - the fiercest competitor of China as a comparison, which also demonstrates the blogger's nationalistic view. Another example to be looked at is from wolfXuShouPangGuan. On July 02, 2020, the blogger posted: \"The city is locked down. The roads are taped off. The community is surrounded. The quarantine is mandated, and masks are worn. Chinese medicine cures a hundred percent. Why bother to expect vaccine and specific medicine. This wastes man power and money and everyone's life is in danger. A single dose of Chinese medicine will get rid of all diseases, so why such nonsense.\" Also written in limerick form, this post complains about the inconvenience of locking down the city and the blogger's faith in the power of traditional Chinese medicine. It also shows his/her thoughts on China developing COVID-19 vaccine - a waste of money and man power. Not only wolfXuShouPangGuan but many other bloggers all express their opinions on the lack of necessity of China developing COVID-19 vaccine. On April 24, 2020, ZhongShengZhongYi posted: \"Traditional Chinese medicine is perfectly capable of dealing with epidemics, as history has proven. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, there was no vaccine, but the plague was still defeated. Epidemic prevention and control should be put first.\" 30 On September 30, 2020, LaoNongLoveUnix posted: \"Don't worry. Vaccine is not as effective as Chinese medicine. Compared to Chinese medicine, vaccines are nothing.\" On October 22, 2020, WangHeiQi posted: \"There's no need for vaccine since there is Chinese medicine.\" On February 09, 2021, YiZhiYaoYongHaoZi posted: \"I suggest not to get vaccinated. Take more Chinese medicine is enough.\" On April 11, 2021, FaYiDianDianGuang posted: \"I firmly will not get vaccinated, although the government offers free vaccination and encourage people to get vaccinated. I believe that only Chinese medicine can keep this country alive.\" These similar posts suggest the common mindset among some people believing the capability of traditional Chinese medicine's effect on preventing COIVD-19 and their doubts in vaccine as a means of COVID-19 prevention. Besides the commonality of their attitudes towards the effect traditional Chinese medicine has on preventing and healing COVID-19, the posts also show bloggers' points of view on disbelief on the development of COVID-19 vaccine. In their opinion, having traditional Chinese medicine is both a medicinal and cultural protection that China specifically holds. What's more, their confidence in traditional Chinese medicine has also involved the holistic way of thinking of traditional Chinese medicine. According to many bloggers, they believe that COVID-19 vaccine, as a means of western medicine, has unwanted side effects to human body compared to traditional Chinese medicine, which adds to the hesitancy and refusal towards COVID-19 vaccine. For example, on August 31, 2021, BuNengFangQiNaiXiDeMouXi posted: 31 \"After looking around of Chinese and western medical analysis of vaccines, it is clear that the side effects of vaccines are not to be ignored. Adolescents whose bodies are not fully mature, those with underlying disease, young and middle-aged people who are weak on a daily basis and elderly should not be vaccinated. ...... Reagent composition, unpredictable reactions to viral waste entering the body, virus mutation, etc ... If you are not a population at high risk of exposure, vaccination is basically not recommended and is a self-inflicted initiative that will not necessarily have the opportunity to kill the enemy ...... With the domestic epidemic under such good control, the rest of the population is not at much risk of exposure and may not need to be vaccinated at all. In case the situation changes afterwards due to the influence from outside the country, we can consider taking Chinese medicine for prevention. We must not let the vaccine destroy the health foundation of more than a billion Chinese people.\" Similarly, on the same day, BuNengFangQiNaiXiDeMouXi, as a daily record of her life, posted that she had severe dizziness and doctor had given her LianHuaQingWen, which is a Chinese Medicine that focus on treating influenza. She wrote: \"Vaccine to cure COVID-19 and Chinese medicine to cure vaccine.\" Therefore, the nature of vaccines, which injects virus into human body, can be rejected by certain people who worry that the virus injected can be harmful to their bodies or cause severe side effects. They tend to trust traditional Chinese medicine for it has fewer side effects compared to western medicines as the remedies and ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine are herbals and other natural components. 32 Another debate worth noting is that a portion of bloggers have divided vaccines into China developed vaccines, like KeXing Vaccine and western developed vaccines like Pfizer vaccine. The scientific difference between the two vaccines is that Chinese vaccines are inactivated vaccines while the western ones are mRNA vaccines. Bloggers like this tend to regard China as having developed vaccines with Chinese medicine components, which cause them to either welcome it for it is believed to have fewer side effects or distrust it with other forms of Chinese medicine. Like LuYouWenXianSheng posted on January 15, 2021: \"Anyone without political bias knows that Chinese vaccines are better. It is likely to include Chinese medicine ingredients which are stable and radical\". In this post, the blogger not only expresses his preference on Chinese vaccines, but also links traditional Chinese medicine with people's political biases, which will be explained later in the political category. Another blogger, YangGuangZeTian posted on April 24,2021: \"The mRNA vaccine is synthetic, equivalent to western medicine, which has good efficacy but high risk. Inactivated vaccine is made from nature, equivalent to Chinese medicine, not as effective as western medicine but less risky.\" Being on the contrary with the previous bloggers, there is another group of bloggers who believe that only vaccines, especially made by the west, can be the cure of COVID-19. These types of bloggers hold a firmer belief in the unscientific aspect of traditional Chinese medicine and use more straight-forward expression when posting. For example, on March 20, 2020, FangFeiChenSi posted: \"Only vaccines can treat COVID-19 virus. All of China is looking forward to a vaccine, not a few Chinese medicine placebos.\" 33 Likely, on September 09, 2020, LiuJianWu68 posted: \"The global human race, including the Chinese, has a variety of vaccines, western medicine and western drugs from childhood to old age can help to prevent, cure and control a long list of major diseases (such as polio, cervical cancer, rabies, leukemia, diabetes, hypertension and depression ...). They have significantly reduced or even eliminated all human-related diseases and significantly improved the quality of human life worldwide. What can traditional Chinese medicine help to prevent? To cure? Which disease can it help to control?\" On November 21, 2020, BuYiShuTongABC posted: \"Does it hurt your conscience to fool the public like this? We have the COVID-19 under control because the masks and quarantine, right? If Chinese medicine works, why the hell are we in wartime state? Wouldn't it be better to just use Chinese medicine? In fact, Chinese medicine is just a placebo, no pharmacological effect at all! There is only one way to deal with the virus, and that is the vaccine!\" Therefore, these bloggers have serious doubt in the function of traditional Chinese medicine and basically regard it as placebos. They regard vaccines as the only means to solve the pandemic and question the effect of traditional Chinese medicine - if it works then there will be no pandemic at all. They put their entire trust in vaccines, which is a means and a representative of modern western medicine. The third type of bloggers believe that traditional Chinese medicine and vaccines can work together to deal with the pandemic. Many put faith in traditional Chinese medicine before the vaccine became available. At the beginning of the sampling, 34 bloggers were waiting for the COVID-19 vaccine to come out. For example, on March 31, 2020, ReXueChanQi-YeLaiXiang posted: \"Before vaccine and specific medicine are available, it's hard to control the situation without taking traditional Chinese medicine. Don't even think about it like those who are anti-traditional Chinese medicine.\" There are similar posts like this. On April 25, 2020, 3DQiXiangZhanZ posted: \"The real test is here! In the absence of a vaccine for the time being, Chinese medicine prevention is imminent! However, so far only local Chinese medicine prescriptions are available for prevention! Unfortunately, there is no national prescription! So people are waiting!!!\" These posts point out that before the vaccine became available, people were putting hope on the effect of traditional Chinese medicine. They believe that traditional Chinese medicine have the ability to help control the number of infected cases and also help to save lives. On December 07, 2020, right before the vaccines became available in China, 3DQiXiangZhanZ posted: \"Single cases are frequently increasing, only wearing masks and washing hands cannot stop the COVID-19 from rebounding. (The government) should hurry up and implement Chinese medicine preventing soup across the country. Everyone should enhance external prevention along with internal prevention and wait for the vaccine to come out!\" These posts show that traditional Chinese medicine is regarded as precaution to help prevent COVID-19 before the vaccines are available. After December 31, 2020, the 35 day COVID-19 vaccines came out in China, the discussion evolved into a new direction: some people believe that traditional Chinese medicine and vaccines can both work together to help prevent COVID-19. Like YuZhouJingLingZhiWang posted on May 28, 2021: \"If traditional Chinese medicine can be applied to regulate the information channels of the human body systems and enhance the body's self-healing power, coupled with the mRNA vaccine with precise anti-material nature to annihilate the pathogens, the most perfect healing result can be achieved by treating both the symptoms and the roots!\" Also, on July 20, 2021, HuaHuaTianJiang wrote: \"Isn't it better to have vaccines + traditional Chinese medicine prevention?\" These posts illustrate that these types of bloggers view both traditional Chinese medicine and vaccines as means to help prevent COVID-19. They recognize the medical function of both medicines. The last type bloggers have shown their belief in traditional Chinese medicine as their posts have demonstrated holistic way of thinking when it comes to vaccine as a means of western medicine. They have questions based on their holistic belief of traditional medicine as they have been cultivated in this culture. There are different opinions generated from this way of thinking. One is that based on the holistic thinking, the bloggers refuse to get vaccinated while the other bloggers question whether it's appropriate to get vaccinated under certain circumstances. The example for the first station is like WoYongYuanAihellokitty posted on August 18, 2020: \"Vaccines are cold 36 in nature and the best way to do is to nurse one's health. Anyone who understands traditional Chinese medicine will not get vaccinated.\" This blogger suggests that in traditional Chinese medicine's holistic thinking's point of view, it is important to balance one's body condition. Getting vaccinated means injecting cold liquid into your body, which will disturb your body temperature's balance, causing possibly unhealthy situations. On June 27, 2021, XingXingHuaHuaDianDeng posted: \"If the situation gets worse in the fall and winter, the virus must be different from now. The climate has changed, and so has the environment in human body. The viruses in the human body must be different - either being heat-resistant or cold-resistant ... we should continue the success of last year with strong control and taking Chinese medicine ... whether the pandemic can be over is a battle between good and evil. The human body's righteousness vs. the virus.\" In this post, the blogger uses the traditional Chinese medicine's knowledge of \"qi,\" and applies the Yin Yang theory - the human body's righteousness is Yang, and the virus is Yin. The rest of the bloggers simply worry about effects of vaccines based on their belief in traditional Chinese medicine. On April 21, 2021, RuiRuiZaiNuLi posted: \"I got my vaccine today and it was very light. The amount is likely to be just a drop. The doctor advised not to eat seafood and not to exercise strenuously.\" YouHhh posted on June 17, 2021: \"...cannot eat beef right after getting vaccination ...\" 37 On June 20, 2021, ManTianXingXingBuYu posted: \"Since I am getting vaccinated tomorrow, I cannot run for these few days.\" All these posts suggest that the bloggers are thinking in the holistic ways of traditional Chinese medicine, as they believe that vaccines entering their bodies with effect and behaviors above will cause conflicts to the vaccine's effect, hence disturbing or disrupting the balance his/her body is at. 38 Chapter 5. Discussion Weibo has been a public forum for people holding all perspectives to publicly express their stances and opinions. Based on the findings of the Weibo posts gathered, many bloggers have used the Weibo to shape the discussion of the prevention of COVID-19 and extended the discussion into many directions. The dominant discussion is that major bloggers who post with \"vaccine\" and \"Chinese medicine\" are in support of traditional Chinese medicine as means to prevent COVID-19 as well as some of them even see it politically as a national triumph. When traditional Chinese medicine is under attack, they will react emotionally believing that their cultural and national identity is under attack as well. A portion of these bloggers even think that traditional Chinese medicine is the only way to end COVID-19 pandemic while the others think both traditional Chinese medicine and vaccines and work together to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. The rest group of bloggers hold opposing attitudes towards traditional Chinese medicine while regard the vaccine as the only way to put an end to the pandemic. The discussion of COVID-19 prevention also has evolved pre-and post-vaccine availability. Among those who believe that traditional Chinese medicine and vaccines can work together to help prevent COVID-19, before the COVID-19 vaccine came out, the bloggers awaited the vaccine and believed that traditional Chinese medicine can be a means to help prevent the COVID-19 and help boost people's immune system. After the vaccine came out, people regarded traditional Chinese medicine as a supplement to COVID-19 vaccine as they can work along both lines to help prevent the virus. 39 According to the findings, it suggests the health communicators to conduct more thorough and explanatory content regarding the effect of traditional Chinese medicine. The findings indicate that a large portion of scientific, authoritative, and approachable knowledge of both traditional Chinese medicine is missing, leaving bloggers to choose how to prevent the virus largely by their ideological and political preference instead of making decisions with accurate information. Without a homogeneous voice, it also leaves bloggers to debate with belief and opinions rather than facts, leaving a chaotic battle ground when it comes to the discussion of COVID-19 vaccine and traditional Chinese medicine as means of viral prevention. This also deepens the controversy between traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine - that traditional Chinese medicine sounds like myth and is old and unscientific if without a scientific voice to back it up. This research also resonates with the holistic way of thinking in traditional Chinese medicine that many bloggers hold the belief in the harmony of human body so that they worry that their diet of spicy or stimulating food would affect the effect of the vaccination they received. The cultural influence of traditional medicine is perpetual in the current Chinese society, showing that traditional Chinese medicine remains a significant role not only in medical field but also in social institutions. Also, since this study only looks at how people on Weibo reacts to traditional Chinese medicine and COVID-19 vaccine, it only can be a representation of those who argue on Weibo but can't be regarded as a study on Chinese people. Also, since 380 out of over 16,000 posts are chose, this is a regulated study and only a small portion of posts are studied. More researcher needed to be done. 40 The voice of opposing vaccines is another factor to be considered by health communicators when promoting COVID-19 vaccines. Existing study suggests that vaccination choices are influenced by belief in alternative medicine, belief in conspiracy theories, moral, religious and personal ideologies, emotional appeals, or lack of trust in authorities (Germani & Biller-Andorno, 2021), like part we have seen in the findings. The study finds that Anti-vaccination advocates have found a battle ground on Facebook and Twitter in particular, as these platforms provide a digital space for people to share any type of content, including scientifically related or medically sensitive content, that has the potential to reach a wide audience. Parents who decide not to vaccinate their children, for example, often form their opinions after being exposed to online information on the subject, and most do not consider the credibility of the source (Germani & Biller-Andorno, 2021). According to Reuters, China's vaccination rate is 91.8%. With this high vaccination rate, there underlies the voice of opposing vaccine, especially given the fact that many people believe in the effect of Chinese medicine can prevent and heal COVID-19 alone. The high vaccination rate is more of a result of government mandate. Although with a collective nation nature, it suggests that not everyone exercise the government mandate unconditionally, people still having doubt in their heart about effectiveness of vaccine, government conspiracy of making more money out of vaccine and belief in traditional Chinese medicine. It can also be an interesting example for future health communicator to take a look at how government mandate can impact personal decision on getting vaccination as well as how it affects vaccine hesitancy. People's belief in 41 Chinese medicine can also be considered as a factor to vaccine hesitancy given the specific nature of traditional Chinese medicine's perpetual influence in Chinese society. Limitations & Directions for Future Research Since this study looks specifically on the relationship between traditional Chinese medicine and COVID-19 vaccine, the keyword set for the web crawler is \"Chinese medicine\" and \"vaccine.\" Therefore, the posts researcher focused on during this study were largely specified on the points of view bloggers hold towards either or both the means to prevent COVID-19 and the conflicting stances opposing groups take on the credibility of each medicine. With the specified search range within the two keywords, other posts contain similar content but not the keywords have been filtered out. Also, within the small range of posts, voices from bloggers will be magnified given the design of this research. Future research should look at how other forms of traditional medicine's response towards the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, how native Americans use their traditional medicine to prevent the COVID-19, and how people's response through other social media platforms towards the prevention of COVID-19. 42 Chapter 6. Conclusion For this research, I found that Weibo posts could be categorized into two groups: ideological and political, while the former one has four sub-groups. The bloggers from first two sub-groups - believing that traditional Chinese medicine is the only cure and vice versa - tend to have intense debates on Weibo. Those who don't believe in traditional Chinese medicine are given label called \"Anti-TCM,\" meaning this group smears traditional Chinese medicine in Chinese. The opposing group use this label to self-identify to other members and to express their stance towards traditional Chinese medicine. The debate between the believers and the \"Anti-TCM\"s on Weibo can be intense since the topic is not as regulated as other topics like politics. The debate mainly unfolded around whether the traditional medicine is scientific or not. Many times, when debating about this topic, cultural and political aspects will be brought up as well since most believers have a traditional Chinese medicine's upbringing like having holistic way of thinking. This debate tends to cause division among Chinese citizens and damage the relationship between traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine, doing harm to the development of the two medicine types working together to help prevent COVID-19. Some people do support traditional Chinese medicine, so perhaps doctors and healthcare professionals need to maintain some cultural sensitivity when discussing these issues with their patients, because while western medicine is scientifically proven to help fight COVID-19, they may also have to express positive feelings toward traditional Chinese medicine in order to get people to stop being hesitant. 43 Appendix 1.
