It means that for the next few hours, your mind, body and soul get the rest, rejuvenation and relaxation it deserves\u2014and needs. There are varied treatments offered in spas to suit a wide range of individuals and their preferences. There are those who like treating themselves to 90-minute full body massages. Others prefer to start their me-time indulgence with a body scrub followed by a nourishing wrap. Some also head to the spa for their rejuvenating facial treatments. I personally like to mix things up whenever I head to my favorite pampering sanctuary. On some days, I'll spend a good amount of my time in hydrotherapy followed by 20 minutes in the infrared sauna and a detoxifying body scrub. Some days, I treat tired muscles and tissues to a good kneading and a delicious high vibrational snack afterwards. Regardless of what I might be in the mood for, I will always seek a unique spa experience that uplifts my energy levels. The newly opened [Anda Fitness Spa Center](https://www.andaspa.com/) at the Ivy Hotel in Minneapolis is currently on top of the wellness destination bucket list. The spa's chic and contemporary space on the second floor of Ivy Hotel will immediately clue you in on a unique wellness approach. By the entrance is a 68-lb rose quartz crystal flown in from Madagascar. It is embodiment of the facility's philosophy for \"capturing the essence of crystal based practices, lacing holistic influences throughout a gathering place of energy.\" Signature treatments and rituals make use of high frequency, healing crystals to help elevate vitality, balance and overall sense of wellbeing. Before treatments, guests can unwind inside the Aura Room, an immersive space for relaxation. This is followed by an exclusive Rose Quartz infused bath soak which completely puts mind, body and soul at peace. The aromatic and soothing soak utilizes fragrant herbs and essences such as Sambac Jasmine, French Lavender, Rose Absolute, Ylang Ylang and Dead Sea Salt. A few minutes inside Anda's Cambria Quartz sauna aids in detoxifying before a massage. There is also option to use to Quartz Lined Steam Rooms. Therapeutic body rituals like the Himalayan Salt Stone Massage or the Alpine Arnica Muscle Repair Enhancement are unique spa experiences that integrate varied healing traditions like Eastern medicine, thermal therapy and halotherapy. Facial rituals at Anda also integrate the use of healing crystals. The Gemstone Rebalancing Ritual by Naturopathica, for instance, features a gemstone roller which helps bring back skin elasticity, youth and radiance. Facials by Kypris, similarly, use the powers of Rose Quartz (a crystal for fostering unconditional love) or Laboradite (good for purifying energy and opening chakras) in cleansing, refining and decongesting skin. Time for self-love is hardly an indulgence. It's necessary for establishing a positive state of mind. It is also essential for empowering one's with the realization that to become truly happy, one only need to show the self acceptance, love and compassion. There are countless expressions of self-love. It may come in the form of a long candle lit bath at the end of a long day or a quiet Sunday afternoon curled up with a good read. Whatever your preference, an invigorating and unique spa treatment should be a welcome idea. "}
