Thankfully, there are ways you can support your immune system and your overall well-being.* We'll discuss basic immune function and learn more about how you can naturally support a healthy immune system through good lifestyle choices. With the cold and flu season just around the corner, it's a great time to reevaluate your remedies. Look at your health stack, lifestyle habits, and stress levels, and determine whether your actions are helpful or harmful to your immune system. What Is the Immune Response? The immune system is the system in your body that keeps you healthy and helps you fight sickness and infectious disease. These illnesses can come from numerous external stressors, like bacteria, fungi, and viruses.REF#2366 When your body sees something as an intruder, like bacteria or illness, it uses immune cells to create an immune response. By sending white blood cells to the area, your immune system attacks and eliminates the intruder.REF#2366 At the same time, your body also creates antibodies. These antibodies remember the specific illness and are better able to fight it off immediately the next time you are exposed to it.REF#2366 This is a pretty efficient and effective system, which is why vaccines are designed to help in just the same way. How Can You Support Immunity? When our immune system is working properly, we may still get sick, but we are able to recover quickly. Luckily, we can give our immune system a boost by making a few lifestyle adjustments. Wash Your Hands We've known for decades that hand washing is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of illness and safeguard your immune system. Experts state that scrubbing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 to 30 seconds (or about the length of time it takes you to sing Happy Birthday twice) will get the job done.REF#2362 Manage Your [Stress](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/what-does-stress-look-like) The immune system works closely with your body's stress response. In fact, when you are under heavy stress, your body may respond by suppressing the immune system, which could leave you susceptible to more frequent illnesses.REF#2367 You can protect the way your body reacts in stressful situations by [taking care of your adrenal health. ](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/meet-your-adrenals)The adrenal glands are responsible for creating important hormones in the body and for regulating important electrolytes that keep your body functioning properly.REF#2368 Take Your [Herbs](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/5-herbs-for-immune-health) There are plenty of natural immune boosters available, and it can be difficult to determine which ones are the most effective.

REF#2364 Get Some Sleep Part of any healthy lifestyle is getting enough sleep. Most adults need somewhere between seven to nine hours of sleep a night, but you may need more or less depending on your activity level. It's also important that you get quality sleep.

Eat Fruits and Vegetables Daily You can't outrun your diet. If you aren't eating properly, your body will feel it, and you can develop more than just an uncomfortable yearly conversation with your healthcare provider \u2014 you may also experience illnesses more frequently. When you eat a balanced diet, you're giving your body the calories it needs to support immune system function. Loading up on fruits and vegetables can help keep your caloric intake low and increase your daily fiber, vitamin, and mineral intake. It's generally a good idea to aim to load up at least half your plate with these antioxidant-rich foods.REF#2365 Look for colorful foods like citrus fruits, bell peppers, and red cabbage. These foods are often high in antioxidants, which can support your immune system. Additionally, you need macronutrients. Healthy fats, proteins, and complex carbohydrates round out a healthy diet and can help support your cells and bolster your immunity.REF#2365 Making sure your diet is diverse can benefit your body and help protect you against obesity.REF#2365 Eating a diet rich in immune-boosting probiotics can also help support your gut microbiome and bolster your resistance to infectious diseases. You can get probiotics from fermented foods like kimchi, yogurt, and kefir. Drink Water We know the importance of being hydrated in the summer months, but it's also an important health factor year-round. Making sure you are fully hydrated can help support your immunity and even aid in digestion. When you get sick, drinking fluids is even more important. What is the best liquid for illness? Whichever one you can tolerate. If you are queasy, [ginger](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/gaiakids-tummy-tonic) may help settle your stomach. However, water is the most gentle on the stomach and is generally helpful in relieving dehydration.
