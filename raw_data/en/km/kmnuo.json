Toxins in the body cause inflammation, which can lead to neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, as well as reproductive disorders and cancer. The main goal of detox treatment is to identify the toxins affecting a patient and remove them. These toxins often come into the body through pollutants, chemicals, and packaged food. The team at Portland Clinic of Holistic Health works with you to determine any present chronic illnesses, infections, cancers, or symptoms that can benefit from detoxing. They may use food intolerance testing to determine if your inability to digest certain foods properly is turning them into toxins. The team then creates a detox plan that aims to restore overall body health. This plan may include nutritional changes, natural medicine options, acupuncture to reduce stress, IV therapy, and Bio-Thermal Therapy\u00ae to promote the body's overall healing and restorative capabilities.
