The fundamental element of medicine in the Medieval time period is the theory of humours. This theory followed through until they reach the 19th century where more modern analysis could conducted. Humours also known as principle fluids are made up of four different fluid found in each individual: black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm. Each of the fluids are found in different organ of the body, black bile resides in the spleen and is the cause for melancholy, yellow bile is secreted by the liver and can cause irascibility, phlegm comes from the lungs and can be denounced to sluggishness, and the final Locura is a culture bound syndrome that affects Latin Americans and Hispanics, regardless of where they are born, in the United States or South America (Jilek 2001:5,9). Locura has also been documented in immigrants from the Caribbean Islands (Razzouk 2011:517). In Columbia, Locura is also known as \"ataques de locura\" madness attacks, it is attributed to a spell known as \"maleficio\". Locura is commonly associated with other culture bound syndromes thru out Central and South America, such as ataques de nervious (nervios) and possession syndromes (Pi\u00f1eros 1998:1425). Healthy People 2020 asses the health status of the United States population. According to Health People.gov \"measures of general health status provide information on the health of a population. Measuring health status can be done by monitoring life expectancy, years of potential life lost, and disparities in health care access. Measuring heath status is used in health care because it makes it easier to understand health outcomes. Native American author, Mourning Dove, stated, \"What kept us going, was the knowledge that everything on earth has its purpose, every disease an herb to cure it, and every person a mission. That is the Indian theory of existence.\" (Mourning, 1990, p. 69) Histories that deal with health, illness, and medicine in America, often make passing mention of Native Americans as healers or sources of knowledge about medicine. Similarly, histories of Native-American cultures and early European contact pay attention only to health and healing with respect to these cross-cultural interactions. Many books and articles have been written on Native American medicine. However, there have been virtually no scientific studies done on tribal healing practices, undoubtedly due to the spiritual nature of the treatments. Some of these historical pieces of literature attempt to assess the impact of Native-American knowledge of New World herbs on the knowledge and practice of early-American elite physicians and botanists. Healing and medical practices of Native Americans has been obscured by time but there is anecdotal evidence available and competing perspectives about the true values of Native American healing practices When the Spaniards reached the land that would become New Spain they found a culture with a sophisticated medical practice. Aztec physicians and healers had a wealth of botanical knowledge and were also capable of performing surgeries. Anyone making the assumption that the European medical tradition the Spaniards brought with them to the New World was in any way more advanced would be making an egregious error. The medicine practiced by the Aztecs was far superior to the medicine practiced by their conquerors. Social model often ensures physical and mental health and broader sphere of participating in active life. The model permits most understated discrimination of people that succeed to lead productive lives irrespective of physical damage. The disadvantage of social model is the approach that runs the threat of excessive breadth and to incorporate all life. Therefore, they do not differentiate among the state to become healthy the concerns of being healthy neither do they differentiate among \"health\" and \"health determinants\". African-Brazilian religions are represented, among other experiences, chiefly by Candombl\u00e9 and Umbanda. They are characterized by spirit possession - the Orishas, or ancestors - who take possession of the body of a person, the medium, and meet the demands of subjects who seek their guidance. They are derived from the knowledge of African religious beliefs that came to Brazil with the black diaspora, and that brought a great amount of knowledge about how to treat disease and preserve health. This knowledge associate a comprehensive response to a series of somatic, psychological, social, spiritual and existential dissatisfactions, offering people explanations about the disease events generating pain and suffering. In this context, the aim of Critical care nursing is defined as the field of nursing with an attention on the most extreme care of the unstable or critically ill patients following extensive surgery, injury and/or life-threatening diseases. (Australia 's Future Health Workforce - Nurses, 2014) 'Absence of diseases' is a common definition of health within our society. However, it cannot completely express the definition of health since health is affected by many factors but not only biological and physiological. The philosophies and practice of healing in the 19th century could be described as both a little elaborate and strange. There is a belief that the potential cause of experimenting with the effects of different plants derived from watching the behavior of animals after consuming them. The plants that caused For a long time, the use of psychoactive plants have played a role in the cultures of indigenous peoples. They are often plants that come in the form of peyote, fungi, and more. These plants are then ingested as a part of a ritual or ceremony with the focus on healing, growth, gaining insight, curing disease, and in a way taking a good look at one's own heart. When psychedelics are used for the purpose of spiritual growth and insight they are called entheogens. As opposed to a person simply taking a psychoactive substance for the purpose of just tripping, participating in ceremony or ritual creates a profound experience. With marijuana being as popular as it is, it has more than enough names that it goes by and that is shocking to me. Marijuana is also known by Ganja which is the term that Jamaica people use.

Fry: marijuana cigarette dipped in embalming fluid, sometimes also laced with PCP or Crack Cocaine. You also have names for this that I have never in life heard of like Fry: which is Marijuana In order to answer this question we will take a look at the meaning of 'placebo' and 'placebo effect', along with it's historic and changing connotations. Once we have established how we should define the power of 'placebo' we will explore it's use in herbal medicine, both in some traditional systems of herbal medicine and modern Western herbal medicine. We will conclude by considering to what extent 'placebo' is useful in modern Western herbal medicine. Naturopathic medicine philosophy serves as the basis for naturopathic practice. The current scope of naturopathic practice includes, but is not limited to: The University of Maryland Medical Center states that Herbal Therapy also called botanical medicine or phytomedicine, refers to using plant's, seeds, berries, leaves, barks, or flowers for medicinal purposes. Herbalism has a long tradition of use outside conventional medicine. It is becoming more mainstream as improvements in analysis and quality control, along with advances in clinical research, show the value of herbal medicine in treating and preventing diseases. Herbal medicine is a natural, non-toxic way to treat many conditions of ill-health.
