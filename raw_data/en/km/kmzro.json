Shoulder Arthritis - is the most common reason that many patients have a shoulder replacement. When the cartilage in the shoulder wears down, the space between the ball and socket joint becomes smaller, this can cause pain and a decrease in the range of motion in your shoulder. Arthritis can occur due to age related changes, inflammation, or after an injury. Rotator Cuff Arthropathy - if your rotator cuff is no longer functioning, you may have poor range of motion of your shoulder. A shoulder replacement can help to restore the function and improve the pain in your shoulder if your rotator cuff is not repairable. Total Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty The ball and socket are reversed with this replacement. A metal ball is placed where the socket was and the plastic socket connected to a stem is placed in the arm bone. See X-ray examples at right >>>Shoulder replacement: 6 Backus Hospital Joint Replacement Pre-Op Patient Education Class Patients who plan to undergo Joint Replacement Surgery are required by their orthopedic surgeons to attend the Joint Replacement Pre-Op Class.

In preparation for your surgery, you must complete a pre-operative medical risk assessment at our Perioperative Assessment & Testing Center (PATC) within 30 days of your procedure. Your visit will take approximately 60 minutes and will cover your medical history, current medications, physical exam, appropriate pre-operative testing, procedure-related education, and, if needed, a pre-anesthesia consult. The PATC strives to ensure you have a safe and successful surgery. How PATC Works 1. Your surgeon's office schedules your surgery at Backus Hospital. 2. You will receive a call from PATC to schedule an appointment for your preoperative surgical risk assessment and exam if the surgeon's office has not done so for you already. 3. Based on your medical history, you may be referred to a specialist physician prior to surgery. For example, if you have a cardiologist (heart doctor) or pulmonologist (lung doctor) that you see routinely, additional testing or clearance may be required prior to your surgery. What to bring to your PATC appointment: Government issued photo ID. Insurance cards or forms. A list of medications, including nonprescription and herbal supplements (include the name, dose and how often you take each one). - These can have unwanted effects when combined with other medications or anesthesia. You will receive instructions regarding managing your medications before surgery. A family member or friend to accompany you if possible. During your PATC appointment you will: Meet with a medical assistant, an Advanced Practitioner (APRN ) and, if needed, a nurse case coordinator or anesthesiologist. Complete a history and physical examination, blood work, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) swab, and EKG if required. Complete airway and sleep apnea assessments for anesthesia. Receive pre-operative and anesthesia education. Receive instructions regarding your pre- and post-operative medication.9 Importance of having a support person It is important that you choose a family member or friend to be your support person. Support persons are people who help you throughout this journey. It should be someone who can assist with your daily activities in the immediate post-operative period and when you return home. A support person will be needed to drive you to appointments or therapy sessions until you are cleared by your surgeon. We believe patients respond well to the assistance of their support person. Their encouragement and support will help you progress during recovery. If you live alone, consider having a friend or family member stay with you for the first few nights. Please identify here who you can rely on after surgery and note their phone number for your convenience: Name Phone Name Phone Name Phone10 After your PATC appointment : Your healthcare team will provide resources for obtaining medical equipment and confirm your choice of home healthcare provider, if applicable. PATC Location : Backus Hospital 326 Washington Street, Norwich, CT Parking is available at the Main Entrance Enter building and proceed to preregistration; a member of the PATC team will escort you to the center after registering. If you have any questions about your PATC visit, please call 860.889.8331 ext. 2142 11 Medications Be sure to inform your provider of ALL the medications you are taking, including : Vitamins Over the counter drugs (such as aspirin, antacids, pain relievers, etc.) Herbs and \"natural\" products These can all have unwanted effects when combined with medications or anesthesia. You will receive instructions regarding managing your medications before surgery. Please Note: If you are experiencing pain prior to surgery, you are allowed Tylenol up to the day of your surgery.

Refrain from smoking six (6) weeks AFTER surgery. Nicotine hinders the healing process and the bone needs time to heal and to grow on the new implant. Smoking increases your risk for developing an infec - tion after surgery. Check with your surgeon or your personal physician if you are using medication to help you quit smoking such as a nicotine patch or gum. Call 860.892.6900 to find out when the next available \"Freedom from Smoking\" session is being held. Please be aware that smoking not allowed anywhere in the hospital and on the hospital campus. Alcohol NO alcohol 2 weeks prior to surgery . Also, please inform your healthcare team of any alcohol intake. Alcohol may interfere with certain medications you will be prescribed. Eliminating the alcohol you consume prior to surgery allows your body to heal better. Additionally, serious harm can result from alcohol withdrawal when not properly managed. Alcohol should be avoided after surgery until further advice from your provider . Dental Care If you need dental work (including routine dental cleanings), it is recommended to complete it at least two (2) weeks before surgery . Although infections in joint replacements are uncommon, infections can occur if bacteria enter the blood stream somewhere in your body. Therefore, you should arrange to have dental procedures such as extractions or dental work completed before surgery. After a joint replacement your surgeon or dentist may want you to take antibiotics before any future dental work. Most surgeons prefer that no dental work be done for three (3) months after surgery (excluding dental emergencies). Please discuss with your surgeon any specific questions you may have regarding dental care . Oral health is linked to overall health. It is important to brush your teeth and rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash at least two times a day before and after surgery. Marijuana (Medical or Recreational) Please stop all THC containing products 7 days prior to surgery unless otherwise instructed by your doctor. CBD topical products - do not use after your pre-surgical shower. Medical marijuana cannot be used during your time at the hospital. Do not use medical marijuana at the same time as prescription pain medication unless instructed to do so by your doctor . Nutrition Good nutrition is important before surgery . Eating healthy, well balanced meals, and avoiding any unnec - essary weight loss or gain prior to your procedure is recommended. This will help make sure you have the strength for recovery. If you are overweight, losing weight will help reduce the stress on your new joint . Exercise Keeping your muscles toned will help you to recover faster after surgery . Be sure to follow the exercise program you have been given by your doctor .13 Medications At your medical clearance, you will be told when to stop taking certain medications . Examples of medications and supplements you should stop taking are: Blood thinner like Aspirin Fish Oil, Flax, Vitamin E At your medical clearance, you may be told to take additional medication . Your doctor or APRN may advise you to take iron (Ferrous Sulfate) and Folic Acid for at least four weeks prior to surgery and two weeks after. This may boost the minerals needed for new blood productions by your body. A stool softener, such as Colace, may be required daily. Consult your physician for the type of iron and appropriate dose of vitamin supplements and stool softeners. You will be given medication for five days should you test positive for Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This is done in abundance of precaution. At your medical clearance, please be honest about your tobacco, drug and alcohol use . It is important for your surgical team to know the truth about your tobacco, drug and alcohol use as it can impact your anesthesia, pain management, and recovery. Drug abuse and excessive use of prescription pain medications can make it difficult to manage your pain after surgery. Home Planning and Preparation It is a good idea to prepare your home for your hospital discharge BEFORE you go to the hospital. The pread - missions team at Hartford HealthCare at Home will call you before surgery to discuss how home care will assist with your recovery and expectations from home care after surgery, the best plan for your recovery at home, insurance benefits, and services and equipment suggested for after surgery. This information will be shared with your surgical team at Backus Hospital in order to optimize the care you receive while you recover in the hospital as well as provide a smooth transition home .14 Preparing Your Home Before Surgery It's important that you or someone in your family makes sure the house is ready for your return home after shoulder surgery. Your safety and comfort is of upmost importance for your recovery. You should: Ask for help. Plan to have a family member or friend stay with you for the first two to seven days after you return home. Make needed modifications and check with your insurance plans. You may need to install grab bars in the bathroom or railings to the entrance of your house or the stairs inside your home. Some changes to your home may be covered by insurance. Put things in reach. Make sure items you use often are at arm level so you don't have to bend or reach high to get them. Rearrange furniture. You need room to move around your house. Remove tripping hazards. Tidy and remove clutter. Ensure throw rugs are removed and electrical cords do not obstruct hallways and walkthroughs. Create a command center. Arrange a sitting area with a nearby table that enables easy access to things you often use like the phone, television remote, water, reading materials and medications. Get a good chair. It should have a firm seat that is high enough for you to get out of easily. Make sure it has armrests that you can push on as you get up. Choose loose fitting clothes. Movement is important after surgery and loose clothes won't restrict you or rub your incision. Check your bathroom size. Ensure that you can move in the bathroom. Decide where you will sleep. Initially after surgery, you may want to sleep in a recliner chair for comfort.15 Post-Hospital Plan Your post-hospital plan will be discussed during your PATC visit or with your surgeon prior to your hospital admission. Your care management team will provide you with a list of choices for you to select a home health care agency, or in rare cases, a skilled nursing facility to support your successful transition from Backus Hospital. We have a network of preferred providers that collaborate with Backus Hospital to provide seamless orthopedic aftercare. If you require follow-up services, your care management team will work with you to arrange your care needs. Discharge Transportation Transportation options include: Family member or friend A wheelchair van can be arranged by a nurse case coordinator, however, it is not typically covered by insurance and may require an out of pocket cost. On rare occasions, you may be transferred to a preferred provider Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) post dis - charge. Transportation to a SNF can be by a family member or friend or via wheelchair van (not typically covered by insurance) or ambulance (only paid for by insurance with a certificate of medical need). Discharge Information If you are staying overnight in the hospital our goal is for patients to be ready for a safe transition home by 11 am the day after their surgery. This targeted time line is also individualized based on patient circumstances. All patients must meet their individual physical therapy safety goals and be medically cleared by their medical or surgical team before transitioning home .The NIGHT BEFORE your surgery you will shower and do the following: Nail polish and acrylic (non-natural) nails must be removed prior to surgery. Follow instructions on next page for CHG Cloths use.

ERAS aims to: Minimize pain with the use of non-narcotic medications Improve outcomes from your surgery Reduce complications like post-operative nausea and vomiting and dizziness from low blood pressure and dehydration Allow for earlier return of eating of food and activity Reduce the length of time during your hospital stay Return to your baseline health and normal daily activities19 The Night Before Your Surgery It is important to drink plenty of fluids before and after your surgery. You should not eat any solid foods or milk products (including gum or candy) after MIDNIGHT the night before your surgery. You may be told that you can drink clear liquids (liquids you can see through like water) after midnight until one (1) hour before your arrival time for surgery. If you are told you can drink clear liquids after midnight, you will also need to drink 16 ounces of apple juice or Gatorade one hour before your scheduled time of arrival at the hospital. This will be the last liquid you drink before surgery. Unless you are told this, you must not eat or drink anything after midnight. Clear Liquid Beverages Allowed: Includes water, coffee, tea (no milk or creamers), strained fruit juices with no pulp (apple juice, grape juice, cranberry juice). Gatorade, Crystal Light, iced tea, lemonade. Chicken or beef bouillon/broth, Jell-O (no fruit or toppings), popsicles (no sherbets, no fruit bars).

They will manage your orthopedic care during your hospitalization and in the office. Hospitalists: Hospitalists are internal medicine physicians, or nurse practitioners who specialize in seeing patients only in the hospital. Hospitalists have the same training as other internal medicine doctors including medical school, residency training, and board certifications. A hospitalist may be included to assist in managing any medical concerns during your hospital stay. Physician Assistants (PAs): These are healthcare professionals who practice under the supervision of a physician. When your surgeon is not available for immediate hands-on care, the PA will round daily on patients to assist with medication adjustments, dressing changes, and test-result monitoring. They will communicate with the orthopedists on patient care needs. Anesthesia Team: This team is responsible for safely administering and monitoring anesthesia during surgery and in the recovery room. They will monitor you during your postoperative care for any issues related to anesthesia. The anesthesia team also includes APRNs. Nurses: Nurses are essential to care in the recovery of all patients after surgery in both the recovery room same day surgery and on the orthopedic floor after surgery. They have expertise in the care of orthopedic patients. Patient Care Technician: Under the direction of a licensed nurse, the patient care technician performs vital sign monitoring and provides bathing and toileting assistance. Physical Therapists/Occupational Therapists: Physical Therapists are trained to teach patients and families how to walk and exercise after surgery to regain mobility and improve overall physical strength and ability. Occupational Therapists work with you to ensure you can accomplish daily activities like bathing and dressing with any physical limitations during the recovery process. Both will ensure you follow any activity precautions you may have as directed by your surgeon. Case Management: These are licensed staff that assist in the planning, coordination, and monitoring of medical services for the patient with emphasis on quality of care, continuity of services and cost effectiveness. Orthopedic Nurse Navigators: Our orthopedic nurse navigators will be in contact with you prior to surgery, throughout the process, and then after your surgical procedure. Your navigator is there as a resource for you; please do not hesitate to call with any questions before, during or after your hospital stay.22 It's Surgery Time Arrival Arrive at the hospital on time. When you speak with the Backus Hospital clinical team member the day before your surgery, they will let you know when to arrive on the day of your surgery. Our team is ready to make sure you're comfortable and well-informed throughout the entire process . Upon Arrival You will enter the hospital through the Emergency Care Entrance. Please proceed to the purple elevators on the left and go up to the 1st floor. You will check in at the Same Day Surgery (SDS) registration desk and a member of the healthcare team will bring you to the SDS care area to change into a hospital gown. Your clothing and personal belongings will be safely stored. Reminder: Please leave all valuables at home. Your family/friend may be asked to wait in the waiting room while the nurse prepares you for surgery. Your preoperative team member will ask questions, take vital signs, perform a physical assessment and start your intravenous (IV) that will be used to administer fluids and medications. Only one (1) family member/friend will be allowed to join you in the pre-operative area while you wait to go to surgery but that individual must be at least 18 years old. Your surgical site will be identified and marked prior to your surgery. Communicate to your surgeon who you have designated to be your advocate after surgery and how to reach that person. With your permission, the provider will contact this person with updates. Anesthesia There are several choices of anesthetic techniques that may be chosen for shoulder surgery. You and your anesthesiologist will discuss all necessary factors prior to surgery and agree upon a plan for your anesthetic . You will be closely monitored by your anesthesia team throughout your entire procedure. General Anesthesia This type of anesthesia affects the whole body and you are completely unaware of your surroundings. This type of anesthesia requires a breathing tube to be inserted to support you throughout the procedure. Regional Anesthesia This is a technique that will anesthetize a particular area or region of the body. You will not be awake during surgery. Duration of Surgery Your surgery will last approximately 1-2 hours .23 Peripheral Nerve Block What is a peripheral nerve block? A nerve block puts a part of your body to sleep by making it \"numb\". It is a way to block the signals that travel along the nerves. The nerve block does this by keeping the pain sensation from reaching the brain. Why do I need a peripheral nerve block? Surgeries, especially orthopedic surgeries, can be painful. Postoperative pain can limit or slow your recovery by making it difficult for you to participate in physical therapy, walk, go to the bathroom etc. Peripheral nerve blocks work together with other pain medications (opioids, muscle relaxers, anti-inflammatories, etc.) to provide optimal pain control. The goal is to provide the best possible pain relief with the least opioid use. Your surgeon and anesthesia team may suggest a peripheral nerve block to control the sensation of pain during and after your surgery. The nerve block is used in addition to standard anesthesia which will keep you sleeping during the surgery. 24 What happens when the block wears off? We strongly advise patients to take pain medication before the block completely wears off to help ease the transition. The block may last 24-36 hours. The block may wear off suddenly or gradually. You may feel tingling sensations before the block starts to wear off. Once the block has worn off, you should stay ahead of the pain. See the medication list for instructions on which medications to take. When should I be concerned? If you continue to feel the effects of the peripheral nerve block for longer than 48 hours, please contact your surgeons office.25 After Surgery Your Hospital Stay Recovery - Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU): The Post-Anesthesia Care Unit is also referred to as PACU. After your surgery you will be brought to the PACU in a hospital bed, where you will be closely monitored as anesthesia wears off. The anesthesia staff and nurses will monitor your vital signs like blood pressure, pulse, breathing, temperature and manage your pain. These staff members will monitor any other issue that may arise. During this time you may also have a physical therapist work with you for the first time. The length of stay in the PACU will be determined by many factors including the type of procedure and the anesthetic used. You may be in the PACU between 1-2 hours. Transfer to your Hospital Room You will be transferred to your assigned medical-surgical orthopedic room which is when your support person is encouraged to visit. Our goal is to have you up and moving within 4 (four) hours of the recovery room. The physical therapists and nursing staff will help get you out of bed. You will have a bandage over the surgical site, and the intravenous catheter in your arm will still be in place to administer fluids and medications post-operatively. Your care team will monitor your progress throughout your hospital stay to ensure a safe and speedy recovery. They will continue to check your vital signs and manage your pain. Transfer to Same Day Surgery If your surgery will be a same day surgery, you will be transferred to Same Day Surgery from the recovery room. Here family members are able to join you. Our goal is to have you up and moving within 4 (four) hours of the recovery room. The physical therapists and nursing staff will help get your out of bed. They will assist you in getting ready to go home. A beverage and possibly something light to eat will be offered. Discharge instructions will be given to you and your support person verbally and a written copy will be sent home with you. 26 Pain Management: Keeping You Comfortable You will experience pain following surgery. However, we will work with you to help manage your pain appropriately. If you are in pain or have discomfort, please tell us. We want to help you to feel comfortable. Good pain control is a partnership between you and your caregivers. Managing your pain will help you recover more quickly . Our Goals Develop a pain relief plan Decrease pain to a level that is tolerable Determine if pain medication is needed and the appropriate amount Develop a plan to transition you off of narcotic pain medication Pain Assessment To help us minimize your pain after surgery you will be asked to rate the intensity and type of your pain through the use of a pain scale of 0-10. 0 is no pain, 10 is excruciating pain Knowing that after surgery 0 is not attainable, a score between 4-5 is an attainable and acceptable score for most patients. It is best if you take the pain medication when your pain level starts to rise. DO NOT allow your pain to get severe. If you maintain pain control, it takes less medication and less time to manage the pain. Some of the best non-medication pain management techniques include deep breathing, listening to music/distraction, and using ice near the incision. 1-2 0 3-4 5-6 7-8 9-10 Pain is present but does not limit activityCan do most activities with rest periodsUnable to do some activities because of painUnable to do most activities because of painUnable to do any activities because of painPain Scale (0-10)27 What to Do When You are in Pain Your nurse will assess you to be sure your pain relief plan is working before and after an intervention for pain (such as pain medicine or an ice pack).

Breathing Exercises Breathing exercises are an important part of your recovery. After your surgery you will be encouraged to perform simple lung exercises like deep breathing and coughing after your surgery . Incentive Spirometer You will be given a device known as an Incentive Spirometer. A member of your care team will instruct you on how to use this device. It is best to use it 10 times every hour when awake for the first two weeks after surgery, even at home. This will help you to fully expand your lungs by breathing deeply and will prevent fluid collection, pneumonia and fevers . Blood Clot Prevention Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in a vein. The biggest danger is a clot that breaks off and travels to the lungs. This is called a Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and it can be life-threatening. Here are some of the signs of a blood clot: - DVT (clot in an arm or leg) - pain, swelling, warmth, numbness/tingling - PE (clot in the lungs) - difficulty breathing, chest pain, fast heart rate Walking is the key to blood clot prevention. Avoid sitting or lying in one position for long periods of time. It's important to get up and walk every hour to help prevent blood clots. Sequential Compression Device Also known as pneumatic compression stockings or \"pneumo-boots,\" these stockings inflate and deflate automatically via a pump at the end of the bed. They assist in the prevention of blood clots by squeezing your calves to help the blood in your legs continue circulating throughout your body. They are worn while you are in bed or sitting in a chair until you are walking frequently. These stockings will be used while you are in the hospital.29 Blood Clot Prevention Prevention of blood clotting is extremely important after joint replacement. Different medications are used for anticoagulation. Medication may be injected or taken by mouth, depending on the type of anticoagulation your surgeon orders. If you are on anticoagulation medication during your hospital stay, your surgeon will prescribe this medication or a substitute (such as aspirin), upon transition home. DO NOT stop taking your anticoagulation medication until directed by your doctor.30 Length of Stay for shoulder replacement Your hospital stay may be same-day surgery or one overnight stay. Mobility Mobility is Medicine Research has shown that early movement following surgery can decrease complications and help with decreasing pain. Expect that you will be moving (getting in and out of bed, going to bathroom, transferring to a chair) the same day of your surgery. Getting Started Mobility will begin on the day of surgery with a goal of 4 (hours) from the recovery room . You will receive a Physical Therapy evaluation and a customized therapy program. DO NOT get out of bed without the assistance of a healthcare team member for toileting or transfers until you are cleared to safely do so. It is best to take your pain medication PRIOR to your physical therapy session to allow better participation.Mobility Includes Transfers (includes car transfer training) Toileting Stair training Walking31 Transitioning Home Post-Hospital Plan Your post-hospital recovery begins the day you are discharged from the hospital and go home. For the first two weeks following surgery you will have a therapist team member come to your home. They will develop a therapy plan individualized for you. You will likely transition to outpatient physical therapy in two weeks. This is about the same time as your two week follow-up appointment with your surgeon. You will need to made appointments for outpatient physical therapy at the facility of your choosing. Contact your insurance provider to discuss any out-of-pocket expenses. Remember to regularly log into Force Therapeutics to complete your exercise program. Regular exercise is an important part of restoring your normal joint motion and strength, and plays a key role in returning you to your normal everyday activities. Your surgeon and therapist will develop a plan that is best for you. Care for Your Incision Monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection is very important. Our nursing team will educate you on proper incision site care. We pride ourselves on having low infection rates. Your surgical incision may be closed using sutures or staples. These will be removed in your surgeon's office about 2 (two) weeks after your surgery. Taking appropriate care of your wound helps to prevent infection. You can help by following these simple steps: Keep the area clean and dry Keep the area clean and dry. A dressing will be applied to the incision in the hospital and should be changed per your surgeon's instructions. How to do this and how often will be explained to you before you go home. If you are not sure how to do this, ask your surgeon or nurse. Your incision should remain dry and covered with a dressing until your follow up visit in 2 weeks when the staples or sutures are removed. Watch for changes Immediately notify your provider if the wound has redness that is spreading, appears more warm, or begins to drain liquid. Remember that some swelling is expected for the first 3 (three) to 6 (six) months after surgery. Infection Prevention The most important thing you can do to prevent infection is to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand cleanser frequently and before changing the dressing over your incision. Be very careful handling your pets until your incision is healed. Wash your hands after touching your pets to prevent infection. Support your body's ability to fight infection by eating a healthy diet and drinking plenty of healthy fluids like water. Contact your primary care physician if you think you may have an infection elsewhere.32 Dressings Your surgeon will determine the appropriate surgical dressing for you. Aquacel Surgical Dressing The incision should remain dry and covered with a dressing until the staples or sutures are removed at the two week follow-up appointment. Keep the Aquacel dressing in place for 10(ten) days as long as it is clean, dry, and intact. Drainage in the center is okay. The dressing should be changed if drainage is leaking out the side. A gauze dressing should be applied and changed per surgeon's instructions. Leave skin glue alone, let it release on its own. No creams, powders, oils or lotions to the incision or area around it. Do not scrub, soak or submerge your incision in water until cleared by your doctor. Surgical Dressing The incision should remain dry and covered until the staples or sutures are removed at the two week follow-up appointment. Dressings should be changed per surgeon's instructions - usually every day. No creams, powders, oils or lotions to the incision or area around it. Do not scrub, soak or submerge your incision in water until cleared by doctor. Showering/Bathing You may shower following your surgeons instructions.. When you are able to shower, DO NOT rub the incision. Cover the dressing with a protective wrap while showering until told the incision can get wet by your surgeon. NO tub baths, hot tubs, spas, lakes, ocean or pools until your surgeon has confirmed your wound has healed enough to do so. You may shower with your Aquacel dressing on but do NOT remove dressing.33 Exercise Please follow the exercise plan that your surgeon and physical therapist have established for you. Your recovery process and continued health depends on good nutrition, rest and proper exercise. Most shoulder patients experience a reduction in joint pain and an increased ability to participate in the activities of daily living within 2(two) to 3(three) weeks after surgery. Recovery takes time. Expect to feel a bit more tired than usual for the first few weeks. Allow yourself plenty of time to regain your strength and self-confidence. Stay active-just don't overdo it. Monitor your own health on a daily basis to ensure your recovery is continuing as planned. You are the best person to notice changes in your body and should inform your doctors if needed. Ice Therapy Begin using an ice machine or ice pack immediately after surgery. Icing is very important for the first 7 days after surgery. Apply the ice therapy while awake during the day, 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off. Care must be taken with icing to avoid frost bite to the skin. Do NOT apply ice directly to the skin. Do NOT apply ice at night. Diet Anesthetic drugs used during surgery may cause nausea for the first 24 hours. If nausea is encountered, drink only clear liquids and eat only light foods (Jell-O, soups, dry crackers, toast). You may have been given a prescription medication for nausea (Zofran). If so, you may take that medication as directed. If you are not nauseated, progress to a normal diet as tolerated. Constipation To avoid constipation, drink water 64 oz per day unless you have a fluid restriction. Eat foods with a high fiber content such as beans, broccoli, carrots, celery, fruits (apples, blueberries, prunes, dates, pears, citrus), oatmeal, whole grains, and nuts. You were prescribed Senokot to prevent constipation. Take it as directed. Take Miralax or generic brand of Miralax over the counter if you do not have a bowel movement by four pm every day. 34 Nutrition Guidelines After your procedure you may experience constipation. Fluid and fiber have been the foundation for treatment of constipation. You should gradually increase your fiber and fluid intake over the course of your recovery. Fluid Needs When increasing your fiber intake you must also increase your fluid intake! Otherwise it could potentially make your constipation symptoms worse. Many people will want some more variety in their fluids instead of plain water. If a beverage contains flavoring it may cause you to drink more. Try the list below to increase your fluids daily: It is recommend to keep a water bottle with you most of the time, so that you will drink more fluids. Remember the old saying: \"out of sight out of mind\" that holds true for fluid intake too.How Much Fiber Do I Need Fluids Other Than WaterMen 30-38 grams per day Smoothies Non-calorie additives (ex. Crystal Light, Hint, Bai etc.) Low calorie Sports Drinks (<50 calories /serving) Electrolyte Beverages (Propel, NUUN tablets, etc.) Fruit Infused WaterWomen 20-25 grams per day 35 Foods with Fiber Here is a list of variety of foods with fiber. When in doubt look at the nutrition facts label to see how much fiber is in each product. We are aiming for at least 3-5 grams of fiber per serving. Pick and choose from the list below to meet your fiber needs!

Some patients are discharged home with a prescription for injections to prevent blood clots. It is important that you or a family member learn how to perform these injections prior to leaving the hospital. Home care will not come to your home every day for every dose. You must learn how to perform these injections. Remind your surgeon of any medications you were on before your surgery, that were not prescribed for you after your surgery. Remember to check with your surgeon before you begin taking any over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, and/or supplements. Please get all of your medications filled at the same pharmacy so that your pharmacist can properly identify harmful medication interactions. Ask your pharmacist questions you may have regarding your medications and associated side effects. Other Important Information Swelling is not uncommon after shoulder surgery. Ice is helpful in decreasing swelling. It is essential that you inform your dentist that you have had a shoulder replacement, as you may need prophylactic antibiotics prior to having your teeth cleaned or other dental procedures. If you have any surgical procedures following your shoulder replacement, inform the physician that you have an implant. Don't Forget It is important that you fully understand your transitional care plan to ensure your continued healing, safety, and comfort. You will receive these instructions in writing before you leave the hospital. Before you leave the hospital ask questions about all of your medications and be sure you know what medications are being prescribed, the proper dosage, how and when to take the medication, and possible side effects. Be informed about your health condition (ask the care team if you do not understand any information shared with you) and what you can do to help your recovery. NO driving while on narcotic pain medication and return to driving will be decided by your surgeon. Your instructions may include your follow-up appointments with your orthopedic surgeon and/or other specialists or your primary care physician. If you do not have a follow-up appointment with your surgeon, please make one as soon as you return home.37 Follow-up Phone Call Your health and recovery is very important to your care team.
