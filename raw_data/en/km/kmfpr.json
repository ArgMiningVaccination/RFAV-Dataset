Being a follower, preacher and practitioner of Ayurveda principles, he should live his life in the most authentic Ayurveda way right? So, it is wrong when an Ayurveda doctor takes Allopathic medicine. But wait. Ayurveda and Allopathy It is common for an Allopathic doctor to consider Ayurveda (and other natural medical sciences) as inferior. Similarly, whenever you see a naturopath talking about Allopathic science, he usually criticizes Allopathy to explain the advantages of the natural medical science. Hence there are some conceptions - that the natural medical sciences and Allopathy are at loggerheads with each other. - that any one among these two can exist in this world - that if someone is a naturopath, he has to be averse towards allopathy and vice versa - that one should not consume the medicine of the other science - that a naturopath should not use modern lab tests, ultrasound scans, MRI etc techniques and he should only stick to the ancient ways of diagnosing the disease. I think these concepts are quite restrictive. If we both (Ayurveda and Allopathy) decide to move in parallel roads, it will be a huge loss to mankind. Let me explain. Ayurveda has got advantages in diseases like kidney stones, rheumatoid disease (affecting joints and heart, degenerative disorders like arthritis, diabetes, lifestyle disorders like obesity, high cholesterol levels etc. Allopathy has got advantages in diseases like infectious conditions, surgical conditions, cardiac ailments etc. So both the systems have advantages and disadvantages. Both are specialized in their own areas and both can co-exist. If we adopt integrated approach involving both Ayurveda and allopathy, then it brings out the best of both worlds and the patient will be immensely benefited. Ayurveda doctor taking Allopathic medicine Whenever I get some illness, usually people ask me - Hey doc, you too get sick? Then I am like, - Don't barbers grow hair? If Ayurveda doctor falls sick and if he consults an Allopathic doctor and takes their medication, I do not see any problem there. If you have subscribed to my blog, you know my story. If I had not undergone a surgery at the hands of an allopathic surgeon (Dr Mahesh, Chief Surgeon, Nanjappa Hospital, Shimoga), I would have died at the age of 9. I know many Allopathic doctors seeking Ayurveda advice. I myself have many such clients from within India and abroad. I even have co ordination with some Allopathic doctors, whose patients seek natural remedies. I have seen many allopathic doctors prescribing selective Ayurveda medicines. Himalaya company (which is an Ayurveda company) medical representatives gets major chunk of their business by allopathic physicians. Day by day, the world is becoming smaller and the roads of Natural healing and allopathy are merging with each other. We need to become grown ups. We need to develop all-inclusive mentality.
