Blood collection in New Jersey is down more than 25 percent since late summer 2021, compounding the effect that COVID-19 lockdowns had on reducing donations in 2020. Similar trends are being seen nationwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on people's habits and daily lives, which in turn has had a significant impact on blood donations and collection across the country. Prior to the pandemic, high school and college blood drives supplied about 40 percent of donations throughout the country. Many drives have not returned to these levels, challenging the healthcare profession to keep up with demands for blood that have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Lifesaving blood is given to patients in a wide range of circumstances, including cancer care, trauma events such as car accidents and home accidents, childbirth and mass casualty events. Blood donors of all types are critically needed, especially type O, the universal blood type. Appointments are available Monday through Friday and select Saturdays at RWJUH Somerset's Blood Donor Room. To make an appointment to donate blood, please visit www.rwjuhdonorclub.org or call 908.685.2926 \"During the recent omicron surge, our healthcare workers went above and beyond during an extraordinarily difficult time.

The unit uses the latest research- and evidence-based design principles to simultaneously meet critical safety and security needs, enhance programming and promote healing and wellness. \"People with eating disorders often suffer from secondary mental health issues such as anxiety and depression on top of their primary disorder,\" says Christine Belluardo, Vice President, Behavioral Health Services, RWJUH Somerset. \"They're quite ill when they come to us.\"ACTIVE RECOVERY The program encourages recovery by helping patients develop inner resources such as understanding needs, identifying strengths and learning coping skills. \"Our hope is to provide a well-rounded treatment plan and experience so when people leave, they can continue to use what they've learned with support from our team or with help from a partial hospital program like the one at RWJUH Somerset,\" Belluardo says. Innovative elements that emphasize calming connections to nature have Understanding the balance of physical, mental and social needs in people with severe\u2014even life-threatening\u2014eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder has been the hallmark of treatment at the nationally recognized Eating Disorders Unit at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset for more than two decades.

It was recognized in October 2021 at the national Healthcare Design Expo and Conference, where representatives from NK Architects and DCC Design Group discussed the project's features. \"The patient rooms and entire milieu aesthetically contribute to an environment that promotes healing, wellness and recovery,\" Belluardo says. Key research-based design elements include features like these: Nature-Based Lighting Indoor lighting changes to correspond with the brightening and dimming of natural sunlight throughout the day. \"Attuning people to circadian, or daily, natural rhythms has been shown to be conducive to healing in behavioral health settings,\" Belluardo says. Relaxing Ambiance Structural and decorative lines throughout the facility are designed to be soft and calm-inducing, often by incorporating curves, which are more common in nature than straight lines or hard angles. References to Nature Spaces such as the reception area feature natural images and colors to evoke the relaxing quality of living environments. The unit's design concept also calls for direct patient access to dedicated garden spaces. Flexibility Many spaces are designed to meet a variety of needs and can accommodate a mix of uses such as active or quiet, open or private. The unit provides ample space for group activities that are key to the program's recovery-based treatment, which helps patients develop resilience and coping skills through methods such as mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Attractive Rooms The renovation expands the number of patient rooms from 14 to 20. Many rooms are private. Design elements such as natural lighting, soft lines and nature-evoking imagery follow patients into these private spaces. Age Separation RWJUH Somerset's unit is the only inpatient eating disorders program in New Jersey that separates adults and adolescents into distinct areas. \"Best practice is to not have those patients together,\" Belluardo says. \"Adults and adolescents have different programming needs and levels of group engagement.\"Design throughout the new Eating Disorders Unit incorporates features such as lighting that mimics daily changes in sunlight and soft, curving lines that foster a sense of relaxation. Imagery evokes natural themes that further promote calm, including on walls in the reception area and patient rooms, many of which are private. Spaces are designed to be flexible and adaptable to multiple uses.

Scarangello was familiar with pain: Years of dance can take a toll on the body. The orthopedic team at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset had treated her for multiple injuries, including a procedure to repair the meniscus cartilage of her knee. So when her hip pain continued, she turned to the hospital again. The assessment: \"I had no cartilage left in my hip at all,\" she says. Charles Gatt, MD, an orthopedic sports medicine specialist on staff at RWJUH Somerset, urged Scarangello to consider hip replacement surgery, but she wasn't ready. She figured surgery could sideline a dancing career. \"Being a ballet dancer, I was very resistant,\" she says. Scarangello decided to give steroid injections a try instead. She already received them in her toes, which also had lost cartilage over the years. The shots reduced her hip pain and helped her At 62, Patricia Scarangello, a ballet dancer and teacher in Aberdeen, lives an active life. She teaches at the New Jersey School of Ballet and works in TV and film, recently playing a dance instructor and choreographing a scene in the HBO miniseries \"The Undoing.\" But a few years ago, she started having pain in STEPHEN KAYIAROS, MD A minimally invasive approach to hip replacement relieved pain that once made movement difficult for Patricia Scarangello.

Procedures such as joint replacements will be even easier on patients when RWJUH Somerset completes a two-story addition containing a new orthopedic unit above the Pavilion building. Designed for safety and comfort, the unit will have more rooms for joint replacement patients and a state-of-the- art gym for rehabilitation. \"With the number of people undergoing joint replacement increasing exponentially, having an expansive orthopedic unit with ample private rooms will allow us to accommodate more patients and allow them to quickly get to their rooms and begin their road to recovery,\" Dr. Kayiaros says. Scarangello's prosthetic hip is expected to last at least 20 years. \"If I'm still kicking in 20 years,\" she says, \"I'll be doing it at the ballet barre.\" For more information about joint surgery services at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset, visit www.rwjbh.org/ortho.SAME QUALITY, NEW NAME: THE TOM NORDSTROM, MD, AND FAMILY JOINT CENTER OF EXCELLENCE Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset recently renamed its Joint Center of Excellence in honor of Thomas Nordstrom, MD, and family. For nearly four decades, Dr. Nordstrom was an orthopedic surgeon at the hospital, where he was former chief of orthopedic surgery. His wife, Sue, was an active member and past president of the hospital's former Auxiliary. The onetime Bridgewater residents, who now live in West Palm Beach, FL, recently made a significant donation to support the hospital's joint surgery program. Dr. Nordstrom and partners pioneered many firsts at RWJUH Somerset, and he was a driving force in the 2010 development of RWJUH Somerset's Joint Surgery Institute. The Institute standardized care, educated patients and introduced aggressive rehabilitation, among other innovations that improved patient outcomes. RWJUH Somerset has received the Joint Commission's Gold Seal of Approval for quality achievements in total hip and total knee replacement surgery. \"Dr. Nordstrom was instrumental in the growth of our orthopedic surgery program and elevating the quality of care that we provide to our patients,\" says Tony Cava, President and Chief Executive Officer, RWJUH Somerset. \"Sue's fundraising efforts over the years helped us modernize and expand our services to meet the needs of our community. We are extremely grateful for their continued support.\" From left: Paul Hubert, Chair, Somerset Health Care Foundation Board of Trustees; Kim Nordstrom; Sue Nordstrom; Thomas Nordstrom, MD; Donna Castronovo, Vice President, Somerset Health Care Foundation; Patrick Delaney, Chief Operating Officer, RWJUH Somerset; and Salvatore Moffa, MD, Chief Medical Officer, RWJUH Somerset.function better for periods of time. But those intervals of relief eventually became shorter and shorter. Pain became so bad that she couldn't find a comfortable sleep position. Dr. Gatt finally convinced Scarangello to see Stephen Kayiaros, MD, Medical Director of RWJUH Somerset's joint surgery program, who specializes in minimally invasive joint replacement. \"Even though she was pretty functional, she was limited in what she could do because of mobility issues and pain,\" Dr. Kayiaros says. \"She wanted to get her hip replaced to improve her quality of life, dance without pain and get back to the level of dancing she was used to.\" A MINIMALLY INVASIVE OPTION During hip replacement, surgeons switch the damaged ball and neck at the top of the thighbone (femur) and the socket of the pelvic bone with prosthetic parts to stop pain and improve movement. In traditional hip replacement, called the posterior approach, surgeons access the hip joint through an incision close to the buttocks. Dr. Kayiaros specializes in accessing the joint through incisions in the front, or anterior, hip area. This less-invasive anterior approach typically results in less pain and a lower risk of complications such as dislocation of the joint. These advantages sold Scarangello. \"They don't have to cut through muscle or connective tissue with the anterior approach,\" she says. \"Because of the way they position the hip, they can just move muscle aside so it doesn't have to heal as much.\" \"Typically patients who have an arthritic hip have a stiff joint and limited mobility,\" Dr. Kayiaros says. \"Patricia was quite the opposite, with good flexibility. She wanted to maintain her flexibility after surgery and was an ideal candidate for the anterior approach.\" ROAD TO RECOVERY Scarangello found her October 2021 surgery and recovery remarkably manageable. \"It was virtually painless,\" she says. She took nothing stronger than Tylenol while healing. Anterior hip replacement patients usually resume normal activities relatively quickly, Dr. Kayiaros says.

Tributes describe Betty's decades of philanthropy and service along with a bright, joyful personality marked by an exuberant smile, infectious laugh, self- deprecating wit, humble outlook and endless curiosity. Together, the Roswells became renowned for their generosity and community engagement. Art, now retired, holds a doctorate in metallurgic engineering from Yale University, worked in engineering management and has held numerous board positions in both industrial and community organizations. The couple has financially supported and served a wide range of causes throughout Central New Jersey, the nation and the world, including numerous organizations and initiatives reflecting the Roswells' deep commitment to Judaism. Upon her death, Betty also made a substantial bequest to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset. \"Over many years, the Roswells have been very philanthropic and generous with RWJUH Somerset,\" says Donna Castronovo, Vice President, Foundation and Development, Somerset Health Care Foundation. \"Planned giving is visionary support that indicates donors have thought carefully and consider the hospital very important to them. The Roswells have been among our most consistent and generous donors, and we are extremely grateful for their affinity, generosity and service.\" HISTORY OF GIVING To Art, being generous is important but unremarkable. \"Both Betty and I were brought up that way,\" he says. \"Giving was part of our families from way back.\" Past support for RWJUH Somerset has funneled through the Blaustein Philanthropic Group, a constellation of multigenerational family foundations in which Betty held a board position. But the couple's connections to RWJUH Somerset are personal as well as philanthropic. \"Two of our daughters were born at this hospital,\" Art says. \"Betty had some heart problems, and her cardiologist at the hospital impressed me. It became our family hospital, and that led me to want to become more involved.\" Their affinity grew through positive impressions the hospital made on Art as he became increasingly engaged in leadership. Early on, he noted that the hospital was forward-thinking about the importance of advance directives, especially in end-of-life situations. \"I was very pleased that our hospital did a good job with those,\" Art says. He was also impressed by the hospital's emphasis on having board-certified doctors. Art has served on numerous RWJUH Somerset boards, including those of the hospital and the Somerset Health Care Foundation, where he maintains an emeritus post, along with a wide variety of committees. \"As part of their philanthropy and service, the Roswells have contributed to all manner of events at the hospital,\" Castronovo says. \"From ground breakings and ribbon cuttings to large community gatherings like the long-running Music at Moorland event, if they could be there, they were. A hospital needs that kind of support, and the Roswells have been wonderful ambassadors for RWJUH Somerset.\" \"The Roswells have been thoughtful, lifelong supporters of RWJUH Somerset, and we're honored that they provided for the hospital in their estate plan,\" says Greg Ellmer, Vice President of Gift Planning. \"Forward-thinking gifts like these help to ensure that future generations will have access to extraordinary healthcare.\" A PLANNED GIFT HIGHLIGHTS ONE COUPLE'S LONGTIME COMMITMENT TO RWJUH SOMERSET.GIVING RELATIONSHIP Betty and Art Roswell's longtime support includes a bequest to the hospital upon Betty's death in 2020.

If you or a loved one needs treatment for cancer, here's what you should know: FACT #1 You don't have to travel to a nearby city, such as New York or Philadelphia, to access a clinical trial. As New Jersey's only National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, together with RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH), offers a wide range of clinical trials, many of which aren't available elsewhere. Patients may participate in a clinical trial either at an RWJBH hospital near where they live or at Rutgers Cancer Institute. \"We've integrated cancer care so that we're putting the standards and expertise of an NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, as well as clinical trials, in all 12 hospitals in the RWJBH system,\" says Howard Hochster, MD, FACP, Director, Oncology Research for RWJBH, and Associate Director, Clinical Research, for Rutgers Cancer Institute. FACT #2 Clinical trials have led to significant advances in treatment. Treatments developed through these trials have helped tens of thousands of patients. For example, Rutgers Cancer Institute: Was the first to offer trials with specific immunotherapy drugs that worked for many skin cancers, especially Merkel cell carcinoma. Participated in a trial for a first- line colon cancer treatment that led to excellent responses for a number of patients, making them eligible for potentially curative surgery. Has pioneered immunotherapy treatments resulting in better management of many cancers, including renal cell cancer and bladder cancer. \"When I started out treating colon cancer 25 years ago, we had only one drug available, and it dated back to the 1960s,\" says Dr. Hochster. \"Since that time, we've developed three new chemotherapy drugs and five new targeted drugs for colon cancer, and all of them were developed through clinical trials. Now people are living with colon cancer, on average, four times as long as they used to.\" FACT #3 Clinical trials are not a last resort. \"It's important for people to understand that enrolling in a clinical trial is often an option for a first-line or early treatment,\" says Dr. Hochster. \"These trials are a way for us to give patients the latest treatments before they're widely available. They offer tomorrow's treatments today.\" To determine whether a patient would be best suited for a clinical trial or for standard care, each individual case is evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of cancer experts from throughout RWJBH and Rutgers Cancer Institute. Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBH currently offer approximately 270 different clinical trials.

Her son took her to the emergency department, where an electrocardiogram determined that there was a problem with the electrical signals in her heart. The next morning, doctors implanted a pacemaker. \"Her diagnosis was clearly aided by her having an Apple Watch,\" says the woman's cardiologist, Gary Rogal, MD, Medical Director for RWJBarnabas Health Cardiovascular Services and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. \"I believe wearable digital devices that measure heart rhythm will become a major addition to the diagnostic tool kit for cardiologists.\" Who should wear one of these devices? The short answer: people whose doctors recommend it. \"Wearable cardiac devices are very handy tools, but you have to be selective about how you use them,\" says Dr. Rogal. THE HEART'S RHYTHM The main value of wearable cardiac technology lies in its ability to detect cardiac arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, Dr. Rogal explains. These \"Call your doctor,\" said the message on the 87-year-old woman's Apple Watch. A regular walker and exerciser, the woman wasn't feeling right, so she'd PARTHO SENGUPTA, MD GARY ROGAL, MD LISTENING TO YOUR HEART RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 11 Healthy Together | 10 10System_CardiacWearables_Spr22_final_10.5.indd 10 3/4/22 3:21 PM3/4/22 electrical signals that coordinate the heart's beats don't work properly. In turn, the heart can't pump blood effectively. Symptoms of arrhythmia include a fluttering in the chest, shortness of breath, fainting, dizziness or a feeling that the heart is racing or beating too slowly. The symptoms may be brief or long-lasting, and they can indicate a condition that's anywhere from harmless to life-threatening. \"If I'm concerned about arrhythmia based on what the patient is telling me, but just can't nail down the diagnosis, I might suggest that a patient use a wearable cardiac device,\" says Dr. Rogal. \"The decision should be made along with a physical exam and a knowledge of the patient's medical history and symptoms. If there's no real reason to have one, wearing the device could do nothing more than make a patient anxious.\" NEW TOOLS An early form of wearable cardiac technology, the Holter monitor, has been around for decades. This device uses electrodes (small, plastic patches on the skin) to record the electrical activity of the heart. \"A patient can wear a Holter monitor for 24 to 48 hours or even longer,\" Dr. Rogal explains. \"The reality is, though, that some patients have arrhythmias once every few weeks or even every few months, and a Holter monitor could miss that,\" he says. \"That's the type of thing a smartwatch would pick up.\" Dozens of wearable devices are on the market today. Examples include: KardiaMobile, a pocket-sized portable EKG machine that allows patients to put their fingers on sensors and share the results with their doctor. The MCOT Patch System, which monitors the heart rhythm for two weeks via a sensor on the patient's chest. Other digital cardiac devices, which must be implanted by a physician, are also coming into wider use. Examples include: A device called CardioMEMS, which monitors pulmonary artery pressure and sends the results to a team of clinicians. A loop recorder, a device smaller than a USB flash drive, that's placed just underneath the skin near the breastbone. It can continuously record a patient's heart rhythm for up to three years. \"If a patient calls me and says, 'Hey, I'm feeling funny, a little lightheaded,' I can interrogate the loop recorder and see what the heart rhythm was during that symptom,\" says Dr. Rogal. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE The key to the success of these technologies lies in artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014the ability of a computer to compare an individual's data against that of thousands of other patients and flag information that may be significant. \"AI allows information to be provided to the care team in a very nuanced way,\" says Partho Sengupta, MD, Chief of the Cardiology Service Line at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) and Chief of the Division of Cardiology at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. \"The device will only send an alert if it thinks the data is moving in the wrong direction and the patient is not doing well, as opposed to a steady stream of data, which can be overwhelming.\" The cardiology team at RWJUH meets regularly with doctors in the community to discuss the digital transformation of cardiology and consider innovations for treatment. Dr. Sengupta and his colleagues are conducting several clinical trials, including one for an armband that can monitor multiple physiological signals and offer personalized recommendations for a patient's care. \"For the future of cardiology, our overall concept is that care starts in the patient's home and ends at home, with the hospital and the clinic only points along the way,\" Dr. Sengupta says. \"In order for us to connect the whole journey, we need to have the ability to continuously monitor a patient's health. \"It's like how we use a GPS to help us on a road journey,\" he says. \"Now it's time to take that approach and apply it to our health journeys.\" Whoever your heart beats for, our hearts beat for you.

When the second one hit, crowds of people looked frantically for a way out of lower Manhattan. \"We were the first boat to start evacuating,\" Moyet recalls. \"We were facing a stampede.\" He worked until 3 a.m. the next day, transporting people away from danger. For the next year and a half, he continued to work in the Ground Zero area, shuttling federal agents, policemen, firemen and workers from throughout the country to lower Manhattan. Some two decades later, Moyet himself needed help. In January 2018, he sought care for what he thought was a severe cold with a cough that wouldn't stop. \"My doctor told me it was COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease],\" he says. Long- term lung problems are an unfortunate reality for many 9/11 first responders, who breathed in massive amounts of smoke, dust and fumes. On Sept. 11, 2001, Tony Moyet began his workday the same way as he had for the previous five years, by transporting about 300 commuters per trip from Hoboken to the World Financial Center in Manhattan on a NY Waterway ferry. \"That morning, though, when I dropped off a set of passengers, I saw the gaping hole in the North Tower, with flames coming out of it,\" Moyet recalls. \"I radioed [then NY Waterway port captain] Michael McPhillips and told him to send boats down in case we THE FREEDOM TO BREATHE THIRUVENGADAM ANANDARANGAM, MD JESUS GOMEZ-ABRAHAM, MD Two decades after 9/11, double lung transplant recipient Tony Moyet visits the NY Waterway ferry.

By spring 2020, he had developed end- stage COPD/emphysema and end-stage advanced pulmonary disease. He needed inhaled oxygen 24 hours a day; he couldn't climb stairs or sleep without it. \"He told me, 'Doc, I just need two more years to see my daughter graduate from high school,'\" says pulmonologist Thiruvengadam Anandarangam, MD, Division Chief, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBI). \"I told him that we're hoping we can give him enough time to see her graduate and also to walk her down the aisle someday.\" Moyet's best hope to extend his life was a double lung transplant. \"At the time, he was on 17 medications and medical management wasn't providing any more relief,\" says transplant surgeon Jesus Gomez-Abraham, MD, Associate Surgical Director of Lung Transplantation at NBI and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. Dr. Gomez-Abraham added Moyet to the lung transplant database on Friday, July 2. While the average lung transplant patient waits four months for a match, and even longer when a double lung transplant is required, Moyet's care team found his match the very next day. \"That was amazing\u2014 very unusual,\" Dr. Anandarangam says. \"He was listed on Friday. On Saturday, we found a donor in a neighboring state. I traveled there to look at the organs, and they matched Tony's size and blood type perfectly.\" On Sunday, July 4, Dr. Gomez-Abraham performed the double lung transplant. Eighteen days later, Moyet returned home. BREATHING EASIER His fast recovery, say his doctors, was driven by his determination to get better. \"When I saw him just before the transplant, he was already in better shape than the last time I had seen him,\" Dr. Gomez-Abraham says. \"He had done what he needed to do to improve his nutrition, and was doing pulmonary rehabilitation and physical therapy to increase his chance of better results.\" Moyet credits his caregivers at NBI for their guidance and persistence. \"After the transplant, I had to learn to walk and move all over again,\" he says. \"My nurses pushed me to keep going, even on days I didn't want to walk. They were dressed in blue; I called them my Blue Angels. They're the sweetest people in the world.\" Just two months after his double lung transplant, Moyet, 65, was taking walks again with his wife, Arlene, and 15-year- old daughter, Sophia. \"I don't need oxygen, and my lungs are working great,\" he says.

SPECIAL CARE FOR SERIOUS LUNG PROBLEMS People with the most complex lung conditions rely on the Advanced Lung Disease and Transplant Program at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBI), the only lung transplant program in New Jersey. Who is a candidate for a lung transplant? \"The majority of patients have end-stage COPD and emphysema,\" says Jesus Gomez-Abraham, MD. \"Other possible candidates are those with cystic fibrosis or pulmonary fibrosis as well as those with certain congenital cardiac diseases.\" Candidates at NBI are evaluated through a multidisciplinary approach that includes surgeons, pulmonologists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists and others. What is life like after a lung transplant? \"Patients will increase their lung function capacity up to 60 to 90 percent,\" says Dr. Gomez-Abraham. \"Once the transplant has settled in, the majority of patients do not need oxygen. They can go to the mall, go to the beach, go to the family reunion, go back to work. The lung transplantation gives them the freedom to develop a normal life.\" To learn more about transplant services at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/lungtransplant.

Initial tests may include blood work, an electrocardiogram and more. The patient will also undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he or she is a candidate for one of the program's levels of treatment: Inpatient treatment in a 14-bed unit that offers psychological, medical, nursing and nutritional care. Partial hospitalization, up to five days a week, with three hours of therapy per day. Intensive outpatient services, up to three days a week, with three hours of therapy per day. The program offers weekly support groups for patients and for family and friends. \"Our programs are in- person, not virtual, because that human interaction is so important in connecting with patients,\" Corey says. \"So many people tell us, 'I just don't want to talk to a computer screen.'\"To learn more about RWJUH Somerset's nationally recognized Eating Disorders Program, call 800.300.0628 or visit www.rwjbh.org/eatingdisorders.Being quarantined at home, not being in school for extended periods, not seeing friends or playing organized sports: The restrictions of the pandemic have been keenly felt by adolescents. Pandemic-related stressors seem to be behind a recent dramatic increase in reported symptoms of eating disorders\u2014 binging, purging, drastically reduced caloric intake\u2014as well as a doubling of hospitalizations for those issues. \"The kids we're seeing are much more medically compromised and much more entrenched in the behaviors than we've seen in the past,\" says Lynn Corey, LCSW, CEDS/S, CETP, Clinical Manager of Behavioral Health Outpatient Services at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset. \"The pandemic has made the eating disorders worse, because so much of teens' lives feels out of their control,\" explains Corey, who works with the RWJUH Somerset Eating Disorders Program. \"An eating disorder is really not about food; it's a maladapted coping mechanism. Food becomes used as a means of giving themselves power over their lives. \"Moreover,\" Corey continues, \"when teens aren't in school, there are fewer eyes on them\u2014school nurses, guidance counselors and teachers\u2014to notice changes and collaborate with parents.\" GETTING HELP If a parent is worried about a child's eating habits, a trip to the primary care provider is a good first step, Corey says. \"If the pediatrician feels things aren't looking good, that can open the door for parents to set up an evaluation with our program.\" Thanks to its hospital affiliation, the RWJUH Somerset program is COPING WITH EATING DISORDERS: TIPS FOR FAMILIES Express honest affection, verbally and physically. Teach children to communicate with assertiveness so they can resist inappropriate messages from their peers, the media and others about weight. Do not demand weight gain or berate a family member. Develop a dialogue about personal issues other than food and weight. Get support and educate yourself through books, professional help and talking with other families. CASES HAVE BEEN ON THE RISE DURING THE PANDEMIC, ESPECIALLY AMONG TEENS. OVERCOMING EATING DISORDERS Healthy Together | 14 | Spring Hospital, we provide world-class care for children and young adults who face special health challenges across the state of New Jersey and beyond. We treat everything from chronic illnesses and complex physical disabilities, like brain and spinal cord injuries, to a full scope of developmental, behavioral and mental health concerns. We have convenient locations throughout the state: Bayonne, Clifton, East Brunswick, Egg Harbor Township, Hamilton, Jersey City, Monmouth, New Brunswick, Newark, Somerset, Toms River, Union and West Orange.When the youngest son of Todd and Jackie Frazier was hospitalized briefly, his parents got a window into what parents of patients at Children's Specialized Hospital (CSH) go through. \"We understand that every day your child is not well, you're waiting for that bit of good news, for your child to make progress from the day before,\" says Todd, a local Toms River legend and Major League Baseball All-Star. \"When we visited Children's Specialized, we were able to see that everyone on the staff at the hospital is so passionate about caring for these children.\" \"The whole vibe was so loving and positive,\" says Jackie Frazier. \"Everyone needs to know that this place provides the absolute best care for kids living with special needs.\" So when the Fraziers were asked to team with the CSH Foundation to help raise $45 million in support of the Transforming Lives 2.0 capital campaign, they readily stepped up. \"We want everyone to know that each and every one of us can make a difference for kids living with special needs right here in New Jersey by supporting the expansion of Children's Specialized through this campaign,\" says Todd. MAJOR INVESTMENTS The Transforming Lives 2.0 campaign aims to do nothing less than design the next generation of care through major investments in both inpatient and outpatient resources. Improvements will include new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, and expansion to new locations. A particular focus is on care for patients with autism, including sophisticated new technologies for screening, assessment, intervention and caretaker training. The Transforming Lives 2.0 campaign is co-led by community leaders and members of the CSH Foundation Board of Trustees Mark Montenero, President of Autoland Toyota, Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, and Ram Trucks in Springfield, and Ed McKenna, Esq., Senior Partner at McKenna, Dupont, Stone and Washburne, and former mayor of Red Bank. \"This campaign will enable us to increase access to CSH's essential and innovative programs and services,\" says Matthew B.

Healthy Together | PB | Spring 2022 RWJBarnabas Health | PM3/4/22 3:35 PMYou're trying to quit smoking. You really want a cigarette. What do you do? Pills, medications and patches can help a person overcome a nicotine addiction. But equally important is to have support from the people in your life\u2014loved ones, colleagues, healthcare providers\u2014and from trained counselors who understand just how challenging the journey can be. The free Nicotine and Tobacco Recovery Program offered by the RWJBarnabas Health Institute for Prevention and Recovery (IFPR) employs a full range of tools to quit smoking, including counseling and support groups. Last summer, the program unveiled a new support option: a text-based service known as the Tobacco Recovery Concierge. The service offers real-time support via texting for moments when triggers or cravings are strong. \"In these cases, we can offer tips for a behavior change that they can make to help the craving subside, such as going for a walk, having a drink of water or doing breathing and relaxation exercises,\" explains Monica Hanna, MPH, CHES, NCTTP, Assistant Director of the Nicotine and Tobacco Recovery Program. \"Research has shown that cessation counseling and support can double a person's chances of success when quitting nicotine,\" she says. \"This new service allows us to tailor messages to patients for whatever they're going through at the moment.\" NOT JUST A HABIT Powered by GoMo Health, the Tobacco Recovery Concierge provides regular motivational and educational messages based on where a person is in his or her quit journey. These scheduled messages might include a link to a website where people share their stories, or to a calculator for figuring out exactly how much a person will save by quitting nicotine. For times when participants need immediate support, they can text one of a number of keywords such as \"craving,\" \"mood,\" \"relax\" or \"meet.\" Responses might include motivational messaging or a link to login information for IFPR Zoom meetings. A chat feature is also available through a HIPAA-secure portal. The program, which began in July 2021, has served more than 200 people so far and gets about 30 new signups each month, Hanna says. Quitting nicotine can be as hard as quitting heroin or cocaine, research shows. On average, people try to quit smoking five to seven times before they quit for good. \"Our goal is to break down the stigma of nicotine addiction. Even healthcare providers too often regard it as a bad habit,\" Hanna says. \"Instead, we approach it the same way we would treat a chronic disease such as diabetes or heart failure. We help patients deal with the physiological effects. And we know that when we combine that approach with counseling, a person's chances of success are much greater. No one should feel like they have to make this journey alone.\" A NEW SERVICE PROVIDES CUSTOMIZED SUPPORT. The Nicotine and Tobacco Recovery Program includes nicotine replacement therapies, recommendations on prescription smoking medication, and individual and group counseling. The program, funded by the New Jersey Department of Health Office of Tobacco Control, Nutrition and Fitness, is offered free of charge by the RWJBarnabas Health Institute for Prevention and Recovery in Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Somerset and Union counties.

TOBACCO RECOVERY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS Healthy Together | 16 | 3/4/22 3:39 PM3/4/22 3:39 PMBRIDGING A LANGUAGE BARRIER HOW A BILINGUAL PATIENT NAVIGATOR CAN HELP IMPROVE PATIENT HEALTH. What do you do as a patient navigator? I help Spanish-speaking patients with translation services at the bedside, consults with staff and assistance at the time of discharge. I inform and educate patients on resources available at RWJUH Somerset such as help with financial and insurance difficulties, materials on topics such as diabetes management or nutrition, and information on services such as breast cancer care or prevention. I also help patients make follow-up appointments and fill out paperwork. How do patients benefit from your services? A navigator gives patients an extra level of comfort and assurance while in the hospital. I am physically in the room with patients, help thoroughly explain whatever they're going through and continue to follow each case. When patients have access to a familiar support person and are able to call or text me at 848.230.5002 if they need help, the experience becomes a little less overwhelming. That can help patients achieve better health outcomes. Why is fluently speaking two languages important for a navigator? It's important to facilitate communication, not only in my program but also in our partnered Chinese and Indian programs. Knowing someone is designated to help bridge a language barrier helps both patients and staff feel more at ease. It's helpful for everyone. To contact the Hispanic Medical Program at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset, call 848.230.5002.Engaging the community and expanding access to underserved populations are ongoing priorities at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset.

Healthy Together | PB | Spring 2022 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset | RWJBH.ORG/SOMERSET THE MYCHART PATIENT PLATFORM GIVES ONE WOMAN ACCESS TO VITAL HEALTH INFORMATION But now she enjoys quick online access to her health information and providers through a patient portal that went live last October at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset. The portal is a patient engagement platform called MyChart that gives patients access to their medical records and allows them to communicate electronically with providers to better manage their care. MyChart is part of an electronic health records (EHR) system called Epic that is rolling out across the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system over two years. \"MyChart is very informative and efficient,\" says Nash, 65, a retired obstetrician-gynecologist in Bridgewater. \"Every time a test result comes in, I go to MyChart and can look at my results. I think it's great.\" COORDINATED CARE MyChart is particularly useful in tracking and coordinating care among RWJBH providers and non-system providers who also use the Epic system. It proved helpful when Nash received As a patient with heart disease who has had multiple doctor visits and several procedures over the last few years, Pamela Nash became accustomed to being on hold\u2014waiting on the phone to get test results, hear answers to questions, schedule checkups or refill prescriptions.TRACKING CARDIAC CARE Even on the go, Pamela Nash has easy, secure access to health information such as her record of cardiac care through RWJUH Somerset's MyChart patient platform. SHARAN MAHAL, MD Healthy Together | 18 | Spring 2022 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset | RWJBH.ORG/SOMERSET RWJUHS_CardiacPatient_Spr22_final_10.5.indd 18RWJUHS_CardiacPatient_Spr22_final_10.5.indd 18 3/3/22 in in November 2021 after experiencing chest pain. \"The coordination of care between RWJUH Somerset and the other hospital\u2014both of them on Epic\u2014was just fantastic,\" says cardiologist Sharan Mahal, MD, Director of Interventional Cardiology at RWJUH Somerset and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. \"We could do all her labs here, and they could see them there. When we performed a nuclear stress test, that report was available to them. When they did an angiogram on her, I could see the results right away.\" Sharing access to patient records helps doctors save time and improve care. \"We don't have to call other physicians to fax over lab results,\" Dr. Mahal explains. \"I can see them on the system. If they have notes, I can see those as well. MyChart prevents delay, helps provide more accurate diagnoses and reduces the need for repeat, unnecessary testing.\" ACTIVE PARTICIPATION In the past, much of this information was not available to patients. \"A lot of patients love MyChart because they can see their cholesterol, see their sugars or reread what a doctor recommended if they forgot,\" Dr. Mahal says. \"It makes patients more active participants in their care.\" Nash now routinely uses MyChart to refill prescriptions, pay medical bills, check in before office visits or procedures and fill out paperwork. Preregistering on MyChart for a recent nuclear stress test produced a bar code she could use to check in when she arrived at RWJUH Somerset. \"You don't have to sit in the registration area because you already did everything online,\" she says. Nash's November catheterization revealed no new blockages. She continues having periodic checkups with Dr. Mahal to monitor her medications, conduct tests such as EKGs and echocardiograms and ensure her condition remains stable. And she'll be using MyChart to keep track of her care every step of the way.TRACKING CARDIAC CARE For more information about the MyChart patient engagement platform at RWJBarnabas Health or to register for a free account, visit www.rwjbh.org/MyChart.EXCELLING IN PACEMAKER OUTCOMES Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset earned a 5-star rating for Pacemaker Procedure outcomes according to new research released by Healthgrades, which each year evaluates performance at nearly 4,500 hospitals nationwide for 31 common inpatient procedures and conditions. Healthgrades' analysis shows that patients treated at hospitals receiving a 5-star rating have a lower risk of experiencing complications and mortality during a hospital stay than patients treated at hospitals receiving a 1-star rating for that procedure or condition. RWJUH Somerset also leads with innovations. The hospital recently began using the minimally invasive Micra leaderless pacemaker, a device only about the size of a vitamin pill that is implanted directly into the heart and does not need wires. Insertion of the new pacemaker through a vein in the leg also requires no chest incision. \"Our cardiac catheterization laboratory performs a high volume of procedures each year, including cardiac pacemaker implants,\" says Tony Cava, President and Chief Executive Officer, RWJUH Somerset. \"That experience combined with the expertise of our cardiologists, nurses and technicians offers the best outcomes for our patients. Healthgrades' 5-star rating affirms our commitment to excellence and assures our community that state- of-the-art cardiac care is right here when they need it.\" RENOVATION ADDS TO FULL-SERVICE CARDIAC PROGRAM The recent renovation of a cardiac catheterization lab at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset allows procedures to be performed with shorter preparation and procedure times. The renovated space is one of three cardiac catheterization labs at the hospital where procedures including pacemaker implantation and emergency or elective coronary angioplasty are performed. The new lab features the Azurion with FlexArm image-guided therapy system from Philips Healthcare, which delivers high-quality imaging with low X-ray dose levels. In addition to a full range of diagnostic services, the hospital offers a three-phase cardiac rehabilitation program in Hillsborough. The hospital also recently renovated its 2-West and 2-East Cardiology Pavilions, which feature private rooms with \"smart beds\" and the latest wireless telemetry system. RWJUH Somerset is one of only two hospitals in New Jersey to receive the Joint Commission's Gold Seal of Approval for its acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) program, and has been recognized by U.S. News & World Report as \"high performing\" in the care of congestive heart failure.

Equipped with a referral from his primary care physician, Fricano promptly set up an appointment at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset's renowned Diabetes Center. The center provides one-on-one education, blood sugar monitoring, meal planning, nutritional counseling and other services to help people with diabetes successfully manage their condition through measures such as exercise, diet modification, weight loss and medication. \"I knew from the get-go that I had to change my behaviors and attitudes,\" Fricano says. \"I had to say to myself, 'I want this disease to lose and me to win.'\" A PERSONALIZED APPROACH Diabetes Center staff members such as nutritionists, diabetes educators and advanced practice nurses customize Diabetes is never a welcome diagnosis, but Bridgewater resident Frank Fricano found his to be especially disturbing. Fricano has witnessed several relatives struggle with serious complications from the chronic condition, including vision loss, foot amputation and even death. \"I know what diabetes does to the body,\" says Fricano, a 64-year-old hotel executive who received his diagnosis in June 2021. Diabetes impairs the body's ability to produce or respond to the hormone insulin, disrupting the body's 'I WANT THIS DISEASE TO LOSE' Frank Fricano consults certified diabetes educator Welda Joseph, APN (left), and registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator Rachna Singh, RD, CDE.

Visits spaced over several months typically begin with a comprehensive two-hour meeting to evaluate a patient's health status and goals, says Rachna Singh, RD, CDE, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator at the center. About 80 diabetes patients\u2014including pregnant women with gestational diabetes\u2014visit the center each month. \"We set individualized goals\u2014not everyone is going to run on a treadmill or walk every day\u2014but those goals are set by the patient,\" Singh says. \"We ask what they're willing to do to make their blood sugars go down and not need more medications. Weight is on most of their minds, but we tell them, 'If you adapt to a healthier lifestyle, the weight loss will follow.'\" Singh was impressed with Fricano's motivation, and the pair together designed a meal plan that \"allowed him to balance everything out during his day,\" Singh says. \"He was on bare minimum medication and wanted to keep it like that.\" In fact, reducing his reliance on drugs for diabetes and high blood pressure was one of Fricano's key goals. But he also wanted to continue enjoying occasional treats and beloved foods like pasta and bread. Singh guided him on ways to reduce portion sizes without cutting favorite foods and encouraged him to keep a food diary that logs his everyday eating patterns to help him make strategic choices. \"It was a great opportunity to learn what I needed to do to make these changes,\" Fricano says. \"Everything is fine in moderation, and I enjoy sweets once a week. But I know that if I want to pick up a bar of chocolate, I will have only one piece.\" IMPRESSIVE RESULTS Fricano now tests his blood sugar levels every morning and reads food labels or menus for information such as calorie counts and sugar content when grocery shopping or eating out. He even traveled to Disney World with his family in September 2021 without going overboard on less-than-healthy fare. \"I have not changed my enjoyment of food,\" he says. \"I still enjoy everything but have changed the way I look at foods now.\" Fricano's results speak for themselves: He lost 45 pounds and dropped his A1C level\u2014a measurement of blood sugar over time\u2014to within normal range in several months. He also has less knee pain and feels more energetic. Singh and other Diabetes Center staff have been so impressed by Fricano's transformation, they've asked him to be a motivational speaker for fellow patients. \"I'm on a long-term plan,\" Fricano says. \"I want to make sure I'm here for my wife, Rosalie, as well as my grandson and the rest of my family.\" To schedule an appointment at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset's Diabetes Center, call 908.685.2846.

U.S. News & World Report recently recognized RWJUH Somerset as one of the nation's \"High-Performing Hospitals\" in diabetes for 2021-2022. Featuring nutritionists and diabetes educators who help patients with insulin management, meal planning and blood sugar control, the 25-year-old program also has been awarded its fourth three-year Education Recognition Certificate from the American Diabetes Association for maintaining national standards for quality diabetes self-management education. \"We're one of the few hospitals that have an outpatient diabetes center,\" Singh says. \"It really benefits patients to have a center focusing only on diabetes where they can learn to test their blood sugars and manage their disease.\" \"I'M ON A LONG-TERM PLAN.
