Autoimmune diseases are disorders in which individual cells and organs in the body are targeted by the immune system, mistaking them for foreign cells. The immune system is the defense system of our body; it protects us from diseases and illnesses. This does by releasing a set of proteins known as antibodies that destroy harmful microbes that invade the body. These proteins can recognize and differentiate between our normal cells and those of harmful germs. In autoimmune disease, however, the antibodies error some normal body cells for foreign cells. This induces them to misfire and attack these cells in the procedure. These antibodies are known as autoantibodies in this scenario. Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Type 1 Diabetes mellitus are examples of autoimmune diseases. Any part of your body may be affected by autoimmune disease, and the symptoms that result depend on the organ that is attacked. The immune cells target only one organ, such as the joints, skin, or stomach, in some autoimmune diseases; all body areas are affected in various forms. The key question is, what is the cause of this immune system malfunction? Causes of Autoimmune Disease Autoimmune disease causes are mostly unknown. Scientists and physicians are still analyzing this phenomenon to have a better comprehension of it. However, there's a growing consensus that an interplay of environmental and genetic factors may contribute to the phenomenon. - Genetic Factors The genetic factors that lead to autoimmunity may explain why it runs in individual families. Although not every member of these households gets the exact autoimmune disorder, each inherits this trend for their immune system to misfire. More so, a finding that supports the use of genes in autoimmunity is the high risk of autoimmune disease in specific cultural groups. For example, systemic lupus erythematosus (or just known as lupus) affects more Hispanics and African-Americans than Caucasians. Additionally, for reasons not clearly understood yet, women are more prone to autoimmune disorders than men, typically starting during a woman's reproductive age. Some findings indicate that [female reproductive hormones](https://www.nourishdoc.com/webinars/ayurvedic-herbs-for-hormonal-imbalance-in-females) can play a role in autoimmunity\u2014estrogen, and progesterone. - Environmental Factors Scientists have started to uncover several substances from the environment that could trigger an autoimmune reaction in our bodies. Some of the factors include: Our immune can cause an autoimmune reaction by infectious agents, including some viruses and bacteria. Solvents observed in several industrial products such as paints, nail polish, and cleaning agents may increase your risk of systemic sclerosis. This autoimmune disorder affects the skin and connective tissues. Excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight has been linked with an autoimmune disease that affects muscles, myositis. Heavy metals like mercury, which may be passed to us when we consume contaminated fish, can also lead to autoimmune disease. Exposure to industrial substances, such as silica and asbestos, may foster autoimmune diseases involving the lungs. These compounds deposit in the lungs, setting off extensive inflammatory reactions. Smoke from cigarettes also raises the likelihood of rheumatoid arthritis. Food is also a significant culprit. Eating gluten, which is found in individual grains, can give rise to Celiac disease, an autoimmune disease involving the small intestine. The typical \"Western diet,\" comprising high-fat, high-sugar, and processed foods, is also regarded as a risk factor for dysfunctional immune reaction. - Examples of Autoimmune Diseases More than 80 kinds of autoimmune disorders, with varying symptoms that depend on the organ(s), are affected. Some of the diseases may be life-threatening, while some could be long-standing and debilitating. Autoimmune conditions are typically chronic and life-threatening. Treatment & prevention of autoimmune disorder No remedies for autoimmune disorders have been identified. However, because the autoimmune hyperactive immune system brings on autoimmune diseases in our bodies, one way to deal with it is to reduce immune activity. This means physicians may prescribe a particular class of drugs called immunosuppressants to control your symptoms. Your physician may also prescribe other medications depending on the sort of autoimmune disease. As an example, pain relief drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and insulin for type 1 diabetes. - Prevention Autoimmune diseases are linked to excessive inflammation. Therefore, one way you can decrease your risk of autoimmune disease is by avoiding factors that cause excessive inflammation. How can you do that? With a proper diet and foods that can help. Get on a whole-food, plant-based diet since this is full of vitamins and antioxidants that help to mop up toxins, which may incite an immune reaction. This diet includes a lot of vegetables (leafy greens, squash, onions, carrots, turnips), spices (ginger, cayenne pepper, garlic, turmeric), and fruits (apples, mangoes, berries, etc.). Avoid foods that cause inflammation, such as red meat, high-fat dairy products, refined sugars, refined grains, and oils that are refined. The immune system in Ayurveda According to Ayurveda, Vyadhikashamatwa is the energy of human anatomy that overpowers the disease's harmful effects and stops its initiation. The modern idea of immunity can be contrasted with the concept of Vaydhikshamatwa in Ayurveda. It is made up of 2 words Vyadi and kshamatwa. Vyadhi means disorder, to harm, to injure or harm, and kshamatwa signifies ability or immunity. Therefore the term Vaydhikshamatwa implies the capability to withstand the disease. In charka Samhita, chakrapani clarifies vyadhikshamatwa as vyadhibalavirodhitvam means the body's ability to fight against the manifested disease Vyadhyutapadaparatibandakatva means the power of the body to avoid the practice of disease manifestation. The body's capacity to withstand the incidence of any illness or the capability to resist the development of this manifested disease is called vuyadhikshamatva, or immunity in Ayurveda. The expression Bala is also regarded as a synonym of resistance. Bala means the strength of body immunity. It's classified into three types, namely. Sahaja Bala (Innate Immunity) - The physical and psychological strength gift naturally by Birth. Kalaja Bala (Acquired Immunity)- Power because of the complimentary period, age, etc... Yuktikruta Bala (Artificial Immunity) -is your strength attained by following an appropriate diet and lifestyle ...
