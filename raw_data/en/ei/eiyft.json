Seroepidemiological data is an important tool to evaluate the NIP, hence a cross-sectional representative population-based serosurveillance study was conducted for the first time in CN in mid-2017. Participants (n = 1829, aged 0-90 years) donated a blood sample and completed a health-related questionnaire. MMR-specific IgG antibodies were determined using a bead-based multiplex immunoassay and risk factors were analyzed using logistic regression models. Overall seroprevalence was high for measles (94%), but lower for mumps and rubella (both 85%). In NIP eligibles, including women of childbearing age, rubella seroprevalence (88%) exceeded the threshold for protection (85%); however, for measles (89%) this protective level (95%) was not met. MMR seropositivity was lowest in children who became CN resident at 11-17 years of age (especially for measles (72%)), mostly originating from Latin America and other non-Western countries. Interestingly, rubella seroprevalence was lowest in non-NIP eligible adults from Dutch overseas territories and Suriname (75%). Taken together, MMR immunity is generally good in CN, nonetheless some risk groups were identified. Additionally, we found evidence for a unique island epidemiology. In light of recent regional measles outbreaks, disease monitoring remains of utmost importance.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-10-01", "cleaned_text": "incidence of MMR has declined drastically since the introduction of routine vaccination in the 1980s, elimination remains challenging, particularly for measles [ [2](#B2-vaccines-07-00137)]. In fact, recent global resurgence of measles, involving large outbreaks in the World Health Organization (WHO) Region of the Americas, is of great concern as vaccination coverage is frequently insufficient to achieve herd protection in most countries [ [3](#B3-vaccines-07-00137), [4](#B4-vaccines-07-00137)]. [Figure S1](#app1-vaccines-07-00137)gives an overview of introduction of MMR vaccinations and adaptations since 1975. Currently, the National Immunization Program (NIP) recommends two doses against MMR: On Bonaire, the first dose (MMR-1) is administered at 14 months and MMR-2 at 18 months (MMR-2 before 2019 at nine years of age); on St. Eustatius and Saba, MMR-1 is given at 12 months and MMR-2 at four years of age (MMR-2 before 2007 and 2016, respectively, at nine years of age) [ [5](#B5-vaccines-07-00137)]. Vaccination coverage in CN has been registered routinely since a few years: In 2017, MMR-1-coverage was [8](#B8-vaccines-07-00137)]. The recent large measles outbreak across the Americas emphasizes the urgent need for information on protection against vaccine-preventable diseases, which is lacking for CN [ [3](#B3-vaccines-07-00137)]. The aim of this cross-sectional population-based seroepidemiological study was to investigate the humoral immunity against MMR in the general population of CN, which enables identification of possible gaps in immunity (seronegativity) and risk factors associated with these gaps. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Study Population [9](#B9-vaccines-07-00137)]. Briefly, on each island an age-stratified sample, with age strata 0-11, 12-17, 18-34, 35-59 and 60-89 years, was randomly drawn from the population registry of the Dutch overseas territories (PIVA-V, January 1, 2017). In total, 7768 eligible individuals were invited (Bonaire n = 4667; St. Eustatius n = 2062 and Saba n = 1039; see [Figure S2](#app1-vaccines-07-00137)for a flowchart of the study). Prior to participation, signed informed consent was obtained (from: <12 years of age: Parent/legal guardian; 12-17 years of Participant and parent/legal guardian and 18 years of age: Participant). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee Noord-Holland (METC-number: M015-022). At the clinic, participants were requested to donate a blood sample\u2014via a finger or heel prick using the dried blood spot method (DBS) on air-dried filter paper (Whatman\u00ae 903 protein saver cards)\u2014to complete a questionnaire, and to bring their vaccination certificate. If the latter was not available, vaccination status was retrieved from the local public health department if obtainable. 2.2. Laboratory Analyses [10](#B10-vaccines-07-00137)]. In short, following standard protocol, a 3.2 mm (1/8 inch) punch was taken from the DBS and incubated in 300 assay buffer) at 4 \u00b0C overnight on a shaker to release serum (resulting in a 1:200 dilution) [ [11](#B11-vaccines-07-00137), [12](#B12-vaccines-07-00137)]. Sera were further diluted to 1:4000 in assay buffer. Controls, blanks and the international standard for rubella (RUBI-1-94), which was calibrated against the international standard for measles and an in-house standard for mumps, were included on each plate. Antibody concentrations were obtained by interpolation of the mean fluorescent intensity in the reference serum curve using a logistic-5PL regression type and expressed in international units per mL (IU/mL) for measles and rubella and RIVM units per mL (RU/mL) for mumps\u2014as no international standard is available. An antibody concentration of 0.120 IU/mL for measles [ [13](#B13-vaccines-07-00137)] and 10.0 IU/mL for [ [14](#B14-vaccines-07-00137)] was considered protective and used as cut-off for seropositivity. For mumps, no correlate of protection is available: An antibody concentration of 45.0 RU/mL was used as arbitrary criterion for seroprevalence, upon agreement by the European Sero-Epidemiology Network [ [15](#B15-vaccines-07-00137)]. 2.3. Data Analyses 2.3.1. Seroprevalence and GMC [16](#B16-vaccines-07-00137)]. Risk ratios, their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p values were estimated by Monte Carlo simulations of these seroprevalence estimates. Dissimilarities in GMC between islands and gender were identified by calculating the difference in natural logarithmic (ln) concentrations and tested using a t-test. Age-specific seroprevalence, GMC and 95% CI were calculated for CN and per island. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. 2.3.2. Waning Immunity after MMR Vaccination [17](#B17-vaccines-07-00137)]) and MMR-2 between 8-10 years of age, both given at least 2 months before inclusion in the study. Additionally, maximum age at study inclusion was 9 and 30 years for one and two dose(s), respectively. For mumps, those with self-reported mumps symptoms in the preceding year were excluded. 2.3.3. Risk Factors for Seronegativity [Figure S2](#app1-vaccines-07-00137)). Allowing the measles model to converge, those born before introduction of routine vaccination were exclude (ntotal = 1075), i.e., a period characterized by widespread measles circulation causing nearly all participants to be seropositive (on Bonaire from 42 years of age, and on St. Eustatius and Saba from 36 years). Information on the history of MMR vaccinations on Bonaire before 1988 was derived from neighboring Dutch Leeward Antilles island Cura\u00e7ao as the same NIP was applied. Studied risk factors included sociodemographics, vaccination history and other health-related factors. Aside from age and sex, variables with p < 0.10 in univariate analyses were included in the multivariate analyses. Backward selection was used to identify independent determinants in which p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant associated. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were estimated as well as unadjusted seroprevalence and 95% CIs for all studied factors. 3. Results 3.1. Study Characteristics [Figure S2](#app1-vaccines-07-00137); 824 (45%) men and 1005 (55%) women; aged 3 months to 90 years), with equal distribution over the islands according to population size (Bonaire: 1129 1](#vaccines-07-00137-t001)). Most participants originated from the Dutch overseas territories (comprising CN, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and St. Maarten) and Suriname (DOT-Sur; n = 1312, 72%), followed by Latin America and other non-Western countries (LA-nonW; n = 281, 16%), and indigenous Dutch and other Western countries (iD-Wes; n = 223, 12%). Almost half of the participants reported to be low educated (n = 883), compared to 26% middle and 18% high (8% unknown). On Saba, relatively more iD-Wes, LA-nonW and those with a high educational level participated\u2014consistent with its population composition [ [18](#B18-vaccines-07-00137), [19](#B19-vaccines-07-00137)]\u2014as compared to Bonaire and St. Eustatius. Among NIP eligible participants, i.e., those born in the MMR vaccination era, registered vaccination coverage with at least one dose against MMR ranged between 69-76% among the islands, and 8-9% were unvaccinated (and the remainder self-reported to have (partly) participated in the NIP). 3.2. Age-Specific Seroprevalence and GMC [Table 2](#vaccines-07-00137-t002)shows the overall weighted IgG seroprevalence and GMC of MMR in the total CN population, stratified by island and sex, and among NIP eligibles and non-NIP eligible adults. In total, 72.0% (n = 1337) were seropositive for all three pathogens, and 2.5% seronegative (n = 47; of which n = 26 had not reached the NIP eligible age, including all infants between 3-5 months of age (n = 6) for whom protective maternal antibody concentrations could be expected). There was no difference in overall seroprevalence for MMR between islands (all p > 0.05). Weighted MMR seroprevalence and GMC, stratified by age groups, for CN are depicted in [Figure 1](#vaccines-07-00137-f001)A-C, and per island in [Figure S3A-C](#app1-vaccines-07-00137). The possible effect of storage and transportation on antibody concentrations of DBS samples in this study was investigated: No significant difference (all p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA) was found between MMR antibody concentrations of samples obtained at the start of the study (having the longest storage period (4 weeks)) compared to samples stored shorter (1, 2 and 3 weeks)\u2014while displaying a similar age distribution. 3.2.1. Measles [Table 2](#vaccines-07-00137-t002)). Seroprevalence in CN did not differ significantly between men and women (93.1% vs. 94.5%, respectively, p = 0.31); however overall GMC was lower for men (0.87 vs. women: 1.00 IU/mL, p = 0.03). On St. Eustatius a sex difference was observed in both the total population (seroprevalence men: 91.0% vs. women: 97.0%, p 0.75 vs. women: 1.27 IU/mL, 1](#vaccines-07-00137-f001)A). Seroprevalence fluctuated between 85-100% for children up to 18 years of age, with the lowest seropositivity among residents from LA-nonW (e.g., 65.5% in age group 12-17 years; [Figure 2](#vaccines-07-00137-f002)A). GMC declined to 0.37 IU/mL at seven years of age, from where it remained range bound between 0.30-0.56 IU/mL until 35 years ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-07-00137-f001)A). 18-35 years, seroprevalence ranged between 80-95%. Seroprevalence and GMC were lower for NIP-eligible participants (89.2% and 0.46 IU/mL, respectively) as 1.96 IU/mL, respectively; [Table 2](#vaccines-07-00137-t002)). From 35 years of age, GMC rapidly inclined to 2.5 IU/mL at 60 years, and seroprevalence remained 100% (104 RU/mL) as compared to Bonaire and Saba (both p < 0.005). Among sexes, overall seroprevalence and GMC were similar (p > 0.05; [Table 85.8 vs. women: 127 RU/mL, p < 0.0001) were higher in women (data not shown). Symptoms of mumps in the preceding year (ntotal = 27) were most frequently self-reported by 13-34 year-olds (n = 16), and their GMC was higher than those 13-34 years without symptoms (202 vs. 116 RU/mL, respectively, p = 0.02). [Figure 1](#vaccines-07-00137-f001)B and [Figure S3B](#app1-vaccines-07-00137)). At 10 years of MMR-2 on Bonaire), seroprevalence in CN was 89.2% and and GMC fluctuated between 80-94% and 106-169 RU/ml, respectively, with age group 18-20 years displaying the highest prevalence (94.4%). All islands showed a similar trend in seroprevalence with age, except for age group 18-34 years in which seroprevalence was considerably higher on Bonaire (90.2%) than the other islands (<70%; [Figure S3B](#app1-vaccines-07-00137)). Overall seroprevalence in non-NIP eligible adults was lowest in residents from DOT-Sur (82.2%, and, e.g., in age group 60-90 on the other islands (24.8; Bonaire: 32.0 and Saba: 36.6 IU/mL (St. Eustatius p = 0.02 and St. Eustatius vs. Saba: p = 0.004)). Between sexes, no difference in overall seroprevalence was observed in CN (men: 86.0% vs. women 83.0%, p = 0.17) and on each island ( [Table 2](#vaccines-07-00137-t002)); yet, on St. Eustatius, GMC was higher in women (29.9 vs. men: 20.6 IU/mL, p = 0.01; data not shown). Notably, on Bonaire, seroprevalence in non-NIP eligible men (86.6%) was higher than in women (73.9%, p = 0.005; data not shown), also reflected by a higher overall GMC in men (36.0 vs. and fluctuated between 87-100% until 18 years of age. Participants from LA-nonW aged 12-17 years were least seropositive (79.5%; [Figure 2](#vaccines-07-00137-f002)C). GMC reached its highest peak at four years of age at 76.0 IU/mL and declined to 33.3 IU/mL at seven years ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-07-00137-f001)C). From there it steadily declined towards 40 years of age (ranging between 25-39 IU/mL), reaching its lowest concentration at age group 40-44 years (19.8 IU/mL), but still above the cut-off for protection. Seroprevalence varied between 83-91% in adults aged 18-40 years. Unlike measles, seroprevalence remained indifferent after 40 years of age, varying between 76-87% and GMC between 25-47 IU/mL. Interestingly, seroprevalence and GMC in non-NIP eligible adults from DOT-Sur and LA-nonW were substantially lower than in iD-Wes (e.g., overall seroprevalence was 75.4%, 81.8% and 97.0%, respectively), and this also applied to the different age groups among them ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-07-00137-f002)C)). 3.3. Waning Immunity after MMR Vaccination [Figure S4A-D](#app1-vaccines-07-00137)). For mumps, no decline in antibody concentration was observed after MMR-1 (n = 125; slope: 0.03 ln-RU/mL per year, 0.55,) slope: -0.02, participants aged 0-1 and 2-10 years (vs. 11-17), those who have been resident of CN since age group 11-17 years (vs. 0-1), individuals who were vaccinated once, those self-reported to have (partly) followed the NIP, those who were unvaccinated and who were not eligible for the NIP (vs. two or more doses) were found to be significant risk factors for seronegativity in multivariate analysis ( [Table 4](#vaccines-07-00137-t004)). The multivariate model for rubella revealed that all age groups except 11-17 years (vs. 2-10), those who have been resident of CN since age 0-17 years (vs. 40-59), people who self-reported to have (partly) followed the NIP, those unvaccinated and who were not eligible for the NIP (vs. two or more doses) were significantly associated with seronegativity ( [Table 5](#vaccines-07-00137-t005)). 4. Discussion [20](#B20-vaccines-07-00137), in children who became CN resident at 11-17 years of age (especially for measles (72%)), mostly originating from Latin America and other non-Western countries. MMR vaccinations elicited good antibody responses and receiving two doses of MMR (vs. one) indicated prolonged humoral immunity. Interestingly, rubella seroprevalence was lowest in non-NIP eligible adults from DOT-Sur (75%), illustrative of a specific island epidemiology in the pre-vaccination era. [22](#B22-vaccines-07-00137)]. As reviewed by Dimech and colleagues [ [23](#B23-vaccines-07-00137)], other large population studies reported seroprevalence rates between 54-96% (e.g., Italy: 74%, USA: 93%), which the Netherlands highest (96%). Seroprevalence for mumps in CN (85%) was rather similar to the USA (88%) [ [24](#B24-vaccines-07-00137)], but somewhat lower than the Netherlands (91%) [ [25](#B25-vaccines-07-00137)]. Rubella seroprevalence in CN (85%) was mostly lower than studies performed elsewhere, e.g., Colombia (89%), the Netherlands (95%) and Thailand (98%) [ [23](#B23-vaccines-07-00137)]. Main drivers coinciding with differences in seroprevalence and antibody responses between and within populations can be attributed to vaccination status (and vaccine effectivity in general) as well as (past) natural exposure to these pathogens. [4](#B4-vaccines-07-00137)], vaccination policy with respect to eligible immigrants aged <18 years was tightened where possible. [26](#B26-vaccines-07-00137), [27](#B27-vaccines-07-00137)]. Nonetheless, as cellular immunity is assumed to be an essential part of protection [ [28](#B28-vaccines-07-00137)], higher risk of susceptibility among vaccinated men remains questionable. Future research in outbreak settings might provide clarification on this potential sex difference in vaccinated cases. [25](#B25-vaccines-07-00137), [29](#B29-vaccines-07-00137), [30](#B30-vaccines-07-00137)]. This concept is best underlined by measles, a highly infectious agent that is capable of disseminating throughout susceptible populations [ [31](#B31-vaccines-07-00137)]. Hence, nearly all non-NIP eligible adults in our study were seropositive for measles displaying high antibody concentrations, i.e., were infected, possible boosted regularly and thus protected. However, this was different for the less infectious pathogens mumps and, in particular, rubella. Interestingly, adult participants who were born on the islands or resided there since childhood were more likely to be seronegative. This was confirmed by a lower seroprevalence and GMC in adults from DOT-Sur and LA-nonW descent when compared to iD-Wes who were born in rubella endemic countries (mostly the Netherlands) prior to introduction of MMR vaccination. Principally for rubella, differences in seroprevalence between countries in the pre-vaccination period have been described [ [32](#B32-vaccines-07-00137)]. Hence, as CN was even more remote and isolated during the pre-globalization/vaccine era, we hypothesize that introduction and transmission of rubella occurred less often due to its lesser infectious character, causing less circulating and exposure, affecting less people. Whilst a proportion of these inhabitants might still be susceptible currently and future cases cannot be ruled-out completely, disease in elderly is expected to be mostly mild, and yet sufficient herd immunity should prevent transmission. Fortunately, seroprotection for rubella was above the threshold for protection in NIP eligibles, including women of childbearing age who are at risk of developing congenital rubella syndrome\u2014resulting in serious birth defects or miscarriage\u2014via rubella during pregnancy [ [20](#B20-vaccines-07-00137)]. This indicates long lasting immunological humoral memory\u2014when extended with similar rate of waning. Although this underlines the purpose of booster vaccination\u2014besides preventing primary vaccine failure\u2014we could not draw firm conclusions on the persistence of these antibodies as these data were cross-sectional. Similarly, the non-prospective character of our data was most likely the reason why mumps antibody levels were indifferent eight years after the first dose. Furthermore, seroprevalence rates for mumps should be interpreted with caution as a defined correlate of protection\u2014albeit recent research endeavored [ [34](#B34-vaccines-07-00137)]\u2014is still lacking. While two doses of MMR (vs. one) indicated a lower risk of mumps seronegativity in our study, outbreaks among twice vaccinated students\u2014with intensive and homogenous contact\u2014have been reported [ [35](#B35-vaccines-07-00137)]. In fact, in contrast to St. Eustatius and Saba, we observed a high seroprevalence and GMC in young adults on Bonaire and self-reporting of mumps symptoms was highest among this group too. This, together with confirmed cases from nearby Dutch Leeward Antilles island Aruba and recurrent traffic between these islands, could suggest possible exposure to mumps on Bonaire, whereas this likelihood might be lower on St. Eustatius and Saba, which are more isolated. [36](#B36-vaccines-07-00137)]. Timely vaccination and close monitoring remains of great importance, especially in light of recent regional circulation of the measles virus and migration of large populations at risk (e.g., from Venezuela) [ [3](#B3-vaccines-07-00137), [4](#B4-vaccines-07-00137)]. While considering an optimal age for vaccination, health authorities should take into account several factors, including immunological response, vaccine coverage, herd immunity thresholds and risk of infection [ [37](#B37-vaccines-07-00137)]. Although no cases of measles have been detected via the surveillance systems in CN recently, the public health department on Bonaire decided to lower the age of MMR-2 from 9 years to 18 months of age (as of January 1, 2019), in order to timely and adequately protect young infants and reduce the risk of viral introduction and transmission. [9](#B9-vaccines-07-00137)]). However, we partly corrected for this by weighting our sample on important sociodemographic characteristics. Further, to overcome logistical hurdles, we used DBS to collect our blood samples. Whilst this is a widely used and validated method for measuring antibodies, we could not exclude that storage and transportation might have had some effect on the antibody levels. We have investigated this and found little overall effect that has not affected our results. 5. Conclusions [20](#B20-vaccines-07-00137)]. Lastly, it is highly recommended to conduct serosurveillance studies in CN on a regular basis in the future in order to monitor the protection against vaccine-preventable diseases and timely detect (additional) gaps in population immunity [ [8](#B8-vaccines-07-00137)].
