[Vol. 14:2 presence of fluoride in drinking water, which is a distinct question. The focus of this article will be the artificial fluoridation of public water supplies which occurs when the fluoride content of drinking water is artificially adjusted fr om its natural level to a desired level of 0.9-l.2 ppm. This change is effected by adding sodium silico fluoride, hydrofluosilicic acid, or some such industrial waste product, which releases free fluoride ions into water consumed by human beings. 1 The th eory behind this practice, which now affects about 130 million people in the United States, is that the ingestion of fluoride will harden the surfaces of teeth and make them less susceptible to dental caries. The literature is extensive on whether this pr actice does or does not reduce tooth decay, and whether it is or is not safe. 2 The standard work, done under auspices of the American Dental Association (ADA) and the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) is the Newburgh -Kingston Caries -Fluorine Stu dy: Final Report .3 Published over forty years ago, it proudly concluded that artificial fluoridation of public water supplies dramatically reduces tooth de - cay in humans, at no risk to human health. 4 In language tinged with contemporary fanaticism, the Final Report announced, \"The opposi - tion stems from several sources, chiefly food faddists, cultists, chiropractors, misguided and misinformed persons who are ignorant of the scientific facts on the ingestion of water fluorides, and, strange as it may seem, even among a few uninformed physicians and dentists.\" 5 From the beginning, this ostentatious pronouncement has set the tone of ADA and USPHS activists and others promoting this practice ________________________________ ________________________ 1.

ET AL ., FLUORIDATION : THE GREAT DILEMMA 47-54, 148 - 74 (1978) f or a detailed discussion of the absorption of fluoride, mainly as free ions, into the soft tissues of the human body. On the other hand, when fluoride is naturally present in public water supplies, it is generally bound with calcium and other minerals and, in such form, it does not readily dissociate and so is more readily excreted. Experiments with trout indicate that fluoride in water so bound tends to be less toxic. See Joseph W. Angelovic et al., Temperature and Fluorosis in Rainbow Trout , 33 J. W ATER POLLUTION CONTROL FED'N 371 (1961). Hence, the artificial presence of fluoride in drinking water should be considered separately from its natural presence, at least in connection wi th questions about whether or not fluoride in drinking water produces harmful side effects. 2. The most respected scientific works, published during the twentieth century in support of artificial fluoridation of public water supplies, are WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION , FLUORIDES AND HUMAN HEALTH (1970), and FRANK J. M CCLURE , U.S. D EP'T OF HEALTH , EDUCATION , AND WELFARE , WATER FLUORIDATION : THE SEARCH AND THE VICTORY (1970).

Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 197 in the face of growing opposition from eminent scientists and physici ans. The ultimate merits of the issues in science and medicine aside, there has always been learned and respectable opposition to artificial fluoridation of public water supplies, 6 and all attempts to deny it can only be characterised as irresponsible. A few preliminary questions need to be asked. The first is whether the natural or artificial level of fluoride in public water supplies really has any beneficial effect in reducing tooth decay. The main difficulty with the experimental runs at Newburgh and Kingston in New York and elsewhere is that tooth decay is enhanced or diminished by innumerable factors including dietary, socio - economic, environmental, hygienic, and many others. Thus, criti - cism was voiced, initially in a doctoral dissertation, 7 that t here was no control for known and unknown variables and, consequently, the conclusions on the reduction of tooth decay associated with fluorida - tion were invalid. Subsequent research, involving vastly more data and sophistica - tion, has entirely upset the N ewburgh -Kingston orthodoxy. 8 It has since been persuasively demonstrated that the lowest rates of tooth decay in children occur in areas where the fluoride level is about 0.2 - 0.4 ppm, which is the normal level in most parts of the world. 9 From all publis hed studies on the question in Europe and North America, it has been shown that, while there is a strong positive relationship between dental mottling and the natural level of fluoride in drinking ________________________________ ________________________ 6. See, e.g., Hearings on H.R. 2341 Before the House Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce , 83d Cong. 62 -86 (1954) (statement of Frederick Exner, M.D.). In his time, George Waldbott, M.D., was the dean of physicians against fluoridation. His pionee ring book, A S TRUGGLE WITH TITANS (1965), is bound to be of great interest to scientific historians in future years. He was a founder of the International Society for Fluoride Research, a learned society of about five hundred scientists who specialize in the field, publishing a quarterly journal entitled Fluoride . 7.

Groth III, Two Issues of Science and Public Policy: Air Pollution Control in the San Francisco Bay Area and Fluoridation of Community Water Supplies 146 -462 (1973) (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Stanford University) (on file with University Microfilms in Ann Arbor, Michigan). 8.

Trends now evident in Newburgh and Kingston indicate no s ignificant differences in tooth decay rates between the two cities, although dental mottling is somewhat higher in fluoridated Newburgh.

[Vol. 14:2 water, there is no statistical relationship between the ext ent of tooth decay and the natural level of fluoride in drinking water. 10 In more recent years, it has been observed that tooth decay rates have de - creased as fast in unfluoridated areas as in fluoridated areas. 11 From massive data gathered by the governme nt of the United States, it has been revealed that there is no statistical relationship between rates of tooth decay in children and the extent or duration of artificial fluori - dation of public water supplies. 12 Another question is whether public officials of the United States have been honest in levelling with the American people about the potential harmful effects of artificially releasing fluoride into the environment. In this regard, some attention needs to be given to the seminal work of Dr. Alfred Tay lor, a biochemist at the University of Texas. The facts have been written up by reputable scholars 13 and make up an important episode in scientific history. In the early 1950s, Dr. Taylor undertook a series of preliminary experiments by which it appeared that cancer -prone mice consuming water treated with sodium fluoride had shorter life spans than mice drinking distilled water. 14 Because the mice in both the control and experimental groups ate chow containing measurable fluoride, probably as CaF, as he le arned after his initial runs, Dr. Taylor replicated his earlier work, but used chow containing negligible fluoride. He ran twelve experiments using 645 cancer -prone mice. He found that, as measured for statistical significance, cancer -prone mice drinking water containing fluoride, introduced as NaF, had shorter life spans than mice drinking distilled water. 15 In 1954, the results of Dr. Taylor's reruns were published in a refereed journal. 16 Dr. Taylor's work was published at a politically sensitive time, because the last stages of the much -boasted surveys at Newburgh and Kingston were underway. The obvious meaning of Dr. Taylor's results was that a possible danger to public health had been overlooked, and that widespread fluoridation should be delayed ________________________________ ________________________ Caries ], 122 GWF W ASSER /ABWASSER 495 (1981), translated in 14 FLUORIDE 123 (1981). 11.

Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 199 until the situation had been clarified. However, the ADA and the USPHS had already endorsed and begun the drive to promote fluoridation. The embarrassment, therefore, had to be addressed. In the Final Report , reference was made to Dr. Taylor's original test s two years after the positive results of his reruns had been peer -reviewed and published. Then it was said, contrary to the known state of world literature: The reports by Alfred Taylor, a biochemist at the University of Texas, on the increased incidence of cancer in mice drinking fluoride -treated water have been shown to be unfounded, since the food that he was giving the mice had many times the fluoride content of the drinking water, and the food was supplied both to the control and experimental groups. Subsequent tests did not confirm the differences.17 Ever since, USPHS officials have insisted, contrary to known facts, that Dr. Taylor's reruns were never done and never published, and that no work supporting Taylor's results exists or has ever been publ ished. For example, in a standard history of the National Insti - tute of Dental Health, published thirty -five years after Dr. Taylor's work first appeared in a refereed journal, Ruth Roy Harris said, \"Alfred Taylor, an investigator with a doctorate in bioc hemistry, indicated that he would not publish his findings because he was unable to confirm those results in a second experiment.\" 18 Harris added still another misrepresentation, also contrary to known facts, \"A literature search of scientific journals fai led to show any publica - tion of this work by Taylor -- an indication that it was not subjected to review by his peers.\" 19 The importance of Dr. Taylor's work is revealed by what USPHS officials have done to conceal it. After his first study, Dr. Taylor and his wife, also a Ph.D. bio - chemist, published the results of yet another large -scale study, in which fluoride in water, introduced as NaF, was shown to induce growth in implanted tumors in mice. 20 Dr. Taylor's pioneering work has been confirmed and reconf irmed by a considerable multitude of laboratory studies done by world class scientists, all published in ________________________________ ________________________ 17.

The question depends in part on scientific and medical facts. As we shall relate in detail, trial judges over the past twenty years have repeatedly found, after hearing experts, that fluoridation is injurious to public health. We proceed, first, to review the legal fundamentals. II. T HE NATURE OF POLICE POWER The first clause of Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution states that Congress shall have the power to \" provide for the common Defence and general Welfare.\" James Madison showed that this provision was intended to define the objects of federal spending, not to confer a general legislative authority upon Congress, because, if this clause conferred such a gen eral legislative ________________________________ ________________________ 21.

It would be a power, subject to the limitations inherent and implied in every republican form of government, 24 to enact only laws necessary and proper or, in other words, laws fairly proportioned to and consistent with the common defense and general welfare, in keeping with legal principle and legal tradition. 25 Alexander Hamilton made unmistakably clear that a bill of rights, including all essential privileges and immunities of a free people, is always implied, if not expressed, in every republican form of govern - ment. 26 And every republican form of government, as an outgrowth of the American Revolution, necessarily presupposes the essential truths of the Declaration of Independ ence, which begins, before all else, with a tribute to the \"Laws of Nature and Nature's God.\" 27 So it was that Justice Samuel Chase of the United States Supreme Court, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, thus expounded in a celebrated cas e the inherent limitations on general legislative authority under any republican form of government: ________________________________ ________________________ 23. See THE FEDERALIST NO. 41, at 276 -77 (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). In reaching this conclusion, Madison applied the r ule of construction from the common law that clauses dealing with the same general subject or question should be construed together, if possible, to give every distinct provision some useful purpose and to coalesce into a harmonious whole with the others. See THE FEDERALIST NO. 40, at 260 (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). The same idea is advanced in the 7th of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, authored by Thomas Jefferson. See 4 DEBATES ON THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION 542 (Elliot ed., Lippencott & Co., Philadel phia) (2d ed. 1859). 24. James Madison emphasized that the government of the Union, like the government of every State, is a republican form of government which has its origin in the people and features distinctive of the American Revolution. See THE FEDE RALIST NO. 39, at 240 -42 (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). The first mature prototype of such a republican form of government, see the Virginia Bill of Rights and Constitution of 1776, reprinted in 9 Hening's Statutes at Large, at 109-19. 25. See THE FEDERALI ST NO. 33, at 203 -04 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961); THE FEDERALIST NO. 44, at 285 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). Both Hamilton and Madison agreed that the eighteenth clause of Article I, Section 8, of the United States C onstitution, granting Congress the power to enact necessary and proper laws, would have been implied if it had not been expressed. Also, while it allows implied powers, it also imposes implied limits on powers of just legislation. The standard judicial d efinition of necessary and proper laws is found in M'Colloch v. Maryland , 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 3l6, 421 (1819). 26. See THE FEDERALIST NO. 84, at 512 -14 (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). 27. THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE para. 1 (U.S. 1776). Sir William Black stone gave incomparable exposition to t he meaning of natural law as the foundation of constitutional government in 1 C OMMENTARIES ON THE LAWS OF ENGLAND 38-43 (l765) [hereinafter BLACKSTONE ]. 202 J. LAND USE & ENVTL. L. [Vol. 14:2 The nature and ends of legislative power will limit the exercise of it. This fundamental principle flows from the very nature of our free Republican gover nments, that no man should be compelled to do what the laws do not require; nor to refrain from acts which the laws permit. There are acts which the Federal, or State, Legislatures cannot do, without exceeding their authority. There are certain vital pri nciples in our free Republican governments, which will determine and over -rule an apparent and flagrant abuse of legislative power; as to authorize manifest injustice by positive law; or to take away that security for personal liberty, or private property, for the protection whereof the government was established.28 There can be no serious dispute as to the nature of the original idea. In view of the transformations accomplished by the American Revolution, general legislative authority was understood to be the power of enacting necessary and proper laws to provide for the common defense and general welfare, in conformity with natural law and legal tradition. And this idea, fully justiciable, was imposed before the Fourteenth Amendment was ever thought of, b y the so - called Guarantee Clause in of the United States Constitution, which demands that in and for every State of the Union there shall be a \"Republican Form of Government.\" 29 The term \"police power\" later appeared as a term of juris - prudence in antebellu m litigation which arose under the Guarantee Clause, used to describe the legislative powers of the several States to enact regulations of domestic life. 30 The Guarantee Clause largely disappeared as a restraint upon the several States as a consequence of misunderstanding the interesting old case of Luther v. Borden .31 Many generations of judges and lawyers have been deeply confused about it. In 1842, there was a civil war between two state governments in Rhode Island, each claiming to be lawful. 32 Both the majority and the dissent agreed that the court could not resolve this question 33, which was said to be nonjusticiable, because of the enormous practical difficulties involved. Thus began the doctrine of political questions which says that a question is no njusticiable and so cannot be judicially decided if, in the circumstances, a practical remedy ________________________________ ________________________ 28.

Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 203 cannot be given by the courts, or if there are no objective legal standards upon which a judicial decision can be made, or if the question is plainly referred by fundamental law to the political organs of government or society. 34 Nothing could ever be so likely to injure the dignity or reputation of the bench than failure of judges to honor these inherent limits to their power. But there was another important quest ion in the case which most students have overlooked. This question was whether the charter government of Rhode Island, assumed legitimate, could impose martial law during the unrest which appears in retrospect to have been remarkably trivial. This questi on was decided on the merits. 35 The majority held that the charter government could impose martial law, but there was a strong dissent, mainly based on the Petition of Right. 36 In any event, there has never been any reason for saying, as has sometimes been held, 37 that any constitutional question arising under the Guarantee Clause is per se nonjusticiable. And a number of courts have occasionally recognized the Guarantee Clause as an appropriate basis of judicial decision, 38 as clearly suggested by Justice Sa muel Chase when John Adams was President. During the twentieth century, the Guarantee Clause has been a sleeping giant of the United States Constitution, yet there is no reason why, if the need becomes urgent in future years, the giant cannot be awakened and put to good use. The Fourteenth Amendment followed the American Civil War and has since been the main basis in the United States Constitution for judicial decisions restraining the exercise of police power by the several States. There are some well -kept secrets about the Fourteenth Amendment, which are highly pertinent to the question of police power, and these may conceivably become more widely understood or even become legal orthodoxy in the twenty -first century.

The first well -kept secret about the Fourteenth Amendment is found in the four dissenting votes to t he Slaughter House Cases , which rest mainly on the very capable and powerful opinions of Justice Stephen Field 41 and Justice Joseph Bradley. 42 Section 1 of the Four - teenth Amendment restrains the several States from abridging the privileges and immunities o f citizens of the United States. Most certainly these dissenters were right in maintaining that this clause serves to incorporate all guarantees of civil liberty found in the United States Constitution as further restraints on the several States, includin g the First through Ninth Amendments. 43 And in light of legal tradition, they were right in maintaining that the Fourteenth Amendment, by incorporating the Ninth Amendment, imposes the old Statute of Monopolies 44 upon the several States . Another well -kept s ecret about the Fourteenth Amendment, which may be unpleasant to some people yet ever so true, is that the article was never lawfully adopted, 45 mainly because it was proposed by a Congress which unlawfully excluded representatives and senators from ten Sta tes for having had the temerity of holding views not to the liking of an impassioned and factious majority. 46 Moreover, adoption was unlawful because ratification by those ten States, essential to adoption, was coerced by keeping them under martial law unt il they ratified, 47 contrary to principles already known and adjudicated to be unconstitutional. 48 Because time is a ________________________________ ________________________ 40.

The final well -kept secret about the Fourteenth Amendment is this: if and when it is finally acknowledged that the Fourteenth Amendment was never lawfully adopted, we shall not be deprived of means, under the fundamental law of the Un ion, to restrain the several States from acts of invidious discrimination or other forms of injustice. The reason is that everything worthwhile so far done in the name of the Fourteenth Amendment, and much more besides, can also be done upon a more enligh tened view of the American Revolu - tion, in the name of the Guarantee E unum. Annuit coeptis novus ordo seclorum. III. N ATURAL LAW JURISPRUDENCE Between now and the hopeful future of clearer vision, we can use principles common both to the Guarantee Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment as a constitutional restraint on the \"police power\" of the several States, and we may be guided by judicial decisions rendered under either provision. And for this purpose, especially as it relates to artif icial fluoridation of public water supplies, it is important to understand what has been done right, what has been done wrong, and why there has consequently been both progress and deteriora - tion in American jurisprudence. We first need to understand what has been done wrong and learn from it. With this objective in mind, we need to pay attention to Justice Hugo Black. During his tenure on the United States Supreme Court, Justice Black managed to sow more confusion, yet with important kernels of truth and distinguished erudition, than almost any judicial figure in the world during the twentieth century. His mistakes have pronounced characteristics which are particularly instructive when viewed in retrospect. His trademark position, stated in his famous di ssent in Adamson v. California ,50 was that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the ________________________________ ________________________ systematic evasion of t he question by the judiciary. See generally Texas v. White, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700 (1869); Georgia v. Stanton, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 50 (1868); Ex Parte McCardle, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 318 (1868); Ex Parte Yerger, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 85 (1868); Mississippi v. Johnso n, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475 (1867). 49. The possibilities for this development have already been considered in two articles by Arthur E. Bonfield, Baker v. Carr: New Light on the Constitutional Guarantee of Republican Government , 50 CAL. L. R EV. 245 (1962) a nd The Guarantee Clause of Article IV, Section 4: A Study in Constitutional Desuetude , 46 MINN . L. R EV. 513 (1962). 50. 332 U.S. 46, 68 -123 (1947). 206 J. LAND USE & ENVTL.

Throughout his dissent, Justice Black fairly radiated hosti lity against the ancient and venerable idea of natural law, 53 which he plainly did not understand either as a force shaping legal tradition or as a category of jurisprudence. 54 He acted as if the Ninth Amend - ment did not exist, because this article of funda mental law, con - strued in light of constitutional history, cannot possibly exclude those \"certain unalienable Rights\" with which all human beings are \"endowed by their Creator\" under the \"Laws of Nature and Nature's God.\" 55 Justice Black carried his hostil ity to natural law even further in his majority opinion in Ferguson v. Skrupa. 56 At issue in that case was a Kansas statute prohibiting any person from engaging in the busi - ness of debt adjusting, except as incident to the authorized practice of law. 57 At the time, there was a venerable precedent which held that, under the 14th Amendment, no State has constitutional author - ity to prohibit a useful business which is not inherently immoral or dangerous to public welfare. 58 Black flippantly overruled this old ________________________________ ________________________ 51. The historical evidence supporting this thesis is found in the appendix to Justice Black's opinion. See id. at 92 -123. 52. This provision was intended to meet the objection of Alexander Hamilton in T HE FEDERALIST NO. 84, at 513 -14 (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961), that an enumeration of rights was dangerous, because it might be used as a false pretext to clai m power for seizing rights not mentioned. See the observations of James Madison in the United States House of Representa - tives on June 8, 1789, recorded in 1 A NNALS OF CONGRESS 439-40 (Gales & Seaton 1834). 53. See Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. at 79 -80, 91. 54. Justice Black was plainly not aware of such distinguished works on natural law as HEINRICH A. R OMMEN , DIE EWIGE WIEDERKEHR DES NAT\u00dcRRECHTS (1936), translated as T HE NATURAL LAW (Thomas R. Hanley trans., 1955). Hanley's introduction movingly rela tes how Rommen as a lawyer in Nazi Germany discovered the reality of natural law and was led to reject legal positivism in resisting Hitler's violations of human rights. See id. at xi -xxxviii. 55. THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE para. 1, 2 (U.S. 1776).

See id. at 727. 58. See Adams v. Tanner, 244 U.S. 590 (1917). As with many other cases like it, this case turned on the clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which forbids any State from denying life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The clause is ultimately traceab le to the 39th Article of the Magna Carta of King John. It was probably added to the Fourteenth Amendment to cure the unfortunate holding of the majority in Satterlee v. Matthewson , 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 380 Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 207 case with the remark, \"Whether the legislature takes for its textbook Adam Smith, Herbert Spencer, Lord Keynes, or some other is no concern of ours.\" 59 Black's attitude was founded upon one of the most unfortunate falsehoods ever to pollute American jurisp rudence. He assumed, out of ignorance, that cases like Lochner v. New York ,60 were founded on political prejudice, not legal standards. In Lochner , the court held that a law limiting the right of bakers to contract for their hours of work was unconstituti onal. 61 No reason was even suggested on the record why bakers should not enjoy such discretion, or why they needed the protection of the law, as might have been true if, say, it had been shown that the bakers are typically in an uneven bargain - ing position in dealing with their employers. If such a showing had been at least attempted, as might well have been easily done, the statute would certainly have been upheld. 62 It is true that the freedom to contract, cited as the justification for holding the statut e unconstitutional, came from natural law jurispru - dence. But the theory was not woven out of thin air. It came from venerable and historic roots, ultimately the decision of Lord Mans - field in Sommersett's Case 63 which held that, because slavery runs against natural law, it could be sustained only by acts of Parliament, and all statutes allowing it had to be strictly construed so as to make a slave free the moment he set foot on the free soil of England. 64 ________________________________ ________________________ (1829), and drew inspiration from cases such as Univ ersity of North Carolina v. Fox , 5 N.C. (1 Mur.) 83 (1805). 59. 372 U.S. at 732. This remark echoed of the thoughtless satyrism of Oliver Wendell Holmes in Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45, 75 (1905) (\"The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spe ncer's Social Statics\"). Under this theory, we should be equally indifferent as to whether the legislature of a State were to take guidance from Maxmillien de Robespierre, Vladimir Lenin, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse Tung, or Pol Pot. 60. 198 U.S. 45 (1905). 61. See id. at 64 -65. 62. Pope Leo XIII issued the encyclical Rerum Novarum (1891), which was one of the greatest statements on natural law in history. He expounded rights of labor and the duty of governments to enact legislation protecting la bor from unjust exploitation. It was on this basis that legislation protecting labor from unjust exploitation was repeatedly approved as constitutional in natural law jurisprudence, whenever a plausible justification of legislative judgment was made to ap pear on the record. See, e.g., Bunting v. Oregon, 243 U.S. 426 (1917); Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908); Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366 (1898). 63. 20 How. St. Tr. l, 82 (K.B. 1771). 64. This principle originated in the policy of the common law which favored liberty, and thus nudged villeinage into extinction. See, e.g ., Pigg v. Caley, Noy 27 (K.B. 1618). Strict construction of laws allowing slavery was adopted by judges of the old South, and many slaves were freed because of it. See, e.g. , Murray v . M'Carty, 16 Va. (2 Mun.) 393 (1811). It was also applied by the circuit court of Missouri in granting Dred Scott and his family their freedom, and was the main basis of the dissent of Justice Benjamin Curtis in Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. (19 How.) 391, 602 -603 (1857). 208 J. LAND USE & ENVTL. L. [Vol. 14:2 This idea was, of course, adopted and expanded by the Thirteenth Amendment. It follows, by legal inference, that nobody in the United States may be denied a liberal right to earn a livelihood or to engage in business as he or she sees fit. Thus, it has been held under the Fourteenth Amendment that, unle ss a statute limiting the right of a citizen to contract freely can be plausibly justified, it is unconstitutional. 65 The idea does not embrace irresponsible freedom and it does not outlaw legislation to prevent unjust exploitation of labor or activity har mful to the public good. The right is confirmed by natural law and legal tradition and is suited to the circumstances of a free people. There has always been just cause to apply this notion with judicious caution, 66 but there never has been any reason to reject or overrule it altogether. 67 Black took his extremism to the ne plus ultra in his bitter dissent in Griswold v. Connecticut .68 Complaining that natural law is mysteri - ous and uncertain and that the Ninth Amendment has only nominal but no substantive meaning, Black insisted that even a statute intruding into the sexual intimacy of husband and wife, disallow ing them to be instructed by their physician on artificial methods of birth control, could not be struck down as unconstitutional. 69 Fortu nately, his fellow justices had no trouble in understanding privacy as a liberty protected by fundamental law, and they declared the statute unconstitutional. 70 ________________________________ ________________________ 65.

New York , 291 U.S. 502 (1934), is sometimes cited as the beginning of the end of natural law jurisprudence in the field of economic regulation, but the case is better understood as a just extension of Munn v. Illinois , 94 U.S. 113 (1877), in light of pr essing economic circumstances not existing at the time of Fairmont Creamery Co. v. Minnesota, 274 U.S. 1 (1926). Likewise, West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish , 300 U.S. 379 (1937), is often cited as the definitive end of natural law jurisprudence in the field of economic regulation. Yet in Parrish , the majority disregarded the intended meaning of the Nineteenth Amendment as expounded in Adkins v. Children's Hospital of the District of Columbia , 261 U.S. 525, 552 -53 (1923), and later revived Frontiero v. , 411 U.S. 677, 686 -88 (1977).

By acknowledging a constitutional right of privacy on the basis of natural law jurisprudence, the Court in no way committed itself to Roe v. Wad e, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), which did not rest on natural law jurisprudence but rather overthrew the traditional protection of the unborn by both the common law and the civil law. See e.g.,Thulluson v. Woodford, 4 Ves. Jr. 227, 321 -22 (Ch. 1799); Montreal Tra mways v. Leveille, [1933] 4 D. L. R. 337, 340 -41 (Can.). Nor did the Court contradict the moral teaching of Pope Paul VI against artificial birth control in the encyclical HUMANE VITAE (1968) . Natural Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 209 If Hugo Black condemned natural law because he did not under - stand it, the founding fathers of the Unite d States did understand it, and they built a new constitutional order upon it. They knew that natural law is a timeless moral and physical order which enforces itself and can be discovered by natural reason. 71 They knew that it constrains governments no l ess than markets. They knew that, if its lofty commands were disobeyed, there would be misfortunes in pub - lic affairs, requiring the accommodations of temporal law. They knew, therefore, that natural law was elaborated and given objective form by legal t radition. The dissenters in the Slaughter House Cases rested their erudite opinions on the facts of history. They did not make things up to suit their political fancies but relied instead on legal custom acknowl - edged by the King's Bench and an organic s tatute of the English Parliament. In light of long experience, it became clear in the past, as it is impossible to deny today, that, by the wonderful operation of unseen but undeniable forces of nature, the practice of monopoly creates painful economic co ngestions. So it was that legal tradition accommodated and expressed the reality of natural law. Likewise, if the statute in Griswold had not been left to fade in desuetude, but had been actively enforced, Connecticut would have faced political upheaval o r revolution. Hence, the reality of natural law, which, fortunately, did not produce unhappy consequences, but only because prosecutors had the good sense not to file accusations, and the statute was eventually found unconstitutional. In this way tempora l law honored privacy as an unenumerated constitutional immunity which had always existed by natural law. After transi - tions and adjustments, legal tradition will mature into a sturdier and sounder landmark which can be used with greater wisdom and confid ence in future years. IV. H EALTH FREEDOM One of the most distinguished civil liberties decisions of the twentieth century, never overruled and often cited, 72 rests on the ________________________________ ________________________ law jurisprudence actually restrains temporal law fro m attempting to prohibit some activities, especially those of a private nature, which, right or wrong, are not proper subjects for public regulation. See, e.g., THOMAS AQUINAS , SUMMA THEOLOGICA , Ia IIae, q. 93, art. 3, ad 3, translated in , BASIC WRITINGS OF SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS , 766 (Anton Pegis ed. 1945). 71. For abundant references to natural law, see the opening passages of THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE (U.S. 1776) and the corresponding language of Sir William Blackstone, supra note 27, at 38 -43. 72. See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 38l U.S. at 481 -82, 495, 502. 210 J. LAND USE & ENVTL. L. [Vol. 14:2 opinion of Justice James McReynolds in Meyer v. Nebraska .73 Citing the duty of govern ment to promote education, founded on the Northwest Ordinance, McReynolds struck down as unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment a law prohibiting the teaching of German to children in the primary grades of public schools in Nebraska. His general formula is particularly worthy of notice: While this court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much consideration, and some of the included things have been definitively stated. Without doubt, it d enotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint, but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations in life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, to establish a home and bring up children, to worship God accordin g to the dictates of conscience, and, generally, to enjoy privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.74 It is noteworthy that Sir William Blackstone mentioned the \"preservation of man's health from such practices as may prejudice or annoy it\" not as a legislative power, but as among \"absolute rights of individuals,\" 75 -- in other words, as among \"those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free me n.\"76 Therefore, it is clear enough that there are natural rights pro - tected by fundamental law, even if not constitutionally enumerated. As there are such natural rights to marry and have children, to seek knowledge, to enjoy personal privacy, and to ear n a livelihood by honest work of choice, subject only to such regulation as may be reasonably needed to protect the rights of others and the common good, so too there is a domain of personal freedom, which limits the \"police power\" of a State in regulating health. It is an area given some but not full judicial development in the twentieth century. Two classic cases stand out like beacons, the first being Jacobson v. Massachusetts ,77 in which a citizen challenged a statute compelling small pox vaccinations t o counteract a pending epidemic of deadly disease. The act of the legislature was upheld under the Fourteenth Amendment. The holding is understandable, because the statute ad - dressed a public danger, and failure to comply might have tangibly ________________________________ ________________________ 73. 261 U.S. 390 (1923). 74.

Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 211 increased th e chances that an offender might become a carrier of disease which thereby could infect others. Public emergency has always justified intrusions, even upon incomplete knowledge, which normal situations will not. Of much interest in this case is the discus sion of the fact that, while the general belief of the legislature on the need for smallpox vaccinations was supported by respectable medical authority, there was nevertheless responsible dissent within the medical profession over the efficacy and in some degree even of the safety of this particular measure. In Jacobson, the court reasoned, \"The possibility that the belief [favoring smallpox vaccinations] may be wrong, and that science may yet show it to be wrong is not conclusive; for the legislature has the right to pass laws which, according to [reasonable belief] are adapted to prevent the spread of contagious diseases.\" 78 No less of interest is an exception to the general principle of the judgment. The court plainly said that the statute could never b e interpreted to compel a vaccination where it could be shown \"with reasonable certainty\" that application of the statute to an objecting citizen \"would seriously impair his health or probably cause his death.\" 79 This observation was added as an essential feature of the ratio decidendi to avoid misinterpretation. The court did not define what exactly it meant in saying that a statutory regulation of public health may not be extended to situations in which serious impairment of personal health is shown with \"reasonable certainty.\" But this characteristic phrase has long been a term of art in the law of damages. It has long been used to describe the legal standard of proving an injury in civil proceedings: while damages may not be based on speculation or gue ss, it will be enough to show the approximate degree of harm by fair preponder - ance of the evidence adduced in a judicial hearing. 80 And, in such ________________________________ ________________________ 78. Id. at 35. Language has been substituted in bracket s for the phrase \"the common belief of the people\" in the opinion, because the obvious intent of the court was that the belief of the legislature acting on behalf of the people must at least be reasonable in view of available knowledge and evidence. The c ourt said, \"if a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the public morals, or the public safety, has no real or substantial relation to those objects,\" then it is the duty of the judiciary to intervene and declare such statut e unconstitutional.

Forest Hill ,82 in which the majority opinion was written by Justice Ivan Rand, who was probably the most eminent jurist on the Supreme Court of Canada, in any event one of the finest natural law judges in the world, during the twentieth century. 83 This case arose under the British North America Act of 1867, before it was possible, except on a very limited basis, 84 for the judiciary of Canada to strike down acts of the dominion Parliament or of the provincial Legislatures as unconstitutional and thus null and void. 85 The judici - ary of Canada was then obliged to protect civil liberties by strict con - struction of statutes, as far as possible, so as to avoid co llision with natural law and legal tradition. 86 It was by using such conservative yet effective principles that Justice Rand became distinguished as a civil libertarian on the bench. ________________________________ ________________________ 81.

Quebec , [1953] 4 D.L.R. 641 (Can.). 85. The situation has since changed beginning with the Canadian Bill of Rights of 1960, an organic statute of the dominion Parliament, which unlike the English Bill of Rights of 1689, was more th an a venerable guide for the interpretation of statutes. In Queen v. Drybones [1970] 9 D.L.R. 3d 473 (Can.), the Canadian Bill of Rights of 1960 was held to be a statutory directive to restrain federal laws from operation. Later came the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms consisting of sections 1 through 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982, which restrains the federal and provincial governments, and cannot be repealed by legislative act. Even so, section 33 of the Constitution Act of 1982 concedes to legislative power the prerogative of making statutes operable for five -year intervals, notwithstanding important provisions of the Canadian Charter. The Constitution Act of 1982 is part of the Canada Act of 1982, an organic statute of the British Parliame nt which renounced the last vestiges of imperial control over Canada. 86. Lord Coke held in Dr. Bonham's Case, 8 Coke 114a (C.P. 1610), that the courts of common law could declare acts of Parliament null and void. This doctrine was overthrown on the weigh t of the principle that the Commons, Lords, and King in Parliament are omnipotent and sovereign, and that, therefore, the judiciary cannot declare an act of Parliament null and void. Even so, the judges can and must construe acts in keeping with the princ iple that the King can do no wrong, and thus that all acts of Parliament must be construed, if possible, in keeping with natural law and legal tradition. The judges should do so, even if they must read statutes quoad hoc or contrary to their literal meani ng in unusual situations. See, e.g ., BLACKSTONE , supra note 27, at 91, 160, 246. Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 213 In Forest Hill , a provincial law allowed municipal corporations to treat public water supplies so as to make the vended water \"pure and wholesome.\" 87 Justice Rand construed this statute strictly, so as to disallow fluoridation. He protested, But it is not to promote the ordinary use of water as a physical requisite for the bod y that fluoridation is proposed. That process has a distinct and different purpose; it is not a means to an end of wholesome water for water's function but to an end of a special health purpose for which water supply is made use of as a means.88 Similar la nguage appears in the concurring opinion of Justice Cartwright, regarding the municipal by -law to initiate fluoridation then in question: In pith and substance the by -law relates not to the provision of a water supply but to the compulsory preventative med ication of the inhabitants of the area. In my opinion, the words of the statutory provisions on which the appellant relies do not confer upon the council the power to make by -laws in relation to matters of this sort.89 Jacobson and Forest Hill expound comp lementary principles of natural law jurisprudence, and thereby supply a cogent idea of health freedom which is inherent in the respected constitutional formulation expressed in Meyer v. Nebraska .90 Under the Guarantee Clause, the Ninth Amendment, and the Fourteenth Amendment, understood in light of natural law and legal tradition, \"police power\" to regulate public health includes discre - tion to compel submission of citizens to medical intervention, but only if three necessary conditions are met. First, legi slative judgment underlying the statute may discount responsible professional dissent, yet must at least rest upon reasonable medical or scientific evidence. Second, it must be fairly justified by grave cause or public emer - gency, such as the need to preve nt the spread of a contagious disease.

This much is the ideal of natural law jurisprudence which is inseparable from the intended meaning of the United States Constitution. V. T HE KEY DECISIONS SUSTAINING FLUORIDATIO N It is not our purpose to provide a general review of all judicial decisions that have touched upon the constitutionality of imposing fluoridation on the general public. 91 Suffice it to say that the great majority of cases sustain it, we think wrongly, bu t there can be no doubt about the clear trend of American jurisprudence. Our objective here is to note highly important developments in the last twenty -five years, which strenuous efforts have been made to camouflage behind smiling propaganda orchestrated by the ADA and the USPHS to promote fluoridation, as if all were well. In fact an end to this episode of public health malpractice is foreseeable. If we consider scientific and legal revolutions of the past, say from the discovery of the true cause of pu erperal fever by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweiss until his eventual posthumous vindication, or in the development of freedom of the press from the founding of the Star Chamber to the adoption of the First Amendment, we should not be astonished to see the passing of considerable time in the rise and fall of fluoridation, and not a little confusion along the way. Among all others, the most distinguished judgment sustaining the constitutionality of mandatory fluoridation of public water sup - plies has always been, and st ill is Paduano v. City of New York ,92 which arose upon a suit brought in 1965 to enjoin the practice in New York City. 93 At that time the clear weight of available medical and scientific evidence, then respectable but long since shown to be unfounded, 94 sugg ested that fluoridation was effective in reducing tooth decay in children. 95 Evidence of potential danger then ________________________________ ________________________ 91.

Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 215 existed, 96 but it was little known, in an undeveloped state, and effec - tively concealed by ADA -USPHS disinformation. 97 Most physicians and dentist s then believed that fluoridation was beneficial and safe. It is fair to say that most available evidence -- at least what could be easily orchestrated into a courtroom appearance of the most avail - able evidence -- then suggested that fluoridation was ben eficial and safe. True enough, then available evidence suggested the need for caution among the wise. But there were not many in those days who had good credentials, independent means, leisure time for deep study, the persuasiveness to expose the slick sa les pitches of ADA - USPHS spokesmen, the capacity to survive assaults on their careers and reputations mounted by fluoridation promoters, 98 -- and wisdom besides. It is wrong to justify fluoridation by reference to Jacobson , because fluoridation, unlike smal l pox vaccinations, does not address a contagious disease, but it is at least understandable that the Supreme Court of New York should have cited it as persuasive legal authority. 99 The court said: The question of the desirability of fluoridation is immate rial. In the face of the overwhelming precedents previously cited, and in accordance with general principles of stare decisis, this court sitting at Special Term, feels constrained to deny plaintiffs' application for a temporary injunction and to grant de fendants' motion for a dismissal of the complaint. Until the scientific evidence as to the dele - terious effects of fluoridation reaches beyond the purely speculative state now existing , decisional law mandates the holding that the contro - versy should rema in within the realm of the legislative and executive branches of government. While the courts do not have a right to impose fluoridation upon anyone, judicial restraint requires us to adhere to the uniform decisions holding that the executive and legislat ive branches of government do -- at least until some proof is adduced that fluoridation has harmful side effects and therefore is not in the interests of the community.100 The court obviously had in mind the qualifying dictum in Jacobson that a public health regulation, obliging a citizen to accept a ________________________________ ________________________ 96.

The state board of health sued the municipal government which pleaded the express and formal protest of the residents and voters of the city, the want of a public emergency occasioned by a pending epidemic of contagious disease, the existen ce of a responsible medi - cal and scientific controversy over the effectiveness and safety of fluoridation, the availability of fluoride to persons desiring it by less intrusive means, and, therefore, the invasion of a natural right of the people, protected by fundamental law under these circumstances, to enjoy freedom of choice in maintaining personal health. 103 The Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the mandatory fluoridation law, and sustained the writ of mandamus ordering city officer s to implement the statute. 104 But there was a compelling dissent that speaks to the future. 105 If it can be established \"with reasonable certainty\" that fluorida - tion is dangerous to human health, and has caused massive injury to ________________________________ ________________________ 101. 241 N.W.2d 624, 626 (Minn. 1976), appeal dismissed 429 U.S. 803 (1976). 102.

VI. T HE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE The question now to be addressed is whether, in keeping with Jacobson and Paduano , it can be proved with \"reasonable certainty\" in judicial proceedings that fluoridation is dangerous to public health by causing cancer and other ailments in man. In assessing trends in human cancer, we have two main sources of information which can be used as evidence. Laboratory studies enable us to view a disease at the molecular and cellular levels, and to con sider reactions in living plants, insects and animals. The advantage of laboratory studies is that precise experimental conditions can be designed and implemented to control for known and unknown variables, which is critical in the identifica - tion of caus al operations in the empirical sciences. 106 Whatever legitimate doubt may once have been voiced on the subject, it is now abundantly clear that a significant body of laboratory research reveals carcinogenic potential in fluoride artificially introduced in water at 1.0 ppm. 107 The disadvantage of laboratory studies is that some caution is required in extrapolating results to human beings, and here is where epidemiology comes into the picture. Epidemiology is the branch of medicine which studies the diseases of man in his actual environ - ment. If the controls in epidemiological surveys are not as precise, the results are more pertinent to human experience. Therefore, both laboratory studies and epidemiological surveys can profitably be considered together, and, when parallels between them become ________________________________ ________________________ 106.

[Vol. 14:2 striking, causal relationships between agents in the environment and human disease can be more readily identified and explained. Hence the question: Has the carcinogenic potential of fluoride observed in laboratory stu dies been reflected in human experience? The answer, based on very extensive epidemiological data, is cer - tainly in the affirmative. 108 This fact removes the speculative character of objections previously expressed by physicians and other learned persons w hen the world first hailed fluoride as a wonder of modern science. The leader in gathering pertinent epidemiological data and organizing it in a usable form was Dr. Dean Burk, who retired in 1974 as the head of the cytochemistry section of the National Can cer Institute (NCI) of the United States. 109 In his time, he was one of the most famous cancer research scientists in the world. He was well read, highly cultured, disarmingly humble, and had a delicious sense of humor. But standing out above every other trait was his ability to view a problem of empirical observation with clear insight and to give reality, as he put in conversation with those who knew him, \"the simplest rational expression.\" 110 The epidemiological work here in question was done under the direction of Dr. Burk from his retirement until his death in 1988. As with so much of his work before his retirement, he was years ahead of his time.

Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 219 organized under the direction of Dr. Burk, showing a striking association between fluoridation and cancer. 111 It is important to appreciate the basic data, because it was the principal and decisive focus of the judicial hearings that followed. 112 The year -by-year average observed cancer death rates of ten large central cities of the United States, which served as the control group and remained unfluoridated from 1940 through 1968, were com - pared for the years 1940 through 1968 with the year -by-year a verage observed cancer death rates of ten large central cities of the United States which served as the experimental group and remained unfluoridated from 1940 through 1951, but fluoridated between 1952 and 1956, and remained fluoridated through 1968 and t hereafter. 113 The experiment came to an end in 1968 because fluoridation was introduced in the control cities step -by-step from and after 1969. The necessary data are available for all years except for 1951 and 1952. The central cities in question are all very large, comparable in size, and spread out across the whole country. In the control group were: Los Angeles, Boston, New Orleans, Seattle, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Kansas City (Missouri), Columbus (Ohio), Newark, and Portland. 114 In the experimental group were: Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland, Washington D.C., Milwaukee, St. Louis, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Buffalo. 115 Roughly speaking, the comparison is between about seven million people in the ten control cities and about eleven million people in the ten experimental cities over about thirty years. 116 There has hardly ever been a published epidemiological study using so much data, arranged in such powerful experimental design. The basic data can be expressed as unweighted averages (giving each city equal weight, regardless of size) and as weighted averages (giving each city weight according to size). All cancer death rates here discussed are expressed as so many cancer deaths per 100,000 persons. ________________________________ ________________________ 111 . See 121 CONG .

[Vol. 14:2 The basic data are given in detail in the appe ndix of this article. 117 For the sake of convenience an observed or crude cancer death rate for all sites in an entire population will be designated as CDRo. It does not matter in this case whether unweighted or weighted aver - ages are used. The pattern is numerically and visibly the same, and the differences emerging from mathematical analysis of the figures for the two types of averages are trivial. Either way the possibility of chance occurrence is far less than 1 in 1000. The weighted averages will be used here because weighted averages have been used by all critics of Dr. Burk's work, and Dr. Burk frequently used weighted averages himself. The data are arranged in standard experimental design, com - paring like with like along a base line from 1940 -50 in which cancer death rates grew equally, then continuing the comparison after fluoridation was introduced in the experimental cities. It was after fluoridation began that there was a pronounced acceleration in cancer mortality in the experimental group (+ F) as compared with the control group ( -F). The resulting association between fluoridation and cancer can be conveniently quantified by linear regression 118 analysis for the data for 1940 -50, also for 1953 -68 then extending the resulting lines to achieve va lues for 1950 and 1970: 119 1940 1950 the association between fluoridation and cancer can be expressed as follows: ca ncer deaths per 100,000 persons ________________________________ ________________________ 117.

The basic data can be recapitulated by any informed and impartial investigator drawing from census figures and vital statistics published by the government of the United States. 118. Linear regression is a standard technique in statistics for characterization of a field of points on a two -dimensional graph as a straight line. This line is so drawn that the sum of the squares of the distances of the several points to the line is the lowest possible number. Such line is assumed in the product moment formula for the linear correlation coefficient, designated \"r\" to express the degree of association between the two axes. By use of related operations, a statistical confidence level, represent ed by the coefficient \"P\" can be derived. P determines the extent to which an observed association may or may not have occurred by chance. The subject is discussed in standard textbooks. See, e.g. , SIR AUSTIN BRADFORD -HILL, A SHORT TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL STATISTICS 161 -67, 173 -80 (10th ed. 1977); MURRAY SPIEGEL , THEORY AND PROBLEMS OF STATISTICS 218-20, 226 -28, 244 -45, 253 -54 (1961). 119.

Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 221 exposed within fifteen to twenty years after fluoridation began in the experimental group of cities. If this figure is multiplied against 130 million Americans who have been drinking fluoridated water over the past fifteen to twenty years or more, an excess of over 40,000 cancer deaths in the United States every year is attributable to fluoridation. Not long after the foregoing figures were first called to the public's attention, Dr. Burk was called to testify before Congres s on April 6, 1976. And testify he did: Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., M.D., of Civil War medical fame, and professor of anatomy at Harvard University, in 1843 and 1855 described then prevailing treatment of puerperal fever in lying -in hospitals as criminal m anslaughter. It was only manslaughter, however, not murder because the physicians of that day did not have, and could not have had a sufficiently knowledgeable idea of the bacteriological basis of the doctor -nurse -patient transmission of the disease until the work of Pastuer and Lister decades later. The scientific and medical status of artificial fluoridation or public water supplies has now advanced to the stage of the possibility of socially imposed mass murder on an unexpectedly large scale involving t ens of thousands of cancer deaths of Americans annually.120 The shock resulting from this firm statement by a world - renowned cancer research scientist evoked an emergency response from the USPHS. Needles to say, the USPHS did not admit that they had exposed the American people to an environmental hazard which produced \"tens of thousands of cancer deaths of Americans annually.\" As night follows day, they claimed that Dr. Burk had failed to take elementary precautions. 121 Their pretext was that he and his assoc iates had not adjusted the basic data for age, race and sex, and that, when such adjustments were done, there was no association between fluoridation and cancer. 122 Their claim essentially was that, among 18 million people in twenty large cities over thirty years, it so happened that the ________________________________ ________________________ 120.

[Vol. 14:2 experimental cities grew older faster just as they were fluoridated, and that this aging occurred precisely to the extent necessary to create the shocking appearance of an association between fluoridation and cancer. 123 This association, they held, was merely an illusion deceiv ing the ignorant. It sounds far -fetched. It was worse than far -fetched. It is obligatory to note that Dr. Burk and those working with him adjusted for demographic variables on numerous occasions. 124 Beyond his published scholarship, he repeatedly gave detailed testi - mony on these questions in public hearings 125 and courts of justice. 126 But his view was that the basic data are best not adjusted in this particular case, because the base line established by the data for 1940 through 1950 already controls for all known and unknown variables. 127 Cancer incidence and mortality are influenced by countless demographic, environmental, dietary, socio -economic, and other fac - tors, some tending to increase, others tendi ng the decrease the extent of the disease. It is known, for example, that older people tend to experience more cancer than younger people, yet good diet and environment can significantly offset the effects of age. Adjustments for age in particular, and pe rhaps also for race and sex, may be important in comparing two populations at one point in time, because such adjustments may serve as a control for such demo - graphic variables. 128 Yet a very different situation emerges when, as ________________________________ ________________________ 123. See id. at 80 -83 (statement of Dr. Robert Hoover, NCI). 124. Dr. Burk's interest in such adjustments first surfaced at the meeting of the American Society of Biological Chemists in San Fransisco on June 6 -10, 1976, where he joined Dr. John Yiamouyiannis in a paper setting forth partial adjustments of the basic data for age and race by the dire ct method. See Dean Burk & John Yiamouyiannis, Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies and Cancer Death Rates , 35 FED. PROC . AM. SOC. BIOL. CHEM . 1707, (1976). Dr. Burk's more advanced adjustments of the basic data for demographic variables absorbed twelve years of his life's work and included, among others, articles published by the International Society of Fluoride Research and the Pennsylvania Academy of Science. See Burk & Yiamouyiannis, supra note 108; Burk & Graham, supra note 108; Burk, Graham, & Mo rin, supra note 108. He was the major inspiration of these several articles. His matured views are best expressed in the last, published in 1988 not long before his death. 125. For example, see his formal statement to a hearing panel of the EPA on June 17 , 1985, including nineteen tables outlining multiple adjustments by the indirect method for age, race and sex, reprinted in NATIONAL FLUORIDATION NEWS , Vol. XXXI, no. 4 (1985). 126.

Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 223 in the case of the basic dat a here in question, there is a comparison of trends over time, including a long base line. 129 There are established principles of inductive logic which are associated historically with William of Ockham 130 and Sir Isaac Newton. 131 They are used in the empirical sciences for the discovery or identification of causes in nature. Given a strong trend or association observed in nature, take the simplest and most fitting explanation as the cause, unless and until the contrary be shown. Likewise, attribute like cause s to like effects, unless and until the contrary be shown. Finally, where cause and effect in certain circumstances are fairly ascertained by proper experiment, such cause and effect may be generalized throughout the universe, unless and until the contrar y be shown. Given these principles of natural reason, and given what is known about fluoride, including especially its demonstrated carcino - genic potential, 132 the simplest and most fitting explanation of the basic data is that all cancer -influencing factors counterbalanced each other during the long base line period before 1950; that all these factors continued to counterbalance each other after 1950 except for the one factor known to be new, viz., fluoridation; and that, therefore, the entire observed assoc iation between fluoridation and cancer in the basic data, i.e., 31.3 excess CDs/100,000 after 15 -20 years of exposure, is attributable to fluoridation as the cause. 133 We can then generalize by saying that artificial fluoridation of public water supplies ca uses an immense amount of cancer in the United States, \"involving tens of thousands of cancer deaths of Americans annually.\" Adjustments for age, race, and sex are here meant to account for demographic factors which have already been addressed by the base line. Such adjustments will therefore tend to control more than once ________________________________ ________________________ 129. See, e.g. , Burk & Graham, supra note 108, at 65; Burk, Grah am, & Morin, supra note 108, at 140. 130. Ockham's emphasis on the simplest explanation as the best explanation, often called \"Ockham's razor,\" grew out of his philosophical treatment of universals, relations, causation, and motion. See COPLESTON , supra note 106, pt. I, at 69 -71, 80 -81, 83 -88. 131. At the beginning of the third book of his PHILOSOPHIAE NATURALIS PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA , Sir Isaac Newton laid down his \"rules of reasoning in natural philosophy\"for the identification of causes in phenomenal reali ty, including the simplicity principle, some - times called \"Ockham's Razor.\" See 5 COPLESTON , A H ISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY , pt.

[Vol. 14:2 for the same factors and so, in this context, will tend to understate reality. Changes in the demographic composition of the control and experimental cities have in some degree been cou nteracted by other factors, and the adjusted figures will not reflect this counteracting effect. So again, adjustments will tend to understate reality. Dr. Burk respected conventional opinion, but he did not adore it. And since conventional opinion deman ds adjustments for age, race, and sex, not because he thought they clarified the meaning of the basic data, he cheerfully went along. It is ironic that the scientist who thought these adjustments least useful did more than all others to assure that they w ere properly done. His guiding principle in dealing with the subject was that, if adjustments were to be executed, they should rest upon standard methods, and be carried out as comprehensively and thoroughly as possible, otherwise not at all. It is no les s ironic that the attack against his epidemiological work was spearheaded by the National Cancer Institute which he had served with such distinction before his retirement. The confrontation initially developed in hearings on September 21 and October 12, 19 77, in Congress. 134 In these hearings, the National Cancer Institute came forth with its objections in a definitive, 17 -page document. 135 It was presented under the signature of the director Dr. Arthur Upton, and introduced in committee by the deputy director Dr. Guy Newell. This \"Upton Statement\" was then and still is the official position of the govern - ment of the United States. It is reputed to be the irrefutable answer to the thesis of Dr. Burk and his colleagues. The scientific debate since then has tu rned upon the Upton Statement, which lays down a characteristic adjustment of the basic data for age, race, and sex by the indirect method, an orthodox procedure for this purpose. 136 In this procedure, we ordinarily compare two populations at a certain point in time in terms of the ratio of the observed cancer death rate (which we have called CDRo) to the \"index\" or \"expected\" cancer death rate (which we shall call CDRe) of each population. In deriving an \"expected\" CDR, we ascertain from census figures the n umber of persons in each demographic category of the observed populations. In addressing Dr. Burk's basic data, the staff at NCI ________________________________ ________________________ 134. The key contributions of historic significance on both sides are reprinted in National Cancer Program , supra note 109, at 3 -60, 75 -83, 98 -140, 181 -212, 219 -30, 305 -18 (1 977). 135. See id. at 104 -20. 136. See BRADFORD -HILL, supra note 118, at 190 -96. Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 225 used forty such categories, viz., age groups 0 -4, 5-14, 15 -24, 25 -34, 35 - 44, 45 -54, 55 -64, 65 -74, 75 -84, and 85+, each divided into white male, white female, nonwhite male, and nonwhite female. We must then select a \"standard population,\" drawn from census figures and vital statistics for a certain territory and year: this standard population really consists of a set of known can cer death rates for each category in the population. The choice of this standard population requires some judgment. The staff at NCI selected the United States in 1950, 137 which is not, in our view, an unreasonable choice, because it represents a fair esti mate of what cancer experience should be, category by category, in the absence of anything tending to make cancer deaths higher or lower than usual. For each population compared, the number of persons in each category is multiplied by the corresponding rat e in the standard population. Expected cancer deaths so determined are added up, then divided by the total population, and reduced to a common denominator of 100,000. The resulting \"expected\" CDR will be what may be anticipated for the population in view of its demographic composition. The fraction CDRo/CDRe is called a standardized mortality ratio or SMR. If based on good judgment, it will indicate the extent to which the observed cancer death rate of a given population is higher or lower than what sh ould be expected under normal circumstances in view of its demographic structure. The Upton Statement sets forth an adjustment of the basic data expressed in weighted averages. The SMRs are as follows: 138 1950 1970 Change CDRo/CDRe 1.23 1.24 +.0l CDRo/CDRe 1.15 1.l7 +.02 Using these figures, the NCI asked Congress to believe that, relative to what may be expected in light of the age structure of the two groups of cities observed, cancer mortality actually grew 1% faster in the unfluoridated cities than in the fluoridated cities. 139 ________________________________ ________________________ 137.

[Vol. 14:2 Dr. Burk and his coll eagues had a remarkable answer: 140 The available and pertinent data for the years after 1950, were 1953 -1968. Without the trends in these years, nobody would suspect that there is a causal relationship between fluoridation and cancer. In its adjustment, th e NCI considered l950 before fluoridation began in the experimental cities, and 1970 after fluoridation had already been initiated in the control cities, and did not consider the years 1953 - 1968 which were the whole basis of concern. In other words, the N CI simply derived their CDRo values from data reported for 1950 and 1970, and ignored all else, as if 1953 -1968 were unimportant. Having omitted all available and pertinent data in their adjustment, it is not surprising that the NCI came up with the wrong answer. In the same hearings before Congress, it was demonstrated by a colleague of Dr. Burk that, if the adjustment proposed by the NCI is undertaken using all available and pertinent data after 1950, there emerges an impressive association between fluor idation and age-race-sex adjusted cancer mortality. 141 Dr. Burk developed even more comprehensive adjustments. In doing so, he considered the years before and after 1950, because the ________________________________ ________________________ 140. See id. at 64 -65. See also Burk & Graham, supra note 108, at 67 -68; Burk, Graham, & Morin, supra note 108, at 142 -43. 141. Dr. John Yiamouyiannis executed an adjustment of the basic data, using weighted averages and US -1950 as the standard population, exactly as stipulated in the Upton Statement. He adjusted only for the years after 1950, deriving CDRo values for 1950 and 1970, by linear regression analysis of the CDRo data for 1950 and 1953 -1969, and showed an association in terms of CDRo/CDRe = +.042, and in terms of CDRo -CDRe = 12.4 cancer deaths per 100,00 persons exposed within after fifteen to twenty years after the introduction of fluoridation in the experimental cities. See National Cancer Program , supra note 109, at 64 -65. The main objection to this technique came from Dr. Da vid Newell of the Royal Statistical Society in defense of the Upton Statement. He claimed that, because populations between census years and thus denominators in intercensal CDRs must be estimated by linear interpolation, they are not reliable data, and t herefore not suitable for linear regression analysis. See Aitkenhead v. Borough of West View, No. GD -4585, Trial Transcript, May 8, 1978, at 72, 72A, 73 -76 (Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, Pa.). This criticism was exploded by none other than Dr. Guy Newell, Deputy Director of the NCI, who supervised preparation of the Upton Statement and introduced it before Congress. Later speaking as a professor of epidemiology at the University of Texas, he stated emphatically that use of linear interpolation to derive denominators in intercensal CDRs is \"accepted procedure\" in modern applied epidemiology, and, therefore, perfectly reliable. See Safe Water Found. of Texas v. City of Houston, No. 80 - 52271, Trial Transcript, Jan. 26, 1982, at 1648 -54 (151st Jud . Dist., Tex.). The correctness of undertaking a linear regression analysis of intercensal CDRs in which the denominators were estimated by linear interpolation was further confirmed by Dr. Hubert Arnold, professor of statistics at the University of Calif ornia, Davis. See National Cancer Program, supra note 109, at 580. The propriety and necessity of such use of interpolated data, based on fundamental principles of inductive logic, is discussed in Burk & Graham, supra note 108, at 68 -69, and Burk, Graham , & Morin, supra note 108, at 143 -44. Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 227 observed CDRs portray a change in trends after 1950 and a change from trend s before 1950. 142 The data representing 1953 -1968 were important, but they were especially important in view of what happened in 1940 -1950. The need to consider the years before and after 1950 became clearer from the fact that there were demographic fluctu ations before and after 1950: it appeared that these fluctuations both before and after 1950 could materially influence the size the association adjusted for age, race, and sex. Dr. Burk derived CDRo values for 1940 and 1950 by linear regression analysis o f the data for 1940 -1950, and for 1950 and 1970 by linear regression analysis of the data for 1953 -1968. 143 He derived CDRe values, using US -1950 as the standard population, exactly as stipulated in the Upton statement. 144 He used the SMR or CDRo/CDRe, and a lso the difference between observed and expected CDRs, i.e., CDRo -CDRe, which is also used by conventional epidemiologists. 145 His results can be summarized as follows: 146 Cities 1940 1950 1950 figures can be transformed into coefficients whic h reflect an association between fluoridation and CDRs adjusted for age, race, and sex, as it developed from 1940 to 1970: ________________________________ ________________________ 142. On the importance of adjusting both for the period before fluoridation was be gun in the experimental cities and the period after, then reaching a combined result, see Burk & Graham, supra note 108, at 67, and Bu rk, Graham, & Morin, supra note 108, at 142 -43. 143. See Burk & Graham, supra note 108, at 67; Burk, Graham, & Morin, supra note 108, at 142. 144. The particulars of the NCI adjustments are laid out more clearly in the paper of the Royal Statistical Society defending the Upton Statement. See National Cancer Program , supra note 109, at 224 -29. 145. See id. at 227 -28 (Royal Statistical Society). 146. See Burk & Graham, supra note 108, at 67 -68. Dr. Burk preferred another similar adjustment based on the indirec t method, using weighted averages, and US -1940 as the standard population, then combining the impact of changes both before and after 1950 in \"time independent\" terms. This adjustment yields the conclusion that 69.2% of the observed association between fl uoridation and cancer, as reflected in the basic data, cannot be explained by demographic differences. See Burk, Graham, & Morin, supra note 108, at 142 -43. 228 J. LAND USE & ENVTL. L. [Vol. 14:2 change This coefficient means that, relative to what might be expected in light of the demographic structure of the two populations here in question, adjusted cancer mortality grew about 9% faster in the fluoridated cities. In terms of CDRo -CDRe, fluoridation is associated with [(47.9 - -28.1)] + [(26.1 -13.2) - (34.9 -25.8)] = 17.6 excess cancer deaths per 100,000 persons exposed after 15 -20 years. This adjusted figure, multiplied against 130 million Americans now drinking fluoridated water 15 -20 yea rs, works out to something on the order of 23,000 excess cancer deaths every year in the United States. Whether adjusted or unadjusted figures are preferred, the size of the human casualty is so large and tragic that it is almost indecent to quibble over t he numbers. Over twenty years have passed, and the casualty has mounted, since the NCI represented to Congress, on the basis of demographic adjustments which left out all available and pertinent data, that there is no association between fluoridation and cancer. VII. T HE JUDICIAL FINDINGS CONDEMNING FLUORIDATION In the wake of the hearings in Congress just discussed, litigation seeking to resist or restrain further implementation of fluoridation began in several places in the United States. In Ohio it ha d recently been held that fluoridation was a constitutional exercise of police power. 147 But in light of the recent publication of the basic data gathered under the direction of Dean Burk, opportunities for a new judicial hearing vastly improved. When such a hearing was sought, the Ohio Supreme Court commented: A more difficult question is raised by the claim that fluoride is a carcinogen based on statistics that the cancer death rate has increased in certain cities with fluoridated water, while remaining the same in certain other cities which do not fluoridate. The evidence for this claim has not been tested by litigation and is disputed by other authorities. This evidence has also been submit - ted to federal agencies and to the Congress. If scientificall y proved, these claims could raise legitimate questions as to the constitu - tionality of fluoridation as a public health measure, and, since these claims are based upon very recent studies, the purposes underlying ________________________________ ________________________ 147.

Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 229 the principle of res judicata would probabl y not be served by barring litigation to determine the validity of these claims.148 Reading this statement side by side with Jacobson v. Massachu - setts,149 and Paduano v. City of New York 150, a suit before the judiciary attacking the constitutionality of mandato ry fluoridation should succeed if it could be established by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the measure causes or contributes to the cause of cancer in man. But the court held that the judiciary had no original jurisdiction to consider the ques tion, ostensibly because, in Ohio, the power to find the facts was vested by statute in an administrative agency. 151 The holding seems to have been created post hoc to avoid a touchy question. It would have been easy for the court to rely on respectable authority to the effect that, where a constitutional question is fairly raised, and the outcome depends on facts, especially where personal rights are involved, exhaustion of administrative remedies is not necessary, and the judiciary can take jurisdiction to hear the evidence and decide the controversy on the merits. 152 No further headway was made in Ohio because the plaintiffs too well understood that impartial consideration by the administrative agency, where fluori - dation was institutional policy, was as ho peless as an unbiased attitude by the NCI and other institutes in the USPHS. A. The Pittsburgh Case However, it was not necessary to wait very long for the opportunity to be fairly heard on the new evidence in Pittsburgh in the case of Aitkendead v. Boro ugh of West View .153 The case was assigned to Judge John Flaherty who has since become the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania. The suit rested on a theory of nuisance, and went to hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction.

[Vol. 14:2 Physicians appeared to oppose the testimony of Dr. Burk and his colleagues, as had occurred in Congress. 154 After many sessions, followed by exten sive summations on both sides, Judge Flaherty made his findings on November 16, 1978. He first described the main evidence by stating: Over the course of five months, the court held periodic hearings which consisted of extensive expert testimony from as f ar away as England. At issue was the most recent time trend study of Dr. Burk and Dr. Yiamouyiannis, which compared the cancer mortality of 10 cities which fluoridated their water systems with 10 cities which did not fluoridate over a period of 28 years f rom 1940 to 1968. The study concluded that there was a significant increase in cancer mortality in the fluoridated cities.155 He defined the sole issue of fact as \"whether fluoride may be a carcinogen.\" 156 He then found that \"[p]oint by point, every critici sm made of the Burk -Yiamouyiannis study was met and explained by the plaintiffs. Often, the point was turned around against defen - dants. In short, this court was compellingly convinced of the evidence in favor of plaintiffs.\" 157 Judge Flaherty entered a pr eliminary injunction. Since the facts of the case had been fully tried, a motion was prepared for an amended complaint to attack the constitutionality of imposed fluori - dation, and for a permanent injunction, based on danger to public health. The motion was about to be filed when raw power showed itself with lightning speed and impressive clout to limit the political damage. 158 The Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Court of Penn - ________________________________ ________________________ 154. The most critical dispute in the trial was w hether the basic data (set forth in the appendix of this article) should be adjusted for age, race, and sex by the methods proposed by Dr. Dean Burk or Dr. John Yiamouyiannis in National Cancer Program , supra note 109, at 18 -40, 61-72, or by the method pro posed in the Upton Statement, id. at 104 -20, 220 -30. The defense of the Upton Statement collapsed when Dr. David Newell of the RSS conceded that he used data only for 1950 and 1970, and considered nothing in between \"for the main and simple reason\" that h e was sent his data from the NCI. See Aitkenhead v. Borough of West View, No. GD - 4585 -78, Trial Transcript, May 9, 1978, at 72 -72A, 75 -6 (Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, Pa.). Dr. Marvin Schneiderman of NCI admitted that such intermediate data sh ould be used, but could give no specific alternative to linear regression analysis of intercensal CDRs between 1950 and 1970.

Jurisdiction to enter the findings supporting the prelim inary decree of November 16, 1978, was sustained on appeal shortly before Judge Flaherty was elevated to the Supreme Court of Pennsyl - vania. 162 The Commonwealth Court then held that the cause could go no further before the judiciary under the pretext that e xclusive jurisdiction belonged to the administrative agency. 163 That was the end of the case, for all understood the notorious bias of the administrative agency which was not about to admit that it had promoted the dumping of carcinogenic agents into the en vironment. The appellate decisions left the findings of Judge Flaherty un - touched, but departed widely from the traditional rule that, once a court of equity takes jurisdiction over the subject matter of a suit, such jurisdiction continues until the final decree, even though a basis for legal or administrative jurisdiction might later appear. 164 As the USPHS tried to press -release its way out of the crisis in the United States, the findings of Judge Flaherty became highly influen - tial abroad. In the Briti sh House of Lords, the Earl of Yarborough accurately summed up the meaning of the case: Already this evening examples have been quoted of what occurred in America. What I read was rather different from the picture painted this evening.

[Vol. 14:2 there was some legal wrangle about jurisdiction but I thought, on the facts presented by a number of exp erts, that that was the finding and that the facts had not been challenged but merely the jurisdic - tion of the court.165 So important was the meaning of this case that it also attracted the attention of an investigative commission of the Environment Ministry of Quebec, chaired by Dr. Beno\u00eet Bundock who had been the principal medical officer for special projects in the Canadian Ministry of Health. The commission had been diligently studying world literature on fluoridation for over a year when Judge Flaherty returned his findings. They obtained the entire record of the proceedings in Pittsburgh. Dr. Bundock and his colleagues returned a comprehensive report on November 30, 1979, acknowledging the laboratory studies of Dr. Taylor and the basic data of Dr. Burk, specifically concurred with the findings of Judge Flaherty, and recommended executive suspension of all efforts to enforce the mandatory fluoridation law of Quebec. 166 This recommendation was accepted, and the moratorium has now continued almost twenty yea rs through no less than six governments both pequist and liberal. So well regarded is this report that a standard ecology textbook, widely used in the secondary schools of Quebec, forthrightly acknowledges that fluoride in drinking water, as introduced th rough artificial fluoridation of public water supplies, is an environmental pollutant which causes cancer in man. 167 B.

Illinois Pure Water Committee v. Director of Public Health 170 was tried from April t hrough June 1980 before Judge Ronald Niemann. It was a case of uncommon ferocity with endless dilatory motions and preposterous contentions by the State, causing the trial to move at a snail's pace. Judge Niemann endured the experience with almost inhuma n patience. He had a highly skeptical attitude about the testimony offered on behalf of the plaintiffs and he reacted to the large numbers generated by the basic data with astonishment and disbelief. He discounted much of what he heard, but at length was satisfied that the plaintiffs had at least made a prima facie case of danger to public safety. 171 Judge Niemann turned to the State and asked it to account for the association between fluoridation and cancer reflected by the basic data. 172 It should be kept in mind that Chicago is the home of the ADA which has at its command every expert in the world to support fluoridation as a public health measure. Even so, no world class scientists appeared to defend fluoridation as in the hearings before Congress and th e trial in Pittsburgh. 173 A state -hired epidemiologist went so far as to claim that the basic data w ere invalid because the data linking fluoridation with cancer had been selected and organized to meet the requirements of experimental design. In other words, he condemned the comparison of like with like before introducing fluoridation in the experimental cities, then observing the subsequent difference in cancer mortality between the two groups invalidated the data.

The same epidemiologist spoke of the need for adjustments for age, race, and sex, yet th e plaintiffs' case in chief was full of detailed demographic adjustments of the basic data by the direct and indirect methods. 175 A large box of original data, rows of government publi - cations, and a thick bundle of sheets of calculations were brought into the courtroom for inspection. The same epidemiologist made generalized claims that his adjustments wiped away any association between fluoridation and cancer, yet he conspicuously offered no specific figures or documented calculations in support of his projections. 176 \"What causes cancer?\" asked the attorney general of Illinois in his summation, \"Apparently, nobody knows.\" 177 Judge Niemann pondered the case for almost two years. On February 24, 1982, he entered judgment. He thus stated the law: The presumpt ion of the validity of legislation is overcome when the plaintiff makes a prima facie case. The traditional concept of burden of proof resting on the plaintiff, once met, shifts to the government to justify its intrusion into the life and health of the individual. When the State is involved, the traditional view is that the 'King can do no wrong.' Although the King must constantly act for his subjects, certainly he has been wrong a time or two.178 Judge Niemann specifically found, \"[This legislation] expos es the public to the risk, uncertain in its scope, of unhealthy side effects of artificial fluoridation of public water supplies, is unreasonable, and [is] a violation of the due process clause of the Illinois Constitution of 1970.\" 179 He added with disappo intment, \"This record is barren of any credible and reputable scientific epidemiological studies and/or analysis of statistical data which would support the Illinois Legisla - ture's determination that fluoridation of public water supplies is both a safe and effective means of promoting public health.\" 180 ________________________________ ________________________ 174.

Like lightning, the injunction was stayed without any consid - eration of the evidence, as if power, and not public health, were the name of the game. 182 As night follows day, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the circuit court citing broad notions of police power. 183 Particularly offensive about the opinion were numerous petty and vindictive comments made against the plain - tiffs' witnesses, 184 harmful to the dignity of the bench. There was also dissimulation regarding the record, as may be illustrated. Judge Niemann had specifically found that the statute was \"unreasonable,\" and therefore unconstitutional, because a prima facie case had been made that fluoridation exposes the population to a tangible risk, albeit uncertain in extent, of unhealthy side effects, and that no \"credible and reputable\" evidence had been given to justify the intrusion. 185 Yet the Illinois Supreme Court attempted to characterize Judge Niemann's position to be \"not that the risk was so great that flu oridation was unreasonable, but that the question was shown to be debatable. Under these circumstances the plaintiffs have failed to show an unreasonable exercise of the police power.\" 186 C. The Houston Case A third case arose in the Lone Star State, entit led Safe Water Foundation of Texas v. City of Houston .187 The case brought to trial in January 1982, before Judge Anthony Farris.

The findings of Judge Farris, based on a fair preponderance of the evidence, are similar to the findings of Judge Miles Lord in United States v. Reserve Mining Co. , 380 F. Supp 11, 15-17 (D. Minn. 1 974), and United States v. Reserve Mining Co. , 417 F. Supp 789 (D. Minn. 1976), affirmed 543 F. 2d 1210 (8th Cir. 1976). The dumping of taconite tailings was terminated on the principle that, where substantial evidence shows harm to human health, a questi on of public health should be judicially determined by resolving doubt against the introduction of foreign material into environment. 238 J. LAND USE & ENVTL. L. [Vol. 14:2 [That] the artificial fluoridation of public water supplies, such as is contemplated by [Houston] City Ordinance No. 80 -2530 may cause or contribute to the cause of cancer, genet ic damage, intolerant reactions, and chronic toxicity, including dental mottling, in man; that the said artificial fluoridation may aggravate malnutrition and existing illnesses in man; and that the value of said artificial fluoridation is in some doubt as to the reduction of tooth decay in man.204 This assessment of the facts, based on a fair preponderance of the evidence, was a reasonable and impartial picture of scientific reality as it was then understood. If the municipal government of Houston had acted rationally in the face of these findings of fact, effectively a declaratory judgment on the weight of the evidence, the city council would have noted the danger, repealed the ordinance in the public interest, and perhaps established an investigative commi ssion as had occurred in Quebec. But a city councilwoman, smiling broadly as cameras flashed, started the machinery which injected into public drinking water a sub stance judicially found, after an intensive and disciplined trial of the facts, to be carc inogenic and mutagenic. 205 An appeal was taken, b ased mainly on a venerable old case decided by the Texas Supreme Court which held that, where exercise of police power rests on assumed facts, those facts may be judicially examined and, if upon such inquiry i t fairly appears that the means chosen are disproportionate to the end desired, the ordinance should be declared unconstitutional. 206 This principle is typical of the best natural law jurisprudence which prevailed earlier in the twentieth century. Given th e findings of Judge Farris, fluoridation was unconstitutional under this principle, because endangering the public with cancer and other ailments cannot be justified by a dubi - ous possibility of reducing tooth decay. The Texas Court of Appeals expressly f ound that a fair preponderance of the evidence showed \"the injection of fluoride into the City's water system would be harmful,\" 207 but, with the full support of higher tribunals, held that such proof of harm was not enough to arrest an exercise of police power. 208 ________________________________ ________________________ 204.

Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 239 Therefore, it is evident that, at least for the time being, we are saddled with Hugo Black's positivist and anti -libertarian doctrines, and some years must pass before our judiciary sees the need for a change of course. Years must pass as surely as years had to pass from the death of Sir John Elliot following his arrest in 1630 for a speech in Parliament, and the grand day in 1667 when the House of Lords reversed the judgment of the King's Bench which denied Sir John release on a writ of habeas co rpus. 209 Meanwhile, the findings of Judge Flaherty, Judge Niemann, and Judge Farris have since been quoted to legislative bodies from Montreal to Honolulu and from London to Canberra. Not always, but occasionally legislators have listened. There has been o ther interesting political fallout from these judicial findings. On August 9 -10, 1983, a strategic conference of pro - fluoridation activists, most of them deeply involved in ADA and USPHS politics, took place at the University of Michigan. 210 The proceedin gs began with a presentation by a special counsel of the American Dental Association. 211 The gentleman was intro - duced as a member of the rules committee of the Illinois Supreme Court, so it is clear that he was a powerful insider. 212 He told the audience th at it was he who had secured the stay of the injunction from the Illinois Supreme Court issued by Judge Niemann. 213 Counsel did not clearly inform his listeners that, from 1978 through 1982, three American judges in courts of superior jurisdic - tion had fully heard evidence on both sides: the first of these judges, by then a supreme court justice of eminent standing, entered find - ings undisturbed on appeal, saying he was compellingly convinced of the danger of cancer; the second entered findings of no credible or reputable evidence to redeem fluoridation; and the third had entered comprehensive findings based on a preponderance of the evidence, expressly sustained on appeal, condemning fluoridation as posing a tangible danger of cancer and a good many other hum an diseases, while expressing doubt even of its capacity to reduce tooth decay.

Whereas in earlier yea rs it had been standard practice to invite trials, as had occurred in a number of earlier fluoridation cases, a new policy, following the trials in Pittsburgh, Alton, and Houston, was announced: \"By avoiding a trial on the merits of fluoridation, we preven t the subjection of what we feel is a purely scientific issue to scrutiny by a judge who is likely not to have proper scientific training with which to make an objective ruling.\" 214 To recapitulate this interesting phase of legal and scientific history, in the trials in Pittsburgh, Alton, and Houston, one trial judge after another heard the evidence and found that fluorida - tion appears to be injurious to human health. Therefore, the new ADA -USPHS policy is to avoid, by all means, a trial on the merits. This policy has been remarkably successful for over fifteen years. No case has ever gotten to trial. No pro -fluoridation witness has been cross -examined in court. Sales pitches continue before legisla - tive bodies with a fair degree of success in the sense that mandatory or imposed fluoridation has considerably expanded. In legislative committees, witnesses usually cannot be effectively held to account for what they say. We understand that the judicial process is far from perfect. But, now, the \"purely sci entific issue\" mentioned at the University of Michigan -- and fluoridation is a purely scientific issue until legally imposed -- is tried in legislative proceedings by frantic political lobbying, maneuvers, ambushes, speechifying, applause, horse - trading, buttonholing, demagoguery, infighting, and posturing. VIII. T HE COMING END OF FLUORIDATION One of the results of the hearings in Congress on September 21 and October 12, 1977, was a suggestion that the National Toxicology Program (NTP) should investigate fluoride. 215 Over twelve years, the NTP sputtered. At last some news was leaked to the press. On December 28, 1989, the Medical Tribune reported on the front page: Fluoride appears to have caused bone cancer in rodents in a recently completed National Tox icology Program study, and the chemical is now at risk of being classified as a carcinogen, according to internal documents and statements obtained by the Medical Tribune from the Environmental Protection Agency.216 ________________________________ ________________________ 214.

Spring 1999] ARTIFICIAL FLUORIDATION 241 Press fanfare erupted, and the main featur e of this media blitz was the impression that there had been a discovery of something entirely new and previously unknown, as if the work of Alfred Taylor, Dean Burk and many others had never been done. Soon, however, the public was assured that all is we ll.217 The \"official\" evaluation, while leaving much to be desired, gives a very different impression. The authors conceded that, although the numbers were small, the data gathered by the NTP study reveal a statistically significant dose -response trend of o steosarcomas of bone in male rats. 218 Additionally, the authors cited no less than eleven studies published in good journals, showing that fluoride is capable of inducing genetic mutation in mammalian cells and fruit flies, aggravating chromosomal aberratio ns in animal systems, and causing morphological transformations in Syrian hamster ovary cells. 219 The article concludes with the sedate comment that \"it would appear prudent to re -examine previous animal studies and human epidemiological studies, and perform further studies as needed to evaluate more fully any possible association between exposure to fluorides and the occurrence of osteocarcomas of bone.\" 220 We join this recommendation, adding that meanwhile artificial fluoridation of public water supplies oug ht to be halted across the country pending such review of the evidence, as was recommended by Dr. Bundock and his colleagues in Quebec, and that nobody having any direct or indirect interest in the conclusions ought to participate. The recommendation for reevaluation has not b een fulfilled. Ther e are interesting reasons why. On May 1, 1990, the acting Director of the Criteria and Standards Division, Office of Drinking Water in the United States Environ - mental Protection Agency, received a memorandum from Dr. William Marcus, Senior Scientific Advisor in the Criteria and Standards Division. 221 Dr. Marcus reviewed the NTP study and ________________________________ ________________________ 217.

[Vol. 14:2 pointed to results suggesting carcinogenic potential of fluoride. 222 He also cited the most recent published version of the epidem iologi - cal data gathered and adjusted under the direction of Dr. Burk. 223 Dr. Marcus urgently recommended an independent review by the EPA. 224 To put it mildly, Dr. Marcus' memorandum did not inspire a warm and friendly response from the management of the EPA . In due course, Dr. Marcus sent his document to the Administrator of the EPA and to his union representative who in turn released it to the press. The public reaction was rather agitated, causing a bureaucrat from the \"health effects branch\" within the agency to approach Dr. Marcus' supervisor with the suggestion that he memorandum sent \"the wrong message to the public.\" 225 Shortly thereafter, Dr. Marcus was accused of \"violent and aberrant behavior\" and discharged. 226 On December 3, 1992, following extend ed hearings, an admin - istrative law judge found that Dr. Marcus had been fired on false pretexts because of his warnings against artificial fluoridation of public water supplies. 227 The ALJ ordered Dr. Marcus reinstated with back salary, money damages, and attorney's fees, 228 and, on February 7, 1994, the Secretary of Labor affirmed the reinstatement as ordered. The simple and blunt meaning of this episode is impossible to misunderstand. The scientists, lawyers, and engineers at the national headquarters of t he EPA have since used their union for protection against their administrators who, as the case of Dr. Marcus demonstrates, have a political agenda not necessarily in the public interest, and certainly not in the interest of the professionals at EPA who de sire the independence required to act honestly for the general welfare. Under the protection of their union they have made plain that their administrators may set policy, but that they as professionals refuse to conceal the errors of policy set.

NATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM]MEASURING JUSTICE FOR NATURE: ISSUES IN EVALUATING AND LITIGATING NATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES JAMES PECK[*] Copyright \u00a9 1999 Journal of Land Use & Environmental Law I. INTRODUCTION Shortly after midnight on a chilly March 24, 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska. [1] The damaged vessel immediately began gushing crude oil into the Sound, and over the next two days an estimated 11,000,000 gallons of crude oil were discharged into the sensitive marine environment before emergency crews could stop the release. [2] The oil spill spread across Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska, contaminating approximately 1,100 miles of shoreline [3] along Prince William Sound, the Kenai Peninsula, the lower Cook Inlet, the Kodiak Archipelago, and the Alaska Peninsula. [4] Damaged areas included several coastal communities, the Chugash National Forest, four national wildlife refuges, three national parks, five Alaskan State parks, four Alaskan Critical Habitat Areas, and an Alaskan Game Sanctuary. [5] The oil slick killed over 350,000 shore nesting birds [6] and several thousand marine mammals, mostly sea otters, and posed a threat to salmon and herring fisheries in the area. [7] Over the next few years, Exxon spent approximately $2 billion in remediation costs, $5 billion in civil litigation punitive damages, $287 in compensatory damages to commercial fishermen, $20 million in an out-of-court settlement to Alaska natives, and $125 million in criminal fines and restitution payments to state and federal agencies. [8] However, simply cleaning up the spill and compensating injured parties was insufficient to remedy the environmental harms. During the cleanup, an extensive study program was conducted to assess the damage to the natural resources resulting from the disaster above and beyond the damage addressed by the remedial actions. [9] This assessment focused on the immediate injury to the environment, the long-term alteration of species populations, the sublethal or latent effects of the spill, the ecosystem-wide effects, and degradation of habitat. [10] Based on this assessment, Exxon entered into a settle ment agreement with federal and state governments to pay $900 million for the costs of restoring and replacing damaged natural resources. [11] The agreement provided for up to $100 million in additional funding for future restoration if needed. [12] Three federal and three state trustees were designated for administering the restoration funds. [13] All funds were designated to restore, replace, enhance, or acquire the equivalent of natural resources injured, as well as reduced or lost services provided by these resources as a result of the spill. [14] As of the winter of 1997, the trustees had implemented several general restoration projects in damaged areas and acquired approximately 485,000 acres as replacement for damaged resources, mostly for enhancing the recovery of injured wildlife populations through additions to existing wildlife refuges. [15] The natural resources of Prince William Sound have yet to fully recover, and the trust continues to monitor and research the implementation of the restoration program. [16] The Exxon Valdez disaster highlights many of the issues that arise when natural resource damages are included in an assessment of environmental harm. Compared to the costs of investigation or remediation, natural resource damages are not readily accounted for and measured. Therefore, determining suitable methods for measuring the value of natural resources and the extent of recoverable damages are controversial subjects. The purpose of this paper is to discuss what natural resources are for the purpose of defining their value, to outline the methods for valuing damages to natural resources and the services they provide, and to review the legal framework for litigating natural resource damages with a discussion of causes of action under the common law and under federal natural resource protection statutes. The paper concludes with a summary of shortcomings in the current legal framework and provides suggestions for improving the existing system. II. CHARACTERIZATION OF NATURAL RESOURCESNATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM]In any discussion of natural resource damages, it is important to define \"natural resources.\" Natural resources are generally thought of as the individual elements of the natural environment that provide economic and social services to human society. Traditional definitions of natural resources were limited to resources providing quantifiable economic products such as industrial minerals, energy sources, timber, and agricultural land. [17] However, in recent decades there has been a growing recognition that natural resources, as ecosystems, provide a larger array of services to society than merely as a source of industrial raw materials. [18] As these services have come to be recognized, the definition of natural resources has expanded to include ecological elements and the services derived from ecosystem processes. [19] Ecosystem services provided by natural resources that have been investigated since the mid-1960s include the function of wetlands and the effect of watersheds on water quality; the cycling of chemicals and nutrients through ecosystems; and the interaction among natural resources, the atmosphere, and the oceans to regulate climate. [20] A modern list of services provided by natural resources includes the purification of air and water, flood control, detoxification and decomposition of wastes, the formation and maintenance of fertile soils, pollination of crops, control of agricultural pests, and recycling of matter in addition to providing material benefits such as food supplies, industrial products, construction materials, energy sources, and medicines. [21] Additionally, natural resources are part of society's cultural fabric. Throughout American history, the arts, literature, and philosophy have been influenced by the character of the natural landscape. From the diaries of the Lewis and Clark expedition to the writings of Henry David Thoreau, Mark Twain, and the poetry of Walt Whitman, American culture is pervaded by a sense of place in its natural environment, which is reflected in society's value of natural resources. This value is uniquely expressed in the land ethic of Aldo Leopold, which challenged the perspective of natural re sources as simply a commodity, instead emphasizing the moral value of the natural environment of which humanity is a part. [22] Based on such cultural premises, the definition of natural resources has been extended to include an aesthetic element which recognizes that mere existence of the resource has value to people. [23] Such an expansive list of services provided by natural resources creates complexity in defining the extent of these resources in the particular circumstances of natural resource damage litigation. It is one thing to measure the direct loss of economic value of natural resources such as fish or timber, but quite another to measure the resulting negative externalities such as the loss of ecological services or the value of the knowledge of their existence to individuals or to society as a whole. The following section addresses the difficult issue of valuing natural resources for the purpose of litigation damage assessment. III. V ALUATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES One of the most significant aspects of natural resource damage litigation is the assignment of value to the damaged resources. Due to the expansive nature of the definition of natural resources and the difficulty in measuring resource values, the litigated value of damages can vary significantly depending on the philosophical basis of assigning value and the valuation method used. This section outlines the different philosophical bases for valuing natural resources and the methods used in measuring the value of damages to natural resources A. Approaches to the Valuation of Natural Resources It is generally recognized that there are essentially two different philosophical bases of assigning value for natural resources, anthropocentric (or utilitarian) approaches and biocentric (or intrinsic value) approaches. [24] These two approaches are not mutually exclusive, but do assign different values to the same resource under similar circumstances. Anthropocentric approaches can be characterized as utilitarian in that they assign value to natural resources insofar as they provide satisfaction to humans, either individually or as a society. [25] Anthropocentric values can be divided into use values, the worth of natural resources derived from direct or indirect use, and existence values, the worth of natural resources to people beyond their use value. [26] Use values are the least controversial of natural resource values, as they are the easiest to identify and measure as consistent with existing markets. Use value is not limited to consumptive uses, such as timber production, but also includes nonconsumptive uses such as recreation in a resource area, [27] and indirect use values such as the value of plankton in the food chain. [28]NATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM]Anthropocentric values that are not use values are considered existence values. [29] These are the values to individuals and society in simply knowing the natural resources exist. Existence value can be characterized as a vicarious value, which is the value to a particular individual in the knowledge that the natural resource exists, or as an inter-temporal value, which is the value of conserving the resource for future generations. [30] Additionally, existence value contains an element of value related to the option that conservation of the natural resource provides for future use. For example, an endangered plant species may have undiscovered medical uses for which the preservation of the species provides an option value. [31] As a separate category of valuation, the biocentric approach can be generally characterized as a rights-based approach, that recognizes the intrinsic value of natural resource existence independent of human satisfactions. [32] Characteristic of this approach is the philosophy of deep ecology, [33] the animal rights movement, [34] and the land ethic of Aldo Leopold. [35] Intrinsic value is not readily measurable in monetary worth, as intrinsic value is a matter of right. The measure of damages to natural resources under an intrinsic valuation system would necessarily be punitive to serve as a deterrent from violating an intrinsic right. [36] From an economic perspective, the preferred method of valuing natural resources is to quantify anthropocentric values of use and existence through some form of utilitarian cost-benefit analysis. [37] Anthropocentric values are favored because they are theoretically measurable, and the process of measuring damages in a litigation context is by definition anthropocentric. Additionally, intrinsic values are not universally recognized, and the process of monetizing the intrinsic value of an injury to natural resources is speculative. The use of a valuation approach is consistent with current law, which does not recognize legal rights for natural resources apart from the interests that persons or recognized parties have in the resources. [38] The value of a natural resource is the sum of the legally recognized elements of value, insofar as they can be separated and independently measured, but use, existence, and intrinsic value are not necessarily exclusive. [39] Therefore, elements of intrinsic value may be included in measurements of use and existence values of natural resources. To understand which values are included in a measure of natural resource value, it is important to have a basic understanding of the various economic methods used to measure natural resource value. B. Methods of Quantifying the Value of Natural Resources Several methods have been developed over time for measuring the value of natural resource damages. The traditional approach at common law was to measure damages as the market value of the injured natural resources, or where market value was inappropriate or unavailable, the cost to restore or replace the resources. [40] As the concept of natural resources has broadened to include services and nonuse values, natural resource valuation methods have been developed that account for nonmarket values. These methods are generally classified as either direct methods such as contingent valuation (measuring the stated value), or indirect methods such as behavioral use valuation (measuring revealed value). [41] Each of these methods has advantages and shortcomings, as discussed below. 1. Market Valuation Market valuation of natural resources provides a relatively certain measure of resource value, as market value is reflected in the price for resources as traded in a definable market. Under a market valuation approach, the compensable natural resource damages would be the total loss of market value for each of the individually damaged elements and the value of lost services of the natural resource. Use of market valuation is commonly held to be the most economically efficient measure of damages. [42] In theory, market value is the level of compensation to which litigating parties would agree out of court, if no transaction costs were incurred. [43] However, market valuation has limited use in a natural resource damages context. Natural resources often have unique and peculiar values and, in many circumstances, are not openly traded on a free market. Market valuation does not account for the loss of nonmarketed use values such as indirect ecosystem services or for existence or intrinsic nonuse values. Market valuation is generally accepted as not reflective of the true value of damages to natural resources and, in general, will tend to underestimate their true value. [44]NATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM]2. Restoration and Replacement Cost Restoration of a damaged natural resource is an appealing remedy because it directly addresses the harm. Restoration cost is the only valuation method that accounts for the uniqueness of each particular resource and the finite supply of natural resources in general. [45] Additionally, restoration cost incorporates, to some degree, all measures of natural resource value\u2014use, existence, and intrinsic\u2014to provide a full measure of damages. [46] However, restoration cost does not directly measure the value of the damaged resource and can result in costs greatly exceeding the value of the damaged natural resources as measured by other methods. [47] It is generally accepted that a measure of damages that is disproportionate to value is contrary to the policy of promoting economic efficiency. [48] Restoration cost presents technical problems as well. What should be considered baseline conditions, what restoration procedures are appropriate, and what degree of restoration is considered adequate are all questions that need to be addressed.[49] For injuries where extensive habitat destruction or loss of biodiversity has occurred, the restoration of various ecosystem functions may not be possible. [50] Where restoration is not feasible, a similar alternative is to replace the damaged natural resources by acquiring comparable resources for conservation. [51] Replacement value has the advantage of being relatively easy to measure and can provide an effective remedy for the loss of many use and existence values. [52] However, replacement does not address the value of loss for unique resources and does not account for the loss of the combined value that the injured natural resource and its replacement had prior to the injury. [53] 3. Contingent Valuation Contingent valuation is a recently developed method of economic valuation where the value of a natural resource and its services are measured by surveying a sample of the population to provide the price they would be willing to pay to preserve or restore that resource. [54] A variation of contingent valuation is the contingent behavior method, which asks the survey respondents how much they would be willing to modify their behavior patterns to protect or restore a natural resource.[55] Contingent valuation provides a direct method of measuring natural resource values without resorting to the market valuation method. The technique is relatively simple and easy to implement, and provides a direct means of including existence value in a measure of natural resource damages. [56] The survey techniques used in contingent valuation studies also provide a good database of information for indirect methods of valuing natural resources. [57] The use of contingent valuation in natural resource damage estimates has been highly controversial. Critics of the method argue that the method is hypothetical and generates unreliable damage estimates, produces results that cannot be independently validated, determines value from persons lacking sufficient information to be estimating value, and is not consistent with principles of valuation that are basic to the economics profession. [58] These deficiencies in contingent valuation arguably inhibit the method from accurately measuring use and existence values. [59] Most of the concerns regarding contingent valuation are related to the manner in which the survey is designed and implemented. [60] Proponents of contingent valuation have argued that these criticisms are derived from improper design and execution of surveys, and that recent developments in the practice of contingent valuation has increased its use in measuring natural resource damages. [61] Suggested characteristics for obtaining accuracy in contingent valuation surveys include clearly identifying and describing the resource and the impact to be valued, providing a means of establishing that the respondent is familiar with the resource, framing the survey questions so as to avoid implicating political controversies, [62] using yes-no or multiple-choice question format, and to the extent possible avoiding open-ended questions. [63] 4. Behavioral Use Valuation Behavioral use valuation is a broad category of economic methods that can be used to indirectly measure the use value of natural resources by observing differences in behavioral patterns. The change in the behavior of resource users as the result of an injury to natural resources reflects a corresponding reduction in welfare, which is measured under different tests as a proxy to the loss in resource value. [64] One advantage to using behavioral use valuation is that it is less proneNATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM] to error resulting from the individual bias and hypothetical nature of the contingent valuation method. [65] A commonly used behavior use valuation method is the hedonic model, which models the change in value of marketed goods with characteristic attributes that are influenced by an injury to natural resources. [66] The hedonic model typically uses pricing in the housing market as the measured variable to evaluate natural resource damage value, as several studies have indicated that proximity to environmental risks are capitalized in the housing market. [67] However, hedonic modeling has been criticized for being unable to separate the impact to value resulting from natural resource damage from high transaction costs and other characteristics of the location that factor into housing prices. Hedonic modeling is prone to underestimate the value of marginal damage to natural resources, and for many natural resources, there is a limited housing market in the area of the resource from which hedonic valuation could be calculated. [68] Travel cost valuation offers a more appropriate behavioral use valuation method for measuring the value of natural resource damages. Users of natural resources incur travel costs to access the resources, and theoretically the value to the users is reflected in the amount of travel costs they are willing to incur. [69] Travel cost valuation is advantageous because it is relatively easy to obtain reliable data, which may already be available for some natural resource locations. [70] However, similar to hedonic modeling, travel cost valuation is limited to measuring only use values, as nonuse values are not captured in travel expenditures. [71] Additionally, it may not be adequate for measuring the value of small changes in the quality of the natural resource or the amount of knowledge that users have regarding the extent of damage to the resource. [72] It is also difficult to accurately account for opportunity costs resulting from lost wages on the part of the resource users. [73] However in spite of these shortcomings, travel cost valuation is generally regarded as the best available tool for measuring use value where market valuation is inapplicable. [74] This summary of methods available for valuing natural resource damages highlights its complex and controversial nature. The selection of a valuation method is dependent on the values sought to be included, and the particular circumstance in which the damages are to be evaluated. Table 1 summarizes the type of values and their inclusion in different methods of measuring natural resource values. IV. L ITIGATION OVER NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES Natural resource damage litigation can be divided between common law based actions and federal statutory actions. Although there are many similarities between the two types of cases, there are important procedural differences in terms of jurisdiction and standing requirements, as well as differences in the remedies available to plaintiffs. After examining common law legal rights and circumstances under which claims can be made for natural resource damages, this section will explore the federal statutory framework for litigating natural resource damages and the impact these statutes have had on common law actions. A. Common Law Legal Rights over Natural Resources Damages The common law, including statutes enacted under the sovereign powers of the states, are the traditional legal methods for addressing damages to natural resources. The common law provides a framework for addressing interests in natural resources as either public interests or private interests. [75] Public interests are those interests common to the general public, and are vindicated by states acting as sovereign. [76] Private interests are generally private property interests vindicated under principles of tort law. [77] 1. Common Law Public Rights States are recognized as having authority to protect natural resources, insofar as the resources are within the interests of the general public. [78] The most common legal basis for states to have standing to sue for natural resource damages is through an exercise of the police power. In addition to the police power, states can rely on other common law theories recognizing state interests in natural resources. Three additional common-law theories for state based actions are that states: (1) have a proprietary interest in natural resources; (2) are guardians of natural resources under the doctrine of parens patriae; and that (3) are trustees of certain natural resources under the public trust doctrine. [79] a. Police PowerNATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM]The police power provides states the authority to create laws to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general public. [80] The majority of states have enacted statutes authorizing the state fish and wildlife agency or state attorney general to recover damages for environmental harm. [81] State statutes often provide standing to local governments and private parties to recover for natural resource damages as well. [82] Common damages under such statutes are for the full measure of the value of harm, either as the cost of restoration or by a statutorily prescribed unit pricing system. Many states allow for civil and criminal penalties related to the extent of damage. [83] b. Proprietary Interest of States State ownership of wildlife was recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in Geer v. Connecticut ,[84] which held that a state could prohibit the taking of wildlife and transportation for sale outside of state boundaries by virtue of its ownership of wild game. [85] For several decades, Geer provided a framework for states to regulate wildlife based on the states' proprietary interest. However the Court subsequently overruled Geer in Hughes v. Oklahoma,[86] holding that state wildlife protection laws were subject to dormant commerce clause limitations in the manner of other forms of state regulation. [87] The Court in Hughes characterized state ownership of wildlife as a 'legal fiction' merely expressing the importance to a state in preservation and regulation of the exploitation of important resources. [88] This language in Hughes can be interpreted as invalidating the common law doctrine of state ownership of wildlife resources as expressed in Geer. Alternatively, the Hughes decision can be interpreted as applying narrowly to restrictions on interstate commerce. However, subsequent to the Hughes decision, states have justified protection of natural resources on common law doctrines other than the proprietary interest of the state. [89] c. Parens Patriae and Public Nuisance The common law doctrine of parens patriae regards the state as guardian of its citizens who are unable to adequately represent themselves. [90] The doctrine has expanded to allow states to sue to protect articulated quasi-sovereign interests distinct from the interests of particular private parties on behalf of the general public, [91] such as the abatement of public nuisances or the protection of its economy. [92] The right of the state to sue for pollution and natural resource damages on parens patriae grounds is well recognized in the case law. [93] Traditionally parens patriae was used only as a basis for states seeking injunctive relief, but recent court decisions have allowed states to recover money damages in their capacity as parens patriae.[94] The most common cause of state action to protect natural resource damages under the parens patriae is the law of public nuisance. A public nuisance exists where there \"is an unreasonable interfer ence with a right common to the general public.\" [95] Public nuisance originated as a common law group of crimes that have since been replaced by statutory crimes in most jurisdictions. [96] The modern common law action of public nuisance is based on conduct that is more tortious than criminal, and it is no longer necessary that an action be criminal to be a public nuisance. [97] For public nuisance to apply, the nuisance must affect a public interest rather than private individual. It is not the ownership of the resource at issue, but the nature of the injury. [98] The nuisance does not need to affect the entire community, but must substantially interfere with the public right of those who encounter it. [99] Market valuation is typically the standard of measuring money damages in common law nuisance actions for injury to natural resources.[100] d. Public Trust Doctrine Although in general states are no longer held to own natural resources, [101] the public trust doctrine presents a property basis for the legal right of states to natural resource damages. Under the public trust doctrine, states hold title to lands under tidewaters and navigable watercourses in trust for the benefit of the public. [102] The public benefits the state is to protect includes fishing, navigation, commerce, and more recently water quality, wildlife, aesthetic values, public access, and recreational uses. [103] The lands held in trust cannot be alienated by the state except to promote the public interest. [104] In evaluating uses and disposition of the public trust, the states use a balancing test to evaluate the costs and benefits to the trust, protecting the trust interests to the extent possible. [105]NATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM]As the public trust doctrine is limited to navigable river and lake beds, coastal areas, estuaries, and other marine areas, the doctrine will generally not sustain a state action for natural resource damages in dry land areas. [106] However even with this limitation, the doctrine does serve as an important basis for states' interests in natural resources, as many injuries to natural resources are associated with pollution in watercourses and wetland areas. 2. Common Law Private RightsAt common law, private parties and municipal governments are able to sue for natural resource damages under tort doctrines of negligence, nuisance, trespass, or strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities. [107] Each of these causes of action require the private party to have incurred a personal injury distinct from the general public as a result of the tortfeasor's actions and separate from public rights. [108] Recoverable damages typically include lost property interests, economic loss, and potentially punitive damages. Injunctive relief is also often available. [109] a. Negligence Negligence actions are available to private parties and municipalities where the party responsible for an injury to natural resources has failed to exercise an objective standard of due care. [110] To sustain a negligence action one must show that the responsible party was subject to a duty of care, and that the defendant's conduct fell short of that duty resulting in an injury. [111] To establish the responsible party was under a duty of care, a plaintiff must show that the burden to the responsible party in avoiding the injury was outweighed by the probability of an injury and the degree of harm. [112] For natural resource damages, a duty of care will commonly be found because the degree of potential harm to the environment will normally outweigh the burden in avoiding the harm. Establishing that the cause of natural resource damages is the result of the defendant's failure to exercise due care can present a substantial barrier to a negligence action. To recover damages, the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant's conduct caused the injury and that it was not the result of an independent cause. [113] Sophisticated sampling and modeling techniques are often necessary to demonstrate injury and causa tion. [114] However in many negligence actions for natural resource damages, res ipsa loquitur will apply allowing an inference of negligence to be drawn from circumstantial evidence that would not normally be sufficient to present a jury question.[115] In a few jurisdictions res ipsa loquiter shifts the burden to the defendant to come forward with evidence that the cause of injury is not the defendant's negligence. [116] b. Nuisance Nuisance actions by private parties can be either private nuisance or public nuisance causes of action. [117] The two actions are distinguished by the nature of the injury. A private nuisance occurs where there is \"an interference with the use and enjoyment of\" lawfully possessed property. [118] To maintain a private nuisance action, the plaintiff must have a property interest at stake. [119] A person who has \"no interest in the property affected,\" such as a licensee, generally cannot maintain such an action. [120] Remedies available under private nuisance include money damages for lost market value, injunctive relief, and abatement by self-help. [121] Injunctive relief is available under private nuisance if the necessary measures to abate the harm fall short of a complete ban on the activity causing the nuisance. [122] For activities that are highly probable to lead to a nuisance, the activity might be enjoined prior to any resulting damages through a private nuisance action. [123] A public nuisance occurs where there is an interference with a right common to the general public. [124] In addition to the state's right to sue for a public nuisance, private parties may also sue for a public nuisance where they have damages different than those suffered by the general public. [125] For example, in the event of an oil spill, commercial fishermen can recover lost profits because they suffer from damages different in kind than those of the general public. How ever, a local business' profits are not recoverable because the business is only indirectly affected as is the rest of the general public. [126] Remedies available to private parties injured by a public nuisance include money damages, injunctive relief, and abatement. Additionally, members of the general public can seek injunctive relief or abatement of a public nuisance where they have legal standing do to so. [127]NATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM]c. Trespass Private parties have a right of action in trespass where there is a physical invasion of property. [128] Whereas nuisance actions are based on an interference with the right to use and enjoy property, trespass actions are based on an interference with the right to possession. [129] Trespass actions require that the responsible party be more than negligent; the defendant must have intended the action that resulted in the trespass. [130] Once trespass is established, the trespassing party is liable for all consequences. [131] d. Strict Liability Under certain circumstances the tort doctrine of strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities might apply to cases of natural resource damages. To establish a strict liability action, the plaintiff must show that the defendant engaged in an activity that posed a high degree of risk of some harm, that the threatened harm could be serious, and that reasonable care could not have eliminated the risk of harm. [132] Other considerations include the extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage, the inappropriateness of the activity to the location, and the value of the activity to the community. [133] The use of strict liability is not accepted in all jurisdictions, and its application has been limited to activities which are out of place or unnatural for the location in which they are carried out. Examples where the doctrine has been applied include: storage and diversions of large quantities of water; storage of explosives or large quantities of flammable liquids; crop dusting; fumigating with cyanide gas; drilling or refining oil in populated areas; and the emission of noxious gasses in populated areas. [134] The doctrine has not been applied to such activities where the uses are natural to the land, such as utility mains or gas stations. [135] Accidental releases of hazardous substances during storage or transportation are generally not subject to strict liability as an abnormally dangerous activity. [136] B. Federal Natural Resource Protection Statutes Federal environmental legislation over the past 25 years has restructured the law of natural resource damages. [137] Two environmental statutes provide the principle sources of federal authority over natural resource damages: the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) [138] and the Oil Pollution Act (OPA).[139] Although other examples of federal legislation addressing natural resource damages exist, [140] these two statutes are the most generally applicable and provide a consistent framework in which to discuss natural resource damage litigation. 1. Creation of Liability for Natural Resource DamagesCERCLA and OPA both designate liability for all costs of injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources. [141] CERCLA creates liability under circumstances where response costs are incurred in addressing a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. However, for natural resource damage claims, the liability provisions of CERCLA require a proven injury to the resource, and do not allow an action where there is only a threatened release. [142] Parties liable under CERCLA include the current owners and operators of a facility, owners and operators of a facility at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of, persons arranging for transport and disposal of hazardous substances, and transporters of hazardous substances. [143] OPA creates liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters or adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone of deep ocean waters. [144] Parties liable under OPA include the owners, operators or charterers of transport vessels, the owners or operators of onshore facilities, or pipelines, and the lessees of offshore facilities or deep water ports. [145] Public vessels and permitted discharges are excluded from OPA liability. [146] Both CERCLA and OPA establish a strict and joint and several liability scheme for acts that result in damage to natural resources.[147] Liability is limited to injuries to those resources prescribed by statute. The two statutes define natural resources to include \"land, fish, wildlife, biota, air, water, ground water, drinking water supplies, and other such resources belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, appertaining to, or otherwise controlled by the United States. . . , any State or local government or Indian tribe, or any foreign government . . . .\" [148] 2:24:17 PM] are interpreted as being \"otherwise controlled by\" the United States when there is a substantial degree of government regulation present. [149] For purposes of liability, an injury means an observable adverse change in a natural resource that is either directly or indirectly the result of a discharge. [150] Regulations under CERCLA qualify adverse change as a change \"in the chemical or physical quality or the viability of a natural resource.\" [151] OPA regulations include impairment of natural resource services as a component of injury. [152] The statutory liability is only recoverable by the designated trustees, which include the U.S. Government, states, Indian tribes, and foreign governments for natural resources under their respective control. [153] CERCLA authorizes injunctive relief where a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance poses an imminent and substantial threat to public health and welfare or to the environment. The U.S. Attorney General is authorized to secure the injunction, which may include whatever actions are necessary to abate the threat, as determined by the public interest and circumstances of the threat. [154] Authority to determine when such a threat exists has been delegated to the U.S. Coast Guard for releases \"or threatened re lease[s] involving the coastal zone, Great Lakes waters, ports, and harbors.\"[155] Authority for all other releases or threatened releases has been delegated to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. [156] It is significant that unlike recovery for response costs, there must be an established causal link between the responsible party and the injury to the natural resources. [157] Simply satisfying the requirements for a liable party is sufficient to find liability for recovery and response costs. Natural resource damage liability requires that a regulatory definition of causation be satisfied, provided in CERCLA implementing regulations, [158] which can create a burden of proof that presents a substantial technical barrier to recovery. [159] 2. Defenses to Liability for Natural Resource Damages Defenses to OPA and CERCLA are limited to the defenses specified by the statute. Both statutes provide defenses if it can be established that the resulting damages were the result of an act of God, an act of war, or an act or omission of a third party other than an employee/agent of, or a party under a contractual relationship with the, defendant. [160] Both OPA and CERCLA prohibit double recovery for an injury to natural resources. [161] CERCLA prohibits retroactive liability for damages wholly occurring before December 11, 1980. [162] CERCLA also precludes liability where resources have been irretrievably committed in an environmental impact statement where the discharge of hazardous substances is in compliance with an authorized permit. Damages for such a release are still available under existing law, including the common law. [163] Both OPA and CERCLA specify a three year statute of limitations from the date of discovery of the loss of natural resources or the date of promulgation of natural resource damage regulations until an action is brought to recover damages. [164] Total liability under CERCLA is limited to $50 million for natural resource damages. [165] Total liability under OPA is dependent on the type of facility discharging oil. Tank vessels are liable for the greater of $1,200 per gross ton or, either $10 million (for vessels greater than 3,000 gross tons) or $2 million (for vessels less than or equal to 3,000 gross tons).[166] Offshore facilities are liable for up to $75 million [167] while onshore facilities and deepwater ports are liable for up to $350 million. [168] 3. Natural Resources Trustees A significant factor in both OPA and CERCLA provisions is the designation of public trustees to act on behalf of the public interest to recover for natural resource damages. Both OPA and CERCLA designate the President or an authorized representative of any state, Indian tribe, or foreign government to act as a trustee for natural resources. [169] President Reagan designated the Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy to serve as federal trustees, with one of the trustees serving as the Lead Administrative Trustee for each spill resulting in natural resource damages. [170] States are to notify the Environmental Protection Agency of the designated state trustees for natural resources. [171] Under the law of trusts, \"the trustee is under a duty . . . to take reasonable steps to realize on claims which he holds inNATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM] trust.\"[172] The scope of a trustee's authority is limited to the specific terms creating the trust and to any actions \"necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the trust.\" [173] The terms of natural resource trusts under OPA and CERCLA explicitly limit the statutorily available damages for defined injuries. OPA limits natural resource damages to restoration and replacement costs, plus the diminution in value pending restoration or replacement, and the associated assessment costs. [174] CERCLA does not limit damages to restoration and replacement costs, [175] but it requires regulations for assessing the cost of direct and indirect injuries to natural resources that consider at a minimum: replacement value, use value, and the ability of the damaged resource to naturally recover. [176] The assessed value of the natural resource has a rebuttable presumption of validity as provided by the statutes. [177] 4. Natural Resource Damage Assessments The key elements in a statutory based action for natural resource damages are the determination of injury, finding of causation, and measure of compensable damages, all of which are provided in an assessment process authorized under OPA and CERCLA. The regulations for natural resource damage assessments under CERCLA and OPA have developed along separate paths, and have some important differences. a. CERCLA ProceduresNatural resource damage assessment procedures under CERCLA provide a natural resource trustee broad discretion in assessing the value of natural resource damages. CERCLA requires designated federal officials to promulgate regulations for the assessment of natural resource damages. [178] The regulations must provide two procedures: a standard procedure for simple assessments based on the discharge or the affected area, and alternative protocols for more extensive measurements to evaluate the type and extent of short and long term damages, including both direct and indirect damages. [179] The procedure for simple assessments has limited circumstances under which it can be utilized, [180] and is rarely used in CERCLA natural resource damage assessments. [181] The Department of the Interior (DOI) promulgated the first version of damage assessment rules for the more extensive assessments in 1986.[182] The rule required trustees to chose the lesser of restoration or replacement costs or diminution of use values as the measure of natural resource damages, except where restoration or replacement was not technically feasible. [183] In calculating diminution of use values, trustees were to first consider market valuation. [184] If it was determined that market valuation was inappropriate, trustees were to appraise a loss of market value using uniform appraisal standards. [185] If neither market valuation nor appraisal were appropriate measures of value, trustees could use contingent valuation methods, travel cost valuation, or hedonic modeling. [186] Contingent valuation was to be used in estimating non-use values only when use values could not be measured. [187] Upon promulgation the rule was challenged in Ohio v. United States Department of the Interior .[188] States and environmental organizations claimed the assessment process undervalued natural resource damages while industry interests claimed that the rule overvalued natural resource damages. [189] The Circuit Court of the District of Columbia consolidated all actions against the new rule in one suit. [190] The rule was evaluated under the two step test set forth in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resource Defense Council, Inc. [191] to determine whether there was an unambiguous congressional intent, and if not, whether the rule was a reasonable construction of the statute and therefore within the DOI's delegated discretion. [192] The most substantial holding of Ohio was that the 'lesser of' rule, requiring trustees to chose between the lesser of replacement or restoration costs or diminution of use values, violated the intent of congress to give preference to restoration cost as the measure of damages. [193] However, the court did allow for the use of other valuation methods where restoration was infeasible or grossly disproportionate to use value. [194] Additionally, the hierarchy of methods was held to be unreasonable in not accounting for non-use values such as existence and option value, [195] and the rule was remanded to DOI for clarification of the authority of trustees for natural resource damages on lands not owned by the government. [196] The DOI did not appeal the Ohio court's decision and revised the rule accordingly. [197] Under the new rule, natural resource damage assessments occur in three stages: injury determination; quantification; and damage determination. [198] The method for injury determination includes defining the injury, determining the pathway connecting the cause to the injury, and testing and evaluating the natural resource to statistically determine the cause ofNATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM] the injury. [199] During the quantification step, the trustee characterizes the injury in terms of a reduction in natural resource services from a baseline state as well as the time needed for the resources to recover. [200] The damage determination stage was the most significant revision of the rule. The measure of damages established in the new rule is the cost of restoration or replacement of the damaged resource. [201] Additionally, compensable value, the value of the lost services of the resource during the time period from the injury until baseline conditions have been reattained, [202] is available for recovery at the discretion of the trustee. [203] The trustee can chose between several valuation methods for estimating compensable value, including market valuation, appraisal, factor income, travel cost, hedonic pricing, unit value, contingent valuation, or other suitable valuation methods. [204] The use of contingent valuation for measuring option and existence value is available only when the trustee determines there are no relevant use values.[205] b. OPA Procedures OPA is more explicit in natural resource damage assessment procedures, but does provide trustees some discretion in assessing value. Congress passed OPA in 1990 with the Ohio decision in hindsight, and used the Ohio case to draft the natural resource damages provisions of the new statute. [206] OPA expressly mandates the measure of damages as the cost of restoration or replacement, the diminution in value pending restoration, and assessment costs. [207] OPA regulations divide the trustee's responsibilities into a preassessment phase, a restoration planning phase, and a restoration imple mentation phase. [208] During the preassessment phase, the trustee determines whether there has been release of oil to which OPA applies. [209] In the restoration planning phase, the trustee assesses potential injuries to natural resources, quantifies the degree of injury relative to a baseline, and evaluates alternatives for restoration. [210] At a minimum, the trustee must consider a natural recovery alternative and an active restora tion alternative. [211] A unique feature of the restoration planning phase requires trustees to consider compensatory restoration for each alternative. [212] Similar to compensatory value in CERCLA damage assessment rule, compensatory restoration is intended to compensate the public with resource services of similar type and of comparable value to the damaged resources until restoration is complete. [213] The trustee is to evaluate all alternatives based on cost, extent of restoration to be achieved, likelihood of success, extent of preventing future injury, benefits to multiple resources, and the effects on public health and safety. [214] Finally, the trustee is to select and implement the preferred restoration alternative. [215] C. Common Law Actions and Natural Resource Trustees The designation of federal and state agencies as natural resource trustees has radically altered the common law regime for litigation over natural resource damages. Both CERCLA and OPA limit natural resource damage claims to designated trustees, [216] denying standing to local governments and private parties to bring suit for natural resource damages. [217] CERCLA and OPA do not limit states from imposing additional liability requirements or creating addi tional rights of action, [218] and the provisions of CERCLA do not modify obligations or liabilities under any other law, including the common law. [219] Therefore, local governments and private parties have full authority provided to them under state statutes or common law. The prohibition on double recovery for natural resource damages [220] raises the issue of when a designated trustee has preempted the right of action of local governments and private parties. This is a minor issue for parties seeking injunctive relief where the trustee is seeking restoration damages, as the citizen suit provision of CERCLA provides a right of action against the trustee for restoring the resource. [221] However, where replacement is the selected remedy, the preclusion of a claim for injunction is a substantial loss to the local government or private party as the replacement resources are unlikely to be the property of the party seeking injunction. For compensatory value or other use values claimed as damages under CERCLA, the rights of trustees may overlap with the justiciable interests of other parties. Recovery of natural resource damages by the trustees for these uses will preclude recovery by other parties. [222] Where damaged natural resources are located on private property that is under substantial government control, the private property owners may be precluded from recovery for property damage. [223]NATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM] This is not an issue for cases where restoration is the selected alternative once the resources have been restored. However, it is a factor for compensatory value under CERCLA or compensatory restoration under OPA, where damages for use value during restoration are accounted for. [224] Very few natural resource damages claims are fully assessed according to regulatory guidelines. In most cases, the responsible party negotiates a settlement for natural resource damages concurrently with a settlement for cleanup costs.[225] For the purposes of settlement, resource trustees typically use readily available literature and other information to estimate the value of natural resource damages without necessarily following the full assessment procedure in the regulation. [226] The terms of the negotiated settlement typically commit the government to releasing the responsible party from any and all claims for natural resource damages, with preclusive effects for other parties seeking the same natural resource damages. [227] V. C ONCLUSIONS The law of natural resource damages is a complex mix of common law doctrines and statutory rights in an area of law that reflects many different values among parties with different rights in a common cause of action. The law that exists today has developed over years of research and litigation, and presents a reasonable framework for addressing natural resource damages. The advent of federal statutes designating trustees on behalf of the public interest is one of the most significant developments in the law of natural resource damages. By constructing a trust to protect natural resources, federal statutes demonstrate the importance of natural resources to the nation by obligating trustees to recover for damages in the interest of the trust. The recent development of preference for restoration or replacement costs as the presumptive remedy improves the adequacy of the law by including existence values as well as use values in the measure of damages. However, the federal statutory framework does create some problems within the law of natural resource damages. The most significant issue that remains to be resolved is the preclusion of claims of private parties and local governments under common law when natural resource damages have been collected by resource trustees. This is particularly important in situations where damages to private property are precluded on the basis of a natural resource damages judgement or settlement to resource trustees. Affirmatively avoiding preclusion of other parties claims should be developed as a policy of natural resource trustees. OPA and CERCLA damage assessment rules should be modified to include a prescriptive procedure for trustees to determine the potential for precluding other party claims. Such a procedure would best be incorporated into OPA procedures for compensatory restoration or CERCLA procedures for compensatory value, where the possibility of including preclusive damages exists. Another modification that would improve the natural resource damage assessment procedure is to give preference to restoration over replacement. Restoration should be the presumed standard, as it is the only valuation method that is fully inclusive of all measures of value, including intrinsic value. Restoration avoids the net loss of resources that is characteristic in replacement value. Additionally, as a technology-forcing method, restoration encourages the develop ment of technologies for implementing restoration that reduce restoration costs over time. CERCLA regulations provide no preference between restoration and replacement. [228] OPA regulations offer some improvement by including as one of six factors the extent to which the injured natural resources are returned to their natural condition in alternative selection. [229] Both regulations should be modified to include a hierarchy of alternatives with restoration as the preferred alternative unless it is shown to be impracticable. Only in such cases should the trustee consider replacement or other valuation methods in the natural resource damage assessment. These subtle changes to the existing regulations would yield broad improvements in the law of natural resource damages. Parties with actionable rights in natural resources will have assurance that their rights will not be precluded by resource trustees without a credible evaluation of their interests. A more inclusive and comprehensive value of natural resources will be accounted for as trustees would be committed to the restoration of damaged resources, recognizing all values inherent in the resources. With these changes, the coalition of private interests and public trusteesNATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES peck1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:17 PM] will together form a more comprehensive stewardship of the land and provide a truer measure of justice for nature.

BESTFOODS JOHN W. C HAPMAN [*] Copyright \u00a9 1999 Journal of Land Use & Environmental Law I. INTRODUCTION The Industrial Revolution of the 1900's brought great wealth to the United States. However, this great wealth has come largely at the expense of harm to our environment. The dumping of hazardous substances and the creation of waste sites has damaged our environment immensely. In an effort to prevent the creation of hazardous waste sites and to clean up existing hazardous waste sites, the United States has enacted two major statutes. The principal statutory authorities enacted to regulate waste management and prevent the formation of hazardous waste sites are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) [1] and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). [2] Promulgated in 1976, RCRA is responsible for regulating waste management. CERCLA, on the other hand, provides a liability scheme that is designed to prevent the disposal of hazardous substances and provide funding for cleaning up hazardous waste sites. Congress promulgated CERCLA because it believed that RCRA was insufficient to control pollution. Congress determined that a liability scheme designed to hold parties responsible for violations against the environment would aid RCRA in controlling pollution. Under CERCLA's liability scheme it is very important that the plaintiff file suit against potentially responsible parties with the financial capabilities to satisfy a judgment. Otherwise, a plaintiff may get stuck with an unsatisfied judgment. In an effort to hide from liability, many corporations set up subsidiary corporations to own the facilities that present a risk of releasing hazardous substances. Consequently, to reach the assets of the parent corporation the plaintiff must pierce the corporate veil or use some alternative theory of liability to reach the assets of the parent corporation. The issue of parent corporations' liability for the environmental violations of their subsidiary corporations has intensified lately. [3] The intensification of the issue occurred largely as a result of the United States Court of Appeals for Sixth Circuit's opinion in United States v. Cordova Chemical Co. of Michigan .[4] In an en banc decision the Sixth Circuit held that a parent corporation may only be held liable for contamination caused by a subsidiary if the plaintiff can pierce the corporate veil. [5] The Sixth Circuit's decision was celebrated by shareholders and parent corporations that were relying on the traditional limited liability protection of the corporate form. [6] However, a majority of the circuits that have considered this issue have concluded that the parent corporation can be found directly liable without piercing the corporate veil. [7] Thus, the Sixth Circuit placed itself in the clear minority view with its decision in Cordova. Recently, in United States v. Bestfoods, [8] the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Sixth Circuit's opinion in Cordova, directly addressing the issue of parent corporation liability under section 107(a)(2) of CERCLA. This Note analyzes the Supreme Court's decision and discusses whether it provides a meaningful and uniform standard for determining parent corporation liability under CERCLA. Part II of this Note provides a brief explanation of CERCLA and its key provisions. Part III of this Note discusses some of the primary theories used by courts to determine parent corporation liability under CERCLA. Included within Part III is a summary of the Sixth Circuit's opinion in Cordova. Part IV provides a detailed explanation of the facts of Bestfoods along with a summary of the critical parts of the opinions of the district court and the Supreme Court. Part V provides a critical analysis of the Supreme Court's opinion in Bestfoods. In Part V, this Note suggests that the Supreme Court faltered by not addressing the issue of derivative liability under CERCLA, and as a result courts will continue to be inconsistent in determining derivative liability under CERCLA. This Note also advocates adopting a federal common law veil-piercing rule for finding a parent corporation indirectly liable under CERCLA. Finally, Part VI concludes that the Supreme Court properly ruled that a direct liability standard for finding a parent corporation liable exists under CERCLA.UNITED STATES V. BESTFOODS chapman1.htm [7/7/2015 2:22:16 PM]II. C OMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE , COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT In order to gain a full understanding of the ramifications of the Bestfoods decision, a discussion of CERCLA's primary goals and its liability provisions is necessary. A. CERCLA's Primary Goals CERCLA is a comprehensive statute that grants the President of the United States broad power to command government agencies and private parties to clean up hazardous waste sites. [9] CERCLA's two fundamental goals are: (1) to deter the release of hazardous substances into the environment through a liability scheme; and (2) to provide for cleanup if a hazardous substance is released or threatened to be released into the environment. [10] The statute achieves these two goals through two main provisions. First, the statute provides for a federal fund that allows the government to finance the cleanup of a waste site. [11] Second, the statute provides a means for the government or any other party funding a cleanup to recoup cleanup costs from all potentially responsible parties. [12] B. CERCLA's Liability Provisions CERCLA's liability provisions are in section 107 of the statute. [13] Proving liability under CERCLA requires a party to first prove that the defendant is a potentially responsible party (PRP) as defined by the statute. [14] PRPs include: (1) current owners and operators of facilities where hazardous substances are released or threatened to be released; (2) owners or operators of facilities at the time hazardous substances are disposed; (3) persons who arranged for transportation or disposal or treatment of such substances; and (4) persons who accepted such substances for transport to disposal or treatment. [15] Notably, a PRP does not have to cause the environmental harm, nor does the plaintiff have to prove causation. The debate over parent corporation liability under CERCLA stems from the \"owners or operators\" language in section 107. Second, the plaintiff must prove that a release or threatened release of a \"hazardous substance\" from a facility has occurred.[16] Third, the plaintiff must prove that the \"release\" or \"threatened release\" of a \"hazardous substance\" caused the plaintiff to incur response costs. [17] Fourth, if the plaintiff is a private party then the plaintiff must show that its response costs are necessary and consistent with the national contingency plan (NCP). [18] If the plaintiff is the federal or state government, then it must show that it incurred response costs that are not inconsistent with the NCP.[19] Thus, CERCLA allows the government to recoup expenses that are not response costs under the national contingency plan. Finally, if the defendant PRP lacks a defense under CERCLA's provisions, then the plaintiff's CERCLA lawsuit should be successful. [20] III. P ARENT CORPORATIONS' U SE OF THE CORPORATE SHIELD TO ESCAPE CERCLA L IABILITY Because CERCLA does not require the plaintiff to prove causation, [21] the issue of who may be a potentially responsible party becomes very important. In the context of corporations, whether corporations may hide behind the principle of limited liability has become a key issue. Limited liability is a basic principle in the law of corporations. Essentially, the principle holds that shareholders of a corporation may only be liable to the extent of their investment in the corpora tion. [22] For parent corporations that are the sole shareholders of their subsidiary this means that only the subsidiary's assets may be reached. Thus, the parent's other assets are safeguarded from potential loss. However, this principle of corporate law may succumb to the corporate veil-piercing principle that allows a court to find a parent corporation liable for the acts of its subsidiary. [23] Veil-piercing requirements differ amongst the states. Generally, veil-piercing occurs only if the corporate form was misused to commit fraud or some other illegal act. [24] As stated previously, traditionally parent corporations are only held liable if the plaintiff can pierce the parent's corporate veil, essentially holding the parent derivatively liable for the costs of its subsidiary. There is, however, another rationale for finding a parent corporation liable, which is direct liability. [25] Direct liability applies if the parent corporation is deemed an \"operator\" of the facility. [26]UNITED STATES V. BESTFOODS chapman1.htm [7/7/2015 2:22:16 PM]A. Direct Liability The direct liability theory departs from the traditional limited liability principle and allows a court to find a parent liable without piercing the corporate veil. At least two tests have been applied under the direct liability rationale. Some courts apply the actual control test, which extends liability to the parent if the parent exercised actual control over the its subsidiary's activities. [27] Another variation of this test examines whether the parent exercised actual control over the facility in violation of CERCLA. Some courts apply the authority-to-control test, which extends liability to the parent for merely having the authority to control its subsidiary's activities. [28] 1. Examination of Circuit Court Decisions Applying the Actual Control Test At least three federal circuit courts have applied the actual control test when analyzing direct liability under CERCLA. a. First Circuit's Application of the Actual Control Test The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit adopted the actual control test in United States v. Kayser-Roth Corp.[29] In Kayser-Roth, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sued the parent corporation of a dissolved subsidiary to recover the cleanup costs incurred in response to a release of trichloroethylene (TCE). The EPA alleged that the parent was both an \"owner\" and an \"operator\" of the site. [30] The court's analysis began by acknowledging that CERCLA created two categories of potentially liable parties, \"owners\" and \"operators.\" [31] The court determined that Congress did not intend to exclude parent corporations from falling under the definition of \"operators.\" [32] Accordingly, the Kayser-Roth court held that CERCLA, along with its legislative history and purpose, provides no justification for not finding a parent corporation directly liable as an \"operator\" under CERCLA. [33] The First Circuit's test focuses on the parent's actual control over the subsidiary, rather than the parent's ability to control the subsidiary. The First Circuit explained that the district court properly found that the parent exerted practical total influence and control over the subsidiary's operations. [34] The court stated that the parent's control included environmental matters such as the approval of the installation of the cleaning system that used the TCE. [35] The parent had the power to control the release or threat of release of TCE, the power to direct the machinery causing the release, and the ability to limit the damage. [36] Moreover, the parent approved the installation of a scouring system that used TCE and was able to direct the subsidiary on how to handle the TCE. [37] The court held that such control was more than sufficient to meet the actual control test. [38] b. Third Circuit's Application of the Actual Control Test In Lansford-Coaldale Joint Water Authority v. Tonolli Corp. ,[39] the Third Circuit specifically rejected the authority-to- control test, stating that the authority-to-control test \"sweeps too broadly.\" [40] However, the court acknowledged that traditional rules of limited liability for corporations do not apply under CERCLA. [41] Consequently, the court adopted the actual control test, reasoning that the actual control test balances the benefits of limited liability with CERCLA's remedial purposes. [42] The court adopted the First Circuit's test as explained in Kayser-Roth, and as explained by the Western District Court of Michigan in CPC International, Inc. v. Aerojet-General Corp. [43] The court explained that being an \"operator\" under CERCLA requires more than mere ownership. [44] Being an \"operator\" requires \"active involvement in the activities of the subsidiary.\"[45] \"'[M]ere oversight' of the subsidiary or sister corporation's business in a 'manner appropriate and consistent with the investment relationship' does not ordinarily result in operator liability, a corporation's 'actual participation and control' over the other corporation's decision-making does.\" [46] The court explained that determining whether the parent exercised sufficient control is a fact-intensive inquiry. [47] The inquiry involves considering the totality of the circumstances, while focusing on the parent's involvement in the subsidiary's day-to-day operations and policy-making decisions. [48] The court explained that since the test is concerned with control rather than ownership, a corpora tion can be held liable as the \"operator\" of its sister corporation. [49] In United States v. USX Corp. ,[50] the Third Circuit followed its ruling in Lansford-Coaldale. The court stated that itUNITED STATES V. 2:22:16 PM] recognized that were separate and distinct con cepts. [51] Accordingly, the court ruled that traditional corporate veil-piercing principles applied to cases where a plaintiff asserts that a parent is liable as an \"owner.\"[52] However, where a plaintiff asserts that a parent corporation is liable as an \"operator\" then veil-piercing is not required. [53] c. Eleventh Circuit's Application of the Actual Control Test In Jacksonville Electric Authority v. Bernuth Corp. ,[54] the Eleventh Circuit followed the Kayser-Roth court's ruling that merely owning stock of a corporation that disposes of hazardous waste is insufficient to find the shareholder liable as an \"operator\" of the corporation's facility. [55] The court reasoned that being an operator of a corporation's facility requires more than complete ownership and the ability to control the facility that comes with complete ownership. [56] The court ruled that to be directly liable as an \"operator\" the parent must actually supervise the activities of the facility .[57] Notably, the Eleventh Circuit focused on the parent corporation's supervision over the facility rather than the subsidiary corporation. [58] The Eleventh Circuit stated that most courts that have been concerned with the meaning of \"operator liability\" have held shareholders responsible when the shareholder (1) \"actually participated in the operations of the facility . . . [o]r in the activities which resulted in disposal\" or (2) \"actually exercised control over, or was otherwise intimately involved in the operations of, the corporation immediately responsible for the operation of the facility.\" [59] The Eleventh Circuit agreed with the reasoning of these cases. [60] The Eleventh Circuit did not find any evidence in Bernuth that demonstrated that the parent was actively involved in the facility's occupational business affairs, or that the parent itself actually partici pated in the contamination. [61] Thus, the court affirmed the district court's judgment that the parent corporation was not liable. [62] d. Criticisms of the Actual Control Test At least one commentator has criticized the actual control test because it allows some entities that are related to the hazardous releases to escape liability. [63] Thus, this commentator complains that the standard is contrary to CERCLA's goal of broadly placing liability on those responsible for the substance's release. [64] The idea behind the goal is that CERCLA should place more cost on the entity so that the entity is encouraged to take more precautionary measures. Commentators argue that the actual control approach does not adequately address issues of fairness along with public health and safety. [65] One commentator notes, for example, that the test fails to consider the benefits the parent corporation receives from the illegal acts of its subsidiary. [66] This same commentator argues that if a parent benefits from its subsidiary's prohibited activity, then it ought to help cover clean-up costs in the interest of public health and safety.[67] The same commentator also disagrees with the actual control test because it allows a parent that has been involved in the subsidiary's activities to escape liability if it has not been in actual control of the activities that led to the pollution. [68] 2. Examination of Circuit Court Decisions Applying the Authority-to-Control Test As explained previously, under the authority-to-control test a parent corporation may be held liable for the acts of its subsidiary merely for having the authority to control the activities of its subsidiary. [69] The Fourth Circuit has adopted this approach. [70] The Ninth Circuit has indicated in dicta that it favors this approach. [71] a. Fourth Circuit's Application of the Authority-to-Control Test. In Nurad, Inc. v. William E. Hooper & Sons Co. ,[72] the Fourth Circuit ruled that authority to control the facility, not actual control, is the standard for liability under CERCLA. [73] The court stated that the authority-to-control standard is proper because it holds a party liable if that party has the authority to undertake efforts to abate damage, but the party fails to exercise that authority. [74] The Nurad court erroneously stated that most of the courts applied the authority-to-control standard to the term \"operator.\"[75] For support, the Nurad court inadequately cited two district court opinions. [76]The Nurad court then stated that under the authority-to-control standard, a court is entitled to consider a defendant's actual conduct asUNITED STATES V. BESTFOODS chapman1.htm [7/7/2015 2:22:16 PM] evidence of the authority to control. [77] b. Criticisms of the Authority-to-Control Test Commentators criticize this approach for being too broad. [78] One commentator argues that a literal application of the standard would make liability inescapable for a parent corporation in every case where the parent's subsidiary is accused of a CERCLA violation. [79] Most courts have refused to apply the standard because it essentially obliterates the well-established principle that limits shareholder liability to the shareholder's investment. [80] These courts reason that if the parent or a main shareholder exercises normal activity regarding its subsidiary, then the parent should not be held liable. [81] 3. Second Circuit's Adoption of a Direct Liability Standard In Schiavone v. Pearce ,[82] the Second Circuit attempted to draw a definite distinction between direct liability and derivative liability under CERCLA. The Second Circuit attempted to reconcile direct liability and derivative liability based on veil-piercing through an examination of CERCLA's goals and its unique statutory scheme. [83] First, the court noted that CERCLA was designed to be remedial; thus it deserved a liberal interpretation. [84] Applying a liberal interpretation to CERCLA, the court concluded that imposing operator liability directly on parent corporations whose own acts violate CERCLA is consistent with the purpose of CERCLA. [85] The court then cited cases where courts held parent corporations independently liable, as operators, for the activities of their subsidiaries. [86] The court stated that the courts reasoned that finding operator liability in such cases was consistent with CERCLA's expansive goals despite the inconsistency with the traditional rules of corporate liability. [87] The court also cited cases where a subsidiary and its parent were respectively found independently liable as \"owner\" and \"operator\" for environmental harms caused by the same activities. [88] Again, the court stated that CERCLA's goals were to provide a liability scheme that departs from traditional corporate law limited liability principles. [89] Despite the Second Circuit's references to CERCLA's goals as justification for finding a parent corporation directly liable, the Second Circuit stated that the most compelling argument for imposing direct liability on a parent corporation stems from the language of the statute. [90] The court highlighted Congress' use of \"owner\" and \"operator\" in section 107(a)(2) as denoting two different liability concepts. [91] The court proceeded to explain that the distinction between \"owner\" and \"operator\" has particular relevance in the context of parent and subsidiary corporations. [92] The court cited the Third Circuit, which explained: Under CERCLA, a corporation may be held liable as an owner for the actions of its subsidiary corporation in situations in which it is determined that piercing the corporate veil is warranted . . . . Operator liability, in contrast, is generally reserved for those situations in which a parent or sister corporation is deemed, due to the specifics of its relationship with its affiliated corporation, to have had substantial control over the facility in question. [93] Significantly, in a critical footnote the Schiavone court refused to rule on what degree of control was necessary to find the parent directly liable as an operator. [94] The court noted that the circuits were split on whether to apply the actual control standard or the authority-to-control standard. [95] B. Derivative Liability A minority of courts strictly abides by the traditional notion of finding a parent corporation liable only if veil-piercing is warranted. These courts refuse to adopt a direct liability standard under CERCLA, because they refuse to part from traditional corporate liability principles. Two options exist under the derivative liability rationale. [96] Some courts hold that state corporate veil-piercing laws should be applied to actions under CERCLA. [97] Other courts hold that a federal common law rule of veil-piercing should be applied under CERCLA in order to produce a uniform system of derivative liability under the federal statute. [98] The conflict of whether to apply state veil-piercing law or to adopt a federal standard for veil-piercing under CERCLA has created a lack of uniformity in CERCLA's application. Adding to the confusion, the courts applying a federalUNITED STATES V. BESTFOODS chapman1.htm [7/7/2015 2:22:16 PM] common law rule of veil-piercing have not settled on one standard federal common law rule. [99] Consequently, this creates forum-shopping opportunities and prevents a consistent liability scheme from emerging under CERCLA. [100] 1. Fifth Circuit In Joslyn Manufacturing Co. v. T.L. James & Co. ,[101] the Fifth Circuit specifically refused to extend liability under CERCLA beyond the traditional concepts of corporate law. [102] The Joslyn court reasoned that CERCLA failed to define \"owners\" or \"operators\" as including the parent company of offending wholly owned subsidiaries. [103] Also, the Joslyn court reasoned that the legislative history of CERCLA failed to indicate that Congress intended to alter a basic tenet of corporate law by allowing for direct liability. [104] In Riverside Market Development Corp. v. International Building Products, Inc. ,[105] the Fifth Circuit held that a majority shareholder of a corporation that owns an asbestos manufacturing plant is not an \"owner\" under CERCLA's liability provisions. [106] The court stated that the property of the corporation belongs to the corporation not the shareholders.[107] The Fifth Circuit then turned to the question of whether a majority shareholder can be considered an \"operator\" under CERCLA. The court first explained that it was not surprised that CERCLA failed to define \"operator,\" because CERCLA was drafted hastily, \"and passed through a lame-duck Congressional session . . . .\" [108] The court then stated that it could conceive of situations where an \"individual director, officer or employee of a corporation may be considered an 'operator' of a manufacturing facility as defined by CERCLA . . . .\" [109] The court explained that under traditional notions of corporate limited liability shareholders, officers, and employees would not be held responsible for acts of a valid corporation. [110] However, the court stated in dicta that CERCLA prevented individuals from hiding behind the corporate shield when they act as \"operators\" by actually participating in the conduct prohibited by the Act. [111] This statement is contrary to the Fifth Circuit's ruling in Joslyn, which occurred nearly one and a half years earlier. Thus, this indicates a change in the Fifth Circuit's view that corporate liability under CERCLA should strictly follow traditional notions of corporate liability. IV. U NITED STATES V. BESTFOODS In United States v. Bestfoods [112] the Supreme Court reviewed the Sixth Circuit's opinion in United States v. Cordova Chemical Co. of Michigan ,[113] dealing directly with the issue of what determines parent corporation liability under CERCLA. A. Facts of Bestfoods In 1957, Ott Chemical Co. (Ott I) began manufacturing chemicals at a plant in Michigan. [114] Its unintentional and intentional dumping of hazardous substances caused significant pollution to the soil and ground water at the site. [115] In 1965, CPC International (CPC) [116] incorporated a subsidiary to buy Ott I's assets in exchange for CPC stock. [117] CPC was the sole owner of the newly formed subsidiary. [118] CPC kept the name Ott Chemical Co. (Ott II) for the subsidiary, and continued manufacturing chemicals at the site and polluting the site and its surround ings. [119] CPC also kept the managers of Ott I and made them officers of Ott II. [120] Significantly, CPC kept the founder, president, and principal shareholder of Ott I, Arnold Ott, on board as an officer of Ott II. [121] Arnold Ott and several other officers of Ott II were also given positions at CPC. [122] Thus, these people performed duties for both CPC and Ott II. In 1972, CPC sold Ott II to Story Chemical Company (Story). [123] Story operated the Ott II plant until it entered bankruptcy in 1977. [124] Soon after Story's bankruptcy, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) inspected the Ott II plant site for environmental damage. [125] MDNR found that the land was littered with thousands of leaking and exploding drums of waste. [126] MDNR also found that the soil and water was saturated with noxious chemicals. [127] Soon after discovering the waste, MDNR began looking for a buyer for the property that would be willing to invest in the property's cleanup. [128] MDNR found Aerojet-General Corporation and arranged bankruptcy trustee. [129] Rather than acquire the property in its own name, Aerojet created a wholly owned California subsidiary, Cordova Chemical Company (Cordova/California) to purchase the property. [130] Cordova/California then created a wholly owned Michigan subsidiary, Cordova Chemical Company of Michigan (Cordova/Michigan) to run the facility. [131] Cordova/Michigan manufactured chemicals at the former Ott II site until 1986.[132] In 1981, the EPA decided to oversee the site's cleanup. [133] The cleanup plan estimated expenses far into the tens of millions of dollars. [134] To recover some of the money spent on the cleanup the United States filed suit against CPC, Aerojet, Cordova/California, Cordova/Michigan, and Arnold Ott. [135] The suit was filed under section 107(a)(2) of CERCLA, which authorizes suits against, among others, \"any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility.\" [136] The district court separated the trial into three phases: (1) liability; (2) remedy; and (3) insurance coverage. [137] As of the date of the Supreme Court's opinion, only the liability phase had been completed. [138] The parties stipulated that the plant was a facility within the meaning of section 101(9), that hazardous substances were released at the facility, and that the United States incurred response costs to clean up the site that were reimbursable under CERCLA. [139] Thus, the trial centered on the issue of whether CPC, as the parent corporation of Ott II, and Aerojet, as the parent corporation of the Cordova companies, had \"owned or operated\" Ott II's plant within the meaning of section 107(a)(2).[140] B. The District Court's Opinion The district court ruled that liability of the parent corporation might exist in two ways. [141] First, the parent corporation may be directly liable under the \"operator\" language of CERCLA's section 107(a)(2). [142] The court reasoned that under this language CERCLA liability could attach to a parent corporation that acts in a manner that constitutes operation of a facility despite never owning the site. The court stated that Congress's addition of \"operated . . . unmistakably expanded the reach of CERCLA beyond the limited realm of those who have 'owned' sites.\" [143] Second, the parent corporation may be held liable through common law veil-piercing, \"which may arise in any liability case involving a corporate defendant.\" [144] Thus, the district court's opinion was consistent with the opinions of the majority of the circuits, which expanded corporate liability under CERCLA beyond traditional notions of corporate liability. The district court reasoned, in its ruling on direct liability, that CERCLA's \"owned or operated\" language created a \"new, middle ground\" for corporate liability that \"accommodates the general principle of limited liability and the broader principle of liability attaching for operative activity.\" [145] Accordingly, the court ruled that direct liability of a parent corporation is not found merely because a parent had involvement with its subsidiary through their investment relationship. Rather, the court ruled that the parent must actually \"operate\" the business of its subsidiary. [146] The court applied the direct liability criteria to CPC and Aerojet and held both liable. [147] In regards to CPC, the court explained that CPC selected Ott II's board of directors and filled its executive offices with CPC's officials. [148] Further, another CPC official played a key role in developing Ott II's environmental compliance policy. [149] The court did not reach the issue of determining whether the parents' actions were sufficient to pierce the corporate veil, because liability was already found under the direct liability approach. [150] However, the court stated that it would apply state veil-piercing laws if it were necessary. [151] C. The Sixth Circuit's Opinion The Sixth Circuit provided a majority opinion as well as a concurring opinion by Judge Merritt which provides a more in-depth analysis. 1. Majority OpinionIn United States v. Cordova Chemical Co. of Michigan [152] the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeal recognized that a parent corporation may be held directly liable under section 107(a)(2) if it actually operates its subsidiary's facility, or if theUNITED STATES V. BESTFOODS chapman1.htm [7/7/2015 2:22:16 PM] parent acts as a joint venturer with the subsidiary. [153] However, the Sixth Circuit refused to extend direct liability to the parent's actions concerning its subsidiary. [154] The Sixth Circuit explained that parent corporation liability for operating a facility that is held out to be operated by its subsidiary depends on two factors. [155] First, parent corporation liability depends upon the degree to which the parent controls the subsidiary. [156] Second, parent corporation liability depends upon the degree and form of its involvement with the facility. [157] These two factors must rise to a level that warrants piercing the corporate veil and disregarding the two separate corporate entities. [158] The Sixth Circuit's view was that traditional notions of corporate law must be strictly followed even when finding a parent corporation directly liable. Hence, the Sixth Circuit considered direct and derivative liability as a single inquiry. The Sixth Circuit held that determining whether piercing the veil was warranted required application of Michigan law.[159] Applying Michigan veil-piercing law, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the parent corporations were not liable for controlling their subsidiaries' actions, because the parents and their subsidiaries maintained separate personalities and the parents never used their subsidiaries' corporate form to commit fraud or subvert justice. [160] 2. Judge Merritt's Opinion Judge Merritt concurred with the portion of the district court's opinion that held CPC International directly liable as an \"operator.\"[161] However, Judge Merritt disagreed with the majority's application of Michigan veil-piercing law. [162] Judge Merritt opined that federal common law should govern whether the parents should be held liable as current \"owners.\" [163] Judge Merritt was the only judge in the en banc hearing to address the choice of law issue. However, other judges have attempted to demonstrate why federal rules should be used for veil-piercing over state rules. [164] Judge Merritt stated that the law is well-established that federal law governs actions arising under nationwide federal programs.[165] Judge Merritt explained that in United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc. ,[166] the Supreme Court enumerated factors that a court must consider in deciding whether to apply state law or federal common law to federal programs. The Kimbell Foods Court explained that federal programs that \"by their nature\" need to be uniform in application throughout the nation necessitate formulation of controlling federal rules. [167] However, if little need exists for uniform application of the law nationwide, then state law may be used as the federal rule of decision. [168] Along with uniformity, courts must also consider whether applying state law would frustrate specific objectives of the federal program.[169] Also, courts must consider whether application of a uniform federal rule would disrupt commercial relationships founded on state law. [170] Applying the Kimbell Foods test, Judge Merritt determined that all three of the Kimbell Foods factors supported using a uniform federal rule for veil-piercing under CERCLA. In attempting to eliminate the dangers of hazardous wastes, CERCLA presents a national solution to a nationwide problem. One can hardly imagine a federal program more demanding of national uniformity than environmental protection. Congress did not intend that the ability of the executive to fund the clean up of hazardous waste sites should depend on the attitudes of the several states toward parent-subsidiary liability in general, or CERCLA in particular. The need for a uniform federal rule is especially great for questions of piercing the corporate veil, since liability under the statute must not depend on the particular state in which a defendant happens to reside. [171] Judge Merritt argued that allowing state law to control in this area would allow corporations to evade CERCLA by incorporating their subsidiaries in states with tougher veil-piercing re quirements. [172] In addition, Judge Merritt argued that states do not have as strong an interest in regulating shareholder liability to outside parties as they do in regulating the internal affairs of a corporation. [173] Although few of the circuit courts have considered the choice of law issue, [174] Judge Merritt argues that the weight of federal precedent supports a federal common law standard for piercing the corporate veil. [175] Judge Merritt then continued his opinion by advocating a federal standard for veil-piercing under CERCLA. [176] He states that two elements are generally regarded as essential to piercing the corporate veil: \"First, the dominantUNITED STATES V. BESTFOODS corporation must have controlled the subservient corporation, and second, the dominant corporation must have proximately caused [the] plaintiff harm through misuse of this control.\" [177] Judge Merritt acknowledged that some cases require an element of fraud for piercing the corporate veil. [178] However, Judge Merritt determined that fraud should not be required in cases under CERCLA. [179] He explained that the public policy considerations underlying CERCLA provide a sufficient equitable basis for piercing the corporate veil whether or not fraud is shown.[180] Judge Merritt also dismissed the proximate cause element, because Congress provided statutory liability criteria for CERCLA.[181] Thus, if a CERCLA defendant is determined to be a potentially responsible party under section 107, then no finding of proximate cause is required. Judge Merritt then explained that the federal common law test for piercing the corporate veil under CERCLA should be whether the parent corporation \"controls or at the relevant time controlled the management and operations of the subsidiary.\"[182] Federal courts applying the above standard have utilized either a twelve-factor test [183] or a seven- factor test. [184] Judge Merritt explained that these tests overlap, and neither lists all the factors that should be considered. [185] Rather than advocate either of these two tests, Judge Merritt advocated a test that looks at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the parent controls or controlled the management and operations of the subsidiary.[186] If the trier of fact determines that the parent controlled the management and operations of its subsidiary, then the veil would be pierced and the parent would be found liable. D. The Supreme Court's Opinion The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the circuits over the extent to which parent corporations may be held liable under CERCLA for environmental violations concerning their subsidiaries. [187] The Supreme Court split its opinion into a section addressing derivative liability and a section addressing direct liability. 1. Supreme Court's Opinion on Derivative Liability Under CERCLAJustice Souter, writing for a unanimous Court, began the analysis with an explanation of general rules of corporate liability accompanied by an explanation of general corporate veil-piercing require ments. [188] The Court explained that CERCLA failed to specifically speak to the liability implications of corporate liability. [189] Accordingly, the Court refused to abrogate state law regarding corporate liability. [190] Thus, the Court ruled that the Sixth Circuit correctly applied state law in holding that derivative liability may only exist if the plaintiff can pierce the corporate veil. [191] The Court acknowledged that the circuits were split on whether to apply applicable state veil-piercing law or to apply a federal common law of veil-piercing. [192] However, in a critical footnote the Court explained that the case did not raise this issue, stating that none of the parties challenged the Sixth Circuit's holding that CPC and Aerojet incurred no derivative liability. [193] In footnote ten, the Court hid an additional important piece of information. The Court stated that some courts and commentators have suggested that the indirect, veil-piercing approach can only subject a parent corporation to liability as an \"owner,\" and not as an \"operator.\"[194] However, the Court disagreed with this. [195] The Court stated that in cases where a subsidiary \"operates,\" but does not \"own\" a facility, the parent may be held derivatively liable for the subsidiary's acts as the \"operator.\" [196] This finding requires that the parent pervasively control the subsidiary for a sufficiently improper purpose to justify veil-piercing. [197] Again, the Court fails to address the issue of what rules of veil-piercing should apply. [198] 2. Supreme Court's Opinion on Direct Liability Under CERCLA The Court then addressed the issue of finding a parent company directly liable for its own actions in operating a facility owned by its subsidiary.[199] The Court explained that nothing in CERCLA's terms bar a parent corporation from direct liability. [200] Under CERCLA's plain language any person who \"operates\" a facility may be directly liable for the costs of cleaning up the pollution. [201] The Court stated that this extends to \"the owner's parent corporation or business partner, or even a saboteur who sneaks into the facility at night to discharge its poisons out of malice.\" [202]UNITED STATES V. BESTFOODS chapman1.htm [7/7/2015 2:22:16 PM] Significantly, the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship is of no relevance in cases where the operation of the facility is done on behalf of the parent corporation. [203] Thus, there is no veil-piercing requirement to find a parent corporation directly liable. [204] In defining actions that deserve finding the parent corporation directly liable, the Court analyzed CERCLA's definition of a facility's \"operator.\" [205] The Court determined that for purposes of CERCLA's concern with environmental contamination, \"an operator must manage, direct, or conduct operations specifically related to pollution, that is, operations having to do with the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste, or decisions about compliance with environmental regulations.\" [206] The Court overruled the Sixth Circuit's analysis of direct liability, because the Sixth Circuit combined direct and derivative liability. [207] The Court explained that the Sixth Circuit's test asks about the relationship between the parent and the subsidiary corporation, rather than asking about the parent corporation's interaction with the subsidiary's facility. [208] To keep direct and derivative liability distinct, the Court stated that the focus of the derivative and direct liability tests must be different. [209] Under the direct liability test, the focus should not be whether the parent corporation \"operates\" the subsidiary. [210] Rather, the focus should be whether the parent corporation \"operates\" the facility, which is evidenced by the parent corporation's \"participation in the activities of the facility.\" [211] Thus, the Court stated that the district court's analysis should have rested on the relationship between CPC and the facility in question, rather than solely on CPC's relationship with its subsidiary, Ott II. [212] The Court also stated that the district court erred by not recognizing that merely serving as a director of a parent corporation and its subsidiary simultaneously is insufficient to subject the parent to liability for the acts of the subsidiary.[213] This was an error by the district court because the common law rule states that parents and subsidiaries may have dual office holders without attributing the acts of the subsidiary to the parent. [214] If the mere evidence of common corporate personnel acting at management or direction levels would support a finding of a parent corporation's direct liability, then piercing the corporate veil to find a parent indirectly liable would become \"academic.\" [215] Upholding the district court's ruling would create \"a relaxed, CERCLA-specific rule of derivative liability that would banish traditional standards and expectations from the law of CERCLA liability.\" [216] The Court based its refusal to apply this rule on Congress' failure to address it in CERCLA. [217] Accordingly, the Court agreed with the Sixth Circuit's ruling that a participation-and-control test, examining the parent's supervision over its subsidiary and assuming that dual office holders always act for the parent, cannot be used to identify direct parental liability. [218] However, the Court opined that the Sixth Circuit erred by confining its examples of direct parental operation to exclusive or joint ven tures. [219] The Court stated that the Sixth Circuit erred by not considering the possibility of direct operation by CPC in this case. [220] The Court proceeded to explain that Congress's use of the verb \"to operate\" means more than just mechanically activating pumps and valves. [221] Rather, Congress intended operation to include the \"exercise of direction over the facility's activities.\" [222] The Sixth Circuit recognized this for two situations. [223] First, a parent may be directly liable if the parent operates the facility in place of the subsidiary. [224] Second, a parent may be directly liable if the parent operates the facility alongside the subsidiary in a type of joint venture. [225] The Supreme Court upheld the Sixth Circuit's ruling that direct liability should extend to these cases. However, the Supreme Court extended the Sixth Circuit's reasoning to include a situation where a dual officer or director departs \"so far from the norms of parental influence exercised through dual office-holding as to serve the parent, even when ostensibly acting on behalf of the subsidiary in operating the facility.\" [226] The Court also extended it to cases where a parent's agent directs activities at the facility when the agent has no responsibility to the subsidiary.[227] The Court then engaged in a line-drawing analysis to separate acts that stem from the normal parent-subsidiary relationship from acts of direct operation that give rise to parent liability. [228] The Court stated that the critical question that must be answered to determine if a parent corporation should be held directly liable is \"whether, in degree and detail, actions directed to the facility by an agent of the parent alone are eccentric under accepted norms of parentalUNITED STATES V. BESTFOODS The Court specifically excepted parent corporations from direct liability for engaging in: [A]ctivities that involve the facility but which are consistent with the parent's investor status, such as monitoring of the subsidiary's performance, supervision of the subsidiary's finance and capital budget decisions, and articulation of general policies and procedures, should not give rise to direct liability. [230] In the instant case, the Court determined that the district court's opinion indicated that evidence existed that supported finding CPC directly liable. [231] The Court mentioned the fact that an agent of CPC played a role in dealing with the toxic risks that emanated from the plant. [232] The agent was not an employee of CPC's subsidiary Ott II; thus his actions were on behalf of CPC. [233] The Court quoted language from the district court's opinion, stating that the agent \"actively participated in and exerted control over a variety of Ott II environmental matters,\" and the agent \"issued directives regarding Ott II's responses to regulatory inquiries.\" [234] The Court refused to specifically rule that the evidence was enough to find CPC directly liable. [235] However, the Court stated that the findings were significant enough to raise an issue of CPC's operation of the facility through the agent's actions. [236] Conse quently, the Court vacated the Sixth Circuit's opinion and remanded the case to the district court for a reevaluation of the agent's role and the role of any other CPC agent who may have played a part in operating the Muskegon facility. [237] V. A NALYSIS OF SUPREME COURT'S O PINION The Supreme Court correctly broke down its analysis of parent corporation liability into the areas of derivative or indirect liability and direct liability. This is a correct analysis because CERCLA does not rest liability entirely on the ownership of the polluting facility. If CERCLA's liability provisions only provided for liability to the \"owner\" of the facility, then traditional corporate veil-piercing principles would be the only means to find a parent liable under CERCLA. However, the statute's language states, and its purpose suggests, that CERCLA was intended to expand parent liability beyond traditional notions of corporate liability. This is evidenced by the term \"operator\" which coexists disjunctively with \"owner\" in CERCLA's liability provisions. The majority of the circuits agree with this position, and the Supreme Court correctly followed suit by splitting its decision into separate analyses of derivative liability and direct liability. A. Supreme Court's Derivative Liability Standard The Supreme Court implicitly upheld the Sixth Circuit's use of Michigan's veil-piercing laws for determining derivative liability under CERCLA. [238] The Court apparently based this ruling on its refusal to abrogate state corporation law, stating that state corporation law should not be ignored just because a federal statute is involved. The Court stated that \"the failure of the statute to speak to a matter as fundamental as the liability implications of corporate ownership demands application of the rule that '[i]n order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must speak directly to the question addressed by the common law.'\" [239] The Court acknowledged the split amongst the circuit courts on whether to apply state veil-piercing law or whether to apply a federal common law rule of veil-piercing. [240] However, in a critical footnote the Court refused to rule on this issue.[241] The Court's refusal to abrogate state corporation law based on CERCLA's failure to specifically speak to parent corporation liability indicates that the Court would probably rule that courts should apply the appropriate state veil-piercing law. [242] However, ruling that state veil-piercing law should apply under CERCLA would be a mistake. Making such a rule would allow parent corporations to forum shop by choosing to incorporate and locate their subsidiaries in states where veil-piercing laws are more stringent. Thus, proving parent corporation liability under CERCLA by piercing the corporate veil would become more difficult. Clearly, this is not the type of application that Congress envisioned when it enacted CERCLA. Moreover, this application would be contrary to CERCLA's underlying policy, which is to place liability on all potentially responsible parties.UNITED STATES V. BESTFOODS chapman1.htm [7/7/2015 2:22:16 PM]Despite Congress's failure to specifically abrogate state corporation law, a federal rule of veil-piercing should be applied in cases under CERCLA. The Supreme Court should have adopted the federal common law test for veil-piercing that is advocated by Judge Merritt in his concurring opinion in United States v. Cordova Chemical Co. of Michigan .[243] As explained, supra Part II.B.2.b, Judge Merritt's test requires that the trier of fact examine the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the parent controlled the management and operations of the subsidiary. If the trier of fact determines that the parent exerted control, then the corporate veil should be pierced and the parent should be found liable. Consistent with CERCLA's relaxed liability policy of finding all potentially responsible parties liable, this test does not require that the plaintiff prove that the parent corporation proximately caused the violation. CERCLA provides for strict liability. Also consistent with CERCLA's liability policy, the test does not require that the plaintiff show that the parent corporation's conduct was fraudulent. According to dicta in the Supreme Court's opinion in Bestfoods, this test should not only be applied to cases where a parent's subsidiary owns and operates a facility that violates CERCLA. Courts should also apply this test to pierce the corporate veil in cases where the subsidiary operates the facility, but does not own the facility. Evidence of Congress's intent for federal common law to supplement CERCLA exists. During the debates on CERCLA Representative Florio stated, \"[t]o insure the development of a uniform rule of law, and to discourage business[es] dealing in hazardous substances from locating primarily in states with more lenient laws, the bill will encourage the further development of a Federal common law.\" [244] Also, prior Supreme Court rulings support adopting a federal common law rule for veil-piercing in cases under CERCLA. First, as explained in Judge Merritt's concurring opinion in Cordova, the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc. [245] supports the adoption of a federal common law rule. [246] Another justification for promulgating a federal rule of veil-piercing under CERCLA is the Supreme Court's ruling in Boyle v. United Technologies, Corp. [247] According to Boyle , federal common law principles should control where: (1) a unique federal interest is presented, and (2) significant conflict exists between a federal interest and state law.[248] Consistent with the requirements in Boyle , this situation presents a unique federal interest. First, a unique federal interest exists because CERCLA is a federal statute and should be applied as uniformly as possible. CERCLA is the primary means for funding the cleanup of hazardous waste sites. If the Court continues to allow CERCLA's liability provisions to be manipulated by all the federal courts to provide an inconsistent liability scheme, then CERCLA will be evaded by corporations taking advantage of relaxed rules in certain states. Second, determining whether a parent corporation is a potentially responsible party is key for a plaintiff to recover under CERCLA. This issue could determine whether the Superfund is reimbursed for a significant amount of money. Clearly, this is of interest to all United States taxpayers. Third, as explained above, Congress's intent that a federal common law assist in providing a uniform application of CERCLA is apparent in CERCLA's legislative history. Also consistent with the Supreme Court's requirements, significant conflict exists between federal policy and state law. Currently, federal courts are split on whether to apply state veil-piercing principles or a federal common law rule of veil-piercing. The courts that apply a federal common law rule of veil-piercing are even split on what factors should make up the federal common law rule. This only serves to increase the inconsistencies in determining parent corporation liability under CERCLA. Thus, one federal rule for veil-piercing should be adopted and applied for cases arising under CERCLA. B. Supreme Court's Direct Liability Standard Since Congress failed to define \"operate\" within CERCLA, the Court appropriately provided definition to the word. The Court's definition essentially extends \"operate\" to any decision-making concerning environmental matters of a hazardous \"facility.\" [249]UNITED STATES V. BESTFOODS chapman1.htm [7/7/2015 2:22:16 PM]The Court properly ruled that parent corporations, as well as anyone else, should be included as operators if they act in a manner that falls within the Court's definition of \"operate.\" This analysis was correct because CERCLA failed to specifically exclude parent corporations, or anyone else, from being classified as an operator. Also, and more importantly, CERCLA's policy of extending liability to all potentially responsible parties is upheld and bolstered by the Supreme Court's decision to include parent corporations under the term \"operate.\" Moreover, a majority of the United States appellate courts have ruled that parent corporations should fall under the definition of \"operate\" if their acts constitute operation of the facility. Significantly, the Court ruled that direct liability should focus on whether the parent \"operated\" the facility, rather than whether the parent \"operated\" the subsidiary. This is significant because, by demanding that the analysis of operation focus on the facility, the Court allows derivative liability alone to provide for liability where a parent controls the operation of its subsidiary. Notably, the circuit courts were inconsistent in their opinions on direct liability. While some referred to a parent operating its subsidiary when analyzing direct liability, [250] other circuits referred to the parent operating the specific facility that violated CERCLA. [251] The Supreme Court's analysis was correct on this issue for two reasons. First, focusing on the parent's control of the facility allows traditional limited liability concepts to function independently of the direct liability standard that is prescribed by CERCLA. Second, the statute's liability provisions state that the issue of operation should focus on the operator of the facility. [252] The Supreme Court's ruling that a parent can be derivatively liable for a subsidiary's mere operation of a facility is not inconsistent with the statute, because it follows traditional veil-piercing principles. To illustrate how the Court's opinion provides clarification, imagine a situation where a parent's subsidiary corporation owns other businesses besides a facility that has released hazardous waste. The parent may control the subsidiary's operation concerning its other businesses, but allow the subsidiary to run the facility. While this may be a situation that warrants piercing the corporate veil, it is clearly not a situation where the parent should be found directly liable. Contrary to the decisions of the circuit courts regarding direct liability, the Supreme Court refused to adopt either the actual control standard or the authority-to-control standard. Rather, the Supreme Court adopted a standard that examines specific situations where a parent corporation's conduct rises to a level that warrants finding the parent corporation directly liable as an operator. Each of the situations described by the Court do not require an analysis of whether the parent controlled the subsidiary, as does the derivative liability standard. Two of the situations merely ask a court to examine if the parent was either running the facility independently or participating in a joint venture with its subsidiary to run the facility. The Court does not list specific factors to examine when determining if the above two situations are met. However, determining whether a parent is running a facility is an easy inquiry. This determination just requires an examination of who is making the decisions concerning the facility. Determining whether a joint venture is taking place can be a more difficult inquiry. However, if the facts come close to suggesting a joint venture, then a court should find the parent and the subsidiary directly liable. The third situation the Court describes is when the actions of an agent of the parent alone directed toward its subsidiary's facility are eccentric with respect to the normal parent-subsidiary relationship. The Court specifically excepted actions that deal with the parent's investor status. However, the Court clarified actions by a parent's agent that could be considered actions that rise to the level that warrants finding the parent directly liable as an \"operator.\" These actions include any act by an agent to participate in, or control decisions concerning environmental matters for the subsidiary's facility. The Court's extension of the scope of a parent corporation's direct liability under CERCLA to acts concerning a parent's agent is also consistent with CERCLA's policy of holding all potentially responsible parties liable. In such cases, the Court appropriately excludes financial oversight by a parent's agent, because finance is an area where a parent should always provide oversight. However, once a parent's agent acts in a manner which directly affects decisions concerning environmental matters that ultimately subject the facility to CERCLA violations, then the parent should be exposed to direct liability under CERCLA's \"operator\" provision. This standard appropriately prevents a parent corporation from escaping liability for acts of an agent, for which the corporation should be found V. BESTFOODS chapman1.htm [7/7/2015 2:22:16 PM]The Court's standard for finding direct liability strikes an appropriate balance between the actual control and the authority-to-control standards. The standard does not violate the main criticism of the authority-to-control standard, which is that parents should not be held liable for exercising normal activity toward its subsidiary. Also, the standard does not make liability inescapable for a parent corporation in every case where its subsidiary is accused of violating CERCLA. The standard does not violate the main criticism of the actual control test, which is that the standard is contrary to CERCLA's goal of placing liability on those responsible for the substance's release. Rather, the standard allows a parent to be held liable in the cases where a parent should be held directly liable, which is in cases where the parent takes an active role in making environmental decisions concerning the facility violating CERCLA. VI. C ONCLUSION Clearly, the Court should have taken the opportunity in Bestfoods to adopt a federal common law rule of veil-piercing for cases under CERCLA. Such a rule, coupled with the Supreme Court's ruling regarding direct liability, would assist in providing a uniform and meaningful standard for determining parent corporation liability under CERCLA. However, if the Court continues to refuse to address this issue then Congress should amend CERCLA to provide clear criteria for determining parent corporation liability under CERCLA. _______________________________ [*] J.D.

NATIONAL MINING LIMITS SECTION 404 CONTROL OF CONSTRUCTION IN WETLANDS MICHAEL HOLLINS [*] Copyright \u00a9 1999 Journal of Land Use & Environmental Law I. INTRODUCTION The recent decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in National Mining Association v. United States Army Corps of Engineers[1] cannot encourage those who look to the courts to protect wetlands. [2] National Mining held that the Tulloch Rule, [3] which embodied the hopes of environmentalists that all wetland construction could be regulated, was invalid on its face. This holding leaves little doubt that the main federal statute governing wetlands, section 404 [4] of the Clean Water Act (CWA), [5] cannot fully control their development. Section 404, as the CWA provision which regulates the disposal of dredged and fill material, was the authority for the Tulloch Rule. The rule arose out of opposition to a large North Carolina residential project, built during the late 1980's on a type of wetland with particu lar environmental value. [6] This development raised the question whether section 404 covers small redeposits of soil caused by excavation using machines like backhoes, dredges, and bulldozers. These redeposits, termed \"incidental fallback,\" are the result of minor spillage from the bucket of the machine. [7] The fallback occurs as excavated material falls back onto the wetland near the place where it was removed. The redeposits have no purpose but are simply incidental to the activity with which they are associated. Before the Tulloch Rule, regulation of wetlands under section 404 did not reach construction which produced only de minimis amounts of incidental fallback. [8] This section covers the deposit of material in wetlands, but not its mere removal by excavation. Developers like the one responsible for the North Carolina project had successfully used a strategy which exploited this gap. By digging ditches, channels, or retention ponds and taking care that almost none of the excavated material was redeposited, they could drain the wetland parts of a site without a federal permit. [9] This exacting process paid off by making further construction much easier, not only in terms of engineering, but also under the law. Once drained, the land could be developed using ordinary methods. [10] In this way, large areas of wetland were converted into development projects without the need for a section 404 permit. The purpose of the Tulloch Rule was to close off this means of avoiding section 404 regulation. [11] Environmental groups had long been concerned by what they considered the habitual reluctance of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\") to protect wetlands ag gressively. [12] One of these groups sued the Corps in North Carolina Wildlife Federation v. Tulloch .[13] This suit challenged the Corps' authority to issue a permit for the North Carolina project. The Corps and the EPA, co-administrators of section 404 from the beginning, [14] decided to settle the suit by agreeing to regulations to prevent similar development. They adopted the Tulloch Rule in 1993 as a result of this settlement agreement. [15] The effect of the Tulloch Rule was to require a permit for almost all mechanized landclearing and excavation of the type needed to develop wetland sites. [16] The rule achieved this result by extending Section 404 to reach \"any addition, including any redeposit\" of material, even in de minimis amounts. [17] The existence of an \"addition\" is a necessary condition for section 404 jurisdiction. [18] If the addition comes from a \"point source,\" [19] consists of a \"pollutant,\" [20] and takes place in a \"water of the United States,\" [21] it is also a \"discharge\" [22] within the meaning of the CWA. This article has three main parts. Because the statutory authority for the Tulloch Rule is the central issue in National Mining, Part Two reviews the basic features of the CWA and the context in which it operates. Part Three considers the most significant arguments for the Tulloch Rule presented in the case and analyzes the reasoning the court followed in rejecting them. Part Four analyzes how the Tulloch Rule operated, in order to explain how its purpose and design contributed to making it invalid. A conclusion follows. II. T HE ROLE OF SECTION 404 OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT OF 1972NATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION hollins1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:02 PM]A. Legislative History Responding to a growing public demand for greater environmental protection, Congress in 1972 extensively amended the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [23] to create a comprehensive program to control water pollution. The objective of this amended statute, now commonly termed the Clean Water Act, [24] was \"to restore and main tain the chemical, biological, and physical integrity of the Nation's waters.\" [25] As the central means to achieve this objective, the CWA established a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). [26] The recently-created EPA was to administer the NPDES, with authority to control the discharge of pollutants from point sources into U.S. waters. [27] Congress was hesitant, however, to subject the huge volumes of material [28] dredged from major shipping channels to the NPDES.[29] Some members argued that overly exacting regulation of dredged material, especially if administered by the EPA with its limited resources, might interfere with the country's commerce. [30] Some were also concerned that EPA's regulation under the NPDES would infringe the Corps' existing regulation under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (RHA).[31] Responding to these concerns, Congress created section 404 as an exception to the NPDES.[32] It hoped to make open-water disposal of dredged material as environmentally benign as possible without unduly disrupting the country's commerce [33] until some better method could be found. [34] This section accomplished this goal by confining disposal to certain locations. [35] This compromise also resulted in dual administration of section 404. The Corps, with its longtime experience in dredging, was to take the lead in issuing permits for the disposal of dredged material. [36] The EPA was ostensibly to support this effort by issuing guidelines for disposal. [37] However, its inclusion also reflected the concern of some in Congress that the Corps' environmental stewardship should be monitored. [38] B. Permit Criteria The chief provisions of section 404 divide permit authority between the Corps and the EPA. Subsection 404(a) authorizes the Corps, consulting with the EPA, to issue permits specifying disposal sites \"for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters.\" [39] Where an activity causes a discharge of this material and thus invokes section 404, the Corps uses a public interest test to decide whether to issue a permit. Under this test, the Corps considers the public need for the proposed activity as well as the appli cant's need for it. [40] It also estimates how strong and how permanent the activity's positive and negative effects are likely to be. [41] In par ticular, the Corps determines whether there are practical alternatives to the proposal. [42] If these exist, are in other respects environmentally benign, and would damage the aquatic environment less, it must ordinarily deny the permit. [43] When it considers whether alternatives are available, the Corps looks to the time when the applicant first entered the market for land for the proposed project. [44] The Corps must determine whether a permit for a proposed activity is in the public interest according to the guidelines EPA adopts.[45] Subsection 404(a) requires the Corps' permitting authority to comply with the provisions of subsection 404(b).[46] Section 404(b)(1) directs the EPA, together with the Corps, to develop guidelines for designating disposal sites.[47] The EPA must base these guidelines on criteria similar to those which CWA section 403(c) applies to ocean discharges.[48] C. Basis for Jurisdiction The agencies' jurisdiction under the CWA derives from Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. [49] Although the CWA defines jurisdiction under section 404 broadly as the \"waters of the United States,\" [50] it does not directly address wetlands. The agencies at first interpreted their physical jurisdiction narrowly, [51] but court decisions expanded it. In 1974, several federal courts [52] construed federal jurisdiction to extend landward from the usual boundary between waters which are literally navigable and wetlands.[53] Under this construction, the agencies' section 404 jurisdiction reached waters which are not navigable by traditional standards. The Corps, however, for some time declined to change its regulations to reflect these decisions.[54] This resistance of broader jurisdiction gave rise to a citizen suit in National Resources Defense Council v. Callaway. [55] Callaway required the Corps to publish regulations applying section 404 to \"the waters of the United States,\" even if not literally navigable. By invalidating regulations which had effectively placed about one-half theNATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION hollins1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:02 PM] country's wetlands outside the agencies' jurisdiction, [56] this decision greatly enlarged the area which the Corps must regulate. [57] By 1985, when the Supreme Court decided United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes ,[58] the Corps was not resisting broader jurisdiction in the regulation at issue in that case. This regulation included wetlands which, although adjacent to navigable waterways, had no overt hydrologic connection to them. Noting that Congress meant the CWA to achieve the fullest possible protection of U.S. waters, the Court held that section 404 could reach land which was not flooded or permeated by water from an adjacent navigable body. [59] Riverside Bayview Homes establishes beyond doubt that section 404 covers wetlands as well as waters which are literally navigable. [60] D. The Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act of 1899 A conflict between section 404 of the CWA and the RHA [61] over dredging provides another important background issue in National Mining. When it assigned the disposal of dredged material to section 404, Congress nevertheless left control over dredging itself under the RHA. [62] The RHA governs dredging activities but does not reach wetlands; the CWA governs wetlands but does not reach dredging activities. [63] The National Mining court held that the Tulloch Rule was an unauthorized attempt to govern dredging activities in wetlands, in effect using the CWA's authority to import the lacking jurisdiction from the RHA. [64] Therefore, although the RHA was not directly at issue in National Mining, a full understanding of the case calls for some consideration of it. In the RHA, Congress authorized the Corps to protect the navigability of the country's waterways. [65] Two sections of the RHA have been especially important in this effort. Section 10 authorizes the Corps to regulate structures and \"work\" which might affect navigation. [66] A major part of this work, much of which is done on a very large scale, consists of dredging in areas of heavy ship traffic. [67] The Corps either commissions this dredging or performs it itself. Section 13, commonly termed the \"Refuse Act,\" reduces the hazard to shipping from waterborne debris by requiring a permit to deposit most refuse into navigable waters. [68] During the RHA's first sixty years, courts viewed the Corps' responsibilities under the Act in terms of navigation only.[69] The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA), however, as amended in 1970, [70] obligated federal agencies to determine in advance the effects of their projects on fish and wildlife. [71] This development seemed to require the Corps to assess these effects before issuing a dredge and fill permit under section 10 of the RHA. An important decision of the Fifth Circuit in Zabel v. Tabb[72] upheld the Corps' authority to deny these permits solely on environmental grounds. [73] As late as the 1960's, the Corps continued to regard the purpose of section 13 as assuring safe and efficient navigation. [74] Federal prosecutors, however, began about 1960 to use section 13 successfully against industrial water polluters. [75] Its success in this newer environmental application persuaded President Nixon to make the Refuse Act the basis of a more general program. He set this out in a 1970 executive order which directed the Corps to use permits to control water pollution. [76] Before long, however, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated this plan by ruling that section 13 provided no statutory authority for the program. [77] This result both limited the environmental role of the RHA [78] and made clear that a national campaign against water pollution must rest on a firmer legal foundation. The CWA became this foundation. [79] III. T HE HOLDING IN NATIONAL MINING A. Incidental Fallback and the \"Addition\" Problem At least after publishing new regulations in 1986, the Corps had avoided the overextension of the CWA which was fatal to the Tulloch Rule by exempting de minimis amounts of incidental fallback from section 404 coverage. [80] By assuring that CWA regulation of a discharge did not directly reach the activity which generated it, this exemption prevented infringement on RHA jurisdiction. [81] The agencies' acknowledgment that excavation without incidental fallback was practically impossible [82] made a de minimis exemption all the more necessary. Without it, the Corps would be openly admitting that in practice, it was reaching an act of excavation every time it regulated the fallback incidental to that act under section 404. [83] If the RHA alone governs acts of excavation, however, the CWA could not authorize any regulation so extensive. [84] The development challenged in Tulloch converted about 700 acres of a unique type of coastal wetland called pocosinNATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION hollins1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:02 PM] into housing.[85] It furnished a harsh demonstration that the Corps' policy against regulating incidental fallback hindered its ability to prevent the loss of environmentally valuable wetlands. The landowner had been careful to consult with the Corps' district office at every stage of the project, and each time it could find no grounds for requiring a section 404 permit. [86] However disconcerting to environmental groups the Corps' acquiescence was, it was consistent with the agencies' position that Congress did not intend the CWA to govern excavation activities. In the Tulloch settlement, however, the Corps agreed to propose a rule whose validity rested on just that interpretation. [87] In the District Court for the District of Columbia, opponents of the Tulloch Rule brought a facial challenge that it was inconsistent with the language and intent of the CWA and therefore exceeded the Corps' section 404 jurisdiction. [88] In National Mining , the plaintiffs' main claim was that the Corps' interpretation of incidental fallback as an \"addition\" violated the unambiguous terms of the CWA. [89] The Corps in return offered its main counterargument, [90] which relied on two undisputed facts. The first was that the CWA defines \"dredged material\" as wetland soil, sediment, debris, or other material excavated from United States waters. [91] The second was that the CWA includes \"dredged spoil,\" as well as rock, sand, and \"cellar dirt,\" in its definition of \"pollutant.\" [92] The argument concluded from these definitions that dredged material undergoes a legal metamorphosis into a pollutant at the moment of excavation. [93] Therefore, the redeposit of part of this material as incidental fallback is the addition of a pollutant from a point source to a water of the United States\u2014a discharge. As a discharge, the Corps argued, the fallback was regulable under section 404. The court rejected this argument, holding that incidental fallback resulting from a net withdrawal of dredged material cannot reasonably be considered an addition. [94] Therefore it is irrelevant whether any legal metamorphosis into a pollutant takes place. [95] No addition of a pollutant material can occur when there simply is no addition of material. [96] The court seemed to give great weight to the large proportion of removed to redeposited material which characterizes incidental fallback. In a statement that went to the heart of the decision, it said that \"Congress could not have contemplated that the attempted removal of 100 tons of [dredged spoil] could constitute an addition simply because only 99 tons of it were actually taken away.\" [97] The court then emphasized that the RHA governs the removal of material from United States waters. [98] It concluded that the agencies could not reach this activity simply by declaring in a CWA regulation that incomplete removal constitutes addition. [99] In coming to its decision, the District of Columbia Circuit had to resolve the underlying question of how to define an \"addition.\"[100] The National Wildlife Federation, which defended the rule, argued that to interpret \"addition\" as the plaintiffs urged would read regula tion of dredged material out of Section 404. [101] The court agreed that, because dredged material comes from United States waters, [102] this would indeed be the result of requiring that a pollutant come from outside a wetland to constitute an \"addition.\" [103] It also acknowledged that the discharge of dredged material back into a water could broadly be construed as a \"redeposit.\" [104] Nevertheless, the court said, it was not holding the Corps could not regulate some redeposits under section 404. [105] Rather, it was holding only that the Tulloch Rule's assertion of jurisdiction over incidental fallback exceeded the Corps' statutory authority. [106] The court observed that, because the CWA draws no \"bright line\" between a regulable redeposit and incidental fallback, a to differentiate the two \"would merit considerable deference.\" [107] However, it found that the purpose of the Tulloch Rule was to expand the Corps' authority to include a range of activities which \"cannot remotely be said to 'add' anything\" to U.S. waters. [108] Judge Silberman's concurring opinion raised several interesting issues. He began by explaining the standard of review the court had implicitly used in characterizing the Tulloch Rule's interpretation of incidental fallback as \"unreasonable.\" He believed the court had concluded that neither section 404's plain language nor its legislative history revealed Congress' precise intent on this question, and that it was therefore evaluating the rule under Step II of the Chevron test.[109] This second step of the Chevron test makes reasonableness the criterion by which courts assess the validity of administrative agencies' statutory interpretations. [110] Judge Silberman reiterated the majority's view that to apply the word \"addition\" to dredged material connotes that it was either moved some distance away and then dropped, or held for some time before being dropped back in the same place. [111] He then identified two ways in which the Tulloch Rule failed as a reasonable interpretation of the meaning Congress intended for an \"addition\" under the CWA. First, because incidental fallback is inevitable in dredging, the Tulloch Rule's treatment of it as an \"addition\" converts all dredging into the discharge of dredged material. [112] A comparison of the CWA with the RHA, however, indicates that it is not reasonable to do this. [113] Second, Section 404 authorizes the Corps to issue permits for discharges atNATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION hollins1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:02 PM] \"specified disposal sites.\" [114] This construction suggests that Congress meant for the material to be discharged at some distance from the place where the dredging occurred, and after some time. [115] This meaning, however, simply does not fit incidental fallback, which is immediate and occurs close to the point of dredging. [116] Judge Silberman observed finally that the Corps tried to avoid these problems with its \"metamorphosis\" argument, in which he found a logical problem. The argument construed the CWA to make incidental fallback a discharge, because the excavated material became a pollutant when it was dredged and an addition when redeposited. [117] The concurring opinion noted that this argument begs the question of what constitutes a \"discharge,\" because rock and sand only become \"pollutants\" under the CWA once they are \"discharged into water.\" [118] Under the \"metamorphosis\" argument for the Tulloch Rule, however, incidental fallback of rock or sand becomes a \"discharge\" only because that material had already become a pollutant before its addition to the water. B. Incidental Fallback in Case Law The Corps also attempted to defend the Tulloch Rule by relying on case law. National Mining addresses several of these cases decided before the rule was published. The case law argument drew in part on the Fifth Circuit's statement in Avoyelles Sportsmen's League, Inc. v. Marsh [119] that \"the word 'addition,' as used in the definition of the term 'discharge,' may reasonably be understood to include 'redeposit.'\" [120] The National Mining court, however, found that this statement did not address incidental fallback. [121] Avoyelles concerned the displacement of large amounts of soil during the conversion of a wetland site to soybean fields. In this construction, trees were uprooted, pushed into windrows together with the soil they dragged along, and set afire. The partly burned material was then either buried or disked into the soil. [122] The basis for the Avoyelles decision was the court's finding that a discharge of fill material [123] had occurred. [124] The argument from case law also cited United States v. MCC of Florida, [125] but the National Mining court questioned the decision's relevance to incidental fallback. [126] In MCC, a construction firm used a tugboat to transport building materials to a site. The boat made many passages through a shallow channel in the course of this work, and its propeller wash excavated bottom sediment and cast it to the side. This sediment settled onto and gradually destroyed adjacent beds of sea grass. The Eleventh Circuit held that this deposit was a regulable discharge of dredged spoil. [127] As in Avoyelles, however, both the amount of the material redistributed and its direct effect were far greater than what occurs with incidental fallback. The deposit was sufficient to smother plants that had, until then, been able to survive all naturally-induced shifting of bottom sediments. The National Mining court observed that the redeposit in MCC was in any event less analogous to incidental fallback than to sidecasting. [128] Sidecasting usually occurs during trenching, as the excavating machine deposits a row of dirt alongside the trench and a few feet to the side of it. [129] This material is then easily collected and hauled away. The District of Columbia Circuit stated that Rybachek v. EPA [130] may have been the strongest case supporting the Tulloch Rule. [131] The defendants in Rybachek , while conducting placer mining, had excavated soil and gravel from a streambed in order to extract gold. After this was done, they discharged the leftover material back into the water. The Ninth Circuit held that the material discharged was a pollutant, and that to the extent it originally came from the streambed, its \"resuspension\" could be interpreted as the addition of a pollutant under the CWA. [132] The National Mining court observed that if the Ninth Circuit had held instead that extraction of the gold accompanied by incidental fallback was the addition of a pollutant, Rybachek would have helped the agencies. [133] However, the Rybachek court regarded the reinjection of the processed material as a discrete act which took place, not in the course of extracting the gold, but after it had been completed. [134] IV. H OW THE TULLOCH RULE DEVELOPED A. The de Minimis Exemption of Incidental Fallback This section will explain how the Tulloch Rule altered previous regulation to extend jurisdiction under section 404. The rule had the difficult task of extending section 404 to excavation activities on wetlands while purporting to regulate only their discharges. [135] The solution to this problem of statutory jurisdiction relied primarily on recasting the de minimis exemption of incidental fallback. The Tulloch Rule preserved this exemption in form while making it nearly impossible to achieve in fact. [136] The de minimis exemption remained useful to the agencies, if not to applicants,NATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION hollins1.htm [7/7/2015 2:24:02 PM] because its asserted that incidental fallback was not regulable in every case. Its preservation therefore allowed the agencies a colorable claim that the rule did not categorically regulate wetland excavation. In the commentary accompanying the Tulloch Rule, the agencies also observed that the de minimis exemption for fallback relieved them of the need to make a finding of fact that there could be no excavation without a discharge. [137] However remote the possibility of an excavation activity which would produce no fallback, they did not have to find that such an activity was literally impossible. The agencies stated that excavation without incidental fallback was \"virtually impossible,\" [138] but now they asserted that some advanced excavation technique might conceivably produce discharges so small as to be exempt. [139] However, the Tulloch Rule offered no means by which a proponent of any sort of construction might reasonably estimate whether its incidental discharges would be regulable. Two characteristics in particular of the Tulloch Rule's de minimis exemption tended to reduce it to an artifice. First, although the previous basis for such exemption of a discharge had been its physical magnitude, [140] the rule now cast the exemption in terms of environmental effect. [141] The Tulloch Rule reached any discharge that the agencies had concluded would \"degrade\" any quality of the affected water. [142] While not quantifying the magnitude of this threshold, the agencies emphasized that it would be \"very low.\" [143] Second, the Tulloch Rule placed on the proponent of an activity the burden of demonstrating that its incidental discharges would have only \"inconsequential\" adverse effects.[144] B. The Section 404 \"Recapture Clause\" and Regulation by Effect The agencies found another method for achieving the Tulloch Rule's purpose in an unlikely place: a subsection of 404 addressing agriculture, timbering, mining, and ranching. The enlargement of the Corps' jurisdiction after the Callaway decision created the problem that these activities increasingly entailed discharge permits. [145] Land left fallow, for example, might begin to revert to wetland, or a temporary logging road might affect runoff to wetlands. Subsection 404(f), an important feature of the 1977 Amendments to the CWA, was Congress' solution of this problem. [146] The purpose of the subsection is to protect established farming, silviculture, mining, and ranching operations from overly intrusive regulation. [147] Section 404(f)(1) exempts discharges associated with listed activities from the permit requirement. [148] Section 404(f)(2), the \"recapture clause,\" serves as a check on section 404(f)(1) by reinstating the requirement for discharges with certain excessively harmful effects. [149] The most important cases interpreting subsection 404(f) address the operation of the recapture clause in reaching once-exempt agricultural activities that had somehow changed since their initial exemption. [150] The approach of the Tulloch Rule is quite similar to that of a plan which had been suggested in two law review articles. [151] These articles urged a broad interpretation of section 404(f)(2), which has generally been thought of merely as a vehicle to recapture otherwise exempt activities listed in section 404(f)(1). [152] This new reading would allow the agencies to reach activities other than those in section 404(f)(1), rather than exempting the discharges from them as de minimis. [153] In the proposed scheme, the clause would now operate together with a de minimis exemption to allow the capture of activities formerly outside section 404 jurisdiction. [154] This novel application of section 404(f) (2) would bring an activity within the ambit of section 404 whenever its incidental discharge had the ultimate effect of changing the use of a wetland. [155] It is not clear whether the design of the Tulloch Rule derived from this proposal. To the extent that the rule reflected the proposal's scheme, however, it relied on a statutory interpretation that the weight of authority does not support. [156] V. C ONCLUSION As of this writing, the District of Columbia Circuit had denied the agencies a rehearing, [157] but they had not decided whether to appeal the National Mining decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. [158] The inventive nature of the defenses which the appellants pre sented, [159] however, reflects the weakness of the Tulloch Rule's foundation in law. In only one case does a decision squarely support the proposition that incidental fallback is a regulable discharge. [160] Even there, the district court specifically limited its holding to the direct effect of the fallback itself, and not the ultimate effect of the activity which produced it. [161] As the court suggested in National Mining , the Tulloch Rule seemed to be less a reasoned effort to interpret section 404 than a stratagem for extending the Corps' authority. [162]NATIONAL MINING 2:24:02 PM] National Mining vindicates the Corps' earlier caution in interpreting that authority. The CWA did not begin as a wetlands statute, nor was that the main purpose of section 404. [163] Its power to authorize regulations protecting wetlands is limited by this history. The Corps' decision to remedy this limitation by agreeing to propose what became the Tulloch Rule was ill-considered, as was the private suit which prompted this decision. Although other means of regulating wetlands are still available to the EPA and the Corps after National Mining ,[164] the decision significantly weakens section 404. If its strength is to be restored, then it is Congress, and not the agencies, which must create the needed authority. _______________________________[*] I am a third-year student at Washington University Law School with a particular interest in land-use and environmental law.

United States Army Corps of Eng'rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1402 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Return to text. [16] See id. at 1403. Return to text. [17] In 1986, the Corps published the rule that the Tulloch Rule superseded. See id. at 1401. The 1986 rule defined the term \"discharge of dredged material\" under section 404 as \"any addition of dredged material into the waters of the United States,\" excluding \"de minimis, incidental soil movement occurring during normal dredging operations.\" Final Rule for Regulatory Programs of the Corps of Engineers, 51 Fed. Reg. 41,206, 41,232 (1986). The Tulloch Rule changed this definition to include \" any addition of dredged material into, including any redeposit of dredged material within , the waters of the United States.\" 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.2(d)(1) (1998) (emphasis added). The revised definition also encompassed discharges of \"excavated material\" which were \" incidental to any activity , including mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization, or other excavation.\" \u00a7 323.2(d)(1)(iii) (emphasis added). Return to text. [18] Under the CWA, an \"addition\" is necessary for a \"discharge.\" 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(12) (1994 & Supp. II 1996). Without a \"discharge\" there can be no section 404 jurisdiction. See infra note 22. Return to text. [19] The CWA defines a point source as \"[a]ny discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged.\" 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(14) . Courts have also found various machines to be point sources. See, e.g., Avoyelles Sportsmen's League, Inc. v. Marsh, 715 F.2d 897, 922 (5th Cir. 1983) (finding bulldozers and land clearing equipment); United States v. Holland, 373 F. Supp. 665, 668 (M.D. Fla. 1974) (finding bulldozers, dump trucks, and draglines). Return to text. [20] The CWA defines a \"pollutant\" as \"dredged spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical waste, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, munici pal, and agricultural waste discharged into water.\" 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(6) . Return to text. [21] The CWA authorizes the Corps to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material \"into the navigable waters . . waters\" as \"the United States, 2:24:02 PM] the territorial seas.\" \u00a7 1362(7). It does not in turn define \"the waters of the United States.\" In its regulations, the Corps defines \"waters of the United States\" as all \"waters which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce, including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide.\" 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 328.3(1) (1998). This definition encompasses \"all interstate waters including interstate wetlands,\" id. at \u00a7 328.3(2), and wetlands adjacent to listed waters, \"other than waters which are themselves wetlands,\" id. \u00a7 328.3(7). For a detailed history of the expansion of the Corps' jurisdiction over navigable waters, see Hoyer, supra note 12, at 20- 25. Return to text. [22] \"Discharge\" means \"any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\" 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(12)(A). The \"discharge of a pollutant by any person\" is unlawful if not in compliance with the applicable CWA permit requirements. Id. \u00a7 1311(a). Because section 404 authorizes the Corps to issue permits \"for the discharge of dredged or fill material,\" no jurisdiction under that section exists without a \"discharge.\" \"The existence of discharge is critical. The discharge must be of effluent or dredged or fill material . . . . [O]n the face of the statute, it is the requirement for statutory coverage.\" Save Our Community v.

Section 402 gives the EPA authority over the most important of these, the NPDES permit program. See id . \u00a7 1342. Return to text. [28] Water movements in shipping channels shift and pile up bottom sediments, and the resulting shallows pose a hazard to navigation. Therefore large dredges are used to deepen the channel by excavating this built-up material. Once extracted, the material is often referred to as \"dredged spoil.\" Heavy weather increases the amount of dredging needed, and this amount therefore varies both by season and by year. See generally Allan Bakalian, Regulation and Control of United States Ocean Dumping: A Decade of Progress, an Appraisal for the Future, 8 H ARV. ENVT'L L. R EV. 193 (1984). Data available for 1979, a fairly representative year, show that more than 70 million cubic yards of dredged materials were dumped into oceans off the coasts of the United States. See id. at 204. The proportion of dredged spoil was almost eight times that of all other categories (e.g., sewage sludge, industrial wastes) combined. See id. Return to text. [29] Senator Ellender, for example, was concerned that SB 2770, the bill which resulted in the CWA, did not differentiate the disposal of dredged material from that of other effluents: \"[O]ne of the main deficiencies of this bill is that it treats dredged materials the same as industrial waste, sewage sludge, or refuse introduced into a river system, lake, estuary, or ocean. The disposal of dredged material does not involve the introduction of new pollutants; it merely moves the material from one location to another.\" L EGISLATIVE HISTORY (1972), supra note 12, at 1386 (statement of Sen. Ellender in Senate debate). Return to text. [30] \"The strict adherence to the [EPA's] published standards would result in 90 percent of the ports and harbors of the United States being closed, until such time as land disposal areas are provided. This would create a catastrophical situation with respect to our foreign and domestic commerce.\" Id. at 1387 (statement of Sen. Ellender in Senate debate); \"Will the Senator please tell me why . . . the Corps of Engineers only with respect to dredging should not be subject toNATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION hollins1.htm [7/7/2015 404 discharges] we are requiring of every other agency?\" Id. at 1388 (question by Sen. Muskie in Senate debate); \"In order to get their job done. This project [thirty diked dredged spoil disposal sites for the Great Lakes which Congress had earlier that year voted the Corps the funds to build] has got to stand by and wait and wait and wait for the application. The new agency [EPA] has not been in operation very long. I do not charge them with wrongdoing but they need time to develop.\" Id. (response of Sen. Stennis). Return to text. [31] The Corps was already exercising its authority under section 10 of the RHA to regulate discharges into waters which were actually navigable, see infra note 64. SB 2770, however, included dredged spoil, rock, sand and cellar dirt in its list of pollutants, which the EPA was to regulate under the NPDES. Whenever a discharge of these materials took place in navigable waters, therefore, both agencies would have permitting authority. Moreover, it seemed that the NPDES, by covering dredged spoil, would authorize the EPA to regulate the vast discharges caused by the Corps' own channel maintenance. See Power, supra note 12, at 522. Return to text. [32] Senator Ellender proposed section 404, which Congress enacted in substance, to exempt regulation of dredged material from the NPDES. See L EGISLATIVE HISTORY (1972), supra note 12, at 1388 (statement of Sen. Muskie in Senate debate) (\"What Senator Ellender's amendment would do would be to exempt dredging.\"); Power, supra note 12, at 522; Blumm, supra note 24, at 415. Return to text.

[35] Congress was pursuing this strategy even before it enacted the CWA. Two years earlier, it authorized the Corps to build and operate \"contained disposal facilities\" as part of the River and Harbor Act of 1970, Pub. L. 91-611, 84 Stat. 1823 (codified as amended at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293a. (1994 & Supp. II 1996)). Part of this section concerns agreements with state and local governments to acquire \"lands\" necessary for the facilities. Id. \u00a7 1293a(c). An early example of an alternative to open-water disposal of dredged spoil was a Corps project to build thirty diked disposal sites for harbors in the Great Lakes. See L EGISLATIVE HISTORY (1972), supra note 12, at 1386; see supra note 30 (response of Sen. Stennis). Return to text. [36] Senator Muskie, the main proponent of the CWA, did not want to exempt the Corps from its prohibitions. He therefore opposed Senator Ellender's amendment but could not prevent it. \"[T]here is no question that the Secretary of the Army should retain authority to permit dredging operations for the purpose of navigable water and channel maintenance. It is a mission-oriented agency, and this is its mission. . . .

[37] See infra notes 45-48 and accompanying text. Return to text. [38] Senator Muskie expressed this concern: \"[T]he Corps of Engineers . . . is not equipped to evaluate the environmental impact of these dredging activities. It is equipped to make judgments on what is needed for navigation . . . . [W]hat Section 401 would require is that [EPA evaluate] the pollution potential of the proposed dredge spoil and the environmental impact of disposing of dredge spoil in particular locations or sites . . . . If we eliminate those two checks by the only agency we have to evaluate environmental damage and make dredgers exempt [i.e., by enacting section 404 as proposed], as no one else is under this bill, from this kind of monitoring and supervision, it means releasing them from all control.\" L EGISLATIVE HISTORY (1972), supra note 12, at 1388 (statement of Sen. Muskie in Senate debate). Senator Muskie offered his own amendment, subsection 402(m), as an alternative to section 404. This provision would have given the EPA authority to regulate disposal of dredged material in waters not under RHA jurisdiction, on the basis of certain environmental effects. Section 402(m) would have required the EPA to consider the effects of disposal of dredged material on municipal water supplies, on shellfish beds, on wildlife, and on fisheries. See id. at 1392-93. These effects are reflected in the terms of subsection 404(c), under which the EPA may veto a permit proposal which the Corps has approved. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(c) (1994 & Supp. II 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 supra note 10, at 1075-76 (1991).

[54] The Corps kept its existing regulations despite significant decisions such as Holland and Ashland Oil. See Power, supra note 12, at 522. Extending jurisdiction above the level of the high tide line in order to protect wetlands makes it necessary to delineate the boundary between water and land by some other measure. It is more difficult to determine precisely the landward boundary of United States waters by using markers which tend not to change abruptly, for example soil or vegetation characteristics, than by using the traditional standard, the mean of nineteen years' measurements of the two daily high tide lines. Moreover, this delineation will often be made in flat land, where small differences in elevation correspond to large differences in the horizontal reach of water's edge.

Supp. 267 (D.D.C. 1997), in which the plaintiffs claimed that the Tulloch rule \"(1) is inconsistent with the language and intent of the CWA; (2) is arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with law . . . because it exempts navigational dredging, which is generally done by the Corps, and exempts landclearing from a grandfather clause; (3) violates plaintiffs' due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution because it (a) is vague, and (b) shifts to regulated parties the burden of showing that their activities are not covered; and (4) was promulgated in violation of the procedural requirements of the APA.\" Id. at 270 (citations omitted). In granting summary judgment for the plaintiffs, the District Court for the District of Columbia addressed only the first of these claims. See id. Return to text. [89] See National Mining Ass'n v. United States Army Corps of Eng'rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1403 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In their comments accompanying the Tulloch Rule, the agencies argued at length that the CWA authorized them to regulate redeposits on the basis of the effect of the activity producing them. Clean Water Act Regulatory Programs , 58 Fed. Reg. 45,008, 45,012 (1993) (emphasis added). For example, they stated that: \"EPA and the Corps do not believe that . . . [under the CWA] redeposition of dredged material is only regulated if it is \"moved\" from one \"place\" to another. Rather than focus simply on the spatial relationship between where the excavation and redeposition occur . . . [to determine] jurisdiction under Section 404, this rule will regulate an activity (involving a discharge to any part of waters of the U.S.) taking into account the effect of the activity on the aquatic environment.\" Id. (emphasis added). Return to text. [90] National Mining, 145 F.3d at 1403-04, also contains several secondary arguments, which are discussed briefly here. The appellants urged the court to review the Tulloch Rule under the very lenient standard of judicial review which a Supreme Court case construing a bail statute, United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987), established for facial challenges to federal statutes. See National Mining, 145 F.3d at 1406. The court termed this a \"last-ditch\" argument, but then took pains to refute it. The court refused to accept that the facial nature of the challenge, by itself, required it to depart from the Chevron standard, or from its own precedents regarding administrative rulemaking. See id . at 1407-08. The court noted in passing that a facial challenge is sometimes improper, as when its success depends on an assumption that the agency will act in bad faith. See id. It said that the challenge here, however, was rather that the agencies exceeded their statutory authority by applying Tulloch faithfully. See id . at 1408. The agencies also argued that Congress' exemption of minor deposits from certain activities in subsection 404(f) was evidence that it considered section 404 in general to cover incidental fallback. See id . at 1405; see also discussion infra Part III.B. for a description of subsection 404(f). In this argument, Congress' use of the phrase \"discharge of dredged or fill material\" to describe the consequences of activities listed in section 404(f)(1) showed that it believed incidental fallback to be a type of discharge. See id. at 1405. The National Mining court, however, was not persuaded by this reading of subsection 404(f). It said that Congress could just as easily have been addressing activities which produced actual discharges, and not merely incidental fallback. See id. A final argument challenged the district court's issuance of a nationwide injunction setting aside the Tulloch Rule. The District of Columbia Circuit upheld the district court's use of this remedy, citing its own rule that \"when a reviewing court determines that agency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated\u2014not that their application to the individual petitioners is proscribed.\" Id. at 1409 (citation omitted). The court also cited Justice Blackmun's dissenting opinion in Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation , 497 U.S. 871, 913 (1990), for a rule which it took to be the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court justices on this question. This is that a broadly applicable administrative rule is invalid generally when a single plaintiff wins a claim that it has injured him.

To introduce \"students to the resources that environmental lawyers use and the activities in which they routinely engage.\" [4] Such an ambition is grand for a single volume, but this single volume does explain the rudimentary elements of environmental law practice clearly and concisely and in enough detail to permit the student to understand where to begin in attacking an environmental law issue. Several features are unique about this book. First, it explains environmental law from the views of public interest, government, and private practice attorneys. Second, the book challenges students to not only passively learn the law, but to act on that learning through thoughtful problems and exercises aimed at forcing students to put into practice what they have learned from all viewpoints. Finally, this book centers its lessons around the four most common settings in which an environmental lawyer can find one's self: environmental compliance; environmental enforcement; environmental litigation; and environmental policy. C HAPTER ONE: ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE Chapter One introduces students to the basic research tools environmental lawyers must utilize to advocate on behalf of their clients and ensure their clients remain in compliance with the complex maze of statutory law and agency regulations. Specifically, Chapter One goes through a quick summary of \"notice and comment\" rulemaking and provides an in-depth introduction to the form and content of the Code of Federal Regulations. The centerpiece of Chapter One is a problem scenario that leads the student through the process of complying with the Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program. In the context of this problem scenario, the authors explain federal statutes in the United States Code Annotated as the starting point for research on compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Next, the role of legislative history and an introduction to the U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News is discussed to place the statute in the context of the process that it arose out of. Then the authors explain what a regulation is and provide examples of applicable regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations. Case law does get some treatment and it is at this point that the authors include Alabama Power Co. v. Costle [5] to show how the courts handle the interplay of statutes, legislative history, and agency regulations. Next the authors explain the value and give an example of a preamble statement in the Federal Register that accompanies a proposed rule. Finally agency guidance documents are identified and explained as a probable source of valuable information. Through the problem scenario of ensuring compliance with the Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program, the authors effectively sketch out all the commonly useful sources of information available to environmental lawyers working on such an issue. Chapter One concludes with a broad discussion of an environmental lawyer's duties when counseling a client on an ambiguous legal issue. This discussion begins with an excerpt form a law review article on exactly this topic. [6] Next there is a brief recitation of some applicable ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. Chapter One closes with anther excerpt from a law review article on the interplay of legal ethics, environmental law, and rules of professional conduct. [7] This final section of Chapter One does not lay out the law in a black letter manner, but introduces the student to applicable rules and thoughtful commentary on how those rules fit into an environmental law context. This approach challenges the student to actively participate in the discussion by completing the attending exercises andBOOK REVIEW finklea1.htm [7/7/2015 2:23:43 PM] problems, without being dogmatic in approach. CHAPTER TWO: ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT Chapter Two introduces the student to the process of enforcing environmental laws, from the perspective of the agency, the perspective of a private attorney who represents some entity against whom an enforcement action is being brought, and the perspective of a private attorney working in the public interest by bringing a private citizens' enforcement action. Though these three perspectives normally diverge, Chapter Two introduces students to the process of enforcement from each perspective and draws out the similarities and differences inherent in those divergent positions. Chapter Two provides enough of a brief, but thorough overview to allow the student to know where to begin when faced with an enforcement action, no matter which perspective the student, as a lawyer, may be advocating. Chapter Two begins with a description of the agency enforcement process including: self-reporting obligations, inspections, different types of enforcement actions, and administrative practice considerations. Next, there is a discussion of the different sources of the law that will be useful to an environmental practitioner when dealing with an enforcement action. This includes a discussion of the EPA's different types of enforcement response policies and a brief discussion of how unpublished case opinions and administrative law opinions also play an important role in the research universe the student should be aware of regarding environmental enforcement. The first major division of Chapter Two ends with a discussion of the different issues that can arise in environmental enforcement includeing: defenses, penalty amounts, and other issues like public relations and the degree of agency discretion available. These issues are discussed in a common-sense manner, with the emphasis on putting this knowledge to work in practice. Chapter Two also includes an extensive discussion on citizen suit enforcement of environmental laws. While the first major division of Chapter Two applied mostly to agency lawyers and private practice lawyers, this division of the chapter relating to citizens suits speaks directly to public interest lawyers. First the authors describe the process of information gathering for a large citizen suit enforcement action. Finally the discussion delves into the various issues that are common to citizen suits, including: pre-suit notice, requirements of diligent prosecution, standing issues, whether the defendant is \"in violation,\" potential recovery, and issues particular to suits against the EPA or state agencies. The subject matter of Chapter Two, environmental enforcement, could encompass many volumes in its own right, but the authors give environmental enforcement just enough coverage to make students aware of the basic process of enforcement from all three positions commonly found in an enforcement action. While not exhaustive in its coverage, Chapter Two does provide enough of an introduction to environmental enforcement to allow the student, as a lawyer, to understand how to begin the process of advocacy, no matter the position being advocated. C HAPTER THREE : ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION In many ways environmental litigation is no different from any other litigation, but there are usually some specific types of litigation issues that arise in environmental litigation. To introduce students to those issues Chapter Three is divided into two principle parts. The first introduces students to issues that normally arise in Superfund litigation, one of the most common types of contemporary environmental litigation. The second part of Chapter Three introduces students to more common issues that can occur in environmental litigation. Again the litigation issues that are highlighted in Chapter Three can apply equally to public interest, government, and private practice attorneys. All potential student perspectives derive a benefit from the discussion. The Superfund litigation discussion begins with a basic explanation of the Superfund remediation process. Next is a more detailed explanation of the Superfund liability scheme, including a detailed fact scenario that can be used by the student to critically think about and act on the basic explanation provided in the text. It is this detailed fact scenario that sets this book apart from others that strive to reach the same audience. The Shenandoah Superfund Site scenario is set out in great detail and every other facet of the chapter somehow brings the student back to examine the lessons of the text, in connection with that fact scenario. This active learning paradigm is what sets this book apart from others. The Superfund litigation issues highlighted are: section 107 liability, joint and several liability, consistency with the National Contingency Plan, choice of remedies, section 107(b) defenses, and statutes of limitations. The Superfund litigation discussion ends with an excerpt from a law review article that concisely explains Superfund litigation issuesBOOK REVIEW finklea1.htm [7/7/2015 2:23:43 PM] in a way that perfectly sums up the authors' discussion. [8] The remainder of Chapter Three is devoted to introducing the student to other important issues that frequently arise in environmental litigation. First, the authors use another law review excerpt [9] to explain the particular issue of successor liability in environmental litigation generally and in Superfund litigation in particular. Next, there is a brief explanation of issues involving municipal solid waste, followed by brief explanations of interim landowner liability and innocent landowner liability. Individual liability and section 106 penalties are also all discussed in the context of environmental litigation generally and in the context of Superfund litigation particularly. Chapter Three comes to a close with a brief explanation of Superfund cost allocation, including the Gore factors, [10] and settlement. The second part of Chapter Three explains issues that arise in environmental litigation, but still focuses that explanation on the context of Superfund litigation. However, the tenor of the explanation is not so geared toward Superfund litigation that the student could not apply that explanation to other types of environmental litigation. Chapter Three provides a brief, but thorough explanation of the issues that arise in Superfund litigation particularly and other types of environmental litigation generally. C HAPTER FOUR: ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY Chapter Four introduces the student to environmental policy and policymaking in the context of administrative rulemaking. The central focus of Chapter Four is to introduce the rulemaking process to the student in a way that provides an explanation of the public interest, government, and private practice attorney's roles in that rulemaking process. While a quick overview of \"notice and comment\" rulemaking was included in Chapter One, Chapter Four provides a detailed explanation of the \"notice and comment\" rulemaking process. This explanation of rulemaking is followed by an explanation of the various ways that a lawyer can enter the rulemaking process. Finally, Chapter Four, and the book as a whole, ends with a brief explanation of the evolving environmental justice movement. Rulemaking is the central mechanism that a lawyer can use to effectuate a client's wishes in shaping environmental policy. [11] Chapter Four provides a detailed explanation of the federal informal, or \"notice and comment,\" rulemaking process. This explanation begins with discussion of the requirements for the EPA to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking. Next there is an explanation of the public comment process, followed by an explanation of the require ments for the final agency rule. Beyond the this basic outline of \"notice and comment\" rulemaking, the authors also provide the student with a brief explanation of how environmental lawyers can use an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to their advantage and how the process of negotiated rulemaking works. The rulemaking process discussion ends with an explanation of how some environmental statutes provide for additional rulemaking procedures. Rulemaking is the elemental tool for the environmental lawyer involved in environmental policy making. The knowledgeable environmental lawyer, however, needs to know how to involve one's self in the rulemaking process. Chapter Four next explains how the environmental lawyer can become involved in the rulemaking process. To begin, the authors provide three ways that a private practice or public interest lawyer can initiate rulemaking in the EPA. A private practice or public interest lawyer can sue the agency to enforce environmental statu tory deadlines. Or, a private practice or public interest lawyer can petition the EPA to issue a rule to fill a perceived need. Or, a private practice or public interest lawyer can sue the EPA to enforce \"notice and comment\" rulemaking requirements. For this last option, the authors explain four exceptions to \"notice and comment\" rulemaking procedures: (1) the exception for \"interpretive (2) the exception for \"general statements of policy,\" (3)the exception for rules of \"agency organization, procedure, or practice,\" and (4) the \"good cause\" exception. [12] The authors' explanation of involvement in the rulemaking process ends with a admonishment to private practice or public interest lawyers to advocate clients' interests at the earliest stage of the rulemaking process, because once the rulemaking process gets going the EPA becomes too entrenched in its own position to be seriously swayed by any amount of lawyering. However, the authors also explain the final agency rule can be chal enged in court after its final promulgation by the agency and briefly sketch out that process. Chapter Four and the book is brought to a conclusion with an introduction to the environmental justice movement. This brief overview of environmental justice quickly touches on the facts of environmental discrimination, federal actions that promote environmental justice, and environmental justice litigation. This introductory explanation of the environmental justice movement barely lasts four pages. The remainder of Chapter Four is devoted to the EPA's InterimBOOK REVIEW finklea1.htm [7/7/2015 2:23:43 PM] Guidance for Investigating Title VI Administrative Complaints Challenging Permits, [13] followed by a set of problems meant to get the student to think critically about environmental discrimina tion and the environmental justice movement. CRITIQUES AND CONCLUSIONS As a whole the book achieves the goals of the authors, to introduce students to the resources environmental lawyers use and the activities they routinely engage in. However, the book does suffer from several weaknesses. The most obvious weakness is the lack of detailed discussion on various issues brought to the fore. The explanations and discussions the book does engage in are thorough, given their brevity, but the student is left with only a thumbnail sketch of issues. For a book that only strives to introduce these issues to students, a thumbnail sketch may be sufficient. However, the nature of the problems and exercises the authors use in the book often require more knowledge or information than is available in the text. The problems and exercises are frequently more involved than the text adequately provides for. If this book is used in an advanced environmental law class, where students already have an underlying knowledge of the basic resources of environmental law, then it will be a valuable resource. For knowledgeable students the problems and exercises will be an interesting and realistic way to put into practice what they already know and what the text has added to that knowledge. However, if this book were used in an introductory environmental law class, then the problems and exercises may overwhelm students because of their detail and complexity. Again, the explanations of various issues in the book are brief, but thorough. For the advanced environmental law student, these explanations will suffice. For beginning students, however, the explanations may not provide enough black letter law to make the practice tips, problems, and exercises truly instructional. The problems and exercises in the book are what the authors use to tie the legal explanations together with real-world practicality. The practicality of this book is its hallmark. In the contemporary field of legal education where there is a concern for being too practical, this book is welcome convergence of concise explanations of environmental legal issues and practicality.

Introduction The United Nations General Assembly declared 1998 the International Year of the Ocean in order to raise awareness of the oceans and the need to protect and conserve our marine resources through actions at the global, regional, and national levels. The oceans of the world are vital to all yet belong to no one. It touches every aspect of our lives from commerce to recreation to medicine. As Earth becomes less about national and regional divisions and more like one global village, due in great part to the advent of the World Wide Web, governments, industry, and individuals alike have come to realize that many of the issues we face in our own backyard others around the world face as well. In order to prevent a few from taking control of a resource of the many and to prevent a \"tragedy of the commons,\" international law has been created in the form of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. It is laws such as this on a global scale and interpretations of it on a national scale that has caused the proliferation of this important, and often hotly contested, body of jurisprudence. For a few years now, this Journal has made a commitment to helping its readers utilize the Internet as an integral and economically feasible way to conduct legal research on all kinds of environmental and land use topics. With the enormous scope of this area of the law, however, it becomes necessary to narrow the field a bit in order to better explore what information the Internet has to offer. In recent observance of the International Year of the Ocean in 1998 and the growing importance of our global seas and shores, this review has compiled a variety of recommended web sites focused on this area of law and policy. The addresses are categorized under various topic areas for easy reference. These topic areas are Federal Government Agencies and Organizations, Florida Government Agencies and Organizations, Libraries and Directories, Magazines and Online News Services, Miscellaneous Oceans and Coastal Sites, Non-Profit and Other Activist Organizations, Non-U.S. Agencies and Information, Other State/Regional Agencies and Organizations, and Research Facilities, Organizations, and Projects. With the ever-growing popularity of the Internet as a forum of communication and shared knowledge, the number of web sites available are astronomical. Therefore, this list is far from inclusive but is meant instead to give a flavor for what is accessible through the Internet. II.
