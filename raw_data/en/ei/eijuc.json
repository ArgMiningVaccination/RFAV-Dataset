In 1924, a group of them asked Rudolf Steiner to hold an agricultural course in Koberwitz. This is today recognised as the birth of biodynamic agriculture. Rudolf Steiner described soil as the digestive organ of a plant, indicating that agriculture should focus on nourishing soil and not the plant itself. Only in vital soil food can grow harmoniously. At Whitsun, Rudolf Steiner held eight lectures entitled \"Spiritual foundations for the renewal of Agriculture\" at Koberwitz, Silesia. The Experimental Circle of Anthroposophical Farmers immediately tested Steiner's indications in daily farming practice. Three years later a Co-operative was formed to market biodynamic produce. The Demeter symbol was introduced and registered as a trademark, and the first standards for Demeter quality control formulated. Approx. 1000 biodynamic farms in existence. All Demeter-Organisations and the monthly magazine \"Demeter\" are forbidden in Germany through the NSDAP. The first issue of \"Lebendige Erde\" (\"Living In Darmstadt the 'Institute for Biodynamic Research' was founded. Scientific research work began in partnership with German Universities, and other worldwide organisations. Demeter is the first organic body to produce standards for food processing. 19 independent Demeter organisations, with representatives from Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and United States of America come together to form Demeter-International e.V. The 75th anniversary of Biodynamics. Important steps are being made on the way to a world-wide trade organisation. Demeter introduces a new logo.

From Italian antipasti, whole grain bread, first class wines and award winning ice-cream to clothes and toilet articles. Demeter is the biggest provider of organic goods world-wide. The [ ](http://www.ibda.ch/)International Biodynamic Association (IBDA) is founded on the 1st of November 2002 - including ownership and protection of the trademark \"Demeter\" and \"Biodynamic\" all over the world. Demeter-International and the International Biodynamic Association (IBDA) have joined forces to form the Biodynamic Federation - Demeter International. The new international umbrella organisation thus unites all Biodynamic and Demeter organisations worldwide. The Federation was launched during the annual conference of the Agricultural Section at the Goetheanum in Switzerland in the first week of February 2020. The Federation welcomes 9 new members from Malaysia, Ecuador, China, Uruguay, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republic, Lithuania, Sri Lanka and Turkey.
