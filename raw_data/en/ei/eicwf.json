I'll talk about these in a moment. First, though, as with diapers, the most eco-friendly option for wet wipes is to choose reusables where possible. Table of Contents How does this work in practice though? After all, it's hard to deny the convenience of pulling a disposable wet wipe out of a plastic pack and then throwing it in the trash (never flush them!). We'll cover our top picks for reusable baby wipes below, which are by and large the more sustainable choice. If you need a disposable pack in a pinch though, you can [click here](#disposables) to jump down to our wrapup of the best disposable wipes currently on the market too. Need some disposable diapers just in case too? We've got you covered there as well with our list of the [best sustainable disposable diapers](https://www.leafscore.com/eco-friendly-kids-products/best-eco-friendly-disposable-diapers/). Best reusable baby wipes Best disposable wipes The Best Eco-Friendly Reusable Baby Wipes [ImseVimse Organic Cotton Washable Reusable Baby Wipes](https://amzn.to/3jSpjko) Highlights: Reasonably priced wipes that are made of 100% GOTS certified organic cotton flannel. [Affiliate disclosure](/affiliate-disclosure/) My favorite eco-friendly reusable wet wipes are the very reasonably priced ImseVimse Organic Cotton Washable Reusable Wipes that come in packs of 12 and are made of 100% GOTS certified organic cotton flannel. The company uses GOTS certified fiber-reactive dyes, which are low-impact synthetic dyes that directly bond with the garment fibers, so they don't leach from the fabric. Their pads are all dyed aside from the natural ones, which are the ones I'd choose. [Burt's Bees Baby Washcloths](https://amzn.to/3oSxLUL) Highlights: Made with GOTS certified organic cotton that is absorbent and super soft. [Affiliate disclosure](/affiliate-disclosure/) Burt's Bees Baby Washcloths are another great choice. These are made with GOTS certified organic cotton that is absorbent, super soft, and knit terrycloth smooth on one side and with a loop texture on the other. They are neatly finished with a 100% organic cotton trim, currently priced very reasonably at around $12 for six, and measure 8.5 inches square. [OsoCozy Organic Flannel Baby Wipes](https://amzn.to/38c6C94) Highlights: These wipes are absorbent, soft, and made with organic cotton that's entirely unbleached. [Affiliate disclosure](/affiliate-disclosure/) If you're keen on something with a homemade feel, check out the organic flannelette baby wipes from OsoCozy. These measure 9 inches square, are made with organic cotton harvested according to SKAL International Standards for Sustainable Textile Production and come in a 12-pack priced at just $13.50. They are absorbent, soft, and made with unbleached fabric, so no need to worry about toxic chemicals. They're made in the USA by stay at home moms and grandmas. [Geffen Baby Wipes](https://geffenbaby.com/collections/wipes) Highlights: The hemp in these wipes makes them a bit better for the environment and more absorbent than regular organic cotton. [Affiliate disclosure](/affiliate-disclosure/) Geffen Baby currently offer two types of reusable wipes: a French Terrycloth with one smooth and one slightly textured side and a soft Jersey Knit. Both are soft and absorbent and measure 9 inches square. The cloths are made in the US and comprise 60% hemp and 40% organic cotton, with the hemp making these cloths a bit better for the environment and more absorbent than regular organic cotton. Why Reusable Wipes? My suggestion is to have a set of either the ImseVimse or OsoCozy cloths and a second set of the Burt's Bees or Geffen Baby cloths. The latter are great for situations where you want a bit more absorption and the former work for pretty much everything else. The ImseVimse cloths are ever so slightly bigger than the Burt's Bees washcloths and cost $10.99-$16.99 for 12, making them quite a bit more affordable too. Again, plenty of companies will try to sell you 'eco-friendly' bamboo cloth, but the better options by far are the organic cotton, hemp, linen, or wool (in a thinner weave). In a pinch, you can even reuse newborn diaper inserts as wet wipes. Used wet wipes can be added to the diaper pail for laundering later. Reusable cloth wet wipes are happily free from plastic packaging and will biodegrade within six months to a year when you're done with them. Maybe you raised your eyebrows at the price of reusable organic cloth wipes. If so, consider this: disposable wet wipes can cost anywhere from 4-40 cents per wipe; given that you'll probably use at least as many wipes as diapers in the first year of a baby's life and will keep wipes on hand for many years to come, this could easily amount to a staggering $800 on wet wipes alone! For me, that certainly puts into perspective the cost of a set of a dozen or so reusable organic cotton wipes. If you're on the go and just need a handy pack of wet wipes ASAP, there are some more eco-friendly, non-toxic disposable wet wipes available. Best Eco-Friendly Disposable Wet Wipes If reusable wipes aren't for you, you'll want to look for disposable wet wipes made with organic cotton or wood pulp, that are biodegradable and free from fragrances, alcohol, parabens, phthalates, irritants, allergens, endocrine disruptors, and other potentially toxic or troublesome ingredients. Here are my top picks for genuinely eco-friendly, non-toxic disposable baby wet wipes. [Natracare Organic Cotton Baby Wipes](https://amzn.to/3864VdC) Highlights: These wipes are soft, strong, and biodegradable as well as compostable - and you can start to see them in your typical stores!

[The Honest Company Baby Wipes](https://amzn.to/3ei1hOR) Highlights: These wipes are made from biodegradable organic cotton, and mostly non-toxic. [Affiliate disclosure](/affiliate-disclosure/) One final option for disposable wet wipes comes from Honest. They now offer dry wipes made with 100% organic cotton, without alcohol, parabens, fragrances or chlorine processing. Honest's wet wipes are made with plant-based ingredients (though they don't disclose the actual fibers), are biodegradable and mostly non-toxic. The main chemical of concern in the wipes is [ ethylhexylglycerin](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/702352-ethylhexylglycerin/) (also known as 1,2-propanediol), which can be an irritant to skin, potentially causing contact dermatitis or sensitizing skin to other chemicals, can cause serious eye damage, and can be toxic to humans and to aquatic life. The wipes also contain sodium benzoate, which may be toxic, although the small amounts in the wipes is unlikely to prove problematic. How to Make DIY Wet Wipes The good news is that it's super easy to go zero waste with wet wipes. All you need is a Mason jar and some old blankets, clothes, or other fabric, preferably organic cotton, hemp, or wool. Cut the fabric into squares about 9 inches by 9 inches, fill the jar with water and a teaspoon of coconut oil, cap it and give it a shake, then add the cloth squares. If you like, you can add a dash of essential oil such as chamomile or tea tree to the water. Use the wipes as needed, just replace the water every couple of days. For wet wipes you can use when out and about, just take a handful of wipes from the jar, gently squeeze out excess water, and zip the wipes up in a small wet bag such as this sealable silicone pouch ( [View Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3mMgStD)). Make sure to wash your wipes in an environmentally friendly manner and pass them on or repurpose them once your baby is out of diapers. You can easily reuse cloth wet wipes as napkins, cleaning cloths, or even get sewing and make a handy face mask. And, of course, bonus points if you can make your own wet wipes from scraps of soft material you already have lying around. If you don't have scraps of fabric lying about, you can find reusable cloth squares perfect for wet wipes made with organic cotton, hemp, and other natural fibers.
