Dear Readers The first half of the year is behind us. On the 15th May 2011 the voters of Basel voted in favour of the bill regarding the public hospitals in the canton of Basel and thus for the independence of the University Hospital of Basel. This decision will allow the USB to be favourably placed in the intensifying competition amongst the hospitals. After nearly 40 years of active and successful employment teaching and researching at the Department of Biomedicine Uwe Otten left the DBM at the end of April 2011. The research of Uwe Otten was honoured by means of an International symposium on the 28th April 2011 (page 29). I would like to thank Uwe Otten again for his many contributions and his contagious enthusiasm! In this summer edition of DBM Facts Matthias Wymann brings us into the world of lipid signal transduction in inflamma - tory processes and cancer (page 2 ), and Albert Neutzner teaches us more about the research into pathophysiology of the development of glaucoma (page 8). One main focus of this issue is on the foreign aid that is given by members of the DBM. Frances Kern describes her stay at a leper colony in Katmandu (page 30) and Vivian Kiefer tells us about her divers projects relating to her involvement with the Society for Filipino migrants \"Maharlika Schweiz\" (page 37). Enjoy reading, have a lovely summer and relax well!DBM Facts 2|2011 Departement Biomedizin2 WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE INSTITUT F \u00dcR BIOCHEMIE UND GENETIK Lipid Signaling in Physiology and Disease - from Molecular Mechanism to PI3K Targeting Strategies From top left: Vladmimir Cmiljanovic PTEN SHIP PI3KcPI3Kr PI(4,5)P2H HHOH HH OH 35 HO OOO PPP HO PI(3,4)P2H HHOH HH OH 35 HO OOO P PP OH Cardiovascular disease,hypertension, hypertrophyCancer Chronic inflammation, Allergy Autoimmune disease, transplant rejection To serve us well, all cells in our body have to fulfil their task in a concerted action. Normally, cells receive and release signals and integrate them properly. These sig - nals are processed by cell surface or intra-cellular recep - tors coupled to a plethora of intracellular signal trans - duction cascades. In diseases like chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, cancer, but also cardiovascular disease - and even back pain, cellular signals overshoot and can cause morbidity and death. Many signal transduction pathways start at membranes (Wymann and Schneiter, 2008), and it is here where the lipid kinase called phos - phoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) acts. PI3K - lar hemostasis and contributes to the over-activation of many cell types. In this respect, PI3Ks have been shown to be key in the control of cellular metabolism, growth, proliferation, survival and migration, intracellu - lar membrane transport, secretion and more (see Fig. 1, (Wymann and Marone, 2005)). Cancer and inflammatory disease include a wide variety of disorders with a broad degree of severity and clinical outcome. But in essence both emerge from pre-exist - ing, but derailed physiologic repair and defense mech - anisms. When a cell switches from a quiescent to an activated state to enter a tissue repair or host defense mode, this often involves the activation of PI3K. Phosphoinositides - hemostasis and disease Cell surface receptor-controlled PI3Ks are called class I PI3Ks, and are the only ones to produce the lipid Pt - dIns(3,4,5) P 3. PtdIns(3,4,5) P3 provides docking sites for signaling molecules with lipid receptor domains (Lem - mon, 2008) at the inner leaflet of the plasma mem - brane, and the lipid is thus a nucleation point for many signaling cascades. One of the master kinases recruited by PtdIns(3,4,5) P 3 is the Ser/Thr protein kinase B (PKB, also called Akt). PKB indirectly activates the target of ra - pamycin (TOR or mammalian TOR, mTOR), which is an important hub sensing energy and nutrient supply to regulate protein synthesis and growth. Crucial findings of the PI3K/PKB/TOR pathway have been contributed by groups that are present in Basel: the identification of the first PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Arcaro and Wymann, 1993) made PI3K everybody, the cloning of PKB (called \"Rac kinase\" at that time; (Jones et al., 1991) provided the first down - stream target for PI3K, and the discovery of the TOR complex (Kunz et al., 1993) initiated the elucidation of nutrient sensing and growth control. In the last two de - cades, the PI3K/PKB/TOR field came a long way: while the signaling map was essentially blank in the early nine - ties, a dense and complex network of signaling compo - nents was uncovered in the mean time. The achieve - ments of the field will be celebrated with a dedicated conference (TOR, PI3K and Akt - 20 years on; see http://www.torandmore.org) here in Basel in September.PtdIns(3,4,5) P 3 does not only recruit PKB, but also trig - Fig. 1. Coupling of PI3K signaling to physi - ologic processes and disease. Upon cell surface receptor stimulation, class I PI3K heterodimers produce PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 at the plasma membrane to provide docking sites for pleckstrin homology domain contain - ing proteins like protein kinase B (PKB). The processes listed at the bottom of the scheme were connected to the displayed signaling pathways using genetic and pharmacologi - cal evidence. For further details of the role of lipid signaling in disease see (Wymann and of guanine nucleotide exchange fac - tors (GEFs), which subsequently increase Rho GTPase activity and initiate cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell polarity and migration. The importance of PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 levels in disease has been validated by the loss of one of the counter-players of PI3Ks: when the lipid 3'-phosphatase PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homo - log deleted on chromosome Ten) is lost, PtdIns(3,4,5) P 3 levels rise, and the lipid shows its oncogenic poten - tial (Zhang and Yu, 2010). Most cases of Cowden Syn - drome are due mutations in PTEN, and result in the for - mation of hyperplasia and adenoma, which constitute early forms of cancer. The lack of lipid phosphatases degrading PtdIns(3,5) P 2 or PtdIns-3- P causes progres - sive disease, for example mutations in the gene coding for myotubularin 1 (MTM1) cause X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), in 2 (Mtmr2) can cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B1 (CMT4B1, (Berger et al., 2002; Cao et al., 2008)). These aberrant changes il - lustrate how a delicate balance between lipid kinase and lipid phosphatase activities is required to maintain the flux through the phosphoinositide pathway, and that phosphoinositide levels play an important part in cellu - lar homeostasis (Fig. 1). Our research group has a long-standing interest in PI3K signaling in inflammation and cancer. To investi - gate these fields, we have, in the past,initiated several programs to study the role of various PI3K isoforms by genetic and pharmacological means. Latest efforts also include the production of chemical tools to eluci - date spatial PI3K signaling. Recent results have demon - strated that PI3K produces functionally distinct pools in membrane micro-domains. Spatial regulation of PI3K signaling - context depen - dent in- and output PI3Ks are constituted of an adaptor and a catalytic sub - unit. We have recently established, that the adaptor subunit can selectively relay PI3K signaling to distinct cellular responses. Using bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) derived from PI3K null mice, we could establish reconstitution assays combining the catalyt - ic subunit of PI3K (called p110 ) with one of the two adapter units p84 or p101. Interestingly, both adapter units promoted chemotaxis in response to ligands of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), but only the p84- p110 complex participated in mast cell degranulation responses. The reason for this remained a riddle, until it became clear that the p101-p110 complex produced PtdIns(3,4,5) P 3 at the plasma membrane that was rap - idly internalized after GPCR stimulation (Fig. 2A; for details see (Bohnacker et al., 2009)). In brief, this work established for the first time the existence of distinct, functionally non-redundant pools of PtdIns(3,4,5) P 3 in the plasma membrane. These two lipid pools could Fig. 2. Spatial signaling by PI3K in adenosine stimulated bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs): PI3K is composed of an adapter subunit (either p84 or p101) and a catalytic subunit p110 . A) When activated, the p101-p110 complex produced PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 at the plasma membrane at early times, but PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 was internalized >60 seconds after stimulation. PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 is detected here with a pleckstrin homology from Bruton's tyrosine kinase fused to GFP (PH while 2 is depicted in red (PHPLC PLC-RFP). Interestingly, PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 clearly segregates from PtdIns(4,5)P 2, although the latter is present at a 100x higher concentration in the plasma membrane as compared to PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3. B) The phosphory - lation of the PI3K downstream target PKB/Akt is sensitive to co-expression of the RasGAP NF1 when initiated by p84-p110 , while p101-p110 complexes relay the GPCR signal in a Ras-inde - pendent fashion. The phosphorylation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) was used as an indicator of the Ras status, as active Ras is required to induce the Raf/MEK/MAPK axis. DBM Facts 2|2011 Department of BiomedicineINSTITUTE OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND GENETICS WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE 5 A Balso be distinguished by their different sensitivity to cholesterol depletion. Furthermore, it could be estab - lished that the p84-p110 complex could only signal in the presence of activated, GTP-bound Ras, while p101-p110 complexes were resistant to Ras inactivation (e.g. by the action of the Ras GTPase activating protein NF1, Fig. 2B; (Kurig et al., 2009)). Moreover, it became clear that PI3K can be activated by the phosphorylation by protein kinase C in mast cells. This process requires the influx of extracellular Ca 2+ through store operated Ca2+ channels, and supports sustained mast cell activation in a late phase (Walser et al. , unpublished). In contrast to the activation by PKC , protein kinase C-terminal (Perino et al., 2011). Ongoing work illustrates that PI3K is a heav - ily regulated enzyme, and that PI3K - which normally operates downstream of GPCRs - can be disconnected from GPCRs to relay Ca 2+ signaling. The insight obtained in the regulation of PI3K signaling can be exploited to develop cell and tissue-specific targeting strategies for PI3K in allergy: presently explore possibilities to phar - macologically inactivate mast cells, without affecting the action of cells involved in host-defense reactions. A Role for PI3K in obesity and thermogenesis As mentioned above, PI3K plays a central role in the control of adhesion, migration, degranulation, and car - diac contractility. When mice without functional PI3K are fed a normal diet (chow diet), no changes in body weight or fat are apparent during their lifespan as com - pared to wild type animals. It was therefore a surprise that PI3K null mice remained lean on a high fat diet, while wild type counterparts increased fat mass, and developed a type II diabetes phenotype including insu - lin resistance and increased blood glucose levels (col - laboration with G. Solinas, Fribourg). In parallel, PI3K null mice were also protected from a dramatic hepatic steatosis found in wild type animals on high fat diet. As cytokine levels and macrophages in adipose tissue were increased on high fat diet, we initially assumed that hematopoietic cells would play a major role in the development of obesity and insulin resistance, as we have observed previously that macrophage migration towards inflamed tissues is impaired in PI3K null mice (for a review see (Wymann et al., 2003)). Bone marrow transplantations demonstrated, however, that the role of PI3K in obesity was mainly restricted to the host tissue, not the hematopoietic system (Fig. 3). Calori - metric measurements revealed that PI3K plays a role in the regulation of thermogenesis, and is increasingly expressed in white and brown fat of obese animals. In - activation of PI3K thus renders mice obesity resistant by increasing adaptive heat dissipation and oxygen consumption, while calorie intake remains unaltered (Becattini et al. ; PNAS, under revision). While the PI3K - dependent non-hematopoietic tissue could include adipocytes, the involved cell types and the exact under - lying mechanism will have to be studied using tissue-specific knock-out mice. The above findings, together with previous results obtained in mouse models of ath - erosclerosis (Fougerat et al., 2008), hypertension (Vec - chione et al., 2005), cardiac hypertrophy (Crackower et al., 2002; Patrucco et al., 2004) and thrombus forma - Fig. 3. Mouse chimeras were produced using wild type and PI3K null host animals and wild type and PI3K null bone marrow. The four resulting combinations are depicted in A). B) The gain of body weight was linked to the wild type host body, but inde - pendent of the presence of PI3K in the compart al., 2001), suggest that targeting of PI3K might be attractive in obesity-related insulin resistance and associated cardiovascular disease conditions. Individual class I PI3K isoforms in cancer Initially, class I PI3Ks were discovered to be associated with viral oncogens, and for the last two decades the link between cancer and elevated PtdIns(3,4,5) P 3 levels has been corroborated. While activating mutations are fre - quently found in the catalytic subunit of PI3K (called p110 ) in a wide variety of tumors, also the PI3K iso- form plays a role in cancer progression, including breast (Ciraolo et al., 2008) and prostate cancer. As a conse - quence, pan-PI3K inhibitors were successfully used to attenuate tumor progression ((Marone et al., 2009); for a review see (Marone et al., 2008)). While basically any activated class I PI3K can drive growth and proliferation, PI3K isoforms might also play distinct roles in the mod - ulation of host anti-tumor responses and angiogenesis. A better understanding of the role of PI3Ks in pro- and anti-tumoral responses contributes therefore to strate - gies to refine PI3K inhibitor profiles to be used in oncol - ogy. The use of a syngeneic BL16 cell melanoma mouse model has helped to actions of PI3K, PI3K , and PI3K . The loss of function of PI3K in the host, for example, protected tumor mice completely from the formation of lymph node metastasis. Interest - ingly, this correlates with the absence of mast cells even from normal lymph nodes. While roles for macrophages in tumor angiogenesis and tumor metastasis have been established, it is not clear how mast cell contribute to the colonization of lymph nodes by metastatic mela - noma. The investigation of tissue-specific genetically targeted mice, in vivo cellular complementation stud - ies, and immune-modulatory approaches are ongoing to unravel the cellular networks modulating melanoma dissemination. As a whole, we aim to elucidate lipid signaling in inflam - mation and cancer, and to provide novel insights to de - vise strategies for novel therapies. To expand our pos - sibilities, we have started some time ago to collaborate with chemists (E. Constable and B. Giese), to generate molecular tools to study signal transduction, and to modulate PI kinase activities. This work has already gen - erated several joint patent applications, and has helped to initiate a network founded by the European Science Foundation (ESF) with the aim to develop further mo - lecular probes to track phosphoinositide signaling in space and time. Matthias WymannFig. 4. Importance of PI3K signaling in host immune system and melanoma tumors. To evaluate the importance of PI3K signaling in the host immune system, BL16 melanoma cells were intradermally inoculated into the ear of genetically modified animals. Results obtained with wild type mice and mice expressing a catalytically inactive PI3K (knock-in mice, PI3K KI) are shown here. A, B) While wild type mice developed meta - static melanoma in cervical lymph nodes (LN), PI3K KI were largely protected against metastasis in lymph nodes. C) Metastatic tumors in wild type animals displayed high numbers of mast cells in the capsule of the lymph node (arrows point to mast cells). In PI3K KI animals, mast cells could not be detected in the lymph node of healthy and tumor bearing mice (Marone et al., unpub - lished).DBM Facts 2|2011 Department of BiomedicineINSTITUTE OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND GENETICS WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE 7 References 1.

USB Understanding glaucoma: intricate networks and amazing architecture The main goal behind the research in the lab \"Ocular Pharmacology and Physiology\" is to understand the pro - cesses leading to glaucoma - a quite common neurodegenerative disorder. We follow two lines of investigation: we study the amazing architecture of meningothelial cells and the environment they form around the optic nerve and we are also fascinated by the intricate networks formed by mitochondria and their connection to mitochondrial health and glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Figure 1: The group \"Ocular Pharmacology and Physiology\". From left to right and back to front: Roy Allenspach, Charles Hemion, Albert Neutzner, Anne-Sophie Benischke, Claudia Monique Missing from Department of BiomedicineDEPARTMENT OF BIOMED ICINE USB WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE 9 Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness and affects over 60 million patients worldwide. Clinically, this con - dition presents with a diminished field of vision and ultimately loss of sight, resulting from the slowly pro - gressing degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons making up the optic nerve. One hallmark of glau - coma that distinguishes this disease from other optic nerve disorders is the remodelling of the optic nerve head or excavation of the optic disc (see Figure 2). Due to the slow progression of the disease and the astonish - ing capabilities of the visual cortex to fill in missing vi - sual information (think: blind spot), patients oftentimes see a doctor only after the irreparable damage to the optic nerve has already occurred. Despite one century of intense research, the underlying cause for glauco - matous neurodegeneration is still debated. One major - and the most accepted - risk factor for glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure. However, elevated pres - sure does not inevitably cause glaucoma and lowering it using medication is not necessarily enough to halt the progression of the disease. Interestingly, so called normal tension glaucoma, where intraocular pressure is not elevated but rather remains normal, occurs in around 20% Caucasians and in about 90% of patients in the Asian population. Therefore, additional causes or factors for glaucoma pathogenesis are likely at play. Consequently, impaired ocular perfusion caused by vas - cular dysregulation is discussed as a second risk factor for glaucoma development. The eye and especially ret - ina and optic nerve are exquisitely oxygen-dependent tissues and therefore rely heavily on sufficient blood supply. Vasospasms as a consequence of vascular dys -regulation are thought to cause intermittent ischemia, thereby damaging retinal ganglion cells by ischemia-reperfusion injury.So it is safe to say, that there is still a fierce debate in the field of glaucoma research as to what the mecha - nisms causing or contributing to the development and progression of glaucomatous optic nerve damage are. The optic nerve microenvironment Most research into the causes for glaucomatous dam - age to the optic nerve is focused on processes taking place in the eye. However, the visual system and the damage caused by glaucoma extend well beyond the eye and include the optic nerve as well. As part of the brain, the optic nerve is enveloped by the meninges that a provide barrier function and protect the central nervous system. The meninges consist of three layers - the dura, arachnoid and pia mater. Meningothelial cells or MECs cover the meninges and thus form the in - terface between the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) and the rest of the body. The optic nerve sheath is anatomically a peculiar area. It is an extension of the CSF-filled col - umn around the brain matter formed like a cul-de-sac. This has certain implications for the flow of CSF and its renewal. It has long been known that the CSF does not only provide a cushion for the brain but that the CSF is also central in transporting nutrients, waste products and hormones and is also the site of immunological re - actions. Thus, CSF turnover is essential for its function with the choroid plexus producing around 500 ml of this special liquid, renewing the CSF three times daily. Due to the peculiar anatomy of the optic nerve microenvi - ronment, renewal of the CSF around the optic nerve fac - es particular problems. While CSF can freely enter this area, leaving this area is not possible through the same route. And indeed, lymphatic canals were found near the optic nerve implicated in CSF drainage. Now, clini - cal observations made in patients suffering from pap - illedema and normal tension glaucoma demonstrate a clear compartmentalization of the CSF around the optic nerve from the rest of the CSF volume associated with elevated pressure inside this compartment. Interesting - ly, fenestration of the optic nerve is able to release this build-up pressure and reverses the compartmentaliza - tion with patients experiencing improvement of their Figure 2: Glaucomatous damage. A funduscopic examination reveals a characteristic alteration of the papilla. Histological analysis illustrates the drastic loss of retinal ganglion cells and the tissue remodelling in the optic nerve head area. The post- mortem whole eye picture nicely demonstrates the so called cupping of the optic nerve head.DBM Facts 2|2011 Departement Biomedizin10 WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE DEPARTEMENT BIOMEDI ZIN USB visual defects. Considering the confinement of the op - tic nerve surroundings and the intricate architecture of MECs forming a maze of trabeculae and septae (Figure 3), one can easily imagine that tissue remodelling in this area can alter or obstruct the flow of CSF with poten - tial detrimental consequences for optic nerve function. Through the analysis of post-mortem optic nerves of glaucoma patients we found significant changes in the microenvironment of the optic nerve. And since MECs form this microenvironment, we focused our efforts on understanding MECs and their potential role in diseases of the optic nerve including glaucoma but also other neurodegenerative disorders.Although MECs seem to exert an important function in protecting the brain, these cells are barely studied and their interactions with the CSF compartment are mainly uncharted. To study MECs, we established a primary cell culture from porcine optic nerve sheaths we obtain fresh from the slaughterhouse in Basel. [Off note, these eyes are of the highest quality and find many uses in our laboratory and we are sure the remainder of these pigs have equally important (and delicious) applica - tions.] We also use MECs derived from an immortalized benign, human meningioma for our work. While study -ing MECs, we found that these cells react to elevated pressure. When we applied atmospheric pressure + 30 mmHg, MECs increased their proliferation by around 20 %. In addition, MECs seem to provide clearance func - tion for the CSF. MECs perform quite a lot of phagocyto - sis and pinocytosis; considering the huge area covered by these cells this might be a route for the removal of waste products. Interestingly, while elevated pres - sure caused increased proliferation of these cells, their phagocytotic activity was diminished by this treatment (Figure 4). Another culprit connected to neurodegen - erative disorders is oxidative stress. While MECs show high resistance to oxidative stress inducing agents in terms of viability, their ability to phagocytose is severely affected by such treatments.This lead us to propose a vicious circle of increased MEC proliferation leading to changes in the architecture of the optic nerve microenvironment causing altered CSF renewal which in turn puts additional stress on MECs and negatively affects their ability to phagocytose and perform their CSF clearing function. One can then imag - ine that not well maintained CSF might have a negative influence on optic nerve function.Recently, we also discovered a potential immunologi - cal function for MECs in the CSF. We found that MECs are active producers of cytokines in response to various stimuli associated with bacterial infection. In addition, their phagocytic and pinocytic activity was enhanced af - ter stimulation with lipopolysaccharide further support - ing a CSF clearing function for MECs.Future directions for our research into MECs will entail a more thorough analysis of MECs in terms of their bar - rier function in vivo using immunohistochemistry and Figure 3: Microenvironment of the optic nerve. Shown is an elec - tron microscopic picture of a cross section of an optic nerve. From the outside to the inside: dura mater, arachnoid mater (arrow), trabeculae and septae of the subarachnoid space (aster - isk) and pia mater surrounding the axon bundle forming the actual optic nerve.Figure 4: Elevated pressure affects MEC phagocytosis. Elevated (30 mmHg) and atmospheric pressure treated MECs were incu - bated with fluorescently labelled latex beads, fixed, DAPI stained and analyzed by microscopy. Bead uptake is significantly inhib - ited in MECs treated with elevated pressure compared to control cells.DBM Facts 2|2011 Department of BiomedicineDEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDI CINE USB WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE 11 human optic nerve samples as well as changes in MEC architecture in other diseases of the optic nerve associ - ated with the death of retinal ganglion cells. Mitochondrial health and neurodegeneration Despite all controversy about its aetiology - high and normal pressure, mechanistic and biochemical explana - tions, vascular dysregulation or optic nerve microenvi ronment - glaucoma is at the core a neurodegenerative disorder. The loss of vision is ultimately caused by the untimely death of retinal ganglion cells that form the optic nerve with their around one million axons. Cen - tral to most if not all neurodegenerative disorders is the involvement of mitochondria respectively their dys - function. Thus, we concentrate our efforts to better un - derstand how mitochondria are kept in shape and how dysfunctional mitochondria are connected to cell death and neurodegeneration especially during glaucoma. Mitochondria are multitaskers. They are involved in lipid metabolism, the production of iron-sulphur clus - ters, the storage of calcium ions and are executioners of programmed cell death, but first and foremost they are the major producer of ATP in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Due to the high energy demand of neuronal cells, neurons depend on oxidative phosphor - ylation and cannot rely on glycolysis alone to meet their ATP demands. This is especially true for the eye (Figure 5). Since these organelles handle oxygen, a quite toxic substance, oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA and proteins is quasi an occupational hazard. And damaged mitochondria are not only not efficient in ATP produc - tion but are also producers of potentially dangerous re - active oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide. Thus, mitochondria have to be maintained in order to keep cellular ATP levels high and to prevent excessive ROS production and therefore oxidative damage. Failure to do so might ultimately result in neurodegeneration. Maintaining mitochondria is a three tiered process (Fig - ure 6). At the molecular level, bacterial type proteases located in the matrix of mitochondria are responsible for the removal of oxidized proteins, while AAA prote - ases anchored in the inner mitochondrial membrane Figure 5: Mitochondrial distribution in the optic nerve. The mitochondrial marker COX IV was stained in a cross section of a human eye. Note the strong staining in the retina and the optic nerve head (*) compared to the remainder of the optic nerve. While the axons in the optic nerve are myelinated, due to space and optical restraints no myelin is present in the retina and the optic nerve head, thus causing high energy demand for signal propagation in the absence of nodes of Ranvier. Figure 6: Different proteolytic systems are active in the four mitochondrial compartments. Quality control in the matrix is performed by Lon and ClpX, proteins related to bacterial protea - ses dating back to the endosymbiotic event that formed modern eukaryotic cells some 1.5 billion years ago. The inner mitochon - drial membrane harbours AAA proteases facing the matrix (m-AAA) and the intermembrane space (i-AAA). Recent data from us and others point to a role of membrane-anchored RING finger ubiquitin ligases in the turnover of OMM proteins in a process we dubbed OMMAD for outer mitochondrial membrane associated degradation; a process that is related to ER associated degrada - tion (ERAD) responsible for quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum.12 WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE INSTITUTE OF Biomedizin12 WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE DEPARTEMENT BIOMEDI degrade IMM-localized membrane proteins. Ad - ditional mitochondrial quality control is performed through ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degrada - tion of proteins of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) by specialized OMM-localized ubiquitin ligases.The second tier of mitochondrial maintenance is at the organellar level. In a process termed mitophagy, entire, non-functional mitochondrial subunits are removed by autophagy. Interestingly, recent work revealed a role for the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, a gene mutated in familial Parkinson's disease, in the autophagic destruction of damaged, depolarized mitochondria. These findings provide another link between mitochondrial dysfunc - tion/quality control and neurodegenerative disorders. The third tier of mitochondrial maintenance takes place at the cellular level. Mitochondria are an integral part of the apoptotic machinery. The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) is the point of no-return for the induction of programmed cell death. Thus, extensive damage to the mitochondrial network causes apoptotic cell death removing an entire mitochondrial network in an ultimate quality control process. These three mechanisms are interdependent (Figure 7) and connected through regulators of mito - chondrial morphology (Figure 8).Unlike the classical textbook picture of rather small, un - interesting looking, bean shaped objects, mitochondria are very dynamic organelles and quite beautiful to look at (Figure 9). In fact, mitochondria form vast networks inside most cells that are shaped by constant ongoing fission and fusion of mitochondrial tubules. Recent ad - vances in the understanding of this process revealed this integrative role of mitochondrial morphology. Mi - tochondrial fission is an important part of the apoptotic program. During the release of cytochrome c from the IMS, mitochondria fragment and it was shown that the inhibition of this fragmentation inhibits the progres - sion of programmed cell death. And the opposite is true for mitochondrial fusion: interference with the fu - sion machinery sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli. On the other hand, proteins known for their pro-apoptotic function such as BAX and BAK are now acknowledged for their role in morphology regulation in healthy cells. Mitochondrial fragmentation does not only play a role in programmed cell death; during mitophagy, shorten - ing of mitochondria greatly aids the uptake of damaged Figure 7: The central role of mitochondrial morphology regula - tion. All three levels of control are influ - enced by mitochondrial morphology. In turn, the mitochondrial network adapts as well with the ultimate goal to keep the respiratory chain running efficiently and therefore to keep ATP production high. Figure 8: The mitochondrial fission and fusion machineries. Mitochondrial morphology is maintained by large GTPases (in green). Fission is performed by the dynamin-related Drp1 together with the docking factor Mff, while fusion of the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane is achieved by the mito - fusins (Mfn1 and Mfn2) and Opa1, respectively. Both processes are influenced by two novel mitochondrial ubiquitin ligases (in orange), MARCH5 and RTM9. For the microscopic images, cells were stained for the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c illus - trating (middle panel), frag - mented mitochondria due to deletion of a mitofusin (left panel) and highly interconnected mitochondria following knockdown of the fission protein Drp1 (right panel).INSTITUTE OF PHYSIOLOGY WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE DBM 2|2011 Department of BiomedicineDEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDI CINE USB WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE 13 autophagosomes. But changes in mito - chondrial morphology are also important for the repair of minor damage. Mixing of the matrix content of two mitochondrial tubules is thought to provide templates for mtDNA repair. And since mitochondrial fusion de - pends on the presence of a mitochondrial membrane potential in both partners, continuous fusion provides a means of weeding out damaged and depolarized mito - chondrial subunits. The central role of mitochondrial morphology is high - lighted by various diseases associated with mitochon - drial morphogens. Mutations in the fusion protein Opa1 cause dominant optic atrophy (DOA), the most common hereditary optic neuropathy. [In a genealogical side note, there is also a mitochondrial Oma1 (German for grandma 1), that is involved in the proteolytic process - ing of Opa1 (German for grandpa 1).] Another neuro - degenerative disorder associated with a mitochondrial morphogen is Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2A (CMT2A), where mutations in the mitofusin Mfn2 cause a peripheral neuropathy that is combined in some cases with an op - tic neuropathy and impaired hearing. Interestingly, no hereditary disease is associated with mutations of the central fission protein Drp1, however, a rare, lethal birth defect was reported that seemed to be caused by non-functional Drp1. While mutations in Drp1 seem to be mostly detrimental, MARCH5, a mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase and regulator of Drp1, was recently implicated in the degradation of mSOD1, connected to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and to the turnover of ataxin-3 polyQ, associated with Machado-Joseph disease. This further connects the mitochondrial fission machinery to neuro - degenerative processes much like it was shown for the fusion machinery before.Our work now focuses on the characterization of the mitochondrial ubiquitin ligases MARCH5 and RTM9 and their role in protein turnover and mitochondrial quality control. In addition, we employ an in vitro model of reti - nal ganglion cells (RGCs) to study the effect of modulat - ing mitochondrial morphology and protein turnover on the survival of RGCs. So far, we identified an important role for RTM9 in keeping mitochondria functional and in shape. In addition, we found that MARCH5 is involved in the mitochondrial morphology changes in RGCs in re - sponse to elevated pressure. While mitochondria frag -ment and thus most likely sensitize RGCs to apoptotic stimuli, inactivation of MARCH5 interferes with this pro - cess and might have a protective function.While there still remain many open questions regarding glaucoma, we hope that our integrative approach will lead to more insight into the aetiology of this blinding disease. Beyond that, insight into the molecular mech - anisms leading to glaucomatous neurodegeneration might prove useful for the understanding of other such diseases.

The PhD Club is a platform to for present and discuss ideas, open to all PhD students no matter whe-ther they are at the beginning or at the end of their thesis. Who doesn't get nervous and lose sleep before giving a first talk in front of a big audience? Although many students have had some experience presen-ting papers to fellow students during lecture at university, presenting one's own data means something different. Since the club is only open to students, the students are the experts, and as such, are responsible for generating and interpreting the data they present. The main benefit of the PhD Club is that it gives all PhD students the opportunity to share their data in a relaxed environment where they can discuss implications, ideas and problems. Moreover, they re - ceive helpful input from stu - dents with different specializa - tions and insight - shining light on the project from a different point of view. During undergraduate studies many students were accus -tomed to sitting in the lecture hall and waiting for informa - tion given by the professor at the front. Asking questions was embarrassing because the student worried that the ques - tion might be stupid, or that other students and possibly even the Professor might think the student is stupid. For the participants of the PhD club, we provide the opportunity to ask questions and to overcome self-doubt. Apart from presenting results and asking questions there are many other concerns that PhD students find themselves con - fronted with including but not limited to project mapping, time management, problem solving, literature searches and writing. These and many other things are also discussed in the PhD Club. Last, but not least, the Apero at the end of a presentation and the summer activities are a good opportunity to social net - work.

April 2011 schloss Daniel Meier von der Forschungsgruppe Diabetes Re- search hypertrophy involves growth responses to a vari- ety of stimuli triggered by increased workload. It is an independent risk factor for heart failure and sudden death. Mammalian target of rapa- mycin (mTOR) plays a key role in cellular growth responses by integrat - ing growth factor and energy status signals. It is found in 2 structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes called mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and mTORC2. The role of each of these branches of mTOR sig- naling in the adult heart is currently unknown. Methods and Results \u2014We generated mice with deficient myocardial mTORC1 activity by targeted ablation of raptor , which encodes an es- sential component of mTORC1, during adulthood. At 3 weeks after the deletion, atrial and brain natriuretic peptides and \u00df-myosin heavy chain were strongly induced, multiple genes involved in the regulation of en- ergy metabolism were altered, but cardiac function was normal. Function deteriorated rapidly afterward, resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy and high mortality within 6 weeks. Aortic banding-induced pathological over - load resulted in severe dilated cardiomyopathy already at 1 week without a prior phase of adaptive hypertrophy. The mechanism involved a lack of adaptive cardiomyocyte growth via blunted protein synthesis capacity, as supported by reduced phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase 1 and 4E-binding protein 1. In addition, reduced mitochondrial content, a shift in metabolic substrate use, and increased apoptosis and autophagy were observed. Conclusions \u2014Our results demonstrate an essential function for mTORC1 in the heart under physiological and pathological conditions and are relevant for the understanding of disease states in which the insulin/ insulin-like growth factor signaling axis is affected such as diabetes mel- litus and heart failure or Impairs Adaptive Hypertrophy, Alters Metabolic Thierry Pedrazzini, PhD; Marijke Brink, PhD From the Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland (P.S., I.P., C.M., F.Z., M.B.); Medical Research Foundation and Cardiology Division, University of Geneva and University Hospital Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland (C.P., R.L.); Cardiovas - cular Assessment Facility, University of Lausanne Medical School, Lausanne, Switzerland (C.B.); Department of Medicine, University of Lausanne Medical School, Lausanne, Switzerland (T.P.); ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland (J.K.); and Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel (M.N.H., M.A.R.), Switzerland.

DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICINE PUBLICATIONS 17 DBM Facts 2|2011 Department of BiomedicineAbstract: Therapy of chronic hepatitis C with pegylated interferon (pegIFN- ) and ribavirin achieves sustained virological responses in approximately half of the patients. Nonresponse to treatment is associated with constitutively increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes in the liver already before therapy. This activation of the endogenous IFN system could prevent cells from responding to therapeutically injected (peg)IFN- , because prolonged stimulation of cells with IFN- induces desensitization of the IFN signal transduction pathway. Whether all types of IFNs induce refrac - toriness in the liver is presently unknown. We therefore treated mice with multiple injections and different combinations of IFN-,IFN- ,IFN- ,and IFN-. Pretreatment of mice with IFN-,IFN- ,and IFN- induced a strong expression of the negative regulator ubiquitin-speci fic peptidase 18 in the liver and gut. As a result, IFN- signaling was signi ficantly reduced Hepatology 2011;53:1154-1163 IF Tough,2 and Markus H. Heim1,3 when mice where reinjected 16 hours after the first injection. Surpris - ingly, both IFN- and IFN- could activate the Janus kinase-signal trans - ducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway and the expression of IFN-stimulated genes despite high levels of ubiquitin-speci fic peptidase 18. IFN- treatment of human liver biopsies ex vivo resulted in strong and maintained phosphorylation of STAT1, whereas IFN-- induced STAT1 ac- tivation was transient. Conclusion: Contrary to the action of IFN-,IFN- ,and IFN- signaling in the liver does not become refractory during repeated stimulation of the IFN signal transduction pathway. The sustained efficacy of IFN- and IFN- could be an important advantage for the treatment patients who are nonresponders to pegIFN- , through a preactivated endogenous IFN system.Abstract: Background & Aims: The host immune response during the chronic phase of hepatitis C virus infection varies among individuals; some pa- tients have a no interferon (IFN) response in the liver, whereas others have full activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Preactivation of this endogenous and the IL28B (IFN 3) gene with treatmentre - sponse. We investigated whether IL28B genotype determines the con- stitutive expression of ISGs in the liver and compared the abilities of ISG levels and IL28B genotype to predict treatment outcome. Methods: We genotyped 109 patients with chronic hepatitis C for IL28B allelic variants and quantified the hepatic expression of ISGs and of IL28B . Decision tree ensembles, in the form of a random forest classifier, were used to calculate the relative predictive power of these different variables in a multivariate analysis.Gastroenterology 2011;140: 1021-1031 IF 12,8 Interferon-Induced Gene Expression Is a Stronger Predictor of Treatment Response Than IL28B Genotype in Patients With Hepatitis C Michael T. Dill,1,4 Fran\u00e7ois H. T. Duong,1 The minor IL28B allele was significantly associated with increased expression of ISG. However, stratification of the patients according to treatment response revealed increased ISG expression in nonresponders, irrespective of IL28B genotype. Multivariate analysis of ISG expression, IL28B genotype, and several other factors associated with response to therapy identified ISG expression as the best predictor of treatment re- sponse. Conclusions: IL28B genotype predictors of response to treatment with pegIFN- and ribavi - rin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The most accurate prediction of response was obtained with a 4-gene classifier comprising IFI27, ISG15, RSAD2, and HTATIP2.

Neurology 2011;76:1206-1213 IF 8,1 Abstract: Objective: Neurodegeneration is now accepted as a pathologic hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS). We sought to discover whether CSF levels of neurofilament heavy chain protein (NfH SMI35) correlate with disability, dis- ease activity, or specific stages of MS. Methods: An electrochemiluminescence immunoassay was used to ret- rospectively measure NfHSMI35 in CSF of patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) (n = 63), relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) (n = 39), secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) (n = 25), primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) (n = 23), or controls (n = 73). Cell count and CSF levels of immunoglobulin and albumin were also mea- sured. Results: CSF levels of NfHSMI35 increased with age in controls (rs = 0.50, p < 0.0001) and CIS (rs = 0.50, p < 0.0001); this effect was less pronounced in RRMS (rs = 0.35, p = 0.027) and absent in SPMS/PPMS. After age cor- rection, NfHSMI35 levels were found to be higher in all disease stages com - pared to control. Relapses were associated with higher CSF NfHSMI35 values compared with stable disease. NfHSMI35 levels correlated with EDSS scores in patients with CIS and RRMS (rs = 0.33, p = 0.001), and during relapse (rs = 0.35, p = 0.01); the correlation was most prominent in RRMS during relapse (rs = 0.54, p = 0.01). This was not the case for any of the other CSF markers examined. Conclusions: Neuronal loss is a feature of aging, and the age-dependent increase of CSF NfHSMI35 suggests that this loss accelerates over time. For MS, increased NfHSMI35 levels reflect the superimposed presence of further neurodegenerative processes. Evaluation of NfHSMI35 levels is likely to pro- vide a useful surrogate for measuring the rate of neurodegeneration in MS. Furthermore, the dissociation of NfHSMI35 levels with biomarkers of in- flammation suggests that the mechanisms responsible for their produc - tion are at least partly independent.Neurofilament heavy chain in CSF correlates with relapses and disability in multiple sclerosis J.

DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICINE PUBLICATIONS 19 DBM Facts 2|2011 Department of BiomedicineSummary The essential roles of SHH in anteroposterior (AP) and AER-FGF signalling in proximodistal (PD) limb bud development are well understood. In ad- dition, these morphoregulatory signals are key components of the self- regulatory SHH/GREM1/AER-FGF feedback signalling system that regu - lates distal progression of limb bud development. This study uncovers an additional signalling module required for coordinated progression of limb bud axis development. Transcriptome analysis using Shh-deficient mouse limb buds revealed that the expression of proximal genes was distally extended from early stages onwards, which pointed to a more prominent involvement of SHH in PD limb axis development. In particu - lar, retinoic acid (RA) target genes were upregulated proximally, while the expression of the RA-inactivating Cyp26b1 enzyme was downregulated distally, pointing to increased RA activity in Shh-deficient mouse limb buds. Further genetic and molecular analysis established that Cyp26b1 expression is regulated by AER-FGF signalling. During initiation of limb bud outgrowth, the activation of Cyp26b1 expression creates a distal 'RA-free' domain, as indicated by complementary downregulation of a transcriptional sensor of RA activity. Subsequently, Cyp26b1 expression increases as a consequence of SHH-dependent upregulation of AER-FGF signalling. To better understand the underlying signalling interactions, computational simulations of the spatiotemporal expression patterns and interactions were generated. These simulations predicted the exis- tence of an antagonistic AER-FGF/CYP26B1/RA signalling module, which was verified experimentally. In summary, SHH promotes distal progres - sion of limb development by enhancing CYP26B1-mediated RA clearance as part of a signalling network linking the SHH/GREM1/AER-FGF feedback loop to the newly identified AER-FGF/CYP26B1/RA module.Development 138,1913-1923 (2011) IF 7,1 Abstract: Rippling muscle disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding caveolin-3 (CAV3), the muscle-specific isoform of the scaffolding pro- tein caveo-lin, a protein involved in the formation of caveolae. In healthy muscle, caveolin-3 is responsible for the forma-tion of caveolae, which are highly organized sarcolemmal clusters influencing early muscle dif- ferentiation, signalling and Ca 2+ homeostasis. In the present study we examined Ca2+ homeostasis and excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in cultured myotubes derived from two patients with Rippling muscle disease with severe reduction in caveolin-3 expression; one patient har- boured the heterozygous c.84C>A mutation other patient a homozygous splice-site mutation (c.102+ 2T>C) affecting the splice donor site of intron 1 of the CAV3 gene. Our results show that cells from control and rippling muscle disease patients had similar rest- ing [Ca2+]i and 4-chloro- m-cresol-induced Ca2+ release but reduced KCl- induced influx. Detailed analysis of the voltage-dependence of Ca2+ transients revealed a significant shift of Ca2+ release activation to higher depolarization levels in CAV3 mutated cells. High resolution immuno fluo- rescence analysis by Total Internal Fluorescence microscopy supports the hypothesis that loss of caveolin-3 leads to microscopic disarrays in the colocalization of the voltage-sensing dihydropyridine receptor and the ryanodine receptor, thereby reducing the efficiency of excitation-con - traction coupling.

Hes1, a bHLH transcriptional repressor, in- fluences progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Recently, Hes1 was shown to be expressed in the thyroid and regulate expression of the sodium iodide symporter (Nis). To investigate the role of Hes1 for thyroid development, we studied thyroid morphology and function in mice lack- ing Hes1 . During normal mouse thyroid development, Hes1 was detected from E9.5 onwards in the median anlage, and at E11.5 in the ultimobran - chial bodies. Hes1-/- mouse embryos had a significantly lower number of Nkx2-1-positive progenitor cells (p,0.05) at E9.5 and at E11.5. Moreover, Hes12/2 mouse embryos showed a significantly smaller total thyroid surface area (-40 to -60%) compared to wild type mice at all study time points (E9.52-E16.5). In both Hes1-/- and wild type mouse embryos, most Nkx2-1-positive thyroid cells expressed the cell cycle inhibitor p57 at E9.5 in correlation with low proliferation index. In Hes1-/- mouse embryos, fu- sion of the median anlage with the ultimobranchial bodies was delayed by 3 days (E16.5 vs. E13.5 in wild type mice). After fusion of thyroid anla- ges, hypoplastic Hes1-/- thyroids revealed a significantly decreased label - ling area for T4 (-78%) and calcitonin (-65%) normalized to Nkx2-1 posi- tive cells. Decreased T4-synthesis might be due to reduced Nis labelling area (-69%). These findings suggest a dual role of Hes1 during thyroid development: first, control of the number of both thyrocyte and C-cell progenitors, via a p57-independent second, endocrine function and C-cells. Hes1 Is Required for Appropriate Morphogenesis and during analysis mouse revealed that GREMLIN1 (GREM1)-mediated antagonism of BMP4 is essential for ureteric epithelial branching as the disruption of ureteric bud outgrowth and renal agenesis in Grem1 -deficient embryos is restored by additional inactivation of one Bmp4 allele. Another BMP ligand, BMP7, was shown to control the pro- liferative expansion of nephrogenic progenitors and its requirement for nephrogenesis can be genetically substituted by Bmp4 . Therefore, we in- vestigated whether BMP7 in turn also participates in inhibiting ureteric bud outgrowth during the initiation of metanephric kidney development. Methodology/Principal Findings: Genetic inactivation of one Bmp7 allele in Grem1 -deficient mouse embryos does not alleviate the bilateral renal agenesis, while complete inactivation of Bmp7 restores ureteric bud outgrowth and branching. In mouse embryos lacking both Grem1 and Bmp7 , GDNF/WNT11 feedback signaling and the expression of the Etv4 target gene, which regulates formation of the invading ureteric bud tip, are restored. In contrast to the restoration of ureteric bud outgrowth and branching, nephrogenesis remains aberrant as revealed by the premature loss of Six2 expressing nephrogenic progenitor cells. Therefore, very few nephrons develop in kidneys lacking both Grem1 and Bmp7 and the re- sulting dysplastic phenotype is indistinguishable from the one of Bmp7 - deficient mouse embryos. Conclusions/Significance: Our study reveals an unexpected inhibitory role of BMP7 during the onset of ureteric bud outgrowth. As BMP4, BMP7 and GREM1 are expressed in distinct mesenchymal and epithelial do- mains, the localized antagonistic interactions of GREM1 with BMPs could restrict and guide ureteric bud outgrowth and branching. The robustness and likely significant redundancy of the underlying signaling system is ev- idenced by the fact that global reduction of Bmp4 or inactivation of Bmp7 are both able to restore ureteric bud outgrowth and epithelial branching in Grem1 -deficient mouse embryos.

To assure optimal performance, target sequences should be regular - ly updated according to newly available sequences. The aim of this study was to review our in-house polyomavirus BK (BKV) and JC (JCV) real-time PCR assays. Database analysis revealed variations in the BKV target region which might affect the assay performance, while no signi ficant changes were found in the JCV target region. We compared two degenerate ver- sions of our BKV primers which accommodated at least 95% of all pub-lished genetic variants. Dilutions of cloned viral genomic DNA and probit analysis indicated an analytical sensitivity of the updated BKV assay of 4.15 copies/reaction and that was 3.37 speci ficity was testing JCV-and BKV-positive samples that showed no cross-reactivity. The performance of the original and updated BKV assay was compared in 101 urine and 200 plasma samples submitted to our routine diagnostic laboratory revealed similar quantitative results. We conclude that our JCV and updated BKV real-time PCR assays are ro- bust and detect rare variants possibly encountered in the clinical routine.Reevaluating and Optimizing Polyomavirus BK and JC Real-Time PCR Assays To Detect Rare Sequence Polymorphisms A. Dumoulin1 and H. H. Hirsch1,2 Abstract: GABA B receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors for -aminobutyric acid (GABA). KCTD8, 12, 12b, and 16 were recently identified as auxiliary GABAB receptor subunits and distinctly influence biophysical and phar - macological properties of the receptor response. Here we examined the expression patterns of the KCTDs in the mouse brain. Using in situ hybrid - ization analysis, we found that most neurons express KCTD transcripts, supporting biochemical data showing that most GABAB receptors in the brain incorporate KCTD proteins. In the adult brain, KCTD12 and 16 have a widespread and KCTD8 and 12b a restricted expression pattern. Indi- vidual neurons can coexpress multiple KCTDs, as shown for granule cells and CA1/CA3 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus that KCTD12 and 16.

The expression levels of individual KCTD transcripts vary during postnatal brain development. Immunohis - tochemistry reveals that individual KCTD proteins can exhibit distinct axonal or dendritic localizations in neuronal populations. KCTDs are also detectable in nonneuronal tissues not expected to express GABAB recep - tors, suggesting that the role of KCTD proteins extends beyond GABAB receptors. In summary, our findings support that most brain GABAB re- ceptors associate with KCTD proteins, but that the repertoire and abun - dance of KCTDs varies during development, among brain areas, neuronal populations, and at subcellular sites. We propose that the distinct spatial and temporal KCTD distribution patterns underlie functional differences in native GABAB responses.1 Transplantation Virology and Division of Diagnostics, Institute for Medical Microbiology, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland 2 Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland 1 Department of Biomedicine, Institute of Physiology, University of Basel, 4056 Basel, Switzerland 2 Institute of Physiologie II, University of Freiburg, 79108 Freiburg, Germany 3 Center for Biological Signaling Studies (bioss), 79104 Freiburg, Germany 4 Department of Biomedicine, Neurobiology Laboratory, University Hospital Basel, 4031 Basel, SwitzerlandJournal of Clinical Microbiology AMERICAN SOCIETY FORMICROBIOLOGYDEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICINE PUBLICATIONS 23 DBM Facts 2|2011 Department of phenotypic HIV resistance testing (rPRT) uses recombinant infectious virus to measure viral replication in the presence of antiretroviral drugs. Due to its high sensitivity of detection of viral mi- norities and its dissecting power for complex viral resistance patterns and mixed virus populations rPRT might help to improve HIV resistance diag- nostics, particularly for patients with multiple drug failures. The aim was to investigate whether the addition of rPRT to genotypic resistance test- ing (GRT) compared to GRT alone is beneficial for obtaining a virological response in heavily pre-treated HIV-infected patients. Methods: Patients with resistance tests between 2002 and 2006 were followed within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). We assessed patients' virological success after their antiretroviral therapy was switched follow - ing resistance testing. Multilevel logistic regression models with SHCS centre as a random effect were used to investigate the association be- tween the type of resistance test and virological response (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL or 1.5log reduction). Results: Of 1158 individuals with resistance tests 221 with GRT+rPRT and 937 with GRT were eligible for analysis. Overall virological response rates were 85.1% for GRT+rPRT and 81.4% for GRT. In the subgroup of patients with >2 previous failures, the odds ratio (OR) for virological response of GRT+rPRT compared to GRT was 1.45 (95% CI 1.00-2.09). Multivariate analyses indicate a significant improvement with GRT+rPRT compared to GRT alone (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.31-2.15). In heavily pre-treated patients rPRT-based resistance infor - mation adds benefit, contributing to a higher rate of treatment success.

Phosphoinositide lipids have garnered in-creased interest in the last two decades because of their importance in physiology and disease. Phos - phoinositides consist of an inositol ring head group, which is linked at po- sition 1 via a phosphodiester to a diacylglycerol portion. The inositol head group is dynamically phosphorylated at positions 3, 4 and/or 5 by phos - phoinositide kinases. Traditional detection methods are tedious, involve metabolic labeling and only provide information on the phosphoinositide head group but not on the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the diacylglycerol part. In this issue Clark et al. combine two approaches to improve detection efficiency and sensitivity. The field of phosphoinositide signaling gained momentum when scien - tists realized in the early 1980s that phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphos - phate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) could be cleaved by phospholipase (1,4,5) trisphosphate, triggering release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and diacylglycerol, activating protein kinase C. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was then discovered in 1988 (ref. 2) and established as the product of class I phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and as a key signaling lipid in many bio- logical and disease processes. In most studies PI3K activity has been monitored indirectly using anti- bodies to the phosphorylated form of its downstream effector protein kinase B (Akt, also known as PKB). Two findings increased the danger that phosphorylated PKB is not a specific readout for class I PI3K: (i) commonly used PI3K inhibitors target all PI3K family members including PI3K-related kinases, and (ii) one of these, namely mTOR kinase, also phosphorylates Akt/PKB on one of the same residues. In spite of this, the simplicity of immunological detection made it very popular.Neutral not a loss: phosphoinositides beyond the head group Matthias P Wymann1, Markus R Wenk21 Division of Infectious Diseases & Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland. 2 Basel Institute for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland. 3 InPheno AG, Vesalgasse 1, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland. 4 Department of Biomedicine, Institute for Medical Microbiology, University of Basel, Switzerland. 5 Division of Infectious Diseases & Hospital Epidemiology, Univ.

In 1972, equipped with a Bachelor's degree, I abandoned all that was familiar and settled my roots in Switzerland taking up a position as a Medical Technologist in the Chemistry laboratory of Kantons - spital Liestal where I worked un - til 1988 in between marrying and starting my family.

In 1997 I joined the University Women's Hospital, Basel as a Re - search Technician in the Labora - tory for Prenatal Medicine where I still work today. I have contributed significantly to furthering research in the above laboratories, with my main focus being towards extraction of plas - ma and serum from blood, isola - tion of DNA and RNA from plasma and serum, immunohistochemis - try, fluorescence in-situ hybridiza - tion (FISH), enrichment of rare fetal hemopoietic cells from the circula - tion of pregnant women using the magnetic cell sorting method (pat - ented by the Laboratory for Prena - tal Medicine). I also regularly train many research students and for - eign students of at least 8 different nationalities. As the years went by, I ensured Ma - harlika became increasingly active in organizing and financing deve- lopment and charity projects in the Philippines. We were able to raise over 5 million Philippine Pesos in support of many projects includ - ing funding construction of school buildings across the Philippines, day care centres for special chil - dren, multi-purpose halls, concre-ting roadways and improvement of facilities, setting up feeding programs and we were featured in many Basel based newspapers as well as receiving the Presidential Despite my many successes, the plight of the Filipinos, especially the migrant workers, was always close to my heart. Wanting to give something back to my home country, in 1995 I joined Maharlika-Switzerland, a Filipino organiza - tion with a two-fold purpose, to help Filipino migrants across Swit - zerland to preserve their Filipino culture as well as to increase Swiss and foreigner's awareness of Filipi - no customs and traditions through various festivities and events. On the other side I wanted to help the Filipinos through the initially daunting matrix of the Swiss sys - tem, by providing them informa - tion and imparting knowledge through workshops and talks on the Swiss pension system, health, German language lessons, team-building, and counselling.

Juggling full-time work in the lab, raising children, and helping Fili - pinos took over the most part of my life so that there were never enough hours in the day to even begin a hobby. Now that my son Stefan, daughter Sharon are married with children, and my other daughter Nicole is working full-time as a teacher, I feel I can finally take my first break in 40 years to take up my passions in life for travelling with my hus - band, recently returning from a pil - grimage to India where I got to pay homage to another passion, my religious beliefs. My time is divided between being a grandmother to my 1 year old grandson and 2.5 year old granddaughter, cooking and tasting international cuisines, spending time gardening while still working hard to help various charity projects in the Philippines as well as offering counselling and advice here in Switzerland. Today, I feel I have accomplished all that I could hope for. Home for the abandoned old people, Montalban, Philippines What Vivian didn't say: In addition to the projects mentioned above Vivian was able to personally do the following projects with her husband: Philippines: gave financial help to home for the aged; distributed rice and canned goods to 800 to 1000 families every two years; helped addicted children (street children), gave financial help to rehabilitation; gave counselling (marriage, financial); assisted Filipinos in finding jobs.Iran: supported cancer patients and underprivileged families financially Egypt: supported cancer patients financially India: gave financial help to mentally retarded children and school children, gave financial help to 1000 to 1500 malnourished people every last Thursday of the month.
