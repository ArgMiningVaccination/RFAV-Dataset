Treat each audience segment uniquely to ascertain any ethnic nuances for messaging.4 METHODOLOGY METHODOLOGY 5 PHASE 1:Focus session participant configuration:Adult residents of Tennessee with demographic configuration of:Male/female mix (natural fallout)White (75 participants)Black/African American (natural fallout) Mean: $50k-$75kGeography: represented urban, and rural areas of the stateNumber of participants: 96Platform:Utilized a bulletin board format with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) to have a real-time conversation at scale with residents, across any device, anywhere they were. The tool allowed us to organize the participants into custom segments. Analyze the data to better understand who they are, and what they know/believe/want. We received answers straight from the people who matter most -all specifically residents of Tennessee. 6 EXECUTIVE SUMMARYOBSERVATIONS & KEY THEMES TO CARRY ON TO PHASE 2 (QUANTITATIVE)7EXECUTIVE SUMMARYObservationsWhen asked their willingness to be vaccinated, the greatest roadblock is with rural, conservative Whites. The Black population is basically willing but not yet ready or need a little more assurance and the Hispanic/Latino population is waiting to get an appointment or need a little more assurance.

Not entirely safe when some people have negative side effects, or some have diedfrom it. Not fully tested either since there are not enough testing results.I'm not entirely sure it would be wise for me to take the vaccine. Not entirely safe when some people have negative side effects, or some have diedfrom it. Not fully tested either since there are not enough testing results.I do not trust most vaccines especially one that has not really been tested for some time. Long term effects ETC...I am not sureof the necessity nor of the safetyI don't know if I want to get itI want to see how others are affected firstI don't think there has been enough research. You can't safely say that over time there won't be side effects when there hasn't been enough time to know. And my entire family has been exposed a couple times and nobody ever got sick.I don't think it is safeI want to see how others are affected firstHonestly and personally, I just don't believe in vaccinations and medicine. Whenever I become ill, I just push myself to be active until I heal.I am not sure of the necessity nor of the safetyI made it the entire time without symptom one. Why would I put something in my body to prevent a thing I'm not worried about?Honestly and personally, I just don't believe in vaccinations and medicine. Whenever I become ill, I just push myself to be active until I heal.I am very willing to get the vaccine so I can go to classes in person at my university and so I don't have to wear masks anymore in public, but I need a bit more preparation before I take it. I want to know which vaccine is the best to take out of the three.I don't think the trials were long enough to get effective results. I have also heard many stories of people dying or contacting COVID again after taking the vaccineI feel the vaccine was rushed to get out. They have been trying for years to create a covid/sars vaccine and have been unsuccessful. There hasn't been enough testing done to see what the long-term effects may be.I am very willing to get the vaccine so I can go to classes in person at my university and so I don't have to wear masks anymore in public, but I need a bit more preparation before I take it. I want to know which vaccine is the best to takeI would like for kids to have it first in order forme to know its safeI feel like the studies were very rushed and I am unsure of the safety and effectiveness of them. I also have a health condition that prevents me from getting the flu vaccine so I am unsure how my body could react.There are to many conflicting reports and the deaths already associated with it are a little concerning9EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ObservationsThe top perceived risks of getting vaccinated all revolve around the unknown -specifically around possible side effects immediately and in the future. Hispanic/Latino BlackUrban, Suburban, BlackWhiteRural, Conservative, WhiteAllThat's the thing, long term we have no idea. Short term I've read on death's, blood clots, etc.You can experience mild adverse side effects just from getting the shot alone but those are mostly accounted for. In extreme cases though, you could have extremely bad reactions that can threaten your life if the vaccine wasn't properly testedYou can experience mild adverse side effects just from getting the shot alone but those are mostly accounted for. In extreme cases though, you could have extremely bad reactions that can threaten your life if the vaccine wasn't properly testedUncertainty of immediate & long-term effects.Becoming severely ill from a reaction to the vaccine and not recovering from itUncertainty of immediate & long-term effects.Similar but less symptoms of actually havingcovid, I believe.

I always am affected by these things, so it is a risk to me that I do not want to take.Possibility of unintended side effectsthat occur after time has passed that no one is aware of because the vaccine is so new. Complications with other medical issues or medications.The risk of passing away and no one to care for my childThe risk of passing away and no one to care for my childUnknown long term side effectsFor FDA approval of a vaccine, it takes years of testing to see what the long-term effects are. These vaccines only have emergency use only. SoI just don't care to be the guinea pig being tested to see what the side effects will be.Unknown long term side effects10EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ObservationsFor those stating a fear of death, we ask which they are more afraid of?Hispanic/LatinoBlack Urban, Suburban, BlackWhite Rural, Conservative, WhiteAll Death by COVID0%43%50%42%33%41%Death by vaccine100%57%50%58%67%59% General ThemesI'm afraid of unknown things going into my bodyI am afraid of what they put into the vaccine. It hasn't been out long enough. It was rushedEither way you contact it, it could be death, but the vaccine might be a bit saferThe covid death rate is know, the vaccine is not known11EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ObservationsWhen asked about trust and preference of each of the three vaccines there was no real preference or trust associated with the vaccines across all groups. The most common response was \"I trust none of them.\" When asked if there was a preference they indicated: No preference, don't want any of them70% Which they trust the mostHispanic/LatinoBlackWhiteTotalNone20%17%54%47%Johnson & Johnson20%33%5%15%Any of them-9%14%15%Pfizer60%17%10%11%Moderna and Pfizer equally-7%9%8%Moderna-17%8%4%12EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ObservationsSocial pressure also is not playing a role in their decision. Only a few suggested that pressure was coming from their place of employment.In relation to where they get information that they can rely on about a vaccine, the top answers across the board were:1.Personal observation, scientifically proven facts, people's experiences, doctor's opinion, newsand friends2.CDC3.Don't seek information4.Social media (friends or peer groups/like-minded people) 13EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ObservationsIf more of your friends and family received the vaccine, how do you believe that would influence your decision on vaccination? (In rank order)1.It wouldn't2.Possibly for the better3.No4.It would not influence my decision.5.No. I make my own decisions.6.I would feel more confident receiving the vaccine.7.It wouldn't influence my decision, but I would be concerned for them and the possible long-term side effects they might experience someday.8.No, I am my own person and do not play into peer pressure9.My family has already received it but none of my friends. I have my own opinion and they cannot sway me either way. I'm not getting it for now. 14EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ObservationsWhen considering who -person, people or institution(s) -they trust to provide reliable vaccine information there was no firm answer except a total lack of trust.-Black and Hispanic populations would lean into family and those in the medical field they might trust to be knowledgeable and aware of what the vaccines can do. Possibly their physician.-The white respondents for the most part claim to trust NO ONE! Those that do trust would likely listen to their physician, pharmacist, CDC and independent review boardsOf those who indicated they would trust a medical professional, most indicated they have not spoken to their physician about the vaccine.-\"No, I have no desire to.\"-\"No, because they wouldn't tell me anything I don't already know.\"-\"No, because it's still new.\"-\"No, because I'm not interested in taking the vaccine.\" 15EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ObservationsOnly 25% believe that if enough people get vaccinated it will create herd immunity.There are basically no words being used today that would empower vaccination. It will take acceptable proof and an understanding/acceptance of current research technology that all is safe with the vaccine. Short of that it will be the assurance that comes after complete approval (not emergency approval) and \"years of research to document success.\" In consideration of time to feel confident in the vaccine it all boils down to time...\"5-10 years maybe. But I still wouldn't get it because COVID most likely wouldn't harm me any more than the flu anyway.\"Given four different phrases that might unleash a positive motivating response, the only one that showed any promise was to appeal to a family love emotional trigger.\"For the health of your loved ones.\" 36%\"Sowe can all get back to normal.\"18%\"It will open up the economy faster with sustainability.\" 12%\"Because it's everyone's responsibility.\"12%None of the above62% (80% of rural conservative whites)16EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ObservationsFamily and friends simply being vaccinated appears to have little or no influence in the decision to vaccinate.In response to their trust in the clergy to encourage vaccination the encouragement would fall on deaf ears. Surprisingly, they claimed it would have no impact.Given what we have learned so far, those that are unwilling will largely remain so. They need to hear, with certainty, what the data shows, and current scientific methods support safety for humans. 17EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KEY TAKEAWAYSThe primary concern is the speed and haste with which the vaccines were tested and developed.White, conservative rural Tennesseans are the least willing to accept the vaccine and seem to have planted their heels in the sand.Lack of compelling information/data to unseat disbelief.High level of skepticism on messaging about the vaccine from even traditional reliable resources.Community-based medical professionals have the highest degree of acceptance but are not currently being tapped for information.Those unwilling basically fear the unknown and skeptical of those with an underlying agenda.Those that are willing but hesitant may just need to be nurtured with information and social testimony. 18WHAT'S NEXT?

Phase 2 -QUANTITATIVE STUDYUsing what we have learned in the qualitative phase we conducted an online quantitative study. The participant configuration:-Adult residents of Tennessee with demographic mix of:Male/Female mix (natural fallout)Age: 18+ (natural fallout)Are unwilling or hesitant field April 1 -April 7Activity includes:-Developed the survey instrument / Secure participant panel -Results yield a confidence level of 95% for the overall sample with an error rate of \u00b13.-Data tabulation, Summarization, Analysis and a report of the findings from both the qualitative and quantitative learnings6 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY7EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KEY FINDINGSThe strongest position of unwilling/no interest is most pronounced with the white population. Black and Hispanic are more willing but hesitant.As is consistent with findings in other studies, white/rural/conservatives represent the most pronounced unwilling/no interest segment of the population.The willing but hesitant group has attained a higher level of education than the unwilling/no interest group.As a point of reference, there is an inherent predisposition of not getting vaccines. 45% of the respondents do not get an annual flu shot. That number rises to 52% for white/rural/conservatives and 63% for all those unwilling/no interest. 8EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KEY FINDINGSTop reasons for hesitancy:1.We don't know the long-term effects.2.I think they were developed too fast, so I don't trust them.3.I don't think there is enough scientific research to convince me that they are safe and effective.4.I don't know if they really work.-The reasons boil down to a lack of consistent, believable messaging around vaccine development and testing facts. And they haven't been delivered by trusted sources.Supporting that position, 46% to 64% are just unsure of vaccine safety.-Not sure:Black:46%White49%Hispanic64% 9EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KEY FINDINGSOf those unwilling/no interest, only 14% fear death from COVID while 35% fear death from a COVID vaccine. Additionally, 51% don't fear death from either. With the willing but hesitant, 52% fear death from COVID and only 17% fear death from a vaccine.White, and especially white/rural/conservatives have the lowest fear of death from either. They're just not overly concerned about the illness or the need for the vaccine.Most trusted sources of information (Top 6):1.Personal physician (except Black who rank it 4th)2.Hospital physician/Medical staff3.Family member4.Local physician (except Black & Hispanic who rank at 7 & 8 respectively)5.CDC (except white/rural/conservative and all Unwilling at 11 & 10 respectively)6.Pharmacist-Leverage the power of the personal physician or other local physician. With the Black audience, leverage the CDC. 10EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KEY FINDINGSLean into messaging which allows people to believe that 1) getting vaccinated will prevent more people from getting sick and help save lives and 2) will restore livelihoods so we can 3) restore normal life faster. (note: the unwilling/no interest will be the least responsive, but the hesitant will accept that messaging) Add to that -among all segments -messages that build confidence in getting a COVID vaccine by allowing them to hear:1.Most people who receive a vaccine have no side effects at all AND there is medically assured safety. (this is the most significant confidence builder)2.Every study, every phase and every trial was carefully reviewed by the FDA.3.You CANNOT get COVID-19 from the vaccine. 11EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KEY FINDINGSIn messaging use the acknowledge their skepticism.Additionally, 49% to 58% (all groups) would be most willing to take the vaccine for;-Their family-And up to 34% saying they would take it for themselves\"DO IT FOR YOUR FAMILY. DO IT FOR YOURSELF.\" 12EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KEY FINDINGSPreferred physicians and medical staff (physicians/nurse practitioners/physician assistants/nurses) are the faces and voices that MUST deliver a sincere emotional appeal. An appeal to love of family and love of self to compel action to get a COVID vaccine.-Deliver the warmth of the emotional appeal (not sappy) while lifting the solid facts of testing (even the length of time that has gone in to developing the type of vaccines that have been in development) by scientific medical experts. Need to overcome the fear of the unknown associated with the speed to delivery of the vaccine which has created a sense of skepticism related to long-term effects.-Consider a separate appeal for the Black audience with a credible voice (medical researcher or scientist -not physician or perceived politician) from the CDC-Messages cannot be heavy-handed. They must be sincere and from sources of integrity.-Help the media change the narrative by offering solid, believable information about the vaccines and their safety. 14 DATA 15DATAThere is an inherent predisposition of not getting vaccines. 45% of the respondents do not get an annual flu shot.
