Here we explore the best ways to help avoid catching the flu and how to help support your immune system this flu season. How can I protect myself from getting the flu? Flu can spread easily from person to person through coughs and sneezes, so it's best to keep away from anyone who has symptoms of the flu if you can. Flu germs can live on surfaces (including hands) for up to 24 hours, so make sure you practise good hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. It can also be helpful to carry a [hand sanitiser gel](https://www.boots.com/sitesearch?searchTerm=hand%20gel), for when you're out and about or without access to soap and water. As well as regular hand washing, it's a good idea to regularly clean and disinfect surfaces around your home such as light switches, door handles and remote controls. If you have flu symptoms, you can avoid passing germs on to other people by staying at home if you feel unwell, as well as covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and throwing used tissues in the bin as soon as you can. What are the best vitamins for my immune system? Keeping your immune system as strong and healthy as possible is the best way to help your body fight off any bugs you might come into contact with. Eating a varied, balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables is one of the best ways to help support your immune system. Zinc contributes to the normal function of the immune system. Meat, fish and seafood are all excellent sources of zinc, as well as brown rice and dairy products, and you can also take [zinc as a supplement](https://www.boots.com/wellness/vitaminsandsupplements/vitamins-supplements-shop-by-ingredient/zinc). Vitamins C and D also help support the normal function of the immune system. Citrus fruits, peppers, strawberries and tomatoes are all great sources of vitamin C, so be sure to include some of these in your diet if you can. You could also consider taking a daily [multivitamin](https://www.boots.com/health-pharmacy/covid-19-information-products-and-testing/multivitamins) or vitamin C supplement, as vitamin C taken in this form can also help support your immune system. Your body makes vitamin D through exposure to sunlight, however it's a good idea to take [a daily supplement providing 10mcg of vitamin D](https://www.boots.com/wellness/vitaminsandsupplements/vitamins-supplements-shop-by-ingredient/vitamin-D) to help support this, especially through the autumn and winter months when the sun doesn't say hello quite so often!
