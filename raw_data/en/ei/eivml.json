A second series took a similar look at Latinos and led to a companion book. O ne of the shining stars of television news, Soledad O'Brien has covered Hurricane Katrina, the South Asian tsunami, and breaking news in the war in Iraq and across the country. O'B rien anchored and reported a highly acclaimed documentary featuring a never-before- seen look at Martin Luther King Jr.'s private writings, notes, and teachings, which represent the foundation of his life's work as a preacher and human rights activist.

Stauffer, PhD Since loss is connected with many life experiences (e.g., death of a significant other, career reversals and disappointments, relationship endings, moving, changes in health status, aging, absence of expected life experiences), there are many circumstances in which counselors and therapists are called upon to assist clients with the bereavement process. Learn guidelines and techniques related to working through loss issues. A varied, experiential format will be utilized. 11002 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 203-204 What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger ... or Does It? Tools for Fostering Real Resilience in Children, Adults, and Ourselves Steve K. D. Eichel, PhD, Richard Craig Williams, PhD, James Walsh, PhD Counseling for resilience involves using a strength-based model rather than a deficit-based one. We define psychological well-being as a function of an individual's repertoire of behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. The goal of resilience-based counseling is to increase the repertoire of behavior, to add rather than subtract. The counselor examines three broad protective domains: peer group, family, and community. In this LI, we will focus on specific tools and skills that can be developed and imparted to clients at various developmental stages, including childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. We will also explore specific tools to facilitate resilience in your personal and professional lives. 11003 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 206 Balancing Disaster Mental Health: Resilient Individuals, Resilient Communities, Resilient Counselors Gerard Lawson, PhD, Barbara Herlihy, PhD, Simone F . Lambert, PhD, Reshelle C. Marino, MEdCounselors who volunteer their time and talent for Disaster Mental Health (DMH) services face the devastation of natural and human-made disasters, and often do not see the positive growth that can occur in the long run. This session highlights the potential for resilience and posttraumatic growth that exists for individuals, communities, and even counselors following trauma. The presenters will provide specific strategies for counselors before, during, and after a DMH deployment to prepare their clients and themselves for growth and resilience. This LI provides a great way for counselors who served the people of New Orleans to return to the area and prepare for a conference focused on growth and resilience. 11004 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 207 The Essence of Intimacy: Experiencing the Fundamentals of Sex Counseling Through Sexual Attitude Restructuring (SAR) Amy Rebecca Marsh, DHS \"The Essence of Intimacy\" is an experiential encounter with carefully selected media, content, and discussions designed to broaden your understanding of a wider range of human sexual behaviors. SAR programs are important experiences for any professional working in sexuality. As an attendee, you may confront your own \"hot buttons\" and learn to set these aside in order to cultivate a nonjudgmental, sex-positive professional attitude. Topics include LGBTQI, non-monogamy, aging, disability, masturbation, alternative sexualities, ethics, and diversity. You will view a full program of explicit media and discussion and you will be asked to discuss topics at lunch in small groups. Presenter is disabled by chemical exposures and environmental illness. Please take this into consideration. 11006 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 208 Advanced Play Therapy: Improve Skills in Theme Analysis, Work With Parents, Aligning Philosophy and Advocating for Practice Dee Ray, PhD This LI will provide advanced level training to practicing play therapists in areas cited as crucial to play therapy practice. This LI, designed for play therapists across school, community, and private settings, introduces a model of play theme identification and analysis to increase efficacy of response and consultation. This LI presents a model for parent consultation that can be individualized for children from diverse backgrounds or presenting problems. You will learn advocacy skills including aligning humanistic philosophy with current treatment planning and diagnosis standards, and how to use technological and research resources for the purposes of systemic advocacy and marketing of practice. APT CE credit available 11007 Introductory, Convention Center, Room 209 Implementing Solution-Focused Brief Counseling With Youth Gerald B. Sklare, EdD This experiential LI is designed for counselors working with youth who want to learn to implement an innovative approach to empower children and adolescents to recognize and utilize their resources in order to overcome their issues in a minimal amount of time. Although the LI will feature cases with youth, the solution-focused approach can be generalized to older populations, adults, couples, and families.

Robert Walsh, MA, Norman C. Dasenbrook, MS Private practice for many mental health providers has been an elusive goal. \"Starting a Successful Private Practice\" is a \"nuts and bolts\" presentation that addresses setting up a practice with minimal investment as well as enhancing a practice with prudent investment, marketing and advertising, dealing with managed care, setting fees, and general practice management. Ethical business practices are emphasized. Materials will include examples of forms and marketing materials. Dasenbrookand Walsh are authors of ACA's website \"Private Practice Pointers\" and Counseling Today's \"Private Practice in Counseling.\" 11009 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 211-212 Domestic Violence in Military Families Kerrie K. D. Wheeler, MA Statistically, 1 in every 4 women will experience violence at the hand of someone they know and love. Military families struggling with domestic violence issues face unique challenges related to the nature of the problem and the potential consequences of disclosure. PTSD related to combat service further complicates an already sophisticated set of problems and family/relationship dynamics. As more traditional Reser ve and National Guar d members are activated, helping professionals practicing hundreds of miles from a military base will find themselves serving this unfamiliar population and searching for answers in a bureaucracy that challenges even its own employees. Leave with an outline for how to serve these families. EvENING SESSIONS 5:30 pm-8:45 pm 11011 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 201-202 Disaster Mental Health Interventions for Children: Evidence-Based Practices to Promote Recovery and Resiliency Jennifer N. Baggerly, PhD, Eric Green, PhD Millions of children worldwide experience devastating disasters every year. Counselors need developmentally appropriate evidence-based interventions to promote recovery. Presenters will (a) provide research-based information about the prevalence and impact of disasters on children relative to their developmental level and culture; (b) identify culturally appropriate assessment and triage methods; (c) discuss guiding principles recommended by the National Child T raumatic Stress Network as well as the World Health Organization; and (d) demonstrate best practices of psychological first aid, trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy, and disaster response play therapy. Video of interventions with children will be shown. APT CE credit available11012 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 203-204 Individual Psychology: Relevant Theoretical Principles and Advanced Techniques for Today's Counselor Susan E. Belangee, PhD The purpose of this LI is to provide accurate understanding of Alfred Adler's theory of individual psychology in order to demonstrate some of the advanced techniques Adlerian counselors use daily in practice. Attendees who currently incorporate some Adlerian ideas and techniques into their practice will benefit the most from this advanced LI.

Ceballos, PhD, Clarrice A. Rapisarda, PhD, Angela Sheely-Moore, PhD Whereas traditional play therapy is too juvenile for adolescents, talk therapy can be too intimidating, leaving counselors who work with this population searching for a bridge between the two formats. Through discussions, experiential activities, and video clips of actual counseling sessions, attendees will discover the rationale for offering activity therapy to teens ages 10-16. Attendees will learn how to set up a therapy room conducive to the needs of teens. Specific skills to conduct therapy for this age group from a humanistic approach will be demonstrated.

Barry Mascari, EdD, Jane Webber, PhD, Michael Dubi, EdD Are you ready to help survivors in the immediate aftermath of a disaster? Providing Psychological first aid (PFA) is as critical as medical first aid. We now know that survivors recover more quickly and often experience posttraumatic growth with a non-intrusive, compassionate approach that facilitates safety, engagement, stabilization, and empowerment. This presentation will describe the core principles of using PFA to protect, direct, and connect with survivors. We will demonstrate and practice PFA techniques including active lurking, calming, entrainment, box breathing, grounding, and compassionate loitering. You will be invited to practice PFA approaches using STOP and SOLER in a simulated disaster tabletop exercise.11018 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 211-212 Childhood Obesity: Counseling Interventions for Children and Families Mandy L. Perryman, PhD, Jeanne Booth, PhD, Steve Nielsen, PhD Childhood obesity is a primary public health concern due to the severity of its physical, emotional, and psychosocial consequences. As a multidimensional issue, comprehensive interventions are needed. Research clearly indicates that family-based treatment is essential to reverse this epidemic. This LI addresses how counselors can inspire investment from the family for change, the essential components for successful treatment, and restructuring of the family dynamic as it relates to nutrition and activity. You will also explore the holistic application of these same counseling interventions to empower children and families and promote a healthy, respectful, and nurturing family system. 11019 Introductory, Convention Center, Room 214 The Next Ten Minutes: Seriously Playful Techniques for Bringing Mindfulness Into Your Counseling Practice Andrew Peterson, EdD The current explosion of scientific insight into the neurological benefits of mindfulness practices presents counselors with tremendous opportunities for improving therapeutic outcomes with clients. How does one harness this vast scientific literature within the confines of a 50-minute counseling session? In this LI, attendees will learn simple but effective techniques to help clients (and themselves) harness the power of mindfulness practices within the routines of their day-to-day lives. Attendees will explore the research supporting the benefits of mindfulness practice in psychotherapy and will participate in several experiential exercises based on these principles. 11020 Introductory, Convention Center, Room 215-216 Addressing Challenging Behaviors in Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorders in Community and School-based Settings Chris Mann Sullivan, PhD As of May 2010, the Center for Disease Control estimated that the rate of autism is now 1 in 110 children. Community and school counselors often find themselves being called upon to address the challenging behaviors of persons with autism despite having little or no training in this area. This LI aims to provide counselors with the basics regarding how to conduct a basic functional analysis (used as part of positive behavior support programs) and subsequently how to address common challenging behaviors using evidence-based interventions.

There is little written about post-disaster mental health and what happens in a region in the years following a disaster. Individuals on the MS Gulf Coast, representing sevencommunity and state agencies, came together after Hurricane Katrina to address this issue. Supported by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Utah's successful Intermountain Healthcare Mental Health Integration (MHI) model was implemented in primary care. You will participate in community asset mapping, an assessment of community barriers and enabling factors, and an exercise for team building of community wellness, and you will leave with a business plan for MHI implementation. 11026 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 209 Infusing College and Career Readiness Counseling Into Counselor Education: Rethinking School Counselor Preparation Vivian V. Lee, EdD, Rachelle Perusse, PhD, Robert Colbert, PhD This LI is for counselor educators who teach master's level school counseling students and those with administrative responsibility over a school counseling master's program.

Counselors Working in Family Court as Custody Evaluators, Family Mediators, and Parent Coordinators Michelle Mitcham, PhD, Michelle Muenzenmeyer Glover, MS Learn about the various \"hats\" professional counselors can wear if you are thinking about diversifying your practice to work in the family court system as a child custody investigator/evaluator, social investigator, family mediator, or parenting coordinator. The family court system has experienced a major shift in the treatment of family law cases, especially those involving children. Family court systems are embracing a more collaborative, interdisciplinary approach, or a \"therapeutic\" path to helping families transition post-divorce. Even professional counselors who choose not to work in the family court dispute resolution services typically treat clients who are experiencing high-conflict divorce. LCA Sponsored Session 11028 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 211-212 Psychopharmacology for the Psychotherapist Sattaria Smith Dilks, MA This LI will allow for in-depth exploration of the various psychopharmacological treatment options with the mentally ill.

Wubbolding, EdD You will learn cutting-edge, advanced tools and techniques to deal with clients in crisis due to disaster events or who feel separated and alienated from family, especially military families. Reality therapy is especially applicable to intense problems and difficult behaviors such as feelings of being put upon, a sense of powerlessness, and the perception of having no possible escape from pain. Discussion of the advanced use of the WDEP (wants, doing, evaluation, planning) system of reality therapy illustrates the practicality of this multicultural validated system.

APT CE credit available 11038 Introductory, Convention Center, Room 211-212 Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Approaches to Alcohol and Other Drug Use in Adolescents Matthew Snyder, PhD, Lynn Zubernis, PhD Motivational interviewing (MI) is a collaborative approach in which the client's own intrinsic motivations and resources for change are evoked by exploring and resolving ambivalence toward change. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is mostly used to treat depression, anxiety disorders, phobias, and other mental issues, but it has also been shown to be useful in treating issues related to alcohol and other drug addiction, especially as part of an overall program of recovery. This LI includes current thinking on the process of behavior change and provides detailed guidelines for putting MI into practice. The presentation then focuses on CBT techniques that have been shown to be most effective with adolescent populations. 11039 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 205 Integrating Sandplay Into Counseling: Techniques for Therapeutic Disclosure, Trauma, and Healing Jane Webber, PhD, J.

Presbury, James Madison University, Harrisonburg, VA, Eric W. Cowan, Lennis G. EchterlingFor decades, critics have pejoratively referred to counseling as touchy-feely, meaning that they considered it to be without scientific foundation.

There is science supporting our basic approach to working with clients. The presenters will discuss the above concepts using PowerPoint and video clips, host a question-and-answer follow-up, and offer a handout with references for attendees. 7:30 am - 8:30 am Counselor Education & Supervision AcademySchool Counseling AcademyProgram ID #120, Convention Center, Room 211 Responding to the Gates Report: Examining the Critique of School Counselors and Refreshing the Profession's Advocacy 60-Minute Session Caroline Baker, University of Wisconsin-River Falls, River Falls, WI, Maureen Casamassimo The Gates Report on the effectiveness of high school ACA Annu A l Conferen C e & e xposition p rogr A m g uide | 37 Friday Education Sessions counselors in preparing students for college yields results harmful to our profession.

How Academic Self-Efficacy and Degree Prestige Guide the Choice of a College Major 30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Leann Wyrick-Morgan, University of T exas at Tyler, Tyler, TX, Levi S. McClendon For some young adults, perception is everything. For somecollege students, the perceptions they have about the likelihood that they will complete a degree program are what drive them to choose a major, not making the connection to the job that may or may not materialize upon graduation.

There is much research and literature available on this topic as well. There has been, however, no attempt to address the unique needs of those who supervise career professionals including those who provide career services in a variety of settings including higher education, workforce development, and corporate settings. At the behest of the Japan Career Development Association, NCDA undertook the task of developing a curriculum to train supervisors of career professionals. This session will outline the training and highlight the sections that address the special needs of this population. 7:30 am - 8:30 am Addictions AcademyProgram ID #346, Convention Center, Room 219 Alcohol Screening and Brief Interventions for English- and Spanish-speaking Medical Center Trauma Unit Patients 60-Minute Session Nathaniel Nicholas Ivers, University of T exas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, Laura J. Veach In Chinese, the word for crisis is written with two dichotomous symbols, one meaning danger and the other, opportunity. In this session, we discuss the positive impact of talking with people, even for a brief 20 minutes, about their risky drinking behaviors while they are in crisis (e.g., admitted to the hospital for injuries sustained due to risky drinking). Concomitantly, a grant-funded research study involving a prospective randomized clinical trial of two distinct brief counseling interventions for ACA Annu A l Conferen C e & e xposition p rogr A m g uide | 77 Saturday Education Sessions hospitalized adult trauma patients is discussed.

Gintner, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA Most of the comments about the proposed DSM-5 draft have focused on the introduction of a number of new disorders. Less attention, however, has been paid to more fundamental changes such as the recommendation to merge axis I-III, the creation of various spectrum disorders, and the introduction of dimensional rating scales. This session examines the rationale and supporting evidence for each of these changes and discusses implications for counselors, clients, and the delivery of mental health services. 7:30 am - 8:30 am Military Counseling AcademyProgram ID #348, Convention Center, Room 212 Peer Counseling in the Military 60-Minute Session Richard Long, Columbus State University, Columbus, GA, Jeff VoylesBecause of the limitations of its mental health treatment plan for soldiers, the military understands the need for civilian help. Statistics show that the numbers are worrisomely high in the following areas: suicide, soldier-on-soldier killings, mental health hospitalizations, and the increased use of psychotropic medication. This session will provide counselor educators with an overview of military culture, an example of a peer counseling training program, a chance to outline a program of their own, and an explanation of ways to tap into counseling in the military.

Understanding what the National Guard is presently doing to assist military members will better equip the civilian counselor who interfaces with them. 7:30 am - 8:30 am Addictions AcademyProgram ID #350, Convention Center, Room 211 Prisoner Re-entry: Treatment Needs for the Chemically Dependent Offender 60-Minute Session, Advanced Kelley B. McNichols, Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, PA There has been substantial research that has addressed raising incarceration rates that plague our criminal justice system. Specific focus has explored the co-morbidity between addiction and criminality. Inmates sentenced for drug-related crimes significantly contribute to the soaring rates of incarceration. In the midst of the increasing number of people who enter the criminal justice system, the challenge of prisoner reintegration has been largely overlooked. Offenders who were originally convicted of drug-related crimes had the second highest rate of recidivism. It becomes clearly evident that the counseling field needs to enhance treatment services provided to chemically dependent offenders throughout their reentry experience. 7:30 am - 8:30 am AHC (formerly C-AHEAD) Wellness CenterWellness AcademyProgram ID #351, Convention Center, Room R05 Morning Meditation 60-Minute Session Mark D.

Smith, Antioch University New England, Keene, NHThe impact of stigma on those with a mental illness is immense; the stigma of having a mental illness can be as damaging as the symptoms. Thus, stigma and mental illness are an important area of investigation. Measurement of the construct stigma toward individuals with mental illness is a challenge that faces researchers engaging in efforts aimed at the eradication of stigma. This session will introduce the Perceptions of Mental Illness, a current, psychometrically sound instrument to measure mental illness stigma. Additionally, you will learn about mental illness stigma and the process used for developing an instrument in the social sciences. 10:30 am - 11:00 am Program ID #360, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS9 How Do Perfectionists Cope With Stress? 30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session, AdvancedPhilip Gnilka, Kent State University, Kent, OH Perfectionism is increasingly being viewed as a multidimensional construct that can be differentiated between two types: a positive version called \"adaptive\" perfectionism and a negative form called \"maladaptive\" perfectionism.

Rhode, T exas T ech University, Lubbock, TX This session will provide data on the effect of career counseling on the residential juvenile offender population. Specifically, the session will report changes in career maturity and self-efficacy after a 12-week group counseling intervention. The hypothesis 80 | ACA Annu A l Conferen C e & e xposition p rogr A m g uide Saturday Education Sessions proposed by this line of research is that implementing career counseling as a part of the counseling curriculum for residential juvenile offenders will improve the participants' beliefs about their ability to choose and acquire work, and it will give them a more realistic perspective on careers in general. Improvement in these areas could then improve the lives of the participants by reducing recidivism, increasing self-esteem, and improving academic interest and performance. 10:30 am - 11:00 am Program ID #365, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS14 The Therapeutic Relationship in Online and Face-to-Face Counseling: Past Research and Future Directions 30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Courtney M.

Wood, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, Lisa Thompson-Gillespie, Arie T. Greenleaf With U.S. troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and America's war on terror, there is critical need for school counselors to support children from military families. However, students whose parents are active duty but not in a war zone have needs as well. The stressors of parent deployment and reintegration, single-parent care-taking, family restructuring, divorce and relocation, academic progress, and fitting in also impact these students. The purpose of this session is to detail the current counseling literature on students of military families\u2014including needs and challenges, developmental struggles, suggested strategies, and facilitating student resiliencies\u2014 and to brainstorm programs and collaborative opportunities. 10:30 am - 11:00 am Program ID #369, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS18 Incivility in the Classroom: Current Trends, Implications, and Best Practices 30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Lisa Ren\u00e9 Jackson-Cherry, Marymount University, Arlington, VA, William Sterner Reports of student incivility have increased in higher education over the years. Tolerance of these behaviors has focused on fear of decreased enrollments, \"consumer mentality\" of students, generational differences regarding the learning process, and an increased enrollment of students with psychological and learning issues. Regardless, disruptions potentially interfere with the learning environment, impede student academic and personal growth, interfere with classroom management, and can cause burnout for faculty. This panel discussion will focus on current research being conducted, faculty experiences, and best practices for implementing strategies to maintain classroom control and to create a positive learning and teaching environment.

Wakefield, University of Nevada - Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV, Douglas L. Garner, Dale E. Pehrsson Cultural competency has emerged as a dynamic initiative and critical need shaping education, the work of practitioners, and research. It is an active process, an ongoing pursuit of self-reflection, knowledge acquisition, and skill development. The media's use of documentaries and popular film series brings forth a cultural perspective. Yet, each culture has a story of struggles and strengths. As competent counselors work to integrate issues of diversity into their counseling work, exploring the media's historical context of underrepresented populations with a Critical Cultural Competency Domains Model can offer a meaningful approach to facilitating greater understanding of diversity, aligning interventions, and promoting change. 10:30 am - 11:00 am Program ID #371, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS20 Counselor Supervision and Technology: Let's Get on Board! 30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session, Advanced Jonathan Lent, John Carroll University, University Heights, OH, Paula J.

Externalization describes problems as being external characters who oppress clients and therapy as a process in which clients fight against being oppressed by problems. Although externalization has been successfully applied to numerous types of problems, the oppression/liberation metaphor inherently restricts counselors to a patriarchic and culturally bound view of problem-solving as having power over problems. This session will address limitations of the oppression/liberation metaphor by exploring metaphors that are sensitive to and resonant with the client's preferred descriptions and culture. 12:30 pm - 1:00 pm Program ID #429, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS17 Pre-, Peri-, and Post-migration Experiences and Adjustment of Adolescent Refugees in the U.S.: Implications for Counselors 30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Bellah Kiteki, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC The ongoing wars and political conflicts around the world have contributed to a mass migration of many civilians seeking refuge in developed countries.

Therefore, counselors must have an understanding of veterans' experiences in order to serve the therapeutic needs of these individuals. Veterans' continuing, unresolved issues related to deployment may be understood in terms of ambiguous loss, that is, experiences of loss or separation that defy closure. Van Deurzen's Four Worlds Model provides not only a holistic, existential approach to address the physical, social, personal, and spiritual needs of these clients, but also an appropriate framework for mental health service provision. 3:30 pm - 4:00 pm Program ID #489, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS16 The Relationship Between CACREP Accreditation and Scores on Professional Counselor Licensure Examinations 30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Jason H.

With addicted clients doing 12-step work, these unfinished issues continuously re-surface in the person's life in the form of relapse, transferring of addictions, co-occurring disorders, and reduced quality of life. Interventions include first assessing a client's spiritual life and evaluating for signs of spiritual bypass. Motivational interviewing, an evidenced-based practice for treating addiction, can then be incorporated to address the spiritual bypass problem. 3:45 pm - 4:45 pm Program ID #507, Convention Center, Room 217 The Personal Is P olitical: Integrating Feminist Theory With Other Theoretical Applications 60-Minute Session, AdvancedJoanne Jodry, Monmouth University, West Long Branch, NJ, Kathleen Armstrong This advanced interactive session will allow you to integrate the use of feminist principles within other well-used theoretical models.

Wyrick-Morgan Ever wondered how homophobic statements affect victims and those within earshot? This is the time to explore the possibilities. Researchers have addressed the effect of bullying behaviors on academic achievement, but the presenters for this session have studied homophobic bullying and associated behaviors toward others (gay-baiting) and specifically address the effect this can have on academic achievement. Further, the way students perceive life events, or locus of control, may dictate how gay-baiting and homophobic bullying are perceived in students responding to homophobic banter. This interactive session will provide insight about how homophobic bullying and related homophobic epithets affect academic achievement in high school students. 3:45 pm - 4:45 pm Mental Health/Private Practice AcademyProgram ID #509, Convention Center, Room 219 Dialectical Behavior Therapy: An Introduction and Useful Techniques for Mental Health Counselors106 | ACA Annu A l Conferen C e & e xposition p rogr A m g uide Saturday Education Sessions 60-Minute Session K.

Stoltz, University of Mississippi, University, MS, Rebekah Reysen, Susan R. Barclay Counselor supervision takes place at two critical stages in a counselor's career development. Although supervision is focused traditionally on developing clinical skills, there is significant literature that supports additional roles for the supervisor. We posit that one role is that of career counselor. In this session, participants will learn about career construction theory and how to use concepts from the theory to support supervisees' career self-concept. Helping supervisees understand their idiosyncratic career self-concepts and adaptability attributes lays a foundation for supporting their transitions into the world of professional counseling. You will receive handouts, case studies, and a reference list. 3:45 pm - 4:45 pm Social Justice AcademyProgram ID #513, Convention Center, Room 211 ACA Human Rights Committee Special Symposium on Counseling Immigrants: Awareness and Advocacy 60-Minute Session Angela D.

Henfield, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA The low academic achievement of African American students in comparison with their peers has been well-documented in popular and scholarly literature.

As such, drawing on the findings of a larger qualitative research study, this session will detail the experiences of African American males in a predominantly White middle school. According to the findings, Black male participants, dependent on their various backgrounds, were aware of some but not other types of microaggressions.

Glosoff, Montclair State University, Montclair, NJ, Sandra I. Lopez-Baez Although the relationship between spirituality and other cultural factors is complex, many theorists present spirituality as an innate component of culture. The process of becoming a multiculturally literate counselor involves resistance and fear as a byproduct of reconciling cultural information that may seem contradictory to one's experiences. In this interactive session, we will explore how fear of the unfamiliar naturally creates resistance to learning new information. We will also discuss ways in which working with students to identity spiritual aspects of their being (e.g., meaning and purpose, a sense of interconnectedness) may be one way to help them work through such resistance.

McAdams, College of William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA, John A. Dewell Parental rejection is not a singular event but instead is re-experienced by children regularly through rejecting parents' continual disappointments, broken promises, and dashed hopes. When the grief of rejection has been targeted for intervention, it has been viewed as a normal reaction to the finite loss of parental involvement, with recovery involving a child's movement from the loss through progressive stages of healing. Research suggests that children who experience perpetually recurring losses may not be subject to traditional emotional responses but rather to chronic sorrow, a distinct type of emotional distress that requires specialized considerations for counseling intervention.

Lauderdale, FL, Mercedes ter Maat School counselors often get stuck performing non-counseling related duties because their administration's primary goal is to improve test scores. Administrators do not typically see the connection between counseling and increased test scores; therefore, counseling services take a back burner to test-related duties. This session will help counselors overcome this obstacle by linking counseling services to the administration's goals of improving test scores.

Ross Counselors in both U.S. and international settings are trained to learn counseling theories and strategies based predominantly on Western culture. It is uncertain whether the Western-based theories apply well to the international settings. The panel will share its extensive experiences of teaching counseling in either U.S. or non-U.S. settings to illustrate challenges of applying Western-based counseling concepts to international students in and outside of the U.S. The ecological analysis of complexity of teaching and practicing Western-based counseling theories to international populations or settings will be demonstrated to examine and enhance your own teaching and practicing strategies with diverse populations. 11:45 am - 1:15 pm Program ID #603, Convention Center, Room 207 \"Crying Wolf\": Threat Assessment on Campuses 90-Minute Session Rick A. Myer, Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, PA, Richard K. James Making a decision about the veracity of a threat is no easy task. Make the wrong decision and someone might die, but if you cry wolf too often, everyone stops listening and then the potential for making a wrong decision becomes more likely. This session outlines several perspectives that can be used to analyze threats. These perspectives allow you to sort through a situation in order to make the best decision possible given the nature of a threat. Breaking down threats into clear components makes decisions less subjective in order to make better decisions that are based in fact and not conjecture. 11:45 am - 1:15 pm Couples & Family Counseling AcademyRehabilitation Counseling and Disability Issues AcademyProgram ID #604, Convention Center, Room 208 Children Diagnosed With Autism Spectrum Disorder: What Impact Does the Diagnosis Have on Mothers? 90-Minute Session, Advanced Tracie Self, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, Cindy Boyle As diagnosed cases of autism spectrum disorder continue to rise, so does the need for skilled practitioners in schools and communities to work with these families.

Being on the verge of complete burnout withoverwork had led me to explore alternative modalities of healing...as much formyself as for my clients. \"I knew the moment I picked up Barbara's book Hands of Light \u00aethat I had to attend the school. Almost immediately after enrolling, major changes beganoccurring in my life. \"The school, with its wonderful teachers, set me on a journey of self-discovery and movement toward wholeness. In 2000, I gave up my job and now have a thriving healing practice in which I use my skills asa counselor, along with hands-on healing. I now know what it is to be 'embodied.' \"I speak from my entire being when I say I love all that I've created in my life. It is the life of my dreams, and I can thank Barbara...and myself...for this extraordinary gift.\" \u2014Madeleine Conger, Louisiana 2002 BBSH\u00aeGraduate Visit us at Booth #215 BARBARA BRENNAN SCHOOL OF HEALING\u00ae 1-800-924-2564 www.barbarabrennan.com 500 NE Spanish River Blvd., Suite 208, Boca Raton, FL 33431\u00ae ACA Annu A l Conferen C e & e xposition p rogr A m g uide | 195 Abath, Diana G.
