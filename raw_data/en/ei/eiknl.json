Currently, [fibromyalgia](/health/fibromyalgia) has no cure, and doctors aren't currently sure what causes it. Standard treatments for the symptoms of fibromyalgia include pain relievers, antidepressants, and antiseizure drugs. These can help reduce symptoms like pain, fatigue, and insomnia. For some people, though, these medications may not provide the perfect solution. They may cause side effects that make them difficult to keep taking, and they may not adequately relieve the pain. Because of this, lifestyle changes and more natural remedies are often recommended. Below are a few of the more popular natural remedies for fibromyalgia. Several studies suggest that yoga may help ease symptoms of fibromyalgia. A small, older [study from 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5568073/) A newer [case report from 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7014847/) A [study from 2019](https://www.dovepress.com/impact-of-daily-yoga-based-exercise-on-pain-catastrophizing-and-sleep--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JPR) also found that [yoga](/nutrition/13-benefits-of-yoga) seemed to lessen symptoms of pain and improve sleep, albeit modestly. Researchers caution that the more one sticks with an actual yoga practice, the better it works on pain and sleep. They also caution that more studies need to be done to better understand which individuals this natural remedy may benefit the most. Can meditation change the way your brain processes pain signals? The jury is still out on that, but it's clear that meditation can provide some relief from fibromyalgia pain. A [clinical review from 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4802162/) [meditation](/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation) can relieve the severity of fibromyalgia symptoms, as well as perceived stress. A newer [review from 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5693231/) [mindfulness meditation](/health/mental-health/types-of-meditation) may improve instances of pain, stress, and symptom severity in individuals living with fibromyalgia. The study goes on to say that more research needs to be done to see if meditation truly helps creative physiological changes or simply allows an individual to deal with their symptoms better. Massage therapy can be very beneficial for a variety of conditions, including fibromyalgia. According to a [2014 review,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3930706/) Even though it may be difficult to motivate yourself to work out when you're dealing with a flare of fibromyalgia pain, studies show that both aerobic exercise and weightlifting are beneficial. In fact, a [2017 review](http://href=) If you've never lifted weights before, make sure to talk with a certified personal trainer about some helpful [moves to start with](/health/how-to-start-lifting-weights). [Acupuncture](/health/does-acupuncture-hurt) is an ancient form of traditional Chinese medicine in which thin needles are inserted into your skin at different points of your body. It's used to treat a variety of conditions. According to a [2019 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6365227/) [Tai chi](/health/tai-chi-benefits) is another ancient Chinese practice. It involves moving your body slowly and gently through a series of poses and has shown some potential for easting fibromyalgia symptoms. According to a [2018 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29563100/) Fibromyalgia is a stress-related pain condition, which means that symptoms may increase when stress [hormones like cortisol rise](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79349-0_) [2019 study](https://jrh.mazums.ac.ir/article-1-578-en.html), stress management classes for women with fibromyalgia seemed to reduce the amount of pain they experienced. According to the same study, counseling with cognitive behavioral approaches also reduced markers of inflammation and pain. People with fibromyalgia [often](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737175.2020.1794824) have a history of [post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)](/health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder) and should be screened and treated for this, as those with PTSD can experience stress more intently. Research on fibromyalgia is ongoing. Experts continue to make new discoveries around what may be causing the condition, as well as what treatments are most effective. In addition to the natural remedies above, keeping to a nutrient-rich diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables [can be](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7888848/) Getting adequate amounts of vitamins B and D, as well as iron, may also help with your symptoms. Talk with a healthcare professional about the possibility of adding vitamins to your daily routine. If standard medications aren't giving you the relief you need, talk with a healthcare professional about complementary therapies. Massage therapy, yoga, meditation, or other options may not only help with pain but may also improve your quality of life. "}
