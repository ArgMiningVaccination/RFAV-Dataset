And of the karmic inspirations that direct its course! The Christian festivals in the course of the year remind us of new beginnings, Easter with the resurrection, for instance, or Whitsun with the inner Christ coming to life in us. These new beginnings cannot be understood without the events that preceded them. The process initiated at the Goetheanum in order to shape its profile also relates to previous developments. The Goetheanum Leadership has worked through the his - tory of the various Sections of the School of Spiritual Science and is now focus - ing on the forthcoming centenary of the 1923/1924 Christmas Conference. The new beginning is bound to make an impact. Spirit presence The strength needed for such an impact can be gained from inner reflection. In cultic life, according to Rudolf Steiner, a special power manifests because the cult allows people \u00abto experience shared memories of a pre-earthly existence\u00bb. The joint an - throposophical work, he said, aimed at a present experience because it was about allowing a real spirit being to be present suprasensibly, through our souls, through our inner soul constitution ( ga 257, lecture of 27 February 1923). If such an experience becomes \u00aba shared memory, or shared life\u00bb, a foundation is being created for \u00abstaying together in the spirit\u00bb, even if, due to earthly conditions, we will be \u00abseparated again and again by space\u00bb ( ga 226, 21 May 1923). This is an allusion to the community- building potential of shared experiences or shared memories. The image of starting school can help us to gain awareness of the complex interre - lationships of individuals and communities. As human beings we are, we have evolved and we continue to evolve: our spirit-soul participates in the eternal while our body and soul develop in time, in the transitory (ga 184, 15 September 1918). A community has needs that either relate mainly to expe - riences from pre-earthly existence or mainly to the present moment. All these aspects, with all the qualities and laws they imply, are at work simultaneously and inform our coexistence. | Sebastian J\u00fcngel antroposophical society Experience becomes life: the eastern sun at the Goetheanum September 2017 N\u00b0 9 Anthroposophical Society 1 Living together 2 Appeal for donations Newssheets 10 nz: Sphere, Scope, Ardent gb: New View 14 Dorothea Hellmuth ten Siethoff Audience response to Faust Anthroposophy Worldwide 3 Switzerland: Equality of Anthroposophic Medicine 7 gb: Foundation Stone Conference 8 Germany: Showing strength Nepal: Light Eurythmy Ensemble 9 Sweden: Mystery Drama Conference 11 Germany: Fritz Fuchs book project School of Spiritual Science 4 Section for Social Sciences: Economics Conference 5 Humanities Section: Colloquium on the Language in Poetry 6 Natural Science Section: Research Colloquium on evolutionary biology Forum 11 The culmination of anthroposophy 13 Rudolf Steiner's financial genius Feature 16 Living WarmthLiving together The power of experiencing spirit together In many places the new school year has started. New beginnings always mean that something has come to a conclusion: the time in kindergarten ends when the main school starts. The first seven-year period is complete, the second begins. There is no new beginning without something finishing. If this conclusion does not happen, the new beginning can be overshadowed by lingering influences.2 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 9/17 Appeal for donations Financially viable within three years In Anthroposophy Worldwide 7-8/2017 Justus Wittich, treasurer at the Goethe - anum, asked for your support for the Goetheanum's tasks and plans. The aim is to provide a solid financial basis for the goals and projects the Goetheanum Leadership has set out to accomplish and to attain economic viability by 2020. In order to achieve this, additional do - nations will be needed initially. More detailed information on the plans and paths envisaged will be published in late summer | Sebastian J\u00fcngelStage: audience response to the three full performances of Goethe's Faust Parts 1 and 2 Modern but not faddish Christian Peter's unabridged production of Goethe's Faust 1 and 2 was performed three times at the Goetheanum in July this year. The written responses received by the Goetheanum Stage from audience mem - bers were largely positive, if not enthusi - astic. More and more voices are asking for more performances. The first part of the play will be shown in Munich on 23 September. \u00abOutstanding (a verdict expressed twice!). Please resume.\u00bb This response is represen - tative of dozens of others asking for the performances to be continued. \u00abFinally a performance that can be recommended to non-anthroposophists, too. [...] Top-class!\u00bb The feedback received is a response to the decision taken by the Goetheanum Leader - ship to discontinue the new production of Faust (Anthroposophy Worldwide 1-2/2017). Public discussions were offered alongside the new production during the 2016 perfor - mances and in the first half of 2017, where impressions, questions and reservations could be aired. A formal statement and a Membership meeting on the Faust produc - tion - as decided at the last Annual General Meeting (see Anthroposophy Worldwide 5/2017, p. 9f.) are still outstanding. Since then the ensemble continued working towards the revival of the play in July, af - ter three main parts were newly cast for various reasons (Gretchen, one of the two Faust actors and one of the two Mephistos). The production has matured. With this in mind, Stefan Hasler, who represents the Goetheanum Stage within the Goethea - num Leadership, told the Faust Ensemble after the final performance, \u00abIsn't it great that we have a new problem? The Goethe- anum Leadership will certainly consider whether and how to go on with the Faust.\u00bb The soul world imagined through light What was it that convinced the audience? The production was all in all \u00abmodern with - out being faddish,\u00bb \u00abrelaxed, humorous, but true to Goethe's spirit and to Anthro - posophy\u00bb, \u00abwholeheartedly presented\u00bb, no sense of any \u00abpressure to be more contem - porary\u00bb. All the arts involved were praised; eurythmy in particular was mentioned pos- itively again and again, as were individual actors. Others commended the \u00abnatural speech that enhanced expression\u00bb and the \u00ababsence of self-enamoured the \u00abbeautiful singing - tumes and wonderful, swinging fabrics\u00bb, \u00abthe colour that emerged through the light. This was not yet possible in Roggenkamp's time. The soul world was imagined through light\u00bb. The ensemble had achieved a \u00absocial sculpture that was true to life\u00bb. What did the critical voices say? An oc - casional lack of clarity was mentioned (\u00abThe old Faust could whisper more clearly!\u00bb) Some found the overlapping of speech and music difficult, even if the \u00abwords were meant to fade away\u00bb. Homunculus did not meet everyone's approval, and the three Hel - enas were also called into question (\u00aba nice idea - but does it really add to the play?\u00bb) With regard to the music someone thought that the mood was sometimes \u00abtoo musi- cal-like\u00bb. One critical question aimed at the concept was \u00abWhy blue petals for Faust?\u00bb Limited demand While attendance was below expectation for the first two performances (around 300 tickets sold, plus tickets for individual parts), the third performance was much better attended (around 550 tickets sold, plus tickets for individual parts). \u00abWhy this lack of interest?\u00bb someone asked and at - tempted an explanation, \u00abThe production has been badmouthed internally as well as externally by those opposed to the artistic realization - what a shame!\u00bb \u00abWhat you have shown here is a purifica - tion of the water,\u00bb was surely the most po- etic of all the responses. | Sebastian J\u00fcngel Goetheanum antroposophical society Scene from Faust 1, Act 1 No. 9/17 | 3 Natural medicine, which has been used for millennia and continues to be very popu - lar, has been marginalized - in therapy, re - search, tuition and politics - by natural-sci - entific mainstream medicine and pharmacy. Even proven treatments of complementary or alternative medicine continue to face vehement opposition. In order to counter - act this development and overcome the existential threat posed to these healing systems with their wealth of medicines and therapies, a broad umbrella organization was set up in Switzerland thirty years ago, initiated and led by the \u00abAssociation for Anthroposophically Extended Medicine\u00bb (now anthrosana), which was founded in 1977. This cooperation with other comple - mentary medical approaches was neces - sary, because the anthroposophical medical movement was quite small, and turns out in retrospect to have been crucial in achieving a breakthrough in medical politics. Forum for Freedom in Healthcare After the initial building up and political ad - vances this \u00abForum for Freedom in Health - care\u00bb ( ffg) - supported by the National Councillor and anthroposophist Rudolf Haf - ner - saw its first successes in 1993 when it gained a seat on the Swiss Drug Com - mission, where it was represented by the pharmacist Silvia Briggen. The ffg gained a lasting political success in the following year when it courageously took on the referendum against the new health insur - ance act. Its arguments - that the new law, with defined services and obligatory health insurance, was too prescriptive without being cost-reducing, that it was fully com - mitted to mainstream medicine and that it therefore posed an existential threat to the consideration of complementary medi - cine in public healthcare - even found a sympathetic ear with the responsible Swiss government minister Ruth Dreifuss. In late 1994 the law was nevertheless ac - cepted by the voters with a very slight major - ity, but the previously received promise that complementary medicine should be consid - ered was fortunately soon implemented. In 1999 the most popular approaches in complementary medicine - Anthroposophic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine, homeopathy, neural therapy and phytother - apy - were included in mandatory health - care, provisionally for a period of six years, during which time the effectiveness, expe - diency and economy of these approaches were to be scientifically scrutinized as part of the Programme for the Evaluation of Complementary Medicine ( pek), for which six million Swiss Francs were set aside. Successful popular initiative In 2003, shortly before this evaluation was concluded, major changes occurred: Home Secretary Ruth Dreifuss (Social Democratic Party) stepped down and Pascal Couchepin (Liberal Democratic Party) took over the Department for Home Affairs whilst health and accident insurance were shifted to the Federal Office for Public Health. Things changed drastically within the commissions and publication of the pek findings, which were very supportive of complementary medicine, was prevented. The Forum - re - named \u00abForum for Holistic Medicine\u00bb (fo - rum f\u00fcr ganzheitsmedizin, or ffg) - had by then wisely prepared a popular initiative for the consideration of complementary medicine in all areas of public healthcare and, by mid-September 2005, was able to present to parliament a petition with around 140,000 signatures. After its initial rejection by the govern - ment and the National Council, the constitu - tional article soon found support from both houses and even from the government after a counter-proposal (\u00aba future with comple - mentary medicine\u00bb) was smartly submitted to the Council of States. In the memorable referendum of 17 May 2009, 67 per cent of voters as well as all the Cantons consented with a surprisingly clear majority. This prob - ably first establishment of complementary medicine in a state constitution attracted worldwide attention. It forms the founda - tion for the implementation of the referen - dum's comprehensive demands which were fully accepted with the counter-proposal.The work continues Since this major success, for which much effort and money was needed, the ffg and the former initiative committee have merged to form the umbrella organization for complementary medicine, Dakomed. With the financial support from its 14 mem - bers and 35 support organizations as well as donations from the people this association has made every effort over the last eight years to realize its intentions in all areas of public healthcare - an endeavour that has already proved successful at various levels. With the government resolution of 16 June 2017 - just one day before anthrosana cel - ebrated its fortieth anniversary - its central aim has become reality. On 1 August - Swiss National Day! - An - throposophic Medicine has gained uncon - ditional and unlimited parity with main - stream medicine and the cost of medical provisions will definitely be covered by the statutory health insurance: a success that will hopefully radiate out into the world from the heart of Europe. | Herbert Holliger, Arlesheim ( ch) anthroposophy worldwide Contact h.holliger@sunrise.chSwitzerland: Complementary Medicine established in constitution Equality of Anthroposophic Medicine Since 1 August 2017 the provisions of Anthroposophic Medicine, classical homeopathy, phytotherapy and Traditional Chinese Medicine have been definitely included in the mandatory health insurance in Switzerland - a highlight for anthroposophy worldwide. Yes to Complementary Medicine: submitting signatures in Bern ( ch) on 15 September 2005 Herbert Holliger was administrator of anthrosana from 1986 to 2012, co-found - er and co-president of the predecessor organizations of Dakomed, and a com - mittee member of the popular initiative \u00abYes to Complementary Medicine\u00bb.4 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 9/17 school of spiritual science An overriding theme of the conference con - sisted in considering how the idea of Youth Bonds might constitute a practical way in which humanity can find a path from a beguiling but misconceived capitalistic economic thinking to an associative para - digm, in which everyone who has initiative can be capitalized. Capital for initiatives Youth Bonds are characterized by the ges - ture of providing capital for entrepreneurs for new initiatives on terms set out by them and affordable for them. Many societal con - cerns are thereby addressed in this appar - ently simple concept: facilitating young people to take hold of their life circumstanc - es, developing financial literacy, allocat - ing surplus capital in a socially productive way, promoting initiative and sovereignty. We discussed different versions of the Youth Bond idea that had been tried, from Argentina to Folkestone, and other vehicles, for example through the Anthroposophi - cal Society creating a fund available for youth initiative and replenished from the loans being repaid in the course of time. This brought up not only the question of some of the [technical] restrictions of operating a Youth Bond but also some principle concerns about the right way to make decisions about allocating funds, whether by committees, according to written criteria, or based on the author - ity of the user. As tempting as it appears to set conditions in stone, often succes - sor fund administrators do not share the karmic intentions of the fund founders. The financing of initiative is a sine-qua- non of economic development and is in - creasingly contingent upon there being a culture of financial literacy both on the part of the users and of the lenders of such funds. Karmic accounting The special place of accounting in eco - nomics has often been noted within the Economics Conference (and occasionally elsewhere). A further dimension was ex - plored in link to the various references and analogies Rudolf Steiner makes between accounting and karma ( ga 95, Lecture of 27 August 1906). Becoming accountable means taking responsibility for one's ac - tions and preparing to sense its conse - quences, not just in the general sense but the specific sense of using accounts to make visible one's will and then to anticipate how the consequences of the path one chooses become discernible in the etheric. Finance as Guardian The question of the threshold as a societal phenomenon was also encompassed. It be - came of special significance in the year 1917 when humanity's crossing of the threshold in the nineteenth century came to effective expression. One can also understand from external history that 1917 was the year in which humanity had a new possibility to link with its will life, to take responsibility for economic life, which had hitherto been directed from outside. From that point on, economic life became independent of rights life and needed to be taken hold of as such. 1917 was the year in which Steiner first be - gan taking initiatives in connection with the threefold nature of social life; the historical context of this is linked to the First World War and where the responsibility for it lay. Meeting in Folkestone allowed us to consider where in the English psyche the question of the causes of the WW1 stands and what chance there is now for the mood of forgiveness to arise so that the growing pains of the twentieth century can be seen in a new light. Economics Conference Fund The Economics Conference Fund ( ecf) is now held among 12 accounts in different Societies around the world and denominated in the Hibernia (a notional unit of account equiv - alent to the Swiss Franc). There are three aspects to the funding of the ecf : adminis - tration, publications, and website manage - ment. The substance of the work itself is increasingly characterised by a gesture of coherence. | Arthur Edwards, Folkestone ( gb)Trying to understand capital: members of the Economics Conference in Folkestone. Section for Social Sciences: Economics Conference Funding initiative Understanding the way in which capital arises and is allocated could be described as the leitmotif of the Economics Conference culture. It is this understanding that distinguishes an associative approach from others. The meeting of 21 to 25 June 2017 in Folkestone (gb) looked, among other things, at the funding of initiatives, in particular initiatives of young people, and at different ways of taking responsibility for the economic life.

Thanks to the imagination it often pur - sues unexpected new paths. What kind of reader is prepared to follow these paths? As Felix Philipp Ingold wrote in a Zurich newspaper (Neue Z\u00fcricher Zeitung) on 18 May 2017, \u00abThe majority of people who still take notice of poetry is probably almost identical with the minority of those who write poetry\u00bb. Yet it is true to say that we can have ex - periences with language: we are involved in language when we listen, read, speak, write. And we can try to share our reading experiences with others. The danger of knowing too much It all started in Almut Bockem\u00fchl's sitting room in Dornach ( ch) in December 1989. We heard of similar meetings in Salem at Lake Constance ( de), with Emily and Tilman Feuchtinger, and in Stuttgart ( de). In 1991 the groups came together for a conference on the German poet Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin. As early as thirty years ago, these initially monthly meetings turned into colloquia on the Language in Poetry, taking place twice yearly, in spring at the Goetheanum and in autumn in Salem, in the Feuchtinger's literary and welcoming home. Around ten to twenty people take part each time. Dealing with additional knowledge about an author and his poem can be a challenge. It can be helpful and instructive, but often it rather prevents access and makes people listen less carefully to their reading. We aim to remain as close as possible to the text. This is not always easy, par - ticularly with contemporary poems such as those by Paul Celan, in whose work we found the title of this article. Modern poetry can be particularly challenging to read, because we have to unfold what has been condensed into sparse language; at the same time we must not lose sight of the multiple layers and carefully examine individually discovered and not only general or symbolic images. Communal efforts can be helpful. The diversity and change of perspectives and interpretations lead to experiences that one would not have by oneself. This hap - pens fairly regularly and these are happy moments. But it is never easy to leave be - hind a perspective one has assumed and make place for others. In May this year sixteen people spent a weekend at the Goetheanum, studying Goethe's poetic cycle West-East Divan, in particular The Book of H\u00e0fiz, the Persian poet discovered by Goethe, and The Book of the Parsi. In earlier years we had studied The Book of Zuleika from the same cycle. The West-East Divan was the culmination of Goethe's lifelong fascination with orien - tal, mainly Arabic, culture, the Quran and the Old Testament. \u00abWho knows himself and others well / No longer may ignore: / Occident and Orient dwell / Separately no more.\u00bb 1 Goethe's concern struck us as utterly topical. Poets, cycles, themes We usually focus on one poet during each meeting and have for some years now de - voted ourselves to more extensive composi - tions and cycles, including Rainer Maria Ril - ke's Duino Elegies or his Sonnets to Orpheus, the late Hymns of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, or Paul Celan's Breath Crystal. Occasionally we decide on a particular theme such as \u00abNa - Rudolf Bind, Arlesheim ( ch)Humanities Section: Colloquium on Language in Poetry Hei, Chebeldei, Chebeldei The Colloquium on Language in Poetry, organized by the Humanities Section at the Goetheanum, goes back almost thirty years.

Poems with \u00abNotes and Essays\u00bb Title of the first edition, engraved by Carl Ermer in copper 6 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 9/17 We met to address the problem of over - specialisation in science, taking as our focus themes from evolutionary biology. Human beings gain specialised concepts and perspectives from experiences. For ex - ample it is possible to imagine the different perspectives of a geologist, a real estate broker or a soldier on studying a landscape. These specialists might see diverse pos - sibilities for using the land such as mining operations, housing developments or troop movements, while long-term residents of the same landscape may view all these as detrimental. But when ideas are not fixed, human beings can increase the mobility and versatility of thinking by working with others and can become a vessel for new ideas and discoveries.1 The subjects of focus: archetype, ancestor, novelty Archetype: Practitioners of Goethean sci - ence often speak of the archetype but our work showed its meaning was not completely clear and had changed over the course of history. The first step was to address our different mental pictures and experiences of archetypes. These were connected with our biographies, interests and fields of work and thus loaded with subjectivity and open to misunderstanding. It needed much patience to carefully re- phrase our ideas and craft more precise com - munication. In the process we discovered a new dynamic, changing concept of arche - type, both timeless and time-inhabiting. Ancestor: Since Charles Darwin and his early followers popularised the idea of common ancestry, the biosciences placed much emphasis on hereditary lines, pre - senting them as phylogenetic trees2. Our group felt such emphasis on past history overshadowed the experience of species as phenomena in the present, with all their future possibilities. Novelty: For evolutionary biologists, nov - elty is a tricky concept.3 A crucial question is can completely new things ever arise and how far are they really rearrangements of pre-existing entities. To our experience, novelty was always associated with some form of pre-existence. We considered a number of apparently novel situations: for example feathers in birds and the activity of Man. In all examples discussed, the level of re-organisation of pre-existing foundations was completely unpredictable and involved a radical saltation from a previous into a new state, with a large increase in possible future developments. Phenomenological investigations In every specialised discipline, the form and spirit of questioning creates a context constraining the answers. We overcame this challenge by exposing ourselves to a range of different phenomena. Our stud - ies included: Demonstrations of water dynamics. These supplied images of perpetual, dynamic movement and metamorphic responsive - ness similar to the fluidity of living organ - isms and transformative currents of evo - lutionary development. A demonstration showing the differences in blood movements in the hearts of dif - ferent vertebrate groups. An experience of the \u00abtimeless archetype\u00bb concept through intuitive perception of form, a method used in dowsing practices. Our dowsing colleague demonstrated how human beings have an awareness of form that goes beyond sense perception. Archetypal forms in metamorphic expres - sion were observed in the skull forms of a variety of bird species. An impressive metaphor for evolutionary development came from a description of an actual journey through different Euro - pean locations, with a craft activity at each location. The journey was compared to an evolutionary pathway, leading out of the past, meeting the future but always indi - viduating at each stopping point, through creative practice. The Archaeopteryx These shared experiences prepared the group for a study of an iconic evolution - ary problem: the fossil Archaeopteryx, an extinct bird, provided by Bristol University palaeontological collections. The first near-complete specimen of Ar - chaeopteryx, with feather impressions, was discovered near Langenaltheim, Germany in 1861, two years after the publication of Darwin's Origins of Species, while the world was raging with discussions on the possi - bilities of species changing one into another. So this strange bird with reptilian features appeared at a time of transformation in thinking. For the 21st Century mind, steeped in Darwinism, it is hard to understand the impact of such a radical change in ideas, in which species were potentially able to transform into new forms. Archaeopteryx was seen as a connecting link between two animal groups: reptiles and birds, because it clearly possessed bird- like features (e.g. wings, flight feathers, furcula or wishbone, partially opposable hallux or big toe, long narrow shoulder Natural Science Section: An experiment in collaborative research Archetypes, ancestors and novelty in evolution From 17 to 19 May a research colloquium took place at the Ruskin Mill Field Centre to study biological evolution. The group consisted of seven representatives from philoso - phy and meditative practice, medicine, hydrodynamic research, dowsing, education and evolutionary biology, all with experience of the Goethean method.Archaeopteryx: the unique identity of an organism Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 9/17 | 7 The magician on the donkey Our meditative work invited a being of in - spiration, a spiritual entelechy, to embody itself in the group dynamic. We conjured the image of the magician-philosopher, rid - ing backwards on a donkey. As we trace the ancestral paths of animal or plant species in the flow of evolutionary time, the magician can look back on the path he has taken but his future trajectory is not completely pre - determined and remains full of possibilities. This image may be found in folk tales (e.g. from Turkey and China). The magician is suspended between past and future but is his own individualised self in time, express - ing an archetype that actively presences itself at each moment. For us, this symbol became the metaphor for evolutionary change. | Judyth Sassoon, Bristol ( gb) anthroposophical society blades) and reptilian features (e.g. a long tail supported by about 23 vertebrae, teeth with continual replacement, gastralia or belly ribs, unfused pelvic bones e.g. pubis and ischium). Even though Archaeopteryx is often said to be a transitional or intermediate form, it is not really so, if by transitional we mean all its features were somewhere between reptiles and birds. Creatures such as Archaeopteryx were rather more like mosaics4 in which some characters were retained from a past history (ances - tral characters), while others were novel, anticipating possible future trajectories. And very importantly, some characters were unique to that animal living in its particular time. Coexisting three levels of time The three levels of time-dynamics past, present and future coexist in every spe - cies. In Archaeopteryx the axial skeleton (i.e. skull and backbone) was more reptilian, so retained more of the past. In contrast, the motor organisation and extremities (wings, flight feathers, legs) tended to be the regions developing novelties. So the forelimbs looked to the future while the deeper structures remained conserved. Where the two functional systems (axial skeleton and limbs) interpenetrated was where the more individualised characters could be found (e.g. hips). However, to fragment Archaeopteryx into characters either reptilian or avian, and to ascribe more importance to some over others, could not present the reality of this creature. The unique identity of an organism becomes lost if too much empha - sis is placed on causality and ancestry. Our observations and the group meditation that followed, facilitated an experience of how a living creature constantly brings itself into being through its own processes: creating, recreating and maintaining itself in the stream of its own lifetime. When that impulse dies, the processes metamor - phose into something else. The pattern of activity of this organism could be experi - enced as its own, integrated heterochronic state. Archaeopteryx was no more or less a transitional form than my own mother, in her hereditary position between my maternal grandparents and me. Having known my mother, I would find it difficult to dismiss her as intermediate. 1 Rudolf Steiner: The relation of the diverse branches of Natural Science to Astronomy (ga 323), Lecture 1st January, 1921, Stuttgart. 2 Phylogenetic tree: A branching diagram showing inferred evolutionary relationships between organism species or higher groupings such as classes or genera.

This term is used in palae- ontology to denote the evolution of characters at various rates within and between species. The linear representations of evolutionary trajectories are misleading. There are always many possible routes for evolution to take, which can only be studied in retrospect. These routes disclose the dynamic of animal form with environment. Organisms must be seen as interpenetrating fields of vital activity influenc- ing and being influenced by their environmen - tal situation and evolving together with it. Drawing by Zhang GualaoLondon: Conference on the Foundation Stone Meditation A contemporary call to the human soul From 28 to 29 October 2017 the second au- tumn conference on the Foundation Stone Meditation will take place at Rudolf Steiner House in London, hosted by the General Section of the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain. The meditation, which can be considered as a spiritual basis of the anthroposophical movement, was given by Rudolf Steiner as a renewal of the ancient call: \u00abHuman Being Know Thyself.\u00bb The meditation pres - ents this call in a way that is appropriate to the consciousness of the contemporary human being. Everyone can work with the meditation in their own way. One can study its content, work with its rhythms, medi - tate on certain words or phrases, or simply speak the words silently or aloud, thereby becoming increasingly sensitive to the spiritual reality of one's own human nature. In this conference we will seek to get to know and experience our own human nature within the greater spiritual world around us. Mindful that it was in 1917 that Rudolf Steiner first described the threefold nature of the human soul, we will now, in 2017, focus on the three distinctive calls of \u00abHuman Soul!\u00bb and practise spirit recalling, spirit sensing, and spirit beholding, so as to become more inwardly active in taking responsibility for our lives and actions. There will be short contributions, dis - cussions in smaller groups, exercises, eu - rythmy and speech.

In connection with the three specialist con - ferences that have taken place so far and the fourth, which will be held on 3 and 4 November 2017 at the Rudolf Steiner Schule in Bochum-Landendreer ( de), the \u00f6ffentlich wirken initiative has also asked itself how these projects can be funded. Up until now, the organizer, Thon Marketing, has had to bear the sole financial responsibility. For this reason a friends' association has now been founded which aims at establish - ing links between public welfare oriented institutions and provide further training for them because, as it says in the preamble to the association's bylaws, \u00abthe association believes that activities which are concerned with public welfare will promote civil-soci - ety commitment and therefore human and societal development\u00bb.| Sebastian J\u00fcngelThe ensemble first performed in the capi - tal, Kathmandu, at the Rastriya Naach Ghar (National Dance Theatre). Thanks to the organizers, the Kevin Rohan Memorial Eco Foundation ( krmef ), the auditorium was filled twice: there was a performance for children in the afternoon and an eve - ning performance for adults. The pro - gramme with speech and music was very diverse, and the Indian folktale \u00abBhakta Dhruva\u00bb (child of the North star) turned out the be the audience favourite! Festival of encounters The bus journey to Pokhara was a real adventure. With an average speed of not more than 20 kilometres per hour on roads some of which were mere tracks, we took a whole day to cover a distance of 200 ki - lometres. We stayed at Maitreya Pathsha - la, a Waldorf farm school that overlooks the snow-capped Himalayan mountains. The performance was in the town cen - tre, in quite a small but very beautiful and atmospheric theatre. Thanks to our local organizer, Rittmann Gurung, the audito - rium was filled to the last seat: 500 children had come to see the folktale. The final performance was held again in the auditorium of the Rastriya Naach Ghar, this time organized by Shanti Sewa Griha, a home for lepers, home - less people, people with disabilities and orphans, which was founded and is under the direction of Marianne Gro\u00dfpietsch from Germany. The auditorium was full of children and adults from Shanti and Nepal's minister of health attended as a guest of honour. The outstanding eurythmy performance was framed by artistic demonstrations presented by Shanti children. It was simply beau - tiful, a great festival of encounters. A well-rehearsed team The twelve members of the Light Eu - rythmy Ensemble are excellent in how they present this art. The well-rehearsed team can set up the stage in no time. Stage curtains, a stage floor and even lighting equipment they bring with them on the plane from Switzerland. Their aim is to carry eurythmy into the world, to bring the light of this art to foreign countries, particularly to poor countries where people would other - wise not have the opportunity to experi - ence the art of eurythmy. The Light Eurythmy Ensemble has the task to disperse light into the world ether and, by doing so, deepen the an - throposophical activity in the countries they visit. I would also like to thank my sister, Dilnawaz Bana, for taking the initiative to bring eurythmy to Nepal. | Aban Bana, Mumbai ( in)The \u00f6ffentlich wirken (on the topic of \u00abshowing strength\u00bb) will take place on 3 and 4 November 2017 in Bochum Nepal: Light Eurythmy Ensemble Light into the world ether From 29 May to 8 June 2017 the Arlesheim Light Eurythmy Ensemble ( ch) went on a tour of Nepal, presenting eurythmy performances for the first time ever in Kathmandu, Dakshinkali and Pokhara. In addition to the artistic demonstrations on stage, members of the ensemble also gave workshops. The Light Eurythmy Ensemble in Nepal: eurythmy workshop at the Tashi Waldorf School in Kathmandu Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 9/17 | 9 It almost looked as if there would be no mystery drama performances at all for us this year. For six years we had worked on them, putting in ever greater efforts; first on individual scenes, then one drama after the other; two years ago the first three dramas within one week and finally, last year, the fourth drama. All performances were enhanced between acts by Lennart Nilo's beautiful music. With the exception of a few main parts all actors were amateurs - up to fifty people who devoted much of their free time to this basically impossible project. Unconventional compromises Then a bombshell after the 2016 perfor - mances: Hans Lindmark, who had inspired and directed the plays and played the part of Benedictus, declared that he was leaving now that all four dramas had been per - formed. Continuing the work without him seemed impossible, particularly since many of the actors also decided it was time to stop. But could we just give up? Had we not given birth to a child that now needed look -ing after? And had not Michael Debus, who had carried the work with us right from the start with his series of lectures, already de - veloped a proposal for their continuation? What had first seemed impossible sud - denly took shape. Our producer, Ulrike von Schoultz, again proved her strength of ini - tiative. A new Benedictus and a new Maria were found who were prepared to learn an enormous amount of lines in addition to their daily jobs. The directing was shared between a small group. The smaller parts were filled during the year, some only a few weeks before the performance. We did not even shrink from unconventional compromises: the producer played Marie K\u00fchne, the lighting technician was Michael Edelmann - that was not only original, but artistically very successful. And what other country society can boast to have seen its general secretary and chairman on stage in the same scene - and to such good effect? Special inspiration Working with Paul Klarskov for a weekend in spring proved very inspiring. The Danish actor and director has years of experience with the Mystery Dramas and is bubbling over with ideas for putting them on stage. The two scenes we worked on with him clearly stood out from the others, but they indirectly affected the rest of the plays be - cause they gave us the courage to overcome our individual boundaries. At Michael Debus' suggestion we per - formed scenes from all four dramas this year, focusing on Johannes' path of develop - ment. That this path is about an encounter with Anthroposophia is reflected in the con - ference title, \u00abAnthroposophy. The journey of a being.\u00bb Because the feminine element in human evolution is an essential part of this journey, Michael Debus was able to refer to motifs from his book Maria Sophia (2000), which came out in Swedish in 2017. Eurythmy included It was good that I only had a small part be - cause it meant that I could focus on my addi - tional role as prompter. My services were not often required, however, because the actors mastered their lines very well indeed - al - though southerners say of us that we are not properly grounded here in the north, particularly around St John's Tide. Anyway, I had plenty of opportunity to admire my wonderful colleagues and to enjoy the eu - rythmy. The birth of eurythmy is connected with the history of the Mystery Dramas and the eurythmy scenes had been central to our work from day one. It was therefore only logical that this year's conference con - cluded with a eurythmy performance about the \u00abfairy tales\u00bb in the Mystery Dramas. Of course there were difficulties on the way. The archaic language of the present Swedish translation was difficult, not only for the audience, and some of us were not always able to project their untrained voices to the very back of the auditorium. Many people have enjoyed coming to the Cultural Centre in J\u00e4rna every year at St John's Tide to attend the Mystery Drama Conferences. And seeing as we have perse - vered for seven years now we have come to believe that we may as well go on next year. | J\u00fcrgen Vater, J\u00e4rna ( se) Six years of growing efforts: poster motif from Scene 2 of The Soul's Probation Contact jurgen.vater@telia.comSweden: Mystery Drama Conference \u00abAnthroposophy.

Ett v\u00e4sen p\u00e5 sin v\u00e4g.10 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 9/17 There had been an Anthroposophical So - ciety in New Zealand newsletter since the early days of the Society. For many years this came out in a monthly typed version that was copied and mailed. In addition to the newsletters there was an annual publica - tion of greater depth articles. Today, the An - throposophical Society in New Zealand has three distinct but interconnected newslet - ters that utilize a range of different media. 1. Each year the Society publishes a siz - able magazine in hard copy that is circu - lated to members but also to the wider anthroposophical community. Called Sphere it was established in 2000 but the first full magazine with coloured cov - er came out in December 2009. Sphere carries predominantly long form es - says covering a wide range of subjects. 2. The second publication is Scope and this is published in hard copy three times a year. It is sent to members of the Society in the post but also by email as a pdf for those who prefer a soft copy. A recent survey of our members found that only 64 enjoy the hard copy version but they are steadfast and committed readers who spend many hours perusing the articles in Scope so although there are not many of them they are dedicated receivers of this newsletter! About 75% of the contents of Scope is then published as individual posts on our blog, which is an adjunct to our website: www.anthroposophy.org.nz 3. In conjunction with Scope we also distribute an e-newsletter called Ardent. In some form, Ardent has been running for 8 years but in the last year it has had a change in its look and feel, and in its mandate. Currently, Ardent is very like a contents page from a traditional hard-copy magazine. It gives a snippet of each article then links to that story online so readers can explore the magazine by following the stories of particular interest to them. All our publications work to deliver on our Society's three core directions: Outreach, Support of initiatives and Connecting to the 21st Century. | Sue Simpson, general sec - retary of the Anthroposophical Society ( nz) Originally an in-house journal published by the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain for its members, New View came into being at Michaelmas 1996. When I became its editor in November 1998 my intention was to take Rudolf Steiner's world-view - particularly concerning esoteric Christianity and the elemen - tal world - and what it inspires today in people and initiatives and make it better known to a wider public, not just in the uk but throughout the English speaking world. I firmly believe that New View's content is of immense value for these difficult times in which we are living, particularly in en - couraging knowledge of spiritual realities underpinning and informing our material world. Articles written by an international pool of authors regularly feature esoteric Christianity, science, art, education, current affairs, inner development and much more. In 2004 New View became independent of the Society and today we exist solely on income from subscriptions, advertising and, vitally, donations from our readers. New View is published quarterly to coin - cide with the Christian festivals of Christ - mas, Easter, St. John's Tide and Michaelmas. Its readership stretches across Anthropo - sophical Society members, those connected to various anthroposophy-inspired initia - tives and the general public. The entire production (editing, typeset - ting, graphics, etc.) is done by the New View team of Rosemary Usselman and myself. One task as editor is to ensure that articles are of universal relevance and importance, another is to filter out authors' use of an- thro-speak - terminology only understood by anthroposophists - and offer content that can be understood by those not so familiar with Steiner's concepts. Each quarter we sell around 1500 printed magazines in over 40 countries, but the actu - al readership is much larger as bought issues of New View are generously shared around! In the autumn of 2016 we launched a digital version of the magazine, not only to move with the times but also to make New View more affordable for people subscribing from abroad. Take up for this grows slowly, but the printed- paper version remains the most popular. Our wish? To have funds for a marketing budget to reach more folk and increase our circulation. | Tom Raines, New View ( uk) antroposophical society Sphere Printed. One annual edition. For members and friends.

The discussion was prompted by a motion suggesting that the initiative Ein Nachrichtenblatt should be given the space to introduce itself in Anthroposophy Worldwide. Another member pro - posed to include a list of existing newssheets in every edition of Anthroposophy Worldwide. Since this would take up too much space in every edition it was decided to take up the suggestion to have individual newsletters introducing themselves.

[...] Only when the kind of spirituality that permeates the anthroposophical move - ment unites with other spiritual streams, Michael will find the impulses that will reunite him with the intelligence that has become part of the earth but really belongs to him.\u00bb ( ga 237) The Youth Section under J\u00f6rgen Smit This preparation fell to a gen - eration of people who would reach middle age by the turn of the century. They first came together early in 1979 in Kings Langley ( gb). This initiative, to - gether with other streams, led to the foundation of the Youth Section under J\u00f6rgen Smit. We met thinking that we wanted to get to know each other at a young age so that we would be able to work together at the end of the century and not fall out as it had happened repeatedly in the history of the society.1 In 1981 J\u00f6rgen Smit ap - pointed the first Youth Section Collegium2 for a period of two years. Many of its members oc - cupy leading positions today. Also in 1979, the first Mich - aelmas Conference took place, inspired by Manfred Schmidt-Brabant. This conference was to take place every seven years up until the year 2000, accom - panying the preparations for the millennium. At our urgent request J\u00f6rgen Smit began to initiate the re - newal of the School of Spiritual Science which would open up new possibilities for inner work. Some inherited problems could also be solved: for instance when more than 1200 urns, which had accumulated in the Goetheanum, were buried. The first burial took place before sun - rise on 9 November 1989 - the day the Berlin Wall came down. Opening up Another event, which was main - ly promoted by Goetheanum co- workers around Martin Barkhoff, was the Open Day. The first pub - lic open day took place in 1988. Further events consolidated the Goetheanum's position as a centre in and for the public sphere: in 1995, for instance, Johannes Wirz organized an international conference with Ifgene, gathering \u00abgreen\u00bb and conventional scientists around a table for a sharing of views. Other events, of the Goethea - num Branch for example, with George Ritchie and Yonasan Gershom, were equally success - ful, but it also turned out that the Goetheanum's international renown was not strong enough to allow for a meeting between Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker and V\u00e1clav Havel (they politely declined). Further attempts to achieve a greater opening of the Goetheanum - for in - stance an invitation to the Da -The culmination of anthroposophy The older generation has experience, the younger impulses Andreas Heertsch describes how, in his view, the culmination of anthroposophy was prevented at the end of the last century. With his contribution he wishes to inspire a wider discussion on the subject. anthroposophy worldwide Germany: Fritz Fuchs book project Carried by colour A major monographic survey is being put together on Fritz Fuchs, a painter from J\u00e4rna (se), who designed colour schemes for buildings all over Europe. The designer Fritz Fuchs (born 1937), who lives in Sweden, has devoted his entire life to the research and practical imple - mentation of Rudolf Steiner's thoughts on the use of colour in architecture. In 50 years of indefatigable work, inspired by the cultural impulse of J\u00e4rna ( se) and his encounter with the art - ist Arne Klingborg (1915 - 2005), he created around 250 proj - ects - including many design objects - in more than ten Euro - pean countries. The buildings in question are characterized by a special Nordic colourfulness and include sports arenas, tube sta - tions, hospitals, nursing homes, universities, a one-mile wall of a prison hospital, bridges, Wal - dorf schools, factories, heat and power stations, lidos, housing developments, underground carparks, laundry shops - wher - ever colour was needed. The jury for the International Colour De - sign Award, which Fritz Fuchs received in 1984, praised the \u00abimmensely differentiated use of three scales of transparent colours\u00bb and the \u00abcolour spaces\u00bb thus created. Radiance, luminescence, shine For Fritz Fuchs, there is no bet - ter way of facilitating dialogue between colours and materials used in buildings than lazuring; because \u00abtransparent colour has the rare quality of being just colour without having to pretend to be something else. At the same time it does not hide the materiality with which it has entered into a relationship\u00bb. The high - and still rare - art For information or to offer sup - port please contact: mochner. matthias@berlin.deof colour lazuring brings out qualities that are similar to the experience of a rainbow: the ra - diance, luminescence and shine it generates carry us and make us feel safe. The planned pub - lication will provide an overall experience of Fritz Fuchs' work. | Matthias Mochner, Mathis Lohl, Berlin ( de)12 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 9/17 lai Lama - failed because of the reluctance of the Goetheanum leadership (\u00abWishful thinking\u00bb). At the same time energy- consuming internal conflicts erupted around the publication of the class lessons, the reno - vation of the Main Auditorium and eventually around the group that called itself Gelebte Weih - nachtstagung (living Christmas Conference). And yet, the Wal - dorf movement, biodynamic farming, anthroposophic medi - cine and special needs educa - tion had an astonishingly good, though not uncontroversial, rep - utation in public. Everything was set for the culmination to begin. Signs of a culmination In 1984 the German weekly Der Spiegel featured a six-part, well- researched series on anthro - posophy which was later also published as a book (Rowohlt Press). These articles, composed by the renowned journalist Ernst Hess (writing under his nom de plume, Peter Br\u00fcgge) were reluctantly positive about anthroposophy. This peace soon ended, how - ever, when the mother of a class seven student at the Vrije School in Zutphen (NL) expressed her \u00abdisconcertment\u00bb with passag - es in Rudolf Steiner's work that could be seen as racist. Jutta von Dithfurt and others soon made this accusation public. In 1998 a book entitled Schwarzbuch Anthroposophie disparaged Ru - dolf Steiner as a racist. The fact that this \u00abblack book\u00bb was soon banned only served to call more attention to it and increased the \u00abhype\u00bb and public uncertainty about anthroposophy. At the time the Goetheanum leaders omitted to publish a clear response (\u00abWe don't talk to people who think Rudolf Steiner was racist.\u00bb) The Anthroposoph - ical Society in the Netherlands demonstrated what such a re - sponse could have looked like when it commissioned non- anthroposophists to judge the passages in question. The Barda Enquiry came to the conclusion that from today's point of view twelve of the passages in ques - tion could be seen as racist. Effective accusation of racism The lack of response from the Goetheanum led to the impres - sion that \u00abanthroposophists are not open to conversation.\u00bb In an attempt to prove this wrong I invited practising Jews and a Protestant professor, a com - mitted defender of Jews, for a panel discussion at the Goethea - num. The latter said to me en passant, \u00abIf you didn't defend Steiner so passionately, we wouldn't feel so tempted to attack you\u00bb. While the event helped to calm down the lo - cal press, I was asked internally why on earth I invited \u00absuch people\u00bb to the Goetheanum. People were up in arms be - cause a professor of theology had failed to fully quote a cru - cial passage in Rudolf Steiner's work by leaving out a qualify - ing statement added by Steiner in the next sentence. We had, however, agreed to exchange manuscripts and so I was able to fill in the missing information. Because the Goetheanum leaders refused to com - ment - no (thoroughly investi - gated) statement on the topic was published in time to pre - vent damage to Rudolf Steiner's reputation - the culmination of anthroposophy was prevented by this accusation of racism. Looking for reasons It is relatively easy to judge these events from the dis - tance we have today. It would probably have been cleverer politically not to promote the bizarre \u00abblack book\u00bb by banning it and to publish instead a state - ment from the Goetheanum on the incriminated passages. There are various reasons why the necessary historical distance to Rudolf Steiner was not pos - sible at the time. Then, as now, the Goetheanum suffered from the fact that it attracts souls in search of an authority they can blindly trust. These people see anyone as a heretic who does not accept that Rudolf Steiner is an initiate. Those who have direct experience of this influ - ence will understand that the Goetheanum leaders at the time were unwilling to distance themselves as a Society. But the prevented culmina - tion is more than a leadership problem. At the 2015 Michael - mas Conference some members of the first Youth Section Col - legium met again - some after not having seen each other for years. We agreed that we had failed. I suppose every genera - tion that judges its successes in relation to the decisions taken before birth will come to the same conclusion. And yet: real - izing our ideals is our noblest task as human beings.3 What the outcome will be, not even the loftiest spirits can predict. I would like to end this retro - spection with one of the best experiences I had when I was on the council of the Goetheanum Branch: Nana Goebel, Martin Barkhoff and I joined this coun - cil in 1983 and suggested to the chairman, Kurt Franz David, that we should take the daring step of offering conversations. Af - ter being sceptical initially he agreed. Two conversations then took place: the first was wholly inspiring, the second disastrous: people insisted on having their say to whom usually no one wanted to listen. To this day I admire Kurt Franz David's views on old and young working together: \u00abA new broom sweeps clean, but an old broom knows where the dirt is\u00bb. Or to put it less crudely, the older generation has the experience, the younger the impulses. | Andreas Heertsch, Arlesheim ( ch) 1 We unfortunately did not always manage that. 2 The other members were (left to right in the picture): Claudia Grah Hilbert and Michael Knaak. 3 Ideals are often perceived as being \u00abthe only way forward\u00bb. In his Philosophy of Freedom Rudolf Steiner developed the stages every ideal has to be subjected to: moral imagination and moral technique.

And how unnecessary. In 1923, when he re-founded the Anthroposophical Society Rudolf Steiner naturally gave expression to the financial di - mension of that deed. Statute 12 reads, \u00abMember - ship dues shall be fixed by the individual groups; each group shall, however, submit 15 Swiss Francs for each of its members to the central leadership of the Society at the Goetheanum.\u00bb This, Steiner said, should be enough for the budget of the General Society. Updated us - ing information supplied by the Swiss National Bank, that amount today would be 90 chf / Hibernias1 - a factor of 6. On the recently reported member - ship base of close on 45,000 (all figures from Anthroposophy Worldwide 4/17), this would amount to 4,050,000 Hibernias. The Society is funded In 2016 the cost for the Soci - ety and School combined was 14,944,000 Hibernias, of which 4,191,000 (28%) was met from membership contributions and free donations, meaning that overall we are actually already meeting the sum updated from 1923. The problem is that it is not evenly, fairly or consciously car - ried by the membership at large. This sum need not come from the members necessar - ily or directly. Although Ghandi once said that the best form of financing for a society such as ours was regular amounts from individual human beings, because every such act is one of renewed will and conscious intent, the will of the mem - bers should not be presumed or pressed upon. Its best effect arises when it is freely expressed. Steiner's genius lies in oblig - ing the daughters (i.e. the Groups or Country Societies) to support their mother, but leaving them, and therefore the members in general, free. But there is more. Such a sum as 4,050,000 Hibernias not only meets the day-to-day needs of the Society, it could also have a siphoning or leveraging ef - fect on the monies needed to finance the work of the School - the latter understood in its largest sense as ranging from stage work to research of all kinds in the Sections. Likened to modern business precepts, membership income could be seen as covering the risk implicit in the work we ini - tiate as a movement - the eq- uity part of our liabilities, pro - viding the ground that enables humanity at large to join us in financing the debt part. To - gether, these two components finance our assets , namely, what (in allusion to Statute 2) we do for the benefit of human - ity as a whole on the ground of spiritual scientific insights into civilisation and practical life. Supporting the School of Spiritual Science On 31 December 1923, when discussing how much money would be needed to finance the work of the School, Steiner ob - served, \u00abWe should need noth - ing more than something like 50 to 75 million Francs; [though] I present this not as a wish, nor as a possibility, only as an illu - sion, albeit a very real illusion.\u00bb (ga 260) Multiplied by the fac - tor of 6, today this would be 300 to 450 million Hibernias2. In that connection, the idea was also discussed at that time, of a World Goetheanum As - sociation (not to be confused with the currently proposed Goetheanum Association). This was not taken up, however, and the closest to it since is proba - bly the Goetheanum Fund, cur - rently an activity of the Swiss Society but originally conceived as (and still capable of being) a concept for each and every country society. Obligations of the societies If every society did in fact seek support for the work of the School from society at large, not only would that work be strengthened and protected, because its relevance and merit would have been recognized by people generally, but the 450,000,000 Hibernias would also arise on a worldwide ba - sis - that is to say, not in one place but wherever the inner Goetheanum was active. In 2016 terms, that would mean the current 10,750,000 Hiber - nias for the Goetheanum at Dornach Hi - bernias for the Goetheanum beyond Dornach, with a large part of this probably coming from spend-out foundations, where this money currently otherwise gets stocked in fi - nancial markets. The question is whether the Anthroposophical Movement has reached the necessary ma - turity. Whether the Vorstand is prepared to oblige the Country Societies. Whether in turn the Country Councils are ready, will - ing and able to meet their obli - gations to the General Society. And whether the members can deepen their goodwill towards the Goetheanum. Above all, is it now possible for people to see \u00abthat fruitful work can be done out of Anthroposophy [such that] it might be pos - sible to say to them: ...maybe you are not interested now, but help us get it going and show what it can do.\u00bb [Speaking on 1 January 1924.] Necessary membership contribution The answer to these ques - tions - questions of leverage and world relevance - cannot be known, however, until the 90 per member is achieved. Currently that amount aver - ages a very uneven 75. Can we, therefore, find it in our hearts and will to increase this number, but also to carry it more widely? Surely the Good Spirits that ac - companied the Christmas Con - ference would not let such an effort on our part go unnoticed or unreciprocated. | Christopher Houghton Budd, Folkestone ( gb) 1 See Anthroposophy World - wide 3/2017, p. 16 where Chris- topher Houghton Budd de - scribed the concept of the Hibernia as a world currency rated 1:1 to the Swiss Franc. 2 Cast over the 10,000 institu- tions worldwide, this would be 45,000 Hibernias per institu - tion. As an economic calcula - tion, but not as a policy pro - posal, it would be interesting to know what that would be as a percentage of their turnover; that is, as if they were charged an intellectual property levy. Conversely, and more inter - estingly, it would be valuable to know by what amount, if any, their income would need to increase (become true?) in order to contribute such a sum. 14 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 9/17 antroposophical society 12 Nov. 1935 9 April 2017 Dorothea Hidber With Dorothea Hidber's pass - ing away the spiritual world receives a wealth of future- oriented will forces. Dorothea was born in Swit - zerland on 12 November 1935. The simple childhood years spent in post-war Europe would inform her entire life. After com - pleting teacher training in St Gallen ( ch) she applied to the aso , an organization of Swiss Schools overseas, and left the country to go to Chile. For a while Dorothea taught at the Colegio Suizo in Santiago, where she also started a fam - ily with the Swiss teacher and sculptor Urban Blank. After the birth of her third child she set up her first kindergarten in her own sitting room. The birth of her fourth child, Olivia, brought about a change in her life. She began to search for the spiritual sources of human existence. A new approach to life After many dramatic develop - ments Dorothea found her way to anthroposophy and to the first anthroposophical teacher training in Chile which, from 1977 and 1978, was led by Clau - dio Rauch. After graduating the mother-of-five became a kin - dergarten teacher in the newly founded Giordano Bruno Steiner School in Santiago. Dorothea changed her way of life completely. With her pro - nounced artistic talent she transformed her own home as well as the kindergarten into beautiful oases where every child felt at home. She was al - ways surrounded by children. She loved nature with all its phenomena and even the smallest of its beings and would introduce the children to its wonders. Ahead of her time, she would always look for ecological solutions. She did not need much - but all her daily activities were pervaded by her sense of beauty. A Chilean heart Chile became her home; she connected deeply with the country's destiny and its people and showed a great and loving interest in its nature. \u00abSwiss with a Chilean heart\u00bb she used to say. As a strong Swiss motif in her life she preserved her profound sense of freedom and independence, a quality that was not always understood by those around her because they were not familiar with it. She fostered her relationships with friends in Europe and with the Goetheanum by travelling there regularly. In 1983 she helped Rafael Gonz\u00e1lez to found Colegio Ru - dolf Steiner in Santiago. Later, she started a Waldorf kinder - garten in Pe\u00f1alol\u00e9n, a suburb of Santiago, and in the end she moved to Limache, not far from Valparaiso, in order to build up a Waldorf School there with Jorge G\u00f3mez and Angelica Val - lespir. She also gave the initial impulse for other kindergartens in the country. In 2006 we met Dorothea at the Ibero-American Education Congress in Punta de Tralca in Chile. I think of this wonderfully active and inspiring person with the deepest gratitude. | Clara Steinemann, Arlesheim ( ch)2 March 1928 4 August 17 Hellmuth ten Siethof Hellmuth ten Siethoff was born in Indonesia on 2 March 1928. He spent much time with the Indonesian servants in his pa - rental home, listening to their stories, observing their rituals and learning their language. \u00abI have an Indonesian ether body\u00bb, he would say later. His father, a lawyer, was Dutch and his mother, a pianist and violinist, was from Berlin. When the Japanese invaded In - donesia the family was separat - ed and taken to concentration- camp-style detention centres. At the age of 14 Hellmuth ten Siethoff felt responsible, not only to fight for his own life but also for that of his brother. After the war all family mem - bers, as by a miracle, came to - gether again unharmed and went to the Netherlands where Hellmuth had to catch up with the education he had missed. Economics, army, anthroposophy Hellmuth studied economics in Amsterdam and, not know - ing what to do next, joined the army. He said later that he knew everything that was needed there anyway - prob - ably not from his present life. He had great people skills and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant. At a New Year's ball he met his first wife with whom he would have three children. His wife's brother introduced him to anthroposophy. In 1958 he met the paediatrician Ber - nard Lievegoed and took on a leading position in the Dutch Institute for Education ( npi). Hellmuth ten Siethoff was a consultant for big enterprises and state institutions on various continents, working in organ - isational development, which for him meant developing a so - cial organism whilst awakening the individuality. He also gave countless courses on biography work, conflict resolution, three - foldness and anthropology. For many people his courses were a source of self-knowledge where they discovered creative ways of working together. His guiding impulse was the hu - man being as the end of all efforts and never as a means to an end. His loving, open-mined but structured approach was eye- opening. As a consultant he did not provide concepts but asked questions that made it possible for others to look at an enterprise or also at their own life with new eyes. Working with G\u00f6tz Werner Whether he worked for Shell, the Swiss authorities, whether in Dubai, Pakistan or S\u00e3o Paulo, he always followed the insights gained from anthroposophical spiritual science. \u00abAs above, so below\u00bb was his motto. He saw cooperation and biogra - phy as a reflection of spiritual hierarchies and spiritual laws of evolution. What was most fulfilling for him was his 18-year collabo - ration with the entrepreneur G\u00f6tz Werner in the German drugstore chain dm. Werner, he thought, \u00abunderstood every - thing immediately - and acted accordingly\u00bb. They spoke the same language.

Switzerland - Zimbabwe - France - Switzerland Hellmuth met his second wife, Erika, in 1970 and the couple moved to Switzerland. In 1995 they bought a house in Zim - babwe and lived there before moving to Provence ( fr). Back in Switzerland he gradu - ally developed dementia. With - out lamenting and with deep inner peace he allowed the outside world to fade away and looked towards the transi - tion to a future life, to living in the spiritual world to which he felt very close. Hellmuth ten Siethoff died on 4 August, at the age of 89, at R\u00fcttihubelbad, a nursing home near Bern ( ch), where he treated the many people he met with the same loving kindness that had distinguished him since his childhood. | Enno Schmidt, Basel fr) Anthroposophy Worldwide appears ten times a year, is distributed by the national Anthroposophical Societies, and appears as a supplement to the weekly Das Goetheanum Publisher General Anthroposophical Society, represented by Justus Wittich Editors Sebastian J\u00fcngel (responsible for this edi - tion ), Michael Kranawetvogl ( responsible for the Spanish edition ), Margot M.

Infectious diseases are often accom - panied by fever. The countless traumatized people we meet today are also in need of warmth. Cancer continues to be among the most frequent illnesses of our time requir - ing therapeutic stimulation of the warmth organization. And finally, warmth is also essential in end of life support. The quality and therapeutic effect of warmth clearly plays an important part throughout life. Warmth in medicine At the same time we continue to be faced with the limitations of therapy: antibi - otic treatment of infections has become one of the main causes of resistance to antibiotics and therefore their growing ineffectiveness. Despite all the progress being made, cancer therapies still come up against unresolved problems. The same is true for the medical and ethical issues arising around birth and death. This is why the Medical Section has chosen to give particular attention to the essence and therapeutic significance of warmth. We know, after all, about the posi - tive health effects of the anthroposophical approach to pregnancy, birth, early child - hood and to living with disabilities; there is evidence of the positive effect of restrict - ing the use of antibiotics, and studies have revealed the effectiveness of mistletoe as part of an integrative oncological therapy. Warmth in the social sphere This year, we also celebrate the centenary of Rudolf Steiner's publication on the three - fold social organism and of Ita Wegman's first use of mistletoe in the medical practice. Threefoldness is the key to understanding cancer as well as the medicine used to treat it. Threefoldness therefore not only facili - tates an understanding of the human being; it is also the source of therapeutic forces. Regaining health consists in the harmoniza - tion of our own, individual threefoldness. Rudolf Steiner's wooden sculpture depicts the Christ being, the represen - tative of humanity, between the ex - tremes of hardening ahrimanic and loos - ening luciferic forces, and is therefore the archetype of all healing measures. At present we witness that this threefold - ness is under threat, in individuals as well as in the social organism. The re-emergence of nationalist tendencies obfuscates the ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity. These ideals need healing forces for the sal - vation of humankind and for the overcom - ing of the growing coldness. Rudolf Steiner described anthroposophy as a science of the spirit that can only thrive on the soil of brotherliness. Anthroposophy contributes to the humanization of the social life so that the light and warmth of the Christ Sun can be effective, health-bringing forces. As humanity today we are responsible for the earth's warmth. Anthroposophy can inspire ways of relating responsi - bly to the earth's warming atmosphere, to the light and to the Sun. As human beings we are as responsible for the warmth of the earth (climate change) as for our relationships, for world peace. Perspectives of therapy From external applications to mistletoe therapy, Anthroposophic Medicine offers a wealth of treatments for imbalances of the warmth organism. The Medical Sec - tion's five care areas * will be at the centre of this year's Medical Section Conference, where they will be studied interprofession - ally under the heading of \u00abLiving Warmth\u00bb. We would like all therapists to join us in working on these topics and contribute their individual experiences from their countries. We will look at the effect warmth has on body, soul and mind from the point of view of the various therapeutic professions and will also focus on this theme in our Class work. For the evening before the last confer - ence day we are planning a joyful and stimulating gathering on the Goetheanum terrace. | Matthias Girke and Georg Soldner, GoetheanumMedical Section: \u00ab Living Warmth\u00bb Conference Connecting with the warmth forces The Medical Section will embark on a new series of annual conferences on the topic of \u00abwarmth\u00bb. The cosmos has evolved out of warmth and our innermost individuality lives and weaves in the warmth of our body - when we have a fever our temperature is raised while in cancer patients the thermoregulation is out of balance. feature * 1 Pregnancy, birth, childhood, living with disability 2 Fever, acute infections, avoidance of antibiotic illness 3 Anxiety, sleep disorders, depression 4 Cancer 5 Pain treatment, end of life care Annual "}
