Prerequisite(s): one course in anthropology or sociology. A ANT 382/A ARH 381 Maya Art and Archaeology (3) This course delves deeply into the cultures of indigenous Maya civilizations from 1000 B.C. into the early Colonial era. Maya peoples lived in a region defined by southern Mexico and Central America today. Maya studies embrace an interdisciplinary approach drawn from archeology, art history, hieroglyphic records, and ethnohistory. Pre-Columbian Maya social identity, modes of governance (and kingship), and political economies varied through space and time. This course follows serial achievements of Maya states, characterized by cycles of collapse and resurgence as well as long-term resilience and sustainability. The class will study kings, their retinues, and their foundations of power from ample works of art and hieroglyphic writing that have long captured public attention. It will also study the everyday life of commoners from the perspectives of household archaeology and ethnohistory. Commoners' diversified labor pursuits were the foundation of regional economies. The course emphasizes and celebrates the understanding of Maya world view and beliefs, shared across the social spectrum in the Pre-Columbian era, and important to indigenous descendant populations today. Course content includes case studies of key kingdoms as well as important topics such as landscape, religion, households, gender roles, economy, warfare, and ritual combat (the ballgame).

A ANT 447 Food, Taste, and Culture (3) This course is an in-depth anthropological examination of food and taste from a cultural politics perspective puts what we eat and why at the center of debate and analysis. The course is based in ethnographically rich case studies that explore the cultural, economic, and social processes related to food production and consumption, as well as how taste and disgust are socially constructed. Some questions that are explored in this course include: how have anthropologists studied food and taste; what theoretical perspectives have guided anthropological research on food and taste; why are some foods elevated to be markers of ethnic or national identity; why do some foods go global; what are the processes behind food gaining World Heritage status; and how is food and the cultivation of taste linked to equity, health, and social justice? Food and taste are inter-linked and part of complex cultural processes that take on different meanings, depending on their local, regional, national, and transnational contexts. These meanings and the ways they are accepted or contested can help us better understand relations of power, social class differences, and even global inequities that food consumption and production can create in local communities and everyday lives. Only one version of A ANT 447/547 may be taken for credit. Prerequisite(s): junior or senior standing.

A ANT 472 (= A LCS 472) Social Movements in Latin America (3) This class takes an anthropological perspective to discuss contemporary Latin American social movements. It considers why the intensification of social movements throughout the region may follow some traditional forms of resistance and mobilization, but also why it is a response to neoliberal globalization. These new movements seek to define a novel relation to the political realm. Unlike traditional guerrilla movements or electoral expressions of the left, they are not fundamentally organized to seize state power. Yet they have contributed to destabilizing, even, ousting governments. Social movement formation and resistance to neoliberalism are explored. Social movements, such as the indigenous mobilizations in Ecuador, mobilizations against water privatizations and gas pipeline investments in Bolivia, the Zapatista movement in Mexico, landless rural workers in Brazil, Afro-Colombians resisting investors, and the urban worker strikes in Argentina, are covered. Only one version may be taken for credit. Prerequisite(s): one course in anthropology, sociology, political science or geography. A ANT 475 The Folktale (3) This course examines the folktale in its oral and literary forms, with principal emphasis on the fairy tale or magic tale. Folktales are artistic creations that organize emotional experiences into a story form that has universal appeal, but which varies in accordance with ethnicity, gender, class, and other cultural and social factors. The course traces the folktale's history in Europe, from the earliest publications to the present, and explores different approaches to understanding this narrative form. Course material also includes contemporary oral tale-telling traditions from around the world and retellings of traditional tales in literature and film. Students gain experience in oral tale-telling and tale composition. The course is inter-disciplinary, combining anthropological, folkloristic, and literary approaches. Prerequisite(s): junior or senior standing or permission of instructor. A ANT 476 (= A DOC 476) Anthropology through Documentary Film (3) Anthropology, the comparative study of human beings, is typically associated in the public eye with the following themes: (so-called) exotic cultures, travel to remote places and cultural immersion (participant observation), a comparative, culturally-relative understanding of human differences, 4) colliding cultural worlds of today, yesterday and tomorrow (cultural contact, culture change, and their consequences), 5) critiques and improvements of ethnoscientific biases in studying the Other, and 6) directing a trained eye to the analysis of western industrialized cultures and their peers. We will explore these themes via the medium of film, under the general rubric of Visual Anthropology, focusing on such topics as historically important films, the politics of representation (in fiction or nonfiction), and the evolution of anthropology as a discipline. In tandem with these themes, we will explore regional cultures and their traditions related to warfare, gender identity, religion, family structure. Case studies featuring films about human rights, culture change, fictional anthropologists, and Native-authored films are also part of the course.
