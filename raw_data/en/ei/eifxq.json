PEP should be given as soon as possible during the appropriate time window. Definition o f hepatitis A immunity Persons are considered immune if they have: received 2 doses of HAV vaccine; or a history of IgM or total anti -HAV positivity during or up to four months after clinically compatible illness; or are IgG anti-HAV positive. Pre- or post -vaccination testing are not indicated. Most adults will be protected within 2 -4 weeks after one dose of vaccine. HAV vaccine has been routinely recommende d for California children since 1999, and , most California children and adolescents are immune to HAV. PEP recom mendations Persons >12 months of age, regardless of pre - existing medical conditions, SHOULD receive a dose of single -antigen HAV vaccine. In addition to vaccine, a dose of intramuscular (IM) immune globulin (IG) ( 0.1 mL/kg *) MAY also be administered to people >40 years of age basedon the provider's risk assessment. Persons >12 months of age who have chronic liver disease and/or are immunocompromised\u00a7 SHOULD rece ive a dose of intramuscular immune globulin ( IMIG) ( 0.1 mL/kg *) and a dose of HAV vaccine. Infants <12 months of age and/or persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated (who are allergic to a vaccine component) SHOULD receive intramuscular immune globulin (IMIG) (0.1 mL/kg *) instead of HAV vaccine.Persons receiving both vaccine and IG f or po st- ex posure prophylaxis m ay rece ive t hem simultaneous ly, or t h ey may r eceive whichever pro duct is available first a nd the s econd product when it is a vailabl e, providing it is administ ered wi thin the 1 4-day PEP w indow. V accine a nd IG should be a dministered at anatomically distant sites (such as different limbs). Please see additional guidance on administration of IG. Vacci ne should be g iven in a ddition to IG to potentially provide lo nger-term p ro tection f or immu no suppre ssed persons but vaccine response may be l i mited. Clinical guidance s hould be obt ained if pa tient's i mmune s tatus is unc lea r. T he efficacy o f combin ed HA V /HBV v accine (Twinrix\u00ae) f o r P E P ha s not been studie d and it is no t re commended for P EP. L ocal health departments and medical providers m ay w ish to e v aluate t he li kelihoo d and intensity of HAV exposure ( e.g., possible c ommercial food e xposure vs. known household or s exual c ontact) w hen making de cisions a nd recommendations about P EP reg imens. Exposed susceptible p regnant w omen Pregnant w o me n who be c ome infecte d with hepatitis A ha v e a n increased risk of g estational c omplications and preterm l abor. Pregnant women should receive P EP for the same indications as no npregnant w omen. It m ay be r e asonable to o ffer IG in a d dition to v a ccine for P E P, p a rticularly if the w o man is a househol d or sexual contact of a ca se. There ha s been no observe d increase i n maternal or i nfant adverse events after he pa titis A v accination or I G administration in pregnancy . Because H AV v a ccine is pr o duced from i nactivated HAV, the r isk to the f e tus is expected t o be low. Page 2 of 3 Incompletely immunized people Most persons have protective levels of antibody after one dose of HAV vaccine. Persons who have had one prior dose of vaccine may receive their second dose if it has been at least 6 months since their first dose. Persons exposed to HAV >2 weeks prior to consult The efficacy of PEP when given >2 weeks of exposure is unknown. IG is not recommended >2 weeks after exposure, but vaccine may be given to susceptible people at any time to protect against future exposures. Pediatr ic vs. adult formulations of HAV vaccine Single -antigen HAV vaccines are available in a pediatric formulation containing half the dose and volume of the adult formulation. When the adult formulation is unavailable, adults may be given two doses of the same pediatric HAV vaccine (2 pediatric doses = 1 adult dose). HAV vac cine contraindications and precautions HAV vaccine should not be administe red to persons with a history of a severe allergicreaction to a previous dose of HAV vaccine or vaccine component. Because HAV vaccine is inactivated, no special precautions need to be taken when vaccinating immunocompromised persons. For more in formatio n about the hepatitis A vaccine and hepatitis A post -exposure prophylaxis , please refer to the 2020 ACIP recommendations . Administration of HAV vaccine with other vaccine s HAV vaccine may be administered simultaneously with other routine and travel vaccines. For more information about HAV PEP See 2020 ACIP recommendations on the use of hepatitis A vaccine for postexposure prophylaxis and preexposure prophylaxis for international travel. For more information about IMIG GamaSTAN\u00ae is the only U.S. IMIG product. More information can be found on the GamaSTAN\u00ae product guide. Pa ge 3 of 3 _________ _________________ *In July 2017, the recommended dose for IMIG S/D) for HAV pre - and post -exposure prophylaxis was increased by the manufacturer due to declining HAV antibody levels in the U.S. blood supply. IMIG (GamaSTAN\u00ae S/D) is available in 2 mL and 10 mL single use vials. One source of IG is FFF Enterprises, which can be reached 24/7 at: 1- 800- 843- 7477. \u00a7 Although the CDC HAV guidance does not provide a definition of immunocompromised, IDSA guidance defines patients with high- level immunosuppression as those: with combined primary immunodeficiency disorder (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency); who are receiving can cer chemotherapy; on treatment for ALL within and until at least 6 months after completion of immunosuppressive chemotherapy; within 2 months after solid organ transplantation; who have received a bone marrow transplant until at least 12 months after finishing all immunosuppressivetreatment, or longer in patients who have developed graft -versus -host disease; with HIV infection with a CD4 T count <200 cells/mm3 (age >5 years) and percentage <15 (all ages) (some experts include HIV -infected persons who lack recent confirmation of immunologic status or measles immunity); receiving daily corticosteroid therapy with a dose 20 mg (or >2 mg/kg/day for patients who weigh <10 kg)of prednisone or equivalent for 14 days; or receiving certain biologic imm une modulators, such as a tumor necrosis factor "}
