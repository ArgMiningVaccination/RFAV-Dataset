Not only did we serve as a site for Pfizer's adult and pediatric vaccine studies, but we played a critical role in addressing vaccine hesitancy and administering COVID-19 vaccines to our underserved communities. During our peak immunization campaign, BMC offered vaccinations at four on-site locations and five off-site locations in collaboration with local partnerships. The Pharmacy Department was critical to this endeavor. Not only did we distribute vaccines to all of these clinics, including pre-drawn syringes at our on-site locations, but we provided staff to administer vaccines, as well. I was proud to have played a part, albeit small, in this campaign. Seeing the smiles and hint of optimism on our patients' faces as they waited in line for a vaccine brought significant meaning and fulfillment to my job this past spring. Despite the all-consuming nature of our COVID-19 response, our Pharmacy Department quietly had an exciting year. Most important, we kicked our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts into overdrive following the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020. To build on work began in 2019, we formed the BMC All-In Committee. The mission of the All-In Committee was to be explicit in connecting our department's actions with our value of \"many faces create our greatness.\" Please be sure to read the feature story about the All-In Committee in this annual report. Until you do, I won't bury the lead. We were able to create a scholarship to support two underrepresented minority students to complete 12 weeks of advanced pharmacy practice experience rotations at BMC. We had nearly 40 applicants from 15 different schools of pharmacy to select two recipients. While our work is far from over, this was an important achievement for us to celebrate. We continued to expand our residency program despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. We on- boarded our first non-traditional PGY1 residents this year. As a practice-focused residency training program, this expansion allows us to provide career opportunities for existing staff and be explicit about our belief that the modern day hospital pharmacist must be able to demonstrate mastery of all aspects of health-system pharmacy practice - operational and clinical. We also added a second PGY2 Ambulatory Care resident to the roster, bringing the total number of residents to fourteen. And we're not done yet. Our department continues to explore other growth opportunities for our residency program, which is a major driver of the care we provide our patients. Thank you for choosing Boston Medical Center as a potential home for your residency training. Enjoy the 2021 Annual Report. Sincerely, Kevin J. Horbowicz, PharmD, BCPS Associate Director - Inpatient Clinical Pharmacy Services 3Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 20214 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021Boston Medical Center (BMC) is an urban academic medical center and the largest safety net hospital in New England that serves a diverse patient population. Its surrounding community is a melting pot of people from multiple ethnic backgrounds. One of BMC's core values is \"many faces create our greatness.\" To support this value within the pharmacy department, the All-In Committee was established in a \"grass roots\" fashion. The mission of the committee is to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in the profession of pharmacy. The committee recognizes that diverse provider demographics across all healthcare disciplines is key to providing the highest quality of care. Therefore, it strives to ensure that all backgrounds are adequately represented in pharmacy practice. To work towards this goal, an All-In scholarship was created for students that self-identify as an underrepresented minority in pharmacy to complete 12-weeks of advanced pharmacy practice experiential rotations at BMC. The first-annual scholarship provides a stipend of $10,000 for cost of living expenses during the rotation. The rotation experience is uniquely designed to the student's interest and future career aspirations. It includes two 6-week or three 4-week rotations within any of the following care areas: ambulatory care (clinics including primary care or complex care management), anticoagulation, cardiology, critical care, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, infectious diseases, pediatrics and renal transplant. Outside of the rotation experience, the scholarship recipient is partnered with a longitudinal mentor from the All-In Mentorship program to coach clinical performance, facilitate professional growth and provide a support system. Upon initiation of the All-In scholarship, targeted outreach was conducted with schools of pharmacy at Historically Black Colleges and Universities to promote BMC. With virtual opportunities and social media engagement, the committee was able to participate in multiple showcases to highlight the scholarship to pharmacy students. The committee's proactiveness was an immense success. The scholarship received 39 applicants from 15 schools of pharmacy across the country. With such a strong applicant pool, each with their own story that embraced involvement in diversity and inclusion efforts, a single candidate could not be chosen. Therefore, the All- In Committee was honored and fortunate enough to award two full scholarships. In addition to the scholarships, the All-In Committee is currently organizing team- based cultural competency training for the Pharmacy Department. The departmental All-In Committee5 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021training aims to target intentional and/or unintentional behavioral indignities that communicate negative attitudes towards stigmatized or culturally marginalized ethnic groups. With the integral push for more minority representation, the committee wants to ensure that the department is culturally competent to support this effort. Additionally, the committee looks forward to sharing the \"All-In Approach\" with the pharmacy community during a platform presentation at ASHP Midyear 2021.Overall, BMC is very proud to have initiated the All-In campaign that seeks to develop, mentor and educate the next generation of culturally competent pharmacists. The committee is looking forward to the start of the two All-In scholarship awardees' rotational experiences in September 2021 as well as creating a network to support their future endeavors.All-In Committee 6 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021Kate P .

Currently , she serves as Director of the PGY2 Cardiology Residency at ACPHS/Capital Cardiology Associates. WHAT WAS YOUR MOST MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE AT BMC? I have so many memorable experiences from my time at BMC! The ones that stand out most, all relate back to the friendships and relationships I formed while there. The philosophy at BMC has always been \"work hard, play hard.\" (I think introduced by John Marshall?!) My best memories correspond to both sides of that statement... working hard to learn as much as I could for each rotation, figuring out an effective time management plan, late night data collection in our resident office space, and middle of the night aminoglycoside pharmacokinetic pages which were dreaded but really taught me so much! And some of my favorite memories were having fun with my co-residents and staff... resident picnics, conference trips, and happy hours! . I'll never forget cleaning out my office space at the end of my PGY2, realizing just how much I'd learned and gained in that short 2 years.WHAT HAS MOTIVATED YOU TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE YOUR CAREER? The desire to help people was one of the reasons I applied to pharmacy school. I continue to be motivated by my patients and providing them the best care possible. I am motivated to think of new ideas, create new clinical services, advocate for and advance our profession. I think it was instilled in my training at BMC to constantly think outside the box, think about what else a pharmacist can do, and push our role forward. It motivates me to instill this desire into my trainees. I also am motivated by the incredible team of healthcare providers I work with, accepting challenges and continuing to show them what a pharmacist can do. Lastly, I am motivated to show my daughters that a woman can have a successful, rewarding career while also maintaining 'mothering' as top priority.QUESTION & ANSWER ALUMNI SPOTLIGHT DR. KATE CABRAL7 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021WHAT ADVICE DO YOU GIVE STUDENTS WHEN THEY ARE PURSUING A RESIDENCY? 1. Have an open mind. 2. Try to relax... what's meant to be will be. 3. Network!4. Apply to a range of programs, in terms of their competitiveness. 5. Spend time on your letter of intent! 6. Remember that you are interviewing them just as much as they are interviewing you. 7. Smile and be yourself!8. Remember pharmacy is a small world (be mindful of professional interactions along the entire way!) 9. Tell your story- everyone has a unique path. 10. Follow your gut instincts. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE A RECENT RESIDENCY GRADUATE LOOKING TO START THEIR CAREER? Don't be afraid to take on an opportunity that scares you. Be confident in your training. Say yes to opportunities, the more you say yes to, the more that will come your way. Create a niche for yourself- do a project on a topic, present on that topic, publish a review article on that topic and before you know it....you are an expert on that topic! Don't be afraid to get out of your comfort zone a bit, take a job in another state- check out how pharmacy is practiced somewhere else! HAVE YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A FACULTY MEMBER AT A PHARMACY SCHOOL? No! I thought that at some point I might be interested in academia but I wanted to gain practical, clinical experience first. Nevertheless, Ialways kept my hands in teaching and precepting in all of my post-graduate positions. The transition from working in a hospital to academia was strange at first... I kept asking my Department Chair where I should punch in? Or what projects I should focus on first. I discovered that the increased autonomy and flexibility took some getting used to, however, now is one of the aspects I value most in my current position. WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT IN PHARMACY? OUTSIDE OF PHARMACY? I would say in pharmacy, receiving a number of teaching awards during my time here at NU, and developing a new residency program were definitely in the top of my list. Outside of pharmacy, I would say winning an international volleyball championship is one moment I will always cherish (I mean, I am 6'5\" after all so I guess it was somewhat expected)? WHERE DO YOU SEE PHARMACY HEADING IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS? I really hope that within the next few years, the work of pharmacists will be recognized with provider status. Pharmacists have truly stepped up during this pandemic and need to be recognized for it, as well as the critical role we play on the healthcare team. I think that receiving provider status, and being able to be compensated appropriately, will be a game changer for our profession. It will allow us to build further collaborative, clinical roles and duties to improve access and provide optimal care to our patients and communities. The pandemic has also highlighted pharmacists fulfilling roles through telehealth, which has been effective in many ways, so perhaps we will continue to build upon this and other creative, new ways to offer direct patient care. I think that ambulatory care pharmacy will grow and community pharmacy practices will morph into providing more direct patient care services. WHEN YOU AREN'T WORKING, WHAT DO YOU DO TO RELAX? Most of my non-working time is hanging with my girl squad (my 3 daughters who spice up any task or activity), my husband and our insane quarantine black lab puppy. I love to garden, cook, listen to music, spend time with friends and find art projects very therapeutic! I've become borderline obsessed with making my kids' Halloween costumes....maybe I'll be a costume designer someday. 8 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021Three grants for a total of $350K were awarded to our Hematology/Oncology Pharmacy team over this past year, with more initiatives currently under review. \"Improving Biomarker Driven Precision Therapy Access For Disproportionate Minority And Low-Income Patient Population In The Era Of Covid-19\" Pfizer Grant David Hughes, PharmD, BCOP Umit Tapan, MD were awarded a $250,000 grant from Pfizer to carry out their project. Biomarker based testing has become a standard to guide treatment decisions for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is crucial for both early stage/resected and late-stage patients. Over the past several years, numerous new markers have been identified and subsequently, targeted therapies have been developed to focus on these biomarkers. It is imperative for all members of the lung cancer treatment team (oncologists, pathologists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, nurses, and physicians' assistants) to understand new data and recognize the complexity of managing these patients. In community practice, there are several knowledge gaps that may exist and education on treatment considerations and supportive/toxicity management is imperative in this growing field. Within our patient population at BMC, approximately 70% of patients are underserved minorities and over 50% are below the federal poverty line. This compounds operational barriers that may prohibit optimal care for patients. The overall goal of this project is to help identify critical gaps in standard biomarker testing and help improve understanding of targeted based therapies for patients with NSCLC. Integration of the BMC specialty pharmacy can bring unique perspective on how to prevent financial delay to patients. This educational series will focus on the biomarker-based approach and discuss ways to overcome identified barriers that may interfere with testing. It will also address primary literature and clinical pearls needed to attain the best outcomes for all patients with NSCLC, regardless of social determinants.HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY GRANTS 9 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY GRANTS \"Creating A Hematologic Malignancy And Supportive Care Biosimilar Educational Toolbox For Healthcare Providers In The Covid-19 (Sars-Cov-2) Era.\" Pfizer Grant Alison Stebbings, PharmD, PharmD, BCOP were awarded a $48,500 grant from Pfizer to carry out their project. This project aims to increase provider awareness and competence with the uptake of biosimilars, specifically within the hematology and supportive care space. This educational initiative will address potential barriers to implementing biosimilars and provide insight on how to overcome these barriers with institutional-specific data. To carry out this project, they are currently conducting a medication use evaluation on biosimilar use in supportive care at BMC. They are examining both clinical and financial outcomes related to the conversion from a reference long acting granulocyte colony-stimulating factor product (Neulasta) to a biosimilar product (Udenyca), and then from one biosimilar product (Udenyca) to a new biosimilar product (Fulphila). They are also examining prescribing trends and clinical outcomes related to biosimilar use in supportive care during the COVID-19 pandemic at BMC. This information will be presented at the institutional, local and regional level through platform presentations and with the additional goal of publishing their findings. \"Building And Implementing An Oncology Biosimilar Educational Curriculum For A Strategically Targeted Audience To Help Bridge Current And Future Gaps Of Biosimilar Adoption Within Oncology\" Radhika Jhaveri, Rph, Bcop Were Awarded $50,000 For This Educational Grant. This project aims to develop educational activities with an overarching goal that will complement and/or enhance the understanding of biosimilars and their use in patients with cancer for trainees and seasoned health care professionals. To accomplish the goal, we plan to create educational activities/curriculum for a targeted audience such as physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, pharmacists and health care providers i n training and already practicing. The educational activities will be delivered as a part of ongoing routine continuing educational activities (ex: nursing competency, grand rounds, cross functional residency/fellowship educational events etc.) across multiple disciplines involved in managing patients with cancer. We will also examine and share our institution's biosimilar adoption process as well as clinical outcomes related to adoption of biosimilars across multiple cancers through presentations at healthcare meetings or via publication. 10 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021 At long last, it was time for a resident-driven activity. The esteemed delegates, Lynnette and Spencer set up this month's event \"So you think you know your coworker\". Participants paired up with their work-spouses for a series of trivia games. Turns out, we might not know each other as well as we thought. October also means Pharmacy Week at Boston Medical Center. The department celebrated with snacks, trivia, and a twin day that truly showed the department's devotion to the craft. Once again, we have to applaud Megan and Kim for going where only one man has gone before. BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER RESIDENT EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TEAM (REST) ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021 AUGUST 2020: Virtual Happy hour SEPTEMBER 2020: TriviaOCTOBER 2020: So You Think You Know Your Coworker - Pharmacy Week The 2020-2021 year kicked off with a Zoom happy hour. We got to know our new residents a little better with a game of \"Guess Who: Resident Edition,\" and showed off our artistic talents with a game of \"Drawful.\" The Chill Pills (aka BMC Pharmacy Residency team) attempted their first virtual Stump! Trivia. Although we may not have placed first (or second or third), we were proud of our efforts and learned some fun facts. 11 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021 BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER RESIDENT EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TEAM (REST) ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021 MARCH 2021: March Madness APRIL 2021 Yoga If there's one thing all pharmacists love, it is Sports. Sarah organized this classic yearly tradition for the inhabitants of BN-05a. For some *cough* Jess *cough* their bark was bigger than their bite. Ultimately, it was Cardiology guru Dong who had his heart in the game. The REST committee sponsored a Zoom yoga event instructed by Allysa Donnally, a hatha yoga instructor with over a decade of experience. The hour session was a \"moving meditation\" that involved whole body stretching and connecting breathing to physical movement. It was a relaxing and recharging event for all who attended!In December, the REST committee led by Shyam, hosted a virtual Among Us night. Among Us is a \"mafia-esque\" game in which up to 10 players are stranded on a crashed space ship. The ship must be fixed for the crew to survive. The twist? 2 players are imposter aliens whose sole purpose is to sabotage the repair and kill off the crewmates. It's a race against time as the imposters and crewmates battle for survival. Over the course of 3 hours, countless games would be played, with the Imposters usually outsmarting Crewmates. By the end of the evening, participants were proficient enough to spot lies and those faking their tasks. Ultimately, the true fun surrounded Lynette having the odd luck of never being assigned an Imposter role for over 3 hours! FEBRUARY 2021 Game Night In February, Jasmine and Eleanor led a virtual game night and happy hour(s) for the monthly REST committee event. Participants were split into three game groups: Code Names, Jackbox TV, and Joking Hazard. There was great representation from both the inpatient and ambulatory care preceptor groups, and most of the residents also joined in to unwind after a stressful afternoon of last-minute MSHP abstract revisions and submissions! As attendees started to sign off for the evening, the remaining participants congregated in the Joking Hazard breakout room. There were a lot of laughs as participants competed to complete the funniest three-panel comic strip! Thank you to everyone who attended! DECEMBER 2020: Among Us:12 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021 STRONG WORK AWARD PRECEPTOR OF THE YEARHESHAM RAGHIB, Hesham Raghib was selected for the \"Strong Work\" award by the residency class of 2020-2021. All the PGY1s and most of the PGY2s have worked with Hesham during their central staffing shifts or when calling down to the central pharmacy for help when on decentralized shifts. Hesham played a significant role in the residents' training and adjustment to the central pharmacy workflow at the start of the year. Furthermore, he has continued to remain an excellent resource for the residents. Every time a resident calls down to the central pharmacy and speaks to him, he has gone above and beyond to help the residents with what they need. He always keeps the patients in mind in all that he does and truly embodies the skills and dedication of a strong and caring pharmacist. MEGAN FEENEY, PHARMD, BCCCP The Dana Whitney Preceptor of Award was awarded to Dr. Megan Feeney. BMC's 2020-2021 residency class nominated her based on her dedication to the program. Dr. Feeney precepted five residents and multiple students in the CCU and MICU over the year. Residents appreciated the time she devoted to her learners, her patient demeanor, and her commitment to BMC's patients. Dr. Feeney served as the chair of the professional development committee this year in which she organized and moderated numerous helpful career planning sessions. Dr. Feeney also served as the project advisor for a longitudinal resident quality improvement project. The residents acknowledged that Dr. Feeney consistently showed her support by attending every pharmacy grand rounds presentation and case conference. The 2020-2021 BMC Pharmacy Residency Class would like to congratulate Dr. Feeney on her new position as the BMC Critical Care Pharmacy Residency Program Director. Thank you for being an exemplary pharmacist and preceptor!RESIDENCY EXCELLENCE AWARDS13 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021The resident of year award is presented to the BMC resident who demonstrates a positive attitude, provides excellent patient care, strives for continues growth and supports the education of the next generation of pharmacy learners. This year, in contrast to other years, the resident of the year award was given to two very deserving pharmacy residents. Please find excerpts from each of these excellent residents' nomination forms. MONIQUE PAYNE-CARDONA, PHARMD, BCPS - PGY2 EMERGENCY MEDICINE Monique Payne-Cardona is strong clinically and has performed exceptionally on rotations. Emergency Department (ED) nursing and physician staff regularly provide unsolicited feedback on how helpful she is, how she went the extra mile to improve patient care, and how we should create a position to hire her. Her strong performance extends beyond patient care. She has turned in high quality work early for all assignments, which has enabled her to be involved in additional research projects (i.e. ED Suboxone Take Home Kits vs Discharge Rx, Women in Pharmacy Leadership). Monique routinely seeks out additional activities to improve patient safety, staff education, and pharmacy department engagement. In addition to her Recruitment Committee work, Monique has been an active member of our All-In Committee. She helped at our virtual showcases at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, screened and interviewed applicants for the All-In Scholarship, and will be presenting a platform presentation called \"The All-In Approach to Improving Diversity and Inclusion within Pharmacy Practice\" with Chris Fagbote and Jessica Fortune-Cherry at ASHP Midyear 2021. Additionally, Monique brings an upbeat, pleasant, positive outlook and energy to every interaction with nurses, physicians, students, co-residents, and pharmacists. She has served as an excellent role model for APPE students and residents and embodies our BMC values. MEISSANE LEE, PHARMD - PGY-2 AMBULATORY CARE, CHIEF RESIDENT I cannot speak highly enough of the work Meissane has done this year. Through her leadership as Chief Resident, professional involvement on the steering committee for New England Institute of Ambulatory Care Pharmacists (NEIAP), mentoring co-residents/students, and her scholarship activities all while prioritizing patient care exemplifies her maturity and dedication. She has been recognized countless times by her peers for her work as Chief by helping with our resident's transition through extra support and attention. She has been described by her peers as always being patient, having a very positive attitude, and serving as a great role model. She keeps candy at her desk for her co-residents and will come down to the resident office during her lunch break to fill it up if its running low. She has demonstrated strong communication skills as Chief and is always smiling. The feedback from preceptors has highlighted her strengths as a clinician and dedication to her patients. Preceptors have described Meissane as an exceptional clinician and communicator. Her work ethic and commitment to patient care exhibits a professionalism and poise that is well beyond her years. Meissane's care is exemplified in patients telling family members about her, to building the trust of a patient who did not trust the health care system, or when patients continue to ask to still see Meissane after she has finished a rotation. Other patient examples are when a patient told her this was the first visit he felt listened to after seeing multiple specialists for his DM, or another patient of hers who was admitted and called Meissane specifically to ask her to visit during their admission. I could continue to list the stories and feedback that has been shared with me. It is truly inspiring to see the amount of people she has impacted through her work. She has been dedicated to see the success and continued growth of our residency programs. Her work throughout this year has demonstrated an ability to collaborate with multiple disciplines, actively engage in high quality patient care, and mentor young professionals. People tend to gravitate towards Meissane, whether it's her peers, patients or preceptors. She is an authentic individual that gains your trust quickly. RESIDENT OF THE YEARRESIDENCY EXCELLENCE AWARDSRESIDENCY EXCELLENCE AWARDS14 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021RESIDENCY EXCELLENCE AWARDS IMPACT OF IMPROVING THE MEDICATION PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROCESS IN AN AMBULATORY ONCOLOGY INFUSION CLINIC - LED BY LYNETTE HENSHAW, PHARMD SCHOLARSHIP PROJECT OF THE YEAR The Scholarship-Project-of-the-Year award is bestowed upon a residentproject that exemplifies excellence in advancing patient care and/or improving the medication use system at Boston Medical Center. This year's award was received by Lynette Henshaw PGY2 in oncology for her work on the project titled \"Impact of improving the medication prior authorization process in an ambulatory oncology infusion clinic\". This was a yearlong effort to improve the medication prior authorization process in the BMC infusion clinic. After many \"deep dives\" into the reimbursement data it was identified that BMC was losing approx. $100,000 a month (> $1M/year) in drug reimbursement due to either medication PA's not being done, or not being done in a timely fashion. Lynnette worked with providers, pharmacy liaisons, and the oncology pharmacy team to educate them on the new PA process. Since the launch of the new PA process in October of 2020, the average loss is down to $10,000 a month in revenue (compared to $100,000/month previously]. If insurance does not pay, technically the patient is responsible for payment, which can create a HUGE stress for patients. At BMC, if patients cannot afford the cost of their treatment, BMC covers the cost entirely. This improvement has created a smooth workflow for providers, nurses, and pharmacy. Not only is this QI project a huge achievement for institutional initiatives (preventing large revenue losses) but also impacts our mission to take care of cancer patients by eliminating unnecessary stress.15 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021NON-TRADITIONAL PGY1 (CONTINUATION)CAREER Meissane Lee, PharmD Clinical Specialist - Ambulatory Gastroenterology at Boston Medical Center, Boston, MAPawlose Ketema, PharmDClinical Specialist - Infectious Diseases at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Baltimore, MDLynnette Henshaw, PharmDClinical Specialist - Hematology/Oncology at Boston Medical Center, Boston, MARyan Zabrosky, PharmDClinical Specialist - Internal Medicine at University of Pittsburg Medical Center, Harrisburg, PA Ava Cascone, PharmDClinical Specialist - Neurocritical Care at Boston Medical Center, Boston, MAMonique Payne-Cardona, PharmD, BCPS Clinical Specialist - Emergency Medicine at Resurrection Medical Center, Chicago, ILJoshua Hayden, PharmDClinical Pharmacist at Koloski, Boston Medical Center Jessica Sullivan, PharmD PGY-2 Cardiology at University of Michigan Health SystemSpencer Sutton, PharmDPGY-2 Infectious Diseases at Boston Medical Center Sopheaktra Kong, PharmD Non-Traditional PGY-1 at Boston Medical CenterPGY2 Boston Medical CenterJessica Freydman, PharmD GY-2 Oncology at Boston Medical Center 16 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2021 16 15Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2020Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 20202021-2022 BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER PGY-1 PHARMACY RESIDENTS Emily Plasencia: PGY1 Dr. Plasencia is from Sacramento, California.
