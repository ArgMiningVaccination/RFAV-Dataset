Friendly staff, great location, outstanding resort facilities, amazing view from my room - what else could I ask for?! Due to weather conditions we arrived one day later, the whole programme was rescheduled for us so we didn't miss anything. Very professional. I especially enjoyed the outdoor activities (mountain biking and kayaking) and I wish I have booked to stay longer. Health and Fitness Travel was a great company to book with, they have a good selection of options, detailed description of the programmes, professional and friendly staff prepared to adjust the programme to fit client's personal needs and wishes. - SandraVisited April 2017 I had an amazing time at Galo Resort. I return home 100% rejuvenated. Everything about the stay was wonderful. I will recommend this package to all of my friends, and I have already one dear friend signing up for some time during the spring! - PhilippaVisited April 2017 Absolutely brilliant break, loved it! The hotel was very spacious, clean and airy, the gym was truly fantastic. The staff were so friendly, and the equipment they had available was first rate. Group classes were fun and friendly. If you are looking for a holiday somewhere sunny, with a lovely pool area, to really work up your fitness then I can't recommend Galo Resort enough. I'll definitely be back next year. PS: The best massage at the spa is the Deep Tissue (I ended up booking 3 of them over the week). Worth every second of it! [Read more Read less](#read-more-review-83) - IreneVisited November 2016 Galo's fitness gym is brilliant! Just what I wanted: very well-equipped gym and very knowledgeable Personal Trainers ! It's indeed the perfect place for a fitness break. Very clean and comfortable hotel, good food, (with the options to eat very healthily) and a brilliant gym and indoor pool. The personal sessions were fantastic and the gym equipment was extremely good. - SeverineVisited September 2016 I had a fantastic week! The hotel was very good, and the staff very friendly. All activities were very well organised and so much fun!! Especially sea kayak and snorkelling... wonderful! I added a few activities with the company \"Loko-Loko\" that is part of the hotel, and it was brilliant!!!! (such as Canyoning). Again, amazing staff - so professional and serious; but also incredibly friendly and fun - They were brilliant! I'm now back at work feeling great! Thank you for organising it all! - KayeVisited September 2016 I would 100% percent recommend the 6 day Ayurvedic package. I feel so much better than I did 8 days ago! The place is really well organised, the food is outstanding, the Ayurveda centre is amazing (not posh and full of frills but professional and I felt really well looked after). Just 1 down side: trying to find follow up Ayurvedic products in the UK is proving hard. I want to carry on using the Ayurveda principles! I must go back next year! - JamesVisited August 2016 I have returned from my holiday revitalised, motivated and relaxed. I had an amazing time and would love to go back again. I felt a week was maybe not long enough! The hotel was in a beautiful location and all the staff were amazing. They were extremely friendly, kind and helpful......like a little family!! Food and treatments were amazing too. We didn't have much time to explore but managed 2 short walks which were very pleasant. I have recommended this holiday to many envious people on my return! Highs - Galo offers a plethora of activities and facilities, perfect for those wanting an active holiday. - The azure blue waters surrounding the hotel attract scuba divers from all over the world. - The staff are very friendly and speak an array of languages. - The gym is big and well equipped, so no excuses! - The ambiance and cuisine served at the 'Pizzeria Galosol' and 'Atlantis Fish Restaurant' are excellent.
