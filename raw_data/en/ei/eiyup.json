It is important to realize that some of the toxins we believe impact our body, actually come from the mind. Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj explains that these toxins of the mind arise from various spheres of life, such as our work, relationships, and the world at large. Happenings worldwide can cause fear, stress, and anxiety within us that can affect our well-being on many levels. They also can keep us from our primary goal of finding our way back to God. To resolve this problem, we need to get to the origin of the toxins. Meditation helps us defocus from these toxic stresses and focus our attention on the treasures of tranquility, joy, and bliss within ourselves. Meditation helps us home into God's love. As we experience this divine love, we are strengthened and can better handle the turmoil of the outer world. Sunday, February 19 2 - 3PM Science of Spirituality Meditation Center 15 Market Street Perth Amboy, NJ 08861 All are Welcome!
