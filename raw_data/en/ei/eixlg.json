If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission [Here's our process](/product-selection-process). Greatist only shows you brands and products that we stand behind.Our team thoroughly researches and evaluates the recommendations we make on our site. To establish that the product manufacturers addressed safety and efficacy standards, we: - Evaluate ingredients and composition: Do they have the potential to cause harm? - Fact-check all health claims: Do they align with the current body of scientific evidence? - Assess the brand: Does it operate with integrity and adhere to industry best practices? Are you getting enough D? (Ummm, we mean [vitamin D](/health/vitamin-d).) Well you better check because you need it for [calcium](/health/surprising-dairy-free-sources-of-calcium) and phosphorus absorption, bone health, and [muscle growth](/fitness/how-much-muscle-can-you-gain-in-a-month) and development. Your bod makes vitamin D when exposed to [sunlight](/discover/sun-lamp) (and you can get it from [some foods](/health/foods-with-minerals)), but sometimes you still might not get enough. In fact, [about 1 billion people worldwide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532266/) have a vitamin D deficiency. And about 50 percent of the population has an insufficiency (meaning they don't have a full deficiency, but they're definitely not getting enough vitamin D). If you need more vitamin D in your life, you can take an over-the-counter supplement. Not sure which one to choose? We got you \u2014 here's a list of the best vitamin D supplements to take when the sun just ain't cutting it. 8 best vitamin D supplements of 2022 - Best vitamin D and multivitamin combo: Chewable](#garden) Knowing that this is something you're going to be putting in your bod, we held our picks to high standards. Here are the criteria we used: Quality We put all the products through a rigorous medical and business vetting process. This process checks whether companies are doing anything shady (like saying its products cure certain diseases), whether their products use evidence-based ingredients, and whether they've received any FDA/FTC warning letters. We included products only from companies that passed this process and have strict standards for quality and purity. Nutrient bioavailability There are actually two forms of vitamin D \u2014 D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol). The only difference is in the chemical side chains, but both are well absorbed [in your gut](/live/good-gut-health). Supplements can be made with either D2 or D3, but [most research shows](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/longterm-vitamin-d3-supplementation-is-more-effective-than-vitamin-d2-in-maintaining-serum-25hydroxyvitamin-d-status-over-the-winter-months/A6CD4FE5C649E0FAC9BCBAFB23538707) that vitamin D3 increases the level of vitamin D in your blood to a greater extent and for longer than D2 does. For that reason, we only included vitamin D3 supplements. Reviews [Supplements](/eat/what-you-should-know-about-supplements) are a dime a dozen \u2014 one Google search will show you thousands to choose from. We chose products that had great reviews from A LOT of people. Pricing guide - $ = under $15 - $$ = $15-$20 - $$$ = over $20 Best vitamin D and multivitamin combo [Ritual Essential Multivitamin Capsule \u2014 60 count](https://activation.healthline.com/api/member-offers/4333/redirect?lp=328&tc=120226&subid2=%2Fgr8%2Fhealth%2Fbest-vitamin-d-supplement&subid=ritual_multivitamingrid_hl_vms_4551&correlationId=null) - Price: $$$ - Supplement type: capsule Instead of being jam-packed with every [vitamin and mineral](/eat/one-day-menu-for-nutrients) under the sun, this multivitamin was developed to fill nutrient gaps according to your sex and age. The company's motto is \"less is more\" \u2014 so you aren't getting unnecessary nutrients that you're likely getting plenty of from the [food you eat](/eat/vegan-vitamin-d). Considerations: Before taking any supplement, it's important to check with a healthcare professional. If they've given you a thumbs-up on a vitamin D supplement, but you want to go with a multivitamin combo, get another thumbs-up for the rest of the vitamins included in this all-in-one option. How to take it: Take 2 capsules per day to get 2,000 IU (50 micrograms [mcg]) of vitamin D. Best subscription service vitamin D [Care/Of Vitamin D Capsule \u2014 30-day supply](https://activation.healthline.com/api/member-offers/5369/redirect?lp=328&tc=120226&subid2=%2Fgr8%2Fhealth%2Fbest-vitamin-d-supplement&subid=careof_vitamind_universal_vms_tl_6788&correlationId=null) - Price: $-$$$ (varies) - Supplement type: capsule Take a quick quiz and you have all your nutrient needs personalized based on your answers. Care/Of offers two vitamin D options: vegan D3 \u2014 which is sourced from [algae](/eat/seamoss) \u2014 and a regular D3 (1,000 IU, or 25 mcg). Considerations: As fun as it is to rip open a personalized vitamin pouch with your name on it, this kind of service might end up [costing you more money](/happiness/ways-save-money) than taking a vitamin D supp on its own. How to take it: Take 1 capsule per day with a meal to get 1,000 IU (25 mcg) of vitamin D. [Persona Vitamin D Capsule \u2014 28-day supply](https://activation.healthline.com/api/member-offers/6595/redirect?lp=328&tc=120226&subid2=%2Fgr8%2Fhealth%2Fbest-vitamin-d-supplement&subid=persona_universal_homepage_textlink_35115&correlationId=null) - Price: $-$$$ (varies) - Supplement type: capsule This is another subscription-based company that asks you to complete a quick questionnaire to determine your personalized vitamin and mineral needs. Persona offers three vitamin D options: - Vitamin D: contains 1,000 IU (25 mcg) in a [gelatin](/health/gelatin)capsule form - Vegan Vitamin D: contains 1,000 IU (25 mcg) in a [vegan-friendly](/eat/vegan-grocery-list)softgel - DHA with Vitamin D: combines heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids (225 mg of DHA and 42 mg of EPA) and vitamin D (1,000 IU, or 25 mcg) Considerations: Again, going the ultra-personalized route can wind up being costly since you get what's tailored to you sent right to your door. So while it's convenient (and cool AF), it's prob cheaper to just order a vitamin D supplement. How to take it: Take 1 capsule per day to get 1,000 IU (25 mcg) of vitamin D. Best vitamin D liquid softgel [Sports Research Vitamin D3 Softgels \u2014 360 count](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JGCBGZQ?tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $ - Supplement type: softgel This one will last you an entire year \u2014 at a reasonable price. Plus, it's made without [gluten](/eat/gluten-free-diet-what-is-it-really), [soy](/health/foods-that-kill-testosterone), or GMOs. Since vitamin D is fat-soluble, consuming it with a fatty meal can help your body absorb the vitamin. A [2015 study](https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01468-3/fulltext) found that plasma vitamin D3 levels were 32 percent greater in people who took the supplement with a [fat-containing meal](/health/superfood-avocado) compared to a fat-free meal. This specific supplement is infused with [coconut oil](/health/refined-vs-unrefined-coconut-oil), so the fat comes along with it! Considerations: Although the addition of [coconut oil](/health/coconut-oil-detox) can help with absorption, it also means that folks with an allergy to tree nuts may need to choose a different D3 supplement. If you're allergic to nuts, steer clear unless your doctor gives the OK. How to take it: Take 1 softgel per day, which provides 5,000 IU (125 mcg) of vitamin D. [NatureWise Vitamin D3 Softgels 360 - Price: This D3 supplement uses cold-pressed [organic olive oil](/health/olive-oil-vs-vegetable-oil) to help with absorption, so this softgel is a better option for people with tree nut allergies. It's also free of the [top eight major food allergens](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/food-allergies): [wheat](/health/whole-grain-vs-whole-wheat), soy, [dairy](/eat/is-dairy-bad-for-you-benefits-of-milk), corn, eggs, [peanuts](/health/craving-peanut-butter), [fish](/eat/tuna-vs-salmon), and shellfish. Considerations: One downside is that this product isn't [vegan](/eat/what-is-a-vegan-diet) \u2014 the capsules are made with gelatin. How to take it: Take 1 softgel per day for 5,000 IU (125 mcg) of vitamin D3. Best vitamin D chewable tablets [Carlyle Chewable D3 Tablets (Natural Berry Flavor) \u2014 180 count](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LB9ZD1F/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07LB9ZD1F&linkCode=as2&tag=grt-best-vitamin-d-supplement-20&linkId=08ce84a95e353076dc870641ad161e9a&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $ - Supplement type: chewable tablet These chewables are packaged in the USA and made in an FDA-regulated facility. With each chewable tablet, you'll get 2,000 IU of vitamin D without any gluten, [lactose](/health/lactose-free-diet), [wheat](/eat/barley-vs-wheat), soy, or artificial flavors or colors. A lot of reviewers say these vitamins are super easy to chew, since they're small and have a tolerable flavor. Considerations: These vitamins contain artificial sugar to keep them from tasting like bitter chalk. Artificial sugars are regulated by the FDA but can cause [digestive issues](/discover/facts-gut-health) for some people who are more sensitive to them. How to take it: Take 1 tablet per day with a meal \u2014 this will provide 2,000 IU (50 mcg) of vitamin D. Best vitamin D gummies [Mama Bear Organic Kids Vitamin D3 Gummies \u2014 80 count](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NW4X9PV/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07NW4X9PV&linkCode=as2&tag=grt-best-vitamin-d-supplement-20&linkId=2baca55ea0e9b0422cf69e518d20596a&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $ - Supplement type: gummy Want a gummy supplement that tastes like [candy](/eat/keto-candy) but is actually good for you and any kiddos? These organic fruity gummies include strawberry, lemon, and orange flavors and support strong bones and immune health. Even though they're advertised as kids' vitamins, we promise they'll benefit you too (and we won't tell ). Considerations: These gummies have a bit of added sugar (1 gram, to be exact) to make them tolerable for the little ones. They also use organic natural flavors and colors. How to take it: Adults and kids ages 2 and older can take 1 gummy daily for 1,000 IU of D3. [Nature's Way Alive! Calcium + D3 60 count](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZC9H25T?tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $ - Supplement type: gummy The addition of calcium and fruit/veggie powder sets this supplement apart to give your bones some extra love. Like vitamin D, calcium is important for strong bones \u2014 and your body needs vitamin D [to help it absorb calcium](https://www.bones.nih.gov/health-info/bone/bone-health/nutrition/calcium-and-vitamin-d-important-every-age). These gummies are also gelatin-free and gluten-free. Considerations: Because of the ingredients, a 2-gummy dose contains 25 calories and 7 grams of carbohydrates. And you'll need to stock up on these \u2014 with 60 gummies per container and a dosage of 2 gummies twice a day, you'll go through them quickly. How to take it: Take 2 gummies (2,000 IU of D3 and 520 mg of calcium total) twice daily, with or without food. Best vitamin D capsule [NOW High Potency Vitamin D3 Softgels \u2014 120 count](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002EA99HE?tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $ - Supplement type: softgel If you're forgetful, you'll like that you only have to take this supplement once every 2 days. It also comes from a brand that's known for high quality supplements, and it's free of the top eight allergens. Considerations: If you're [vegetarian](/eat/types-of-vegetarians) or vegan, this one is a no-go since it's made with bovine gelatin. How to take it: Take 1 capsule every 2 days with a fat-containing meal to get 5,000 IU (125 mcg) of vitamin D. Best vitamin D drops [Thorne Vitamin D/K2 Liquid \u2014 1 fluid ounce](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0038NF8MG?tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $$$ - Supplement type: liquid You get two fat-soluble vitamins in one with [vitamin K](/health/vitamin-k) and D in this liquid. A [2017 review](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ije/2017/7454376/) found that having optimal intake of both K and D was important for bone and [cardiovascular health](/eat/heart-healthy-snacks). This product is also free of the major allergens and has simple dosing that can make it easy to use for both kids and adults. Considerations: Because this supplement contains vitamin K, this may not be a good option for you if you take blood-thinning medication. Vitamin K can counteract the effects of those medications. How to take it: Take 2 drops one to three times daily (2 drops contain 1,000 IU, or 25 mcg, of vitamin D3). Best vegan vitamin D supplement [Naturelo Vitamin D3 Capsules \u2014 180 count](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P1J4RN9?tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $$ - Supplement type: capsule A lot of vitamin D3 supplements are made from lanolin (sheep's wool), but that just doesn't work in the vegan lifestyle. This supplement is made from wild-harvested lichen, which is a fungus. Since fungi grow outdoors, they're exposed to UVB rays. This product also doesn't contain GMOs, soy, gluten, dairy, corn, nuts, additives, preservatives, or coloring. Considerations: It comes only in capsule form, which some people may not prefer, and it's one of the pricier options on our list. How to take it: Take 1 capsule daily with food to get 5,000 IU (125 mcg) of vitamin D. [Garden of Life mykind Vegan Chewable Tablets (Raspberry-Lemon - Price: $ - Supplement type: chewable tablet If capsules aren't your thing, these chewables are certified organic, non-GMO, vegan, and gluten-free. They contain a mixture of lichen and organic mushroom for D3. Mushrooms could contain [more than 10 micrograms](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/10/1498/htm) of vitamin D, depending on their UV exposure. This product also contains an organic food blend (a mixture of [flaxseed](/eat/seeds-for-health), [carrot](/health/carrot-juice-benefits), [broccoli](/health/broccoli-vs-cauliflower), [cauliflower](/eat/recipe/egyptian-fried-cauliflower-recipe), and [spinach](https://greatist.com/health/superfood-spinach)) for added nutrients. Even the raspberry-lemon flavor is created with organic flavoring and without added sugar or artificial sweetener. Considerations: The quantity is on the small side. With only a 30-day supply, you'll need to reorder more often. How to take it: Chew 1 tablet daily, which will give you 5,000 IU (50 mcg) of vitamin D. [The sun](/health/how-to-tan-safely) doesn't shine all the time, and it's possible you don't always get enough vitamin D from food. If you live in a place where it rains, sleets, and snows, it's not always possible to get enough vitamin D from the sun. Certain individuals and populations are also at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency, including: - older adults - people with higher body weight - people in nursing homes or hospitals - people with dark skin tones Another challenge: Your body needs UVB radiation in order to absorb sunlight and convert it to usable vitamin D3. UV radiation is considered a carcinogen and is one of the biggest reasons for [skin cancer](/health/melanoma). [Sunscreen](/health/best-sunscreen/) reduces your UV exposure, which reduces your risk of cancer but also blocks some vitamin D-producing UV rays. Signs of deficiency If you have a vitamin D deficiency, your body will give you a heads-up. Some common symptoms you may notice if your levels are too low are: - frequent illness [tiredness](/health/all-i-want-to-do-is-sleep) - bone and muscle pain [depression](/health/stages-of-depression) - bone loss [hair loss](/health/thinning-hair) But many of these symptoms could have other causes, so getting your blood levels checked can determine whether you have a deficiency. Other vitamin D benefits Vitamin D's benefits go beyond bone health. A [2018 review](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/8/2419/htm) found that vitamin D could potentially protect against [the flu virus](/health/vitamin-d-coronavirus). Vitamin D is also important for a healthy pregnancy. Some [research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmwh.13014) suggests that vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with preeclampsia and preterm birth. Before diving into the world of vitamin D supplementation, consult a healthcare professional and get your blood levels tested. This is the only way you'll know if you have a vitamin D deficiency. From there, a pro will be able to determine a dose that's ideal for you. You may have noticed that all the vitamin D supplements on this list surpass the recommended intakes we mentioned earlier. There's also a daily upper limit of [100 mcg (4,000 IU)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/#:~:text=Excess%20vitamin%20D%20can%20also,and%20lactating%20teens%20and%20women.) for children over 9 years old, adults, and folks who are pregnant or breastfeeding. A severe deficiency sometimes requires a larger dose at first, followed by maintenance dosage. When you browse this list or go shopping for a vitamin D supplement, consider your specific needs. Do you prefer capsules, gummies, or liquid? There are a bunch of options, so pick one that works with your current routine and preferences. It's also important to pay close attention to ingredients so you don't choose a product that contains something you're allergic to or that you avoid for personal reasons. Third-party certifications from organizations like [United States Pharmacopeia](https://www.usp.org/) and [NSF International](https://www.nsf.org/certified-products-systems) are a bonus! So, what's the best way to take vitamin D supplements? Even if a supplement says you can take it on an empty stomach, vitamin D seems to do best with a meal. This is especially true when it's paired with a meal higher in fat. [One study](https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01468-3/fulltext) found that adults who took vitamin D with a fat-heavy meal had a 32 percent boost in vitamin D blood levels after 12 hours compared with those taking the supp with a fat-free meal. Should you take vitamin D morning, noon, or night? Honestly, it's up to you and your preferences. There seems to be no \"ideal\" time, although some [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6232868/) claims it may be best to take in the morning rather than at night. That's because increased vitamin D levels may suppress [melatonin](/health/natural-sleep-aids), the hormone responsible for regulating your [snooze cycle](https://www.healthline.com/health/waking-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night). If you're [pregnant](/health/things-not-to-do-while-pregnant), vitamin D is usually recommended as part of your daily supplement routine. You should confirm with your doctor how much is safe for you specifically. Recommended Dietary Allowances for vitamin D - age 12 months or younger: [400 IU (10 mcg)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) - ages 1 to 13: 600 IU (15 mcg) - ages 14 to 70: 600 IU (15 mcg) - age 70 or older: 800 IU (20 mcg) When your body needs vitamin D and you're taking the proper dosage, chances are you won't experience any side effects. On the other hand, because vitamin D is fat-soluble (which means your body stores the excess if you take too much, rather than peeing it out), taking too much in the long term can cause excessive buildup in your body and lead to some unwanted side effects. These could include: - nausea - vomiting - poor appetite - stomach pain - constipation or diarrhea - bone loss - kidney problems TL;DR: Always talk with a healthcare pro before starting a vitamin D supplement (or any supplement, really). If you're not ready to hop on the supplement train, you can get vitamin D from food and sunshine (although it's a little more complicated). Not many foods naturally contain vitamin D, but according to the [National Institutes of Health](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/), fatty fish and fish oils are among the best sources. The top three food sources of vitamin D are: - cod liver oil: 1,360 IU (34 mcg) per tablespoon - rainbow trout: IU (16.2 mcg) per 3 ounces - sockeye salmon: 570 IU (14.2 mcg) per 3 ounces Your skin also absorbs UV rays from the sun and converts them into vitamin D. The amount you get depends on time of day, cloud coverage, skin melanin, and [sunscreen](/health/best-sunscreen-sprays). Some experts say that getting outdoors between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. for [5 to 30 minutes](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) twice per week will lead to sufficient vitamin D synthesis. If the sun ain't shining (or you're a stay-in-the-shade type), a vitamin D supplement can be a super effective way to meet your daily needs. Just remember to check with a healthcare pro before you start taking a vitamin D supplement to get the A-OK and figure out what dosage you need. Once you confirm that you definitely need the D (), you can use our rec list as your starting point for finding the supp that suits you best. "}
