This Practice is for you if you: Are stressed Want ease in your life Want to stop self-sabotaging behavior Think you can't meditate because of an overactive mind Have trouble sitting still Are ready to deepen your spiritual practice Are ready to manifest your desires Learn the Natural, Effortless Meditation Style You'll WANT to Make a Daily Practice. How do I meditate using the Primordial Sound Meditation technique? To practice this type of meditation, you sit comfortably with your back supported and your eyes closed. You allow your mind to settle down to increasingly quieter levels of consciousness by a mantra that is repeated silently in the mind. There is no chanting, focusing, concentrating or contemplating involved - and you don't have to control the mind in any way. The technique feels natural, simple and effortless because you never have to 'try' to meditate. You never feel that you have to try to push thoughts away or concentrate on images. You won't be reliant upon CDs, DVDs, or headphones in order to experience the deepest states of your awareness. You also won't be asked to \"think about this and now visualize that\" to manufacture a good mood. The time will often fly by, and over time you'll learn to meditate almost anywhere, no matter how noisy or busy or bright it is. What if my mind is too crazy to meditate? Or what if I can't sit still? If you feel like your mind is always active, or that your body is too fidgety to sit still, you are actually a perfect candidate for this technique because you don't have to 'try' to stop thinking, try to sit still, or 'try' to do anything for that matter. 'Trying' to meditate is actually what excites the mind and leads to more thinking. Primordial Sound Meditation effortlessly settles the mind and body in the most natural and immediate way. What is the Meditation course like? The technique of Primordial Sound Meditation is taught live and in-person, group settings, and via zoom in a gradual, step-wise format over one or two consecutive days. In addition to attending the daily sessions students are also assigned practice meditations at home. This ensures that everyone will gain enough understanding and experience with both the technique and the underlying principles to become self-sufficient by the end of the course. Here's how the sessions are structured on a typical 3/4-session course: Session 1: (90 minutes) Principles of Meditation. Receive your personal meditation mantra - calculated according to your birthplace, date, and time, and taught to you by Helena. Witness the initiation ceremony to receive your personalized mantra and learn the basic technique. ***Session 1, 2, and 3 maybe completed in the same day, broken up into two parts, with a short 15 min brake. Session 2: (60 minutes) Perfecting Your Practice. Receive expert guidance on the practical aspects of meditation. How the mind moves in meditation. The practice of effortlessly allowing the mind to settle. Session 3: (60 minutes) Deepening Your Practice and Higher States of Consciousness. Make higher states of consciousness your everyday reality - opening new possibilities for physical, emotional, and spiritual growth.
