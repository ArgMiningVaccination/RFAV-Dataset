And what makes up this empty space: energy. Energy is everything, and everything is energy. You, the chair you're sitting on, the phone you're holding, and the crystals you know and love - all of it is vibrating energy. \"Everything is energy and that's all there is to it. This is not philosophy. This is physics.\" -Albert Einstein Just like everything else in the universe, we each have our own unique vibrational frequency. People with higher vibrations radiate kindness, love, peace, and compassion, whereas people with lower vibrations experience more low-vibe emotions like jealousy, anxiety, anger, or fear. Whatever frequency you're at, as a human, your vibration is very unstable and very easily influenced. It changes constantly as we're exposed to other people, social media, the news, traffic, the weather, good news, bad news, our own memories, etc. Crystals, on the other hand, have a super stable energy frequency that doesn't change. Why? They're made up of a fixed, regularly repeating, perfect geometric pattern of molecules. And they maintain their perfect stability with no effort. Exactly the opposite of our constantly changing, non-stable human nature. So why does the stability of a crystal matter? Well, more stable energy = more powerful energy. And powerful energy can influence the energies around it. This is why crystals can so profoundly influence our unstable (less powerful) energy. CRYSTALS AND YOUR CHAKRAS Every crystal, just like every human, has a different energetic frequency. It depends on a few different factors like the size, the composition, and most helpfully, the color. Why does crystal color matter? The colors we see are specific light frequencies. Red, for example, has a much lower frequency than purple. The same goes for our own bodies. If you look at a chakra diagram, the lowest chakra (the root chakra) is shown in red, which aligns with the low vibrational frequency of that chakra. Your crown chakra, on the other hand, is shown in purple, as it's the highest vibration chakra, and the highest vibration color. CHOOSING [CRYSTALS](https://athrbeauty.com/collections/crystals-shop) FOR YOU Because of this vibrational match between like colors, you can usually choose your crystal to match the chakra you want to balance. For example, blue sapphires are good for your throat chakra - which is shown in blue. Just as amber and yellow topaz crystals align with your yellow solar plexus chakra. There are a few exceptions, like rose quartz, which is connected to the green heart chakra, but in general, this is a good place to start. If you're not sure which chakra to focus on, just pick the crystal that your intuition guides you to - the one that you just love. Your own body and intuition know what it needs. WHICH CRYSTALS ALIGN WITH EACH CHAKRA Chakras are the seven energetic centers in the body. They're each connected with different organs and functions in our mind, body, and spirit. The lowest chakra (the root chakra), has the lowest vibrational frequency - and its qualities mirror this. It's concerned with the basic elements of existence - primarily with your safety and physical survival. As you move up the chakra system, you move from the more fundamental emotions to the deeper, higher vibration feelings of joy, love, and creativity. Your chakras can become imbalanced based on influences/experiences in our lives. These imbalances may show up as a physical symptom, emotional disruption, or mental ailment. This is where crystals come in - they can help rebalance any misalignment - returning your energetic centers to the frequencies they're meant to vibrate at.
