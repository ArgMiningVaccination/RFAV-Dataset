All students receiving care within our health center are provided with aftercare instructions that would include the diagnosis and care plan. Students may choose to share this with faculty or employers if they desire, as it is personal information. This policy is based on our limited resources, which are better dedicated to providing health care; the inability for us to make valid determinations about illnesses or injuries students may have effectively managed through self-care; and our commitment to student privacy. We suggest that students dialogue with faculty members regarding their circumstances for missed classes or assignments. This policy is consistent with the recommendations of the American College Health Association and is similar to other colleges and universities. It is respectful of students and their responsibilities, promotes trust among students and faculty, and allows students more time to devote to their studies. - Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy A healthy campus community is a vibrant and inspiring place to work, study and live. It celebrates the contributions of all and welcomes a diversity of ideas, backgrounds and experiences.
