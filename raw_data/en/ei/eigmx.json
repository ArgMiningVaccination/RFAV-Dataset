In the West, we often see older age as something to be ashamed of, rather than revered and respected. There is no reason why - if we look after ourselves and stay fit, eat a well-balanced diet and stay positive and optimistic - we shouldn't live to a \"ripe old age\" full of health and vitality. Using aromatherapy as a part of a \"Preventative Health Care Strategy\" can be a really powerful and enjoyable way to bring comfort and calm, as well as boosting circulation, immunity, and muscle tone. Many specific health conditions associated with old age can respond well to aromatherapy treatments. There are however some particular pointers to take into account when working with more mature clients when health has become an issue: - Remember using essential oils in different forms may be indicated - not just in massage - e.g. Lavender and Chamomile compresses for inflamed arthritic joints. Vapourising oils can also be a useful additional adjunct to your treatment plan. - A \"full body\" massage may be too much for a person in later life, who is more fragile - so focusing on their face, hands and feet may be more enjoyable, effective but not exhausting. They may also prefer not to have to undress fully, as this can be hard work. - As skin can often become more sensitive, use 1% concentration in massage oils and creams rather than 2.5%. - Remember to dab hands and feet dry after massage to prevent slipping. - With aromatic baths, recommend bath salts rather than bath oils which can leave the bath dangerously slippy. - Foot baths can be useful, comforting and very pleasurable if baths are difficult due to mobility problems. - When massaging older clients, remember their skin may be more delicate or fragile, and they may bruise more easily. Use a little more oil than usual to help prevent damage and ensure a gentle fluid action. - Always check if your client is on any medication - e.g. Warfarin will predispose clients to bruising. Some essential oils may also interact with certain medications. If your client is suffering from any medical condition or taking medication you should discuss treatment with their GP before continuing. - If your client is suffering from dementia, or similar \"informed consent\" may be required before continuing. Essential oils for the elderly Here are some common age-related health conditions and the essential oils that can help. Dementia / Alzheimer's Disease Essential oils are thought to help with improving sleep, decreasing anxiety and agitation, and improving some cognitive function for dementia patients. Oils most commonly recommended are [Lavender](https://www.baseformula.com/lavender-french-essential-oil), Melissa, Rosemary, Lemon and Sweet Orange. Various small-scale studies have concluded that Lavender and [Melissa](https://www.baseformula.com/melissa-true-essential-oil) have positive effects for reducing agitation and difficult behaviour with no side effects. Another study looked at diffusing [Lemon](https://www.baseformula.com/lemon-essential-oil) and Rosemary essential oils in the morning and Lavender and Orange at night, concluding that the use of these oils can help to improve cognitive function. Other studies have also looked at the benefits of physical massage (touch) and again, although the studies were small, patients were reported to be calmer and less disruptive after massage. Circulatory Problems / High Blood Pressure There are lots of factors that can contribute to poor circulation as we age. These include diabetes, smoking and the fact that older people can become far less physically active. Poor circulation can cause problems such as swollen legs and feet (oedema), numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, cold hands and feet, varicose veins, ulcers, memory problems, digestive problems and fatigue. Rubefacient essential oils such as [Black Pepper](https://www.baseformula.com/black-pepper-essential-oil), Ginger, Juniper, Marjoram and Rosemary can help warm the skin and increase blood flow. Detoxifying oils such as [Fennel](https://www.baseformula.com/fennel-sweet-essential-oil), Juniper and Lemon can help with fluid retention and Cypress is one of the best choices for varicose veins. High blood pressure is another common circulatory disorder in the elderly which can be dangerous if continually raised. A soothing massage with calming 'hypotensive' essential oils such as [Clary Sage](https://www.baseformula.com/clary-sage-essential-oil), Lavender, Marjoram or Ylang Ylang can be a lovely way to help lower the blood pressure and aid relaxation. These oils will also aid sleep! Pain Relief - Joints & Muscles Arthritis and painful, inflamed joints are common problems for the elderly. Cool compresses with Lavender, Peppermint and [Chamomile](https://www.baseformula.com/chamomile-blue-essential-oil) work well for hot inflamed joints. You can also blend cooling Aloe Vera Gel with Clary Sage, Lavender, Marjoram and Peppermint and gently massage to stimulate circulation and reduce pain and stiffness. For muscular tension try a gentle massage or warm compress with Lavender, [Marjoram](https://www.baseformula.com/marjoram-sweet-essential-oil) and Frankincense. Fighting Infection Elderly clients can be more susceptible to infections such as coughs, colds and flu. This is because immunity weakens with age. They may also have other health conditions that increase the risk of infection. Essential oils can help here in two different ways. Firstly, by stimulating and increasing the body's immune response, and secondly, by directly fighting the bacteria or viruses themselves. Some essential oils such as Bergamot, Eucalyptus, Lavender, [Manuka](https://www.baseformula.com/manuka-essential-oil), Ravensara and Tea Tree do both- making them great choices to use in massage or in aromatherapy diffusers. Memory / Mood Aromatherapy oils can help stimulate memory by triggering past recollections. Certain stimulating oils such as [Rosemary](https://www.baseformula.com/rosemary-essential-oil), Basil, Peppermint, Black Pepper and Lemon can increase alertness, improve memory and lift the mood. Anti-depressant oils that comfort and calm include: Neroli, Benzoin, Frankincense and [Orange](https://www.baseformula.com/orange-sweet-essential-oil). Many older people receive little or no physical nurturing or touch at all, and loving care and touch through massage can lead to deep soothing comfort and feelings of security and safety. Sleep Problems Many older people complain of poor sleep. Common issues are light sleep, frequent waking and feeling tired during the day. A few drops of sedative essential oil before bed - on a tissue by the pillow or vapourised - can help ease the mind and aid restful sleep. Lavender, Marjoram, Chamomile, Orange, [Ylang Ylang](https://www.baseformula.com/ylang-ylang-extra-essential-oil) or Sandalwood can be used - be guided by individual preference. Whatever the complaint, remember to treat each person as an individual not a disease, and aim to help improve their quality of life by using essential oils and \"the power of touch\" in whatever form of application is most appropriate and enjoyable as well as effective. Aromatherapy can almost always be used alongside conventional medicine, but communication is vital to ensure safety and appropriate practice. Family and carers will often really enjoy learning from your expertise and can be drawn into the care plan and continue using your blends regularly in-between visits.
