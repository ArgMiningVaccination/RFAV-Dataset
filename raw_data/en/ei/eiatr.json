At the beginning of February, a single-dose of Ad26.COV2.S was found to be 67 percent [effective](https://pharmanewsintel.com/news/jjs-covid-19-vaccine-66-effective-in-moderate-severe-cases) in preventing moderate-to-severe and critical COVID-19 14 days after vaccination and 66 percent effective 28 days after vaccination. The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial enrolled 43,783 participants, of which 468 had symptomatic cases of COVID-19. Researchers measured the co-primary endpoints 14 and 28 days after vaccination. Johnson & Johnson explained that efficacy against COVID-19 increased over time, with no cases in vaccinated participants reported after Day 49. Additionally, Ad26.COV2.S significantly helped infected individuals requiring medical intervention, including hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. There were no reported cases among participants who received the vaccine. The most common adverse events were pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, and nausea. And most of these side effects were mild to moderate in severity and lasted one to two days. FDA noted that under the authorization, it is mandatory for Janssen Biotech and vaccination providers to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) any serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, and cases of the coronavirus that result in hospitalization or death. Vaccination providers must also report all vaccine administration errors to VAERS, including a summary and analysis of all identified vaccine administration errors in monthly safety reports submitted to FDA. Johnson & Johnson has already begun shipping Ad26.COV.2 and expects to deliver enough single-shot vaccines to enable the full vaccination of more than 20 million people in the US by the end of March. Additionally, the company plans to deliver 100 million doses to the US during the first half of 2021. \"This milestone follows a year of incredible work by our dedicated teams and unprecedented collaboration with health leaders around the world - all of whom shared a goal of bringing a single-shot vaccine to the public,\" Alex Gorsky, chairman and chief executive officer at Johnson & Johnson, said in a [press release](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-by-u-s-fda-for-emergency-usefirst-single-shot-vaccine-in-fight-against-global-pandemic) following the authorization. \"We will do everything we can to help bring this pandemic to an end, in the United States and throughout the world,\" Gorsky continued.
