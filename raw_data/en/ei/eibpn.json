However, no rationale for how to prioritizeservice shut down and patient care exists. A consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/immunology services.

During the ongoingpandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care.

Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextualconsideration. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system.

This means health care workers caring for a patient with suspected COVID-19 should wear a gown, gloves, and either anN95 respirator plus face shield and goggles or a powered air- purifying respirator; however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also notes that a face mask may be substituted for an N95respirator if one is not available, and a negative pressure room may be reserved for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. 1,2 However, this information is fluid and may continue to change.

This is prefaced by stating that such measures would be for emergency purposes only, such as atthe present time, where the US president has declared a nationalstate of emergency. 8As COVID-19 becomes more pervasive, recommended and mandated social distancing becomes more pronounced. Several countries have initiated widespread quar-antine measures to try to contain and mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. During a pandemic where a national state of emergency has been declared and quarantine measures are rec-ommended or mandated, \"red zone \"measures must be consid- ered. 2,7,8A helpful view of a strati ed approach is presented in Figure 2 . Much of what follows relates to \"red zone \"operations. Some of the suggestion below may be most appropriate for a greater level of social distancing and quarantine than exists in the moment, and, as such, the clinician must view these as condi-tional recommendations to be incorporated within context-specic, evolving situations. Again, we want to ensure that all readers understand that this is a suggested framework, and furthermore a framework only tobe considered in the setting of a global emergency during a time when nations, societies, and institutions are facing drastic pandemic measures in a \"red zone \"situation. Ultimately, any decision to reduce or shift service resides within the sole au- tonomy of the clinician, their practice, their health care system, and their community.

Conclusions. A pandemic response during a global emer- gency is a highly unusual and atypical circumstance from busi- ness as usual. The framework described herein represents acourse of action in a highly speci c and temporary situation, necessary only in a most extreme and improbable circumstance, where there is a state of emergency and a pandemic risk that outweighs the risk of deferral of an of ce visit for the allergic condition. Please keep in mind that these are suggestions that must be conditioned on individual \"on the ground \"circum- stances. They are not mandates or forced actions. The decision toenact any of these measures rests with the clinician and the in- dividual health care system. These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust services tomitigate risk to both medical staff and patients during theongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged. Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. We acknowledgethat taking actions to limit face-to-face access may have nancial implications in terms of lost revenue, xed operating costs, and unclear reimbursement for telehealth and that advocacy on thepart of professional organizations may be both appropriate and necessary to leverage some share of federal resources during this pandemic. 8If nothing else, we can fall back on the old adage \"remember your training. \"We are some of the most highly trained and adept medical specialists in the world. We can and will persevere through any challenge that the specialty faces. INTRODUCTION Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) has exhibited a pattern of pandemic spread in a few shortmonths, as countries and communities struggle to rapidly design effective strategies to prevent spread of the novel coronavirus. The virus has been named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes\"coronavirus disease 2019 \"(COVID-19). 1,2China rst noti ed the World Health Organization of several cases of a human respiratory illness that were linked to an open seafood and live-stock market in the city of Wuhan in December 2019, which appears to have originated in chrysanthemum bats. 1,3Worldwide community transmission is now evident, and it is clear thatSARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus. 3Cases have beenidenti ed across the globe, and on 1 cruise ship alone more than 700 infections were reported, demonstrating the high level of potential contagion.1,4The spectrum of disease ranges from se- vere respiratory illness and fatality from these complications(particularly in the elderly and those with comorbidities) to asymptomatic spread, 1,5,6with the proclivity of SARS-CoV-2 for person-to-person transmission in asymptomatic individuals pre-senting one of the most vexing problems from a public health standpoint. 1Of note, based on data at the time of drafting this document, serious illness appears to occur in approximately 14%to 16% of cases. 2,6However, we cannot stress enough that these arefluid situations that may change hourly. Given the rapid and pervasive spread, the World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern onJanuary 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and on March 13, 2020, the president of the United States declared a national emergency in the United States, consistent with similaractions taken in several other countries. 7,8Information is sparse in some instances, and inconsistent in others, but there is anticipated widespread caseload across the North America and anurgent need to match the pace of the outbreak to the capacity of national health care systems to serve the needs of affected in- dividuals in an urgent and timely manner ( Figure 1 ). It is incumbent on each physician to monitor the day-to-day evolu-tion of the pandemic in their region, and to be prepared to implement the recommendations of authorities and experts. The situation is changing quickly and requires a rapid, flexible, and informed response. BIOLOGY, EPIDEMIOLOGY, CLINICAL PRESENTATION, AND MANAGEMENT Although this is more fully summarized elsewhere, the biology of the virus is of some interest. Please see this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org for additional information on biology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and management of COVID-19. The practicing allergist should keep in mind that there is overlap with allergic rhinitis, in fluenza, viral upper respi- ratory tract infection, and asthma in the early stages with respect to certain upper respiratory tract symptoms that only later progress to more clearly de ned COVID-19 symptoms. The overall case-fatality rate of patients with COVID-19 pre- senting for medical evaluation has been estimated to be around 2.3%, but it is highly variable and may be as high as 8% to 15%in higher risk populations. 1,6,10Health care workers are not immune, as noted by the nding that 3.8% of cases occurred in health care workers. Of 1716 COVID-19 infections in healthcare workers, 14.8% were classi ed as severe, and 5 deaths were reported (case-fatality rate, 0.3%). 6There is some speculation that insuf cient access to testing and intensive care services (secondary to equipment and space shortages) may contribute tosome of the fatality rate variation. Again, it should be emphasized that data reporting and event rates are fluid and changing rapidly. Of note, fatality rates may actually be much lower when mild andasymptomatic cases are considered. PREVENTION AND CONTROL MEASURES FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS Although vaccine development is underway, it is unlikely that a vaccine will be available in 2020.1Key strategies for containing the virus and limiting its spread include identifying andJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT MONTH 20204 SHAKER ET ALquarantining infected individuals and those at high risk for infection. However, this approach is limited by a lack of timely and accurate testing and overlap of mild COVID-19 with sea- sonal viral infections. The Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) has recommended the use of personal pro- tective equipment by health care workers including standard, contact, and airborne precautions and the use of eye protection.This means health care workers caring for a patient with sus- pected COVID-19 should wear a gown, gloves, and either an N95 respirator plus face shield and goggles or a powered air-purifying respirator; however, the CDC also notes that a face mask may be substituted for an N95 respirator if one is not available. At present a negative pressure room may be reserved forpatients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. 1,2As is with any of this information, this is fluid and may continue to change. Commonsense strategies are important in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and are detailed in Table E1 in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org.2,11During the COVID-19 pandemic the concept of social distancing has also been incorporated into prevention strategies, with the CDCrecommending avoiding close contact ( <6 ft). 2,11 During the pandemic, self-quarantine of asymptomatic health care providers resulting from exposure to sick patients or familymembers may limit their ability to provide care. Telehealth mayprovide an additional resource in these circumstances, and pro- viders may consider implementing systems to facilitate virtual care from home. EMERGENCY SOCIAL DISTANCING \u2014 PRIORITIZING CARE IN THE EVENT OF AMBULATORY SERVICE RATIONING In the presence of a highly contagious global pandemic, de- cisions will need to be considered regarding the short-term ra-tioning of services. It is important to note that many allergy/ immunology services are elective and can be managed without face-to-face interaction or deferred outright for short periods oftime. Not only will these considerations be important for patient health and safety, but it will also be important to consider those health care workers who are within the high-risk group asspecied by the CDC. A strong argument can be made that we must diligently protect our workforce by realigning present pri- orities to limit face-to-face patient interactions where possible, particularly for health care workers. 12Relevant, though admit- tedly 16-year-old, data from a US allergy/immunology 2004 survey found that the average age of the allergy and immunology physician workforce was 53 years in 2004 versus 51 years in1999, with physicians working longer before retiring. 12 To provide an approach to triaging allergy/immunology services during the COVID-19 pandemic, a consensus-based ad-hocexpert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the UnitedStates and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily adjust allergy/immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, usingan adapted modi ed Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. A hierarchy for understanding these scenarios is detailed in Figure 2 , which depicts a graded approach to how allergy and immunology services may need to be adjusted during an emerging pandemic. As COVID-19 becomes more pervasive, recommended and mandated social distancing become morepronounced. Several countries have initiated widespreadquarantine measures to try to contain and mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Drastic measures were initially taken in Wuhan, limiting travel, and on March 9, 2020, the Italian government released a decree prohibiting movement in public places exceptfor\"justiable reasons \"such as commuting to work, obtaining basic necessities (ie, food shopping), and for health emergencies. The decree cancelled sporting events and public gatherings andclosed schools, universities, and recreational facilities through April 3. 13On March 13, France announced plans to close nonessential businesses and Spain announced a nationwidelockdown. 14Currently throughout North America, there have already been widespread cancellations and postponements of large gatherings, including most major sporting events andleagues. A helpful view of a strati ed approach is presented in Figure 2 . In this context, \"green zone \"represents normal operations, \"yellow zone \"denes operations during emergence of a conta- gious pandemic illness with signs of possible community spread, \"orange zone \"relates to a pandemic with a state, local, and/or national emergency declared, and \"red zone \"would be imple- mented in the setting of a declared emergency with full or partial quarantine measures recommended for all citizens (ie, school closings or government-imposed social distancing restrictions). During a pandemic in which a global health emergency has been declared, \"red zone \"measures must be considered. 2,7,8The remainder of this document deals with a rationale to enact such \"red zone \"measures. It must be explicitly stated that the following framework serves only as a suggestion and should only be considered within the context of a global emergency during a time when nations, societies, and institutions are facing drasticpandemic measures in a \"red zone \"situation. The recommen- dations must also be considered with the understanding that normal services will eventually resume, and that such recom-mendations only represent contingency plans for prioritization of staff, space, and patients, with an expected timeline of 6 months or less. Thus, the remainder of this document aims to makerecommendations regarding how clinicians can consider priori-tizing who needs to be seen, weighing the risks and bene ts of what that may involve in terms of risk of infection, space con- straints, and staff availability. Ultimately, any decision to reduceor shift service resides within the sole autonomy of the clinician, their practice, their health care system, and their community. Much of what follows relates to \"red zone \"operations. Some of the suggestion below may not be required at the moment, and as such the clinician must view these as conditional recom- mendations to be incorporated within context-speci c, evolving situations. TELEHEALTH AND OTHER METHODS OF VIRTUAL ENCOUNTERS \u2014EXPANDING SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC Telehealth can be central in delivering allergy/immunology ser- vices within a risk-strati ed context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Telehealth has the potential to help with social distancing. Several advantages that telehealth offers are as follows: (1) it can limit exposure of providers to potentially infected patients, particularly ifthey are older or have health problems, (2) it can reduce exposure of patients, many of whom have conditions such as asthma or immu- nodeciency disorders, to other infected patients, and (3) it can provide access to rapid evaluation for potential COVID-19J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME -, NUMBER -SHAKER ET AL 5infection, reducing the likelihood that they will go to an urgent care clinic or emergency department where they have increased risk of virus exposure. To provide telehealth services to patients it is important to remember that the provider must be licensed topractice medicine in the state where the patient is located (although some regulations are in flux during the national emergency). Please see this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org for additional information on telehealth. 15-23The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the American College of Al- lergy, Asthma & Immunology telemedicine/telehealth toolkits can be valuable resources.17,24 Although telehealth may be a valuable and critical resource, challenges will include triaging patient diagnoses and severity to provide immediate access to services to patients with more acuteneed. 25-29For example, a patient requiring assessment of possible idiopathic anaphylaxis would likely require more immediate access to this service than a patient needing follow-up for well-controlledasthma or allergic rhinitis. In other circumstances discussed below, patients with well-controlled allergic disease may be able to appro- priately defer both face-to-face and telehealth visits. Clinicians willalso need to be aware of potential pitfalls of virtual care. For example,the case of unstable asthma in a patient with poor perception of dyspnea or during a signi cant exacerbation. However, telehealth can also be an excellent tool for many allergic conditions for thosewith less severe and stable conditions, such as in those with seasonal allergies who need a brief reassessment and re ll of their pre- scriptions before their allergy season. In the current context, espe-cially if formal telehealth services are not available, virtual care may also need to be dispensed using telephone, electronic medical record patient portal messaging, and e-visits, including in the event of ab-solute emergencies. For many situations, incorporating phone triageas arst step may be helpful, particularly in areas where the clinical situation may lack clarity as to the acuity or pressing need for the patient to be seen, and then working toward maximizing telehealthor other means of virtual care where social distancing can be pre- served and health care needs can still be met. This document seeks to provide a rationale to be considered for such instances. As a general approach, no recommendations will be an ideal t for every unique clinician, situation, or practice setting. Each clinician must use their judgment in making decisions about which servicesmay be deferred, which may be offered using virtual care, and which will require in-person care. The goal of this document is to provide a resource for consideration in rather unusual circumstances, ratherthan to give any directives. Speci c conditions are discussed below. Tables are provided for suggested service adjustments for patients with speci c conditions. Specific conditions Asthma. For asthma-speci c recommendations on service reduction, please see Table I ,and for an approach to triaging an asthma exacer- bation in this setting, see Figure 3 . Asthma is a major health problem around the globe.30Because SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory pathogen, it is important to know what risk patients with asthma have in this time of a COVID-19 pandemic. There are relatively few data at thistime to demonstrate a speci c increased risk for COVID-19 from asthma, or an increased disease pathology in patients with asthma infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, this association could evolve.Early published data from China noted that asthma was not a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease. One study of 140 patients with COVID-19 found none with asthma, 31and in a larger study of 1099 hospitalized patients, asthma was not described.32In this largerstudy, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) was noted in pa- tients hospitalized with COVID-19, but the rate of patients with COPD who had COVID-19 (1.1%) was lower than the rate of COPD in the general Chinese population (which is at least 10%).33 Data from Korea also indicate that asthma is not a relevant co- morbidity.10Together these data suggest that the risk of severe COVID-19 may not be dramatically elevated in those with asthmaor COPD. However, these data are based on hospitalized patientsand may have signi cant limitations due to selection and reporting bias. It is also important to note that asthma appears underdiagnosed and underreported in China, with an estimated prevalence of only4.2%. 34The actual risk of disease in those with asthma or COPD within the broader Chinese population or those of non-Chinese background is not known, and may evolve with additional datareporting. Beyond the direct risk of the infection itself, there is also a risk of experiencing an asthma exacerbation triggered by coronavirusinfection. Previous pandemic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) have not been associated with asthma exacerbations, but there are nonpandemic coronavirusesthat circulate annually and have been reported to cause asthma ex-acerbations. 35,36Nonetheless, it is imperative that patients with asthma implement appropriate steps to ensure their asthma is under control to limit the chance for a more serious exacerbation. Knowledge about the potential use of corticosteroids in treating COVID-19 is evolving. Currently, the World Health Organization and the CDC recommend that in the general population withCOVID-19, systemic corticosteroids should be avoided because of a potential for prolonged viral replication that was observed in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. However, thereis also acknowledgment that there may be a role for systemic cor-ticosteroids when indicated for other reasons, such as septic shock. 2,37-39For example, in a study of 309 intensive care unit patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 151received corticosteroids acutely, and those who received corticoste- roids were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (93.4% vs 76.6%; P<.0001), had higher 90-day crude mortality (74.2% vs 57.6%; P\u00bc.002), and had delayed viral clearance. Of note, mor- tality rates did not differ by corticosteroid use when time-varying confounders. 38Approximately 20% to 30% of hospi- talized patients with COVID-19 have pneumonia and may require intensive care for respiratory support2,39; thus, it is important to appreciate that corticosteroids may have distinct roles in treatinglung injury versus airway in flammation. Recently, Russel et al 40 summarized current evidence in relation to the use of corticoste- roids for mitigating lung injury from coronaviruses and concluded that there is likely to be a lack of ef cacy in COVID-19 lung injury. However, it is important to differentiate between the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 and their use as a controller medication for the management of a chronic disease, suchas asthma. As mentioned, it is most important to maintain asthma control, and the lack of patients with comorbid asthma being noted in COVID-19 studies or data reporting suggests that patients withasthma may not be at a greatly increased risk of more serious dis-ease\u2014even with the use of inhaled corticosteroids as part of a controller regimen. In fact, it may be more likely that a patient with asthma would have an exacerbation from other causes, includingseasonal pollen exposure or a virus other than SARS-CoV-2 if they stopped regular use of indicated controller therapy based on best evidence. An exacerbation could require them to enter the healthcare system, which would put them at increased risk of beingJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT MONTH 20206 SHAKER ET ALexposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic. Until studies in patients with asthma with SARS-CoV-2 have been performed andshow evidence to the contrary, a prudent recommendation would be to continue to manage asthma according to current asthma guideline ebased recommendations. 30 Of note, nebulizer use is discouraged unless essential during this pandemic, because the use of nebulized therapy is more likely to aerosolize SARS-CoV-2 and increase the risk of contagion. As such, asthma therapy delivered by metered dose inhaler would be mostappropriate both in the health care setting and at home. 41-43 Methodologically sound and high-quality evidence supports the administration number of biologic agents \u2014targeting IL-5, IL-4/ IL-13, and IgE \u2014for appropriately selected patients with refractory moderate to severe persistent asthma.43There is no evidence that suggests that immune response to COVID-19 will be impaired inpatients with asthma treated with anti eIL-5, anti eIL-5Ra, anti eIL-4/IL-13, or anti-IgE medications. In the absence of any data indi- cating a potential for harm, it would be reasonable to continueadministration of biologic agents during the COVID-19 pandemicin patients for whom such agents are clearly indicated and have been effective. 44,45 In summary, understanding of the intersection between asthma and COVID-19 is evolving. There are currently scant data to indicate the degree of risk (or protection) from disease, and no data to support strong recommendations for or against speci c asthma treatments. Until more information suggests otherwise, it is strongly recommended that physicians continue to manage asthma according to existing accepted asthma guidelines.30Ensuring that those with asthma have their condition under optimal control is the bestdeterrent against a poor outcome from any viral respiratory tract infection, and there is a high likelihood that this recommendation also extends to SARS-CoV-2. Allergic rhinitis. Under red zone circumstances, there are no recommendations for prioritizing the evaluation of new patients or return visits of established patients with allergic rhinitis. Face-to-face visits for evaluation and management of patients with allergic rhinitiscan generally be postponed or shifted to telehealth visits for initiation or monitoring of care as an alternative. Therefore, with rare exception (or \"unless there are extenuating circumstances \"), service reduction for allergic rhinitis would be strongly recommended as pandemic manage-ment and isolation measures continue to escalate. Although telehealth and phone triage do remain as available options, telehealth utiliza- tion comes with the caveat that other diagnoses may need theselimited resources with higher priority. Skin testing to inhalants may not be appropriate; it may be prudent to postpone such testing or to perform in vitro serum speci c IgE testing as an alternative, with the understanding that this would also entail entering a health care environment for performance of phlebotomy. Such patients may be better managed via avoidance measures and administration ofmedication(s) as indicated on the basis of best evidence. 46High COVID risk Low asthma severity riskAppropriately tested per CDC and state protocols with telehealth management of asthma High COVID risk High asthma severity risk or uncertain diagnosisNeed for face-to-face evalua/g415on with poten/g415al availability of PPE and pressure isola/g415on if an aerosol genera/g415ng procedure is an/g415cipated Low COVID risk Low asthma severity riskTelehealth management Low COVID risk High asthma severity risk or uncertain diagnosisNeed for face-to-face evalua/g415on which may occur in primary care or allergy clinic FIGURE 3. T riage approach to the patient with an asthma exac- erbation during a pandemic. PPE, Personal protective equipment.TABLE I. Service adjustment for asthma The following hierarchy of service adjustments could be considered: 1) Do not \"step down \"any daily controller medicine on any patient during the COVID-19 pandemic, unless this is clearly favorable from an individualized standpoint, with careful consideration of the balance between bene t and harm/burden, and the patient has had the opportunity to participate in the medical decision-making process. Consider use of virtual care resources. 2) Consider prioritizing the care of high-risk patients, as de ned by the CDC/WHO in the particular epidemic, over other groups. COVID-19 infection, from the currently available information, appears to have a milder course and less aggressive attack rate in children, including children with asthm a. 3) For patients with asthma of any severity who are exhibiting worsening control or an acute exacerbation, follow COVID-19 screening protocols to determine their risks of COVID-19 infection and need for COVID-19 testing at a designated facility ( Figure 3 ). If their exacerbation is mild and can be managed by virtual care, this is encouraged. If the exacerbation is more than mild, COVID-19 risk must be considered in determining whether a face-to-face visit is necessary, and what location (of ce vs ED with negative pressure rooms available if the patient will be undergoing an aerosol- generating procedure) is most appropriate.2If the allergy/immunology of ce does not have currently recommended personal protective equipment available, it would be recommended that no patients with a copotential for an asthma exacerbation and COVID-19 be seen at that of ce; the patient should instead be seen at another facility capable of COVID-19 isolation that is also staffed and equipped to assess and manage asthma. 4) Postpone face-to-face routine follow-up visits with any patients with mild to moderate or well-controlled asthma. Consider virtual care options for these patients, including telehealth, to ensure that there is continuity of care. 5) Postpone all face-to-face visits for patients with asthma of any severity who have been well-controlled in the past 6-12 mo, including no record of E D visits, who have had /C201 oral steroid bursts or hospitalizations in the immediate 6 mo, or /C202 exacerbations in the past year. Use virtual care options to make sure they have an adequate supply of asthma medications and to dispense care if entering into a time of year where the patient typically struggleswith control. 6) Prioritize virtual care to assess patients with asthma of any severity who have required ED care or been hospitalized for an exacerbation within the past 3-6 mo, have received /C212 oral steroid courses in the past 3-6 mo, or have required /C211 dose escalations/additions of any daily controller medication in the past 3-6 mo. 7) Suspend screening of any patient for entry into asthma clinical trials. 8) For patients currently in a research protocol, follow directions of the sponsor, and consider using virtual care resources as permitted. ED, Emergency department; WHO , World Health Organization.J ALLERGY Allergen immunotherapy and biologic therapy are valued treatment options for the care of many allergic/immunologic disorders.47However, in some cases they represent alternatives to other front-line medical management, and in some settings are a preference-sensitive care option as a rst- line therapy. For speci c recommendations on service reduction for immunotherapy and biologics, please see Table II . Food allergy, food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome, eosinophilic esophagitis, drug allergy,and anaphylaxis. For speci c recommendations on service reduction for food allergy, food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome, eosinophilicesophagitis, drug allergy, and anaphylaxis, please see Table III .M a n y patients with food allergy, eosinophilic esophagitis, and anaphylaxis are generally healthy, with the exception of other allergic comorbiditiessuch as asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema. With limited exception, most of the care of these conditions would reasonably qualify under temporarily nonessential ambulatory elective services, which could bedelayed or deferred in the short- to intermediate-term (a few weeks to even a few months) with no anticipated signi cant serious untoward effects. Most of the care for patients with these conditions could foregoany face-to-face visits in the short-term, and if necessary be addressedthrough virtual care until the pandemic subsides. Many such patients could likely forego any care in this time interval. When considering what is critically necessary, routine food allergy follow-up visits andmany new referrals should be considered to fall under a more elective category, where such visits could be handled via telehealth, potentially. Food challenges, with limited exceptions, would also follow suit. In the setting of a pandemic with quarantine measures, unless there is a critical acute nutritional need for introduction of a key nutrient, it is likely that all food challenges would be deferred . Research visits for ongoing study protocols and food allergy immunotherapy visits for initiation andescalation could also be delayed, with the possible exception of food challenge visits at the end of a study interval where delay would risk influencing the primary/secondary outcomes. However, sponsors are likely issuing their own directives for handling this, which should befollowed unless the local facility issues guidance that supersedes that of the sponsor with regard to access to space or staff. Where possible, it is recommended that there be planning to provide telehealth visitswithout testing to provide essential diagnostic management and makemedication adjustments, or a plan to address this through phone triage. Allergic skin disorders. For speci c recommendations on service reduction for allergic skin disorder, please see Table IV .I n patients with urticaria, angioedema, and atopic dermatitis, most visitscan be considered under the nonurgent category where face-to-face care can be postponed or conducted via phone triage or tele- health. 52,55Nearly all follow-up visits could fall under this guidance. Use of telehealth, e-visits, or digital photography can be of use to helpvisualize any rash, which can reduce the need for face-to-face visits. For patients with known hereditary angioedema who develop an acute episode, triage to region-speci c urgent or emergency care facilities is appropriate. If it is possible to obtain on-demand therapy for home administration, this would also be recommended. Immunodeficiency. For speci c recommendations on service reduction for immunode ciency, please see Table V . Immunode ciency is one of the few potential areas of service where exceptions may haveto be made to continue to provide routine face-to-face services. These patients may be at a higher baseline increased risk from COVID-19 complications, community-acquired infections, andnosocomial infections; however, the degree of this risk is still a matter of speculation. 61,62As is the rationale with other conditions, telehealth should be encouraged and certain care can be postponed,but face-to-face care may be necessary for more severe illness. ManyTABLE II. Service adjustment for immunotherapy and biologics The following hierarchy of service adjustments could be considered: 1) For patients with allergic rhinitis, immunotherapy should notbe initiated unless there are unusual circumstances, such as a patient with unavoidable exposure to a trigger that has resulted in anaphylaxis or asthma-related hospitalization, where no other alternative is feasible for the short- to intermediate-term. 2) Although home allergen immunotherapy may be considered within a paradigm of shared decision making in highly exceptional circumstances, it does represent a departure from general standards of care. However, for patients receiving VIT who are clearly informed of risks and bene ts and have completed a process of informed consent, have not experienced a prior systemic reaction, do not have comorbidities or medication use that would makeanaphylaxis more severe/dif cult to treat, are appropriately educated on the process of appropriate storage, handling, and administration of allergen immunotherapy, and have self-injectable epinephrine at home, home administration could be a consideration during the pandemic. 47 3) For patients currently receiving inhalant allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis, consider schedule modi cation (eg, widening the interval between injections to every 2 wk for buildup and every 6 wk for maintenance), or suspending treatment until the pandemic measures have been lifted, with theexception of patients with unavoidable exposure to a trigger that has resulted in anaphylaxis, or hospitalization for asthma-related consequences where no other alternative is feasible for the short-to-intermediate term. 4) There should be no change in service for initiation or buildup of VIT in patients with a history of a systemic reaction to venom, because this is a life- threatening condition, and this is an essential service. Patients on maintenance VIT can be spaced to every 2-3 mo, if they have been on maintenance forat least a year. 48,49 5) No VIT should be initiated or continued for patients with either large local reactions or a history of an isolated cutaneous systemic reaction.48,49 6) Initiation of biologics should be done at home with visiting health care services. If this is not available or possible, then in-of ce initiation can occur, preferably with a maximum of 1-2 visits and then transition to home administration in the overwhelming majority of cases, unless there are unusualcircumstances or if this is not feasible. 50Although omalizumab has been approved in Europe for home administration after uneventful administration of 4 doses in clinic, currently home administration of omalizumab in the United States would represent a departure from usual care, and, as such, risks an d benets should be clearly discussed and informed consent documented.44,45 7) For patients on maintenance doses of biologics, consider converting the patient to a pre lled syringe for potential home administration if this is available (home administration was recently shown to be safe and cost-effective for anti eIL-5 and anti-IgE therapy50), vs the risk/bene t of missing 1 or several doses. However, some patients may need to be seen face-to-face for biologic administration, which underscores the need for resource prioritization as outlined above. VIT, Venom immunotherapy.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT MONTH 20208 SHAKER ET ALof the deprioritizations of other routine care is to preserve unfettered access to care for patients with higher acuity conditions. The In- ternational Patient Organization for Primary Immunode ciencies has recently published a joint statement together with EuropeanSociety of Infectious Diseases, International Nursing Group for Immunode ciencies, Asian Paci c Society for Immunode ciencies, Arab for Primary Immunode ciency, African Society for Immunode ciency, Clinical Immunology Society, Latin American Society for Immunode ciencies, and South East Asia Primary Im- munode ciency Network on the COVID-19 epidemic. The state- ment covers general and primary immunode ciencyespecicprecautions. 61It is essential for patients on immunoglobulin ther- apy to continue their regular treatment. These products are safe and will protect from other infections. According to a statement from the Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association, there is no risk of trans-mission of this virus in these products. 63 Shared decision making Shared decision making is a patient-centered process whereby the patient and their clinician have a discussion regarding care or treatment options, in which patient values and preferences areconsidered in the context of the medical decision-making process toTABLE III. Service adjustment for food allergy , food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome, eosinophilic esophagitis, drug allergy , and anaphylaxis The following hierarchy of service adjustments could be considered: 1) Reschedule all food/drug challenges except for the following scenarios: a) Milk, soy, or hydrolysate formula introduction in an infant in whom there is a critical nutritional need for this to be introduced to provide a calori c source, and there is a history prompting safety concerns such that this could not be introduced at home. Examples may include milk or soy FPIES or EoE cases or where either formula is being considered as the alternative source and there is strong parental preference to not change to elementalformula; concern for hydrolysate tolerance in a milk-allergic infant; or cases where there is highly suspected milk/soy allergy misdiagnosis that i s resulting in such formula being withheld and there is an urgency for directly supervised reintroduction. Elemental formulas could also be empirical ly considered. b) Other critical essential grains/nutrients in an infant that have been unnecessarily withheld because of suspected misdiagnosis and there is an ur gency for directly supervised reintroduction secondary to nutritional concern. c) Introduction of a common essential nutrient/food in a noninfant with widespread avoidance and there is an urgency for directly supervised rein- troduction, such as a G-tube efed child where a change from an elemental to other nutrient-based food is necessary due to nutritional concern. d) Critical concern that peanut has been withheld unnecessarily in a high-risk infant for the purposes of early introduction, and supervised introdu ction is needed because of previously identi ed peanut sensitization. e) Drug allergy patient where there is an urgent or critical need for drug allergy delabeling, challenge, or desensitization. f) Vaccine challenge in any immunocompromised individual. g) This would imply that, until pandemic response measures are removed, the following challenges are considered elective and be deferred (or in some instances considered for telehealth): /C15All baked milk or egg challenges. /C15Elective early allergen introduction in any non ehigh-risk infant (consider telehealth). /C15Introduction of peanut, tree nut, or seed where the child is sensitized to 1 or more of these items, but has not ever ingested these previously, and testing was motivated by known/suspected allergy to another tree nut or seed and the item was previously withheld or not introduced. This infers that any challenges to con rm tolerance for cross-reactivity will be deferred in the interim. /C15Reintroduction of noncritical nutrients in children tested for food allergy secondary to eczema, where the food has been avoided for more than 2 y, starting in infancy (consider telehealth). /C15Reintroduction of foods being avoided for EoE (consider telehealth). /C15Routine reintroduction to establish tolerance for outgrown IgE-mediated food allergy or FPIES. /C15Evaluation of children referred with food sensitization drawn as a panel and/or in the absence of a speci c history suggesting symptomatic ingestion, including testing done for the evaluation of atopic dermatitis (consider telehealth). /C15Nonemergent drug challenges for the purposes of delabeling where there is no immediate plan for administration in the next 30 d. /C15Vaccine challenges in any immunocompetent individual. 2) We recommend suspending the routine advice on allergy action plans to seek emergency care/call 911 after epinephrine use, unless symptoms do not immediately resolve without recurrence after a single dose of epinephrine. 51 3) The following should be strongly considered with regard to routine allergy visits: a) Postpone any return visits where the patient has been seen within the previous 12-18 mo and there has been no interim history of reaction or suspicion of new food allergy (consider telehealth). b) Postpone any new patient visit not involving suspected IgE-mediated allergy to the common 8 foods plus seed or FPIES or any EoE visits for the purposes of dietary elimination testing (could defer to GI guidance about the need for new or routine endoscopic evaluation of possible EoE, butsuggest that this be postponed; consider telehealth). c) Postpone any face-to-face new or return patient visit for suspected allergic proctocolitis (consider telehealth). d) Postpone any new or return drug/vaccine reaction visits or evaluations where re-administration is not anticipated in the next 6 mo (consider telehealth). e) Postpone any second opinion or transfer of care where the patient has or has had another allergist, or visits from out-of-region patients (consider telehealth). f) Postpone ritized to telehealth or face-to-face evaluation. 4) Defer initiation and updosing of any food immunotherapy treatment. All patients should be held at their current dose until normal services resume. 5) Defer new and follow-up evaluations for food allergy, anaphylaxis, or EoE study visits, and discontinue all interim research visits (consider tel ehealth).

Service adjustment for allergic skin disorders The following hierarchy of service adjustments could be considered: 1) New patient visits for particularly severe cases of suspected angioedema, in particular events with pharyngeal/laryngeal, abdominal, or genita l involvement, can be prioritized for face-to-face visits or telehealth. Such patients may need laboratory workup for hereditary angioedema. Much of the visit could be conducted via virtual care, with orders placed for phlebotomy as appropriate (if available). 2) For patients with established hereditary angioedema under good control without any remarkable episodes in the past 6 mo, it would be in their best health care interest to be managed by virtual care. 3) Visits for new onset of lesser severity of angioedema can be postponed (consider telehealth).4) Visits for new evaluation of chronic urticaria can be postponed, with referring physicians given instructions to start the patient on every-day-t wice-a-day according to best evidence, pending resolution of the COVID- 19 pandemic. 52Evidence suggests that laboratory testing can be postponed or deferred in most patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.53,54Patients with refractory urticaria could be considered for telehealth or a face-to-face visit to recommend further evaluation and management, including ini tiation of omalizumab in properly selected patients.55 5) Face-to-face visits for ongoing evaluation of established chronic urticaria can be deferred, in particular if this condition has been well contro lled in the past 6 mo, and issues or medication adjustments can be handled through phone triage or telehealth. 6) For new evaluation of atopic dermatitis, severity of the illness as assessed by the referring physician should be strongly considered. Visits for m ild atopic dermatitis evaluation may be deferred and the patient managed with topical corticosteroids under the direction of the referring provider. A recommendation to escalate potency within a certain range of topical corticosteroids can be provided. For moderate atopic dermatitis, consider tel e- health evaluation. For severe disease, in particular in an infant or in a patient with extensive body surface area involvement and a history of super-infection, face-to-face visits may be necessary and should receive priority over any other patient with atopic dermatitis. For return patient visit s for atopic dermatitis, the same general principles apply, with extended consideration for the use of telehealth in the more severe patients who have demonstrated improvement in lieu of face-to-face visits. 7) In the context of atopic dermatitis without a history of acute food reaction, food allergy screening should be deferred. No skin or serologic allerg y testing evaluation without a discernable, probable food trigger is advised, given this is low yield and represents a poor prioritization of services . 56-60 8) Initiation of biologic therapy for atopic dermatitis should be weighed very carefully but remains a viable option because this is administered at h ome and requires limited face-to-face supervision. This can be managed via visiting nurse services or via phone triage. TABLE V. Service adjustment for immunodeficiency The following hierarchy of service adjustments could be considered: 1) Patients with a known exposure, as well as acutely ill patients with primary immunode ciency with or without a history of a known exposure, must be investigated for SARS-Cov-2. It is particularly important for patients known to have T-cell immunode ciency, athymia, or SCID to seek medical care immediately on presentation of symptoms (fever, cough). 2) Monitoring for infections other than SARS-CoV-2 is required. Immunode ciency patients may have a myriad of infections other than SARS-CoV-2 (such as liver abscesses, osteomyelitis, meningitis, bacteremia, and PJP, and all of these would require face-to-face evaluation if suspected). Pa tients with bronchiectasis in particular may need close monitoring, given infectious issues at baseline related to this that may place such individuals at r isk. Patients with central lines and/or neutropenia will still require blood cultures and antibiotics if they become ill (depending on their clinical sce nario). 3) New cases of suspected SCID or other T-cell de ciencies should continue to be seen and assessed as would occur under normal service operations. Such patients should be brought back to a clean room immediately on arrival to the clinic/of ce. It may be reasonable to initially evaluate consultations for abnormalities on newborn screening by telehealth. 4) Radiographic service access may be needed to help distinguish between COVID-19 and what could be a lobar or otherwise complicated pneumonia (bacterial). 5) If a patient has not already transitioned immunoglobulin replacement therapy to home services (IV/SC), they will still need to come into their infu sion centers. Plans must be made to ensure that home immunoglobulin replacement services continue, because this is an urgent therapy. It is unlikely that any current immunoglobulin supply has SARS-CoV-2 antibody protection or is contaminated with the virus. Given that this is a donor-dependent therapy, this could affect future supplies. Patient may wish to consider transitioning to home immunoglobulin replacement (IV/SC). 6) Autoimmune phenomena must be tended to promptly. Concern for autoimmune cytopenias or enteropathy need prompt evaluation, treatment, and monitoring. 7) For those patients receiving various immunosuppressive agents that require therapeutic drug-level monitoring, phlebotomy services must be acc essible to monitor for toxicities. This is critical for autoimmune and transplant (BMT/solid-organ) patients. 8) Patients who are also being treated for malignancy should continue receiving chemotherapy.9) Telehealth should be considered for routine/annual follow-up, and in many cases it may be reasonable to defer routine monitoring labs, imaging, an d PFTs for several months. 10) Telehealth may be considered for acute visits for possible infections that are low acuity (ie, otitis media, sinusitis, and super cial skin infections). 11) Telehealth may be considered for initial consultations of patients referred for possible immunode ciency; however, in some circumstances, face-to- face evaluations and access to ancillary laboratory services may be needed. 12) Clinicians should review routine self-care examination measures with patients, such as palpation of lymph nodes, joints, and cavities that in so me conditions may be prone to abscess development, and recommend to patients a frequency with which these should be performed.

Practice implications With the declaration of reduction of nonessential medical ser- vices, physicians in private small or solo practices may have signi - cant concerns about practice sustainability in times of uncertainty.Please see this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org for practice implications of COVID-19 reduction in services. CONCLUSIONS The new decade has begun with unprecedented challenges. Although we each hope the COVID-19 pandemic will be con- tained and mitigated as soon as possible, we all have personalroles and professional duties to our patients and our larger so-ciety. A pandemic response during a global emergency is a highly unusual and atypical circumstance from business as usual. The framework described herein represents a course of action in ahighly speci c and temporary situation, necessary only in a most extreme and improbable circumstance, where there is a state of emergency and a pandemic risk that outweighs the riskof deferral of an of ce visit for conditions within the spectrum of allergic/immunologic disorders. Please keep in mind that these are suggestions that must be conditioned on individual \"on the ground \"circumstances. They are not mandates or forced actions. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician andindividual health system. These suggestions are intended to helpprovide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients during the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged. Impor-tantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. The expert panel acknowledges that taking actions to limit face-to-face access may have nancial implications in terms of lost revenue, xed operating costs, and unclear reimbursement for telehealth and that advocacy on the part of professional organizations may be both appropriate andnecessary to leverage some share of federal resources during thispandemic. 8However, the broader nancial implications and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are beyond the scope of this document. Although SARS-CoV-2 presents the allergy/immunology community with a challenge on an unprecedented scale, it is not therst coronavirus we have encountered in the last few de- cades.68,69It is likely that this will not be the last pandemic we encounter, and strategies that may be proven effective for COVID-19 may inform our future approach in unexpected di-sasters that we hope will never come to pass. Still, as we meet this challenge with compassion, humility, and common sense, it will again be evident that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound ofcure\u2014in our clinic, community, nation, and world. If nothing else, we can fall back on the old adage \"remember your training. \" We are some of the most highly trained and adept medical specialists in the world. We can and will persevere through anychallenge that the specialty faces. REFERENCES 1. Del Rio C, Malani PN.

Accessed March 15, MONTH 202012 SHAKER ET ALONLINE REPOSITORY BIOLOGY, EPIDEMIOLOGY, CLINICAL PRESENTATION, AND MANAGEMENT The biology of SARS-CoV-2 is of interest as it uses densely glycosylated spike (S) protein to enter host cells and bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (expressed in type IIalveolar cells), similar to the 2003 coronavirus that caused severeacute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). Preliminary data sug- gest that the coronavirus may have originated in bats and un- dergone recombination in the pangolin (a scaly anteater), anendangered and commonly traf cked mammal. E1But in contrast to the 2003 epidemic SARS, which spread to more than 2 dozen countries before it was contained, global spread has been moredramatic with SARS-Cov-2. Between November 2002 and July 2003, a total of 8090 probable SARS cases were reported to the World Health Organization, with only 8 US cases having labo-ratory evidence of SARS-CoV. E1,E2Similarly, although the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus rst reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 was associated with a high mortality rate,only 2 cases in the United States ever tested positive. E3However, SARS-CoV-2 has proven more infectious and elusive than its cousins SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, with 2952 COVID-19 cases and 57 deaths occur-ring in the United States alone, as of March 15, 2020. In Canada, there were 250 con rmed cases and 1 death as of March 15, 2020. E3As of this date there have been 156,400 con rmed COVID-19 cases with 5833 deaths worldwide, though variations in testing availability may suggest this is a potential underesti- mation of the true caseload. On a positive note, however, thereare currently 73,968 total recovered cases reported worldwide asof March 15, 2020. E4These numbers are expected to rise. Although the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was initially reported at 1 to 14 days, with a median of 5 to 6 days, it may beas long as 24 days. E1,E5The virus is spread by large droplets, but also possibly stool and blood.E1Of note, health care transmission is high, with one study indicating 41% of 138 cases to be pre-sumptively health care acquired. E6Clinical presentation involves fever (77%-98% of patients), dry cough (46%-82% of patients), shortness of breath (3%-31%), and fatigue or myalgia (11%-52%). Symptoms may also include headache, sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. E1,E3Laboratory features include lymphopenia (70%) and eosinopenia (52.9%), and imagingoften and ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography. E1,E6 Certain upper respiratory tract symptoms overlap with allergicrhinitis and in fluenza in the early stages that only later progress to more clearly de ned COVID-19 symptoms, a point that the prac- ticing allergist/immunologist should keep in mind . The overall case-fatality rate (CFR) has been estimated at around 2.3% of patients with COVID-19 presenting for medical evaluation, but it is highly variable and may be as high as 8% to 15% in higher risk populations. E1,E7For example, in a recent report of 72,314 COVID-19 cases in China, no deaths occurredin children younger than age 9 years, but the CFR for patients 70 to 79 years was 8.0%. The age-adjusted CFR was highest in patients 80 years and older (14.8%). In patients with criticalillnesses, the CFR was 49.0%. Preexisting conditions also in- crease risk, with a CFR of 10.5% for cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0% forhypertension, and 5.6% for cancer. E7Data from Korea are similar.E8Health care workers are not immune, as 3.8% of cases occurred in health care workers. However, of 1716 COVID-19 infections in health care workers, though 14.8% were classi ed as severe, only 5 deaths were reported (CFR, 0.3%). There is some speculation that insuf cient access to testing and intensive care services (secondary to equipment and space shortages) maycontribute to some of the fatality rate variation. Again, it should be emphasized that data reporting and event rates are very fluid and rapidly changing. Of note, fatality rates may actually be much lower when mild and asymptomatic cases are considered. There have been limitations to timely and accurate testing for COVID-19 at the onset of this pandemic. It is important to notethat as access to accurate and timely testing becomes more widelyavailable, a larger number of patients will be identi ed, including those with mild and asymptomatic disease, thereby potentially causing the calculated CFR to fall. Before and initially after thedeclaration of a pandemic, barriers included recommendations by the World Health Organization and national and regional public health agencies to limit testing based on a combination oftravel and exposure history together with symptoms, though these recommendations have markedly evolved to become suf- ciently inclusive as the pandemic spread has become more rapid. In addition, current testing requires a laborious and time-consuming process available only in specialized laboratories, us- ing multiple steps and with limitations that inherently slow the process and increase the risk for errors. Access to rapidlydeployed eld test kits available at the point-of-care, currently in development, will signi cantly improve public health efforts to contain the virus and limit its spread. Management of COVID-19 is currently limited primarily to supportive care. Antiviral agents with effectiveness against SARS- CoV-2 are not yet known, though the nucleoside prodrugremdesivir is under investigation, in addition to other agents including lopinavir, ritonavir, and favilavir, and both chloroquine \u2014EXPANDING SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC Telehealth can be central in delivering allergy services within a risk-strati ed context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The ability to integrate telecommunications, information systems, and pa- tient care has been in place for more than 4 decades and has beengaining traction across medical specialties, even before theemergence of COVID-19. E9,E10Both the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (ACAAI) have beenstrong advocates to advance telehealth to allow allergy/immu- nology services to expand and most directly serve patients where they are needed. E9,E11An excellent example of telehealth in practice is its use in penicillin allergy delabeling.E12,E13Tele- health services have also been shown to be a viable alternative option to face-to-face visits for the management of patients withvarious conditions in the spectrum of allergic/immunologic dis-orders, including asthma. E14 Providers who wish to limit their exposure to infected patients may choose to see patients from their home. To do this, patientswould go to the allergist 'so fce where they could be seen by the allergist using facilitated telehealth. This type of facilitated visit should be done using 2-way video using a Health InsuranceJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME -, 12.e1Portability and Accountability Act ecompliant platform.E15To perform a physical examination, which is required only for an initial visit, digital examination equipment including a stetho- scope and high-resolution camera with an otoscope adaptorwould be required. E16Established patients do not require a physical examination unless medically necessary, so if the practice were limited to such patients, it is not necessary to acquire digitalexamination equipment. With appropriate training, a nurse in the allergist 'so fce could serve as the tele-facilitator. If other providers are present in the of ce during the visit, procedures such as skin testing could be performed. This type of visit limits the provider 's exposure to infectious diseases; however, it does not reduce the patient 's exposure. To reduce patient exposure, established patients could be seen from their home. E17This can be done if the visit is performed either with a 2-way video connection or by telephone. Since 2018, Medicare has paid for virtual visits with patients who havean established relationship with a physician provided that the communication is (1) not related to a medical visit within the previous 7 days and (2) does not lead to a medical visit within thenext 24 hours. E18One requirement is that the patient must verbally consent to virtual check-ins in advance, and the consent must be documented in the medical record prior to the patientusing the service. Billing for these virtual check-ins is speci ct o the technology used such as telephone (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code G2012 or Current Procedural Terminology codes 99441-99433) or by video (HealthcareCommon Procedure Coding System code G2010). Another option is to charge patients a flat fee for service (typically $49.95 for general services and $79.95 for specialty services) to usedirect-to-consumer telehealth from their home. This avoids the need to meet requirements set out in the Current Procedural Terminology codes but is not reimbursable by health plans. Medicare also pays for patients to communicate with their doctors without going to the doctor 'so fce using online patient portals. These types of individual communications, like the vir-tual check-ins, must be initiated by the patient; however, prac-titioners may educate bene ciaries on the availability of this kind of service before patient initiation. The communications can occur over a 7-day period. The services may be billed usingCurrent Procedural Terminology codes 99421-99423 and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes G2061- G206, as applicable. One advantage of setting up a telehealth service during COVID-19 is that it can establish the infrastructure for an ongoing telehealth service after the current situation is over.Telehealth has been shown to be effective for managing patients with chronic conditions, E19and it is as effective for managing asthma as in-person visits.E14Although there is nothing good about a pandemic with COVID-19, it can be seen as an op-portunity to introduce telehealth into an allergy practice. In the setting of a US national emergency, US Congressional and Executive Branch actions are expected to expand telehealthservices provided by health care providers during the emergen- cy. E20Speci cally it is expected that the US Department of Health and Human Services will waive or modify telehealthMedicare requirements, which in practice could greatly expand telehealth services by allowing practice across state lines via relaxing the originating site requirement. Additional expansionsare planned to allow provision of a follow-up visit by phone withaudiovisual interaction, such as through an iPhone or androidplatform. This expanded telehealth coding may be limited to established patients and still require necessary documentation to support the evaluation and management code along with a tel- ehealth place of service code, and a potential modi er if required by a commercial payer. E20,E21Speci c details of expected changes are evolving. SHARED DECISION MAKING Shared decision making (SDM) is a preferred alternative to physician-informed, physician-directed paternalistic decisionmaking. This is a valued approach where there are preference- sensitive care options, de ned as conditions with multiple treatment options having signi cant trade-offs and varying po- tential outcomes, with decisions re flective of personal values and preferences. E22 The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic creates unique challenges to SDM, because societal interests may play a largerrole in the doctor-patient interaction than in a nonpandemic setting. Infection control becomes critical to patients and clini- cians alike, but face-to-face visits will have larger implicationsbeyond the clinic that may not be appreciated in the moment. However, SDM can direct decision making and choices to seek face-to-face versus telehealth encounters, particularly beforeescalation to a \"red zone \"threat level ( Figure 2 ). However, even in a\"red zone \"threat level, SDM will likely continue to play a role, although this will be signi cantly limited \u2014for example, in decisions whether or not to postpone a course of aeroallergenimmunotherapy or simply mark the course completed after 3 years of therapy. However, it must be acknowledged that in the setting of a pandemic national emergency, when faced with re-strictions on ambulatory services, the clinician and patient will each have more limited access to resources that would be more available in nonemergent settings, and some decisions will bemade on their behalf. What may be more challenging than limiting health care access in nonurgent situations is directing a patient with conditional health risk that exceeds the risk ofcontracting COVID-19 to break social distancing and seek face-to-face care. Here, the clinician must take the time to clearly explain the facts and the options, along with their potential outcomes. COMMUNICATION WITH PATIENTS The current COVID-19 pandemic has served to illuminate the best and worst impacts of living in our digital age. Infor- mation regarding this pandemic is being updated continuously across all platforms, including misinformation, incomplete in-formation taken out of context, pseudoscienti c promises of miracle \"cures, \"and proliferation of anecdotal reports. During such times, patients need sources of information that they cantrust. Allergists/immunologists should respond to this need byextending the long-standing trust developed through years of face-to-face encounters to online resources. There are 3 main areas where allergists/immunologists should provide information and communication with their patients online: general updates, of ce-speci c changes to normal prac- tice, and social media. Allergists/immunologists should discussthe need to rapidly update their existing Web site and social media channels with the personnel involved in day-to-day op- erations of these resources. Discussion topics should includecurrent capabilities for updating information, decisions regardingJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT MONTH 202012.e2 SHAKER ET ALthe creation of new content and curation of existing content, and strategy regarding topics to address. Mailing letters to patients may be the preferred method of communication for some, but this does not allow for dissemination of rapidly changing updatesand critical information. Allergists/immunologists should post information on their Web site and social media channels regarding frequently askedquestions surrounding COVID-19 (see Table E2 for an example template to consider). It is imperative that this messaging echoes the recommendations of vetted public health authorities such asthe CDC or the World Health Organization. Patients will need to understand infection transmission (including incubation period for exposure and acute illness), symptoms, risk for speci c populations, and why public health measures such as socialdistancing are important. Practices can either link to readily available resources on the CDC Web site or create their own content through infographics, blog posts, or new content ontheir Web site. Allergists/immunologists have a responsibility to offer evidence-based information and, where evidence is lacking, usevetted resources to support opinions or discuss areas lacking in current understanding. However, it is of the utmost importance for each clinician to remember our clinical \"lane\"with respect to what we do and do not care for, so that we limit potentialmisinformation or information that may con flict with that of another clinician who is more responsible for particular care for that individual. In addition to posting general information regarding COVID- 19, allergists/immunologists should use online resources to pro- vide information surrounding any changes to their practicesetting. If done properly, this can serve as a portal for sharing timely information to large numbers of patients and reduce burden on practice resources, such as telephone calls. Informa-tion should be regularly updated and include current restrictions in regard to screening questions and emphasize that all patients should call before arrival if they have had travel to any countriescurrently listed as high risk or contact with someone who hasknown or suspected COVID-19 infection in the last 14 days, as well as fever (temperature, >100.4 /C14F) and/or acute cough. As discussed, patients with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma who haveacute symptoms may overlap signi cantly with those who have COVID-19. As such, allergists/immunologists should consider posting information on their Web site or social media channelsregarding important differences between these conditions, as well as indications for COVID-19 testing. In addition, as new pro- tocols are implemented regarding telehealth visits, changes toimmunotherapy appointments or schedules, or contact pre- cautions, this information should be updated as rapidly as possible online. Finally, allergists/immunologists need to understand the in- fluence that social media has on medical decision making. E23 Even if medical professionals are not actively using social me- dia, they need to identify key areas of misinformation to developanticipatory guidance during individual encounters and when posting online. Current examples include misinformation sur- rounding the risk of inhaled corticosteroids in patients withasthma, risk of infection/severe exacerbation among individuals with asthma, and promotion of non eevidence-based remedies or preventative treatments such as homeopathy, supplements,vitamins, and alternative/complementary medicine. Allergists/ immunologists who already use social media as medical pro- fessionals should adopt a similar approach as outlined above regarding dissemination of best practice guidelines and publichealth measures. Speci c issues pertaining to patient privacy, social media policies, and personal accounts need to be reviewed with ALL staff working in medical of ces. It is imperative that no member of any medical practice post information to their per- sonal social media accounts regarding the use of isolation/per- sonal protective equipment in the of ce, patients who were tested or positive for COVID-19, or any members of the staff tested or positive for COVID-19. Such posts have high potential to induce panic among patients and their family members whomay have visited the of ce recently or been in contact with those individuals. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Practice implications of COVID-19 reduction in services include (1) imposed or voluntary 14-day physician and/or staffquarantine, (2) practice restrictions after actual physician COVID-19 infection, (3) nancial reduction due to decline in consultation and follow-up assessments, immunotherapy visits,and reduction in diagnostic testing, and (4) resulting staff lay-offsor termination. These concerns are very real and valid and, un- derstandably, there are no easy solutions to these problems. It is critical that staff stay at home when ill. In the event of isolation, whether precautionary or after exposure or after infection, all attempts should be made to ensure that ongoing patient care coverage be arranged with other clinicians. In manysituations, telehealth solutions can be provided during times of quarantine. It is the hope that virtual care services will provide some compensation for medical assessments, although this may vary depending on jurisdiction and may be less than typical clinical services provided by the allergist. If reduction of clinical assess-ments and diagnostic testing is implemented, then clinics will seea signi cant reduction in revenue. This reduction in income may have effects on immediate nancial needs and long-term nancial planning and may signi cantly impact those who are close to retirement or just starting practice. Dif cult discussions with staff who perform these assessments and diagnostic procedures may need to occur, and lay-offs may be necessary due to scal limi- tations. Early and clear communication is essential to ensure that all staff are aware of future practice implications and potential ofce closures and/or lay-offs. Some of ce insurance policies provide overhead expense coverage for scenarios that may take effect during medically necessitated quarantine or pandemic outbreaks. Allergists/immunologists will continue to place social re- sponsibility and professionalism ahead of personal nancial ex- pectations when making decisions about clinic closures, diagnostic reductions, and personal quarantine. At the end of theday, physicians and other health care providers must follow federal, state/provincial, and municipal regulations and imposed directions to avoid penalty/recourse. We recognize the signi cant implications this viral pandemic has on both physicians and clinic staff and hope that many of these practice modi cations are short-term.J ALLERGY Personal protective measures against pandemic infectionE2 /C15Hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 s /C15Use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available /C15Use tissues to cover coughs and sneezes, then discard in the trash, and cough/sneeze into the crook of your elbow /C15CleanbibE/disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces /C15If you are sick, stay home /C15Consider social distancing (the CDC de nes this as remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance [ w6f to r 2 m] from others when possible) and reduction of nonhousehold contacts to a minimum (eg, no hand shaking, kissing, or other cordial contact) TABLE E2. COVID-19 frequently asked questions What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is a new form of coronavirus rst identi ed in December 2019. Coronaviruses in general are not new and are a common cause of colds and upper respiratory tract infections. We don 't yet know why this new form, COVID-19, is more severe. How is COVID-19 spread? COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly person-to-person through respiratory droplets in coughs or sneezes. It can live on surfaces as well through thes e droplets. What is the time period when COVID-19 can spread? Unfortunately, people can spread infection to others before symptoms rst appear. It can then be spread for up to 14 days after symptom onset (possibly longer). What are the symptoms of COVID-19? Most people experience mild illness, but severe illness and death can occur. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms. How is COVID-19 treated? There are no current vaccines or antiviral treatments to use when someone is acutely infected. Treatment relies on supportive care to treat symptoms when they occur. When should I seek emergency care? Seek immediate medical attention if you have dif culty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, or inability to stay awake. These are not the only reasons someone may need emergency care \u2014call your doctor for other concerns. Call any emergency department or medical provider BEFORE arrival to allow them to put precautions in place. Can I get tested for COVID-19 at your of ce? The indications for testing as well as availability for testing are constantly changing. Please refer to our Web site for current information or call o ur ofce with any questions. When should I cancel my regularly scheduled allergy appointment? Some nonurgent visits will likely be cancelled for you. If your visit has not been canceled, please call to discuss any speci c concerns before arrival, especially if you have had recent travel to high-risk countries or contact with anyone with known/suspected COVID-19. Also call before arrival if you have had fever/cough in the past 2 wk. Is it safe to come to your of ce? Ofces are taking all recommended precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including reassessing what care must be done in a face-to-face manner, screening all patients and accompanying family members, regularly disinfecting examination rooms and public areas, and staying up to date with current recommendations from the local Department of Public Health. I'm getting allergy shots \u2014What should I do? Please call or refer to the practice Web site for up-to-date information. Practices may need to change the way allergy shots are administered and will notify patients as soon as possible of any changes. Unless you hear differently, please continue your current schedule. However, for some patients, this may be held for the time being, and doses missed. Will your of ce be closing? Ofces may need to adjust the number of appointments or types of visits depending on future spread of COVID-19. Please refer to the practice Web site for the most up-to-date information. What if I have asthma? How will COVID-19 affect me? We do not have a lot of information regarding risk of asthma exacerbation with COVID-19. For now, we recommend continuing all currently prescribed daily asthma medications, contacting your health care provider if you have had frequent symptoms or have needed your rescue inhaler more often,and starting your asthma treatment plan as soon as possible if symptoms occur. Are steroids harmful if someone has COVID-19? It does not appear that inhaled steroids or short courses of oral steroids are harmful for the treatment of asthma. Risks of stopping regular use of inha led steroids include a loss of asthma control and possible need for treatment with oral steroids. Please do not stop any medications without discussing wi th your doctor. Ihave an immune de ciency \u2014What precautions should I take?
