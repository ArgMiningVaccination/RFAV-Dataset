Experiencing the Effects of Chiropractic Before joining the practice team, Crystal hadn't had chiropractic care before. \"It wasn't something that I knew was meant to be preventative or vital.\" Now that she gets adjusted regularly, she appreciates the many benefits of this form of natural health care. \"For me, what I find most interesting is that it has a huge impact on your ability to manage your emotions. I think many people tend to focus on chiropractic as a solution to physical issues or physical pains. \"But what I'm finding, especially now that I'm in care, is that something with your emotions happens. You start to better understand who you are, what you're feeling, and navigate that much more responsibly.\" Appreciating the Positive Influence of the Practice For Crystal, ending up at [Intrinsic Care Chiropractic](/our-approachs/) was unexpected and profoundly life-changing. \"I don't know if it's having a supportive staff where you don't feel like you're drowning; I don't know if it's the emphasis on taking care of yourself; and I don't know if it's the actual chiropractic care; but there's something about all of it combined that just makes me want to be better.\" Adopting a Wellness Lifestyle Since she's become part of our wellness-focused practice, Crystal has incorporated healthy habits into her daily life. That includes working out, cooking healthy meals, and being mindful of what's in her food. Other activities Crystal enjoys outside the practice are playing with her cats and reading books.
