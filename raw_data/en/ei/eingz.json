Naturopathic Medicine is a distinct healthcare profession that combines the wisdom of nature with the rigors of modern science[i]. Naturopathic Doctors are trained as primary care providers who diagnose, treat and manage patients of all ages with acute and chronic conditions. The focus is on prevention and optimizing health by addressing the underlying cause of symptoms and concentrating on whole-patient wellness. Naturopathic Medicine Education Naturopathic Doctors are trained at four-year accredited, residential, naturopathic medical schools. The first two years focus on a basic science curriculum similar to conventional medical schools, while the last two years are spent learning clinical sciences. Students rotate through clinical training on both general medicine and specialized medicine shifts, under the supervision of a licensed medical provider. In addition to pharmacology and standards of care, students learn about evidence-based natural therapies such as nutrition, lifestyle-based medicine, mind/body therapies, botanical medicine, and more.

After graduating with a doctor degree in Naturopathic Medicine, a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) must pass comprehensive naturopathic physician licensing exams (NPLEX) and satisfy requirements for licensure in their state. Naturopathic Medicine is a small profession, and not all states have established the appropriate regulation and licensure bodies. Nevada is one of the states that does not yet have a licensing board for NDs. It is essential in pre-licensed states, such as Nevada, to always ensure practitioners referring to themselves as \"naturopaths\" completed the appropriate rigorous medical training at an accredited institution and passed the NPLEX postdoctoral board exam. In addition to being a Family Nurse Practitioner, Dr. Bachman is a 2013 graduate of Bastyr University's Naturopathic Doctor (ND) degree program, an accredited institution. She passed the postdoctoral board examination (NPLEX) following graduation and is licensed as a Naturopathic Doctor in California. Nevada does not yet have a licensing board for Naturopathic Doctors.
