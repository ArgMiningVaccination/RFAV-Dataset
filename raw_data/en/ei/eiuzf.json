This pilgrimage is a unique combination of purpose-driven adventure, trekking, and pilgrimage to living sacred shrines of the Himalayan Tradition. Our journey will be enriched by practice, satsang, and the company of like-minded fellow spiritual seekers. It will be led by Ishan Tigunait, whose many years of practice and pilgrimage under the guidance of Swami Rama and Pandit Rajmani Tigunait have given him valuable insight into the roots of the Himalayan Tradition. Retrace the footsteps of the sages, such as Swami Rama, Bengali Baba, and many other masters, as we travel to renowned Himalayan shrines, such as Tungnath, Triyuginarayan, Ukhimath, Kalimath, and Anasuya Devi. Deepen your connection to the Himalayan Tradition and enrich your spiritual practice by experiencing the hidden essence of these living shrines. Unlike many modern pilgrimages, we'll spend significant time in this sacred space as we trek daily from shrine to shrine, giving you the opportunity to absorb the living energy that pervades this entire region.
