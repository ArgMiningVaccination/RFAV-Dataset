The number o f applications received has grown every year, thus increasing the competition for awards and making the criteria and point system even more important. A ll the articles paid for and published so far have been placed in the KU ScholarWorks institutional repository under \"Open Access .\" Included in this report are the statistics for FY 2018 in the following tables: Table 1. Numbers of applications and awards Table 2. Total amount spent and a break down by campus We've also included appendices covering the fund from Inception (Oct. 2012) through June 2018 : Appendix A A Short History of the First Six Years of the Open Access Author Fund Appendix B Cumulative Statistics Appendix C Highlights of Article -Level Metrics for Selected Papers Funded by the OAAF Appendix D Full List of Published Papers Funded by the OAAF Appendix E Applications Received by Unit 2 KU Open Access Author Fund Annual Report, FY 17 Table 1. Statistics for FY 2018 When compared to the figures from the previous fiscal year (July 2016 -June 2017 ), there was an increase in the number of applications received, and a similar number of applications that were rejected. The number of awards that were offered and paid were also close , but there is reason to believe that the number of awards paid will increase over the next few months' as there are currently six unexpired awards. 2017 -18 2016 -17 1. Applications Received 63 56 2. Applications Rejected * 31 28 3. Awards Offered 32 29 4. Awards Paid ** 18 15 Note: Six of the authors who were offered awards in FY 18 haven't used them as of 8 -28-18, so the number of \"Awards Paid\" might still go up. The n umbers in Lines 2 and 3 above add up to the total number of applications received (Line 1). Line 4 is a sub -set of Line 3. * Main r easons why applications were r ejected 1. Other applications received higher point totals and there wasn't enough money to fund all eligible applicants during that month's competition. (By far the most common reason.) 2. The author or department / program had already paid the article processing charges. (According to the OAAF guidelines, we cannot provide reimbursements.) 3. The au thor, journal, or publisher did not meet the OAAF criteria. 4. The application was a duplicate or two different people applied using the same article. 5. The applicant had already received an OAAF award in the previous 12 months. ** Main r easons why awards were not u sed 1. The manuscript was rejected by the editor / editorial board of the journal. 2. The publisher required payment before the OAAF review team would make its next round of decisions . (The team meets during the first week of one month to mak e decisions on all applications received during the previous month.) 3. The article was published w ithout charge or at a lower fee, which the author was able to cover with grant funds or other available money. 4. The author did not use the award before it expi red (4 months from the award notification date). 3 Table 2. Financial Statistics for FY 2018 Amount allocated for FY 18 $25,000 Awards not redeemed in FY17 $3,321 Total amount available in FY1 8 $28,321 As of the end of FY 18 , we had $ 5323 remaining in the fund , which was rolled over to FY 19 . As of November 13, 2018 , there is $ 1,250 in rese rve for awards made during FY 18 for articles still in the submission process. The portion of those funds not used before the four -month expiration dat e will be retur ned to the OAAF for use in FY 19 . Awards by C ampus (as of November 13, 2018) KU Medical Center (All Locations) $11,145 51.2% KU Lawrence / Edwards $10,603 48.8% Total Expenditures $21,748 Note: Total does not include $1,250 for awards offered but not used. Dollar amounts have been rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Percentages have been rounded to equal 100% Amount Paid per Award Highest $1,575 Lowest $200 Average / Mean $1,035 Median $1,200 What Publishers Charge Authors The amount of money publishers charged authors applying for awards this year ranged from a high of $3,92 0 to a low of $20 0. Twenty -eight of the sixty-three charges were over our $1500 maximum award amount. Highest $3,920 Lowest $200 Average / Mean $1,653 Median $1,495 4 Appendix A A Short History of the Open Access Author Fund at KU The One University Open Access Author Fund (OAAF) at the University of Kansas is administered by the OAAF Review Team composed of library staff at the KU campus in Lawrence and at the KU Medica l Center's Dykes Library in Kansas City. Oversight is provided by the sponsors who support the fund - KU's Provost, KU's Vice Chancellor for Research, and the KU Medical Center's Vice Chancellor for Research. Detail ed criteria and eligibility standards, an online application form, a list of awards made, and additional information is available at this URL: http://library.kumc.edu/authors -fund.xml . The OAAF began its first two -year pilot program in October of 2012 with $50,000 allocated equally by the Lawrence campus and the Medical Center. During that first pilot, which closed at the end of June 2014, applications were reviewed on a first -come, first -served basis . This resulted in the entire years' worth of funds being dispersed within four to six months of the opening of the fund. To ensure that money would be available for an entire fiscal year during the second pilot phase (2014 -2016), the OAAF Review Team sol icited the advice of the members of the Faculty Consultation Group. Additional criteria, new eligibility standards, and different review periods were developed. In the redesigned competitive process, all the applications received during one month are now reviewed within the first seven business days of the next month. Various levels of weighted priority are now assigned as follows: A. Author 's status (graduate student, pre -tenured faculty, early career research staff, etc.) B. Author's access to grants or other funding C. Author's record of previous OA awards received This second phase of the pilot began in November 2014 with a new allocation of $50,000 to cover 2014 -2016. Awards were made using the new criteria and procedures. The fund has subsequently received $50,000 in July 2016 and July 2018. The fund will continue to distribute awards through June 20 20. The number of fund applications has ranged between two and nine each month, out of which an average of one to three are ap proved. All of the articles that are paid for (at least in part) by the OAAF are now available for viewing at the OOAF website here - http://library.kumc.edu/oa - fund -awards.xml . The same articles a re also added to the KU ScholarWorks Open Access community at: https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/11673 . The OAAF is marketed to faculty and graduate students through our website, soci al media, email, and group presentations. Future Plans The O AAF provides important assistance to help KU's faculty/researchers and students publish in reputable journals that allow for open sharing. One possible action we might take is to conduct an envir onment scan of other universities' OA fund policies and procedures. We would also like to evaluate article metrics to determine the impact of our OA funded articles from the inception of the fund through the end of the sixth year of trials. 5 Appendix B Cumulative Statistics Totals, Inception - June 201 8 The following tables document the outcomes of the OAAF applications and awards process from the inception of the fund ( Oct. 2012 ) through the end of the sixth year ( June 2018 ). For a short history of the fund , see Appendix A above . Table 1. Totals Applications Received 292 Applications Denied 120 Awards Offered 172 Awards Paid 112 Note: Six more autho rs received awards, but have n't used them yet, so \"Awards Paid\" might go up.
