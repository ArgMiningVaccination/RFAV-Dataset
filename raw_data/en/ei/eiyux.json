The sector is well -established , having evolved over the last 30 years to become a world -class industry that supports research, employment and high -skilled manufacturing. High demand for complementary medicine products is driving steady growth, with the industry reaching $4.9 billion in revenues in 2017. Over the last five years, t he sector has achieved $2 billion in growth , predominantly as a result of our strong exports. Over 60 per cent of companies in our sector are engaged in exporting activities, and numerous Australian brands are recognised and trusted internationally. The Australian government has committed to fostering a regulatory environment that is supportive of innovation. Recent, ongoing regulatory reforms have the goals of minimising the regulatory and administration burden for businesses, whist ensuring the timely access to quality therapeutic goods for consumers. As a part of this commitment, the regulator has approved the use of many new active and exci pient ingredients for use in listed medicines, including 71 new ingredients in 2017. This will support the industry to innovate further and formulate new products to meet consumer demand. The Australian complementary medicine s industry is expected to continue its positive growth trajectory, increasing innovation -rich manufa cturing and providing a significant contribution to our country's exports.

Sales of complementary medicines are steadily increasing across the globe as consumers seek ways to proactively manage their health. Regulatory standards between countries are becoming more aligned, and there is greater discourse about the integration of complementary medicines with conventional medicine as recognition grows regarding the links betw een optimal nutrition and health. The provision of high quality products is fundamental to the goal of the Australian complementary medicines industry of enhancing consumers' health. The Australian industry is fortunate to be recognised as a premium bran d in the complementary medicines sector, stemming from our strict manufacturing standards and Australia's well -deserved reputation for a clean and well -regulated environment for food and medicines. In Australia, the regulation of complementary medicines f alls within the remit of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which has the responsibility of regulation of all therapeutic goods, including medicines and medical devices. Our regulatory system is seen as one of the most stringent in the world. Evidence is growing in a number of areas that complementary medicines offer a valuable and cost- effective way to improve health outcomes. Complementary medicines research is essential for continuing to establish the safety and efficacy of complementary medicines, to contribute to understanding best practice for integrative health care, and to develop innovative new products. Australia has formidable complementary medicines research institutions that hol d an international reputation for excellence. The Australian complementary medicines industry, with high quality products supported by one of the most rigorous regulatory frameworks in the world and exceptional research institutions, has much to offer - quite simply, the best of natural health. Dusko Pejnovic President Complementary Medicines Australia 7Australian Research & Development Capabilities Australia is fortunate to be home to world-leading research institutions for complementary medicines, including the Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine (ARCCIM) at the University of Technology Sydney, and the NICM Health Research Institute (NICM) at Western Sydney University. ARCCIM is an outstanding public health and health services research centre focusing on traditional, complementary and integrative health care and brings together experts in epidemiology and health economics. Its work has received substantial government funding, including prestigious research fellowships from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Australian Research Council (ARC). Case Study: NICM Health Research Institute A principal complementary medicine research institute in Australia, NICM Health Research Institute, is soon to move to the Westmead precinct, which is one of the largest health, education, research and training precincts in the Southern Hemisphere. This is a unique opportunity to build capacity for a robust complementary medicine sector in Australia and internationally, and to contribute to informed healthcare choices. The new home of NICM Health Research Institute, a landmark heritage building in the heart of the Westmead precinct, will include: 5,000 m2 of research, teaching, clinical space for 100+ staff and research students Expansion of clinical trials platform Expansion of TGA herbal analysis, R & D, pharmacology laboratories Integrative medicine clinic and dispensary Conference facilities Expansion of NICM education and training program NICM has created a broad network of significant research partnerships with international organisations in government and industry, including a number of prestigious universities, hospitals and other agencies in China, Asia, Europe and the US. NICM's strong credentials in Chinese medicine are well recognised and form the foundation for two major partnerships with China Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences and Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. NICM is also working with a number of industry partners in China to advance evidence based analysis focusing on quality, safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicines. medicine university , Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (BUC Australia also boasts excellent research centres outside of the university sector, such as the Endeavour College of Natural Health and the Blackmores Institute. The Endeavour College of Natural Health is a leading higher education provider for complementary and integrative healthcare, in part due to the value placed upon practice-relevant research. The Blackmores Institute, the academic and professional arm of Blackmores Limited, was established in 2012 with a vision to improve and promote the quality use of natural medicine via a focus on research and education. 8 Australian Regulation of Complementary Medicines The Australian regulatory regime for complementary medicines is such that it is viewed internationally as the consumer protection benchmark. Regulated under Australian law The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is part of the Australian Government Department of Health, and is responsible for regulating therapeutic goods, including pre scription medicines, vaccines, medical devices, and complementary medicines such as vitamins, minerals and herbal products. Based in Canberra, the TGA is responsible for administering the activities prescribed under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, the same Act under which it was established. The Act provides for a national system of controls relating to the quality, safety, efficacy, performance and timely availability of therapeutic goods used in Australia or exporte d from Australia. These controls are risk-based, with a tiered system for the regulation of all medicines, including complementary medicines. Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) Unless specifically exempt, complementary medicines supplied in Australia are required to be entered onto the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) maintained by the TGA. Unless they are included on the ARTG, complementary medicines cannot legally be imported, exported, manufactured, or supplied to consumers. Medicines that are included in the ARTG have an AUST L or AUST R number displayed on the pack. Information held in the ARTG includes: product name and formulation details sponsor (company) and manufacturer details The vast majority of CMs are in the lower risk listed category, and there are about 140 products in the higher risk registered category. Listed Medicines Registered Medicines Usually considered to be low -risk medicines Products with well -known ingredients, usually with a long history of use The majority are self -selected by consumers and used for self- treatment Must display an 'AUST L' number on the label as proof of listing on the ARTG May only make health claims permitted for usein listed med icines Must comply with all legislative requirementsrelating to quality, safety an efficacyMedicines assessed as having a higher level of risk must be registered Rigorous and detailed assessment, includingcomprehensive evaluation of safety, quality a nd efficacy Must display and 'AUST R' number on the label as proof of registration ; high-risk registered products include prescription medicines Registered complementary medicines are products that are higher risk that listed medicines, based on their ing redients or the in dications made for the medicine 9Strict Manufacturing Standards In Australia, complementary medicines must be manufactured in accordance with the principles of the PIC/S Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice GMP in TGA approved and licensed facilities. PIC/S GMP addresses requirements relating to quality management, personnel, premises and equipment, documentation, production, quality control, contract manufacture and analysis, complaints and product recall, and self-inspection. Recent Regulatory Reforms Recognising the need for an appropriate and contemporary regulatory environment the Government announced the Review of Medical and Medical Devices Regulation Review ( MMDR) in 2014. The MMDR was established by then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, to identify areas of unnecessary regulation that could be streamlined and opportunities to enhance the regulatory frame work so that Australia continues to be well -positioned to respond effectively to gl obal trends in the development, manufacture, marketing and regulation of therapeutic goods. The Australian Government accepted the majority of the Review recommendations. Amendments are steadily being made to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to support th e implementation of the Government's response to the Review recommendations . October 2014 The Prime Minister announces a Review by an Independent Expert Panel July 2015 Review into legislative framework commensurate to the levels of risk of products September 2016 Cabinet review report and accepts Expert Panel Recommendations March 2018 TGA Stakeholder Forums Legislation introduced into Parliament 10New As sessment Pathway for Complementary Medicine: A recent reform to the regulatory system is the addition of a new pathway for listing a product on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). This pathway will allow for pre -market assessment for a product to make a specific higher level health claim or claims. The pathway also introduces a much needed mechanism for regulatory protection for propriety resear ch and clinical trials. Permi tted Indications: The gov ernment accepted the Review recommendation for the introduction of a list of 'Permitted Indications' for low -risk Listed complementary medicines. This create s a definitive list of indications from which sponsors must exclusively draw and will help reduce inadvertent non -compliance. The industry has been working with the TGA to ensure that the list is comprehensive. Adver tising & Complaints System : The current advertis ing pre -approval system wi ll be phased out over a two year period. The regu latory changes also include the establishment of a streamlined complaints system within the TGA. The decision to provide, through the regulator, a single bo dy to manage all complaints is expected to help deliver consistency in decision -making, compliance and appropriate enforcement. Regulat ory Alignment The TGA has active working relationships with many international agencies and overseas regulators, and has emphasised buildin g institutional relationships to streamline both imports and exports. The TGA is committed to contributing to Australia's health system through best practice regulation of health products, and safeguarding the health of consumers through effective, timely and risk proportionate regul ation of therapeutic goods.xiii 11Complementary Medicines Australia Complementary Medicines Australia (CMA) is the peak industry body for the complementary medicines industry, representing stakeholders across the value chain, including manufacturers, raw material suppliers, distributors, consultants, retailers, allied health professionals and educators.
