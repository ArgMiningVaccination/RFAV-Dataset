Living with Alzheimer's is not living at all. Masking the effects with toxic chemicals that become addictive is NO SOLUTION. Understanding ALL the CAUSES of your Brain Dysfunction is important. Developing a true solution that addresses that CAUSE is vital for your health and well being. We are here to find TRUE SOLUTIONS to your health concerns. To Request an Action Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Senile dementia - Alzheimer's type (SDAT); SDAT Dementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one form of dementia that gradually gets worse over time. It affects memory, thinking, and behavior. You are more likely to get Alzheimer's disease (AD) if you: The following may also increase your risk, although this is not well proven: There are two types of AD: The cause of AD is not clear. Your genes and environmental factors seem to play a role. Aluminum, lead, and mercury deposits within the brain may be an underlying cause of AD. SYMPTOMS Dementia symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including: Symptoms of MCI include: The early symptoms of AD can include: People with severe AD can no longer: Other symptoms that may occur with AD: SIGNS AND TESTS A skilled health care provider can often diagnose AD disease with the following steps: A diagnosis of AD is made when certain symptoms are present, and by making sure other causes of dementia are not present. Tests may be done to rule out other possible causes of dementia, including: Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may be done to look for other causes of dementia, such as a brain tumor or stroke. In the early stages of dementia, brain image scans may be normal. In later stages, an MRI may show a decrease in the size of different areas of the brain. While the scans do not confirm the diagnosis of AD, they do exclude other causes of dementia (such as stroke and tumor). However, the only way to know for certain that someone has AD is to examine a sample of their brain tissue after death. The following changes are more common in the brain tissue of people with AD: DRUG TREATMENT Medicines are used to help slow down the rate at which symptoms become worse. The benefit from these drugs is usually small. You and your family may not notice much of a change. Before using these medicines, ask the doctor or nurse: Medicines for AD include: Side effects include stomach upset, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle cramps, and fatigue. Possible side effects include agitation or anxiety. Other medicines may be needed to control aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors. Examples include: These are usually given in very low doses due to the risk of side effects including an increased risk of death. It may be necessary to stop any medications that make confusion worse. Such medicines may include: Never change or stop taking any medicines without first talking to your doctor. For additional information and resources for people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers, see Alzheimer's disease support groups. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You There is no cure for AD. The goals of treatment are: [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You SUPPLEMENTS Some people believe certain vitamins and herbs may help prevent or slowdown AD. There is no strong evidence that Synthetic Folate (vitamin B6), synthetic vitamin B12, and synthetic vitamin E prevent AD or slows the disease once it occurs. Using Whole Food Supplements can offer better results rather than using synthetic vitamins. High-quality studies have not shown that ginkgo biloba lowers the chance of developing dementia. DO NOT use ginkgo if you take blood-thinning medications like warfarin (Coumadin) or a class of antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). If you are considering any drugs or supplements, you should talk to your [Holistic Chiropractor](holistic-chiropractor.asp) first. Remember that herbs and supplements available over the counter are NOT regulated by the FDA and are of questionable ingredients. Working with a [Holistic Chiropractor](holistic-chiropractor.asp) who has a working knowledge of nutrition and neurology is prudent. Understanding what is involved and working out a treatment plan based on realistic expectations and potential for results is important before beginning any treatment regime. Using different Whole Food Supplements, Herbs and Homeopathic remedies specific for the needs of the individual is warranted when supporting the health and wellness of the individual. Others have benefited from Acupuncture, Homeopathy or Naturopathy when dealing with AD. How quickly AD gets worse is different for each person. If AD develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly. Actively working with your [Holistic Chiropractor](holistic-chiropractor.asp) who can help monitor your health and adjust your program as things change is warranted. Patients with AD often die earlier than normal, although a patient may live anywhere from 3 - 20 years after diagnosis. The final phase of the disease may last from a few months to several years. During that time, the patient becomes totally disabled. Death usually occurs from an infection or organ failure. Although there is no proven way to prevent AD, there are some practices that may be worth incorporating into your daily routine, particularly if you have a family history of dementia. Talk to your doctor about any of these approaches, especially those that involve taking a medication or supplements. Working with a [Holistic Chiropractor](holistic-chiropractor.asp) who has a working knowledge of nutrition and neurology is the best place to start before moving to the more invasive medications.
