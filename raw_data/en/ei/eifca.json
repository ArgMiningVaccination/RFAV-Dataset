The report in your hands describes the achievements of one of America's premier Departments of Medicine prior to the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic. During this past academic year, the Department continued its tradition of providing superb, high quality care to ever-increasing numbers of outpatients and inpatients, both on BIDMC's main campus and at an ever-growing number of community health centers. We continued to expand our structural heart and congestive heart failure programs, we enhanced our interdepartmental collaborative efforts in transplantation, and we continued to expand our innovative approaches towards immunotherapy in cancer care. At the same time, we continued the planning for our new inpatient building and we have accelerated our collaborative clinical efforts throughout the Beth Israel Lahey Health network. Our educators led the way in developing new curricula at Harvard Medical School and continued to recruit and train superb classes of interns, residents, and fellows. Again, our educators were honored repeatedly for their dedication, ingenuity, and effectiveness. Our researchers continued to break new ground in cancer, vaccine development, rheumatologic, metabolic, renal, and cardiac diseases, and we continued to strengthen our mentoring of young investigators and junior faculty members of all types. We welcomed Gyongyi Szabo, BIDMC's new Chief Academic Officer, to our Department. As a truly outstanding Hepatologist and liver investigator, Dr. Szabo will collaborate with Dr. Afdhal and colleagues in the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition to further develop a comprehensive liver research program of international stature. Although this Annual Report describes the year's events prior to the pandemic, reflecting on the past year from this new perspective renews the pride we have in our missions and our confidence that these missions will endure and flourish, no matter what challenges the pandemic has in store.

It has been an incredibly eventful beginning for our new system, and I could not be more proud of how BILH and the Department of Medicine has responded to the many challenges we faced and continue to face. Throughout the entire coronavirus pandemic, from our early preparedness plans and managing the surge in Massachusetts, to recovering and beginning to adapt to a 'new normal,' the Department acted quickly, effectively, and collaboratively to care for our patients and for one another during unprecedented times. Every member of our Department contributed to managing this crisis: the Vaccine and Virology lab is at the forefront of the race to develop a vaccine, faculty provided surge coverage for inpatient COVID-19 floors, staff converted clinical spaces to accommodate additional patients on ventilators, and residents developed a program to donate iPads to connect loved ones with isolated patients. These are just a few examples, among many, that demonstrate the versatility, talent, and commitment we have within the Department and at BIDMC. It's been a year of ups and downs met by change and innovation, and I'm eager to see what the coming months bring for the Department of Medicine, BIDMC, and Beth Israel Lahey Health. I hope you are as well. Kevin Maguire, MS, Chief Administrative Officer, Department of Medicine BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 5Nezam Afdhal, MD Nezam Afdhal, MD, was named Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. He is the Charlotte and Irving Rabb Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. His new role is a continuation of his 19 years at BIDMC as a clinician, researcher, educator, and mentor within the Division. He succeeds J.

The Department's educational programs serve 164 residents, over 100 fellows, and hundreds of medical students, including over 150 in Harvard Medical School clinical clerkships annually. Nearly 200 of our faculty members teach in undergraduate HMS courses, and both our clinical clerkships and clinical are award-winning. Each year, we engage in many new education projects. Below, we've highlighted just a few of the most exciting new ideas and educational enhancements that are underway: AMA Residency Innovation Grant: With the support of this grant, the educational leadership team for ambulatory training is transforming the way ambulatory training is designed and implemented, moving our residents toward a population health strategy. The project will develop a novel educational and clinical dashboard to track the impact of their innovations and also measure the health of our training program. The project explores the intersection of education and clinical care for our residents and their patients, implementing resident population health team meetings and pre-visit huddles. Finally, the project will develop a novel Health Systems Curriculum to train residents in the most important domains of Population Health. The curriculum includes a comprehensive high value care component, a broad health equity curriculum, and training on physician wellness. Resident as Leader Curriculum: Clinical leadership is essential to post-graduate medical training, yet skills for clinical leaders have historically been taught through an apprenticeship model, resulting in variable resident readiness to lead teams. To address this training gap, the residency program implemented a longitudinal Resident-as-Leader curriculum for rising PGY2 residents and is developing a novel, validated, direct observation-of-leadership instrument. Direct observations of residents following curricular intervention have revealed a significant increase in clinical leadership skills and reduced performance variation across residents. BI Innovation Group (BIG) Hack- a-thon: Developed and led by a group of residents, BIG provides a community, resources, and training for residents interested in improving medicine and healthcare delivery through innovations in technology, business, and health systems. The wildly successful Hack-a-thon was the first BIG event of 2019, an intensive brainstorming event bringing together students and residents across the Harvard Medical School network and MIT to consider novel approaches to healthcare informed by artificial intelligence. Live Model Simulations: Over the past few years, internal medicine has seen an increase in the use of bedside ultrasound imaging to enhance the care of our patients. While BIDMC has been teaching and using ultrasound for years, we designed a new ultrasound training using live models as part of our academic half day curriculum. During each four-hour session, residents rotate through five different stations, utilizing ultrasounds to evaluate live models. With expert faculty guidance, each resident has ample time to practice obtaining different ultrasound views, including basic echocardiogram, pleural ultrasound, and abdominal ultrasound. The BIDMC Clinician Educator Track for Fellows: This is the first focused education track for internal medicine fellows in the nation. Recognizing the unique challenges in subspecialty education, our program combines a longitudinal didactic curriculum, mentored research in medical education, and teaching experiences across the medical center. Participants have come from seven different BIDMC subspecialty fellowships, and graduates of the program have gone on to hold leadership roles in medical education and publish in the medical education literature. Trauma-Informed Care (TIC): The leaders of our Harvard student clinical skills curriculum course are incorporating the principles of TIC into history-taking and physical exam skills. Students are first taught the fundamental concepts of TIC via didactics and online materials, then practice these skills with observation and coaching by faculty preceptors. The TIC curriculum is also being rolled out to residents and across the department's non-physician clinical staff. Primary Care Innovation Laboratory: The primary care program and our clinical practice leadership have created an innovation lab for residents who are members of the primary care track. This novel program aims to use our primary care annual operating plan to train residents in health systems research, primary care innovation, and quality improvement, by combining education and practice operations into an interdependent and mutually beneficial team that produces better care for patients, better training for residents, and sustainability to our large academic primary care practice. Over the past year, with the support of the laboratory practice and mentorship from local experts, residents developed an innovative transitional care management program and a predictive model for patient retention in primary care. Education Eileen Reynolds, MD Vice Chair for Education C. Christopher Smith, MD Associate Vice Chair for Education Anjala Tess, MD Associate Vice Chair for Education Richard Schwartzstein, MD Richard M. Schwartzstein, MD, was named Chief of the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine. Dr. Schwartzstein assumes this leadership role after 33 years in the Division, including 14 years as Associate Chief. He succeeds J.

Dr. Szabo will further our top- tier research and educational programs, fostering our work with her exemplary expertise. 8 / BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 9 New Leadership (continued) Vice Chair Updates As Vice Chair for Quality, I'm proud of our Department's Quality Improvement and Patient Safety program, which is among the most widely respected in the country. We have strived to create an organization that ensures highly reliable care, with follow-up on all tests and referrals using closed-loop methods. Some recent examples of our QI program's interventions include developing systems to reliably offer Lung Cancer Screening to all appropriate patients based on their smoking history and age, building medication safety guidance programs into Provider Order Entry systems, tracking all consults for timely responses, and monitoring procedures for safety, complications, and efficacy. For nearly 20 years, all of our medical residents have learned the language and methodology of analyzing cases from a QI perspective as part of a QI rotation. Throughout the QI rotation, residents participate in all hospital QI conferences and work with their preceptors and colleagues on QI projects. During their rotation, residents perform a root cause analysis of an adverse event or medical error with guidance from an expert faculty preceptor and then report their findings to the Department's Medical Peer Review Committee. These analyses often lead to significant changes in how we deliver care, and in many cases, the resident is the key to enacting the transformation. Many of our trainees go on to leadership positions in healthcare quality, both at BIDMC and elsewhere, as a result of their experiences here. Another venue for our trainees to learn about optimizing medical care is the weekly Morbidity & Mortality conference run by the Chief Medical Residents. The M&M conference not only reviews clinical teaching points, but also analyzes how care was delivered and focuses on whether we could have done better. Our goal is to make QI and patient safety integral to all of our residents' education, because we believe this is one of the best ways to ensure the care we provide is of the highest quality. As the Vice Chair for Career Development and Mentoring, my goal is to serve the professional development needs of our faculty as they advance their careers in cutting-edge clinical care, education, and research. One way we support our colleagues is by offering one on one Harvard Medical School CV consultations, which nearly 60 faculty members in the Department availed themselves of over the last year. Dr. Thomas Lamont, Emeritus Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, will also assist with CV reviews going forward, particularly for investigators. This year, we implemented a revised annual faculty review process, in order to best make use of faculty's career conference meetings with their Division Chiefs. We also plan to pilot an electronic version of this process going forward. Additionally, we instituted writing groups for faculty, where colleagues working on similar paper formats committed to meeting regularly to support each other in the process of writing a manuscript from start to finish. We're excited that this popular service will continue in the coming academic year.Another avenue for career development and mentoring at BIDMC is The Franklin Epstein Society, led by Dr. Steven Freedman. As our Research Vice Chairs noted in their message, the Epstein Society supports the needs of our researchers from their time as residents through their mid-career stages. As the group continues to grow in size and scope, Dr. Freedman reviews grant applications, co-writes institutional letters of support, and hosts monthly seminars that cover a wide range of topics, from mentorship to seeking industry support. 10 / BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 11Our Department has a long history of providing clinical care at the cutting edge. Traditionally, for our patients living in communities outside of the Boston area, receiving these state-of-the-art therapies required traveling into Boston. With the growth of our network, patients' desire for local care, and limited capacity at the medical center, we've undertaken an effort to extend these higher-level services from our academic medical center into the community. Extending BIDMC's medical care to the community involves multiple layers of collaboration. Many times, we need to increase treatment capabilities in the community through physician recruitment. In other cases, physicians based primarily in the medical center may need to travel to the community to provide care or direct new services. The overarching objective is that care received in the community is of the same high quality that would be received at the medical center. By combining these strategies alongside collaborations with affiliated partners to share resources and manage efficiencies, we've had demonstrated successes in shifting cutting edge care to the community. We're also working to provide access to the medical center when an even higher level of care becomes necessary. Providing the right care at the right place will improve the health of our overall population as well as the institutions engaged in this shared mission. Vice Chair Updates (continued) Quality Mark Aronson, MDVice Chair, QualityCareer Development and Mentoring Grace Huang, MD Vice Chair, Career Development and Mentoring Clinical Care in the Community Donald Cutlip, MD Vice Chair, Clinical Care in the Community A core component of the Department of Medicine's mission is cutting-edge research. Discoveries by our investigators lead to the prevention, cure, and improved treatment of human diseases, as well as enhancement of the quality of life for those who live with chronic diseases. In our roles as Vice Chairs of Research and Research Strategy, we consider it of the utmost importance to develop and support an outstanding research program at the forefront of discoveries that will further medical care. One way the Department ensures that research continues to thrive is through our support for young investigators. The Franklin Epstein Society, directed by Dr. Steve Freedman, mentors over 30 young researchers with active Career Development (K) Awards from the NationalInstitutes of Health as theytransition toward ResearchProject (RO1) Grants to independent academiccareers. Society develops a collaborativecommunity of new investigators,but also offers institutionalsupport and feedback relatedto career development in basic,translational, clinical, andoutcomes research. In addition to the K-Grant awardees, nearly 300 faculty members in the Department of Medicine have active grants, by which they mentor hundreds more trainees and laboratory staff. Our research funding in the 2018-2019 Fiscal Year was over $180 million, consisting of government, foundation, corporate, and donor sources. (See funding details on page 36). We continue to be one of the best-funded medical school departments of medicine in the nation, and BIDMC consistently ranks as a national leader among independent hospitals in National Institutes of Health funding. The Department of Medicine plays a large role and accounts for nearly 70% of that funding. This year, our faculty published paradigm-shifting research in the world's leading scientific and medical journals, including Nature, Science, Cell, Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine (see more publications on page 37). Our investigators also continue to be recognized for their excellence in research, both via honors and awards from national organizations, as well as through elections to academic societies such as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (see more accolades on page 18). Research Barbara Kahn, MD, MSVice Chair, Research Strategy Peter Weller, MD Vice Chair, Research That addition will be an approximately 345,000 square foot inpatient building. The new space will be a modern, state-of-the-art environment where patients will receive the highest caliber of healthcare. It will be the medical center's first new building in 20 years, located on the corner of Francis Street and Pilgrim Road on West Campus. With cognizance of our role in a rapidly changing healthcare environment, the medical center is developing more resources to meet the needs of our patients and their communities. \"This new building will further strengthen our ability to deliver the highest quality care to our patients and fully support our committed physicians, nurses, and staff,\" said Peter Healy, President of BIDMC. \"This new structure will propel Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center forward in delivering on our commitments to the people and communities we serve. We are proud to be at the forefront of innovation in healthcare \u2014 for the benefit of our patients, our communities, and our region.\" The building was designed with careful attention to key considerations, including thoughtful input from physicians, staff, patients, and the Longwood area community. Their collaboration helped to inform the sophisticated design. \"This groundbreaking is the culmination of two years of planning and community engagement,\" said Walter Armstrong, Senior Vice President Capital Facilities and Engineering at BIDMC. The pillars of the building design focus on integration within West Campus, incorporating both patient-friendly spaces and environmental sustainability. The building will connect to the Rosenberg Building and the Farr Building Bridge at multiple locations to facilitate access for patients, families, and caregivers. The location will also facilitate the sharing of clinical support services with existing inpatient programs on West Campus. The facility will include up to 128 single-bedded, family-friendly patient rooms. An expansion of single patient rooms will replace the double-bedded rooms currently on West Campus. There will also be 30 intensive care unit (ICU) rooms to facilitate delivery of the highest quality care to patients in critical condition. To make the new building a comprehensive patient space, the design expanded past the hospital room and up to the roof, where there will be an accessible rooftop green space and a healing garden for patients, families, and caregivers. The building design is wired for the future, accommodating sophisticated technology, advanced treatments, and team-based care. Advancing the cutting-edge work of our specialists, the building will have surgical suites large enough to accommodate the most advanced surgical procedures and imaging technology, as well as versatile diagnostic and procedural suites with state-of- the-art equipment to handle the most acute patient needs. The same attention has been paid to the role of sustainability, as the building will be energy efficient and environmentally conscious, consistent with BIDMC's commitment to environmental stewardship. The new building will also include a medical helicopter landing pad, relocating from the current location on the roof of the adjacent Rosenberg Building. Helicopter access is crucial to support BIDMC's important role as a major Level 1 Trauma Center for our region. \"This new building will rise from BIDMC's extraordinary ability to collaborate and innovate, our research and educational missions and our primary commitment to exceptional, compassionate care for all,\" said Kevin Tabb, MD, President and CEO of Beth Israel Lahey Health. The competition of construction and opening of the new addition are expected in 2022. With its development at the start of the new decade, BIDMC is positioning itself for continued success as a leader in patient care.

Rarely is the innovation quite so physical as a ten-story structure, but at last June's groundbreaking ceremony, BIDMC began its latest cutting-edge addition to the medical center.Get to Know the New BuildingAs part of BILH, BIDMC joined colleagues from Addison Gilbert Hospital, Anna Jaques Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital\u2014Milton, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital\u2014Needham, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital\u2014Plymouth, Hospital, Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, Lahey Medical Center\u2014Peabody, Mount Auburn Hospital, New England Baptist Hospital, and Winchester Hospital to form the new system. Combined, these institutions include four academic and teaching hospitals affiliated with Harvard Medical School and Tufts University School of Medicine. Alongside BILH's 13 hospitals and numerous affiliates, BIDMC and the Department of Medicine are committed to the idea that everyone deserves high quality healthcare. BILH is a population health enterprise, working to strengthen both quality of care and patient health outcomes, as well as addressing health disparities and public health issues. Within the new system, patients have access to more than 800 primary care doctors and 3,500 specialty physicians. Notably, patients are increasingly able to see their care teams closer to their homes and communities. Additionally, BILH facilitates access to community healthcare through affiliates in Eastern Massachusetts, which include Atrius Health, the Cambridge Health Alliance, the Community Care Alliance (Bowdoin Street Health Center, Charles River Community Health, and The Dimock Center), Fenway Health, Outer Cape Health Services, South Cove Community Health Center, HCA Parkland Medical Center, HCA Portsmouth Regional Hospital, Hebrew SeniorLife, Joslin Diabetes Center, King Edward Memorial Hospital, Lawrence General Hospital, Signature Healthcare, Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, and St. Joseph Hospital. \"With the creation of Beth Israel Lahey Health, we have an unprecedented opportunity to care for our patients and our communities in new and better ways,\" said Kevin Tabb, MD, President and CEO of Beth Israel Lahey Health, on March 1st, 2019, the day the new system launched. \"This is just the beginning of our journey to transform health care in Massachusetts into what we know it can and should be.\" \"We believe everyone should have access to high-quality, affordable care, whether they live on Cape Cod, the North Shore or somewhere in between,\" he added. \"Through local and system partnerships, as well as the enthusiasm and talent of all our employees and providers, we will invest in and strengthen community-based care, informed by innovation and discovery.\" BILH's leadership team has shaped the legacies of its member organizations. This team includes Gyongyi Szabo, MD, PhD, Hon. ScD, Chief Academic Officer of BIDMC and BILH, who began her new role in July of 2019. Dr. Szabo is a member of the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition within the Department of Medicine, as well as an accomplished physician, scientist and mentor. (Read more about Dr. Szabo and the Department's other new leaders on page 8). Over the last year, the new system has begun to implement some of the many plans to provide high-quality, affordable care to patients across Massachusetts. In October, BILH announced plans to bring a broad range of new health care services to the City of Quincy. The new initiative provides highly-specialized and nationally-recognized models of orthopedic care developed by New England Baptist Hospital to the community hospitals in Newburyport and Beverly. In December, Anna Jaques Hospital and Beverly Hospital began offering the New England Baptist Hospital model of care for inpatient joint replacement surgery on the hip and knee, as well as spine surgery. In 2018, after the definitive agreement was signed and the various member hospitals began preparations to form the new system, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey imposed a number of conditions before approving the creation of BILH. Now, a year into the merger, the first report on those conditions found that BILH is meeting every imposed standard, including reaching out to low-income patients and expanding the availability of mental health care. In a recent interview with the Boston Globe, Dr. Tabb reflected on the last year's progress. \"We said we were going to do a whole host of things, and we're doing them. We're moving pretty quickly.\" On March 1st, 2019, BIDM C and the Department of Medicine b ecame part of Beth Israel Lahey Hea lth (BILH) - a new heal thcare system that brings together academic medi cal centers and tea ching, community, a nd specialty hospitals in a shared mission to expand a ccess to exceptiona l healthcare for more than 1.3 millio n people in Eastern M assachusetts.

Mark Andermann knows w ell. As he describes that inner world, laboratory activity hums aro und him. A mouse mo ves within the confines of a massi ve microscope, so large it fills the entire r oom. The scope's screens light up wi th movi es of hundreds of indiv idual cel ls in the mouse's brain, each flashing as it bec omes active. In this given moment, cho osing to pay attention to the world around us provides a peak i nto the wo rld inside of some thing else. Each time someone asks how we're feeling, we direct o ur focus away from external stimuli and turn it inward, becoming aware of any number of salient signals from our bodies\u2014a headache, a stomach cramp\u2014through a process called interoceptive awareness. Interoception is how we are able to tell when we crave a meal, need a glass of water, or are sated of hunger and thirst. For researchers, pivotal understanding of precisely how the brain can estimate our body's state and react accordingly remains elusive. \"Despite the broad relevance of interoceptive awareness to both medicine and psychiatry, we know shockingly little about the conditions that regulate our awareness of different body signals,\" Andermann says. \"We know even less about the precise brain circuits that underlie this awareness.\" In the flurry of daily activity within Andermann's lab, researchers are working to unravel those intricate processes. In 2019, Andermann received a 2019 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Pioneer Award. The NIH Director's Pioneer Award challenges investigators at all career levels to pursue new research directions and develop groundbreaking, high-impact approaches to a broad area of biomedical, behavioral, or social science. The Pioneer Award is one of four awards introduced by the NIH's High-Risk, High-Reward Research program to fund highly innovative and unusually impactful biomedical or behavioral research proposed by extraordinarily creative scientists. Andermann, a neuroscientist by training, was also a past recipient of another NIH High-Risk, High-Reward Research program honor: the New Innovator Award for outstanding young investigators. With the support of the Pioneer Award, Andermann and his team will continue their research to further investigate the role of the brain's insular cortex in interoception.Mark Andermann, PhD \u2014Mark Andermann, PhDA Pioneer of Perception A principal investigator in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism and an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Mark Andermann, PhD, is supported by an NIH Director's Pioneer Grant as his lab seeks to understand how the needs of the body are sensed, learned, and remembered. Andermann and his team have developed a mouse model within the Department of Medicine's Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism that involves monitoring the activity of hundreds of individual brain cells in the insular cortex. This model aims to determine exactly what is happening in the brain when a hungry animal is eating a meal and feeling increasingly full. In a January 2020 paper in Neuron, Andermann and colleagues demonstrated how the insular cortex region of the brain orchestrates the interpretation of and reaction to signals received from the body. The study observed that when mice were not fed for many hours, the activity pattern of insular cortex neurons reflected current levels of hunger. Once they did eat, this pattern shifted gradually over hours to reflect satiety. When mice saw visual clues predicting impending availability of food\u2014not unlike a hungry human seeing a sign for a nearby restaurant\u2014the insular cortex appears to simulate a future sated state for a few seconds, before returning to the activity pattern related to hunger. These findings represent initial steps towards understanding the neural basis of interoception, which could allow future research to address key questions for a host of medical issues, including eating disorders, drug addiction, and obesity. Their findings provided direct support for human studies that hypothesized the insular cortex is involved in imagining or predicting how we will feel after eating or drinking. \"Dr. Andermann is developing unparalleled, technologically-advanced approaches for understanding how the brain receives and processes signals from inside the body. This award provides the means to greatly expand efforts in this important, unmet research area,\" says Bradford Lowell, MD, PhD, a member of the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism and a Professor of Medicine at HMS. Andermann and Lowell are frequent collaborators; Lowell's lab at BIDMC studies how the brain senses the body's energy stores and subsequently uses that information to stimulate hunger and compel one to eat. The neural circuits involved in those processes interface with the same neural circuits and processes that Andermann investigates. Currently, Andermann's lab is working to directly manipulate specific patterns of activity in the insular cortex. They are attempting to change the brain's simulation of a future sated state when presented with food or water, thus making eating and drinking more or less rewarding. \"If successful, our approach might provide an intervention that could reduce seeking of unhealthy rewards\u2014processed foods, drug abuse\u2014without affecting seeking other, healthier rewards,\" Andermann explains. \"This research could ultimately provide a roadmap to regulate human interoceptive awareness and predictions across a range of medical and psychiatric diseases.\" \" A t any given moment, our brains must choose to pay attention to the world around us, or to the world inside us.\" 16 / BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 17Photo by Anna OlivellaBIDMC Named LGBTQ Healthcare Equality Leader by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for the ninth consecutive year.

Eventually, in what he now jokingly describes as a delusion of grandeur, he decided to create his own. What began as a side project amidst the bedlam of resident schedules has grown into an integral part of Rodman's career; he now records live episodes at the American College of Physicians (ACP) annual meetings, nearly 20 colleagues serve on editorial and review boards, and the ACP provides Continuing Medical Education (CME) credit for listening to the podcast. The early Bedside Rounds episodes function as extensions of Rodman's personal reading, capturing snippets of his rare free time and covering topics from the death of the Roman Emperor Hadrian to the creation of the smallpox vaccine. After his residency, Rodman joined BIDMC, first to complete a Global Health Fellowship in the Division of General Medicine, then to stay on as a hospitalist. As he began this new endeavor, he faced the decision of either abandoning the project or incorporating it into his practice and career. Luckily for his listeners, he chose to continue. One of the show's pivotal episodes recounts the story of Phineas Gage, the famous 19th century American railroad construction worker who improbably survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe. The injury was reported to affect his personality and behavior over the remaining 12 years of his life to the point that he was considered a totally different person. After visiting Gage's skull at Harvard Medical School's Warren Anatomical Museum and digging into primary and secondary literature about the case, Rodman had a startling realization: almost everything he'd learned about Gage in medical school was a lie. \"His personality didn't totally change!\" Rodman explains. \"A lot of things were exaggerated by doctors at the time to fit in a narrative about his case.\" This revelation helped shape the course of Bedside Rounds' future. \"It was when the podcast became more than me exploring an idea or a historical case, but truly telling a story,\" Rodman says. \"And acknowledging the larger humanistic, important points to these stories.\" As the podcast began to deliberately engage with bigger ideas behind the narratives it shared, listeners also began to engage exponentially. Rodman recalls the Gage episode as the moment where his core listenership expanded\u2014from several hundred downloads per episode to approximately 30,000. Adam Rodman, MD Taking Beds ide Rounds Anywhere and Everyw here On his international ly streamed and criti cally acclaimed Beds ide Rounds podcast, hospitalist Ad am Rodman, MD, guid es listeners throug h the weird, wonderful, and human stories that shape modern medicine.The Gage episode represented a turning point for the podcast, not only in terms of listenership, but when it began its metamorphosis into something more than it was, just as Rodman himself was growing as a physician and medical educator. Still telling historical stories, Bedside Rounds now also considers the intellectual, social, and cultural currents that shape modern medicine. \"For me, it's all about science and humanity,\" Rodman says. \"I was inspired to start digging deeper into the why of some of the things we're trained to do as physicians. I think a lot about humanism and its connection to the complexity of the relationship between doctors and patients.\" Bedside Rounds is also no longer Rodman's hobby, but an integral part of his work as a medical educator. It's become an extension of the teaching that he conducts on the wards, in the simulation lab, and in the classroom. Though he still records episodes at home, sitting under a duvet to create a soundproof miniature studio, his voice now reaches a massive number of physicians, medical students, and curious civilians. When asked why Bedside Rounds resonates with such a large and diverse group of listeners, Rodman turns both humble and contemplative. \"I think people see this complex, occasionally alienating system of medicine and they wonder why we do things the way we do,\" he says. \"So the podcast is an exploration, not only of how medicine came to be this complicated system, but of the decisions that got us where we are, and how looking back to connect with our roots can help us find opportunities to connect with our patients in the present.\" Rodman cites an example of a listener question that changed one of his long-held perspectives, both when evaluating patients and teaching medical students and residents. Someone inquired about a patient presenting with a temperature of 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit and claiming they \"run low\" and thus have a fever. The listener was curious: \"Are these patients telling the truth? Are they crazy? Am I crazy?\" Initially, Rodman thought his response would be to comfort the patient, but privately think something along the lines of, well, that's not how it works. As he began to research his reply, however, he stumbled into another one of his surprising discoveries. Amidst German manuscripts from the 1850s, Rodman found that a large dataset from that era was the basis for determining that the average human temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and that 100 degrees Fahrenheit constitutes a fever. \"How did they analyze that? Statistics didn't exist yet, but that's where we determined those numbers,\" Rodman says animatedly. \"Once statistics do exist and people start to do studies on soldiers, we see that the actual human body temperature could be in the 97-98 range. Then we have some really cool data from vaccine trials in the 1980s and 1990s that confirm a fever might actually be as low as 99.1 degrees, and 99.9 degrees is definitely a fever.\" This one moment gets right at the heart of Bedside Rounds: how Rodman's own natural curiosity has led him to new knowledge that not just improves his own practice as a hospitalist, but also the medical education of his students and every listener who tunes in. By his own hand, his wish as a resident for a truly excellent medical podcast came to fruition. 22 / BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 23\"The department is continuously evolving because we value education as an activity,\" said Anjala Tess, MD. \"People give faculty opportunity and guidance in their work and even if they don't know the answers, they will help you learn them yourself. Some places can have a culture of 'no' around new ideas. Ours is a culture of 'sounds cool, how?'\" When applying for residency in 1997, Tess knew already that she wanted to be a medical educator and chose BIDMC intentionally, as it was the only place discussing training residents in education. Unaware of the numerous educational roles she would later hold, the commitment to education at BIDMC turned out to be more true than she could have imagined. While holding numerous leadership roles, she teaches students of all levels from medical school up to fellowship. This spring, she and co-director Jennifer Stevens, MD, launched the Advanced Integrated Science Course on Health Systems Science. Designed with input from students, fellows, and faculty, the QI course is the first of its kind for medical students at HMS. In the 4-week course, students receive training in quality improvement with a later focus on data analysis for research and implementation science, and research opportunities at sites such as Ariadne, Dana Farber, and Atrius. Anita Vanka, MD, also a graduate of the residency program, now leads students from the very beginning of their time at HMS, as Co-Director of the Practice of Medicine course, the longest class in the first-year curriculum. After teaching foundational clinical skills in year one, she works with students again in year two as they come onto the wards, in her capacity as Associate Site Core I Medicine Clerkship Director. \"The most rewarding thing is to see them actively care for patients and discuss cases that I know they wouldn't have been able to a year ago. It's really special and wonderful to see that growth,\" said Vanka. Richard Schwartzstein, MD, leads education at BIDMC and HMS in countless ways: in his 25 years of teaching in the pre-clerkship curriculum, as the Director of the Shapiro Institute for Education and Research, Leading Minds: Education at Harvard Medical School \" T here's this famous expression, 'a curriculum is the manifestation of the soul of an institution' and I believe that's true of BIDMC. There is something special here about the openness to innovation and to creating new things. There is an agility and a nimbleness to BIDMC that is unique.\" \u2014 David Roberts, MD On any given day in the Longwood Medical Area, educational leaders at BIDMC are engaged with their students and ever-considering how to best provide the highest caliber of education. HMS students are learning from leaders in numerous specialties, many of whom completed their own training at the medical center. The prevailing focus on education at BIDMC has created a strong culture, built for the students by the faculty and enriched by the work of all.by implementing innovative programs like the new medical education research lab, and working with faculty to empower them to pursue education as a career path. In 2011, a major HMS curricular reform to improve first-year classroom learning began under the direction of Schwartzstein and Melanie Hoenig, MD, who co-chaired the steering committee working on this aspect of the new curriculum. \"This was a team effort from the educators. There were no top-down mandates about changes and we had buy-in from all the education stakeholders,\" said Hoenig. She is a devoted educator who serves as the course director for Homeostasis 2, a required course in the pre-clerkship curriculum that integrates the physiology and pathophysiology of the renal, endocrine and gastrointestinal systems. She also trains residents and Nephrology fellows and has established a program with Brigham and Women's Hospital for undergraduate students to give them a taste of kidney medicine and research. In 2015, HMS implemented the new curriculum for the pre-clerkship year. The new format utilizes a technique called Case- 24 / BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 25GENERAL MEDICINE \" E ducation is all about helping people find their passion and making them the best the y can be at what they love to do .\" \u2014 Sara Fazio, MD Chair of the Principal Clinical Experience Committee Advisory Dean and Dir ector of the Cannon Society at HMS Associat e Director of Education, HMS Center for Primary Care NEPHROLOGY \" E ducation is what we're going to learn together, because I have contex t but I want to promote the learner 's interest.

We got a grant from the university and studied it. We found that the learning environment was significantly better,\" said Schwartzstein. Ahead of implementation, Schwartzstein's physiology course piloted CBCL and showed that students who had struggled in prior courses performed better in CBCL than in the \"standard\" problem based learning tutorials. The new system emphasizes pre-class preparation and fosters a learning environment in which students are pushed to think critically and apply their knowledge to solve problems. \"We are trying to create life-long learners and that doesn't mean we have to cover everything, because the goal is creating learners who are curious and constantly assessing their own knowledge. Each learner has a responsibility for fueling their own fire to learn,\" said Hoenig. The curriculum came to fruition in 2019 as HMS graduated the first class of the new model's learners. Following implementation at HMS, Schwartzstein advised schools in London, Miami, and Los Angeles to help adapt similar reforms. After many years of leading education at BIDMC, Both David Roberts, MD, and Sara Fazio, MD, have moved into new roles at HMS. Following 16 years as the ambulatory clerkship director and subsequently overall Director of the Core Internal Medicine Clerkship at BIDMC, Fazio found a true passion in early medical education. She now serves as the Advisory Dean and Director of the Cannon Society, and Chair of the Principal Clinical Experience Committee, where she oversees the core clinical curriculum at HMS. She is currently shepherding the next wave of change at HMS for the students' core clinical year, examining the clerkships which have not undergone such a reform in decades. For HMS students, BIDMC is the primary clinical site where all clinical work during the first two years of medical school occurs. Given Fazio's experience as an educator and a former BIDMC resident and chief resident, she is uniquely insightful and well-positioned to apply her extensive knowledge to change the way that students learn during this pivotal year, providing more authentic roles in patient care and a system to improve competency-based assessment. Drawing from her clinical experience, she has already developed a model for a four-year primary care curriculum, designed to ensure all students have a strong foundation in the primary care competencies. As an Advisory Dean, she mentors and engages with HMS students daily and throughout their four years. \"I've found that as an educator, it's the students that keep you going. They push the limits of your knowledge and make you want to learn more and teach better. The students benefit from this environment of collegiality, passion, and drive, but we benefit from it too. We benefit tremendously,\" said Fazio. After many years as the Principal Clinical Experience Director overseeing all the clerkships, Roberts is now the Inaugural Dean for External Education at HMS. In 2014, the Office for External Education was founded to create innovative programs that reach an array of learners, using new technology and techniques. In six years, it has established a wide range of programs that run on every continent except Antarctica and are teaching online, in person, and in a hybrid fashion across the world. \"We built our online learning platform for incoming medical students and then when we opened it up to public applications, we had interest from lots and lots of people and companies like Novartis, and Google. If you had told me five years ago that we would be running programs in Malaysia, Mongolia, Egypt, London, Dubai, Shanghai, and so on, I would have been surprised,\" said Roberts. The essence of his role is creating things that did not exist before. No other medical school is teaching executive education programs and at this point, no other medical school is creating extensive online learning for future physicians. Roberts' ties to BIDMC remain strong as many of the educators who teach in or contribute to External Education programs and content are often Department of Medicine physicians. As these endeavors elevate and enrich the culture of education, there is a prevailing drive to keep BIDMC at the forefront of education and to make the necessary shifts to meet their learners' needs and prepare them for a changing professional and societal landscape. Medical education is changing. The role of physicians is changing. Teaching with that in mind involves both educating the educator and listening to the students. \"We have to get away from a mode of teaching that emphasizes, 'this is what's in my head and my job is to put it in your head,\" said Schwartzstein. \"We are helping the students develop their thinking skills. The biggest thing is empowering learners to think through problems, to develop deeper understanding.\" \"We're constantly adapting the curriculum to fit the themes that are happening, not just in medicine but culturally,\" said Vanka. \"And our students are driving it too. Any time you have your learners driving change, you are always on the cutting edge.\" 26 / BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 27\" I've found that as an educator, it's the studen ts that keep you going.

But to researchers, those words can also be a catalyst. A way of saying 'our knowledge is expanding.' A lack of knowledge is the root of the problem for individuals with rare bleeding disorders, as many will never receive a molecular diagnosis. Similarly, about half of the heritability for thrombotic disorders, such as pulmonary embolism, remains unexplained. Despite constant progress fueled by new technologies, there remain more questions than answers. Dr. Sol Schulman is working to change that as the recent recipient of the NIH Director's Early Independence Award. The award supports outstanding junior scientists with the intellect, scientific creativity, drive, and maturity to flourish independently, launch their own research careers, and bypass the traditional postdoctoral training period track. \"I'm a high-risk, high-reward type of scientist and that approach is designed for the grant's mechanism,\" Schulman says. \"If an experiment is most likely to work\u2014if I'm going to show that A goes to B and everyone thinks it's going to work\u2014then to me that's not that interesting. I am much more interested in finding something that is really different and totally unexpected.\" Schulman's research centers on the role of a protein called tissue factor (TF), which is the primary initiator of the blood coagulation cascade. The historic approach in clotting research has focused on the patient's plasma. Once blood is centrifuged, all the cells go to the bottom and the plasma remains on top. As a result, when the blood is analyzed, researchers only study the plasma without any of the missing cells, especially the cells that line the blood vessel. Schulman's strategy is to look at cells in their entirety, with a focus on the membrane protein TF that starts the blood coagulation cascade process. He utilizes functional genetics to create systematic genetic variation; instead of waiting for the rare patient to present with a clotting problem, his idea is to systematically eliminate the genes one by one. This genetic approach allows Schulman to identify new pathways that regulate the start of blood clotting on the surface of the cell. \"The functional genetic screens we do on the cells are part of finding what may be having an impact on the start of the blood clotting process,\" said Schulman. \"The genome is a big place and you can't look Sol Schulman, MD, PhD Early Investigator, Timely Advances A physician-scientist in the Division of Hemosta sis and Thrombosis, Sol S chulman, MD, PhD, received a 2019 N IH Director's Early I ndependenc e Award in support o f his ongoing research into tissue factor and its cont ribution to the p athogenesis and inher itance of broadly defined hemor rhag ic and thrombotic diseases. everywhere, but if the flashlight is telling you to look at A, B, C, and D, you can look at those instead of the full 20,000 genes.\" Schulman graduated in 2012 from HMS' combined MD/PhD program, a track specifically designed for physicians who are inclined towards a career in academic research. As a physician-scientist at BIDMC, Schulman conducts his research within the Division of Hemostasis and Thrombosis while seeing patients in a weekly clinic through the Division of Hematology and Oncology. As a non-malignant hematologist with an expert focus on bleeding and clotting disorders, he looks at molecular genetic sequencing of his patients. As a researcher, he then seeks to identify possible pathways for further examination. \"Training as a physician-scientist is invaluable,\" said Schulman. \"As a doctor, you're seeing the problems patients are facing and understanding what is important in a different way. It's energizing every time you see a patient and have to tell them, 'I don't know what you have,' to then go back to the lab and try to figure out why they have this bleeding problem.\" He also works as an Instructor of Medicine at HMS and is a co-director of the HST Hematology Course for Spring Semester, a joint Harvard and MIT program he participated in during his training. He is now educating future physician-scientists and encouraging them to pursue careers in Hematology, with his own work as an example of what's possible. Schulman was recognized with Celgene's Future Leader in Hematology Award and the American Society of Hematology Scholar Award. While the default pathway for physician-scientists is to receive a K-grant award and work under a mentor, the NIH award establishes Schulman as his own entity with his own lab. \"This award is essentially aiming to tell creative, talented people to take a chance,\" said Schulman. \"I'm excited to have this opportunity, and I couldn't do it without my mentors' support.\" Schulman cites Tom Rapoport, PhD, Bruce Furie, MD, Robert Flaumenhaft, MD, PhD, and Ken Bauer, MD among his mentors and emphasized how thankful he is to be in an environment with an abundance of selfless colleagues. \"Dr. Schulman is a generational talent in the area of Hemostasis and Thrombosis,\" said Flaumenhaft. \"His enthusiasm for science is contagious and he is attracting young investigators into our field. It is heartening to know that someone with Sol's talent and thoughtful personability is carrying on the important tradition of mentorship in the area of blood clotting and bleeding.\" Schulman can quickly point to the impact the NIH award makes. \"The most exciting thing about the award is the opportunity to explore more ideas, to not have to put some things away for a year,\" he said. \"This allows me to build a bigger team and explore more of my ideas over the short term, as well as build towards more long-term projects.\" \" I am much mor e interested in finding something that is really different and totally unexpected.\"\u2014Sol Schulman, MD, PhD 28 / BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 2930 / BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual ReportDr. Steven Freedman describes the process of moving from a mentored research award toward independent grants as akin to swimming through shark-infested waters. Luckily for young investigators and physician-scientists at BIDMC, Freedman and Dr. Grace Huang have assembled a mentorship and career development submarine to navigate rough seas. \"At some places, a career in research means that you're on your own and your lab is siloed. We want to do the opposite,\" Freedman explains. \"We want to nurture you as much as possible.\" Career development and successful grant funding go hand in hand. Freedman emphasized why working with Huang has not only been impactful on his goals for grant funding, but also in making rising stars in the Department successful.\"Such collaboration rarely happens anywhere else, he notes. \"This really makes us unique.\" Both Freedman and Huang's impressive credentials make them uniquely qualified to guide younger colleagues through the process of advancing their academic and research careers. Freedman is the Chief of the Division of Translational Research within the Department of Medicine, as well as a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS). He also directs BIDMC's Pancreas Center and is a worldwide leading expert in pancreatic diseases and Cystic Fibrosis. Huang is a hospitalist by training and an Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS. After completing her residency in internal medicine at BIDMC, she went on to participate in both the Rabkin Fellowship in Medical Education at BIDMC and the Academy Fellowship in Medical Education at HMS. She now serves as Vice Chair for Career Development and Mentoring in the Department of Medicine, Director of Academic Careers and Faculty Development, Director of the Rabkin Fellowship in Medical Education, and Co-Director of the Academy at BIDMC. Their partnership between research mentorship and overall career advancement led to the development of a three-pronged approach to Exceptio nal Mentorship and Career De velop ment, Supportin g Cutting-Edge Research Through both the Frank lin Epstein Society an d Harvard Catalyst's Grant Review and Support Program (G RASP), the Departmen t of Medicine helps young physicians and invest igators launch illus trious careers. Steve n Freedman, MD, PhD, and Grace Huang, MD, explain how they are leading the way. mentoring faculty: the Franklin Epstein Society, Harvard Catalyst's GRASP program, and career development services within the Department. Franklin Epstein Society Co-founded by Mark Zeidel, MD, Chair of the Department of Medicine and led by Freedman, the Epstein Society supports researchers from residency through their mid-career stages. The Society's monthly meetings are well attended, by junior faculty as well as established senior faculty who stay involved and use their own experiences to provide support and mentorship. One of the primary goals of the Epstein Society is to assist investigators in obtaining a K-Grant from the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH).These Mentored ResearchScientist Career DevelopmentAwards are an early step on\" The Franklin Epstein Society has been a tr emendous venue to connect with peers, network about research and career development goals, and gain new friends.\" \u2014 Vaishali Moulton, MD, PhD BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 3132 / BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 33the road to a career in clinical or translational research. Traditionally, approximately 20% of applicants for a K-Grant receive the award. As Vaishali Moulton, MD, PhD, explains, the Epstein Society is an important resource for any young researcher. \"The Franklin Epstein Society has been a tremendous venue to connect with peers, network about research and career development goals, and gain new friends,\" she says. \"It's a great way to engage with people across divisions, learn about their research, and help one another with ideas, potential research collaborations, and other opportunities. Steve and Grace are amazing mentors. They have created an incredibly energized platform.\" The energy of that platform continues beyond the length of a K-Grant. Senior investigators seeking their first independent research award can transition from the Epstein Society into Harvard Catalyst's GRASP program, also led by Freedman. GRASP Freedman developed GRASP out of a desire to help colleagues grasp the next stage of their careers. A large divide exists between the 20% of applicants who receive a K-Grant and the approximately8% of applicants (only .1% ontheir first attempt) who receivea Research Project Grant (RO1). R01s are the NIH's original grant mechanism, meant to fund specific projects for independent investigators. In the GRASP program, however, the K to RO1 divide is almost nonexistent. Twenty percent of GRASP applicants receive grants on their first attempt (Moulton is among those who made the successful transition.) The program has the grant application process down to a science.GRASP relies on three distinct steps to best prepare investigators' submission materials. First, Freedman leads a three-day workshop\u2014 a bootcamp of sorts for mid-careers scientists. Then, they begin to shape their applications according to an Elements of Grant Writing guide created by Freedman and other HMS colleagues. Lastly, colleagues use month-by-month work plans over a five-year K-Grant. As he explains their purpose, Freedman once again turns to metaphor. \"If I asked you to build me a lunar command module, you probably couldn't do it,\" Freedman says. \"But if I said, every month: 'put this screw here and next month you'll add another piece over there,' the module would come together.\" With the work plans, GRASP has taken apart the mad dash of preparing a grant application and broken it down into methodical, manageable steps. Then, Huang and Freedman collaborate to optimize investigators' curriculum vitae (CVs). Career Development and Mentoring Freedman explains that grant applications essentially come down to a simple question: are you a productive investigator? Publications and prior funding demonstrate that investigators have a strong track record of accomplishment. However, other factors contribute to grant success as well - the reputation of the mentor and co-investigators, invited presentations, and evidence that the investigator has built on opportunities to innovate and lead. Recognition of one's unique contribution to science through talks, funding, awards, and scholarship is the foundation of promotion at HMS, which is important for professional growth. However, Huang prefers to conceptualize career development as more than achieving the next academic rank. \"When meeting with investigators and other faculty in the department, I like to focus more broadly on what leads to professional vitality, whose pillars are mentorship, reputation, leadership, and skill-building,\" she says. Huang conducts 1:1 CV consultations with faculty in the Department of Medicine, which not only helps them prepare for promotion at HMS but also allows them to identify short- and long-term goals. Looking down the list of active K Grants in the Department, it immediately becomes clear that Freedman's and Huang's support is a key step along the way for nearly every scientist at BIDMC.

Your joint analysis seems to have led to a significant with market impact as after releasing an analysis that prices needed to come down by 80%, they were quickly reduced by 60%. What do you think made the difference in this instance? David Rind: ICER had been heavily involved in the PSCK9 space for a while, as had Dr. Kazi, and their drugs were clearly overpriced to the point that no one was using them. As new data emerged, there was a combination of the manufacturers' recognition they had charged too much and needed to lower the price and an uncertainty about where the price should go. Value-based pricing in this rare circumstance was appealing to the manufacturer because it gave them a place to put the price. There was a win/win for manufacturer and payor. In addition, a pricing war drove down the price. Dhruv Kazi: I like your use of 'rare circumstance.' It was a perfect storm with pressure from ICER and academic groups providing strong evidence the drug was overpriced, while patients and payors were voting with their feet. Prescriptions were either not getting approved or patients would show up to the pharmacy saying, 'Wait, how much do you want me to pay for this?' before leaving without their medication. I think the combination of market forces led to the price decrease, with ICER providing some direction for how low the price needed to go. The experience was illustrative that prices can come down in the right set of circumstances. What areas should cost-effective analyses focus on in the future? DK: Cost-effectiveness analyses have, for the most part, focused on the total cost of new therapies, but as drug prices skyrocket, so have the copayments patients are responsible for. Copayments are distorting the market in perverse ways, frequently putting new therapies out of reach for even insured patients. As a society, we've created a lot of incentives for developing new drugs, but once those drugs are on the market, consumers can't always afford them. Our analyses need to pay attention to both total costs and out-of-pocket payments because the two don't always travel together. Our patients should not be asking, 'can I really afford this drug for the next 10 years?' Those conversations should be happening at a societal level\u2014What kind of innovation and access do we value and do our current frameworks reflect these priorities? DR: This has been a problem in oncology, to the point of talking about drugs' \"financial toxicity.\" This means instead of talking about the toxicity of Cutting-Edge Conversations On most Thursday mornings, the Department of Medicine can be found in Sherman Auditorium gathering for Medic al Grand Rounds, as speakers from BIDMC, Harvard Medical School, and other esteemed institutions share their expertise on a range of timely and clinically important topics. This year, a clear intersection of thought emerged in two lectures. David Rind, MD, the Chief Medical Officer of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) spoke on \"Medical Value Assessment in the United States,\" diving into the complex model of value in healthcare . Additionally, Dhruv Kazi, MD, Director of the Cardiac Critical Care Unit at BIDMC, shared a high-level window into the world of drug costs entitled \"Breakthrough Innovation without Breaking the Bank .\" We sat down with them to discuss the challenges of drug pricing and healthcare economics.chemotherapy side effects, we're talking about the toxicity of prices. We routinely hear stories of patients with cancer forgoing treatment because they don't want to bankrupt their families. It's very notable what happened with PCSK9, as a preventative drug. We know patients are hesitant to take preventive treatments already, so when you give them financial toxicity, they just won't take the drug. DK: Now more than ever, we need to reflect on what our stark healthcare disparities say about the system we've created. We've got to push back against lazy arguments suggesting that regulating drug prices would harm innovation and explore more nuanced incentive mechanisms that support innovation but ensure access. Drug pricing isn't just an economics issue, it's a public health issue. Prohibitively high out of pocket costs make no clinical, economic, or ethical sense to me, and yet they're pervasive in our system. DR: It's one thing to use out of pocket costs when you have seven ace inhibitors, the insurer has negotiated a great price on one of them, and a patient likes the ad for a specific one that you make them pay more for. That's very different from, 'This is the only drug you can take, yet we're going to make you pay 6,000 dollars to get it.' It's not clear why this would happen. If almost 100% of our increased spending on brand name drugs comes from year-on-year increases that cannot be justified, is there anything within the power of providers and patients to combat these increases? DK: A big chunk of our annual increase in spending comes from year-on-year price increases on the exact same molecule, which is the manufacturer saying 'we know you're on this drug and it's working for you, so we're going to charge you 10% more.' Rheumatological anti-inflammatory drugs have had particularly egregious increases in recent years, amounting to more than a doubling of the cost of each drug over a decade. DR: And ICER did a study where you look at MS drugs, and all the drugs are overpriced, but if you looked 4-5 years back, they're all fairly priced. You both mentioned a l ack of oversight and organization on the drug pricing. In a perfect world, where would you hope to see that oversight come from? Which would be more effective: a governmental or independent body? DR: I obviously have a conflict of interest in a way and have to say, part of what attracted me to ICER was they are a non-governmental body. I personally think that governmental bodies can end up in their own odd conflicts of interest. ICER can say what a fair price is, and we'll talk about budget impact, but there's no reason for us to say the evidence isn't very good when it is. DK: I think ICER is doing a fantastic job. I do think they're meeting a key societal need, at a time when we don't appear to have the political will to make this happen in an organized way. ICER provides the information but relies on other stakeholders to act on this information to influence prices. Since our federal and state governments are the largest purchasers of drugs, it would seem natural for them to be involved in negotiating prices. Dr. Rind, you remarked that drug companies have teams of smart people designed to make pricing decisions, but they're tasked with making sure their in-house analysis justifies the cost they're going to charge, not vice versa. What power can ICER and academic groups exert in creating change? DR: This is why we conduct our own analyses. We often analyze and think 'how did they come to that decision or make that claim?' and the answer is, \"because it got them just to the price they wanted.\" We wouldn't make those same assumptions. Governmental payors also have economic incentives. They don't want to assume a drug that breaks the budget will work. DK: I've heard folks argue that high drug prices in the US are the result of a broken system. I disagree. I think high drug prices reflect that our system is working exactly as intended. We value innovation and want to reward it, but we've lost sight of what represents meaningful innovation. We can argue about pricing and out-of-pocket costs but we need to go back to first principles and think about what want from our health system in terms of innovation and access. I think the PCSK9i experience has shown that patients and payors are becoming increasingly sensitive to drug prices, and we may finally have an opportunity for structural change. The onus will be on us to maintain this momentum, to have the tough conversations about how to best modify our system to reflect our societal priorities and to advocate for the political reform needed at federal and state levels to ensure equitable access to effective therapies. 34 / BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 35 Dhruv Kazi, MD David Rind, MDMedical Education Leadership 2018-2019 Academic Year Vice Chairs VICE CHAIR FOR EDUCATION Eileen Reynolds, MD ASSOCIATE VICE CHAIRS FOR EDUCATION C.

Joanne Casella, MS, served the medical center and New England Deaconess Hospital for 52 years. For 20 of those years, she was the administrative leader of the Department, which she ran with consummate diplomatic skill, a keen business sense, and a quiet, passionate devotion to our patient care, teaching, and research missions. Raised in the Back Bay, Joanne attended the Boston public schools and began her career as a Northeastern University co-op student in the Deaconess clinical pathology laboratory, transitioning to part-time work as a medical technologist on the evening shift for five years when her daughter was young. A gifted technologist and manager, Joanne worked her way up from Chief Medical Technologist to Vice President of the Pathology Department before moving to the Department of Medicine in 1993. She was one of the first women to hold a departmental leadership role at the medical center. She guided the Department steadily and effectively through the tenures of Drs. Robert Glickman, Robert Moellering, and Mark Zeidel as Chairs. She developed a superb team of division administrators, many of whom went on to major leadership roles within the institution. Her colleagues remember her sound judgement and integrity, and knew that at all times she put our mission first.In Memoriam 44 / BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report BIDMC Department of Medicine 2019 Annual Report / 45Department of Medicine Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA 02215 617-667-7000 Follow us on Twitter @BIDMC_Medicine Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center is a patient care, teaching, and research affiliate of Harvard Medical School and consistently ranks as a national leader among independent hospitals in National Institutes of Health funding.
