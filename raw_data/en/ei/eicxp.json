There is evidence that Hispanics tend to be less successful than non -Hispanic whites in standard weight -loss interventions. This study assessed the feasibility of a culturally -tailored behavioral weight -loss intervention specifically designed for Spanish -speaking women of Mexican origin. Methods - The intervention was based on approaches previously used successfully with English - speaking participants in the PREMIER and Weight Loss Maintenance trials. Cultural adaptations were implemented throughout the program based on information derived from focus groups, available literature, and a multidisciplinary team that included Mexican experts in behavioral interventions and nutritional anthropology. The intervention was conducte d entirely in Spanish. Results : Recruitment was much more successful than expected. Planned sample size was 30 participants, but 47 were enrolled in the study. Thirty -one participants completed the intervention and had main outcome data available. Particip ants did not complete the intervention because they became pregnant (2), had unexpected changes in school schedules (2), relocated to Mexico due to immigration problems (3), needed to follow agricultural work (6), unknown reasons (3). After 6 months, avera ge weight decreased by 7.26 kg (16 lb), p< .0001. Conclusions Mexican -American women have previously been underrepresented in weight -loss interventions; however, this study suggests that culturally -congruent recruitment methods can successfully attract thi s population to lifestyle intervention programs, and that carefully -tailored culturally adapted weight -loss interventions are feasible and potentially effective Objective: Understand the need for culturally adapting weight loss programs in order for succe ss. Presentation Type: Oral (10 - 15 minutes) A-V Needs: None indicated Name: Tia Kauffman Degrees: MPH Title: Project Manager III Organization/Affiliation: Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research Address: 3800 N Voces (Our Voices) Author: Vanessa F. La Torre and Dayna Morrison, MPH Abstract: Latinos continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV, averaging a diagnosis rate 3 times greater than non -Latino Whites. Various social determinants influence Latino health, such as poverty, lack of education, and access to services that are bicultura l and bilingual. Latinos are a socio -demographically diverse community consisting of varying family structures, degrees of acculturation, immigration histories, values and beliefs. Traditionally, the Latino family is close -knit and is considered the single most important social unit. These strong social and cultural influences act as a protective element against external health factors, however, also promote isolation and stigmatization \u00bf especially amongst HIV positive Latino men and women. Nuestras Voces is a group focused on building social connections and empowering for Latina women living with or affected by HIV. This monthly group offers Latina women the opportunity to come together in a safe, confidential space where they can build community, laugh, a nd learn new skills. Nuestras Voces is facilitated by bicultural and bilingual women, and promotes healthier self -perceptions of identity as related to HIV/AIDS. Objective: -Participants will learn how the Latino culture fosters both isolation and resilie ncy amongst seropositive Latina women. -Participants will learn a new approach to providing support to HIV positive Latina women -Participants will learn about family relations in the Latino community, and how to have developmentally appropriate discussion s about HIV and healthy sexuality with families.

Because acculturation to an American lifestyle can be associated with unhealthy behaviors, Latinas are an important target for preconception health messaging. To pro mote awareness of preconception health behaviors, the Oregon Health Authority ran a social marketing campaign targeting Latinas. Planning and implementation of a preconception health social marketing campaign included formative research, concept and strate gy 4 development, and creation of materials and appropriate messages for young Latinas and their families. The campaign Amor y Salud (Love and Health) consisted of a 12 -week radionovela, a Facebook page, and several websites. The radionovela told the stor y of a young woman and her fianc\u00e9 while weaving in preconception health messages. Evaluation of the campaign consisted of surveys available via social media websites and an intercept survey in a target community. Results indicated the campaign raised aware ness about preconception health. The majority of respondents to the web survey stated the campaign provided them with new information and they had spoken to their friends/family about Amor y Salud. The campaign was popular, and promoted information sharing among the target audience about preconception health messages. Objective: 1. The participant will be able to describe the process involved in developing a radionovela . 2. The participant will identify the preconception health issues for Latinas. 3. The pa rticipant will be able to discuss the challenges and strengths in evaluating a social marketing campaign for Latinas.

The role of state and local Public Health departments will also change and evolve. Health Departments preparing for Accreditation will adopt strategies n ow to meet expected future requirements. This will require trial and error, flexibility, and a willingness to adopt and possibly abandon numerous approaches. The extent to which an organization is willing and able to do this may determine its level and speed of success. Project Management requires self -examination and a willingness to adopt what works, in favor of what doesn 't. These project management methods can begin the process of becoming a learning organization. Two local health departments developed similar project management strategies in response to the Triennial Review process. This presentation will highlight lessons learned and implications for using such strategies to prepare for accreditation. A visual demonstration will show how to adapt or adopt strategies and create tools. Each department closed out most findings before the 5 State 's final report to the respective county commissioners. All findings were closed out within the State 's mandated timelines. These same strategies and tools can be use d to assist local health departments prepare for national accreditation. Objective: Develop an understanding of project management strategies and how to use them to streamline site review follow -up and accreditation preparation.

Author: Lydia Emer, Jenn ifer Eskridge, and Laura Spaulding Abstract: Public health accreditation is designed to improve and protect the health of every community by advancing the quality and performance of public health departments. In September 2011, the Public Health Accredita tion Board (PHAB) launched a national, voluntary accreditation program for state, local, territorial and tribal public health departments. For a public health department to be accredited, it must meet stringent requirements listed within 11 Domains (admini strative capacity and the 10 Essential Services of Public Health) while demonstrating a commitment to continuous improvement. Under PHAB's requirements, Local Public Health Authorities must also have, at a minimum, a Department or Organization Strategic Pl an, Community Health Assessment, and Community Health Improvement Plan. The Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division's Performance Management Program (PMP) has CDC funding to provide tools and capacity building assistance to support accreditation rea diness activities at state, county, and tribal levels. By building a culture of quality improvement, the PMP is working with partners to advocate for public health's role in health reform and support the concept of Health in All'. This panel presentation will provide an overview of PHAB's accreditation requirements and highlight the experiences and perspectives of Oregon health departments preparing to apply for accreditation. Objective: Be a ble to describe the Public Health Accreditation Board's accredit ation requirements. Be able to describe accreditation readiness activities happening across the state. Receive information and resources on public health accreditation.

Tobacco use, physical inactivity, low fruit and vegetable consumption, and overweight or obesity are the biggest chronic disease risk factors; a startling 90% of Oregon adults have one or more of these risk factors. Through collaborations that advance policies, environments and systems to promote health and effective self - manageme nt, all people in Oregon can live, work, play, and learn in communities that support health and an optimal quality of life. This session will explore the theme of cross -setting partnerships for chronic disease prevention emerging within recent federal fund ing opportunities, and describe a local clinic -community collaboration that reflects this trend by creating a health neighborhood' while focusing on chronic disease self - management. Methods: After a brief presentation on overarching themes regarding fundi ng trends, an informal living room' style panel discussion will highlight the Community Health Center Patient Self Management Collaborative from three perspectives in Benton County. This initiative takes an integrative cross -disease approach and demonstra tes collaboration across multiple settings. Results/Implications: Panelists will discuss the project's process and outcomes to date, including new clinic protocols and enhanced systems and supports for self -management of chronic disease within the communit y. Panelists will also discuss implications for the county's future ability to address winnable battles' related to chronic disease. 7 Objective: 1. Identify opportunities for public health/community collaborations in support of chronic disease self -manage ment. 2. Outline trends in funding for chronic disease prevention initiatives that cross traditional boundaries of diagnosis, setting and delivery system. 3. Describe the advantages and challenges of partnering across settings to address chronic disease a s a community responsibility. Presentation Type: Oral Presentation A-V Needs: We anticipate a brief video as part of the presentation, and request speakers. We also would like to propose an informal living room' style discussion (if possible) with comfy chairs and a prop or two (table, flowers? We're happy to work with you on this ) rather than a formal panel for this session. This would require four lavaliere microphones or cordless mics.

Omayma Alshaarawy and R. Turner Goins Abstract: Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the association between self-reported diabetes and physical functioning in a population of American Indians aged 55 years and older. Background: Recent population -based studies in older adults suggest diabetes may be linked to reduced physical function. American Indian elders suffer higher rates of bo th diabetes and physical disability. However, research regarding the association between diabetes and physical function in American Indians remains sparse, and few studies have assessed this relationship using performance -based measures of mobility and low er limb function. Methods: Participants were drawn from a cross -sectional, community -based study of an American Indian tribe (N=383 adults aged 55 and older). Participants completed a comprehensive health assessment; physical function was assessed using th e Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), and evaluated as both a continuous and dichotomous variable, with poor lower limb function defined as a total SPPB score of \u00bf8. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent relation of self -reported physician diagnosis of diabetes to lower limb function, and to assess the influence of potential confounding by demographic, lifestyle, and health -related factors. Results: In this population, 44% of participants tested in the poor physical functi oning range, and 42% had received a diagnosis of diabetes. Participants with poor physical functioning were more likely to 8 report diabetes (OR=1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 -2.6), as well as to be older, unmarried, more poorly educated, and female, to have a history of joint/bone trauma, and to suffer pain, sleep deficits, visual impairment, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and depression. In multivariate models adjusting for these and other factors, including BMI and lifestyle characteristics, diabetes remained significantly and inversely associated with SPPB score (p=0.03); relative to nondiabetic participants, those reporting diabetes were approximately twice as likely to show poor lower limb functioning (adjusted OR for SPPB -8=1.9, 95% CI 1.1 -3.3). Likewise, diabetes showed a significant, inverse relation to the gait function (p= 0.03) and balance (p=0.05) components of the SPPB, and a marginally significant inverse association with the chair stand component (p=0.09) after adjustment for demog raphic and other factors. Further adjustment for income and for additional comorbidities did not appreciably alter these associations. Conclusions: Self -reported diabetes was strongly and independently associated with poor physical functioning in this popu lation of older American Indians. Larger, prospective studies are needed to further investigate this association, and to assess causal relationships. Objective: To describe published data regarding the prevalence of diabetes and physical functioning diffi culties in community -dwelling older American Indians. To summarize the current research literature regarding physical functioning in older American Indians. To discuss the unadjusted and adjusted statistical associations between diabetes and objective meas ures of physical functioning.

Rosenberg Abstract: Introduction: An individual's level of education is positively associated with their reading proficiency as a child. Education is also an important predictor for most health outcomes, with higher education indicating better outcomes. Reading to children can effectively improve their reading capability, improving their odds of h igher education. This study examines the association between reading to a child everyday and maternal race/ethnicity adjusting for other factors. Methods: PRAMS is a survey of a stratified random sample of Oregon women drawn from birth certificates. PRAMS -2 is a re-interview of PRAMS respondents. We studied women whose babies were born in 2005 -2005 and reinterviewed in 2006 -2008. Weighted response rate was 56.7%. We used multivariate logistic regression. Results: Maternal race/ethnicity was associated with whether a child was read to every day. The mothers most likely to report that an adult read to their child every day were non -Hispanic white (weighted 71.6%) followed by non -Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander followed by non -Hispanic American Native (53.9%) followed by non -Hispanic black (38.8%) followed by Hispanic (34.1%). After adjusting for maternal age, education and income, NH white women were 3.05 times more likely than NH Black women to read to their children every day. Discussion : There are significant racial/ethnic disparities in adults reading to children. Interventions to increase adults reading to children, especially in black and Hispanic communities, could lead to improved early learning and other educational outcomes. Objec tive: Learn what a longitudinal study is. Learn about the importance of adults reading to toddlers Learn about possible interventions that could improve educational outcomes for children.

Bean, M.P.H. and Joseph Catania, Ph.D Abstract: Context: Vaccines are a crucial public health achievement. However, in Oregon exemptions for el ementary school -aged children have risen and outbreaks of pertussis and measles periodically occur. Health care providers (HCP) influence parental vaccine decisions. . Objective: Using a qualitative methods approach, we examined key beliefs related to HCP recommendations on pediatric vaccination (i.e., perceived vaccine efficacy, benefits, and risks). Design: Semi -structured interviews were conducted with 15 HCPS [traditional (physicians and nurses) and nontraditional (chiropractors and midwives)]. Qualitat ive data analysis was conducted. Results: HCPs occupy a range of positions from full vaccine support to full opposition. Providers in opposition to vaccines held strong beliefs regarding the risks of vaccines. Providers who gave more conditional support to vaccines saw some vaccines as highly efficacious and the diseases they prevent as extremely serious. However, these providers did not support vaccines of unproven efficacy or when they believed that the disease was not serious; therefore, any risks are no t outweighed by related efficacy/benefits. Practitioners who strongly supported vaccines saw them as generally efficacious, posing little risk, and creating much benefit. Conclusion: The present work showed that perceptions of vaccine efficacy, risks, and benefits influence pediatric vaccine recommendations. The findings suggest a number of pathways for intervention to modify incorrect beliefs and reduce negative attitudes regarding vaccines. Objective: Learning Objective: Participants will gain an awarene ss of the spectrum of support for and opposition to pediatric vaccination among health care providers in Oregon.

Young workers are at a higher risk of injury than older workers due to many factors including their lack of experience on the job, tra ining, proper supervision, and a lack of physical or cognitive maturity. A panel of occupational and public health professionals will explore various projects aimed at identifying the peculiar hazards faced by young workers on the job, and developing targe ted educational interventions to mitigate them. Topics will include young worker injury surveillance in Oregon, the activities of the O [yes] (Oregon young employee safety) coalition, occupational safety and health in high school settings and in the agricu ltural industry, and a young workers\u00b4 focus group exploring attitudes on workplace safety and health. The presentations set the context for a discussion of how to further disseminate this work within the wider employer, education, youth and labor communiti es. Objective: To understand: 1. The significance of young worker injuries as a public health concern. 2. State -wide efforts to prevent young worker injuries and fatalities. 3. Occupational safety education for Oregon teens with high school curriculum. 4. Agricultural worker health and safety training for youth. 5. The experience of a group of youth at work and what they think about health and safety.

This descriptive pilot study examined the relative importance of empirical evidence among Oregon legislators during their consideration of House Bill 2726, Oregon's 2009 menu -labeling law. Methods: Oregon legislators completed Internet - and paper -based surveys from August to November 2010. The total population surveyed was 86 legislators and included 58 members from the Oregon House of Representatives and 28 members from the Oregon Senate. A series of soft touches' w ere used to increase the response rate. Results: This study achieved a 55% response rate (n 12 = 47). Data were analyzed across three variables useful to health policy professionals: political party, vote, and chamber. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the m ost common reason for voting in favor of H.B. 2726 was consumers' right to know, and the second most common reason was that empirical evidence suggests menu labeling decreases community obesity levels. Democrats voted against H.B. 2726 because of insuffici ent empirical evidence, cost, or inadequately ambitious legislation. Republicans voted against H.B. 2726 because of beliefs that the government should influence neither individuals' food choices nor restaurant owners' operations. Objective: To understand the factors and sources of empirical evidence legislators consider when deciding how to vote on public health policies Presentation Type: Oral (10 - 15 minutes) or Poster A-V Needs: None indicated Name: Sami Jarrah Degrees: MPH Title: Strategy & Policy Analysis Manager Organization/Affiliation: Multnomah County Health Department Address: 426 SW Start Street, 9th Floor Portland OR Phone: 503.988.3663, x24189 Email1: sami.jarrah@multco.us Student: No Topic: I while working for Congress on my APHA fellowship Title: Stories from Capitol Hill Author: Craig Mosbaek, MPH Abstract: Craig Mosbaek was awarded the 2010 Public Health Fellowship in Government from the American Public Health Association.

Author: Craig Mosbaek, MPH , Aisling Fernandez and Janne Boone -Heinonen, PhD Abstract: Background : Policies to reduce tobacco use, improve nutrition, and increase physical activity have the potential to enhance population health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Lack of information about how policy makers and their staffs view tobacco and obesity i ssues hinders effective advocacy efforts to pass health -promoting legislation. We address this critical knowledge gap through a survey of Oregon legislative staff, key players in the policy arena. Methods : Oregon legislative staff were recruited to partici pate in the study prior to the end of the 2011 legislative session. All 90 legislative offices were contacted (60 House and 30 Senate), with four offices refusing to participate. In each office, the staff person most responsible for health policy issues wa s recruited to do the survey. Survey interviews will be conducted between mid - July and the end of August. The survey collects staff perceptions and opinions about the importance of tobacco use and obesity as health issues, awareness and views of local and national public health groups, and persuasiveness of various messaging approaches. Results : The results of this study will be available in September, 2011. Conclusions : Study findings will inform recommendations for how public health advocates can communic ate better with legislative staff. Objective: Attendees will learn how Oregon legislative staff obtain information on public health issues. Attendees will learn how to better communicate with legislative staff.

From January 1, 1984 through October 22, 2010 seven outbreaks were associated with fraternities and sororities with 85.7% (6/7) of the outbreaks involving fraternities. Since 2008 five of those outbreaks have been asso ciated with fraternities. Both the number of reported outbreaks and the frequency of outbreaks associated with fraternities are increasing. Historically both fraternities and sororities requested voluntary food safety inspections from at least 1984, the earliest records that I have been able to compile. Fraternities began opting out of voluntary contract inspections in June 2004 with the dissolution of their Management Coop. In 2004, 90% (18/20) of the fraternities chose not to do voluntary contract ins pections returning briefly in 2009. A cost -benefit analysis was performed comparing costs associated with these outbreaks and the cost of inspection. Concurrent Session #2 Topic: Aging and the Environment Title: Community engAGEment for Age -Friendly E nvironments Author: Deborah H. John, PhD Abstract: People across the U.S. and Oregon are aging, which may burden the current individual, family, and community resources. Accessibility, availability, and affordability of place -based resources affects the ability of residents, as they grow older, to continue to live and thrive in their loca l community. engAGE in Community is a community - campus partnership with a goal to establish Clackamas County as an age -friendly place where adults can age actively and successfully in their residence and community of choice. The purpose of this community -based participatory action research (CPAR) project was to partner with local people within local communities to identifying attributes of the physical, social, and service environments, defined according to the World Health Organization 's model of age -frien dly communities, that support or hinder the ability of all residents to age in place. For this study we applied a CPAR model and MAPPS (Mapping Attributes using Participatory Photographic Surveys) technology with an initial focus on identifying environment al attributes across rural communities (n=3) related to age -friendly topic areas as experienced by local residents. Our approach 15 focused on involving all relevant community stakeholders to build capacity for action, followed by participatory processes invo lving photography, GIS mapping, photo elucidation, consensus building, and planning to facilitate community change. Results of this pilot program will be discussed relative to differences between survey data of Clackamas County people 's (n=397) perceptions of and importance of community resources that support healthy aging and community livability and the documented community features. Objective: 1. Learn of a new technology for community engagement around issues of health and place 2. Explore the communit y attributes that influence rural people 's experience of their local physical, social, and service environments as either supporting or hindering place -based aging.

Methods: This study utilized Metro 's RLIS data to establish high -resolution, objective built -environment measures in Portland. Transit, commercial, and park areas access; intersection and population density were measured using GIS. Cluster analysis was then conducted to identify urban forms sharing similar built -environme nt characteristics. Logistic regression was performed on a sample of older women from the Study of Osteoporotic Fracture (n=2,005), linked with spatial information, to investigate the associations between urban forms and walking. Results: The adjusted mode ls suggested older women in city periphery, suburb, urban fringe with poor commercial access were significantly less likely to walk than those in city center. However, no difference in walking was observed for urban fringe with poor park access or satellit e city as compared to central city. Conclusions: A compact environment may promote walking. The creation of small standardized geographic units in conjunction with cluster analysis to classify neighborhoods redefines the built - environment without use of ad ministrative boundaries and accounts for mixed effects from multiple attributes. This method may be applicable to similar studies, and the 16 results can inform planning decisions. Objective: Increase understanding of: -a method for quantifying and assessing the built environment without use of administrative boundaries. -the observed differences in built environment and walking Presentation Type: Oral (10 - 15 minutes) A-V Needs: None indicated Name: Vivian Siu Degrees: MPH Built Environment Title: Community Design Indicators for Environmental Public Health Tracking in Oregon Author: Dan Rubado Abstract: Background: Reversing the epidemic of obesity in the US will require a wide range of strategies. The form of our community environments has substantial influence on physical activity and diet. We need to change the shape of our towns and cities to promote healthier lifestyles and stem obesity. To address com munity design issues related to public health, we need to carefully assess community environmental features so we know where and how to make improvements. However, it can be relatively difficult to find consistent, reliable, local scale data for community assessment. Methods: To facilitate community assessment, Oregon EPHT is adopting a set of community design indicators to make consistent, reliable, local scale data publicly available. We have solicited input from a number of partners including our state H ealthy Communities program, local health and planning departments, Portland State University, WA EPHT, WA Chronic Disease Prevention and our technical advisory group. Results: The resulting set of indicators covers a number of community design topic areas related to public health. These include the food environment, walkability, bike -ability, access to public recreation spaces, access to public transit, housing affordability, alcohol and tobacco availability and public safety. Objective: Objective 1: After completing the program, participants will understand the basics of how community design features influence behavior and health. Objective 2: Participants will be familiar with the major community design topic areas related to public health. Objective 3: Pa rticipants will learn how to assess community design features, what types of data can be used and how to calculate specific measures.

Marie Harvey, Viktor Bovbjerg, Donna Champeau, and Tom Eversole Abstract: In June 2011, Oregon State University established Oregon's f irst college of public health, with an innovative interdisciplinary design aimed to address social and behavioral determinants of health, environmental factors and policy considerations, which result in health disparities. OSU's Carnegie designation requi res engaged scholarship, characterized by partnership, mutually beneficial outcomes and reciprocity with community members. This panel discussion will outline and seek input for further development of the CPHHS as a Carnegie Engaged, Land Grant instituti on. The new college's undergraduate and graduate teaching and research programs are designed for knowledge exchange in a transdisciplinary, two -way relationship with practitioners. Applied research, community service and public health practice improvement will be conducted in partnership with OSU's Land Grant Extension service - bringing new partners and resources to the table. The figure -8 OCHO (Outreach Collaborative for Healthy Oregon) model seeks to develop evidence -based solutions to community generate d questions. Workforce development may begin upstream with 4-H projects focused on youth empowerment and health advocacy. Traditional MPH internships will be standardized and strengthened in partnership with preceptors, who could hold courtesy appointm ents as CPHHS faculty at academic health departments, community based organizations and/or private sector business. Objectives: Participants will increase their understanding of: a. academic programs offered at Oregon's first College of Public Health and Human Sciences; b. Outreach Collaboratives for Healthy Oregon (OCHO) for applied research and public heath practice improvement; c. opportunities to participate in service MPH internship / learning programs d: the land grant university mission and th e scope of engaged scholarship; Participants will participate in discussion of ways that Oregon's college of public health can be most relevant to their work Presentation Type: Panel Presentation Panel Abstract 1: Structure and Academic programs at CPHH S - Marie Harvey Composed of two schools, the new college will continue to offer bachelor, master and doctoral degrees in Public Health, Nutrition, Exercise Science, and Human Development and Family Sciences. Accredited as part of the Oregon Master of Publ ic Health (OMPH) Program, OSU offers six separate MPH tracks: Biostatistics; 18 Epidemiology; Environment, Safety & Health; Health Management & Policy; Health Promotion & Health Behavior; and International Health . Faculty from both schools contribute to educa tion in all graduate public health fields. The thorough integration of faculty and students across both schools promotes trans -disciplinary teaching, service and research. Students may take courses in Nutrition, Exercise Sciences, Human Development and Family Sciences within the College. Across campus, students have access to faculty at unique research centers including: the Linus Pauling Institute, Center for Healthy Aging Research, Center for Healthy Children and Families, Institute for Climate Change Research, Center for Oceanographic and Atmospheric Studies (COAS), OSU Environmental Health Sciences Center (EHSC), and the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB.) Starting January 2012, CPHH S will initiate an on -line Graduate Certificate in Public Health designed for working professionals. Dual degree programs are available through the CPHHS and OSU Colleges of Pharmacy and Veterinary Medicine. Panel Abstract 2: OCHO: Outreach Collaborative s for Healthy Oregon - Viktor Bovbjerg OCHO achieves the Public Health Practice Improvement functions of the CPHHS while enhancing the outreach and engagement efforts of county -based Extension Family and Community Health programs. This partnership among ca mpus faculty, extension faculty and local health departments conducts applied community -based research, consultation and technical assistance with communities throughout Oregon. Such activities provide practical, service learning opportunities for MPH stu dents. 4 -H Youth Development provides inroads to early public health career exploration. Engaged scholarship is defined by reciprocal, collaborative relationships with partnerships external to the university. Under the OCHO Model, university faculty reach out to communities and conduct applied research on the questions / needs posed by the community. Along with new knowledge comes translation into best practices and training, which the community helps design, pilot test and improve with faculty consultati on. Best practices addressing the social determinants of health and aimed to reduce health disparities are conducted by community members. Campus faculty help community members evaluate the interventions and also help the community assess changes in its h ealth status. An important facet of this model is that it does not end with new knowledge and published papers. Engaged scholarship requires application for the benefit of communities who initiated the research. Panel Abstract 3: MPH Internships and Service Learning - Donna Champeau MPH internships are required for accreditation and provide practical experience for professional students entering the workforce. OSU's Carnegie designation for Engagement, however, requires that internships also feature s ervice learning. In addition to helping meet community needs, internship students must academically reflect on their work in such a way as to gain further understanding of course content, a broader appreciation of their discipline, and an enhanced sense of personal values and civic responsibility. To achieve those standards, the CPHHS needs commitment of preceptors at county health departments, NGOs, businesses, etc. to establish and sustain strong internship placement opportunities that are mutually benefi cial to students, preceptors and the College. We envision building a statewide system of preceptor sites 19 with ongoing and consistent placements, in which preceptors may hold courtesy faculty appointments. Preceptors will be co -creators and co -learners of new knowledge and co - teachers of public health students along with campus faculty. When operational, focused and sustained community public health internships will allow CPHHS faculty and preceptors to improve the health status of communities. Panelists wi ll solicit participant ideas on best ways to design and support the College internship program.

Intervening during the early years (0 -5 years) may be the best prevention strategy. Child care settings could play a critical role in helping to establish good health habits for life and preventing childh ood obesity. Methods: Oregon Public Health Institute (OPHI) conducted a 58 -question survey assessment on a universal sample of licensed child care settings in Multnomah County (n=492) querying on nutrition, breastfeeding accommodation, physical activity, a nd screen time. The survey was implemented following a modified Dillman Method yielding a 58% response rate. The survey was available in English and Russian language. Findings: This presentation will highlight the most interesting findings from a robust se t of data including: A demographic desc ription of survey respondents, A description of responses in the 4 topic areas by type of child care licensure/setting, and The differences by setting type in specific practices related to nutrition and screen time . Conclusions: Findings support the need for both policy and programmatic changes in the institutions that license, monitor, and support child care providers. Priority recommendations to support obesity prevention in child care will be discussed. Objectiv e: 1) To describe briefly the survey implementation methods 2) To discuss survey findings from the Multnomah County pilot assessment 3) To highlight policy and program recommendations for Oregon based on survey findings and national standards Presentation Type: Oral (10 - 15 minutes) A-V Needs: None indicated Name: Rachel Burdon Degrees: MPH 20 Title: Project Manager Organization/Affiliation: Oregon Public Health Institute Address: 315 SW 5th Avenue Suite 202 Portland OR 97204 Primary Phone: Bellance Topic: Promoting Physical Activity in Home -based Child Care Settings Title: Effect of Family Child Care Home Policies and Practices on Children's Physical Activity: Findings from the Healthy Home Child Care Project Author: Katherine B. Gunter, PhD, Kelly R. Rice, MS and Stewart G. Trost, PhD Abstract: Background: Early childhood settings including Family Child Care Homes (FCCHs) have the potential to influence the lives of millions of U.S. children. However, little is known regarding how FCCH policies and practices influence children 's physical behaviors. Purpose: To determine the relationship between FCCH Providers physical activity (PA) policies and practices and objectively measured PA in 2 -5 year -old children attending FCCHs in Oregon. Methods: Providers from 45 FCCHs in six Oregon counties completed assessments of PA policies and practices (Nutrition and Physical Activity Assessment for Child Care); child BMI and child BA behavior w ere collected on 136 children (mean age=3.7 + 1.2 years). Results: Policies and practices associated with higher levels of PA included provision of sufficient outdoor active play, active play using portable play equipment, the presence of a variety of fixe d play equipment, and suitable indoor play space. Provider practices such as engaging in active play and receiving PA - related training were also associated with higher levels of PA. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first study to identify policies and practices of FCCHs that influence the time children spend in PA. These data should be considered when developing programs and policies to promote PA in FCCHs. Objective: Describe the current physical activity policies and practices of Family Child Care Homes operating in Oregon. Describe the physical activity policies and practices influencing physical activity among children attending Family Child Care Homes participating in the Healthy Home Child Care Project. Describe components of the Journey to a Healthy Child Care Home Program designed to improve physical activity policies and practices and increase children 's physical activity.

Pickett, RN, MSN and Kristen Becker, MS, MPH Abstract: Understanding the relationships among obesity prevention parenting practices, mothers' demographic characteristics, and types of early care and education (ECCE) arrangements may inform successful planning for policy and services that reduce the risk of obesity for children in ECCE settings. We used data from a survey of mothers of 2 -year -old children (Oregon's PRAMS -2 Survey). K -means cluster analysis (using S PSS v. 17.0) was used to group mothers into 3 groups based on breastfeeding duration, poverty level, race, age, marital status, and education. Similarities in cluster distribution by child care type were used to group child care into 2 types, which we called formal and informal care. Respondents who chose other' were included with informal care based on similarities in the cluster analysis. Regression analyses were performed in Stata 11.0. Mothers' obesity prevention parenting practices appear to correlate with their ECCE arrangements. Mothers using formal ECCE arrangements are more likely to initiate breastfeeding and continue for 6 months, give their children less soda and screen time, and have access to health insurance for their children. Less effective obesity prevention parenting practices correlate with the use of informal child care arrangements. These mothers tend to be young maternal age, household income <100% of the federal poverty level, and child with no health insurance, healthcare provider or dental care. Objective: Learn about the obesity prevention parenting practices of mothers of 2 year olds who answered the PRAMS 2 Survey. Understand how parent characteristics and parenting practices relate to obesity prevention practices in ECCE setti ngs.

Using community based participatory research (CBPR) methodology, a community and academic partnership in Jackson County, Oregon was formed to promote improved reproductive health for Latina women and healthier birth outcomes for Latina infants in our community. Year one goals were to 1) Develop and strengthen existing academic and community partnerships committed to promoting improved reproductive health for Latinas in our community; 2) Conduct a secondary analysis of existin g data from previous community assessments to inform current partners regarding factors in Jackson County that impact reproductive health for Latinas; and, 3) Build commitment and capacity for community and academic partners in research methodology. This p resentation will review the lessons learned during the first year of building the partnership to achieve these goals. We will also discuss specific strategies that contributed to building a successful partnership. Objective: 1. Discuss what organizations and members who represent them should be considered when building a CBPR partnership. 2. Describe ways to develop and strengthen a CBPR partnership. 3. Describe methods to build community research capacity.

Main, in Public Health Title: A joint modeling approach to data with informative cluster size: Robustness to the cluster size model Author: Bo Zhang, Zhen Chen and Paul S. Albert Abstract: In biomedical and epidemiological studi es, data are often clustered due to longitudinal follow up or repeated sampling. For example, in developmental toxicity studies, fetuses are clustered within litters; in periodontal studies, teeth are clustered within subjects, and in intrauterine insemina tion studies, menstrual cycles are clustered within women and within sperm donors. While in some clustered data the cluster size is pre-determined, in others it may be correlated with the outcome of subunits, resulting in informative cluster size. One attr active framework for modeling data with informative cluster size is the joint modeling approach in which a common set of random effects are shared by both the outcome and cluster size models. Questions arise as to whether the joint modeling approach is rob ust to misspecification of the cluster size model. In this presentation, we show the study results on both asymptotic and finite -sample characteristics of the maximum likelihood estimators in joint models when the cluster size model is mispecified. We foun d that using an incorrect distribution for the cluster 23 size may induce small to moderate biases, while using a mispecified functional form for the shared random parameter in the cluster size model results in nearly unbiased estimation of outcome model para meters. Objective: To gain experience in analyzing correlated data in public health.

Roldan, MPH Abstract: West Nile virus (WNv), a mosquito -borne disease continues to be a serious threat to public health throughout most of the United States. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is an effectiv e statistical modeling technique for forecasting WNv. Analyses of data from recent studies revealed how changes in meteorological conditions can affect WNv transmission. This study endeavored to develop SARIMA models to forecast larval abundance and explor e the impact of local meteorological conditions on the larval density of three mosquito species known to vector WNv in Multnomah County, Oregon. SARIMA models vexans, and cross -correlation analysi s was performed to evaluate the relationship between local climatic conditions and mosquito larvae density. The SARIMA model (0,1,1)(0,1,1)12 was the best model for Cx. pipiens, while SARIMA model (0,1,0)(0,1,1)12 was the best for Cx. tarsalis based on Roo t Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Akaike 's Information Criterion (AIC). The data did not support a SARIMA model for Ae. vexans that could be validated to adequately forecast larval abundance. Cross -correlation analysis revealed correlations between larvae density and meteorological variables at key lags. Objective: Get familiarized with Seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average (SARIMA) statistical model in predicting diseases. Gain understanding on the impact of regional climate change on the abundance of mosqu ito species known to vector West Nile virus in Oregon.

Author: Kendra Evans, Nancy Glass, Nancy Perrin, Ginger Ha nson, Elliot Hohn, Andrew Kirk and W. Kent Anger. Abstract: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a pervasive problem. The objective of this research is to determine the impact of Domestic Violence and the Workplace training on supervisor knowledge, percep tion, and intention to address IPV in the workplace, using a randomized trial design. Service organizations (100 or fewer employees) were recruited throughout Oregon and training was provided by one of three methods: 1) Computer -based training (CBT) (22 bu sinesses) with interactive quizzes featuring training feedback; 2) Web (17 businesses) received internet -based training (identical content to the CBT) but without interactive quizzes; and 3) Brochure (20 businesses) received an Oregon state domestic violen ce in the workplace brochure (and the CBT at follow -up). All intervention groups showed significant improvement from pre - to post - test, with CBT (pre = 72%, post = 94%) showing greatest improvement, and Web (pre = 71%, post = 83%) showing less. The Brochur e group scored 74% on post -test. Eighty -one percent of all participants reported the training changed motivation to address IPV in the workplace, with the highest percentage (86%) from CBT group and lowest (76%) in the Brochure group. Results suggest that trainings utilizing interactive quizzes with feedback increase knowledge and motivation to address IPV issues in the workplace. Objective: To evaluate the impact of 3 different workplace training formats on knowledge, perception, and motivation to address intimate partner violence in the workplace.

Title: Wellness@Work: How Oregon Universities and State Agencies are Walking the Talk in Pursuit of Wellness Author: Dawn Robbins (moderator), Inge Aldersebaes, Joan Kapowich, Alexa Shook, and Marci M. Torres 25 Abstract: Chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems; they are also some of the most preventable. Tobacco use , physical inactivity, low fruit and vegetable consumption, and overweight or obesity are the biggest risk factors for chronic diseases, and a startling 90% of Oregon adults have one or more of these risk factors, according to BRFSS data. By advancing poli cies, environments and systems that promote health and manage chronic disease, the vision can be achieved for all people in Oregon to live, work, play, and learn in communities that support health and an optimal quality of life. This session will explore d ominant themes underlying recent federal funding opportunities for public health programs and describe successful collaborative projects in Oregon that have reflected these trends, while focusing on Oregon's Wellness@Work initiative. Oregon, like all state s, suffers from an increasing burden of preventable chronic diseases, like heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and cancer, which drive up health care costs. Most Oregon adults want to be healthy and spend nearly half their waking hours at work. This makes w orksites an important venue to encourage healthy behaviors. Learn how Oregon's state agencies and universities are creating environments that will help employees prevent or manage costly chronic conditions by quitting tobacco, moving more, eating better, a nd living healthier lives. Participants will learn why Wellness@Work is important; discover how Oregon worksites use data to drive wellness decisions; and see how partnerships are fueling change in institutions throughout the state. They will discover Well ness@Work, a public -private partnership with tools to improve wellness at worksites of every size and type, and discuss ways they can join the Wellness@Work movement wherever they work. Objective: Participants will learn: The business case for Wellness@W ork: How data support worksite wellness efforts; How partnerships fuel lasting change; New resources they can share Presentation Type: Oral Presentation A-V Needs: N/A Oregon Publi c Health Division Address: 800 NE Oregon Portland 97232 Primary Email1: Dawn.E.robbins@state.or.us Student: No Co-Presenter Kapowich, Administrator, Oregon Public Employees Benefit Board Co-Presenter 2: Alexa Shook, Di rector, Healthy Life Challenge, PacificSource Health Co-Presenter 3: Marci M.

Johnson, MS, Christine M. Meadows, JD, and Carlos J. Richard, MA 26 Abstract: Enhancing organizational diversity is imperative in this era of globalization. The organization should be led and encouraged to maximize all available resources, including the diversity that people bring to the workplace. Maximizing these resources can inc rease retention, the ability to recruit and most very importantly, individual and workforce performance. The efficacy of the programs we develop, the policies we create and the service we provide is no better than the level of competence that exists in the organization. This is holds true as well in terms of cultural competency. This panel discussion will connect the dots on how organizations can think and act more strategically in multicultural organizational development and enhancing organizational divers ity.

Harmful algae blooms in Oregon appear to be on the increase, both in numbers and in counties affected. In 2005 HABS issued six health advisories for water bodies in three Oregon counties; by 2010 the number of advisories issued grew to 22 for water bodies in nine counties. The Oregon Public Health Division's Harmful Algae Bloom Surveillance program, funded through a 5 -year federal grant, is finishing up its third year. The program has greatly improved coordination and communication aspects of advising the public w hen a bloom of toxigenic algae has been detected. 27 Other tasks include entering bloom data and human and animal illness reports into a national data base and outreach and education activities to build awareness among the public and key affected groups. 28 Concurrent Session #3 Topic: Environmental epigenetics Title: Dietary and environmental influences on epigenetics and disease susceptibility Author: Molly Kile, Emily Ho, E. Andreas Houseman and Anna Hsu -Rincon Abstract: Epigenetic phenomena, including h istone modification and DNA methylation, are mechanisms by which dietary, lifestyle, social and environmental factors influence gene expression without changing the underlying genetic sequence. This new knowledge in the epigenetic regulation has caused a p aradigm shift in the way we think about both the etiology and susceptibility to many diseases. It is now widely accepted that epigenetic variation influences disease risk and plays a role in many common complex diseases including cancer. Unlike genetic mut ations, epigenetic alterations are potentially reversible. Therefore, it is important that we understand how dietary and environmental exposures affect the epigenome because it could yield new insights for disease prevention. This panel will describe how d ietary and environmental pollutants influence epigenetic mechanisms, as well as, discuss statistical and methodological challenges for studying epigenetics in human populations. Objective: 1) Examine how dietary factors act as epigenetic modifiers and infl uence cancer risk; 2) Describe how DNA methylation arrays can be used to study leukocyte distribution and related immune response; 3) Discuss how environmental pollutants can modify epigenetic mechanisms in the developing fetus that could influence risk of disease later in life. Presentation Type: Panel Presentation Panel Abstract1: Title: Dietary influences on epigenetics and cancer prevention (Ho, E.) Epigenetic phenomena include, but are not limited to, covalent modifications of histones, methylation of cytosines in DNA, and gene regulation by non -coding RNA. These features are potentially reversible and affect the expression of genes. It has become increasing clear that the epigenome is just as critical as the DNA to healthy human development. Importantl y, dietary factors and specific nutrients can modulate the epigenome and alter susceptibility to disease. The goal of this presentation is to highlight the interactions among nutrients, epigenetics and disease susceptibility. In particular, the reversible acetylation of histones is an important mechanism of gene regulation. During cancer progression, specific modifications in acetylation patterns on histones are apparent. Targeting the epigenome, including the use of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, i s a novel strategy for cancer chemoprevention. We have previously found that sulforaphane (SFN), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, inhibits HDAC activity in human colorectal and prostate cancer cells. The ability of SFN to target aberrant epigene tic patterns may make it an effective chemoprevention agent. The use of dietary epigenetic modulators may aid making recommendations for high - risk prostate cancer patients and thereby increase their survival through simple dietary choices incorporating eas ily accessible foods into their diets. Panel Abstract2: Title: DNA Methylation Arrays as Surrogate Measures of Cell Mixture Distribution (Houseman) Background: There has been a long -standing need in 29 biomedical research for a method that quantifies the comp osition of leukocytes beyond what is possible in a histologic assessment. In a diverse array of diseases, this information will critically inform the underlying immuno -biology as well as the immune response to almost all chronic medical conditions. Though quantifying the composition of white blood cell populations is highly desirable, it has to date not been achieved due to the absence of biologic markers that define leukocyte populations. However, emerging research demonstrates that DNA methylation measure d in whole peripheral blood serves to distinguish cancer cases from controls. Methods: We present a novel method for inferring changes in the distribution of white blood cells between different subpopulations (e.g. cases and controls) using DNA methylation signatures, in combination with a previously obtained external validation set consisting of methylation signatures from purified leukocyte samples. Results: We demonstrate our method on Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) cases and matched contr ols, showing that DNA methylation signatures register known changes in CD4+ and granulocyte populations. Conclusion: Our statistical method, in combination with an appropriate external validation set, promises new opportunities for large -scale immunologica l studies. Panel Abstract3: Title: Low level arsenic exposure is associated with DNA hypermethylation in umbilical cord blood (Kile) Background: Arsenic is a common environmental pollutant and many western states, including Oregon, have elevated concentrat ions of arsenic in groundwater. Individuals who consume contaminated groundwater have a much higher risk of adverse health outcomes including reproductive toxicity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, skin lesions, bladder cancer, liver cancer, and lu ng cancer. The mechanism by which arsenic causes toxicity has been poorly understood although there is growing evidence that arsenic acts as an epigenetic toxicant. Methods: We investigated the effect of arsenic exposure and DNA methylation in white blood cells using data from a prospective birth cohort recruited in Bangladesh. Results: DNA methylation in repetitive elements (LINE -1) and tumor suppressor genes (p16) was significantly higher in infants born to mothers who drank arsenic -contaminated water (> 1 \u00b5g/L) during their pregnancy compared to infants born to mothers whose drinking water contained < 1 \u00b5g/L. These results support the concept that arsenic is an epigenetic toxicant and that in utero exposure exposure to low levels of arsenic were associate d with DNA hypermethylation in umbilical cord leukocytes at both repeated elements and loci specific markers. Conclusions: Umbilical cord leukocytes appeared to be more sensitive to arsenic compared to maternal leukocytes. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results and determine whether changes in DNA methylation of umbilical cord leukocytes persist or are associated with health outcomes as the child ages.

By 2050, 30% of the U.S. population will be of Latino descent. Effective Latino engagement requires building relationships and trust with Latino communities and identifying and sustaining advocates for people, neighborhoods, and issues within communities. The panel discussion will reflect on efforts to engage Latino populations in health promotion activities and health services through soccer programming and the use of Latino lay - health leaders. Both strategies have shown to be an effective means of conducting outreach among low -income Latino communities. Using soccer programming as a framework for outreach can be a culturally and linguistically appropriate approach to engaging La tinos in accessing health services and promoting physical activity. New partnerships among Benton County Public Health, Corvallis Parks and Recreation, and OSU Extension have resulted in the development and implementation of new initiatives in Benton Count y, including:1) \u00a1Campeones de Salud! Soccer Tournament and Family Weekend, which improves awareness and access to health services; 2) Escuelita de F\u00fatbol, an afterschool youth soccer and health promotion program; and 3) Poder Comunitario, modeled after Ben ton County's Voceros de Salud project, focuses on engaging Latino adult and youth to address cultural - and language -specific nutrition education and physical activity. Objective: 1. Outline examples of community -based participatory research methods among L atino populations. 2. Demonstrate the impact of culturally appropriate interventions. 3. Identify two effective outreach strategies for reaching and engaging Latinos. 4. Describe common challenges and opportunities related to engaging Latinos in health pro grams and services.

Concern about pesticide exposure to farmworkers and their families extends from occupational exposures to take -home exposures. Research has demonstrated that occupation and home hygiene practices impact exposure, however, the relationship between acculturation, the alteration of an original culture to fit a dominant one, and behaviors that impact exposure hav e not been examined. Acculturation within the family was examined in 300 families living in an agricultural community, 144 with at least one family member working in agriculture and 156 non -agricultural families. Acculturation scores ranged from 20 to 100. Highest acculturation scores were seen in families working outside of agriculture (mean score = 82), and orchard owners/foremen (mean score = 74). Lowest scores were seen where one family member works in agriculture (mean score = 50) and families with bot h parents working seasonally in the orchard and fruit packing plants (mean score = 41). While further examination of behaviors affecting exposure is needed, acculturation proves to be a good predictor of potential risk of exposure to agricultural pesticide s through occupation. Objective: Define acculturation and the relationship between acculturation and occupational behaviors to reduce pesticide exposure.

A coalition promoting Latino sexual health equity Author: Molly Franks , Vanessa La Torre and Elizabeth Fussell Abstract: Latinos bear a disproportionate burden of chlamydia, HIV, and teen 32 pregnancy, compared to other groups. In 2008, an assessment of existing programs and services in the Portland area showed several programs offered HIV/STI testing and STI - focused education for Latinos. Various educational programs aim to prevent teen pregnancy by promoting abstinence or birth control. However, few address the underlying causes of these problems, including taboos associated with discussing sexuality, sexual orientation or gender roles. In addition to these taboos, which are common across cultures, social determinants such as di scrimination in schools, law enforcement, and employment also contribute to inequities. OYE is a group of community members, organizations, and public health workers who have been collaborating for over two years to offer a new way to approach sexual healt h in Latino communities. We use bilingual popular education -style workshops to promote dialogue about sexuality, sexual health, gender roles and social determinants of health. Providers and community members participating in OYE workshops and community eve nts gain a deeper understanding of how to promote healthy sexuality beginning at birth. We empower people to take a positive approach to sexuality in their own lives, families, workplaces, and communities, and take action around social determinants of heal th. Objective: Participants will: 1. Be familiar with the mission of O.Y.E. and its novel appro ach to sexual health promotion. 2.

It i s however, unique because young people are recruited to be teen activists and the social change agent within a community and school. Satellite teams of teenagers are provided real world opportunities that enable them to challenge perceptions around teen su bstance use and add their unique voice and perspective on susta ining positive community change. The process includes students working alongside a professional evaluation, creative and prevention team that train students in data collection, media literacy, and community outreach. This empowers teens whereby they collect data on PDA's and analyze the results. Teens then initiate and design media messages targeting both teens and adults. 33 The data and messages are presented to community, school and city leaders . The outcomes from this project have not only changed perceptions and attitudes, but also behavior. School reported drug and alcohol use rates have decreased. School infractions for alcohol and drug use have also dropped. Addit ionally, data shows a dramat ic improvement in school climate and communication with teachers and administrators.

Arnold, Ph.D. Abstract: Youth Advocates for Health (YA -4H) is a youth action training curriculum developed by the Oregon 4 -H program. The curriculum engages teens and their adult partners in a community -based participatory action research project that helps youth identify and addres s health -related concerns in their community. The curriculum teaches teens action research skills including: identifying a health related problem in their community that affects youth, conducting background research on the problem, engaging community membe rs in determining solutions for the problem, and taking action to address the problem. The curriculum is entirely activity -based with complete plans for highly interactive and engaging youth participation. Participants in this session will receive an overv iew of the curriculum and learn ways that it can be used in communities to engage teens in public health related community projects. Objective: Participants w ill: 1. Learn about the YA4 -H curriculum and how it can be useful in helping youth address health -related concerns in their community ; 2. Learn about the importance of engaging youth effectively through partnerships with adult mentors ; 3. Learn how to use the cur riculum in public health programs with teens.

Flay, A. Acock, S. Vuchinich, K. Lewis, N. Bavarian, M. Schure, P. Malloy A. Reed, F. Snyder, K. Li, D. DuBois, N. Silverthorne, J. Day, M. Fagen and N. Portillo Abstract: The Positive Action (PA) program is a comprehensive social and character development program that involves teacher training, school -wide climate change, age - appropriate curricula for every grade, and the involvement of counselors and parents. In the Chicago RCT of PA, fourteen low -performing schools from high -poverty, inner -city neighborhoods were randomly assigned from matched pairs to PA or wait -listed control. Two grants allowed us to follow one cohort of students beginning in grade 3 through the end of grade 8. From impact tests across 56 student self -report outcomes, 32 were significant (p .05 level, two - tailed); average absolute effect size for all 56 outcomes was 0.39 (0.26 -0.52), and the average effect size for the 32 significant outcomes w as 0.60 (0.49 -0.70)), arguing strongly against chance findings. To substantiate findings, analyses were also performed on parent self -reports, teacher self -reports, and school - level archival data. Results indicate that the second randomized control trial o f PA replicated findings from the first RCT of Positive Action (i.e. the Hawai'i RCT) regarding substance use and violence, and extended the findings to high -poverty, inner -city schools. The study also extended the findings to other outcomes related to aca demics, behavior, and character and social development. Objective: 1. Understand social and character development programs. 2. Understand the Positive Action program. 3. Learn methodology and findings from the Chicago RCT of Positive Action. Presentation Type: Oral Presentation A-V Name: Brian Flay Public Health Schure State -Whitethorn, MPH Abstract: The HIV Prevention Program uses social networks in six counties to find undiagnosed HIV infections via the Social Network Strategy (SNS). SNS taps into the social networks of individuals at high risk for undiagnosed HIV infection through HIV - positive and h igh-risk HIV -negative recruiters. Through monetary incentives and the currency of personal relationships, recruiters encourage their friends, sex partners, injection -drug sharing partners or anyone in their social networks (known as network associates) who is unaware of their HIV status to test for HIV at a participating health center. Lane County, in particular, had made impressive progress with SNS. Twenty - three recruiters have engaged 65 network associates. Forty -two of the 65 network associates had rece ived HIV tests, and of those 65 network associates who were tested, 7 of them were newly diagnosed HIV positive individuals. The prevalence rate for those tested at Lane County as part of the SNS project was an astonishing 14%! The statewide stats for SNS: 85 recruiters, 92 networks associates, 116 HIV tests and 7 previously undiagnosed HIV infections, giving us a statewide prevalence rate of 6% for those tested as part of the SNS project. Objective: To describe the benefits of tapping in to clients\u00bf/patie nts\u00bf social networks as a way to target HIV/STD testing services.

One in three children is overweight. More tha n half of adults in Multnomah County, Oregon are overweight or obese, and therefore at risk for serious health conditions including heart disease and diabetes. As a grantee of the the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 's Communities Putting Preventi on to Work (CPPW) program, Multnomah County is conducting a health education campaign to promote healthful behaviors and counter - advertise unhealthy behaviors. The campaign, launched in January 2011, balances two key drivers: 1) dissemination of empowering health promotion messages that inspire hope and describe small steps that individuals can take to affect change in their own 36 communities and 2) dissemination of hard -hitting marketing messages that sound the alarm about the obesity epidemic and the commun ity barriers to healthy living. The It Starts Here Community Education Campaign promotes healthy eating and active living in Multnomah County, Oregon using a web and social media presence, television vignettes, billboards, transit signage and culturally sp ecific news outlets. Participants will learn about strategic messaging, partnering with unusual organizations and how to evaluate the effectiveness of a mass media approach. We will present the multi -media materials we have developed for this hard -hitting campaign and share some tips and pitfalls we have run into along the way. Evaluation of the campaign is being done through the CDC 's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), a health survey that collects information about health risk behaviors a nd health care access and use, primarily related to physical activity, nutrition, and tobacco use. \"Takeaway\" messages for people who attend session: 1) why mass media is an effective tool for influencing healthy behaviors. 2) Resources available to orches trate a mass media -based community education campaign 3) Key strategies to pursue and their relative benefits and considerations. Instructional Strategies - Case presentation - DVD - Handouts - Q & A session Objective: - Identify effective public health m arketing campaigns that educate, enhance, and strengthen the value of, and public 's perception of, public health. - Demonstrate the importance of local health officials positioning themselves in appropriate roles (leadership, community, etc.) to advance lo cal public health.

We strive for the same old ends. And I just can 't wait. Wait for us to become friends. I feel a change coming on . Dylan wasn 't referring to a relationship between arts and health in this song, but his words hold true nonetheless. In the Willamette Valley, the ArtsCare program is strategically building relationships between artists and health professionals to bolster the developm ent of innovative solutions to local community health problems. ArtsCare matches local artists with health professionals to develop and deliver art -based programs aimed at promoting wellness and preventing disease, to create art that encourages physical ac tivity, and to work on strategies to communicate health information. In this session, specific examples of collaborative ventures between artists 37 and community health professionals will be described and p resented photographically. The change comin ' on' is likely to be a lasting one in the Willamette Valley: Qualitative data gathered through interviews with participating artists indicates that using their art to improve community health and well being is not only highly satisfying but is, according to some, the most important work they have ever done. Objective: Describe research findings on how collaboration between the arts and health has been shown to enhance the success of health promotion and disease prevention activities. Describe three examples of co mmunity health promotion activities that are specifically designed around the arts. Describe the ArtsCare program model, a partnership between a local arts organization and a healthcare system aimed at improving community and individual health.

One contributing factor that has been documented in multiple studies is the disadvantages low -income populations face in accessing healthy foods proximate to their neighborhood. However despite Community Development Corporations playing an increasing role in national efforts to increase access to healthy food in low -income neighborhoods, there is very limited data specific to affordable housing residents and healthy foods access. Co -presenters will review the findings of the 2011 Healthy Foods Access Survey, a forty -item assessment distributed among affordable housing residents in North and Northea st Portland, Oregon. This survey was administered to low -income residents of Portland Community Reinvestment Initiatives, Native American Youth Family Center, and Hacienda CDC, 95% of who are from communities of color. Survey items, in conjunction with GIS mapping, were used to investigate the needs, barriers and desires related to healthy foods access, including distance to grocery stores from housing sites, walkability, public transit availability to food access sites, and healthy and culturally -specific food availability and affordability. Presenters will discuss the relationships between affordable housing and healthy food access, as well as the implications for program development in organizations serving affordable housing residents.

The goal of the HRI is to support, encourage and promote voluntary actions by retailers to increase access to healthy, affordable food. In 39 assessments conducted by the Multno mah County Health Department through its ACHIEVE, North Portland HEAL Coalition and the Portland Multnomah Food Policy Council identified a need to increase the availability of healthy, affordable, culturally - relevant food at neighborhood -based stores, par ticularly those serving African American, African, and Latino customers. In order to maximize the reach of the Healthy Retail Initiative, more input is desired from community partners and vendors so that retailers are fully supported in implementing volunt ary actions. The goal of the session is to increase the awareness and reach of the initiative by 1) sharing results of local retail assessments conducted in the African American, African and Latino communities in Portland and 2)sharing lessons learned Objective: Participants will learn about the methods and findings of community -based assessments in retail settings. As time allows, participants will brainstorm next steps that maintain momentum, sustain eff orts and broadly share learning of Healthy Retail Initi ative (HRI).

Concurrent Session #4 40 Topic: Advocacy for Healthy Transportation Title: Crossing the Divide: Effective Advocacy for Healthy Transportation Author: Chris Rall, Tara Sulzen, Mara Gross, and Heidi Guenin (Moderator) Abstract: Transportation has enormous impacts on public health. However, transportation planning can be opaque to non -transportation professionals, making it difficult for public health professionals to provide information in ways that effectively influence decision s and result in better health outcomes. We propose a panel discussion to help public health officials get up -to-speed on the latest transportation policy issues that decision -makers are grappling with at the local, state and federal levels. As part of this set of presentations, we will provide a brief review of the public health resources related to transportation, and more detailed overview of transportation policy and planning issues. At the federal level, the 6 -year transportation reauthorization bill wi ll shape funding, policy and projects for years to come. The state of Oregon is known for its commitment to providing transportation choices for residents, and is currently implementing multiple programs and projects that demonstrate that commitment, but we can do better. We will also review the cycle of regional transportation plans for each region and transportation system plans for each jurisdiction. Objective: 1) Review the authoritative resources available on public health impacts of transportation. 2 ) Gain understanding of transportation policy decisions at various levels of government. 3) Learn the latest status of various transportation legislation and planning processes Presentation Type: Panel Presentation Panel Abstract1: Federal transportation policy has enormous influence over what we build, where we put it, who builds it, how we operate it, and what energy powers it. This has significant impact on public health through effects on traffic collision trauma, air quality, and opportunities for phy sical activity. Our national transportation policy has barely changed since the 1950s, when gas was 20 cents per gallon and President Eisenhower launched the interstate highway system. Federal transportation policy is typically revisited every 6 years in w hat is called the transportation reauthorization. The last reauthorization was to expire Sept. 30, 2009 and has been extended several times, most recently through Sept 30, 2011. House and Senate committees are currently developing a new law. Chris Rall, Or egon Field Organizer for Transportation For America (T4A), will provide an overview of the status of the reauthorization and what opportunities related to this legislation are on the horizon to align transportation policy, planning and funding with better public health outcomes. T4A is a diverse coalition of over 500 organizations and elected officials, including the American Heart Association, NACCHO, Oregon Public Health Institute and Upstream Public Health. APHA is part of T4A's executive committee. Pane l Abstract2: Oregon is often seen as a national leader in integrating land use and transportation policy to create compact walkable communities. However, we still have a long way to go to include health outcomes in planning processes occurring across the state, and in prioritizing transportation projects that improve health. 1000 Friends of Oregon has worked for 36 years to advocate for healthy urban and rural communities with vibrant town centers and walkable neighborhoods where residents don't have to drive for every trip. Tara Sulzen, Outreach Coordinator for 1000 Friends will discuss 41 opportunities to advance public health outcomes in transportation project criteria at the Oregon Department of Transportation, and on opportunities to expand funding for transportation modes that are proven to reduce obesity, improve air quality and save money. Panel Abstract3: Regional and local transportation plans form the basis for how billions of dollars will be spent over the next decades, but most plans do not explicit ly address health. Promoting health through these plans provides a valuable opportunity to reduce inequalities and promote better health outcomes for everyone. Working in partnership with public health professionals, local governments, other non -profits, a nd community members, Coalition for a Livable Future is building health supporting processes, policies, and investments into transportation plans to promote equitable access to healthy, active transportation options and safer, more vibrant communities.

In many cases, urban planning in Portland has created community health benefits. However, until recently, most of these health benefits have been unintentional, and too often not equitably distributed throughout the city's geography or inclusive of all popula tion groups. As part of Multnomah County's Communities Putting Prevention to Work, the Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, Oregon Public Health Institute, Urban League of Portland and the Health Department are currently undergoing efforts to increase the city's capacity to be more intentional and strategic about how healthy and equitable communities can be created through city planning. This panel will talk about the successes, challenges, lessons learned through efforts to incorporate health an d equity into the planning process by not only looking at what infrastructure is developed where and how resources can be equitably distributed, but also how a greater number and diversity of people can be engaged in the process of creating healthy and liv able communities that respond to the unique characteristics of the people who live there. Objective: Participants will learn how to initiate and influence the integration of health 42 and equity into an urban planning process through partnerships and coaliti on building. Presentation Type: Oral Presentation Relentless Pursuit of He alth Equity - the Office of Multicultural Health and Services plan for closing health gaps in Oregon Author: Tricia Tillman, MPH, Leann Johnson, MS, Carol Cheney and Cliff Jones Abstract: In September of 2010 the Office of Multicultural Health and Services (OMHS) commissioned a strategic planning process to set its direction and goals for the next five years. OMHS charged its Community Advisory Council (CAC) to oversee the strategic planning process. The process was very open and inclusive. OMHS received input from a broad range of perspectives and constituencies and gained a clear sense of direction from key stakeholders. The data that informed the plan included: 1. Organizational assessment with OMHS staff and historical documentary review of OMHS. 2. Envi ronmental assessment of similar offices in other states 3. Community and Stakeholder assessment including constituency based focus groups, interviews with OHA Senior Management, key informant interviews and stakeholder electronic surveys. Three strategic p lanning retreats were held in 2011 resulting in an updated vision, mission, values, strategic direction, strategic imperatives and goals and a possible different name for OMHS The plan, adopted by the CAC will be submitted for adoption by the Director of t he Oregon Health Authority in July and shared with the public health community in October 2011. Objective: Public health professionals will strengthen their ability to structure and implement an inclusive strategic planning process. Public health professi onals will increase their understanding of critical strategies for promoting health equity in Oregon.

Tobacco use, physical inactivity, low fruit and vegetable consumption, and overweight or obesity are the biggest risk factors for chronic diseases, and a startling 90% of Oregon adults have one or more of these risk factors, according to BRFSS data. In Oregon, 36% of people who make less than $15,000 per year smoke compared to 9% of those who make $50,000 or more. The Tobacco Control Integration Project (TCIP) mission is to reduce this disparity by bringing tobacco prevention, education and cessation to the people who need it most. TCIP is achieving this mission through forming innovative partnerships with Oregon's health and huma n service agencies. TCIP assists agencies as they change policies and procedures to help clients and employees quit using tobacco and reduce exposure to secondhand smoke. This panel presentation will discuss the policies and procedures that have changed an d the effect these changes are having on client populations and employees. Agency partners will share lessons learned and participants will participate in group work focusing on policy development. Objective: Participants will be able to name at least thr ee policy changes in Oregon's health and human service agencies that will help reduce tobacco use. Participants will be able to discuss at least two roadblocks that often arise when developing policies and state at least one alternative for each barrier.

College students (N= 1247) from a large size university in Oregon participated in the study. Self -reported 44 data were co llected through the American College Health Association Assessment in 2010. Alcohol consumption was measured by an 8 -point scale that asked participants days of using alcohol within the last 30 days. The sleep problem was measured by 4 item scales that ask ed participants\u00bf sleep related problems in the past 7 days. Academic performance was measured by the average GPA. Multiple regression and path analysis were used to analyze the data. Results showed that 21.8% of participants used alcohol more than 6 days a month and 6% participants used alcohol daily. Females had more sleep problem than males. Controlling gender, alcohol consumption was significantly related to sleep problem. More alcohol consumption predicted more sleep problems. More sleep problem also pr edicted lower GPA. Overall, alcohol consumption influenced GPA both directly and indirectly through sleep problem. The model explained 3% of the variance of GPA. College health promotion professionals should focus on decrease alcohol consumption and enhanc e sleep quality among students to help them improve the academic performance. Objective: Participants attending this session will gain knowledge has to how the use of alcohol can impact grades and sleep.

College students (N=1375) from a large size university in Oregon participated in the study. Data were collected through American College H ealth Association Assessment/National College Health Assessment in 2010. Binge drinking is defined as having five or more drinks of alcohol at a setting one or two times in the past two weeks (occasional binge drinker) or three times or more in the past tw o weeks (frequent binge drinker). Unprotected sex was measured by asking participants whether they had unprotected sex as a consequence of drinking within last 12 months. Results showed that 23.7% and 10.3% of female participants were occasional and freque nt binge drinkers, respectively; 24.6% and 21.2% of male participants were occasional and frequent binge drinkers, respectively. Logistical regression results revealed that for females, occasional binge drinkers and frequent binge drinker had significantly higher odds ratio (OR) to have unprotected sex compared to non -binge drinker, OR=2.11(IC=1.29 -3.44), OR=3.65(IC= 2.02 -6.57), respectively. For males, occasional binge drinkers and frequent binge drinker also had 45 higher OR to have unprotected sex compared to non -binge drinker, OR=2.29(IC=1.31 - 3.99), OR=4.55 (IC=2.65 -7.82), respectively. Results provided evidence of binging drinking and unprotected sex among college students. Objective: Participants attending this session will become familiar with the increa sed risk of having unprotected sex as a result of their drinking behaviors.

Author: Scholastique Nikuze, MPH, M. Margaret D PhD, Brian D. Marx, PhD and Aruna Lakshmanan Abstract: Background Initial experimentation with substances often occurs during early adolescence, typi cally in social situations. Individual and social factors have been linked to substance use in ethnically diverse samples cross -sectionally, but longitudinal data are lacking. Methods This longitudinal study examined domain specific self - esteem, in relatio n to crowd membership and cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use in a sample of urban junior high school students. Qualitative methods assessed crowds and crowd membership. Surveys assessed self -esteem (Self -Perception Profile for Children) and behavior. Lo glinear, logistic and multicategorical logit models were used to examine the influence of gender, ethnicity, crowd affiliation, and self -esteem on substance use. Results : Not unexpectedly, substance use increased from 7th grade to 8th grade. Adolescents ' ethnicity, crowd membership, and domain -specific self -esteem were statistically associated (p=. 05) with 8th grade substance use. For example, adolescents with high social self -perception were more likely to be in the Popular/Jock crowd than the Outsider cr owd (OR= 6.8), and Popular/Jocks reported higher use of alcohol (OR=2.28) and pot (OR=7.06) compared to other crowds. Conclusions Domain specific self-esteem and crowd membership are significant predictors of substance use during early adolescence. Social group interventions that target youth most likely to use substances are warranted. Objective: Illustrate that crowd -based studies/social groups are useful in understanding the social factors that contribute to adolescents ' health risk behaviors, such as s ubstance use patterns.

When a mother cannot provide milk for her own infant, donor milk is the best substitute. In this presentation, we will review the history of milk banking, and the current net work of not -for-profit milk banks in North America. We will discuss the Human Milk Bank Association of North America, including the purpose and guiding principles of this organization. Participants will learn the basic purpose of a nonprofit donor milk ban k, and how a donor milk bank screens donors, receives milk donations, processes donor milk, and distributes it. The health and financial benefits of providing donor milk to recipients such as preterm infants, children and adults with special nutritional ne eds will be discussed. We will discuss how the creation of a donor milk bank and the increased use of donor milk can contribute to reducing health care costs and improve health outcomes. Finally, we will review the development of the Northwest Mothers Milk Bank, a donor milk bank in the planning stages, and review the resources needed to start a donor milk bank. Objective: After attending this presentation audience members will be able to list the economic and health benefits that result from the increased use of donor milk.

Ferr\u00e9 DDS Abstract: One cannot have good health w ithout good oral health. The dental profession has always known this, but until Surgeon General David Satcher issued the first report 47 card on Oral Health in America in 2000, discussions amongst public health stakeholders on oral health were few and far bet ween. Oral disease is the most common, chronic disease in children, five times more common than asthma. To have good oral health, one must have EPA: Education, Prevention, and Access to care. The greatest \"bang for the buck\" is prevention of disease. Fluor ide has played a major role in prevention. This presentation will discuss different modalities of fluoride and the effectiveness of water fluoridation. Objective: 1) What causes cavities? 2) How fluoride works. 3) The effectiveness of water fluoridation in terms of public health. 4) How Oregon lags the rest of the country in fluoridation of public water supplies.

Goeke , MPH . Abstract: Background: The 2010 web -based Health Status Report was developed to distribute county health data that had not been updated since the 2000 printed report. Its purpose is to describe the health of Benton County and to facilitate community involvement in ad dressing public health issues through data -driven decisions. However, the complexities of the data and charts in the Report raised staff concerns that community members may struggle to understand the material. Therefore, an academic collaboration was estab lished to make the website more accessible to a wider range of readers by analyzing and improving its readability and usability. Methods: The text was analyzed for reading level using readability formulas. The text and data charts were reviewed using healt h literacy and numeracy concepts. One topic section received further analysis to address web layout and organization. Furthermore, focus groups, key informant interviews, and an online survey were conducted to gather user input on data utilization, content , and web -design. Results: In general, the Report was overly complex in text and data. Most often, the text repeated the information found in data tables without adding value for the reader. Furthermore, the writing style followed scholarly conventions rat her than a more reader -friendly format. Conclusion: The following the next steps will be taken to continuously improve the report in readability and usability for community users: 1. Identify tested and validated alternatives to improve the writing and dat a charts as well as site design. 2. Ongoing analysis and evaluation as data is revised and updated. 3. Create style guide ' to establish standards for content. Objective: Participants will be able to identify methods for evaluating a web -based 48 health stat us report.

With only 2% of nurses being public health nurses, the ratio seems low that public health nurses could have the force to make change. However, when compared to the public health workforce, public health nurses make up 21 -25% of the workforce, creating great opportunity for policy development and change. So where are the public health nurses that are creating policy and impacting population health? This session explores the ways in which public health nurses can be policy driven change agents and work at the foundation of the Prevention model (Frieden, 2010) where prevention makes the biggest impact. The panel will share stories of policy work in their local health department and communities and the challenges they have overcome for policy implementation. Participants will leave feeling empowered to initiate policy development and be influential advocates in their practice. Facilita ted by Tom Engle, RN, OHA -PHD, Community Liaison Manager. Objective: Use nursing skills to initiate policy changes and be advocates. Learn how PHNs have done policy work. Learn strategies in doing policy work.

She is an advocate for families, paving the way for their voices to be heard at stakeholder meetings and decision making tables. Panel Abstract2: Kate Moore, RN, MCH and WIC Program Manager from Deschutes County Health Services convened Behavioral Health to design a seamless service and referral process to prevent and address perinatal depression. They were challenged with the ability to bill for prevention and the lapse in coverage for parents. This issue was 49 carried to the state and federal level . Currently, the extension on coverage for postpartum care with the Oregon Health Plan is being considered. Local providers will be convening to assess the need for services and the capacity to provide affordable care. The Deschutes effort has not only led to advocacy for accessible prevention and care for prenatal depression, but for a system that can support this community need.

At minimum, we will inform counties of our reporting requirements to notify counties of hazardous substance spills in their county. We will also present the historical basis for the program and explain opportunities for partnerships. This presentation can facilitate a better relationship between the HSIS program and county environmental health specialists. We can work towards safer communities with state -county cooperation in hazardous substance emergency event prevention and preparation. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has the congressional mandate to develop and provide the public health and toxicological information for community awareness and emergency planning as a part of CERCLA and SARA Title III. Oregon is one of seven other states funded to perform state -based hazardous substance spill and release surveillance. We use this data to develop education and chemical accident prevention materials. 50 Concurrent Session #5 Topic: Climate change and public health Title: Climate change, extreme heat events and public health implications Author: Mandy Green (Moderator), MPH, Stacy Vynne , MS, Dan Rubado, MPH and Steve Moore, RN Abstract: Heat waves are a significant public health issue and have been shown to result in increased morbidity and mortality. Weather events such as extreme heat are expected to increase in frequency and duration as a result of climate change. Public health agencies have a responsibility to prepare for and respond to heat waves, and may include these events in planning such as hazard vulnerability assessment. Understanding local climate projections and potential h ealth impacts can help public health professionals to build capacity needed to address these events. Objective: Participants will learn about local climate projections and potential health impacts of climate change. Participants will understand heat -relate d illness and death and learn about state and local health planning and response to heat events. Presentation Type: Panel Presentation Panel Abstract1: Integrating climate change in Oregon's health systems. Understanding local climate projections and resul ting health consequences can assist public health professionals in building capacity and programs needed to address climate change. The Resource Innovation Group's Climate Leadership Initiative, with data provided by the Oregon Climate Change Research Inst itute, has recently completed a series of stakeholder engagement workshops in four Oregon watersheds to identify local climate risks and adaptation strategies. The findings from this project are currently being applied to a three -year, CDC funded collabora tion between the Oregon Health Authority and CLI to build climate change capacity in local health jurisdictions. A brief presentation will be provided on the stakeholder engagement workshops and local projections, followed by a discussion on how the proces s and data can be applied to local health jurisdiction decision making around climate change. Panel Abstract2: Heat waves and health outcomes. Introduction: Heat waves are one of the major public health issues associated with climate change and have repeat edly been shown to cause significant morbidity and mortality. However, the temperature point at which an increase in heat -related illness is observed seems to vary with climate. No study has previously identified the temperature thresholds associated with heat - related illness in Oregon. The goal of this analysis is to determine the criteria, within each climate region of the state, that define heat waves with an important impact on public health. Methods: To determine the relationship between heat and healt h effects, we combined aggregated daily data for weather stations, hospital admissions and deaths, based on zip codes. We constructed a negative binomial event count model to calculate the effect of a number of heat metrics on hospitalization and mortality risk for four climate regions in Oregon. We controlled for a number of factors in the analysis, including temporal trends, holidays, the indoor smoking ban, influenza activity and air quality. Panel Abstract3: Public health heat event planning and HVA. S tate and local public 51 health agencies are involved in planning for extreme heat events and will be expected to respond in the event of a heat emergency. Local level hazard vulnerability assessments (HVAs) may indicate populations at increased risk of adver se health effects related to heat. Oregon Health Authority, Public Health Division is crafting guidelines and toolkits for local health partners for heat event planning and response. This presentation will give an overview of the heat event guidelines and toolkits along with several case studies about how these tools were applied locally during the summer months of 2011.

The physical health issues associated with autism (including gastrointestinal and sleep disorders) have been largely ignored. Many insurance companies do not cover medical screenings or treatments for children with a diagnosis of autism. As a result, many physicians face many difficulties providing effective care and treatment for their patients with autism. The Autism Treatment Network (ATN), the nation's first network of h ospitals and physicians to address these issues, was established to develop a comprehensive medical care model that could incorporate both mental and physical health issues for patients with autism. The ATN aims to develop better ways to identify, manage, and treat the physical health conditions of children and adolescents with autism and to advocate for insurers' increased coverage of physical health treatment. This poster presentation will highlight the ATN's method of developing and sharing best practice s to improve medical care for patients with autism. Specifically, it will cover the ATN's common protocol for a multidisciplinary and comprehensive evaluation of children with autism and the Patient Registry database, which includes anonymous clinical data about participating families and patients that can be used to evaluate and track patient care in network facilities, and illuminate further physical health issues associated with autism. Objective: Understand autism as a complex disorder affecting mental and physical health; learn more about the Autism Treatment Network's progress toward developing a comprehensive medical care model that incorporates both mental and physical health.

Developing Preconception Health Recommendations Author: Julie McFarlane, Marjorie McGee, Milbern, Jennifer Cole and Lesa Dixon -Gray Abstract: Background/Purpose: In 2007, the CDC established recommendations fo r preconception health care to young women in the US. While they addressed disparities among populations, one population not addressed were young adults with disabilities. Methods: In 2009, a collaborative of organizations in Oregon applied to participate in an Action Learning Collaborative with the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs (AMCHP) around adolescents and preconception health. The goal was to develop specific recommendations regarding preconception health for young adults with disabi lities. The Youth Action Research Model was used to involve young adults with 54 disabilities at every point in the process. A task force reviewed the literature, data, and conducted a survey of young adults with disabilities and their opinions regarding sexu al and preconception health. Results/Outcomes: National recommendations were developed that will be disseminated through the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs. The review process, challenges around data, survey results, and final preconcept ion health recommendations will be addressed in the presentation. Conclusions/Implications: Preconception health recommendations are specifically necessary for this population, as they often feel invisible regarding sexual health issues. Objective: 1. The participant will be able to identify the issue of greatest concern to young adults with disabilities. 2. The participant will describe the process of surveying young adults with disabilities 3. The participant will be able to discuss preconception health recommendations for young adults with disabilities. 4. The participant will be able to dispel myths about young adults with disabilities and sexuality.

Abstract: The Community Engagement Initiative (CEI) is a community -level intervention that explores the soci al and behavioral determinants of health. Specifically, this intervention is interested in understanding the lived experiences of people with disabilities and how these experiences influence healthful behavior. A desired outcome of CEI is the empowerment o f community members to identify common problems, develop solutions, and engage other community stakeholders in the removal of barriers to healthful behavior. The Community Engagement Initiative methodology consists of three co -related activities: 1) conduc ting community forums (i.e., town hall meetings); 2) meeting with a network of community change agents (i.e., community leaders, agency representatives, etc.); and 3) community resource mobilization through identified organizational strategies (task forces , coalitions, etc.). The Oregon Office on Disability and Health (OODH) and community based disability partner organizations used the Community Engagement Initiative in 8 communities to examine access issues to health 55 and medical services pertinent to peopl e with disabilities. The methodology elucidated community needs and resources from the perspective of people with disabilities, as well as community leaders, agency representatives, and others. The process also resulted in tangible outcomes such as accessi ble transportation services to major medical facilities, hospitals including disability awareness and sensitivity training in new hire orientation, and the development of accessible physical activity programs. Less tangible outcomes include the informal ne twork of individuals willing to address universal access in their communities. Objective: To provide participants with information about best practices, tools, and lessons learned in implementing a Community Engagement Initiative methodology to improve he alth access for everyone in their community Presentation Type: Oral (10 - 15 minutes) A-V Needs: None Danielle Bailey Degrees: MPH Title: Organization/Affiliation: OHSU: Oregon Office on Disability & Health Address: 707 SW Gaines Street Portland Data to Action Title: Development of a prioritization tool to translate maternal, infant, and child health (MICH) data into strategic directions: A practice -based approach and case study, Multnomah County, Oregon, 2011 Author: Sarah -Truclinh Tran, MPH , James A. Gaudino, Jr. MD, MS, MPH , Sandy Johnson, PhD , Mindy Stadtlander, MPH and Jessica Guernsey, MPH Abstract: BACKGROUND: In order to prioritize MICH problems in communities, public health planners often have to make sense of the overwhelming volume and gaps in surveillance data. To support a strategic planning effort, we analyzed surveillance data and d eveloped an objective tool that assisted decision -makers in identifying pressing MICH issues in Multnomah County. METHODS: We grouped county -level MICH indicators and data gaps into nine life -course categories: family planning; preconception health; and mortality; infant care; child growth and development; and home, family, and community factors. The individual indicators were scored against six criteria: disparities by race/ethnicity, economic status, and maternal age; worsening trends; unmet Healthy People 2020 goals; and large population affected. Scores were weighted to account for missing information. The higher scores indicated a greater need. RESULTS: Of the 23 indicators examined, the highest ranked scores we re: unintended pregnancy, maternal depression, immunizations, father un -involvement, and others. Groups with the highest scores were: family planning, child growth and development, and home, family and community factors. Limitations include data gaps on ke y indicators and the use of only quantitative 56 data. Nevertheless, this user -friendly prioritization tool assisted decision -makers at a local health department to translate surveillance data into strategic directions. Objective: Participants will learn: - How epidemiological data was used to guide a strategic planning process at a county health department. - An example of an objective tool developed for decision -makers to make sense of the overwhelming volume of and gaps in MICH data.

According to the 2007 Oregon Smile Survey, 59.3% of 1st graders in Oregon have or had a cavity. In spite of it s high prevalence, tooth decay is a preventable disease. The Oregon Oral Health Program in collaboration with the Oregon Oral Health Coalition (OROHC) launched a three -year workforce development project with the goal to reduce early childhood caries (ECC) in Oregon. Methods: The Oregon Oral Health Unit launched the First Tooth project with the goal to reduce tooth decay by training medical providers and general dentists to implement preventive oral health services for children under three. Face -to-face tr ainings are currently being implemented. However to increase sustainability, a comprehensive, web -based oral health resource and training site is in development and will be launched in early October. Results/outcomes: The First Tooth project is expanding outreach and training statewide. The goals of the training program are to: 1) Engage both medical and dental providers in providing culturally appropriate early childhood caries prevention activities in their offices and clinics; and 2) Facilitate collaborative referral relationships between dentists and primary medical care providers in order that all Oregon children ages birth to three years have a dental home. The goal of the online training is to create a web -based training that can be replicated and used across Oregon. Evaluation results on process and outcome measures will be reported. Conclusions/implications: Both medical and dental communities can become experts in children's oral health prevention strategies and advocates for oral health as a part of overall health. Objective: 1. Discuss the value of collaborative partnerships across disciplines to implement successful oral health promotion and tooth decay prevention efforts. 2. Understand the importance of c ollaboration of medical providers and dental providers to improve infant and children's oral health and prevent early childhood tooth decay. 3. Discuss steps taken to implement an early childhood caries prevention online training program . 58 4. Articulate les sons learned, including barriers and pitfalls. 5. Describe First Tooth program components and outcomes.

Hoffman, ND, MD , Ellen G. Peck, RN, CCRC and John C. Mayberry, MD Abstract: Daily counts of bike commuters in Portland continue to increase. Limited data exist on the types and incidence of injuries sustained during bike commuting. We conducted prospective surveillance of self -reported injuries in a cohort of 962 adults for a 1-year period, in 2007 -08. A baseline questionnaire and monthly surveys were completed online. Riders commuted by bike an average of 10 days per month, with an average roundtrip of 11 miles. 164 riders (18%) reported 192 injury events and 49(5%) reported 50 ev ents in which a physical injury was severe enough to require medical attention (\"serious injury\"). The most common sites of injury were legs and arms, and skin. The annual incidence per 100,000 miles travelled for all injury events was 15.0 (CI 13.2 -17.5), and for serious injury events was 3.9 (CI 2.9 -5.1). No significant differences were observed in injury rates by age, gender, safety practice, or experience. However, use of a helmet at the time of an injury event was associated with a lower risk of seriou s injury (unadjusted OR = 0.32, CI = 0.12 -0.89). Poor roadway conditions and motor vehicles were reported in 20% and 48% of serious injury events, respectively, suggesting they are important contributors to serious injury. Objective: 1. Define the types an d incidence of injuries sustained by adults who commute to work by bicycle in a metropolitan area ; 2. Identify the personal and built environment factors associated with bike commuting injuries ; 3. Identify opportunities for injury prevention among bike co mmuters Presentation Type: Oral (10 - 15 minutes) or Poster A-V Needs: None indicated Name: William Lambert Degrees: PhD Organization/Affiliation: OHSU/Center for Healthy Communities Address: 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd.

Existing tools for assessing the impact of transportation and land use projects on health and equity are not designed to integrate health -related performance measures early enough in project development to effectively change health outc omes. As part of Multnomah County Health Department's Communities Putting Prevention to Work, the Portland Bureau of Transportation, Upstream Public Health, the North American Sustainable Transportation Council and the Health Department are jointly develop ing a tool to integrate evidence -based and emerging strategies and guidelines into transportation projects and plans that will lead to measurable increases in physical activity. This tool will allow users to acquire baseline data, establish quantifiable go als and objectives and to use performance metrics and analytic methodologies to evaluate potential transportation investments to increase equitable opportunities for physical activity. Objective: Participants will learn about alternative approaches to asse ssing health and equity impact of transportation projects and plan strategies Presentation Type: Panel Presentation Panel Abstract 1: Abstract for Presentation by Alejandro Queral: We Have Health Impact Assessments, so why do we need a new tool? This prese ntation will provide the context and rationale that led to the development of an alternative health and equity assessment tool. The discussion will focus on why and how a vision was developed, how stakeholders were identified and engaged, and the needed po licy framework for implementation of the tool. Panel abstract 2: Abstract for Presentation by Peter Hurley: This presentation will explain the Sustainable Transportation Analysis & Rating System (STARS), which is a planning and evaluation tool for transpor tation projects and plans. STARS explicitly evaluates multimodal access benefits and costs over the full life cycle of a project, making it an ideal platform in which to incorporate health and equity rating credit for transportation plans and projects. The presentation will explain the general concepts behind STARS and will discuss the reasons why it is suitable for assessing and improving the health and equity outcomes of transportation projects and plans. Panel abstract 3: Abstract for Presentation by He idi Guenin: In this presentation, participants will learn about the steps involved in the development of a Health and Equity Credit for STARS, including the results of a literature review related to transportation health and equity metrics and the results of a policy scan to discover current best practices related to health, equity, and transportation. The discussion will explore how to establish quantifiable health and equity goals and objectives early in project development in order to influence project p erformance measures and investment strategy analysis.

Tobacco use, physical inactivity, low fruit and vegetable consumption, a nd overweight or obesity are the biggest risk factors for chronic diseases, and a startling 90% of Oregon adults have one or more of these risk factors, according to 2009 BRFSS data. By advancing policies, environments and systems that promote health and m anage chronic disease, all people in Oregon can have the opportunity to live, work, play, and learn in communities that support health and an optimal quality of life. In this session, Kirsten Aird with the Oregon Health Authority's Health Promotion and Chr onic Disease Prevention Program will provide an overview of the integrative approach that has been implemented in Oregon, and is becoming more common in federal funding opportunities for public health programs. Sara Hartstein of Benton County Health Depart ment and Ashley Swanson of the Columbia Health District will share their experiences as local programs creating tobacco -free environments and policy, systems, and environmental changes that support healthy active living. Panelists will discuss project outc omes to date, as well as implications for continuing to build capacity to address health promotion and chronic disease prevention for healthy communities.

A Survey of Knowledge and Attitudes of Oregon College Women Author: Debi Elliot, Renee Hackenmiller -Paradis, Jessica Staudinger and Tonya McLean Abstract: Background/purpose: There is growing concern about health effects caused by chemical ingredients found in personal care products, ranging from contact dermatitis to cancer. The term personal care products ' (PCPs) is not defined by law but generally refers to health and beauty items found in drug stores. The primary aim of this study was to gather data about chemicals that people are exposed to from PCPs on a regular basis. The secondary aim was to gather basic information about people 's knowledge and behaviors regarding product content (e.g., reading labels before purchase), bel iefs about product regulation and toxic effects on humans, and quality of information they receive about them. Methods: An anonymous, on -line survey of over 1,000 PSU female undergraduates to determine the number and types of PCPs they use. Additional surv ey questions addressed attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about the regulation of chemicals in PCPs. Results/outcomes: The final report with results is expected in July and will be discussed in the presentation. It will include survey results, details of th e chemicals used in PCPs, highlight potential health impacts of these chemicals, and provide tips and tools to reduce exposures and advocate for better regulation of these products. Conclusions/implications: The researchers anticipate that participants use a high number of PCPs on a regular basis (10+) resulting in large and continuous exposure to the chemical ingredients with potential impacts to health. Objective: Improve public health practitioners ' knowledge of this source of chemical exposure and its p otential health effects.

Walters, MPH and Trena Van DeHey, BS Abstract: Background. Lead poisoning in adults continues to be mainly an occupational problem. Elevated blood lead levels (EBLL) can damage the nervous, hematologic, reproductive, renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal symptoms. There is a growing body of evidence that lead exp osures at low levels previously thought to be of little concern can result in an increased risk of adverse chronic health effects if the exposure is maintained for many years. Public health agencies as well as regulatory agencies have unique roles and can collaborate to reduce the burden of lead poisoning in adults. Methods : In 2009, staff of the Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology & Surveillance (ABLES) Program met with OSHA to discuss implementation of the new OSHA National 62 Emphasis Program (NEP) for lead. Oreg on OSHA then developed and published a Program Directive for the NEP. As part of a coordinated effort, every quarter Public Health provides OSHA a list of firms with occupational EBLL cases of 25 \u00b5g/dL or greater. Public Health also refers cases to OSHA wh en requested to do so by companies or individuals, and when confidentiality can be assured. Results : Collaboration has resulted in timely referrals of non -fixed establishments (e.g. bridge painting). It has also helped to identify workplaces that otherwise would not have been identified as a priority for inspection. We also identified a reduction in employee exposures after inspection. Conclusions : Collaboration between public health and OSHA can identify OSHA 's unmet data needs (e.g., data for targeting, i mpact evaluation, standard setting). It can also identify opportunities for increased collaboration in conducting outreach, education and training to employers, workers and health professionals. Objective: 1) Describe the role of public health and regulat ory agencies in the prevention of lead poisoning. 2) Discuss how collaboration between public health and OSHA can mutually benefit both organizations.

Author: Sharon Johnson M.S. and Jackson Baures MM, REHS Abstract: The Outreach Collaborative for Healthy Oregon (OCHO) was recently launched by Oregon State University 's College of Public Health and Human Sciences. University faculty and Extension faculty in southern Oregon are working in active partnership with Jackson and Josephine health departments on a rabies prevention and education project that uses 4 -H youth to carry the message about the important role of vaccinations. Don 't Let Rabies Get Your Goat! responds to the dramatic increase in animal rabies in southern Oregon over the last two years. Resistant -to-vaccinate families live off the grid in high -risk, population -dense areas where wild and domesticated animals inter -mingle. The university -community partnership is using classic public health approaches, innovatively delivered in community settings, to educate at -risk populations with the goal of ch anging vaccination behavior. The results are expected to surface ideas and approaches with the potential to change the behavior of vulnerable families who are also resistant to immunizing their children or themselves. Objective: -Acquire an improved under standing of how to design and implement successful university/community public health collaborations -Obtain information about the threat of animal rabies in Oregon and explore the likelihood of an increase in 63 human rabies -Acquire new information about va ccination resistance in vulnerable populations Presentation Type: Oral (10 - 15 minutes) A-V Needs: None Name: Sharon Johnson Degrees: MS Title: Associate Professor Organization/Affiliation: Oregon State University Address: 569 Hanley -regulation, and School Achievement Title: Children's Self -regulation as a Media tor between Physical Activity and Achievement Author: Derek R. Becker, Megan McClelland and Stewart G. Trost Abstract: To address the cognitive and health effects of physical activity in young children, the present study investigated if natural active play during recess was associated with self -regulatory skills and academic achievement in a pre -kindergarten sample. Fifty -one children (Head Start n = 25, M = 4.75 years) were assessed on self - regulation and physical activity measures. Self -regulation was measured using the Head -Toes -Knees -Shoulders (HTKS), Day -Night, and Dimension Change Card Sort, which assess attention, working memory, and inhibitory control. Children 's early reading, math, and vocabulary were assessed using the Woodcock -Johnson Tests o f Achievement. Physical activity levels were measured during a 30 minute recess using an ActiGraph GT1M accelerometer. Stored activity counts were converted to estimates of time spent in sedentary, light, and moderate -to-vigorous physical activity using established count thresholds. Results showed that higher physical activity was associated with better self -regulation on the HTKS, which in turn, was associated with higher scores on reading, math, and vocabulary. Moreover, children 's self -regulation signifi cantly mediated the relation between physical activity and the achievement outcomes. Specifically, higher physical activity was significantly related to higher vocabulary and math skills through better self -regulation. Results point to the benefits of acti ve play for promoting self -regulation, and offer insight into possible interventions designed to promote self -regulation and academic achievement. Objective: To investigate the benefits of active play on cognitive skills and early learning. To examine rel ations between physical activity, self -regulation, and academic achievement in young children.

Topic: Functional Difficulties present in children with special health care needs Title: Functional Difficulties of Children with Special Health Needs Author: Donald J. Lollar, Ed.D. , Marilyn Sue Hartzell, MEd and Mar y Ann Evans, PhD, MPH Abstract: Identifying and describing the characteristics of children with special health care needs has evolved in importance to pediatrics over the past 25 years. An expanded definition of this popul ation emerged that is based primarily on medication, service usage, or functional limitation. This more inclusive non -categorical non -diagnostic approach is used at the public health level, but has not substantially influenced the medical and health condit ion-specific orientation of a majority of policy, service program, research agencies, or allocation of resources in the US. Rather, emphasis has moved from one health condition to another based on perceived need, advocacy efforts, and at times data -based e stimates of the magnitude of the condition. Regardless of which condition holds our attention, resources are often unbalanced. This leaves children and youth who are not living with the current or well -funded \"right\" health condition with few available res ources. Nonetheless, many of the health conditions, whether frequent or uncommon, share similar functional difficulties. The commonalities across health conditions are lost in the well -meaning efforts aimed at assuring that specific individual health condi tions are given due attention. Data from the 2005 -2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) provide the first opportunity to link health conditions with functional difficulties. This valuable dataset begins to highlight the co mmon functional difficulties across health conditions, and thus helps support the need to broaden, and integrate, our clinical and public health perspectives to provide more inclusive and efficient science, policies, interventions and resource allocations for this population of children and youth. Objective: To understand functional limitations, their correlation with specific health conditions present in the population of the children with special health care needs, and the potential for impacting policy, practice and outcomes.

Co-Presenter 3: Ann Evans, evansmar@ohsu.edu Topic: Water access in schools Title: Encouraging Student Water Consumption: A School Environmental Change Project Author: Henderson, T., Bournhonesque, R. and Manfre, S. Abstract: Upstream Public Health implemented a multi -school multi -component demonstration project to increa se student consumption of tap water as an element of obesity prevention and as a foundation for future efforts in other school districts. The project intervention included four components: 1) school wellness policy changes, 2) access changes with filtered and chilled water stations and water bottles, 3) a water slogan -design contest to promote drinking water, and 4) nutrition education specific to sugar sweetened beverages. Upstream Public Health, a health policy advocacy non - profit, worked with school dist rict administrators and staff at one Oregon school district to develop the project, implement the project elements, and evaluate the projects ' success. We used student surveys and water monitors to evaluate water consumption changes. Preliminary results in dicate installing water stations in conjunction with water bottles increases student water consumption with mixed effects on student sugary beverage consumption. The project successfully supported district -wide wellness policy efforts centered on nutrition . We conclude that multi -component interventions including school infrastructure changes are a promising method for reducing student consumption of sugary beverages. We recommend additional research to determine which combination of elements will result in the greatest student beverage consumption changes. Objective: Participants attending the workshop will be able to 1) identify intervention elements and related student beverage consumption changes, 2) discuss the challenges and benefits of making school environment changes to address child obesity, and 3) discuss lessons learned regarding school infrastructure changes.

Risk stratification, care management, and health coaching by nurses align with public health strategies to improve the health of an at -risk population. Methods Pilot teams adapted evidence based guidelines into clinical practice standards. Clinic leadership teams were trained to support PCMH teams durin g transformation of the nurse role. Nurses received stepped training over four months to support workload balancing, team communication, and coaching skills. Outcomes Caseloads for community health nurses have transitioned from untrackable, undefined popul ations to active caseloads of 20 -40 patients per nurse. Data from pilot teams suggest an increase in reduction of depression symptoms by 50% in the care managed population. Early population data for diabetes and depression in clinics implementing disease management show improvement trends. Implications Chronic disease management integrates public health principles into primary care. The diverse skill set of nurses is well-suited to lead transformation of primary care practice toward preventive management an d health promotion. Utilizing nurses for disease management in primary care is a good first step toward maximizing the role of nurse in the PCMH. Objective: --Provide a framework for development of chronic disease management programs in primary care --Provide a framework for improving population health in primary care --Demonstrate the enhanced role of the nurse in chronic disease management implementation Presentation Type: Oral (10 - 15 minutes) A-V Needs: None indicated Name: Casey Boland Degrees: MSN Title: Chronic Disease Management Program Coordinator Organization/Affiliation: Multnomah County Health Department Address: 426 SW Stark St, 9th floor Portland OR 97204 Primary Phone: Navigation Program Title: Patient Navigators: Addressing Care Coordination for the Underserved Author: Todd Broderius, Patrick Callahan , Amy Cooper, Jennifer Gonnella , Lori Lambert and Katie Ulin Abstract: As part of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 's Ladder to Leadership fellowship, a group of six early career managers from non -profit healthcare 67 organizations came together to create and launch a Patient Navigator Program. Working with a pilot clinic, Wallace Medical Concern (WMC), the group designed, implemented and evaluated a patient navigator program to help uninsured individuals better connect to community resources. There have been other patient navigator programs recently develo ped nationally, however, ours is unique as it is using volunteers as navigators. In selecting and designing this project, our group focused specifically on the experience of uninsured patients, the barriers they face in receiving coordinated care in the ri ght setting at the right time, and the themes of self -advocacy and navigation that have become more prominent as health care reform evolves. We have put together a Patient Navigator Program Toolkit that has served as the basis for setting up the pilot prog ram at WMC. If other clinics choose to adopt the Patient Navigator program, the toolkit will guide them through setting up the program in their clinic, and be a resource to the navigators themselves. The tool kit includes many items: training materials, pa tient navigator job description and evaluation tools. Objective: Lessons from development and implementation of a volunteer based patient navigation program in a safety net clinic.

Despite a long public health commitment to contraception access and preconception care, there are no structural links to facilitate the incorporation of preventi ve reproductive health care into an already overburdened primary care system. The Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health 's ONE KEY QUESTION (OKQ) is designed to improve both preconception care and contraceptive cou nseling by asking the question Do you want to become pregnant in the next year? ' routinely during primary care visits. If a woman answer ed yes', she would be screened for conditions affecting a pregnancy and advised to take folic acid. If a woman answer ed no' or unsure ', the clinician would ensure that she is using a contraceptive method she is satisfied with and is aware of Emergency Contraception. 68 We conducted our first pilot study of OKQ at Oregon Health & Science University 's Richmond Family Medicine Clinic, and this session will review the results of that pilot. Our primary goal was to determine the feasibility of incorporating pregnancy intention screening into primary care visits. We will discuss the success and challenges of implementation, present a small amount of outcome data, and discuss qualitative data from patients, clinic support staff and clinicians about their experience with OKQ. Objective: 1. Describe the importance of routine screening for pregnancy intention in primary care 2. Review various methods of conducting pregnan cy intention screening so as not to interfere with the primary reason for the visit 3. Examine results of the first pilot of OKQ which looked at feasibility and early outcomes.

Johnson Abstract: A Federal Medical Station (FMS) is a resource from the CDC 's Strategic National Stockpile program available for use in the event that a major public health disaster overwhelms the local healthcare system resources. All Oregon local health departments are mandated to plan for the us e and ongoing support of an FMS. With guidance from local health care systems and state and local emergency management partners, Lane County Public Health (LCPH) developed written plans and memoranda of understanding (MOU) to support the placement of an FM S in Lane County, Oregon. This planning experience yielded a number of tools and resources that can be useful to other health departments embarking on a similar process. Furthermore, critical questions arose during planning that a community needs to resolv e in order to have an effective and coordinated public health and medical response in the aftermath of a major disaster. This session will highlight the main tools developed, will introduce the most interesting lessons learned and will share some \u00bfoutside the box\u00bf planning tips that are not always obvious to public health professionals and preparedness planners. Audience members will also learn about the role of public health in facilitating planning for resources to support major disaster response and reco very at the local level. Objective: Session participants will gain an awareness of : 1. Medical shelter planning tools 2. What questions need to be addressed by a community to mount an effective, coordinated disaster response 3.

Title: Addiction at the Crossroads: Moving from a war on drugs' to a public health' framework for addiction Author: David Rogers, Caylor Roling and Patty Katz 70 Abstract: For forty years, federal and state policies have criminalized addiction through the War on Drugs. In that time, the medical community has come to recognize addiction as a disease, but public policy still lags behind medicine, criminalizing addiction and addicts. In this presentation, advocates with combined 30 years of experience working with addiction, public policy and the criminal justice system will discuss policy changes that can move us away from the criminalization of addiction and toward a true public health approach. Objective: Participants in the session should be able to: Outl ine the problems with addressing addiction strictly within the criminal justice context. Understand the Four Pillars approach to addiction. Understand how the Four Pillars framework can be used to shift public policy toward a public health approach to ad diction and highlighting potential/projected benefits. Presentation Type: Panel Presentation Panel Abstract1: David Rogers will examine the implications and outcomes of criminalizing addiction. He will cover how criminalizing addiction affects public safe ty, state and national budgets, prison populations, and funding for prevention, treatment and recovery services. He will also provide information on how policy decisions, not science or best practices, drive the criminalization of addiction. Panel Abstract 2: Caylor Roling will offer an alternative framework to shift policy and thinking away from the criminalization of addiction and toward a more health -centered approach. In public discourse, we often hear that a healthcare or public health approach to addic tion is needed, and the Four Pillars approach, which includes prevention, treatment, harm reduction and public safety, provides a concrete framework for engaging policy makers and the public around what a public health approach to addiction should look lik e. We will discuss how this framework has been used to create significant change in the way New York and Vancouver, BC approach addiction. Panel Abstract3: Patty Katz will discuss the importance of engaging people in recovery from drug and alcohol addictio n in policy change work. She will explain how people impacted by addiction are working for local and state policy changes in Oregon and across the country.

It has been well documented that limited English proficient (LEP) persons have difficulty accessing medical care and have poorer health outcomes than the populati on at large. Health care interpreters are able to bridge the barrier of language and culture that exists between health care providers and LEP patients, allowing LEP patients access to the care they need. This presentation identify the challenges faced by mental health professionals, health care interpreters, patients, and institutions providing mental health services; introduces the Health Care Interpreter profession, modalities for interpretation services, legal implications for not using interpreters in healthcare settings, and gives tips for utilizing foreign language interpreters. Attendees will leave this presentation able to discuss the role healthcare that interpreters play in increasing cultural competency between healthcare providers and LEP patien ts working in mental health settings. Objective: Discuss the role that healthcare interpreters play in increasing cultural competency between healthcare providers and limited English proficient patients working in mental health settings.

Goeke, MPH Abstract: Background: Nationally, people with serious mental health illness die, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population (NASMHPD, 2006). Oregon residents who have received substance abuse and/or mental health treatment through the public sector have an average age of death that is much lower than the general population (Oregon DHS AMH, 2008). Benton County Health Department (BCHD) is interested i n determining the mental health mortality rates among four populations: general Benton County population, Benton County Health Center (BCHC) primary care clients, BCHC clients diagnosed with mental illness, BCHC Mental Health only clients. BCHD is assessin g premature mortality among its clients and is establishing a baseline for how its rates compare with Oregon and nationally for future monitoring. Methods: BCHD gathered data from BCHC medical records and death certificates. The data will be used to calcul ate mortality rates, average age at death, and years of potential life lost. 72 Comparisons will be made between all groups. Conclusions: BCHD will use the findings to improve mental health client services. BCHD will also use the findings to improve workflow and guide the strategic planning process. This study will look at the limitations and challenges of conducting a mental health epidemiological study at the local level .

Rosenberg and Alexis Helsel Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We explored whether women were equally likely to report postpartum depressive symptoms when asked 3 months after birth or 2 years after birth. METHOD S: Oregon PRAMS asks women to report symptoms of depression at 2 times: T1 (PRAMS): during pregnancy T2 (PRAMS): since they baby was born Oregon PRAMS - 2 asks women to report symptoms of depression at 2 times: T3 (PRAMS -2): during the first 12 months of the child's life T4 (PRAMS -2): during the second 12 months of the child's life 1911 women whose children were born in 2004 or 2005 responded to both the PRAMS and the PRAMS -2 surveys. The weighted response rate was 56.6%. RESULTS: Respondents reported symptom s of 24 months postpartum): 22.1% DISCUSSION: Women were almost 3 times as likely to report postpartum depression 2 years postpartum as the y were to report postpartum depression 3 months postpartum. Possible reasons for this discrepancy: (1) different questions; (2) different time periods; (3) denial. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: If depressed women are unable to identify depressive symptoms in the first few months after birth then the screening tests that are currently in use may be insufficient; additional detection methods may be necessary. Objective: 1. How can self -reported depression be assessed in a survey? 2. In multiple time periods, w hat proportion of respondents report self -reported depression?

Author: Larissa Guran, MPH 74 Abstract: BACKGROUND: The cesarean delivery rate in the United States has increased precipitously for the last 3 decades. Complex factors have influenced this development, including the increased safety of the procedure, demographic changes in the patient population, health care and malpractice insurance changes. As the rate has surpassed 33% for low risk women, diverse parties are becoming interested in influencing the reduction of the cesarean delivery rate. Public policy and scientific research organizat ions and credentialing organizations like the Joint Commission have addressed the issue, as has the ACOG. Additionally, non -medical interests are attempting to influence cesarean delivery rates. METHODS: Comprehensive model for reducing costs and quality i mprovement has been developed. This model is derived from previous professional experience and empirical and conceptual work on matters relating to cesarean quality improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the prevalence of cesarean delivery, a multifaceted mo del is necessary to improve outcomes and reduce costs. Clinicians must be supported in engaging in non -paternalistic patient risk counseling, provided with accurate data regarding their individual practice and the broader context of their performance on id entified patient outcomes. In the model presented, medico -legal issues and physician education and support on the topic are also addressed. Nursing staff and hospital administrators can be supported with specific research -based norms and development of a p rofessionally supportive culture on the unit and up the clinical ladder. Patients need clear and accurate education to manage expectations regarding induction and cesarean risk reduction. Objective: Learners will be able to identify contributing factors to current cesarean delivery rates and insertion points for quality improvement relative to those factors.

Kent Anger Abstract: The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)'was passed in 1993 as the first federal law to address family leave. Employers are required to grant up to 1 2 weeks of leave to eligible employees. Surveys have shown that since its enactment, employees have increasingly used the leave law. However, a significant amount of employees (up to 75 49%) are still unaware of the existence or the eligibility requirements o f the law. Especially front line supervisors, as the first to learn about an employee's condition, should receive education to inform and guide the employee. A 45 -minute computer - based Family Medical Leave training was developed and administered to 793 cou nty supervisors from 26 Oregon counties. A survey conducted prior to the training revealed that 30% of the supervisors had not received previous training on FMLA. The supervisors demonstrated significant improvement in test performance (pre -test: 61% to post-test: 94%, p<.001) with greatest improvement in topics regarding benefit coverage, differences between federal and state regulations, employer responsibilities and military leave regulations. This and the large effect size (d) of 2.0 indicated a high de gree of training effectiveness and learning. Furthermore, the training received good or excellent ratings from 74% - 86% of the participants. Objective: Determination of general degree of knowledge on FMLA and the workplace climate towards FMLA in a super visor population and the potential and impact of training.

To obtain incentive dollars, eligible providers must demonstrate meaningful use' (MU) of EHRs by electronically reporting immunizations to Public Heal th (PH); hospitals must report data for one of three PH objectives: immunizations, reportable laboratory results or syndromic surveillance. The Public Health Informatics Initiative (PHII) was created to connect PH to HIE through technical assistance to pro viders and Public Health programs. PHII is funded by the Medicaid Health Information Technology Project (MHIT). Methods: The PHII: Participates in state HIE planning efforts in collaboration with providers and hospitals through the web, in -person presentat ions and pilots Researches, recommends enhancements, Implements and leverages HIE infrastructure for PH Results/Outcomes: Improved PH practice through real -time reporting, access to clinical data and use of standards.

Want some help? Consider the Lean Daily Management System. Author: Shanie Mason, MPH, CHES and Laurie Johnson, MA, RDH Abstract: Background/purpose: Research shows that school -based dental sealant programs are one of the most effective public health measures to prevent cavities in a population. Since the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) established the state School Dental Sealant Program (DSP) in 2007, the number of Oregon counties served increased from 4 to 31. Yet, only 56% of the eligible schools have programs. Methods: To improve program performance, the OHA enlisted the help of the L ean Daily Management System (LDMS). The LDMS is a management approach to help work groups improve their processes. LDMS simplifies communication, promotes teamwork, identifies and solve problems, measures progress, and establishes goals for improvement. Results/outcomes: The DPS now has clearly defined metrics, specific goals have been established, problems are identified and resolved, all team members contribute, and communication has improved immeasurably. Conclusion: The DSP is moving forward in a quanti fiable manner. By implementing the LDMS in one program, the other Unit programs have learned by proxy. Objective: Introduce the Lean Daily Management System (LDMS). Share the key components and explain their value. Demonstrate a daily huddle. Identify methods of determining metrics.

HIV Alliance has utilized a dental case manager to facilitate access to and retention in o ral health care for people living with HIV in 18 counties in Oregon for the past 5 years. The Dental Case Manager facilitates access to dental care and linkages to other services, including primary care. While the model is similar to medical case managemen t, this individual is dedicated to the dental program. Method Clients are referred by their HIV Case Manager to the Dental Case Manager who links them to the dental clinic. The Dental Case Manager has regular contact with clients and helps them make dental appointments, provides transportation assistance, helps clients negotiate barriers to care and provides information to clients and HIV Case Managers across the state. Results/Outcomes: This position has helped to decrease the number of missed appointments and has increased the accessibility of the dental clinic to clients who otherwise would be unable to access care due to multiple barriers including transportation, financial and ability to manage tasks. Objective: By the end of this session participants will be able to: Describe the role of a dental case manager in increasing access to and retention in oral health care.

While recognizing that much progress has been made, we continue to see racial and ethnic groups disproportionately burdened by negative health outcomes. As public health has shifted towards addres sing \"health inequities,\" or those disparities that are result of social, economic and environmental determinants, it begs the question: How does public health address injustice? This session will examine the definitions and understandings of justice princ iples and models to show why public health should play a more active role in creating a paradigm shift that addresses the root cause of health inequities: Injustice. Participants will learn about models that have been successful using a justice paradigm, d iscuss programs that are looking at general health equity, and brainstorm how areas of public health can directly address health -related injustices. Objective: Participants will: 1. understand definitions of justice and how they apply to public health. 2. identify ideas for incorporating principles of justice into their daily work. 3. recognize the importance and impact of policy decisions that affect health outcomes Presentation Type: Oral (10 - 15 minutes) A-V Needs: None indicated Name: Ben Duncan Degree s: BS Title: Program Development Specialist Organization/Affiliation: Multnomah County Environmental Health Address: 3653 Southeast Community Advocacy in Legislative Session Title: Senate Bill 97: The State's Role in Promoting Diverse Community -Based Advocacy for Equity in the Policy Making Process Author: Rachel Gilmer and Tricia Tillman Abstract: The Office of Multicultural Health and Services seeks to engage racially and ethnically diverse community organizations throughout Oregon in the legislative advocacy process. As such, in February of 2010, OMHS held two policy forums with community partners to discuss policy priorities for Oregon's diverse populations. Overwhelmingly, culturally competent health care was prioritized as an effective strategy for eliminating health disparities. After conducting research on other state -level 81 initiative s to promote culturally competent care, OMHS drafted Legislative Concept 650, mandating culturally competent continuing education for health care providers as a condition of re -licensure. In January of 2011, LC650 was adopted into the Governor's budget and referred to the Senate Health Care, Human Services and Rural Health Policy Committee, becoming Senate Bill 97. Throughout the session, OMHS met with various stakeholders, including community organizations, county health departments, health care providers, licensing boards and professional medical organizations to receive feedback on SB97. In collaboration with these partners, the bill was amended to meet the needs of various communities and stakeholders. These changes included, expanding cultural competenc e beyond race, ethnicity and language to include economic status, disabilities, religions, gender, sexual orientations, and other characteristics as well as removing the mandate and instead directing the Oregon Health Authority to work with stakeholders to explore options for cultural competence continuing education and reporting recommendations for implementation, including implementation dates, to the appropriate legislative committee in 2012. The bill received overwhelming support from nearly one -hundred culturally and professionally diverse stakeholders, including health systems such as, The Oregon Medical Association, The Oregon Nurses Association, Care Oregon, Legacy Health and Providence Health and Services, large advocacy organizations, such as Plann ed Parenthood and The Archimedes Movement and statewide community -based groups, who lobbied weekly in Salem, organized a petition with over 500 hundred signatures and received media attention from groups such as, OPB, The Oregonian and Blue Oregon. Despite the diversity of support from groups impacted by the bill, SB97 died on the House floor. Several challenges were encountered regarding the bill, among them included the perceived fiscal impact of this legislation. Despite having been analyzed with a minim al fiscal impact, there were still demands for further review. Although Senate Bill 97 did not pass into law, it was ultimately an incredibly successful process, with culturally diverse community based organizations, many of whom had never participated in a legislative session, bringing diverse voice to the Capitol, building statewide, culturally and professionally diverse coalitions around issues of racial justice, developing lasting partnerships with legislators and other stakeholders and having collectiv ely brought issues of equity to the forefront, where such conversations might have otherwise been absent. All of this has strengthened the public's ability to advocate successfully in the future and has brought us closer to a more equitable Oregon. This pr esentation will explore the successes and challenges of this process and the important progress made around culturally diverse community advocacy at a state policy level as well as next steps for continuing to fight for equitable legislation that addresses health disparities. Objective: To inform policy makers and other advocates of how we can better engage diverse communities and community based organizations in the policy development, advocacy and implementation process.

Schools are an ideal place to equitably increase these opportunities by creating a healthy school environment through developing, adopting and implementing wellness policies, and making system and physical changes to support increased physical activity and healthy eating. The Multnomah County Health Department, funded through a CDC Communities Putting Prevention to Work grant, is working with 7 school districts (72,000 students) in the County to address health equity through this work. Policies, systems and environmental changes address health equity by targeting and engaging high -risk students. This approach is m ore cost effective, sustainable, and more successful at addressing childhood obesity compared to traditional programmatic work. Objective: Understand why policies, system and environmental changes are important Learn about the challenges of implementing p olicies, system and environmental changes in order to effectively address health equity Review innovation student wellness policies Presentation Type: Oral (10 - 15 minutes) Name: Sandra Clark Degrees: MPH Title: Healthy Active Schools tion/Affiliation: Parkrose District derrick.j.travers@multco.us LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) Youth -Based Sexual Education Author: Nick Winges -Yanez and Kris Gowen, PhD Abstract: In 2009, Oregon passed Oregon Administrativ e Rule 581 -022-1440, one of the most nationally progressive laws regarding sexual education. This rule states sexual education in Oregon must not just be comprehensive, by addressing both abstinence and other forms of pregnancy and STI prevention, but also culturally sensitive, and 83 inclusive of all sexual orientations and gender roles. The proposed study utilized 4 focus groups to obtain the perspectives of LGBTQ youth as to what inclusive sexual education entails. This was an exploratory study since there is no known published research about how LGBTQ youth perceive sexual education and what it means for them for such education to be inclusive. Results of this project will be used to help create a report for statewide educators and other stakeholders to pro vide guidance as to how to teach sexual education inclusive of LGBTQ youth. The report will also guide local trainings on LGBTQ inclusiveness which are currently being piloted in Oregon. This report will be part of a larger project, Working to Institutiona lize Sexuality Education (WISE) in Oregon. The goal of this project, funded by the Grove/Packard Foundation, is to help support Oregon school districts implement the new sexual education laws described above. Objective: To gain a better understanding of qu eer youth needs regarding \"inclusive\" school based comprehensive sex education.

Schary, M.S. Abstract: Despite its known health benefits, physical activity (PA) steadily decreases from adolescents to adulthood (Nelson, Gortmaker, Subramanian, & Wechsler, 2007). The American College Health Association (2006) reports that less tha n half of all college students meet the minimum recommended PA requirements. However, college students are a unique population. Because many are living independently for the first time, it marks an important life transition point. In particular, behavioral patterns developed during the college years are reflective of future physical activity behavior (Brynteson & Adams, 1993). Therefore, placing students on a positive physical activity trajectory is of the utmost in importance. The servant leadership model (SLM) provides a practical framework to assist health professionals (e.g., educators, instructors, medical personnel) in connecting and inspiring sedentary students to become active. SLM's foundations of humility, empowerment, and authenticity help leaders form relationships that inspire individuals to autonomous, enduring, and positive behavioral changes. For example, previous research has shown that servant leader behaviors positively effect intrinsic motivation, psychological satisfaction, and task -goal orientation among followers (Van Dierendonck, In Press; Hammermeister et al., 2008). 84 Since the SLM is new to the health and exercise fields, this presentation will: (1) introduce the model, (2) describe previous and current research, and (3) explain the benefits to health professionals serving college or university students. Objective: 1. Understand the Servant Leadership Model's application to and benefits to physical activity 2.

Bean, M.P.H. Abstract: Background: Anti -vaccination websites appeal to persons searching the Internet for vaccine information that reinforces their predilection to avoid vaccination for themselves or their children. Few published studies have systematically examined these sites. Purpose: The aim of this study was to employ content analysis as a useful tool for examining and com - paring anti -vaccination websites for recurring and changing emphases in content, design, and credibility themes since earlier anti - vaccination website co ntent analyses were conducted. Methods: Between February and May 2010, using a commonly available search engine followed by a deep web search, 25 websites that contained anti -vaccination content were reviewed and analyzed for 24 content, 14 design, and 13 credibility attributes. Results: Although several content claims remained similar to earlier analyses, two new themes emerged: (1) the 2009 H1N1epidemic threat was manufactured, and (2) the increasing presence of so -called expert testimony in opposing vacc ination. Conclusion: Anti -vaccination websites are constantly changing in response to the trends in public health and the success of vaccination. Monitoring changes can permit public health workers to mount programs more quickly to counter the opposition a rguments. Additionally, opposition claims commonly appeal to emotions whereas the supporting claims appeal to reason. Effective vaccine support may be better served by including more emotionally compelling content. Objective: Participants will gain a clea rer understanding of the dynamic nature of websites, the pitfalls of webs searching for credible information, and will receive a checklist to use assessing website credibility criteria.

As part of Oregon's Action Plan for Health, the state of Orego n seeks to set standards for safe and effective care. To accomplish this, the state is developing 10 sets of guidelines that can be uniformly applied across public and private health care to drive down costs and reduce unnecessary care. Areas involving hig h utilization, high cost and high practice variation were identified including: advanced imaging for low back pain, joint replacements; spinal injections; and preventable hospital readmissions. A systematic evidence search will be completed for each topic and high quality guidelines will be adopted, modified or merged as appropriate. When evidence -based guidelines are unavailable, guidelines based on best -practices will be developed. A clinical advisory panel will be created for each topic, serving as an ex pert peer review. Public input is being solicited through the Health Services Commission. The guidelines will be disseminated statewide to plans, providers, and the public. Through the adoption of these guidelines by both public and private payers, more patients will receive appropriate, effective care, health care quality will improve, and costs will go down, furthering Oregon's Triple Aim objectives. Objective: 1) Identify high areas of spending and variation in health care 2) Describe a process for deve loping evidence -based guidelines 3) Understand the potential improvements in health care quality and costs with the adoption of statewide clinical guidelines Presentation Type: Oral (10 - 15 minutes) A-V Needs: None indicated Name: Cat Livingston Degrees: MD Title: Organization/Affiliation: Health Services Commission, Oregon Health Authority Address: 1225 Ferry Street, Suite C Salem Co-Presenter 2: Dave Pass, MD david.pass@state.or.us Co-Presenter 3: Alison Little, MD, MPH littleal@ohsu.edu Co-Presenter 4: Valerie King MD, MPH kingv@ohsu.edu Co-Presenter 5: Jeanene Smith, MD, MPH jeanene.smith@state.or.us Topic: Adolescent HIV/STI prevention Title: Do urban African American youth use the Internet for sexual health information? Author: M. Margaret Dolcini, PhD, Joseph Catania, PhD, Senna L. Towner, MS, Kimberly Ric hards, PhD, MA1, Gary W. Harper, Ph.D., MPH Abstract: Background: The Internet is a growing resource for sexual health information. Middle -class youth use the Internet, but little is known about use among low SES urban African American youth. Methods: Usin g qualitative methods, we 89 examined Internet use among 82 African Americans (aged 15 -17) living in high -risk neighborhoods in two US cities. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and coded. Results: The majority of adolescents use the Internet, b ut little use is focused on sexual health. Females are more positive about the Internet and use it more frequently for sexual health than do males (38% vs. 27%, respectively). Youth who use the Internet for sexual health information report limited related use. Discussion: Findings point to differences in Internet use as a resource for sexual health information across gender and between middle -class and low SES youth. Urban African American youth may not know how to access information, or their access to Int ernet sexual health sites may be blocked (e.g., at school). Future STI/HIV interventions for urban African Americans should identify and decrease barriers to legitimate sexual health sites. Many adolescents use the Internet; therefore, interventions that i dentify barriers and make use of the Internet to disseminate sexual health information may be successful. Objective: 1) Determine urban African American youths\u00bf use of the Internet. 2) Identify African American low SES urban adolescents' use of the Intern et for sexual health information. 3) Demonstrate gender differences in Internet use. 4) Describe the importance of integrating the Internet as an STI/HIV prevention tool.

College students (N= 1366, age=21.7\u00b14.1, Greek members=14.5%) from a la rge university in Oregon participated in the study. Self -report data were collected through the American College Health Association Assessment - National College Health Assessment in 2010. Results indicated that 1) Greek members were more likely to use alcoh ol and to binge drinking than non -Greek members.2) Greek members were more likely to have negative drinking consequences (e.g. unprotected sex) than non -Greek members. 3) Greek member were less likely to use preventive practice of drinking, such as avoidin g drinking games, and more likely to use preventive practice such as eat before and/or during drinking. Gender differences were also reported. Overall results indicated that Greek members in college have higher risk of binge drinking, negative drinking con sequences, and less preventive practice than that of non -Greek members. Greek members in college may need future intervention about alcohol use. Objective: 1. Understand Greek Organization members' behaviors and consequences specifically related to the con sumption of alcohol. 2. Discuss implications of findings and prevention strategies with target population. Presentation Type: Panel Presentation 91 Panel Abstract1: The study compared the drinking behavior between Greek and non - Greek members among college st udents. College students (N= 1366, age=21.7\u00b14.1, Greek members=14.5%) from a large university in Oregon participated in the study. Self-report data were collected through the American College Health Association Assessment -National College Health Assessment in 2010. Alcohol usage was measured by asking how many days did you use alcohol within last 30 days. Binge drinking is defined as having five or more drinks of alcohol at a setting one or more time in the past two weeks. Results indicated that 36.5% and 1 6.0% of female Greek members and non - members used alcohol more than 10 days in the last 30 days, respectively. 38.8% and 23.9% of male Greek members and non -members used alcohol more than 10 days in the last 30 days, respectively. For females, 53.9% of Gre ek members were binge drinkers, while 38.8% of non -members were. For males, 77.3% of Greek members were binge drinkers and 55.4% of non members were. Chi -square tests revealed that for both males and females, Greek members were more likely to use alcohol a nd to binge drinking than non-Greek members (p<0.01, p<0.01, respectively). Panel Abstract2: The study compared the consequences of drinking between Greek and non -Greek members among college students. College students (N= 1366, age=21.7\u00b14.1, Greek members =14.5%) from a large university in Oregon participated in the study. Self -report data were collected through the American College Health Association Assessment -National College Health Assessment in 2010. Consequences of drinking were measured by asking \u00bfwi thin the last 12 months, have you experienced any of the following as a consequence of your drinking?\u00bf The consequences included: forgetting things, having unprotected sex or sex without giving or getting consent, got in trouble with police, physically inj ured self or others, and seriously considered suicide. Logistic regression results indicated that male Greek members were more likely to have negative drinking consequences than male non -Greek members from doing something you later regretted, odds ratio (OR)=2.5 (IC=1.4 -3.7), forgot where you were and what you did, OR=2.9(IC=2.3 -5.9), had sex with someone without giving your consent, OR=3.8(IC=1.3 -11.8), have unprotected sex, OR=1.8 (IC=1.1 -3.1), and physically injured yourself, OR=3.6, (IC=2.1 -5.9). For females, results showed that Greek members were more likely to have consequences of drinking in the following categories: doing something you later regretted, OR=2.3(IC=1.6 -3.7), forgot where you were and what you did, OR=3.7(IC=1.8 -4.4), and physically injured yourself, OR=1.9, (IC=1.2 - 3.2), compared to female non -Greek members. Panel Abstract3: The current study examined the preventive practice of drinking behavior between Greek and non -Greek members among college students. College student s (N= 1366, age=21.7\u00b14.1, Greek members=14.5%) from a large university in Oregon participated in the study. Self -report data were collected through the American College Health Association Assessment -National College Health Assessment in 2010. Preventive pr actice included, for example, avoiding drinking games, having a friend let you know when you have had enough, using a designed driver, and so on. Participants responded based on the frequency from do not drink', to never' to always'. Participants were d efined as having preventive practice if they responded to a preventive behavior most of the time' or always'. Chi -square results indicated that for males, Greek members were less likely to have preventive behaviors than non -members including avoid drink ing games', or pace your drinks to 1 or fewer per hour'. Greek members were more likely to eat before and/or during drinking and use a designated driver than 92 non-members. For females, Greek members were less likely to have preventive behaviors than non -members including avoiding drinking games, and choosing not to drink alcohol. Greek members were more likely to eat before and/or during drinking, keep track of how many drinks they were having, and using a designated driver than non-members (all p values <0 .05).

This chronic disease is presenting in epidemic proportions. The public health community locally, nationa lly, and internationally should increase efforts in controlling this epidemic. Epidemiological research reveals an unusually high prevalence of diabetes in Native American, Alaskan Inuit, and Indigenous Australian populations. Our research sought to develo p an understanding for these disparities and propose an appropriate prevention program. Diabetes presents an economic burden to the population, but can be prevented in a cost - effective manner. We have identified correlated links, including socioeconomic cl ass and cultural influences, for disparities in prevalence. A critical evaluation of the current preventative measures and policies targeted at diabetes in the United States has revealed gaps in community efforts. Our health development proposal will fill these voids. Recognizing the potential impact of a diabetes health development program, we have designed an approach to target the native/indigenous populations. Objective: Identify and asses the reasons for diabetes hot -spots'. Analyze the economic impl ications of diabetes on health systems.

To avoid transmission of these pathogens, programs for standardized environmental cleaning need to be established. Purpose: The present study set out to evaluate LTCF environmental cleaning practices to decrease the possibility of disease transmission. Methods: A total of 15 standardized high touch objects (HTO) in resident rooms and shared areas were confidentially marked with an invisible fluorescent targeting method. After at least one daily cleaning, rooms were evaluated using a hand -held black light to determine if HTO's were cleaned. Results were given to the Environmental Cleaning (EC) employees and barriers to cleaning were discussed. Another audit was done at 1 week after EC education and again within another 2 months. Outcomes: Th e project results showed that at baseline 332 of 1,240 HTO's (27%) showed evidence of cleaning. A statistically significant increase (p<.01) was seen after educational interventions with 612 of 964 (63%) HTO's showing evidence of cleaning. The audits conti nued to show significant improvements (p=.03) with the 2nd follow -up audit resulting in 519 of 652 (80%) HTO's with evidence of cleaning. Conclusion: Sustained improvements in LTCF cleaning were seen with a standardized approach to cleaning. Feedback to EC staff was integral to improving outcomes. Objective: Assessing environmental cleaning in LTCF using a standardized cleaning protocol. Presentation Type: illness in Oregon Title: Associations between Brand X Chicken and Human C ases of Salmonella heidelberg in Oregon Author: Steven Fiala, Hillary Booth and Emilio DeBess Abstract: Background: Each year, Salmonella infections associated with poultry 94 consumption cost an estimated $712 million and 3,610 quality life years. The USDA classifies Salmonella as a legal adulterant in raw chicken unless associated with an outbreak of illness. In Oregon, Salmonella heidelberg Pattern A (ShPA) has been implicated in an ongoing cluster of human illness since 2003. This pattern has concurrently been isolated in retail chicken tested through the National Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring System; these chicken isolates are primarily Brand X. Methods: We calculated odds ratios to determine the association between ShPA and Brand X chicken. Salmonella heidelberg Pattern A identified in humans and retail chicken were plotted to visualize temporal clustering. Results: Chicken isolates positive for ShPA are 21 times more likely to be Brand X than any other brand of chicken tested. In addition, there is a strong temporal association between ShPA human cases and Brand X isolates positive for ShPA. Discussion: Preliminary analysis suggests an association between ShPA human cases and Brand X chicken. Health departments should actively identify sources of Salmo nella exposure and educate the public about poultry -associated infections. A case -control study was initiated in June 2011 to further evaluate the relationship between human and Brand X ShPA isolates. Objective: Participants will be able to: 1. Discuss the potential association between human cases of S. heidelberg and Brand X chicken. 2. Describe the temporal trend in human cases and retail chicken positive for the S. heidelberg pattern of interest.

Morris Abstract: Background: The American Lung Association warns that hookah is the first new tobacco trend of the 21st century. Despite widespread misconceptions to the contrary, hookah smoke contains toxins and is associated with many of the same diseases as cigarette smoke. Youth hookah use in Oregon is on the rise, part icularly in counties containing hookah lounges. To inform tobacco control efforts in Oregon, we wanted to know more about the appeal of hookah and hookah lounges to youth and young adults. Methods: We conducted focus groups with young hookah smokers and non-smokers. We also assessed hookah lounges in Oregon to describe the lounge environment, customer profiles, and promotional activities. Results: Hookah's appeal to youth stems from widespread peer acceptance of hookah use, the flavored, sweet -tasting tobac co smoke, and misperceptions that hookah is not harmful to health. Discussion: Many of the policies that have reduced youth initiation of cigarette smoking can be applied to hookah. Public education is needed to inform youth and adults about the 95 dangers of hookah use, including warning labels on hookah tobacco. Flavors in hookah tobacco should be prohibited, and the tax rate on hookah tobacco should be made equivalent to the tax on cigarettes. Smoke -free workplace laws should prohibit smoking lounges. Obje ctive: Participants will be able to: 1. Describe the rising prevalence of hookah smoking in youth 2. Discuss the appeal of hookah and hookah lounges to youth 3. Identify policy interventions to curb youth hookah use Presentation Type: Poster Name: Steven Fiala Degrees: MPH Title: Research Analyst Organization/Affiliation: Oregon Health Authority Address: 800 NE Oregon St, Ste Portland exposure incidence trend from 1995 through 2010 Title: Longitudinal trends in pyrethroid exposures reported to the National Pesticide Information Center, 1995 -2010 Author: Rusha Tapadar and Dave Stone, PhD Abstract: Background: Pyrethroids are one of the most common ingredients registered for residential uses. This is particularly true since the phase -out of two popular organophosphates, chlorpyrifos and diazinon, for public availability. The National Pestici de Information Center (NPIC) at Oregon State University receives thousands of pesticide incident reports from the public and professionals each year. The objective of this study was to examine trends in pyrethroid incident reporting over time for both peop le and animals. Method: In this study, we queried NPIC incidence data from 1995 - 2010 for twenty -five different pyrethroid active ingredients. Incidents were stratified by human or animal. Only incidents that were classified as definitely, probably or possi bly related to pyrethroid exposure were included in analysis. Results: We noted an increase in the reporting of pyrethroid incidents in both people and animals over the timeframe of interest. This was particularly evident during the period after chlorpyrif os and diazinon were phased out of residential use. We also noted a difference between humans and animals in the types of pyrethroid active ingredients involved with the majority of exposure incidents. Human incident data revealed that the majority of inci dents involved deltamethrin and permethrin, and to a lesser extent, bifenthrin and cyfluthrin. For animals, the major pyrethroids reported in incidents were permethrin and cyphenothrin. Conclusion: Over time, pyrethroid incidents reported to NPIC for both humans and animals has increased over time, which may be the result of phasing -out diazinon and chlorpyrifos from residential use. Objective: Learning Objective: Longitudinal trends in pyrethroid exposures reported to the National Pesticide Information Ce nter, 1995 -2010. We also intend to learn how the type of pyrethroids differ between human and animal incidence data and what could 96 be the possible reason behind rise in pyrethroid exposure.

The soluble protein encoded by the HER -2/neu proto -oncogene has been proposed to be used as a clinical tool for prognosis in mammary cancer due to its predictive value. Moreover, studies have also shown that the predictive information g ained from this biomarker might also apply to other cancers, including lung cancer. The present study reports on the prognostic role in lung cancer patients of the soluble HER -2 biomarker. 97 Survival analysis methodology, including Kaplan -Meier curves, log -rank tests, and proportional hazards regression analysis, will delineate the survival prospects of non - small cell lung cancer patients with high versus low values of soluble HER -2. The current study of soluble HER -2 as a prognosticator of lung cancer (i.e., predictor of survival) will be followed by future work on testing soluble HER -2 as a theragnosticator of HER -2 directed therapies in lung cancer. Objective: Determine the potential prognostic value of soluble HER -2 for Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer patients . Understand the implementation of survival analysis with censored data. Illustrate the value of biomarker data to monitor disease progression.

The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, like many other Nati ve Americans, may be at a higher risk for exposure to PAHs from inhalation of smoke during the smoking of fish and game using traditional practices, and from ingestion of smoked foods. In local tribal communities, smoked fish and game constitutes an import ant proportion of their diet and plays a major role in their culture and development. The present study describes the traditional smoking practices of salmon in two different structures, a tipi and a wood shed, and using two different types of wood. Two ma in exposure pathways are evaluated utilizing urine samples and personal air samplers to best characterized the degree of human exposure during the smoking events. Traditional smoking practices will be described along with the use of modern metrics to quant ify exposure. Preliminary data from the personal air sampler and the urine samples will be presented as it becomes available. Objective: Identify major exposure pathways for Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). Describe traditional smoking practices u tilized by one Native American tribe. Explain the process for quantitatively estimating possible exposures from inhalation and ingestion pathways.

Abstract: Nanotechnology (or nanotech) is the study of manipulating atomic and molecular scale matter with the aim of a chieving something new and useful. At the nanometer scale, one billionth of a meter, materials typically display properties uniquely different from those observed with macromaterials. Consequently, nanotechnologies promise many societal benefits ranging fr om modest consumer product improvements to revolutionary changes in medicine and energy production. However, the same properties that enable novel applications may also lead to negative environment, health and safety (EHS) consequences. These novel propert ies, coupled with a relative scarcity of information on nanomaterial hazards, make risk assessment and regulation a difficult task. With over a thousand nano -enabled products currently in the marketplace, and billions invested in future technologies, the n ecessity and demand for nanotechnology EHS (nanoEHS) education cannot be overstated. As a result, we have partnered with ASTM International to develop the first nanoEHS personnel certification program. The aim of the program is to present a comprehensive r eview of current nanoEHS knowledge and issues while providing resources for gaining insight and timely updates on developments. The program will provide legislators, EHS officers, safety professionals, students, and others in the imminent nanotech workforc e the foundational education critical to a paradigm shift away from post -implementation reaction toward proactive life cycle management. Objective: (1) Explain how the properties of nanomaterials differ from their bulk or molecular counterparts. (2) In reg ards to the environment and to health, provide examples of how nanotechnology may positively and negatively impact society. (3) Identify available informatics resources and tools that support nanotechnology and nanoEHS research and describe their uses and limitations.

Abstract: The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has adversely impacted communities living in coastal communities along the Gulf Coast states. These communities may be at increased risk of disease due to elevated exposures to a wide range of contaminants associated with crude oil and its break down products. Potential contaminants of particular interest are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs). This National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) funded research project, a collaboration between the Oregon State University Superfund Research Program (SRP) and Environmental Health Sciences Center (EHSC), seeks to provide pertinent PAH -related outreach education to the diverse communities impacted by the spill. This presentation reports on three aspects of the project: (1) Identify the potential health effects from exposure to PAHs from the crude oil spill; (2) Innovative passive sampling devices (PSDs) that mimic cellular membranes and absorb the bioavailable fraction of certain chemicals; (3) Stepwise approaches to outreach from a dis tance including developing an educational brochure for gulf sampling locations, relationships with local and regional partners to identify educational and professional development needs, and novel outreach methods including websites, webinars, content anim ation, and podcasts. Objective: (1) Identify the potential health effects of exposure to PAHs found in the oil spill (2) Describe what a passive sampling device (PSD) is and how it works. (3) Illustrate the evolution, and strategies in development, of long distance outreach.

The survey data was recoded and then analyzed using logistic regression where depressive symptoms were the main outcome and maternal nativity was the main predictor. SES, race and Hispanic ethnicity were also considered in the model as possible confounders. I found that foreign birth was a protective factor against depressive symptoms in this survey and that African American women, women on Medicaid, and women of Hispanic ethnicity were at higher risk of depressive symptom s. In conclusion, all women should be informed about maternal depression, and more extensive and affordable mental health services should be made available to women of minorities living in difficult economic situations to lower maternal depressive symptoms . Objective: 1. Determine whether maternal nativity is associated with maternal depressive symptoms. 2. Determine whether maternal race is associated with maternal depressive symptoms.

Rosenberg, MD, MPH Abstract: Objective: Women who retain pregnancy weight gain are at increased risk of diabetes an d other health problems. Methods: The Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is a stratified, population -based survey of women who have recently given birth. The PRAMS respondents receive a follow -back survey (PRAMS -2) shortly after the ir child's second birthday. Physical activity was defined as engaging in at least 30 minutes of physical activity at least once a week. Significant weight retention was defined as retaining more than 5kg, calculated by subtracting the pre-pregnancy weight reported in PRAMS from the weight reported in PRAMS -2. Multivariate logistic regression in Stata was used for the analysis. Results: 79.4% of respondents reported partaking in 30 minutes of physical activity at least once a week in the month prior respondi ng to the PRAMS -2 survey. 32.3% of women retained more than 5 kg (~11 lbs) from a previous pregnancy. Overall, women who engaged in at least one day of physical exercise per week were less likely to retain pregnancy weight (adjusted odds ratio: 1.73; 95% c onfidence interval: 1.04 -2.86), after controlling for parity. Conclusions: Engaging in at least 30 minutes of physical activity at least once a week is significantly/non -significantly associated with less retention of pregnancy weight gain. The next step i s intervention studies in which women with various levels of pregnancy weight gain are offered support for physical activity to ascertain whether 101 those exercise are more likely to lose their pregnancy weight gain over a period of years. Objective: To info rm the viewer of the association between physical exercise and postpartum weight retention.

Title: Understanding prevention of chronic kidney disease in at -risk youth: Examination of the Multicultural Integrated Kidney Education (MIKE) Program Author: Nichole D. Sage Daniel J. Munoz Susan T. Li Cheryl Neal Abstract: Background/Purpose: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing national 102 problem (Coresh et al., 2003). Poor health increases risk for CKD (Fox et al., 2004); thus, targeting the reduction of problematic health beha viors in youth may prevent the onset of CKD. Evidence suggests several school -based health education programs (SBHEP) are effective in reducing various health -risk behaviors (Collins et al., 2002); however, few studies have focused on preventing kidney dis ease, specifically. Moreover, services targeted to ethnic minority populations are needed given the reported racial disparities in rates of CKD (Tarver -Carr et al., 2002). The Multicultural Integrated Kidney Education (MIKE) Program is a SBHEP designed to promote healthy behaviors and increase self -efficacy to prevent later kidney problems while emphasizing service delivery to at -risk populations. Methods: Literature addressing the prevention of kidney disease with youth is reviewed to identify key componen ts necessary to address the public health problem of CKD. Programmatic aspects of the MIKE Program are introduced and linked to objectives and needs identified in the literature. Implications: There is a growing need for programs to address the public heal th problem of CKD. MIKE Program has the potential to meet this unique need for health education services for at -risk youth. Objective: Attendees will learn key concepts identified in the literature related to the prevention of CKD and how MIKE Program is designed to meet those objectives.

The Roadmap to Healthy Communities is designed to help residents improve their health and quality of life. Methods: Roadmap gathered county resident health concern data and resident ideas on improving community health. Results: Ideas and concerns about community health and its improvement were gathered from 13 community group interviews and 1,000 resident surveys. 22 Roadmap community advisers and CCCH staff members then reported their assessment and recommendations. This report promp ted the BCC to provide $100,000 to CCCH to develop solutions. CCCH requested proposals from community groups and offered to fund small projects that improve access to healthy foods and physical fitness 103 opportunities. 13 community groups were awarded sums b etween $2,600 and $8,000. Projects include: walking trails; community gardens, including some at schools; nutrition education; cycling fitness and education. Conclusions: Most projects have not reached their mid -point. The CREST mid -term report states tha t students' fresh vegetable consumption has risen markedly. The Oregon City Farmers Market's Power of Produce Kids Club has produced large increases in the number of 5 -12 year -olds purchasing Market produce. Objective: Participants will learn the lessons of the community engagement process to improve health and quality of life within Clackamas County. Presentation Type: Poster Name: Mike Holmes Degrees: BS Title: Compliance Organization/Affiliation: Clackamas County Community Health Address: to enhance STD/HIV surveillance Indian/Alaska Native population Author: Megan Hoopes, MPH; Abstract: Background: American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are frequently undercounted in disease surveillance systems. To the extent that this popula tion is racially misclassified in STD/HIV surveillance data, public health disease control efforts may by hampered. Methods: We evaluated race coding in Oregon's STD/HIV registry, 2000 -2009, using probabilistic record linkage to Indian Health Service patie nt enrollment records. Using linkage -corrected race data, we examined STD and HIV incidence and prevalence rates for AI/ANs compared to all other races combined. Results: Record linkage increased AI/AN -identified STDs by 48%. Of 959 cases newly identified as AI/AN, 70% were previously coded as White and 20.5% as unknown or missing race. The correction of AI/AN race resulted in significantly higher average annual incidence rate estimates for chlamydia (from 263.8 to 386.6 per 100,000) and gonorrhea (from 25. 3 to 39.2). HIV prevalence increased from 11.4 to 19.6 per 100,000. Rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea for AI/AN females were approximately 50% higher than corresponding disease -specific rates for females of all other races; rates among AI/AN males were simi lar to other races. Conclusions: The correct classification of race is an important factor in disease surveillance. These methods may be expanded to increase the quality of health data for AI/AN, informing prevention, intervention, and funding. Objective: Attendees will understand how racial misclassification can affect STD/HIV morbidity estimates for the American Indian/Alaska Native population.

Substandard housing is related to a variety of public health issues and using the socio -ecological model (which addresses any public health issue on multiple levels: individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public polic y) leads to the identification and mitigation of multiple environmental health problems. Asthma morbidity is directly related to environmental health triggers in homes, which tend to be more prevalent in substandard housing. At the individual and interpers onal level, we are working with families to empower them to take greater control over their individual home environments and making connections between health and the environment. By addressing housing code and enforcement, we are working at a public polic y level to identify gaps in protections, and by looking at education and empowerment of residents, while also improving relationships between landlords and tenants, the model creates conditions by which community members can speak for themselves, under a p remise that a \"community that speaks for itself, can best protect itself. Some of the results from our Healthy Homes and Housing programs include but are not limited to: 1. Increased understanding of the ways that housing influences health outcomes. 2. Gr eater asthma control and reduced ER visits for clients using Multnomah County Health Homes Services. 3. Increased enforcement of housing codes and greater protections for low -income renters. 4. Delivery of empowering education and health promotion to resid ents of affordable housing. The data analysis and findings of these various initiatives are used to form public health policy. Objective: Learn and understand how the Socio -ecological model can be used to address public health disparities.

The se infections are also known as hospital acquired infections. One of the main modes of transmission is through medical staff and hospital visitors, who unintentionally infect patients. The current research shows that this is highly preventable if correct h ygiene procedures and guidelines are followed, especially concerning hand hygiene. We theorized that if hand sanitizer stations are set up all around a hospital, it will reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections. In order to determine the efficacy of h and sanitizers we analyzed various studies and publications to develop an evidence -based conclusion. Our literature review consisted of data collected from various sources. Our first conclusion is that there are various important guidelines and legislative actions that cover hand hygiene. The next step was to consider the current policy and examine a range of examples of hospitals that have implemented hand hygiene programs or installed hand sanitizer stations. This was also conducted through another review of the relevant sources. We concluded that hand sanitizer is equally as effective as hand washing, based on available research. Our key finding was that placing hand sanitizer stations in a hospital will only reduce nosocomial infections if hospitals also increase compliance in the staff. We utilized theoretical reasoning from the fields of human behavior, psychology and economics to develop ideas for cost effective interventions that will be successful based on the evidence. We also present several ways t o increase hand hygiene compliance. We recommend that hospital administration fund these types of programs to reduce nosocomial infections. Objective: Conceptualize, analyze, and resolve problems related to health services delivery and finance; Establish and manage systems and processes to assess organizational performance for continuous improvement of quality, safety, and effectiveness; Lead in all levels of public and private health services organizations; Communicate, solve problems and make decisions r elated to health policy and management in the public and private sectors.

The Nation al Science Foundation predicts the period from 2011 -2020 will result in fundamentally new products based on nanomaterials. These chemical biophysical nanometer scale (i.e., 1 x 10 -9 meters) materials may bring new or increased hazard to humans and the envi ronment, and the uncertainty surrounding their risk to biological and environmental health needs to be investigated. Health risk can be defined as a function of hazard and exposure, and an understanding of the hazard and exposure of these materials is impo rtant in order to minimize health risk. Products utilizing nanoscale materials will become ubiquitous throughout commerce in the coming years and regulatory oversight and reporting in the EU and the US is moving forward. The development of the zebrafish (D anio rerio) model for rapid material testing bridges a gap in toxicology testing between in vitro cell culture models and in vivo mammalian models. The anatomy, physiology, and genomics of the zebrafish are highly homologous to humans, and these similariti es are just beginning to be exploited by research communities. Being a whole animal vertebrate organism, zebrafish allow for great flexibility in conducting experimental assays to identify nanomaterial exposure effects in morphology, physiology, behavior, and distribution. This research presents an overview of the issues surrounding nanomaterial health risk and provides testing results in order to demonstrate the utility of the zebrafish model in answering nanomaterial biocompatibility research questions.

Abstract: Background/purpose: The fatality r ate in the Northwest Dungeness crab fleet is 463 deaths per 100,000 full -time workers. This fatality rate is 4 times the national average for all commercial fishing and over 100 times the general fatality rate for all workers. Over 7 years, 2003 -2009, the Oregon Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (OR -FACE) program recorded 14 worker fatalities in 8 incidents involving crab boats along the Oregon Coast. Two risk factors stand out in the Oregon incidents: none of the victims wore a personal flotation device (PFD) or a survival suit when they entered the water and all the capsized crab fishing boats were small vessels (below 79 feet). Methods: Our team surveyed 83 fishermen in Newport, OR, regarding five areas of concern: (a) bar crossings, (b) PFD use, (c) vessel stability reports, (d) US Coast Guard dockside examinations, and (e) safety training and readiness. The questionnaire included multiple -choice, Likert -scale items, and several open -ended questions. The survey consisted of 34 total questions for crewmembers and an extended survey of 46 questions for the captains. Results: The results provide a view of this population's behavior and beliefs relative to critical safety issues. Implications: The results of this study will help evaluate current safet y initiatives and training programs and provide feedback for policymakers and the industry considering additional safety measures. Objective: A review of applied research methods. Presentation Phone: 503.494.2281 Email1: Topic: in Homes Author: Jeanne Brandt Abstract: Oregon's damp, temperate climate creates the ideal environment for mold growth in homes and other buildings. Molds have the potential to cause health problems. They produce allergens, irritants, and in some cases, potentially toxic substances (mycotoxins) (U.S.E.P.A., 20 11). They are a major asthma trigger. Asthma prevalence in Oregon continues to rise and is higher that the U.S. average. (O.H.A., 2010). Mold growth can cause serious damage to personal belongings, carpets and furnishings and the structural elements in hom es and buildings. (U.S.E.P.A., 2011). There is an abundance of misinformation available from many sources. Public health professionals are often called upon to respond to questions about indoor air quality, damp environments and the resulting mold. This po ster will provide basic information 108 and reliable references and resources relating to this issue. Objective: 1. Provide current, unbiased, research based information for professionals and consumers related to the health effects of exposure to mold and how to prevent, identify and address mold issues. 2.

This data will help track and better understand where PHNs work, their skills and needs for professional development. Surveys were sent out to 109 public health nurses in local and state health departments, schools of nursing, school nurses and professional organizations. A total of 350 surveys were received from September 2010 through March 2011 with 246 of the respondents from local health departments. Of the sample, 93% were white, with an average age of 52.5. The majority of respondents were registered nurses (336). There are 54% of PHNs in Oregon who will retire in the next 9 years. The top four areas where participants were willingly and needing to improve skills were: 1) population based practice and interventions, 2) electronic health records, 3) communicable diseases and 4) mental health. The implications for use of these survey results can be envisioned in efforts to build the PHN workforce, achieve competencies and improve educational attainment to assure nurses are prepared to practice to their full skills and poten tial. Plans for follow up study are underway.

Objectives were to test 3 child health policy aims in the largest local school district. The school district is racially -diverse, low -income, and rural, with high childhood obesity rates. PATCH objectives were 3 -fold: To test perception and utility of the district's BMI notification letter by parents and students; to test the impact of menu -labeling on calorie intake at the district's midd le school; and to test the impact of reversing order of recess (RR) on nutritional intake and behavior in a K -2 school. PATCH employed mixed methods including qualitative and quantitative measures. Participants included students grades K -12, parents, and s chool staff. PATCH findings included broad parent and student support for BMI collection and notification, but limited understanding of the measure itself. Menu labeling analysis revealed a decrease of 47 calories consumed per day (P=0.0040) and 2.1 grams of fat consumed per day (P=0.0025). Students varied in their use of the calorie label information. Recess before lunch intervention groups consumed more milk and therefore calcium, as well as behavior and learning were improved in RR students. Policy recom mendations are strong for menu -labeling in upper grades. School Board is currently in consideration. Objective: Participants will be able to: State the 3 policy aims in the PATCH project, and findings and recommendations associated with each aim.

This is the fi rst full -scale trial to evaluate the dose -response of spinal manipulation for any condition. Methods: We randomized 400 patients with chronic LBP to one of four levels of care: 0, 6, 12, or 18 sessions of spinal manipulation from a chiropractor. Participan ts were scheduled for three visits per week for six weeks at one of nine clinics. Care was either the index intervention or light massage to control attention and \"hands on.\" Primary outcomes were LBP intensity and functional disability measured at 6, 12, 18, 24 weeks. Secondary outcome were days with pain and disability, pain unpleasantness, and EuroQual health state. Linear dose effects and comparisons of manipulation to massage group means were evaluated using covariate -adjusted simultaneous regression. Results: There was clinically important improvement in all groups persistent to 24 weeks. There were small linear dose effects for the primary outcomes at 12 weeks (p < .02) disappearing by 24 weeks; 12 manipulation sessions were modestly superior to none (P < .01). Conclusions: Twelve visits was the optimal dose for spinal manipulation. Funded by NCCAM/NIH (U01 AT001908). Objective: Discuss dose -response of spinal manipulation for the care of low back pain.

Bovbjerg, MPH, PhD and Kenneth D. Rosenberg, MD, MPH Abstract: Introduction: Uptake and maintenance of breastfeeding has important health benefits for newborns. We studied risk factors for breastfeeding le ss than 4 weeks. Methods: Oregon PRAMS (Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System) 112 interviews a stratified random sample of Oregon women 3 -4 months after a live birth. 3845 women who had a baby in 2006 -2007 reported a variety of factors that might be associated with breastfeeding for less than 4 weeks. Forward stepwise logistic regression identified nine statistically significant predictors. These unweighted analyses will be presented as weighted results at the conference. Results: Mothers who smoked, wer e depressed, received baby formula gift packs, used pacifiers in the hospital, and received breastfeeding information in the hospital were less likely than others to breastfeed for more than four weeks. Mothers who were married, received a breastfeeding he lp phone number, breastfed in the hospital, and fed only breast milk in the hospital were more likely than others to breastfeed for more than four weeks. Conclusion: Mothers should be encouraged to stop smoking during and after pregnancy. Mothers should re ceive optimal support for breastfeeding during and after delivery including feeding only breast milk, not using a pacifier and not receiving a gift pack containing infant formula. Objective: 1. Help promote longer breastfeeding by addressing mothers with i dentified risk factors for breastfeeding less than four weeks. 2. Help achieve Healthy People 2020 breastfeeding objectives.

Many of the counties are rural or frontier, but the region also includes two large metropolitan areas. Specific examples from these diverse communities demonstrate how the history of public health systems in six Northwest states shapes present and future public he alth systems. As part of its 20th anniversary celebration, Northwest Center for Public Health Practice (NWCPHP) celebrated the many public health accomplishments of the region with a monthly postcard series, then & now. The postcards demonstrate public hea lth's versatility and progress. This year -long series was the most celebrated 20th anniversary activity, resulting in comments from practitioners throughout the region. Some postcards also worked as a launching ground for further discussion and collaborati on among regional public health professionals. We heard many times how wonderful it was to read about the positive and productive work taking place around the Northwest. The series was so successful NWCPHP made the series available as posters and is contin uing a similar regional highlight series beyond our 20th anniversary celebration. NWCPHP is proud to provide training, research and evaluation for outstanding public health 113 professionals. Objective: 1. Explore the basic unchanged fundamentals that guide c urrent public health practice 2.

Unfortunately, fewer than 50% of those diagnosed with diabetes receive annual eye exams. PURPOSE: The framework of the Health Belief Model was used to develop the Compliance with Annual Diabetic Eye Examination Survey (CADEES), an instrument designed to identify the fac tors related to adherence with yearly eye exams. METHODS: Interviewers administered the 45 -item survey to 100 diabetic patients. Participants rated the extent to which they agreed with each statement using a Likert scale. We also asked about their eye exam history. RESULTS: Based on univariate tests results, 18 items were identified as potential predictors for adherence. An additional 6 items were included based on content. A logistic regression model containing these 24 items classified cases with 83.5% ac curacy. Among the strongest predictors were (a) satisfaction with eye care provider, (b) confidence in one's ability to make an appointment, and (c) barriers that make obtaining eye exams difficult. CONCLUSIONS: The CADEES shows promise for predicting whet her diabetic patients are likely to have yearly eye exams. Further research is needed to confirm these preliminary results. Objective: 1) Discuss the importance of retinopathy screening for diabetic patients. 2) Identify the factors associated with obtaini ng annual eye exams.

In September 2011, the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) launched a national, voluntary accreditation program for state, local, territorial and tribal public health departments. For a public health department to be accredited, it must meet st ringent requirements listed within 11 Domains (administrative capacity and the 10 Essential Services of Public Health) while demonstrating a commitment to continuous improvement. Under PHAB's requirements, Local Public Health Authorities must also have, at a minimum, a Department or Organization Strategic Plan, Community Health Assessment, and Community Health Improvement Plan. Oregon lacks a standardized health assessment tool that will support its public health system in accessing, analyzing and displayin g data to fulfill the functions of a community health assessment. The poster will provide an update on the active collaboration between the state and local health departments in building an efficient and effective system (Community Health Assessment Tool o r CHAT) for using data in public health. Objective: Participants will: 1. Understand PHAB's core requirements for accreditation. 2. Understand how CHAT will fulfill one of the three PHAB requirements.
