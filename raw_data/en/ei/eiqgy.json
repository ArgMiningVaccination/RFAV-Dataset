This forum is one of the most pioneering and exciting conferences anywhere in the world. We see it as a new era of corporate and state responsibility to the natural environment and, more profoundly, a chance to reframe nature as the solution to global challenges, rather than a part of the problem. With the global population heading towards nine billion, the natural world is facing unprecedented pressure to support human activity. Not only will this have profound consequences for society and the economy, it will also have major strategic implications for business. The World Forum will once again provide an opportunity for senior decision makers to explore how risk can be turned into an opportunity by putting natural capital at the heart of their strategy. "}
