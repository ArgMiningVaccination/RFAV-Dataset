P eople traveling in search of effective health remedies have become commonplace throughout many communities in the rural Arkansas hill country. For patients unsatisfied with conventional medicine, the services provided by unorthodox practitioners in Arkansas mountain communities offer hope and promise where conventional therapies have failed. Medical tourism in rural Arkansas has promoted access to folk health systems, preserving them by incorporating them into tourists' health care services, and also has attracted new forms of alternative medicine to the region and encouraged the transformation of some forms of traditional medicine. Ultimately, the blend of alternative, folk, and conventional medicine in the Arkansas highlands is evidence of globalizing forces at work in a regional culture. It also serves to highlight a renewed appreciation for the historic continuity and efficacy of traditional knowledge in the upper South. Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and ...

Medical anthropology 1980 This paper documents the responsibilities of spirit mediums in Zimbabwe and highlights gender balance in the systems. It reveals that the spirit of the same Gombwe may be on men, women, or objects, at different places at the same time and the choice is made by the spirit. Hence, gender balance is not an issue. The study also seeks to find out the views of African traditional medical practitioners about the way traditional medicine should develop: i.e., independent development, or integration, or assimilation into the conventional system. N'angas and herbalists had mixed feelings about the course of action to follow, but all, including maGombwe, agreed that there is need to develop traditional medicine. The government of Zimbabwe, like other governments in the Southern African Development Community region, supports the development of traditional medicine.
