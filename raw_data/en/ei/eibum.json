It doesn't seem to be my gums or teeth, but instead comes from my throat, which is occasionally infected. I've been prescribed throat sprays by my GP, but am reluctant to continue using them. I am a vegetarian and regularly brush my teeth, but nothing works. Are there any natural remedies? The following products are worth trying, being natural, immune system-boosting and safe to use continuously. Propolis is a substance made by bees to protect themselves, and is a powerful antibacterial and antiviral agent. Propolis Throat Spray, by Comvita, is formulated from propolis tincture for protection against bacteria and infections that cause bad breath. You can also get propolis lozenges. and peppermint essential oil, as well as manuka, which combined make a high-potency antibacterial mouthwash and gargle. Use both daily. (From Xynergy, 08456 585858 or [xynergy.co.uk](http://www.xynergy.co.uk).) I'm 31, my periods are not regular, and before each I get bad spots and urge incontinence. What can I do? Consult your GP first, as further diagnosis may be necessary, although most PMS is due to high levels of oestrogen and low progesterone before menstruation. Increase your intake of fibre, to help expel hormone waste. B vitamins, especially B6, reduce oestrogen levels in the blood. Also, low magnesium levels can cause PMS, while stress and foods that increase stress, such as sugars, alcohol and caffeine, can make symptoms worse. Pre-Mens Prevention (Higher Nature, 01435 882880) contains B6, magnesium, zinc, B and C vitamins and helpful herbs. The herb agnus castus, by Nature's Plus, increases progesterone levels relative to oestrogen and, over time (for example, two to three cycles), regulates periods, while Methionine by Solgar detoxifies excess oestrogen (both from Victoria Health, 0800 389 8195) . I have been suffering from a very dry (inside) nose for the past five months. When I wake up, sometimes blood comes out - mostly dried blood pieces. I have tried various gels from the pharmacy, and also turn off the heating at night and open the window. How can I get my inner nose back to its normal state? Can you think of anything that might have caused your dry nose? Are you on any drugs - for example, blood thinners or aspirin? Changes in hormone levels, such as when pregnant, can cause a bloody nose, too. Or might it be due to environmental factors: do you work in a smoky office or have you moved to a polluted area? Vitamins A and E are needed for healthy mucus membranes; B vitamins, especially Riboflavin (B2), and vitamin C are needed for tissue repair; and C, bioflavinoids and zinc help strengthen fragile blood capillaries - take daily supplements of a multivitamin and mineral and vitamin C plus bioflavinoids. An old wives' tale has it that cold feet cause the glands in the nose to stop working and the membranes to become dry, so it might be an idea to keep your feet warm! The best thing to soothe and heal your nose is a form of aloe vera, Aloe Activator, a potent liquid with anti-inflammatory, healing and analgesic actions. Decant into a spray bottle and use as often as you like. (Forever Living Products, 0870 755 5805.) \u00b7 Emma Mitchell is a natural health therapist.
