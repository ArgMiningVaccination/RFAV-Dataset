But what happens when you combine the two? Now, that's some next-level wellness shit. In the latest episode of Well+Good's YouTube series, [What The Wellness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRG0gUGOvc&list=PLUa1mxBKMRYk5bkHlsIRCKhJP6XIDPwGS), senior video producer Ella Dove raises her hand to try a gemstone acupuncture facial. Scratching your head? The treatment is exactly what it sounds like: A trained acupuncturist inserts needles at various points in the body (and face!) while also incorporating crystals. As Dove explains in the video, the treatment is more than just a trend. It's performed by [Elizabeth Trattner, A.P., LAc](https://elizabethtrattner.com/), a licensed acupuncturist trained in Traditional Chinese Medicine. \"There is a lot of art that goes through this. Obviously gemstones are beautiful, but it's about how everything works and works for you,\" Dr. Trattner explains. Dove also got a little gua sha\u2014a TCM practice where the skin is pressured and scraped in strokes\u2014as part of her treatment. \"It's great at breaking up fascia in the body,\" Dr. Trattner explains. Obviously there's a lot happening in this treatment. So, is it just weird or is it totally worth it? Watch the episode to find out.
