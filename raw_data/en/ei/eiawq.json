Flo Lavallee is trying to set up the \"Saskatoon Health Oasis.\" She says it would be the only clinic in the province providing a full complement of mainstream and alternative practices, like reflexology and massage therapy. \"It basically involves a collaboration of complementary therapists in conjunction with a family physician or a physician that does combined acupuncture and other healing modalities which some physicians do. \"And also complementary therapists, all under one roof, which is the first of its kind in Saskatchewan.\" Lavallee says the clinic would be ideal for people with chronic illnesses like fibromyalgia, because they don't always get the relief they need from mainstream medicine. Lavallee has the backing of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Saskatoon Health District. She hopes to begin construction sometime next year. "}
