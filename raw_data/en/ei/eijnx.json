Volitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Stanford is currently accepting patients for this trial. Stanford Investigator(s): Intervention(s): - drug: Savolitinib Eligibility Inclusion Criteria: - Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a primary CNS tumor (medulloblastoma, high-grade glioma, or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma [DIPG]) that is recurrent, refractory, or progressive. All tumors must have histologic verification at either the time of diagnosis or recurrence except patients with diffuse intrinsic brain stem tumors. These patients must have radiographic or clinical evidence of progression. Patients with a recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary CNS tumor with evidence of genetic activation of the MET pathway, regardless of histology, are also eligible to the Phase I component of this study - Note: Refractory disease is defined as the presence of persistent abnormality on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging that is further distinguished by histology (biopsy or sample of lesion) or advanced imaging, OR as determined by the treating physician and discussed with the primary investigator prior to enrollment - Efficacy Expansion Cohort: Patients must have a recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary CNS tumor with evidence of genetic activation of the MET pathway, regardless of histology. The submitted specimen can be from diagnosis or recurrence and there is no time limit from when the specimen was obtained to enrollment onto the efficacy expansion cohort.

If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because there are unknown but potential risks to an unborn baby from savolitinib.
