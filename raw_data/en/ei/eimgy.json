Physicians for Informed Consent (PIC) has recently released 2 education documents. The first is a Disease Information Statement for hepatitis B titled, \"Hepatitis B: What Parents Need to Know,\" and the second is a Vaccine Risk Statement for Hepatitis B titled, \"Hepatitis B Vaccine: Is It Safer Than Hepatitis B?\" These documents were developed to help people assess the risks of hepatitis B and its vaccine and make an informed decision on vaccination. \"New parents need to know that if their infants are normal-risk, which 99% of newborns are, then the chance of them getting fatal hepatitis B is 0.00001% or one in seven million \u2014 a prevaccine statistic,\" said Shira Miller, MD, PIC founder and president. \"They also need to know that all hepatitis B vaccines include the neurotoxin aluminum \u2014 which means there's a 100% guarantee their infant will be exposed to aluminum if they get injected with a hepatitis B vaccine.\" The documents explain what Hepatitis B is, what the side effects of the hepatitis B vaccine are, and whether the vaccine is safer than Hepatitis B. Important information is discussed, such as how an unvaccinated normal-risk children has a 1 in 7 million chance of developing fatal hepatitis B. Another fact included in the documents is that about 50% of children vaccinated for hepatitis B lose their immunity before age 5. The vaccine also does not have a significant effect on the appearance of chronic hepatitis B infection, and it may cause seizures in about 1 in 1300 children. The level of aluminum in the vaccine is about 75 times greater than the maximum amount of aluminum safe for infants weighing about 7 pounds. When analyzing the evidence, the Institution of Medicine concluded that the possibility of the hepatitis B vaccination causing more than 2 dozen neurological and autoimmune disorders cannot be ruled out.
