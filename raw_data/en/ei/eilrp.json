Introduction The doctors and nurses at the University of Michigan Surgery Oncology Clinic created this booklet to explain melano ma and the treatmen t options available to you. This is not a comprehensive guide to treatment options - they are changing every day. Rather, we hope this guide helps you move forward with a firm understanding of melanoma, how it is treated, and what the experience may include. With this information in hand, you will be prepared to make thoughtful decisions along with your medical team.

Melanocytes are found throughout the lower part of the epidermis See Figure 1. They make me lanin, the pigment that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment, causing the skin to tan, or darken. Figure 1. Anatomy of the Skin Epidermis Dermis Hair Follicle Sweat Gland Muscle Cells Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 4 (T his section is excerpted from the Nati onal Cancer Institut e's \"What You Need to Know About Melanoma\" available at www.cancer.gov ) Anatom y of your skin The skin is the body's largest organ. It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection. It helps regulate body temperature, stores water and fat, and produces vitamin D. The skin has two main layers: the ou ter epidermis and th e inner dermis. (See Figure 1). The epidermis is mostly made up of flat, scale like cells called squamous cells. Round cells called basa l cells lie under the sq uamous cells in the epidermis. The lower part of the epid ermis also contains melanocytes. The dermis contains blood vessels, lymph vessels, hair follicles, and glands. Some of these gl ands produce sweat, which helps regulate body temperature. Other gl ands produce sebum, an oi ly substance that helps keep the skin from drying out. Sweat and sebum reach the skin's surface through tiny op enings called pores. Melanocytes and Moles Melanocytes produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun, mela nocytes produce more pigment, causing the skin to tan, or darken. Sometimes, clusters of melanocytes and surrounding tissue form noncancerous growths called moles . (Doctors also call a mole a nevus ; the plural is nevi.) Moles are very common. Most people ha ve between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 5 be pink, tan, brown, or a color that is very close to the pe rson's normal skin tone. People who have dark skin tend to have dark moles. Moles can be flat or raised. They are usually round or oval and smaller than a pencil eraser. They may be present at birth or may appear later on \u2014usually before age 40. They tend to fade away in older people . When moles are surgically removed, they normally do not return. Cancer and the Skin Cancer begins in cells, the building bl ocks that make up tissues. Tissues make up the organs of the body. Normally, cells grow and divi de to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old, they di e, and new cells take their place. Sometimes this orderly process goes wr ong. New cells form when the body does not need them, and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass of ti ssue called a growth or tumor . Not all tumors are cancer. Tumors can be benign or malignant : Benign tumors are not cancer: They are rarely life threatening. Usually, benign tumors can be remove d, and they seldom grow back. Cells from benign tumors do not spre ad to tissues around them or to other parts of the body. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 6 Malignant tumors are cancer: They are generally more serious and may be life threatening. Malignant tumors usuall y can be removed, but they can grow back. Cells from malignant tumors can inva de and damage ne arby tissues and organs. Also, cancer cells can brea k away from a malignant tumor and enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system . That is how cancer cells spread from the orig inal cancer (the primary tumor ) to form new tumors in other organs. The spread of cancer is called metastasis. Different types of cancer tend to spread to different parts of the body. Melanoma Melanoma occurs when melanocytes (pigment cells) become malignant. Most of these pigment cells are in the skin. Wh en melanoma starts in the skin, the disease is called cutane ous melanoma. Melanoma may also occur in the eye (ocular melanoma or intraocular melanoma). Rarely, melanoma may arise in the meninges (brain), the di gestive tract, lymph node s, or other areas where melanocytes are found. Melanomas that begin in areas other than the skin are not discussed in this booklet. The Cancer Information Service (1-800-4- CANCER) can provide information about these types of melanoma. Melanoma is one of the most common ca ncers. The chance of developing it increases with age, but this disease affects people of all ages. It can occur on any skin surface. In men, melanoma is often found on th e trunk (the area between the shoulders and th e hips) or the head and neck. In women, it often develops on the lower legs. Melanoma is rare in people with dark skin. When it does develop in dark-skinned people, it tends to occur under the fingernails or toenails, or on the palms of th e hands or soles of the feet. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 7 When melanoma spreads, ca n cer cells may show up in nearby lymph nodes. Groups of lymph nodes are found thro ughout the body. Lymph nodes trap bacteria, cancer cells, or other harmful su bstances that may be in the lymphatic system. If the cancer has reached the lymp h nodes, it may be a sign that cancer cells have spread to other pa rts of the body such as the liver, lungs, or brain. In such cases, the cancer cells in the new tumor are still melanoma cells, and the disease is called metastatic melanoma, not liver, lung, or brain cancer. Staging If the diagnosis is melanoma , the doctor needs to learn the extent, or stage, of the disease before planning treatment. St aging is a careful attempt to learn how thick the tumor is, how deeply the melanoma has invaded the skin, and whether melanoma cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body. The doctor may remove nearby lymph nodes to check for cancer cells. (Such surgery may be considered part of the treatment because removing cancerous lymph nodes may help control the disease.) The do ctor also does a careful physical exam and, if the tumor is thick, may order chest x-rays, blood tests, and scans of the li ver, bones, and brain. Stages of Melanoma The following stages ar e used for melanoma: Stage 0: In stage 0, the melanoma cells are found only in the outer layer of skin cells and have not invaded deeper tissues. Stage I: Melanoma in stage I is thin: The tumor is no more than 1 mi llimeter (1/25 inch) thick. The outer layer (epidermis) of skin may appear scraped. (This is called an ulceration). Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 8 Or, the tumor is between 1 and 2 millimeters (1/12 inch) thick. There is no ulceration. The melanoma cells have not sp read to nearby lymph nodes. Stage II: The tumor is at least 1 millimeter thick: The tumor is between 1 and 2 millimeters thick. There is ulceration. Or, the thickness of th e tumor is more than 2 millimeters. There may be ulceration The melanoma cells have not spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage III: The melanoma cells ha ve spread to nearby tissues: The melanoma cells have spread to one or more nearby lymph nodes. Or, the melanoma cells have spread to tissues just outside the original tumor but not to any lymph nodes. Stage IV: The melanoma cells have spre ad to other organs, to lymph nodes, or to skin areas far aw ay from the or iginal tumor. Recurrent: Recurrent di sease means that the cancer has come back (recurred) after it has been treated. It may have come back in the original site or in another part of the body Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 9 Treatment of Melanoma Local and Regional Therapy Local, regional and systemic therapie s are used to treat melanoma. Local therapy treats the primary tumor in the sk in only. Wide excision surgery is an example of a local therapy. Regional therapy involves evaluating the lymph nodes in an area or 'region'. A sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection is an example of regional therapy. Systemic therapy is intended to reach cancer cells that may have spread beyond the primary site and lymph nodes to the re st of the body. It may be given by mouth, by injection, or delivered direct ly into the bloodstre am. An example of systemic therapy is the biologic therapy called interferon. This surgical patient handbook will focus on local and regional therapies only. Information about other ther apies for the treatment of melanoma can be found at the Patient Education Reso urce Center on level B1 of the UM Comprehensive Cancer Center building. Clinical Trials Your doctor may suggest that you consider p articipating in a clinical tr ial (a research study or protocol) for the treatment of melanoma. Clinical trials are one very important reason that the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center is able to offer our patients access to the latest cancer treatments. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 10 Clinical trails (also called \"protocols\") may involve testing of new treatments, supportive care or other research to understand cancer (such as tissue banking). The goal of a trial is usually to find ways to improve therapy or decrease side effects. While a trial or study is active or in- progress, we will not know whethe r any potential improvement has been achieved . The trial must be closed and the research analyzed before the treatment being studied can be made widely available to patients. There may be some risks associated with research. Your doctor will discuss both the potential risks and benefits in detail with you and obtain your written permission before starting yo u on a research protocol. Oversight committees at the University of Michigan Health System conduct an extensive review of all clinical trials. These committees include an \"institution review board\" or IRB made up of other ca ncer do ctors, doctors in other specialties and lay people. The IRB reviews all protocols before they are available to patients and again at different times during the research to be sure the protocol remains appropriate and safe for patients. All patients on a protocol receive the best care possible, and their reactions to the treatment are watched very closely. If the treatment doesn't seem to be helping, a doctor can take a patient out of a study. Also, the patient may choose to leave the study at any time. If a patient leaves a study for any reason, standard care and tr eatment will be initiated. Clinical trials are voluntary. Your mela noma will be treated whether you decide to join a protocol or not. For more information about clinical trials, visit the Clinical Trials section of the Rogel Cancer Center website: www.rogelcancercenter.org Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 11 Types of Melanoma Surgery Wide Local Excision You have been diagnosed with melanoma af ter the biopsy of a skin lesion. In most cases, it is recommended to re move more skin around the area of melanoma. This is done with a procedure called a wide local excision. A wide local excision is a procedure in which an area of skin and tissue surrounding the melanoma is removed. The skin an d tissue removed (called the \"excision\") will extend down to your muscle, but no muscle will be removed. The amount of tissue removed around the melanoma depends on the Breslow depth of the melanoma (found on the or iginal biopsy pathology report). Your surgeon will recommend that 1 - 2 cm (a pproximately \u00bd - 1 inch) of skin and tissue be removed surrounding the melano ma. This additional skin and tissue is removed to help prevent a recurren ce of the melanoma . There is a 30-60% chance that the melanoma will recur at th e primary site if th is additional skin and tissue is not removed. During surgery, the surgeon will mark a 1-2 cm circle ar ound the original melanoma. Often, the surgeon will reshape this circle to an ellipse shape (the shape of a football). This shape improves the \"closure\" of the incision. There may be times that the incision is so big that the surrounding tissues aren't able to stretch over the site to close it. If this is the case, a skin gr aft is used to cover the open area. However, in order to avoid a skin graft, the surgical area may be closed using a rotational or advancem ent flap. This involves loosening the surrounding tissues from th eir underlying structures and then moving them to cover the defect. This can not always be done and sometimes a skin graft will still need to be done. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 12 The incision will be closed with suture s. Because the wide exci sion removes a large piece of tissue and skin, the incision is often under tension. This means that the sutures will need to remain in place for 14- 21 days. On rare occasions when there is no tension on the incision, absorbable sutures may be used. Skin Graft Some patients require the pl acement of a piece of skin over the excision site to help it close. This piece of skin is call ed a graft. Grafts are stapled or sutured in place over the surgical site. The site where the graf t skin is taken from is called the 'donor site'. Skin grafts are used to help close excisions that involve: large areas requiring replacement skin, or parts of the body that have little loos e skin; such as an kles, elbows, ears and other joints Skin grafts heal over several weeks. Th e graft will leave a scar; as will the donor site. It will fade over time, but will still leave a scar. Split Thickness Skin Graft A split thickness skin graft is a proc edure in which your surgeon removes a very thin layer of skin from the donor si te, usually the front of your thigh. The graft is placed in the open skin area left by the wide local excision. This allows the primary site to heal more quickly than it would without a graft. With this procedure you will usually go home the same day. In some cases you may be admitted to the Observation unit overnight. This will be decided by your doctor. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 13 Full Thickness Skin Graft In this p rocedure a deeper layer of skin including hair follicles and other skin structures are removed from the donor site and placed in the surgical area. The post operative care is the same as a split thic kness skin graft with the exception of the donor site. (Refer to the Next Steps section for complete instructions on caring for the donor site). The donor site of a full thickness skin gr aft is closed like an incision, usually with absorbable sutures. Your surgeon may use the same site as the sentinel lymph node biopsy for the donor site in order to avoid an additional incision . Assessing Lymph Node Involvement Why are lymph nodes important? Cancer cells can break off from the initial melanoma tumor and travel to other parts of the body through the lymph fluid (or the blood stream). Once in the lymph fluid, they pass th rough the lymph nodes. The presence of cancer cells in lymph nodes is an indication that the cancer can spread and is a more aggressive type of cancer. Learning whether or not cancer is pres ent in the lymph nodes, and how many nodes are involved, are impo rtant factors in the treatm ent of melanoma. This information can help you an d your doctor decide whet her systemic therapy or other treatments may be beneficial. In addition, if there is cancer in the lymph nodes, removing that cancer is useful. If lymph nodes are found to be enlarged on physical examination, a procedure called a fine needle aspiration is often done prior to surgery. This procedure is performed in the clinic. During the proc edure a needle is inserted into the Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 14 enlarged node and cells are removed. The cells a re then examined by a cytopathologist underneath a microscope. If the cells examined include malignant or cancerous cells, a surgery called a lymph node dissection is recommended. If there are no cancerous cells present, only a biopsy wo uld be recommended. Most of the time, when patients are ex amined in the clinic, their lymph nodes are not enlarged. In that case a sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended. This procedure is able to find very small amounts of cancer in a lymph node, long before there is enough to enlarge the lymph node. Again, finding even a few cancer cells in a lymph node is an important factor in determining treatment for your melanoma. Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping The 'sentinel node' is located in the grou p of lymph nodes that are the first to drain the area of your body where the melanoma is located. For example, a melanoma on the arm drains to the axilla (or armpit) while melanoma on the leg drains to the groin. If the melanoma is located on the tr unk it can drain to either the axilla or groin or both area s. Sometimes it can even drain to other areas such as the neck, behi nd the knee, or elbow. At each site there can be more than one sentinel node. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 15 Fi gure 2: Sentinel Node in groin lymph node group Lymph fluid drains from th e site of the tumor to on e or two lymph nodes first before going to the other nodes in the re gion. The \"sentinel node(s)\" is the first lymph node to which a tumo r drains, and therefore is the most likely to have cancer if the cancer has spread to the nodes. Once the sentinel lymph no de(s) is found, it will be removed and sent to pathology to see if it contains cancer. Locating the Se ntinel Node There are two techniques used to locate the sentinel no des that drain a surgical area. In most cases both will be used. Sentinel Node Melanoma Site Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 16 The first technique uses an injection of a radio active solution to make the nodes visible on an x-ray. The other technique involves injecting blue dye into the area around the melano ma and examining the first nodes to become blue by absorbing the blue dye. Surgeons use both of these techniques to locate the sentinel node. Your sentinel lymph node biop sy will begin in the Nuclear Medicine Department the day before your surgery or the morning of your surgery. This procedure involves the injection of a weak ra dioactive solution to make the sentinel node radioactiv e and visible on x-ray. It is important to remember that the solution will caus e the lymph nodes to show up on the x-ray as black dots. This does NOT mean that there is cancer in the lymph nodes, but is a way to find the sentinel lymph node so it can be tested. You will spend approximately 2 hours in the nuclea r medicine depart ment between the injection and the completion of the x-ray. You will be awake during this part of the procedure and after it is completed you will go home or to admitting for your surgery. Once in the operating room, the surgeo n will perform the second technique to identify the sentinel lymp h node. To begin the proced ure, your surgeon injects blue dye around the area of your melanoma biopsy. This injection is done after you are asleep from the anesthesia. The dye will travel through the tissue and into the lymph nodes nearest your tumor site. This dye will assist the su rgeon in locating the sentinel node for removal. Nuclear Medicine is located on level B1 of the Main Hospital. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 17 In rare cases the radioactive solution and/or dye will not move toward the lymph nodes which means that no sentinel node can be identified. In this case the procedure will be stoppe d and your surgeon will disc uss the next steps with you. What are the side effects of sentinel lymph node biopsy? Side effects of sentinel node biopsy can include minor pain or bruising at the biopsy site and the rare poss ibility of an allergic reaction to the blue dye used in finding the sentinel node. Some pa tients develop a sma ll fluid collection, about the size of a golf ball, at the site of the sentinel lymph node biopsy. This does not usually bother pa tients too much and will resolve on its own within a few weeks of the surgery. Contact your surgeon's office if it persists longer than this, becomes painful, red, or becomes larger than a golf-ball. You may experience some numbness in the back of your upper arm or inner thigh near the site of your sentinel lymph node biopsy. This will improve over time, but might not comp letely resolve. Additionally, some people ex perience swelling of the entire arm or leg called lymphedema. This is not common after sentinel lymph node biopsy and it can be treated with physical therapy. Howe ver, for patients who have lymphedema, it can be a life-long issue. The blue dye used in the se ntinel lymph node mappi ng is el iminated from you r body in your ur ine. This changes the color o f your urine to blue-green for about 24 hours after the procedure. This causes no harm. The area of the injection with blue dye will have a blue color to it. Many patients described the area as looking like a blue bruise. The color will lessen with time, although it will be visible for several weeks to several months after the procedure. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 18 If I have a sentinel ly mph node biopsy, does this mean that I don't need a lymph node dissection? If there is no cancer found in the sentinel node, then our approach is to not perform a lymph node dissection. This is because the chance that there may be cancer in another lymph node that wasn't removed is very small. However, if the sentinel lymph node does show cancer, there is no way to know whether any other lymph nodes contain canc er. Therefore, the standard of care is to proceed with a lymph node dissection in which the remaining lymph nodes in the same area are removed. If cancer is found in the sentinel node, the dissection will be scheduled as a second operation. When will I find out if there was cancer in the sentinel lymph node? Your surgeon will call you 5-7 days af ter your surgery wi th the pathology results. This will allow the necessar y time for the pathologist to closely examine the sentinel lymp h node tissue and prepar e a pathology report. Lymph Node Dissection Your surgeon will recommend a lymph node dissection if the sentinel node(s) contain cancer or if the lymph nodes can be felt on physical exam and a fine needle aspiration confirms that the no de contains cancerous cells. During a lymph node dissection, th e surgeon makes an incision and removes the fatty tissue where the lymph nodes are located. The number of lymph nodes removed de pends on the indivi dual person and where the tumor is located on the body, such as in the groin, armpit, or neck. In this surgery an area of tissue containing lymph no des, called a fat pad, is Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 19 Further information about lymphedema and its treatment can be found on page 41. removed, the lymph nodes are not remove d individually. When the pathologist reviews the tissue the lymp h nodes will be counted and reviewed individually to look for cancer cells. Axillary Lymph Node Dissection During an axillary lymph node dissect ion (called an 'ALND') a fat pad is removed from your axilla or armpit. Tissue is removed from this area and from around your chest wall muscle. Between 10-30 lymph nodes are usually removed. You will need to take special care of yo ur arm after an axillary lymph node dissection. Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection During an inguinal lymph node dissection a fat pad in your groin is removed. This removes approximately 8-15 lymph nodes. Sometimes a small muscle located in your outer thig h is moved over to help cover the area where the tissue was removed and protect the blood ve ssels supplying your leg. You will need to take special care of your le g after inguinal node surgery. Review the instructions in the Postoperative Care section called 'Next Steps'. What are the side effect s of a lymph node dissection? Approximately 10-30% percent of the patients who undergo a lymph node dissection experience chronic problems related to the diss ection, such as swelling of the entire limb (lymphedema), or pain or discomfo rt in the area of the dissection. Some steps you can take to pr event lymphedema include: Avoid having blood drawn from your arm on the affected side. Do not have your blood pressure taken on the affected arm. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 20 Further information about drains, exercises, and postoperative care can be found in the Next Steps section Be careful to avoid infection in that ar m or leg; and contact your doctor or nurse practitioner if you see swel ling or signs of infection. There are nerves that run through the tissue where the lymph nodes are located that provide sensation to th e skin. In most cases, th ese nerves are cut during the surgery. This does no t affect mobility or streng th in your limb, but can cause mild numbness. Some of the other possible complication s associated with this type of lymph node removal include: Temporary limitations in movement of the involved limb after surgery Infection of the surgical area Accumulation of blood in th e surgical area (hematoma) Accumulation of clear fluid in the surgical area (seroma) What will happen the day of the surgery? An axillary lymph node diss ection is done as an outpatient pr ocedure, while an inguinal lymph node dissection may require an overnight stay in the Observation Unit. Since the remaining tissues tend to \"leak\" some lymph fluid when the lymph nodes are removed, a dr ain is left in place for the first 2 to 3 weeks after the operation, or until the area heals. The drain is a flex ible plastic tube that exits the skin and is connected to a plastic collection bulb. See Figure 3. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 21 When the dr ainage diminishes to a certain amount, the drain is removed in the clinic. Figure 3: Postoperative drain The drain can be removed when the total drainage is less than 30 ccs each day, for 2 days in a row . Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 23 Preoperative Considerations Preparing for Surgery Once you have made your treatment decision all necessary surgeries and appointments will be scheduled. This is a complex process; involving many different people and departments. Our surgical schedulers will work with you to make this process as smooth, uncomplicated and quick as possible. They will contact you within 72 hours of your clinic visit with your appointment times and dates. They can be r eached at (734-936-6360 We know that waiting for surgery can be very difficult once the decision has been made. Please let us know how we can make this proces s better for you. It is important to be in the best possible health for surgery. It is important to eat a well-balanced diet, get exercise, and rest. Smoking can greatly impact surgical risk and recovery. If you smok e, we recommend that you quit. We do not recommend that you simp ly stop smoking without help (\"cold turkey\"). This can be harmful to your health and is usually not successful. Discuss the best options for quitting smok ing with your physician. Please allow the surgical scheduler 72 hours after your initial appointment to schedule all necessary appointments. She will contact you after this time with your surgery dates . Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 24 Notify your nurse if you take Coumadin or other blood thinners. You will need special instructions before surgery. Medications & Supplements to Avoid Many medications have an effect on bleedi ng or on the anesth esia that is given during surgery or procedures. It is important that you review all medications an d supplements with your doctor or nurse before a ny procedure is performed. This includes all medications (prescription and those purchased \"over the counter\") as well as any herbal supplement (pills, teas, etc.) or vitamins. This document contains a list of so me of the common aspirin containing medications or those known to affect bleeding. Many medication s for colds, flu, headaches and other ailments contai n some amount of aspirin. It is important to read the labels for acetyl salicylic acid which is the name for Aspirin. New medicati ons are available daily, so be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist about medicati ons and supplements not fo und on this list. Drugs that Affect Bleeding One (1) week prior to surgery any medica tion that contains aspirin, aspirin products, ibuprofen and certain herbal products should be discontinued because they promote bleeding. Note, this list is sele ctive and does not include all medications that affect bleeding. Products containing aspirin (Do not take for 1 week prior to surgery) Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID's). (Do not take fo r 1 week prior to surgery) Please note, this list is selective and do es not include all medi cations that supplement products that may affect bleeding (Do not take for 2-3 we eks prior to surgery): Notify your doctor of any herb or su pplement that you are taking prior to surgery. This list only applies to herbs that are taken in the form of a supplement. You do not need to avoid th ese herbs in your di et or food. These herbs only affect bleeding in the amount s generally taken as supplements, not in the amounts normally found in food preparations. Gingko biloba Ginger Ginseng Vitamin E Feverfew Cayenne Garlic Bilberry fruit Herbs and supplement products that may affect anesthesia (Do not take for 2-3 weeks prior to surg ery): St. John's Wort Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 26 Advanced Directives All individuals who are sc heduled for surgery are asked whether or not they have an Advanced Directive, Power of Atto rney for Health Care, or a Living Will. Written materials are available to educate you on these topics. Ask your doctor or nurse if you need more informatio n or stop by the Patient Education Resource Center for further materials. If you have an Advanced Directive, pl ease bring a copy to the preoperative evaluation or to the admitting lounge on th e day of your surgery. The copy will be placed in your medical record. Be sure to notify your heal th care team that you have completed an Adva nced Directive document. The Preoperative Appointment To prepare you for surgery and for the recovery after surgery, you will be scheduled to return for a preoperative appointment. A complete history and physical exam is required of all patients within 30 days of a surgical procedure. This appointment will be scheduled at the Surgical Pre-Operative Center at the Do mino Farms complex. Every patient is prepared for surgery differently depending on medical history, type of surgery and postoperative needs. Therefore, so me appointments may last 1-2 hours, while others may take 4-6 hours an d will include seve ral additional appointments. Plan to be at the preopera tive center in Domino Farm s at least 2 hours for this appointment, but expect that additional time may be necessary. Directions and Maps to the Preoperative Center at Domino Farms can be found at the back of this booklet. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 27 About the Preoperative Appointment: Th is appointment includes a complete history and physical examination, an explanation of your surgery and its risks and benefits, and instructions to prepare you for the surgery. You will meet with a nurse practitioner or a physician's assistant and a nurse the day of your pre-surgery evaluation. Your surgeon does not normally see you the day of your preoperative evaluation. If you have a question regarding your surgery that isn't answered at the preoperative appointment, please contact your surgeon's office directly. At this visit you will: Have a complete history and physical exam including a review of all of your medications and use of su pplemental herbs & vitamins. Sign your consent to have surgery. You will receive a copy of this consent to take home with you. Complete pre-surgical testing that may include an EKG, X-rays and laboratory tests. These tests will be performe d that day. Receive comprehensive education about your surgery, its risks, benefits and anticipated recovery. The clinic nurse will also review any assistance you may need with equipment, educat ion or resources before, during and after your surgery. See the anesthesiologist in the anesthesia clin ic. This additional appointment may not be scheduled fo r all patients. The medical team will decide if this is indicated at the time of yo ur preoperative appointment.Your physical health and medical history must be evaluated prior to all surgical procedures. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 28 Please bring the following to your preoperative appointment: T he family member(s) or friend who wi ll be caring for you after surgery. A list of your curren t medications and supple ments; their dosages (amounts) and how often you take your medications. Pl ease include all prescription meds, non-prescription (over the counter medications), vitamins, supplements, herbs and homeopathic remedies. Any recent (less than one year old) ca rdiac tests that have been done at a non University of Michigan facility, su ch as a stress test or EKG. If you have a cardiac history, you will need your cardiac physician to send a letter of clearance to proceed with surgery. Any recent (less than one year old) pulmonary tests that have been done at a non-University of Michigan facility, such as a Chest X-ray. Physician letter of approv al to discontinue any bl ood thinning medication (such as Coumadin\u00ae, Plavix\u00ae, Lovenox\u00ae). The phone number where you (the pati ent) can be reached the day before surgery. We will need to record this in case of emergency should we need to contact you. Scheduling the Preoperative Appointment: The surgery scheduler will be calling you with your a ppointment times. Please allow at least 72 hours after your clinic visit to rece ive your appointment dates and times. Special Considerations: If you have a cardiac history (for example a past heart attack, history of angina or heart failur e), please bring a letter for \"Cardiac Clearance\" from your cardiologist or internist. In addition, please bring a copy of your most recent EKG, stress test, and/or echocardiograms to the preoperative appointment. If you are on any blood-thinning medications such as Coumadin\u00ae or Plavi x\u00ae, you will need to bring a letter from the prescribing physician Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 29 approving discontinuation of this medi c ation for 5-7 days before surgery (these include medications containing aspirin and non-steroidal medications such as Motrin\u00ae and Aleve\u00ae). If you are uncertain of any medication, you should discus s this with your doctor. Female patients: this phys ical exam does not includ e a pelvic exam or Pap smear. You will need to see your primary doctor wh en you are due for your annual gynecologic exam. What if I need to Reschedule or Cancel the Appointment? If you need to reschedule or cancel your Pre-Surgery Appointment please call the surgery scheduler at (734) 615-0073 or (734) 763-3470. Blood Donation Whenever surgery is perfor med, a certain amount of blood is lost. Patients undergoing surgery for melanoma do not routinely require blood transfusions. In fact, it is rare and only in emergency situations that a patient would require a blood transfusion. The University of Michigan Hospital has a blood bank, which works in partnership with the Amer ican Red Cross. Together these organizations provide patients with necessary blood an d /or blood products. Your safety is top priority. Careful testing is perf ormed to ensure compatibility and to minimize the risk of disease transmis sion, such as hepatitis and AIDS. Please discuss your concerns with your doctor. You may also contact the Blood Transfusion and Apheresis Center at th e University of Michigan at (734) 936- 6900. Remember, you will most likely NOT need a blood transfusion. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 30 The Day of Surgery The sched ule for your day of surgery will depend on the type of surgery you are having. Will I Be Hospitalized? Most melanoma surgeries are done on an outpatient basis and do not require hospitalization. In general, pati ents undergoing ingu inal lymph node dissections or skin grafts will be admi tted from the recovery room and will stay one night in the observation unit. Patients Having a Lymph Node Dissection If you are having an inguin al lymph node dissection, yo u will be admitted to the observation unit on the same day of surgery. You may hear someone say that you are an \"ADP\" patient. These lette rs stand for Admiss ion Day Procedure. Patients unde rgoing an ax illary lymph node dissection will have outpatient surgery and will be discharged ho me from the recovery area. Individuals who require moni toring or treatments while preparing for surgery are admitted to the hospital the day be fore surgery. This is not common. Patients Having a Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping Procedure Patients undergoing a sentinel lymph node biopsy have a complex schedule involving appointments prior to surgery. Your injection may be done either the af ternoon before or the morning of your surgery. Your nurse or the surgery sc heduler will let you know the date and time of your injection. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 31 It is important to report dir ectly to the Nuclear Me dicine Depart ment, located on level B1 of University Hospital, for the lymph node mapping procedure. You will spend about two hours in the nuclear medicine department. Once in the operating room, the surgeo n will perform the sentinel lymph node biopsy and then additional melanoma surgery as nece ssary. You can go home from the hospital that day, as long as you are feeling okay. Patients Having an Outpatient Procedure If you are scheduled to have surgery as an outpatient, you will have surgery and then be released to home on the same day. You will mo st likely have surgery in the morning and spend the afternoon recovering. Trained personnel will monitor you as the effects of anesthesia wear off. You will be released when your condition is stable and your recovery is proceeding well. If your condition requires monitoring, you will be admitted. Pack an overnight bag and store it in your car just in case. Al so, you must bring someone al ong who will be able to drive you home. If you plan to travel home by taxi or bus you must have another person with you. Your surgery will be cancelled if you arrive without someone else to make sure you get home safely. Please discuss any transportation problems wi th your doctor or nurse before the day of the procedure. When you are released, you will be given: Detailed instructions about how to care for yourself at home Prescriptions for any needed medication A telephone number to call if questions or concerns ariseYou will not be released from the outpatient surgery area unless you have a driver present . Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 32 Postoperative Considerations Surgical Drains and Dressings Dressings (Surgical sites NOT involving a skin graft). Yo u will have a dressing placed over the surgical site in the operating room. This original dressing should remain in place for 48 hours. The type of dressing used will vary by the type of surgery, the location of the incision and the surgeon wh o performed the surgery. Different surgeons use different dressings in different locations. Most lymph node biopsy dressings have an outer dressing and an inner dressing. The inner dressing is made up of glue that is used to seal the skin. This will appear dry and flaky and will fall off on its own over time. The outer dressing usually co nsists of a layer of gauze or a clear plastic film covering (called Tegaderm\u00ae). This dre ssing should be removed in 48 hours. At the wide local excision site, you will have a bulky dressing that can be removed in 48 hours. After the bulky dressing is removed, you may place a light dressing over the site for comfort if you desire. Removing the dressing over a surgical site and looking at the incision for the first time can be stressful. Please discuss your co ncerns with your nurse, surgeon or social worker, and make them aware of your feelings. If you are admitted to the hospital, th e initial dressing will be removed before you leave and a nurse will assist you. If you are at home, it may be helpful to have a family member or close friend with you to help with the first dressing change. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 33 After removing the outer dr essi ng, you may shower (no baths or hot tubs). Avoid running water directly on the incision. Pat the incision area dry. After the first week you may wa sh your incision with soap and water. We do not recommend the use of special lo tions, antibiotic ointments or creams on the incision area. It's best to let it heal on its own. Fluid Collections: Fluid collections under any in cision are normal, and may feel like a soft or hard lump. This is part of the body's way to heal. It will usually go away on its own in one to two months. Please notify yo ur doctor/nurse if the fluid collection continues to increase in size, becomes painful over the entire area, or has a reddened area greater th an 1 inch in size around the incision area. Surgical Drains A surgical drain is a soft flexible plas tic tube that is connected to a plastic collection bulb. Drains ar e used to prevent fluid from collecting at the surgery site while the body is healing. They usually remain in place for 1-3 weeks postoperatively, or until the draina ge decreases to a small amount (30 milliliters or less each day, for 2 consecut ive days). Drains are not left in longer than 4 weeks. While your drain is in place: 1.Do not drive until after your drain is removed (at the discretion of your surgeon) 2.It is okay to shower 3.Keep the drain-collecting bulb anchored to your clothing to prevent accide ntally pulling it out.The drain can be removed when the total drainage less than 30 mls each day, for 2 days in a row. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 34 4.Clean the drai n insertion site daily using this procedure: Remove the old dr ain-sponge dressing. Prepare a small cup of solution : \u00bd tap water and \u00bd hydrogen peroxide Dip a clean cotton-tipped swab in the solution and cleanse around the drain area (do NOT dip a us ed swab back into the clean solution). Apply a clean drain sponge around the drain and tape as necessary. Emptying the Drain Empty the collection bulb on your dr ain 3 times daily (o r more often if necessary) using the following procedure: 1. Open the small lid on the top of the bulb and pour th e drainage into the measuring container or cup. 2. Squeeze the bulb and hold it while closing the lid. The bulb needs to be collapsed to create the suctio n needed to drain the incision area. 3. Measure the drainage amount in the cup and record it on the drain record sheets located on page 65 of this book. Record each drain amount separately. 4. Call your nurse practition er when the total daily draina ge is less than 30 milliliters or 30cc's for 2 days in a row. Note that one milliliter (written as 'ml') and one cubic centimeter (written as 'cc') are equal. Stripping the Drain Strip the tubing 3 times daily (or more often if there are many blood clots) using the following proc edure: See Figure 4. 1. Grasp the tubing closest to your body (at the insertion site) with one hand and hold the tubing ti ghtly. This hand will keep Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 35 the tubing from pulling out of your body. 2. Take an alcohol swab in the other hand. Using the swab, pinch the tubing tightly just below yo ur first hand. 3. Keeping the tubing pinched, slide the alcohol sw ab down the tubing toward the collection bulb and away from your body. You should notice any clots in the tube are forced down the tube and into the collection bulb. This is called \"stripping\" or \"milking\" the tube. The tube may become flat from the suction. This is okay. Figure 4: Stripping the Drain After your drain is removed: Your drain will be removed in the surgery clinic. Once it has been removed you may notice a small collect ion of fluid at the site. A small collection of fluid is normal (about th e size of a walnut or quarter). This will not harm you and will reabsorb in to the tissue within a month or Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 36 two. If the fluid becomes l arger than this (about the size of an orange), you should notify the su rgical nurse practitioner s at the phone numbers listed in the back of this book. This fluid collecti on is not an emergency. Once the drain has been removed, you should follow these guidelines: 1. Keep the site dry with a gauze dr essing over it for the first 48 hours. 2. Stop using the hydrogen peroxide; use only soap and water for cleaning. 3.Some leaking at the drain site is normal. If the site continues to leak after 3 days, contact the surgical nurse practitioners. A continuously leaking site can lead to infection. Notify the surgical nurse practitioner s of any large flui d collections. Special Instructions after Ingui nal Lymph Node Dissection Surgery What special care do I need after surger y? When lymph nodes are removed from an ar ea, the body's ability to drain that area may be affected. This can cause fluid to collect at the surgical site. Also, the groin area can be difficult to keep clean and dry, which is important for good healing. You will be asked to foll ow the directions below to reduce any side effects of the surgery and to promote healing. If you have questions or are unable to perform these tasks, we ask th at you contact your surgical team for assistance. Swelling Your leg will be more prone to swelli ng. This can be temporary or can become chronic. It is common to ex perience some swelling in the first Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 37 few days after surgery. To reduce swelling, you will be instructed to elevate your leg above the level of yo ur heart throughout the day as well as at night until your po stoperative clinic appointment. You should avoid placing your leg in a do wnward (dependent) position for any extended amount of time. To decrease the risk of chronic swelling (called 'lymphedema') you will be given a prescription during your preoperative appointment for a special stocking. This stocking is made of material that helps prevent swelling in your leg. It is called a compression stocking. You will begin wearing this after your drain(s) is remove d and will continue to wear it for 4-6 months after surgery. After that, you can use the stocking as needed. You should ha ve this prescription fill ed before your surgery. Compression stockings are available at most medical supply stores. If swelling persists, it is important to notify your health care provider. They may prescribe physical therapy to assist in treating the swelling. A more comprehensive description of lymphedema can be found in the next section of this handbook. Incision and Skin Care Because the inguinal area is dark, moist, and includes areas in skin folds and around joints (the hips), the surg ical area can sometimes be hard to heal. For these reasons you will need to pay close attention to keeping the surgical area clean and dry. You should keep a dry, non-sterile gauze dressing or pad over your incision to absorb mois ture and keep it away from your incision. You should chan ge this daily and as needed to keep Make sure you fill your prescription for a compression stocking BEFORE your surgery Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 38 the area dry. You can find non-steril e ga uze pads at most pharmacies or drug stores. You may shower 48 hours after surgery. Avoid running water directly on the incision area. Pat the incision area dry after showering and place a clean gauze pad over the incision. Do not use any lotion, antibiotic ointment, creams, powders, or healing gels on the incision area. It is best to let the incision heal on its' own. It is most important to keep the area clean and dry. These pr oducts may create a mois t area that only helps bacteria to grow. (In some cases, you will be given betadine swabs to clean the area twice a day). Avoid baths, swimming pools and ho t tubs until approved by your surgeon. Be sure to lo ok at your incision daily and call if you see any redness, drainage, pus, or other changes that conc ern you. Dressings and Staples You will have a gauze dres sing placed over the su rgical incision in the operating room. The outer dressing us ually consists of a layer of gauze held by tape. The original outer dressing is removed either in the hospital, or at home 48 hours after th e procedure. Looking at a surgical incision for the first time can be stre ssful. It may be helpful to have a family member of close friend with you to help remove the outer dressing. Inguinal surgical areas ar e held together with metal staples or sutures. Sutures and staples provide strength to hold the incision closed. They will remain in place until the incision area is healed. The surgical team will monitor your incision and decide when to remove the sutures/staples. This is done 14-21 days after surgery. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 39 Beginning Other Activities You sh ould plan on being at bedrest, with your leg elevated, most of the time for the first week afte r the surgery. Lying in a recliner or sofa with the leg elevated is also acceptable. Avoid sitting for prolon ged periods - the only exceptions are the bathroom and the dinner table. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 40 Special Instructions after Axilla r y Lymph Node Dissection Surgery Exercising / Movement (This section has been reproduced with permission from: Exercises Following Axillary Surgery; a UMHS booklet writte n by Mary Wakefield, PT with support from The Division of Physical Ther apy of the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department and the Breast Care Center) The following activities have been appr oved by your phys ician to help you increase the motion and strength of yo ur shoulder and improve your posture after surgery. Your physician or the nur se specialist can answer more specific questions you might have: for example, when to expect full range of motion and the amount of weight you may lift when exercising yo ur operated arm. When Should I Start? Exercises should be started immediately following surgery. Several exercises require above-the-shoulder movement an d should be started after the drains are removed. These exercises are bo xed and noted as \"drain out only\" exercises. Why Should I Exercise? Posture exercises are important because there is a tendency after surgery to \"protect\" the surgical area, which ofte n leads to poor posture. The poor posture over time can lead to upper ba ck and neck problems. The shoulder mobility exercises are done to prevent a frozen shoulder, which can occur very quickly when the shoulder is not used. A frozen shoulder can be very painful, so it's essential that you begin the sh oulder mobility exercises as soon as possible, refer to the descriptions below. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 41 When Can Exercises Be Discontinued? Exe rcises can be discontinued when your posture is good, you can perform all the mobility and strengthening exercises with ease, an d you are using your arm for everyday activities. Posture Your posture, or the way you carry your head, neck and trunk, will ultimately affect the movement of your should er. Maintaining correct posture will increase your overall comfor t in the post-operative pe riod. It is helpful to correct your posture by look ing in a mirror frequently during the day. Check to see that your back is erect as possible, shoulders are level and that your chin is tucked. Perform these exercises slowly, 10 repetiti ons each, twice daily. Continue until they become part of your regular daily ac tivities. Posture Exercises Exercise A: Chin Tuck: Sitting in a relaxed position, back erec t, move your head backwards as far as possible, tucking in your chin. Make a double chin as you continue looking straig ht ahead. Hold for 5 seconds, relax and repeat. (see illustration below) Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 42 Exe rcise B: Shrug your shoulders up and toward your ears, hold for 5 seconds, relax and repeat. (see illustration below) Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 43 Exercise C: Squeeze your shoulder blades together, hold for 5 seconds, relax a nd repeat. (see illustration below) Exer cise D: Roll your shoulders up, ba ck and down in a circular motion, relax and repeat. (see illustration below) Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 44 Shoulder Mobility Using your arm in daily functional activi ties is an excellent means of regaining the shoulder mobility that you had before surgery. Some examples of these activities are: washing and brushing you hair, drying your back with a towel, fastening your brassiere, letting your arms sw ing as you walk an d reaching into cabinets. The following ex ercises will help you regain full shoulder mobility. Perform these exercises slowly 5 repetiti ons each, twice daily. Continue these exercises until full arm mobility is achieved. Mobility Exercises Perform this exercise only AFTER drains are removed Exercise E: While standing ar m length away from the wall: 1.Face the wall, slowly walk both hands up the wall as far as possible. Step toward the wall, lean into the arm, hold for 5 seconds, relax and repeat. 2.Turn your side to the wall, slowly walk your affected hand up the wall as far as possible. Step toward the wall, lean into the arm, hold for 5 seconds, relax and repeat. (see illustration below) Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 45 Exer cise F: While sitting erect with hand s at nape of neck, move elbows forward touch together and then push elbows apart, relax and repeat (see illustration below) Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 46 Exercise G: While sitting erect, pu t han ds on shoulders and circle elbow forward up, out and down. Repeat . (see illustration below) Perf orm this exercise only AFTER drains are removed Exercise H: While sitting or lying down, clasp hands, lift arms up and over your head. Keep elbows as straight as possible, relax and repeat. (see illustration below) Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 47 Perf orm this exercise only AFTER drains are removed Exercise I: While sitting or lying down, move your arms outward away from your sides, clasp hands overhead; return to sides. Keep elbows straight, relax and repeat. (see illustration below) Increasing Arm Strength Daily functi onal activities and hobbies will also help to increase your arm strength. Some examples of these activities ar e grocery shopping, doing laundry, washing the car and preparing me als. For the firs t eight weeks after surgery, strengthening for the operated si de is limited to li fting 10 pounds or less. After that time, chec k with your physician about lifting heavier loads. The following exercises are design ed to help you regain the strength you had before your operation. Remember to always warm up your arm with the mobility exercises before performing strengthening work. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 48 Perform these exercises slowly, 5 repeti tions each, twice da ily. Gradually increase the number of repetitions as tole rated. Continue these exercises until full preoperative st rength is achieved. St rengthening Exercises Exercise J: Standing tall, and faci ng a wall, put both hands on the wall at shoulder height. Start with your elbows bent. Push away from the wall, straightening your elbows an d rounding your back. Hold for 5 seconds, relax and repeat. (see illustration below) Exer cise K: Sitting erect, hands in fron t of your chest, with elbows bent, push the heels of your palms together fo r 5 seconds. Hook your fingers together and pull 5 seconds, rela x and repeat the sequence. (see illustration below) Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 49 Exe rcise L: Sitting or standing erect, with arms at your side, hold a 2-pound weight in each hand and swing your arms back. Hold for 5 seconds, relax and repeat. (see illustration below) Perf orm this exercise only AFTER drains are removed Exercise M: Sitting with your back supported, hold a 2-pound weight and bend your elbow; then lift your arm as far as comfortable toward the ceiling. Alternate arms. (see illustration below) Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 50 Beginning Other Activities As you become more comfor table with your improved mobility and strength you may want to gradually return to an enjoyable sp ort or get involved in a structured exercise program. Participat ion in water exercise classes or dance classes with emphasis on gentle sust ained upper extremity movement may be useful. A recommended program would meet 2 to 3 time s weekly, consisting of a warm-up with slow stretchi ng exercises, followed by the primary activity, and ending with a cool-down session. Chec k with your physician for details about when you may begin these activities. Important Tips to Remember Activity Maintain good posture habi ts throughout the day. Perform your exercises slowly, twice daily Do not lift more than 10 pounds for 8 weeks following your surgery. This means you cannot lift children, purses, suitcases, cats, dogs, groceries or garbage heavier than 10 pounds . (a gallon of milk weighs 9 pounds). It also means pushing a grocery cart, pushing yourself out of bed, or pulling yo urself up using the bed siderails cannot be done using your affected arm. Do use your arm in daily activities. Swelling If you notice slight swelling or tightness in your arm, the swelling may be decreased by squeezing a ball in your hand while keeping your armelevated higher than your heart. Alert your physician or nurse specialist if you are experiencing persistent swelling. Notify them that you have had lymph nodes removed. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 51 Swelli ng can be caused by eating sa lty foods or can occur on hot days. Infection When your lymph nodes are removed, you will need to watch for the following signs of infection: redness swelling warmth tenderness in your arm Notify your physician or nurse specialist if you experience any of these. Special Instructions a fter Skin Graft Surgery Whether you have a split thickness or full thickness skin graft you will probably go home after surgery. However, in rare cases you may be admitted to the UMHS Observation Unit overnight. Care of the Graft Site The graft site will have a special dressing called a \"bolster\" dressing. This lies directly under a bulky dressing. The bolster dressing will be either stapled or sutured to keep the skin graft from moving. It is important that the graft stay in the correct place. At the first postoperative visit these sutures or staples will be removed and the skin graft evaluated. Often times, additional st aples or sutures hold the new skin in place; these will be left in place for another 5-7 days. The skin graft will heal over the next seve ral weeks. It will leave a scar as will the donor site. It will fade over time but it will not look like normal skin. DO NOT remove your surgical dressing. This will be done at your 1st postoperative visit Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 52 Other post operative care recommendations include: S kin grafts placed on your arm or le g: Elevate the ar m or leg above the level of your heart for much of the day and night. It is important to avoid swelling of the arm or leg as it will effect how the graft heals. Skin grafts placed on your leg: You will need to use crut ches or a walker until directed by your surgeon or nurse practitioner . These will be ordered for you at the time of your pre-operative visit. Skin grafts placed on your trunk or upper arm: You may not lift more than 5-10 pounds until directed by yo ur surgeon or nurs e practitioner. All skin grafts: No shower or soak ing in a bath until directed, No driving until directed. What special care do I need after skin graft surgery? Do not disturb your dressing Do not get your skin graft dressing wet. You will need to sponge bath until your doctor or nurse practition er gives you permission to shower. If the surgery site is on your arm or leg, you will need to keep the arm or leg elevated above the level of your he art for most of the day and night. It is important to avoid swelling of the arm or leg as it will affect graft healing. You will be instructed at your postoperative visit as to when you can increase your activity. If the surgery site is on your leg, you will be given a prescription for crutches/walker at your preoperative history and physical. You will not be able to put any weight on your leg for 1-2 weeks. Your nurse Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 53 practitioner or physician will tell you w hen you can begin to increase the amount of weight placed on your leg. You may require a spli nt or sling. You will begin daily dressing changes once the bolster dressing is removed in the clinic postoperatively. Your clinic nurse will teach you how to perform the dressing changes. Skin Graft Dressings Dressing changes to the surgery site wi ll be done once a da y after your first postoperative visit. Do not change any dressings until instructed by your doctor or nurse practitioner . The procedure is: Wash your hands Remove the outer dressing Carefully remove the inner dressing, taking care of not topull off the skin graft Evaluate the surgical area for signs of infection: redness, drainage (pus), odor Place either a Xeroform \u00ae or Vaseline\u00ae gauze directly on the graft, folding the edges of the dressing over so they do not lay on your normal skin (your doctor or nurse practitioner will tell you which type to use) Fluff one or two 4x4 gauze dre ssing pieces and place on top Cover with plain 4x4 ga uze or an 'ABD' pad Wrap with either kerlex or ace as directed Replace the splint or sling as indicated Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 54 You will be given a prescription for the supp lies you will need. These can be obtained at your local me dical supply comp any or pharmacy. Please note, many insurance companies do no t cover dressing supplies. You will return to the clinic 5-7 days af ter the bolster dressing is removed to have the remaining sutures/staples remo ved and the graft evaluated. You will continue your dressing changes as instructed at this visit. Care of the Donor Site Once the skin graft is removed from the do nor site a dressing is placed over the donor site and stapled in place. The care of the donor site will depend on the type of graft you have; spli t or full thickness. Full thickness grafts: This type of dono r site is closed like an incision with absorbable sutures and/or glue. Split thickness grafts: Several types of dressings can be used to heal donor sites for a split thickness skin graft. Your surgeon will decide which type is used. They include: Xeroform\u00ae 1. It is yellow in colo r and may b e stapled in place. 2 . T h e s i t e w i l l d r a i n and be moist after surgery. 3. Use a hair dryer on a low setting and blow-dry the donor site ar ea for 10 minutes daily. 4. The staples will be removed at your first postoperative visit 5. Over 2-3 weeks the dressi ngs should dry up and the edges peel back until it is completely off the skin. The edges can be trimmed with a clean pair of scissors daily if needed. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 55 Tegaderm\u00ae1. A clear plastic film. 2. This dressing is left in place. 3. Contact your clinic nu rse practitioner if you have drainage or the dressi ng becomes loose. Put a dry dressing over the Tegaderm\u00ae and contact the clinic. Acticoat\u00ae1. It is a fabric dressing, metallic in color. 2. It is stapled into place. The staples will be removed in about 5 days. 3. Acticoat\u00ae is kept slightly moist with water for the first five days. 4. After five days, the Acticoat\u00ae must be kept dry. 5. The Acticoat\u00ae will become like a scab. 6. The edges will begin to lift and then can be trimmed dfddfff with a clean pair of scissors. 7. It should be off co mpletely within 10-14 days. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 56 Lymphedema Th e following is a reprint of the PDQ statement on lymphedema written by cancer experts for health professionals and published by the National Cancer Institute. This and other credible information about cancer treatment, screening, prevention, supportive care, an d ongoing trials, is available from the NCI. Lymphedema is the buildup of lymph (a fluid that helps fight infection and disease) in the fatty tissues just under the skin. The buildu p of lymph causes swelling in specific areas of the body, us ually an arm or leg, with an abnormally high amount of tissue proteins, chro nic inflammation, and thickening and scarring of tissue under the skin. Lymphedema is a common complication of cancer and cancer treatment and ca n result in long-term physical, psychological, and social issues for patients. See Figure 5. The lymphatic system consis ts of a network of specialized lymphatic vessels and various tissues and organs througho ut the body that contain lymphocytes (white blood cells) and other cells that help the body fight infection and disease. The lymphatic vessels are similar to veins but have th inner walls. Some of these vessels are very close to the skin surface and can be found near veins; others are just under the skin and in th e deeper fatty tissue s near the muscles and can be found near arteries. Muscles and valves within the walls of the lymphati c vessels near the skin surface help pick up fluid and proteins from tissues throug hout the body and move the lymph in one dire ction, toward the heart. Lymph is slowly moved through larger and larger lymphatic vessels and passes through small bean- shaped structures called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes filter substances that can be harmful to the body and contain lymp hocytes and other cells that activate the immune system to fight disease. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 57 Eventually, lymp h flows into one of two large ducts in the neck region. The right lymphatic du ct collects lymph from the right arm and the right side of the head and chest and empties into the large vein under the right collarbone. The left lymphatic duct or thoracic duct collec ts lymph from both legs, the left arm and the left side of the head and chest and empties into the large vein under the left collar bone. The lymphatic system collects excess fluid and proteins from the body tissues and carries them back to the bloodstream. Proteins and substances too big to move through the walls of veins can be picked up by the Figure 5: Lymphedema of the Leg lymphatic vessels because they have thinner walls. Edema may occur when there is an increase in the amount of fluid, proteins, and other substances in the body tissues because of problems in the blood capillaries and veins or a blockage in the ly mphatic system. Lymphedema may be either primary or secondary. Primary lymphedema is a rare inherited condition in which lymph nodes and lymph vessels are absent or abnormal. Secondary lymphedema can be caused by a blockage or cut in the Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 58 lymphatic system, usually the lymph nodes in the gr o in area and the armpit. Blockages may be caused by infection, cancer, or scar tiss ue from radiation therapy or surgical removal of lymph nodes. This summary discusses secondary lymphedema. Acute versus gradual-onset lymphedema There are four types of acute lymphedema . The first type of acute lymphedema is mild and lasts only a short time, occu rring within a few days after surgery to remove the lymph nodes or injury to the lymphatic vessels or veins just under the collarbone. The affected limb may be warm and slightly re d, but is usually not painful and gets better within a week after keeping the affected arm or leg supported in a raised position and by contracting the muscles in the affected limb (for example, making a fist and releasing it). The second type of acute lymphedema occurs 6 to 8 weeks after surgery or during a course of radiation therapy. Th is type may be caused by inflammation of either lymphatic vessels or veins. The affected limb is tender, warm or hot, and red and is treated by keeping the limb supported in a raised position and taking anti-inflammatory drugs. The third type of acute lymp hedema occurs after an inse ct bite, minor injury, or burn that causes an infection of the skin and th e lymphatic vessels near the skin surface. It may occur on an arm or leg that is chronically swollen. The affected area is red, very tender, an d hot and is treated by supporting the affected arm or leg in a raised positi on and taking antibiotics. Use of a compression pump or wrapping the affect ed area with elastic bandages should not be done during the ea rly stages of infection. Mild redness may continue after the infection. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 59 The fourth and most common type of acute lymphedema develops very slowly and may become noticeable 18 to 24 mo nths after surgery or not until many years after cancer tr eatment. The patient may experi ence discomfort of the skin or aching in the neck and shoulders or spine and hips caused by stretching of the soft tissues, overuse of muscles, or posture changes caused by increased weight of the arm or leg. Temporary versu s chronic lymphedema Temporary lymphedema is a condition that lasts less than 6 months. The skin indents when pressed and stays indented, but there is no hardening of the skin. A patient may be more like ly to develop lymphedema if he or she has: surgical drains that leak prot ein into the surgical site inflammation an inability to move the limb(s) temporary loss of lymphatic function blockage of a vein by a blood cl ot or inflammation of a vein. Chronic (long-term) lymphedema is the mo st difficult of all types of edema to treat. The damaged lymphatic system of the affected area is no t able to keep up with the increased need fo r fluid drainage from the body tissues. This may happen: after a tumor recurs or spreads to the lymph nodes after an infection and/or inju ry of the lymp hatic vessels after periods of not being able to move the limbs after radiation therapy or surgery when early signs of lymp hedema have not been able to be controlled when a vein is blocked by a blood clot. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 60 Risk factors Fac tors that can lead to the developm ent of lymphedema include radiation therapy to an area where the lymph nodes were surgically removed, problems after surgery that cause inflammation of the arm or leg, the number of lymph nodes removed in surgery, and being elderly. Patients who are at risk for lymphedema are those with: Radiation therapy to the underarm area after surgical removal of the lymph nodes. The number of lymph no des removed increases the risk of lymphedema. Surgical removal of lymph nodes in the underarm, groin, or pelvic regions. Radiation therapy to the underarm, gr oin, pelvic, or neck regions. Scar tissue in the lympha tic ducts or veins, under the collarbones, caused by surgery or radiation therapy. Cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes in the neck, chest, underarm, pelvis, or abdomen. Tumors growing in the pelvis or abdomen that put pressure on the lymphatic vessels and/or the large ly mphatic duct in the chest and block lymph drainage inadequate diet or those who are ov erweight. These conditions may delay recovery and in crease the risk for lymphedema. Prevention Patients at risk for lymp h e d e m a s h o u l d b e i d e n t i f i ed early, monitored, and taught self-care. A patient may be more likely to develop lymphedema if he or Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 61 she eats an inadequate di et, is overweight, is inac tive, or has other medical problems. To detect the condition early, the following should be examined: comparison of actual weight to ideal weight measurements of the arms and legs protein levels in the blood ability to perform activi ties of daily living history of edema, previous radiation therapy, or surgery other medical illnesses, such as di abetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, heart disease, or phlebitis (inflammation of the veins). It is important that the pa tient know about his or he r disease and the risk of developing lymphedema. Poor drainage of the lymphatic system due to surgery to remove the lymph nodes or radiation therapy may make the affected arm or leg more susceptible to serious infectio n. Even a small infection may lead to serious lymphedema. Patients should be taught about arm, leg, and skin care after surgery and/or radiation. It is im portant that patients take precautions to prevent injury and infection in the affe cted arm or leg, si nce lymphedema can occur 30 or more years after surgery. Lymphatic drainage is improved during ex ercise; therefore exercise is important in preventing lymphedema. Patients should do hand and arm exercises as instructed after upper extremity lymp h node removal. Pa tients who have surgery that affects pelvic lymph node drainage should do leg and foot exercises as instructed. Th e doctor decides how soon patients should start exercising after surgery. Physiatrists (doctors who specialize in physical medicine and rehabi litation) or physical ther apists should develop an individualized exercise pr ogram for the patient. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 62 Better recovery occurs when lymphedema is discovered early, so patients should be taught to recogn ize the early signs of edem a and to tell the doctor about any of the following symptoms: feelings o f tightness in the arm or leg rings or shoes that become tight weakness in the arm or leg pain, aching, or heavine ss in the arm or leg redness, swelling, or signs of infection. Treatment Lymphedema is treated by physical methods and wi th medication. Physical methods include supporting the arm or leg in a raised position; manual lymphatic drainage (a specia lized form of very light ma ssage that helps to move fluid from the end of the limb toward the trunk of the body); wearing custom- fitted clothes that apply co ntrolled pressure around the affected limb; and cleaning the skin carefully to prevent infection. Lymphedema may be treated by combining several therapies. This is known as complex physical therapy (or complex deco ngestive therapy), which consists of manual lymphedema trea tment, compression wrapping, individualized exercises, and skin care, followed by a maintenance program. Complex physical therapy must be performed by a profe ssional trained in the techniques. Surgery for treating lymphedema usually results in complications and is seldom recommended for cancer patients. Multidisciplinary Surgical Oncology Clinic Melanoma Surgery Patient Handbook 63 Psychosocial considerations Because lymphedema is disfiguring and so metimes painful and disabling, it can create mental, physical, and sexual pr oblems. The added stresses associated with lymphedema may interfere with treatm ent that is often painful, difficult, and time-consuming. Patients with lymphedema may be helped by group an d individual counseling that provides information about ways to prevent lymphedema, the role of diet and exercise, advice for picking comf ortable and flattering clothes, and emotional support.
