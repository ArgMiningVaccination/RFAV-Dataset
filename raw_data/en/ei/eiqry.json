Do you keep getting colds, bugs and flus? Aromatherapy massage and reflexology can help! If you think your immune system may need a helping hand there are a number of things you can try. It is a well-known that stress inhibits the immune system, so your first step should be to reduce stress levels. By bringing the body into a deep state of relaxation, both reflexology and aromatherapy massage can be beneficial. Aromatherapy massage has the added benefit of essential oils, which are excellent immune system boosters. My favourites for treating coughs, colds, catarrh, sinus and flu are basil, ginger and lavender. In addition, supplements and changes to diet may help to support you through times of illness. Healthly living tips, such as diet, exercise and sleep are discussed during your treatment. Regular treatments aid the healing process and allow the body and mind to regain a calmer and more balanced rhythm. Think these treatments may be of benefit to you? Want to find out more?

However, many would agree that aromatherapy adds a beneficial layer to treatments. The use of plants for medicine is an ancient tradition. Aromatherapy employs techniques such inhalation and massage. Both of these routes of administration are safe if used in the correct quantities. Inhalation affects the limbic system, the part of central nervous system which deals with memory and emotion. Massage treatment allows the oils to be absorbed into the blood stream, and the massage itself affects the nervous system. Relaxation or stimulation of the nervous system depends upon which aromatherapy oils and massage techniques are used. The goal of the aromatherapist is to assess each client and create a bespoke blend. By looking at the properties of essential oils we can create blends for specific conditions for each individual. Research into the field of aromatherapy is somewhat scarce, however studies do exist. For example, a systematic review of Lavender oil for poor sleep suggested lavender was of benefit [[1]](file:///C:/Users/San/Documents/Clinic/Blog/Aromatherapy.docx#_ftn1). A more recent study showed a positive link between Lavender and stress reduction [[2]](file:///C:/Users/San/Documents/Clinic/Blog/Aromatherapy.docx#_ftn2). With regards to massage and aromatherapy used together, a study found improvements in knee pain when a blend of orange and ginger were used [[3]](file:///C:/Users/San/Documents/Clinic/Blog/Aromatherapy.docx#_ftn3).
