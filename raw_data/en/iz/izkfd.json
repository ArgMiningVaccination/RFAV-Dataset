Use this guide to find the right balance bike for your toddler! Balance bikes are perfect for a toddler over the tricycle but not quite ready for a regular pedal bike. If you're looking for a new and better way to teach your toddler to ride a bike, a balance bike is what you've been looking for! One of the key benefits is that it can help them develop their balance and coordination skills from an early age, making it much easier for them to learn how to ride a traditional two-wheeled bicycle when they get bigger. Balance bikes are easy-to-use and will provide countless benefits for your child now and in the future. Learn more about balance bikes and find the best balance bike for your child below! How do Balance Bikes Work? Balance bikes are a revolutionary way for kids to learn to ride a bike without using training wheels. If you grew up using training wheels as I did, prepare to try something new. Approach balance bikes with an open mind. Balance bikes are very different from conventional bikes because they have no wheels or pedals. So to ride a balance bike, your little rider will just sit on the bike with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground. They will use their legs to push the bike forward and glide in a balanced, upright position. At first, your little one may just walk while resting their bottom on the bike's saddle. This is normal, and it may take them some time to get the hang of it. Stick with it through this phase. Eventually, they will be able to coast on the bike and eventually glide around almost like they were riding a regular bike. Here's a great clip of a 2 year old learning how to use a balance bike. As you can probably see from this short clip, the benefit of using a balance bike instead of a conventional bike (or a bike with training wheels) is that it gives your child the ability to learn to ride centered and balanced and provides more freedom of movement. When your little one is ready to transition to a big kid bike with pedals, they'll already have the motion down and know how to balance themselves. No wobbly training wheels needed! A balance bike is perfect for as young as 18 months and can be used through toddlerhood until your little one is ready for a traditional pedal bike. For some kids, this can be as young as age 3, while others might wait until ages 5 or 6.

The Size As mentioned, the right size bike is critical for a safe ride for young children. And by size, I am talking about a few bike parts. This includes the seat height, the weight, and the wheel diameter. Seat Height The best way to determine what seat height to look for is to measure your child's inseam length from the groin to the bottom of their feet. This should give you a good idea of how high a bike seat should be from the ground. When standing, the seat should fall about one inch below the crotch and the handlebars should be leveled around the stomach. When sitting, your child should be able to put their feet flat on the ground, with their weight resting on the bike saddle. I always recommend choosing a balance bike with an adjustable seat height so that the bike can keep up with your fast-growing toddler! Bicycle Weight The weight of the bike is also something to keep in mind. A young toddler, for example, does not need a heavy bike. In fact, for a younger child, the bike should be extremely lightweight so they can feel in control of the bike. It will also ensure that the bike's weight will not hurt if your little one takes a tumble. Wheel Size You'll see wheel sizes range from 10 inches up to 14 inches. Most riders will want 12-inch wheels to start. If your child is very young (18 months) or on the smaller side, you can look at bikes with 10-inch wheels. And if you have a taller kiddo or your child is just starting to ride a bike at age 5, you might purchase a bike with 14-inch wheels. The Fit In addition to the size, you want to set your toddler on the bike to make sure with the adjustments, the bike properly fits your child. First, set your kiddo on the bike seat. They should be able to have their feet flat on the ground when sitting. And they should also be able to put all their weight on the seat (no balancing act required to sit down!). Your little one should also be able to reach the handlebars easily while sitting upright; there should not be too much lean involved. Next, you'll have your child stand up. The handlebars should be at stomach height, and he should be able to stand up comfortably over the stand-through. The Tire Type Tires can be particularly important to both the safety of the ride but also how it feels for your toddler. Plastic Wheels Plastic wheels, for example, do not offer a great grip on the ground and the feedback plastic wheels give can feel unsteady. I don't recommend plastic wheels. Foam Wheels These don't have much compression and can feel pretty solid, so the feedback for these wheels will be similar to that of a plastic wheel. However, they do have more traction than a plastic wheel. The good thing about foam wheels is that they are virtually maintenance-free. No air required! Foam tires are also extremely lightweight, so they won't add much weight to the bike frame itself. Air Wheels This is what I generally recommend. They provide good traction and are pretty smooth when going over bumps and whatnot. This type of tire will feel fairly secure for your new rider. Keep in mind, like any regular tire, they do require you to add air as needed. Brakes Without pedals, you don't have pedal brakes! However, some newer balance bikes might have a hand brake or. foot brake. This can be useful for older children who may go faster on their balance bikes. Having a hand or foot brake also saves the shoes! Those soles get a lot of wear as kids generally will stop with their feet if a bike does not have a handbrake. Again, the hand brake isn't necessary for younger kiddos just learning to ride, but consider it for older, faster riders. Other Rules of Thumb - Consider the safety features overall as you select a bike for your little one. - Make sure there is space between the seat and handlebars. - If the bike has a hand brake, make sure the brake is easy enough for your child to grasp. - Make sure the handlebar is comfortable for your child (not too thick for your child's hand to wrap around). - Feet should touch the ground! Since the bike is propelled (and stopped) by those little feet, they need to comfortably touch the ground. - Make sure no sharp screws or other metal pieces stick out as they could scratch your child's legs. - Check the weight of the bike. It should not be heavy! Happy Riding! I hope this guide helps you and your toddler pick out just the right balance bike to start cycling on the right foot. Any of these balance bikes will provide a wonderful first bike experience. Remember not to push your toddler into cycling; give it time and be patient, and your little one will eventually find joy in learning to ride.
