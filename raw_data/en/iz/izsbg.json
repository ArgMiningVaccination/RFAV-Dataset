Gordon, M.D., a psychiatrist who runs the Center for Mind -Body Medicine in Washington, D.C., and the nuanced approach to recovery from mental health conditions that he advocates in Unstuck,16 which describes recovery as a spiritual pa th. The quest for mental wellness and recovery from mental and emotional setbacks is fundamental to everyone's path in life. Any search for insight into one's life purpose, any quest for knowledge of the self, must treat mental adversity as an opportunity for growth and for enlightenment. That is the spiritual core of the recovery concept. And it is in that spirit that this outline is offered, for those on the quest. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents INTRODUCTION When should people interested in mental healt h and overall wellness consider using CAM treatments? Dialog ue for Recovery and Thriving Mindset Intent of This Outline The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) Why do People Use CAM? Information Needed What Works? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration MHA and CAM GLOSSARY --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents When should people interested in mental health and overall wellness consider using CAM treatments? This outline is a comparative research -based approach to that question. While some activities, like exercise, are good for everyone who is physically able to do them and have no uncontrollable side effec ts, most decisions about CAM treatment options, and especially the decisions faced by people coping with serious mental health conditions, involve trade -offs. Nonetheless, 40% or more of Americans treat themselves with CAM without professional supervision, often without disclosing it to their psychiatrist or primary care provider. Moreover, many patients who use CAM remedies also take prescription antidepressants, risking potentially dangerous adverse herb/drug interactions. While most natural psycho tropics are generally safe, they are not risk free, and the common public misconception that natural products are inherently safe has been refuted by predictions and reports of toxic reactions from these agents, which may be due to intrinsic toxicity, contaminati on, or interaction with other herbs or drugs. People considering using CAM treatments need to make an informed decision , just as they would with any synthetic medication or other treatment , weighing the evidence about effectiveness, drug interactions, side effects, and less dangerous options, to come up with a risk/benefit assessment . These are the issues that any physician must consider, and that anyone considering CAM treatment should consider. But the blizzard of competing claims poses a real challenge t o getting efficient access to reliable evidence about safety and efficacy. This effort is an attempt to help fill this void. Mental Health America hopes that its new website will fill this void. By putting all of the recommendations not tied to product adv ertising in one place, side-by-side, Mental Health America hopes to help health care providers and consumers be better informed about the principal non -traditional options available and the evidence that supports them. Mental Health America and other large mental health advocacy groups have never previously taken a positionprovided systematic information on supplements., which have been used extensively by consumers based on word of mouth recommendations, in the CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents absence of reliable advice about risks or ef ficacy. With the publication of this website, Mental Health America hopes to remedy this oversight. Dialog ue for Recovery and Thriving Mindset MHA has another website, Dialog ue for Recovery, which may help consumers to navigate the issues that need to be faced to get optimal treatment for mental health conditions. (http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/go/recovery ) If you live with mental illness, you may be struggling to find treatment, manage your medication and cope with life's challenges effectively. There is ample cause for hope. You are not alone, help is available, mental health conditions are treatable, and you can take practical steps to recover your life. On this site, you'll find inte ractive tools and resources to help you better understand your treatment options, work closely with your health care provider, learn about the supports available to you, and start on your recovery journey. Use the Dialog ue for Recovery tools to open up communication with your health care provider . Educate yourself about treatment options , paying for care, and getting the most from your treatment. Get practical advice on handling many challenges you might be facing, like finding the right medication, securing housing, pursuing educa tion and work, and managing money. On this site, you will find information about how to start and maintain your recovery and live your richest, fullest life. Friends and loved ones will also find information here about how best to support you in your journey to recovery and wellness . This outline and the more specific treatment options CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents described on the MHA website should be read in the context of MH A's strong advice to seek a supportive partnership with heath care providers as the best foundation for durable recovery. Thriving Mindset is a highly interactive Apple iPad application comprising a video course that provides the user with eighteen, 8 -10 m inute daily lessons designed to teach one how to change their perceptions and emotional behavior to create and nurture a \"thriving mindset.\" Each day, the user is introduced to a new concept about how one develops and sustains a positive outlook on life. Following the short, highly professional video featuring some of the top scientists and academics in the positive psychology field, the user is offered additional information on the daily subject, including a link to one of the ten supporting wellness tra cks the on the MHA website, \"Live Your Life Well,\" described in this outline. Users also have the opportunity at the end of each lesson to experience a recommended iPad wellness application available from the Apple Store that reinforces the lesson of the day that they can then upload into an individually -tailored dashboard for quick daily reference. Finally, at the end of each lesson, users will be shown a featured product of the day that also complements the daily lesson. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of t hese products will support MHA. Thriving Mindset was developed through a partnership between MHA and bLife, Inc., a for - profit technology company. Intent of This Outline By disseminating MHA's synthesis of the information and analysis gle aned primarily from ten prominent sources, this outline is intended to help you, as consumers, advocates, physicians, and other health care practitioners, to evaluate potential CAM treatments. It is better to evaluate them with the help of a clinician, wit h a physical examination and a global wellness perspective, to deal with side effects, physical illness challenges, co -occurring conditions and CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents drug interactions, and to titrate dosages through clinical observation of effects. But even if a clinician is no t involved, all of these factors must be considered. That is the daunting task taken on by consumers under the American model of CAM, largely outside our private health care system and our public drug regulatory system, with minimal quality control, withou t requirements for standardized formulations, and often without professional guidance for appropriate use by consumers. This outline compiles evaluations of the CAM treatments most studied, recommended and used for mental health conditions, based on the ten principal sources. MHA recognizes that there are significant inconsistencies and methodological limitations in the published evidence, and only a few CAM studies meet rigorous scientific standards. Large, long -term, dose -differential studies are needed, as are comparative effectiveness and patient outcome studies, but few exist for these CAM treatments. This outline will stress the evidence for those CAM treatments that have been proven (to the level of being judged \"promising\") effective with acceptable risk in credible clinical trials . Whenever possible, it is MHA's intent to compare the findings of the ten sources, making this outline a kind of \"meta -review.\" It will also point to recommended but less well documented treatments. Depending on the risk, t hese are potential avenues of experimentation if more documented alternatives have failed to provide relief. N one of the CAM trea tments surveyed in this outline is truly proven as evidence -based to federal government drug -approval standards. These evaluat ions will change as new evidence is developed. MHA will try to update the outline with new evidence and corrections as needed, but the outline is current ONLY through the end of 2012 until this sentence is revised to show the change. Some authors, and nota bly Drs. Richard Brown, Patricia Gerbarg, and Philip Muskin, authors of How to Use Herbs, Nutrients and Yoga in Mental Health Care , (\"Brown et al .,\" 2009), and one of the principal sources for this outline, take a comprehensive perspective, providing evid ence for CAM treatments, based on supported by well -controlled studies, open trials, and their own clinical observations. This approach, derived from both research literature and extensive clinical experience, is thorough and suggestive, and an invaluable resource for people wanting to go CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents further in considering less -tested CAM treatments, when better -tested treatments have not worked well enough to promote recovery. The clinical insights described by Brown et al . are an invaluable adjunct to academic stud ies and point the way to future studies that may expand on the material medica described in this outline. However, MHA's focus is on comparative evaluations of those CAM treatments that have been evaluated by multiple sources. Clinical experience is not o ften documented in the comprehensive way undertaken by Brown et al ., and is best studied by reading this important book and Brown and Ge rbarg's related work directly. Whenever possible, this outline, unlike a package insert for a prescription drug, will a ttempt to give a survey of the evidence for and against each proposed CAM treatment. Side effects and drug interactions will be discussed, based on clinical practice and the evidence from the available trials. A long list of potential side effects and pote ntial drug interactions is inevitable, but aside from drug interactions assessed by prescribing physicians, such lists are seldom read and routinely ignored. The challenge for the consumer is the estimation of risk and benefit. This outline will give the s ources' evaluations whenever possible, or those of peer reviewers, when the concern is likely more theoretical than real, as is often the case with the potential concerns raised by the Natural Standard . This is the information most conspicuously missing fr om prescription package inserts, driven in part by liability concerns. CAUTION IS IN ORDER. What is unproven today may be proven tomorrow, and vice -versa. This is an outline of CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, AS OF THE END OF 2012, and it documents disagreem ents which should be resolved in time. There are many potentially beneficial CAM treatments for which more evidence is needed. However, when the risks are low, practitioners and consumers may choose to do a trial of such treatments while further informatio n is being developed. WE STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN. It may be helpful to add an observation about AUTONOMY AND HOPE . In the American model of CAM, the consumer has complete autonomy in selecting nutritional supplements and can try even dangerous supplement s without a prescription. This autonomy means that only the consumer's own knowledge and tolerance for risk informs the decision about which CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents supplements to choose and which information to trust. This outline is an effort to aid consumers in making those ch oices and to further educate the professionals who advise them. If the potential consumer is getting care from a physician or other health care practitioner, it is important to discuss CAM treatments with that person to avoid unintended drug or herb inter actions and to tailor the overall treatment to the consumer's individual, evolving needs. But it is also important to realize that as treatment proceeds, the consumer may need to consider alternatives and to experience the hope that comes from trying new t reatments that may improve quality of life. One of the worst aspects of mental illness is the fear of losing control over one's own mine, and therefore, one's ability to direct one's own treatment and recovery . One of the functions of CAM in America is to reserve freedom to the \"patient\" to direct a po rtion of the treatment spectrum without prior medical authorization. This places the obligation on professionals to engage in candid dialogue with their clients on the subjects covered by this outline. It also places a moral obligation on the person seeking treatment to discuss CAM remedies used or desired. A successful working relationship is the ultimate goal of the therapeutic alliance. Consumers' experimentation with CAM treatments can be helpful in the rec overy process if they successfully harness the inner reserves of strength associated with choosing one's own treatment, ideally in tandem with a trusted clinician. This outline has not been written to encourage innovation and risk -taking, but to recognize that people seek their own remedies when the medical system fails to meet their needs for any reason. MHA's intent is to make the available evidence and analysis known so that consumers and practitioners can work together better and make respo nsible choic es. THIS OUTLINE CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE . MHA is an advocacy organization and does not provide treatment advice. This outline merely assembles the evidence compiled and analyzed by others - principally the ten sources listed above. M ore importantly, mental health conditions are complex, people differ widely in their conditions and responses, and interactions with other conditions and treatments are best evaluated by a CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents physical examination and consultation with a qualified clinician. M HA suggests that this outline is a good starting point to discuss potential CAM treatments with your physician or other health care practitioner. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) CAM treatments for mental health condi tions have not been extensively studied in large, long - term, randomized, double -blind, active -placebo -controlled trials , and even those that seem promising in meta -analyses (which combine comparable studies to increase the reliability of a set of clinical studies) have not been \"proven\" to the satisfaction of The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). Formal review and elaborate research projects are expensive processes. It takes gold to pay for the \"gold standard,\" and the lack of patentable products has discouraged research, except in Germany, where popular reliance on CAM and government -sponsored health care that encourages it have led to recent promising randomized clinical trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies that ma rket CAM remedies. So we really don't have much accepted science to go on. As the NCCAM website shows, while most of the CAM treatments discussed in this outline have been acknowledged as promising, NONE has yet received federal (FDA, NCCAM or AHRQ) reco gnition for use as a psychotropic agent. But people have been coping with mental health conditions for a long time without modern medicines, and many consumers are conversant with and use these remedies. So it is important that the evidence that exists be compiled and disseminated. According to NCCAM, there are five major branches of CAM: Whole Medical Systems Whole medical systems are built upon complete systems of theory and practice. Often, these systems have evolved apart from and earlier than the conve ntional medical approach used in the United States. Examples of whole medical systems that have developed in Western cultures CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents include homeopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine . Examples of syst ems that have developed in non -Western cultures include traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda . This outline will not discuss these medical systems but will discuss biologically -based (herbal medicine) practices derived from them which have been studied and found to have an evidence base. People wishing to study or use such medical systems need to consult accomplished practitioners. The sources contain discussions of homeopathy (Mischoulon and Rosenbaum and Lake and Spiegel), Chinese medicine (Lake and Spiegel), acupuncture (Mischoulon and Rosenbaum), and Ayurveda (Lake and Spiegel). Mind -Body Medicine Mind -body medicine uses a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms . Some techniques that were considered CAM in the past have become mainstream (for example, patient support groups and cognitive -behavioral therapy). Other mind -body techniques are still considered CAM, including relaxation techniques, biofeedback, meditation /mindfulness, prayer, mental healing, yoga, martial arts, and therapies that use creative outlets such as art, music, or dance. These practices are hard to study, and truly randomized trials are impossible. This outline will discuss those treatments that have been studied and found to be promising based on the best evidence that we now have. Brown et al. and Brown et al . II and Lake and Spiegel (in an article authored by Brown and Gerbarg) discuss these therapies, as does Sco tt Shannon in his Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Mental Health.17 Biologically -Based Practices Biologically -based practices use substances found in nature, such as herbs, foods, and vitamins, as remedies. Some examples include dietar y supplements, herbal products, and the use of other natural, but as yet scientifically unproven therapies. These treatments are easily available and extensively used in America, now appearing in your neighborhood grocery. The biologically - based practices that have been found to work in alleviating mental health conditions are the focus of this outline. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Manipulative and Body -Based Practices Manipulative and body -based practices in CAM are based on manipulation or movement of one or more parts of the body. Some examples include chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation , and massage . This outline will not discuss these treatments. Energy Medicine Energy therapies (a controver sial term little used in the field) involve the use of magnetic and electrical (or electro -magnetic) fields. They are of two types: Biofield therapies are intended to affect energy fields that purportedly surround and penetrate the human body. The existenc e of such fields has not yet been scientifically proven. Some forms of energy therapy manipulate biofields by applying pressure or manipulating the body by placing the hands in, or through, these fields. Examples include qigong , Reiki , and Therapeutic Touch . This outline will not discuss these therapies. Lake and Spiegel discuss these therapies, as does Scott Shannon in his Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Therap ies in Mental Health.18 Bioelectromagnetic -based therapies involve the unconventional use of electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields, magnetic fields, or alternating -current or direct -current fields.19 This outline will discuss these therapies. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Why do People Use CAM? People use CAM for good reasons and for bad reasons, and with more or less information. Most importantly, if a person suffering from a serious mental health condition has not responded well to standard treatments or has been unable to to lerate the side effects, it makes sense to consider less well -proven treatments . According to Mischoulon and Rosenbaum, one -third of people treated with antidepressants fail to respond,20 and researchers are discovering CAM treatments that help people with such \"refractory\" depression, often as \"adjunctive treatment,\" added on to prescription meds, but sometimes as alternatives to standard psychotropic drugs. CAM treatments are more often complements than alternatives, when standard treatments do not fully relieve the symptoms or cause side effects that can be mitigated by CAM. Many - though by no means all - have minimal side effects and drug interactions. And the low cost of some CAM treatments (despite the lack of insurance reimbursement) is an additional appeal for many consumers. Our bodies have remarkable self -healing as well as self -sickening capacities. The beauty of mind -body and other CAM treatments is that they can enable us to discover ways to turn on and support those self -healing abilities. Information Needed MHA is concerned that many consumers are using CAM treatments that are not likely to help their condition, without discussing their use with their health care provider, or in situations where the clinician is unable to help because of ina dequate information, and without adequate consideration of the evidence that exists on efficacy, co -occurring conditions, drug interactions, side effects, dosages, and alternatives. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents What constitutes an adequate evidence base varies among authors, research ers, clinicians, and government regulatory agencies. Further, within each of these professions, individuals and groups use the existing evidence bases in different ways and for different purposes. Under FDA regulations, while drug companies may not adver tize off -label uses, doctors are permitted to use medications to treat conditions even if the medication has not acquired FDA approval for that particular usage, as long as there is a clear rationale documented by the doctor. For example, if a patient has failed to respond to (or cannot tolerate) standard FDA -approved treatments, there is leeway for the physician to use non -FDA approved treatments. This is a common practice because there are many useful treatments for which no company has spent the millio ns of dollars required to meet the FDA's study requirements. So in these cases, what is the evidence base? Sometimes there are studies, of ascending quality as a promising treatment is studied more, but many times there are only preliminary data and clin ical experience. An academic researcher can refuse to endorse a CAM treatment if, for example it has been shown to be beneficial in open -label studies, but not yet in randomized double -blind pl acebo - controlled studies. In contrast, the physician's goal is to get the patient/consumer as well as possible. [In accord with current custom, t his outline uses the term s \"person\" or \"consumer\" for persons with lived experien ce of mental health conditions. ] A clinician respon sible for the care of a person who has not responded or has had adverse reactions to standard treatments is justified in offering other options even if the evidence base is not yet as strong, particularly if the risks are low and the clinician knows of other cases (by anecdote or through a prel iminary study) in which they have been effective. The physician then can present the evidence for trying a CAM treatment and help the consumer weigh the risks vs. benefits. Some consumers are more conservative and require a higher level of proof, while o thers are more willing to try new options even if there is only a small chance of success so long as the risks are low. MHA hopes that this outline will help in presenting comparative analyses of the CAM treatments that have been evaluated by multiple sou rces, so that consumers can participate actively in treatment decisions. But nothing can replace the advice of a skilled practitioner. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents The clinician's job is different from the researcher's job. The researcher aims to demonstrate significant, reproducible treatment effects that can be defended as valid. The clinicians' job is to heal the consumer or relieve an adverse condition using every reasonable method without injuring the consumer, and the process requires starting with treatments with the highest likelihood of success, and, if those fail, moving on to other approaches with smaller (but not zero) chance of success without a significant risk of causing harm. Most consumers appreciate the fact that innovative clinicians take the \"no stone unturned\" a pproach because in many cases, with a little experimentation, effective CAM treatments can be found. The uncounseled consumer is in a more difficult position, without the experience of clinical practice, relying on what the studies have shown. Sometimes, the evidence is ambiguous, sometimes clearer. And often the evidence is only promising, based on research rather than anecdote, but open -label, not placebo -controlled, not randomized, with small groups and for short periods. People considering the evidence presented in this outline need to consider all of these shortcomings, but where the risk is truly not significant, a more lenient standard may be appropriate. And only the consumer can set her or his risk tolerance. Progress in genomics has shown that p olymorphisms play a significant role in how an individual will or will not respond to treatments. Ultimately, when scientific studies are repeated using genomic measures so that the polymorphisms for each subject are documented, the research probably will show that there is a significant genetic effect on outcomes that will account for the differences in response rates. Then, by selecting people with the most responsive polymorphisms, we will develop studies showing much higher response rates. This needs to be established for CAM treatments as well. What Works? FUGH -BERMAN AND COTT: Among the sources that MHA has found most helpful is the seminal 1999 article by Adriane Fugh -Berman, M.D. and Jerry Cott, Ph.D., \"Dietary Supplements and CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Natural Products as Psychotherapeutic Agents.\"21 The authors used meta -analyses to find persuasive use of: St. John's Wort ( Hypericum for anxiety and stress (which Fugh -Berman and others now caution against, in light of more recent information about liver toxicity - CAUTION ADVISED) , valerian ( for depression, folate and tryptophan to enhance the effectiveness of conventional antidepressants, and omega -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for mood stabilization. The CAM therapies for mental health conditions evaluated by Fugh -Berman and Cott but not found to be supported by the available evidence included: ginseng, passion flower, skullcap and vitamins But dealing with clinically diagnosed vitamin deficiencies should be differentiated from self - prescribed vitamin therapy, especially mega -vitamin ther apy, and the absence of evidence for all of these treatments could change with more targeted studies. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents TO THE SUPPLEMENTS VALIDATED BY FUGH -BERMA N AND COTT, THIS OUTLINE ADDS: MISCHOULON ADDITIONS chromium for atypical depression folate for depression and as a possible neuroprotectant inositol for depression and panic disorder melatonin for jet lag and sleep disorders omega -3s for depression and to enhance the effectiveness of conventional anti - depressants tryptophan and 5-HTP monotherapy for anxiety a nd depression GERBARG ADDITIONS CDP - choline for cognitive impairment/dementia rhodiola for stress, mild to moderate depression, and as a possible neuroprotectant S-Adenosyl -L-Methionine (SAM -E) as a possible neuroprotectant omega -3s for depress ion and to enhance the effectiveness of conventional anti - depressants and as a possible neuroprotectant MHA ADDITIONS 5-HTP as a modern substitute for tryptophan energy medicine , FDA-approved or FDA-grandfathered yoga and meditation , in tribute to Brown' s, Gerbarg's and Gordon's work in responding to mass disasters Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA ) and 7-keto DHEA - CAUTION ADVISED CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Following Mischoulon's recommendation, MHA cautions that consumers need to exercise extra care in considering the risks and the a lternatives before using DHEA, or any other hormone, as a CAM treatment for mental health conditions. Although Mischoulon and Rosenbaum agree that DHEA is generally well tolerated and free of major side effects, they still find the risk -benefit ratio too u ncertain in the current state of the evidence. People taking DHEA or considering it should read about the evidence and make their own decision. People considering using DHEA should also consider its modern variant, 7 -keto DHEA, which may avoid or minimize the negative hormonal side effects of DHEA. OTHER SOURCES: James Lake, M.D. and David Spiegel, M.D.'s 2007 compendium of CAM Treatments in Mental Health Care , CAM advocate Andrew Weil, M.D.'s book on Spontaneous Happiness , the Natural Standard - An Eviden ce-based Herb and Supplement Guide , The (University of CA) Berkeley Wellness Reports , The Mayo Clinic Guide to Alternative Medicine 2011, the recent (2011) Iovieno et al. compendium of \"second -tier antidepressants,\" and, for its few interventions, Consumer Reports , round out this outline. The Natural Standard always has the longest list of possible drug interactions, often with no notation about the prevalence of the interaction and many warnings of potential interactions and side effects that have not yet been observed in clinical practice. Nonetheless, this outline will report the listed possible interactions and side effects, in truncated form, giving information from the other sources as much as possible to put concerns in perspective. Consumers are advi sed to discuss any concerns with a health care practitioner. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a 2003 Final Task Force Report on its \"Consumer Health Information for Better Nutrition Initiative,\" which pro posed that more and better information be made available about dietary supplements.22 As part of the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act,23 Congress empowered the FDA to authorize health claims based CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents on \"significant scientific agreement\" that a claim i s supported by evidence including \"well - designed\" studies. However, the data examined in this outline have yet to be submitted to this process, in part because of cost considerations and in part due to the paucity of well -designed studies and the gaps note d in this outline. Thus, to some extent, this outline substitutes for the lack of an expeditious FDA process giving the public access to less -than -perfect scientific evidence and less -than -complete scientific consensus about dietary supplements that are already in wide use for mental health conditions. MHA believes that the current FDA process, while a good -faith response to First Amendment concerns about the FDA stifling free expression of ideas,24 still makes perfection the enemy of the good. New guideline s issued by the FDA in 2009 as Guidance for Industry: Evidence -Based Review System for the Scientific Evaluation of Health Claims - Final25 have given additional guidance in the determination of \"significant scientific agreement,\" and the disclaimers that are needed to allow less -than -perfect claims, but retained the restrictive criteria enunciated in the 2003 Report: whether the food or dietary supplement that is the subject of the petition is likely to have a significant impact on a serious or life -threat ening illness; the strength of the evidence; whether consumer research has been provided to show the claim is not misleading; whether the substance that is the subject of the claim has undergone an FDA safety review (i.e., is an authorized food additive, h as been Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) affirmed, listed, or has received a letter of \"no objection\" to a GRAS notification); whether the substance that is the subject of the claim has been adequately characterized so that the relevance of available st udies can be evaluated; whether the disease is defined and evaluated in accordance with generally accepted criteria established by a recognized body of qualified experts; and whether there has been prior review of the evidence or the claim by a recognized body of qualified experts. 26 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents This formulation leaves out the central First Amendment consideration, which is clarification of the disclaimer language needed to make a less -than -perfect claim not misleading, in order to get the existing information out to the public. In fact, the new Guidance goes so far as to eliminate separate review of \"qualified\" health care claims based on its conclusion that the standard is essentially the same as for any health care claim. The impact of this regulatory change remain s to be seen as new petitions are reviewed, but it assures that for now, data about CAM treatments for mental health conditions will not become widely available because the FDA review process itself will curtail availability of information from product lab els. This situation underlies the need for this outline. According to Berkeley Wellness , there have been numerous reports of dietary supplements containing much less, or much more, than what's listed on the labels. To address these concerns, the FDA issued final rules in 2007 that require dietary supplement makers to follow more extensive \"good manufacturing practices\" (GMPs) to ensure the identity, purity, strength and composition of their products. The 2007 GMPs are specific for dietary supplements and im pose higher standards on these products than food GMPs do. For example, companies are supposed to test all raw materials, set expiration dates based on documented science, ensure that workers are appropriately trained and follow proper procedures, and keep more extensive records, subject to FDA inspection. But the final rules were watered down from the original proposals. Not surprisingly, manufacturers fought against measures that would increase costs. What's more, the FDA, despite increased funding and a pledge to substantially increase inspections, still lacks the resources to fully monitor compliance, which is done primarily through inspection of paperwork, not facilities. In particular, the provision to test finished products was dropped in the final ru le. Though the GMPs for dietary supplements are supposed to ensure that products contain what their labels say, manufacturers are required only to test raw ingredients \u2014and they can still cut corners and make poor -quality products. The FDA has also been cri ticized for allowing some companies to CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents be exempt from testing all their ingredients, for not setting lead or pesticide limits in supplements, and for a range of other holes and loopholes. GMPs for dietary supplements don't guarantee safety. Ingredients can still have side effects and unknown long -term effects, interact with drugs and be dangerous if you have certain medical conditions. They have nothing to do with whether a product \"works.\" And the GMPs do not change how dietary supplements are labeled . Unlike labels on drugs, those on supplements still need not list any precautions, contraindications or possible interactions -- another reason for this outline. MHA AND CAM MHA has long advocated a recovery and wellness approach to mental health conditions. In June of 2007 the National Mental Health Association was renamed Mental Health America (MHA), reflecting an intention to develop and implement new strategies to engage the general public in a holistic approach to health, which fully embraces the central ity of mental health to overall health. The concept of wellness recognized by the 2007 changes to the MHA mission statement represents a new policy direction for MHA, which broadens the organization's role to advocacy of the health promoting measures tha t American society desperately needs to respond to the challenges of modern life and its multiple threats to our health and well -being. MHA believes that the concept of wellness is closely tied to the concept of recovery from mental health conditions, and that many of the strategies and tactics that are used to maintain good health also are useful in negotiating recovery from the disability associated with a chronic illness - including mental health and substance use conditions. These recovery and wellnes s approaches are documented in MHA's policies27 and form the core of MHA's overall effort to reframe mental health as an issue of central concern to all of CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents American society. We must never relax our vigilance in reaching out to protect the stigmatized, margi nalized people who, abandoned by lack of government funding of both institutional and community -based treatment, roam our streets and sleep under our bridges. But we must do more to help the broader group of people who want to make their lives better and n eed basic scientific information about alternatives. Thus, in 2008, MHA adopted Operation Policy O -18, committing itself to address that unmet need: a. Development of Balanced Information : It is in the interest of persons with mental health and substance use conditions that research and education be dedicated to investigating and disseminating reliable scientific information concerning behavioral health medications and other treatments, services and supports. MHA will seek to assure the availability of balanc ed information that does not overstate the advantages of any single intervention or class of interventions, nor cause MHA to be perceived as endorsing any provider or providers of treatments, services and supports. b. Dissemination of Balanced Information. Thus, among other initiatives, and consistent with its policy promoting recovery and self -directed treatment, MHA will seek to make information and data concerning alternative, complementary and integrative treatments for mental health and substance use co nditions more available. Similarly, MHA will advocate wide dissemination of clinical trial data, including data concerning side effects and data that question the safety or effectiveness of any medication or other treatment, service or support as well as research on design and delivery of exemplary treatments, services and supports across the full range of treatment options. This outline is MHA's effort to keep that promise. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents CAM FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS GLOSSARY This outline uses the general gloss ary of SAMHSA's National Registry of Eviden ce-based Programs and Practices http://nrepp.samhsa.gov/AboutGlossary.aspx ADDITIONAL GLOSSARY: Adjunctive use means use of multiple psychotropic drugs. U se of one psychotropic drug alone is called monotherapy . Psychotropic drug means any drug that significantly affects mental processes MAOI, SSRI, and Tricyclic Antidepressants , see -is-depression -diagnosed -and- treated.shtml Mood stabilizers are medications used to even out the mood swings experienced by a person with bipolar disorder. All mood stabilizers treat mania and hypomania , and some have been found to be effective in treating depression as well. See the NIMH's website on treatment of bipolar disorder: http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar -disorder/how -is-bipolar -disorder - treated.shtml The first mood stabilizer discovered was lithium , a naturally occurring substance. Other mood stabilizers currently used were originally developed to treat seizure disorders, such as epilepsy, and are thus called anticonvulsants . Acute episodes of mania result in psychosis in as many as two-thirds of those with this disorder. Thus, antipsychotics are used frequently in treating CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents bipolar symptoms. They are also often used to decrease symptoms of mania until mood stabilizers such as those listed above can take full effect. In some cases, these may be used for long -term maintenance of stability. Anti-anxiety drugs in a class called benzodiazepines are sometimes used to gain rapid control of manic symptoms so that mood stabilizers have time to take effect. The benzodiazepines are central nervous system (CNS) depressants. These medications are primarily used to produce sedation, induce sleep, relieve anxiety and muscle spasms, and prevent seizures. They may also be used to help restore a normal sleep schedule. MIND -BODY MEDICINE WELLNESS: LIVE YOUR LIFE WELL In 2009, MHA launched a website called \"Live Your Life Well,\" intended to promote mental wellness through ten straightforward steps: 1) Connect with Others . People who feel connected are happier and healthier --and may even live longer. 2) Stay Positive. People who regularly focus on the positive in their lives are less upset by painful memories. 3) Get Physically Active . Exercise can help relieve insomnia an d reduce depression. 4) Help Others . People who consistently help others experience less depression, greater calm and fewer pains. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 5) Get Enough Sleep. Not getting enough rest increases risks of weight gain, accidents, reduced memory and heart problems. 6) Create Joy and Satisfaction . Positive emotions can boost your ability to bounce back from stress. 7) Eat Well. Eating healthy food and regular meals can increase your energy, lower the risk of developing certain diseases and influence your mood. 8) Take Care of Your Spirit . People who have strong spiritual lives may be healthier and live longer. Spirituality seems to cut the stress that can contribute to disease. 9) Deal Better with Hard Times . People who can tackle problems or get support in a tough situation tend to feel less depressed. 10) Get Professional Help if You Need It . More than 80 percent of people who are treated for depression improve. These steps, and concrete suggestions for achieving mental wellness, are summarized on the MHA wellness web site, http://www.liveyourlifewell.org/go/you -can-live-life-well-more . The Evidence The concrete steps suggested by the website are not based on guesses, fads or advice from grandma (though she probably got a lot right). They represent hundreds of research studies with thousands of participants, cited on the website. This research shows that there are several evidence based approaches to help individuals handle stressful situat ions effectively and protect their wellbeing. No matter how stressful your situation, you can take steps to promote your well -being. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents We're not talking about huge changes to your lifestyle, either. We're talking about reasonable steps that if used consist ently can increase your comfort and boost your ability to build a rewarding life. About the Live Your Life Well Campaign MHA launched the Live Your Life Well campaign to provide tools to people like you who are stressed by the many demands of modern life .

Although the district court ruled for FDA (14 F. Supp. 2d 10 (D.D.C. 1998), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the lower court's decision (164 F.3d 650 (D.C. Cir.1999)).

It is a natural constituent of brain chemistry. It has been used for several years outside the United States to treat cerebrovascular disorders (those that affec t the blood in the brain) , including stroke, and has been studied for use in cognitive impairment and dementia. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS The studied mental health uses of CDP Choline are almost exclusively for neuroprotection . One source and one meta -analysis (by the Cochrane Stroke Review Group) , have found evidence that supports CDP Choline's effectiveness as a neuroprotectant . A recent well -designed Italian study confir ms its effectiveness in treating vascular dementia . The other sources do not mention it. One study looked for an effect on attention but couldn't find one. SIDE EFFECTS & DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no reported side effects or drug interactions with CDP Ch oline. The risk is minimal. CONCLUSION CDP choline ma y be effective only in treating vascular dementia, but it is a promising neuroprotectant for that purpose . CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents OUTLINE EFFICACY: NEUROPROTECTION DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS 1. is a naturally occurring intermediate involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a major constituent of the grey matter of brain tissue (30%). C DP choline consumption promotes brain metabolism by enhancing the synthesis of ace tyl- choline, restoring phospholipid content in the brain and affecting neuronal membrane excitability and concentration . CDP Choline is mainly used in the treatment of disorders of a cerebrovascular nat ure. The many years of use have caused an evolution in dosage, method of administration, an d selection criteria. 2. EFFICAC Y: NEUROPROTECTION Brown et al . state that CDP choline has been used to treat stroke, dementia, and brain injury in Europ e and Japan ,1 is well absorbed, crosses the blood - brain barrier, and breaks down into components useful for brain health. Choline is incorporated into the membrane phospholipid structure, improves mitochondrial metabolism and synthesis of phospholipids and elevates norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. Thus, it has long been thought of as a sort of \"brain tonic. \"2 A 2005 meta -analysis of controlled trials of CDP choline by the Cochrane Stroke Review Group concluded that \" there is some evidence that the CDP choline has positive effects on memory and behavior in the short to medium term in cerebral disorders in the elderly . The evidence of benefit from global impression was stronger, but is still limited by the duration of the studies.3 Fourteen studies were included in this review. Participants varied over the years and b y type of disorders and severity, and ranged from aged individuals with subjective memory disorders to patients with Vascular Cognitive Impairment (mild to moderate), CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Vascular Dementia or Senile Dementia (mild to moderate). Seven of the included studies observed the subjects for a period between 20 to 30 days, one study was of 6 weeks duration, four studies used periods extending over 2 and 3 months, one study observed continuous administration over 3 months and one study was prolonged, with 12 months of ob servation. The studies were heterogeneous in dose, modalities of administration, inclusion criteria for subjects and outcome measures. Results were reported for the domains of att ention, memory testing, behavio ral rating scales, global clinical impression and tolerability. The Cochrane Stroke Review Group further concluded that there was no evidence of a beneficial effect of CDP Choline on attention. There was evidence of benefit of CDP Choline on memory function and behavio r. A well -designed nine -month 2013 Italian study of 349 subjects validated the use of CDP Choline for treatment of mild vascular dementia.4 Alzheimer's dementia was excluded from the study. The main outc omes were an improvement in Mini -Mental State Examination, Activities of Daily Livin g, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores in the study group compared with the control group. The study group was administered oral CDP Choline 500 mg twice a day throughout the study. 3. Thus, Brown and Gerbarg recommend , \"more long -term studies , particularly for vascular cognitive impairment, vascular de mentia, and age -related memory decline.\"5 4. DRUG INTERACTIONS : Not covered by the Natural Standard . None noted by others. 5. SIDE EFFECTS: The Cochrane Stroke Review Group concluded that t he drug w as well tolerated. Brown et al. assert that CDP choline is \"quite safe and causes v irtually no side - effects.\" 1 Alvarez, X.A., Disease Patients: Effects on Cognitive Performance, Brain Cerebral Perfusion,\" Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol. 21(9):633 -44 (1999).

Rev. 5. 5 Brown et al , op. cit . CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents CHROMIUM FOR ATYPICAL DEPRESSION SUMMARY WHAT WE KNOW Although the studies are mixed, two of the three sources that mention chromium affirm its antidepressant activity in atypical depression, a condition characterized by increased appetite, hyperphagia ( excessive hunger and abnormally large intake of solids by mouth) , and carbohydrat e craving, among other clinical features. The third source judges chromium treatment to be promising. No source dissents. Leading researchers (Lake and Spiegel) posit a therapeutic effect in other kinds of depression as well, but the studies are not yet ad equate to fully credit this suggestion. The risk is minimal. DRUG INTERACTIONS Chromium use should be coordinated with the prescribing physician of any immunosuppressive drug. Since chromium may lower insulin resistance, people taking oral drugs for dia betes or using insulin should closely monitor their insulin levels while using chromium. People taking beta -blockers may experience higher HDL cholesterol levels and increases in blood pressure while using chromium. SIDE E FFECTS According to the Natura l Standard , chromium \"appears to be well tolerated with rare or uncommon adverse effects.\" CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents The most commonly reported side effects with chromium supplementation include initial insomnia, increased and vivid dreams, tremor, mild psychomotor activation, stomach discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Given the risk of \"cycling,\" caution should be used in people who have (or may develop) bipolar disorder. Chromium is safe in children, pregnancy and lactation. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents OUTLINE EFFIC ACY: ATYPICAL DEPRESSION DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS PREPARATION: CHROMIUM PICOLINATE DOS AGE RESEARCH 1. Chromium is a widely used nutritional supplement marketed for a wide range of applications. Estimated sales of chromium supplements in U.S. amounted to $85 million in 2002, representing 5.6% of the tota l mineral -supplement market. Chromium is sold as a single -ingredient supplement as well as in combination formulas, particularly those marketed for weight loss and performance enhancement. Clinical studies have focused on chromium picolinate, but chromium is sold in many forms. 2. EFFICACY : ATYPICAL DEPRESSION Recent clinical and experimental studies have reported antidepressant activity of chromium, particularly in atypical depression, characterized by increased appetite, hyperphagia ( excessive hunger and abnormally large intake of solids by mouth) , and carbohydrate craving, among other clinical features. A compound such as chromium that exerts a normalizing effect on insulin sensitivity and appe tite while having antidepressant activity may be a promising therapeutic option in people with atypical depression, a subtype of depression typically associated with overeating and weight gain. Lake and Spiegel conclude that, \"although, to date, there hav e been [few] ... controlled studies, the available data from open [label] trials and observational CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents studies are compelling.... The available evidence suggests that chromium supplementation can be used as a monotherapy [for depression and other mood disorders] o r as an adjunct therapy with conventional antidepressants.\"1 A 2011 review co -authored by Mischoulon (Iovieno, N., Dalton E. D., Fava, M. Mischoulon, D., \"Second -tier Natural Critique,\" Journal of Affective Disorders 130(3):34 3-57 (2011)) describes chromium as part of the \"next wave of natural antidepressants. \" The group reported on the evidence, focusing on the Davidson et al .'s (2003)2 placebo -controlled, double -blind pilot study in 15 subjects with atypical major depression. Ten persons received chromium picolinate (initial dose of 400 mcg per day, increased to 600 mcg per day after 2 weeks) and 5 persons received placebo for 8 weeks. Response rates were 70% for chromium vs. 0% for placebo (p=.02), and remission rates were 60 % for chromium vs. 0% for placebo (p=.04). A 50% reduction in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM -D) score was evident as early as week 2 in the patients receiving chromium. Treatment was well tolerated, although two subjects reported insomnia. The Natural Standard rates use of chromium for both depression and bipolar disorder as \"C,\" \"Unclear scientific evidence for this use.\" But the Natural Standard acknowledges that \" early studies show that [chromium picolinate] may improve symptoms of depression in people with atypical depression.\" 3. DRUG INTERACTIONS: According to the Natural Standard , chromium may change the way the body processes certain drugs and herbs using the liver's cytochrome P450 enzyme system. As a result, the level of these drugs may be increased in the blood and may cause increased effects or adverse reactions. This concern seems more theoretical than real, at least with the use that has been made of chromium in clinical practice. Brown and Gerbarg and Iovieno have not observed any su ch interactions in extensive experience with chromium picolinate. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents The Natural Standard warns that since chromium may modify serotonin function in the brain, it may interact with prescription antidepressants such as sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Pro zac). The Natural Standard makes no reference to clinical evidence, and Brown and Gerbarg have never observed such an interaction. Immunosuppressive drugs are also warned against as a potential harmful interaction by the Natural Standard , based on \"some e vidence\" that chromium, in combination with copper, may suppress the immune system. The Natural Standard urges caution to people with compromised immune systems, while acknowledging that, \"the evidence thus far has not been conclusive.\" Chromium use should be coordinated with the prescribing physician of any immunosuppressive drug. Since chromium may lower insulin -resistance, people taking oral drugs for diabetes or using insulin should monitor themselves carefully while using chromium. People taking beta -blockers may experience higher HDL cholesterol levels and increases in blood pressure while using chromium. Drugs that may decrease chromium levels include esomeprazole (Nexium/Prilosec), ranitidine (Zantac), antacids, corticosteroids, aspirin and NSAIDs. 4. SIDE EFFECTS : According to the Natural Standard , chromium \"appears to be well tolerated with rare or uncommon adverse effects .\" This position applies only to the trivalent form of chromium, as the hexavalent form appears to be toxic. The principal side effects cited by the Natural Standard are stomach discomfort, nausea and vomiting. \"Very rarely,\" skin rashes, insomnia, headache, mood changes, muscle damage, or anemia may occur. The Natural Standard says only that \"it is possible\" that chromium may lowe r blood sugar, and this concern is only relevant if the person is taking diabetes medicine. The Natural Standard details less likely side effects, including adverse effects on the heart, blood, kidneys, or liver, and cognitive, perceptual and motor effects . Iovieno et al . found chromium supplements to be well tolerated and safe. However, they reported different \"commonly reported side effects\" with chromium CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents supplementation including initial insomnia, increased and vivid dreams, tremor, and mild psychomotor activation. Lake and Spiegel refer to chromium as \"one of the least toxic nutrients,\" \"well - tolerated\" so long as bedtime dosing is avoided if insomnia becomes a problem. Vivid dreaming is reported to remit after 2 weeks. Given the risk of cycling, cautio n should be used in people who have (or may develop) bipolar disorder. Preclinical studies have shown that the addition of chromium picolinate to the diet of rats is not associated with toxicity even at doses greater than a thousand times the usual human intake.3 The Institute of Medicine reviewed the safety information on chromium in 2001 and concluded that up to 160 mcg per day of trivalent chromium picolinate (or 200 mcg per day of trivalent chromium) is safe when used consistent with published clinica l data for up to three to six months.4 The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database states that chromium is \"probably safe\" in children, pregnancy and lactation. 5. PREPARATION: TRIVALENT CHROMIUM PICOLINATE : Supplements are chromium , chromium nicotinate, polynicotinate, chromium picolinate, and chromium citrate. Trivalent chromium picolinate seems to be the best tolerated form and is easily absorbed by humans. Over the past three decades, there have been no reports of chromium toxicity in any chromium supplementation studies that used trivalent chromium picolinate. 6. DOSAGE: The Natural Standard reports that studies have used 200-1000 mcg per day , but asserts that the recommended chromium picolinate doses are lower, at 200-250 mcg per day. Lake and Spiegel cite therapeutic study dosages of from 200 -600 mcg per day in divided doses and a recommended daily intake of 50-200 mcg. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Iovieno et al. recommend doses of chromium picolinate in the range of 400 to 600 mcg per day (twice those reported by the Natural Standard ), and add that chromium should be taken in the morning because of possible interference with sleep. According to Iovieno et al ., the dose of 400 mcg was sufficient to alter brain serotonin activity in an experimental study on healthy volunteers who received chromium picolinate for seven days, and is considered the biologically active daily dose in well -nourished individuals . Chromium is often found in multi -vitamin and multi -mineral dietary supplemen ts, in doses ranging from 50 to 400 mcg per day , and some dietary supplements may include forms of chromium other than chromium picolinate. 7. RESEARCH: Long -term outcomes -- benefits and liabilities from continuing treatment with chromium and comparative a ssessment with other drugs -- require further investigation, as do the systematic tracking, reporting and quantification of adverse effects. In particular, studies should examine the efficacy of chromium in treating other forms of depression. 1 Lake, J.A. and Spiegel, D., Complementary and Alternative Treatments in Mental Health Care , American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., Washington (2007) , at 144. 2 Davidson, J.R., Abraham, K., Connor, K.M. & McLeod, M.N., Placebo Rats,\" Journal Am. Coll. Nutr .16:273 -279(1997). 4 Institute of Medicine, Food and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents DHEA AND 7 -KETO DHEA FOR DEPRESSION AND BIPOLAR DISORDER SUMMARY DHEA (5 -Dehydroepiandrosterone) is a natural steroid produced in the adrenal glands, the gonads and the brain. It is the most abundant circulating steroid in humans. A form of DHEA , 7- keto DHEA (3 -acetyl-7-oxodehydroepiandosterone), is claimed to have fewer side effects. WHAT WE KNOW DHEA is involved in a range of biological effects and may cause some problematic hormonal side effects. The newer form (7 -keto DHEA) may be safer, but research on its effectiveness and its side effects is extremely limited. DHEA supplementation may help with depression, but it has a long list of potential side effects and drug interactions. MHA cautions against use of DHEA, cautiously recommends 7 -keto DHEA as an alternati ve to DHEA pending further testing, and counsels getting the help of a skilled health care practitioner, especially if using any other drugs or herbs. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS Mood Disorders Only two of the four sources that discuss DHEA are unambiguous in supporting its use for treatment of depression. Most sources do not mention DHEA for depression. All sources advise caution because of the risks. Bipolar Disorder DHEA should be used with caution and in lower doses in people with bipolar disorder. DHEA may exacerbate mania, irritability and aggression. Leading researchers (Mischoulon and Rosenbaum) recommend that people taking DHEA should be regularly monitored for occasional development of aggressive or disinhibited behavior. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents PTSD Case reports showed pr omising possibilities for the effects of 7 -keto DHEA on PTSD; however, there are still inadequate clinical studies supporting this use. Schizophrenia Two trials of DHEA treatment in people with schizophrenia showed a reduction in negative symptoms, and exp erts theorize that there may be a deeper connection. But there isn't enough research to show that DHEA is particularly promising or effective for this use. Cognition Recent trials do not support the use of DHEA for neuroprotection. 7-KETO DHEA DHEA, 7 -keto -DHEA is not converted to steroid hormones such as androgen and estrogen . Taking 7 -keto -DHEA by mouth or applying it to the skin does not increase the level of steroid hormones in the blood . Thus, 7 -keto DHEA deserves study to determine whether it has the same efficacy as DHEA without the hormonal side effects. DRUG INTERACTIONS AND SIDE EFFECTS Drug Interactions : If you are considering taking or continuing to take DHE A or 7 -keto DHEA, you should definitely consult with a skilled health care practitioner. It is critical to consult with your prescribing physician if you are taking any psychotropic medication. DHEA may interfere with a wide variety of prescription medica tions, over -the-counter medications, and other herbal supplements. DHEA may also interact with a recent flu vaccination or with alcohol consumption. As a result, great care should be taken before supplementing DHEA levels. No prescription medication should be taken with DHEA without consulting with the prescribing physician. The following list is illustrative only. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Interactions include potential interference with: Other steroids; Psychotropic drugs such as clozapine (Clorazil); Medications and herbs that a ffect blood sugar levels; Anticoagulant or anti -platelet drugs (those that thin the blood), such as warfarin Coumadin), hepadrin or clopidogrel, or herbs with similar effects, such as ginseng; Hormone replacement therapy and birth control pills, as well as herbs that have hormonal effects, such as alfalfa and blood root; Heart medications or herbs that alter heart rhythms; Any medication that may increase DHEA levels in the body, including growth hormones and aprazolem (Xanax), antipsychotics, and pain kill ers, as well as supplements like chromium. Studies have not yet been conducted to determine whether the same interactions exist with 7 - keto DHEA. Side Effects May increase the risk of developing prostate, breast, ovarian, uterine, or cervical cancer and ma lignant melanoma or other hormonally -affected cancers. Hormonal side effects can be significant, including acne, skin changes, excess hair or hair loss, increased sweating, and weight gain. Men may develop more prominent breasts, breast tenderness, increa sed blood pressure, testicular wasting, and significant elevations in testosterone levels with potential effects on the prostate and increased aggressiveness. In women, the most common side effects are abnormal menses, emotional changes, headache, and ins omnia. Additional hormonal side effects may include increases in blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, altered cholesterol levels, altered thyroid hormone levels, and altered adrenal function. . CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Can lead to insomnia. May affect blood sugar levels. People with severe diabetes should not use DHEA; others should monitor blood sugar levels carefully. May increase the risk of bleeding or blood clotting. May alter heart rate or rhythms. May cause fatigue, nasal congestion, headache, acne, and rapid and irregula r heartbeat. May cause agitation, delusions, nervousness, irritability, or psychosis and may induce hypomanic, aggressive, psychotic, or disinhibited behavior. In people with bipolar disorder, DHEA should be used with caution and only in low doses because it can exacerbate mania, irritability, and aggression. People with a history of abnormal heart rhythms, blood clots or problems with clotting, or a history of liver disease, serious diabetes or hyperglycemia, high cholesterol, thyroid disorders, or other serious endocrine (hormonal) abnormalities should avoid DHEA Children should not use DHEA, nor should it be used during pregnancy or breast feeding. While 7 -keto DHEA may not cause the same hormonal side effects, there isn't enough research to prove its ef ficacy or side effects. CONCLUSION Each consumer needs to make a risk -versus -reward decision about DHEA. MHA urges caution because the evidence of efficacy is weak and the potential side effects and drug interactions are significant. More study is needed before 7 -keto DHEA can be recommended as an alternative, but it may be prudent to consider it prior to studies substantiating the claims being made, in order to reduce risk. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents OUTLINE EFFICACY: DEPRESSION AND BIPOLAR DISO RDER SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: COGNITION CAUTION DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS HORMONAL SIDE EFFECTS CHECKLIST DOSAGE RESEARCH 1. 5-Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA ) is a 19 -carbon endogenous natural steroid hormone . It is the major secretory steroid al product of the adrenal glands and is also produced by the gonads and the brain. DHEA is the most abundant cir culating steroid in humans. 2. DHEA has been implicated in a broad range of biological effects in humans and other mammals. It acts on the androgen receptor both directly and through its metabolites , which include androstenediol and androstenedione , which can undergo further conversion to produce the testosterone and the estrogens estrone and also a agonist. It is considered a neurosteroid . 3. DHEA levels in the blood correlate with mood, memory and functional abilities, but causation cannot be inferred. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 4. 7-keto DHEA (3 -acetyl -7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone) is marketed as a form of DHEA that presents less risk of side effects. While 7 -keto DHEA does not incre ase the level of steroid hormones in the blood , no clinical studies to demonstrate either its efficacy or its safety have yet been completed. PubMed reports only three published studies of 3-acetyl -7-oxo- dehydroepiandrosterone, of which only one deals with a mental health use. 5. EFFICACY: DEPRESSION AND BIPOLAR DISORDER: Brown et al . refer to DHEA and 7 -keto DHEA as promising CAM therapies for relief of depression and bipolar disorder. Despi te the potential for hormonal effects, Brown et al. state that DHEA is \"generally well tolerated.\" 7 -keto DHEA is being used as an alternative to reduce the risk o f side effects, but there is only one randomized study of its efficacy or safety. Brown et al. cite three studies and give a clinical anecdote to support the use of DHEA for depression and bipolar disorder.1 They cite evidence for the use of DHEA in bipolar disorder but caution that: \" DHEA should be used with caution and only in low doses in bipo lar patients because it can exacerbate mania, irritability, and aggression .\" Until it is proven safe, this caution applies to 7 -keto DHEA as well. Brown et al. conclude that: \"Although the evidence for 7 -keto DHEA treatment is preliminary, considering the severity of these conditions and low risk of side effects, it is worthwhile to obtain DHEA and DHEA sulfate levels in patients with bipolar disorder ... or mid - to late -life depression. While laboratory reports indicate a normal range of 20 to 200 mg/dl, if the DHEA sulfate is below 200, it may still be worth a trial of 7 -keto DHEA using 25 to 50 mg per day. If symptoms persist, the dose may be gradually raised up to 200 mg per day.\"2 Mischoulon and Rosenbaum explore all of the trials of DHEA since 1952, foc using on depression, schizophrenia and dementia, showing the trials to be too short, too small and too poorly controlled to serve as an evidence base for clinical use of DHEA. Dosage and the means of administration proved also to be controversial. DHEA and DHEA -S (for sulfate) levels in the blood often correlate with mood, memory and functional abilities, CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents but the studies are inconsistent, and causation cannot be inferred. A chart of the 17 most prominent hypotheses serves to illustrate the disagreement.3 Results from the criticized trials were mixed, and some cast doubt on the efficacy of DHEA. A \"well -controlled\" 2006 trial examined the effects of DHEA on well -being and found no discernible effect over placebo in women or in men over a two -year trial period.4 Nonetheless, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum summarize that \"beneficial effects on mood are consistently reported\" in people with depression using DHEA. On balance, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum conclude that: \"...DHEA administration CANNOT BE RECOMMENDED for clin ical use at this time....[T]he full risk -benefit ratio, especially with high -dose treatment or with treatment for extended periods of time, remains uncertain.\"5 The Natural Standard states there is \"sufficient evidence\" supporting use of DHEA, but only for depression, ranking the evidence as \"B,\" \"good scientific evidence for this use,\" and adding that the \"majority\" of clinical studies support this use. DISSENT: The Mayo Clinic takes a strong position against use of DHEA, giving it a red rating, but its d iscussion is less absolute : \"Studies suggest that DHEA may be effective in treating mild depression....[but ] long -term use and high levels may cause serious side effects.\" \"DHEA may be useful in treating depression ..., but strictly under the guidance of a spe cialist.\" DHEA is not recommended for children or during pregnancy or breast -feeding. 6. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: PTSD: The five case reports by Brown and Sageman are the only published reports concerning use of 7 -keto DHEA for PTSD, but the results are very promising.6 Clinical studies on 7 -keto DHEA are rare, and a follow -up study is needed to substantiate the work of Sageman and Brown. 7. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: SCHIZOPHRENIA: Brown et al . suggest that DHEA levels correlate with higher psychopathology, DHEA supplementation could CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents improve symptoms of schizophrenia.7 Brown et al. cite one six -week trial of DHEA with 30 patients with schizophrenia which resulted in significant reductions in negative symptoms. They also cite a larger 12 -week study of 40 patients that found that DHEA of up to 150 mg per day reduced negative symptoms. From this, they suggest that: \"The effects of DHEA in reducing negative symptoms and medication side effects may be due to several mechanisms. DHEA frontal dopamine release, and enhances sigma - receptor activity.\"8 8. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: COGNITION: Although DHEA improves memory and brain activation in EEG studies , a three month study of normal older men found no change in cognition or well -being.9 Recent studies have not supported the use of DHEA for neuroprotection. 9. CAUTION : Because of its substantial side -effects and the significant constraints of past studies, DHEA use requires CAUTION until more is known about its effectiveness and about the potential that 7 -keto DHEA may be equally effective while reducing or el iminating hormonal side effects. 10. DRUG INTERACTIONS: DHEA may increase blood sugar levels and thus affect people with diabetes. This means that people with severe diabetes should not consider DHEA supplementation. Medication adjustments may be necessary, since many medicines affect blood sugar levels. The same is true of herbs. Thus, doses of arginine, cocoa, ephedra or melatonin (which raise sugar levels) should be adjusted when taking DHEA. Serum glucose levels should be monitored while using DHEA. DHEA may increase the risk of bleeding or blood clotting. Thus, persons who take anticoagulants or anti -platelet drugs to prevent blood clots should discuss the use of DHEA with a healthcare professional. These drugs include warfarin (Coumadin), heparin, CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents and clopidogrel (Plavix). Similarly, coenzyme Q10 or ginseng may increase the risk of clotting when used w ith DHEA According to the Natural Standard , hormone replacement therapy and birth control pills \"should not be combined with DHEA unless under medical supervision.\" For the same reason, people taking herbs that have hormonal effects such as alfalfa, black cohosh and blood root should be careful about potential additive effects. DHEA may alter heart rate or rhythms and should be used cautiously with heart medications or drugs that may also affect heart rhythms. For the same reason, caution is advised in the use of herbs that may alter heart rhythms, including adonis, balloon cotton, and foxglove (digitalis). Alcohol may increase these effects of DHEA. There are some reports that drugs such as canrenoate, anastrozole (Arimidex), growth hormones, methyephenidal e, amlodipine, blockers diltiazem (Cardizem) and aprazolem (Xanax) may increase DHEA levels within the body, which could lead to increased side effects when combined with DHEA supplements. Chromium may have the same effect. DHEA may interact with psychotropic drugs such as clozapine (Clozaril). Other psychotropic drugs are not mentioned, but DHEA use should be discussed with the prescribing physician. DHEA may interact with GABA -receptor drugs used for seizures or pain. DHEA may increase the effectiveness of methadone. DHEA may add to the effects of clofibrate or contribute to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. DHEA use may result in decreased rate of development of antibodies after influenza vaccination. Drugs that reduce normal levels of DHEA produced by the body include dopamine, insulin, corticosteroids, drugs used to treat endometriosis such as danazol, opiate painkillers, antipsychotics, and drugs containing estrogen. Many other interactions are possibl e. Since no source including the Natural Standard discusses 7 -keto DHEA, there is no scientific assessment of any differential drug interaction. This requires more study. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 11. SIDE EFFECTS : HORMONAL SIDE EFFECTS of DHEA can be significant. Examples of hormona l side effects include acne, greasy skin, hirsutism (excess body hair), facial hair, hair loss, increased sweating, weight gain around the waist, or a deeper voice in women. Men may develop more prominent breasts, breast tenderness, increased blood pressur e, testicular wasting, or increased aggressiveness. Increases in blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, altered cholesterol levels, altered thyroid hormone levels, and altered adrenal function are additional hormonal side effects. According to Brown et al ., additional side effects include significant elevations in testosterone levels with potential effects on the prostate, elevation of estrogen with increased risk of uterine or breast cancer, vaginal bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, or venous thrombosis, plus insomnia, irritability, \"slight\" increases in estrogen, and potential interactions with steroids. Cancer is a contraindication. In theory, DHEA may increase the risk of developing prostate, breast, ovarian, uterine, or cervical cancer and malignant m elanoma or other hormonally -affected cancers . DHEA may contribute to tamoxifen resistance in the treatment of breast cancer. Other side effects may include insomnia, agitation, delusions, mania, nervousness, irritability, or psychosis. The Natural Standard does not quantify the risk of these additional hormonal side effects, but all of these side effects should be qualified by statements from all sources that DHEA is generally well tolerated when taken by mouth in prescribed dosages. Brown et al. add, sign ificantly: \" In contrast, 7 -keto DHEA does not convert to testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone and is not associated with these side effects.\"10 According to WebMD, \" 7-keto -DHEA is a by o f DHEA. But unlike DHEA, 7 -keto -DHEA is not converted to steroid hormones such as androgen and estrogen . Taking 7 -keto -DHEA by mouth or applying it to the skin does not increase the level of steroid hormones in the blood .\"11 Thus, 7 -keto DHEA deserves study to CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents determine whet her it has the same efficacy as DHEA without the hormonal side effects. Since 7 -keto DHEA has not been tested in pregnancy and lactation, all DHEA drugs are inappropriate at this time. According to the Natural Standard , few side effects are reported when D HEA (or, by extension, 7 -keto DHEA) supplements are taken by mouth in recommended doses. Side effects may include fatigue, nasal congestion, headache, acne, and rapid and irregular heartbeat. In women, the most common side effects are abnormal menses, emot ional changes, headache, and insomnia. The Natural Standard cautions that people with a history of abnormal heart rhythms, blood clots or problems with clotting, or a history of liver disease, serious diabetes or hyperglycemia, high cholesterol, thyroid d isorders, or other serious endocrine (hormonal) abnormalities should avoid DHEA supplements. At a minimum, serum glucose, cholesterol and thyroid levels may need to be monitored, and medication adjustments may be necessary. This caution applies equally to 7-keto DHEA and to DHEA. Brown et al . caution that DHEA should be used with caution and only in low doses in people with bipolar disorder because it can exacerbate mania, irritability, and aggression . Mischoulon and Rosenbaum suggest that all people taking DHEA should be monitored for occasional development of hypomanic, aggressive, psychotic, or disinhibited behavior. 12. CHECKLIST : Mischoulon and Rosenbaum advise the following checklist of concerns: The consumer needs to know the state of knowledge about th e effects and potential side effects of DHEA, with particular emphasis on diminishing any unrealistic expectations about its \"antiaging\" effects, and the preliminary nature of most of the positive results reported, persons at increased risk for hormonally sensitive tumors (e.g., cancer of the breast, ovary, uterus, cervix, or prostate, or malignant melanoma) should not take DHEA and anyone concerned about cancer risk should be monitored if they do, CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents DHEA levels should be checked through blood tests and dosag e adjusted to maintain the high -normal range for healthy adults. periodic assays of serum testosterone and estradiol levels should be performed and DHEA dosage adjusted to preclude excessive increases in either hormone, and treatment should be discontinue d if no benefit is observed after approximately three months. Of all the sources consulted, only Brown et al. discuss 7 -keto DHEA and the possibility that it could limit the hormonal side effects of DHEA. 13. DOSAGE : Brown et al. conclude, from their clinic al experience: \" In most patients, energy improves on 25 to 50 mg per day. For the treatment of depression, 75 to 100 mg per day and occasionally higher doses may be needed.\" According to Mischoulon and Rosenbaum, doses have generally been in the range of 25 to 100 mg per day , or higher, with clinical trials using doses as low as 5 mg a day up to as high as 7 g per day and very little dosage comparison in the literature. Existing research supports an average dose of 50 mg in order to maintain the high -normal range for healthy adults. The Natural Standard states that commonly used doses range from 25 to 200 mg per day . Generally, these doses are divided into two or three doses, with the larger dose given in the morning to mimic the circadian rhythm. Doses late in the evening (after six to eight p.m., depending on bed time) may cause insomnia. Topical (on the skin) application and intravenous (into the veins) injections have also been studied, but safety and effectiveness have not been proven. 14. RESEARCH: There i s widespread concern about long -term use of DHEA absent better evidence of safety and effectiveness. Research needs to consider long -term as well as short - term effects and needs to catch up with consumer use. There is a particularly great need for study of 7-keto DHEA.

No serious side effects have been reported. The FDA has recognized CES as a Class III device for treatment of: depressi on, anxiety, and sleep disorders. A proceeding is pending for Class II status, focused on its use in people recovering from substance use conditions. Studies and clinical experience also suggest benefits for: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (A DHD), obsessive -compulsive disorder, post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cognitive dysfunction, traumatic brain injury, pain, enhancing attention and concentration, and CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents decreasing assaultive behavior. PRESCRIPTION REQUIRED Although a prescription is required, CES can be used safely and conveniently in the home, without professional supervision. It can be used adjunctively with most other treatments. SIDE EFFECTS Experts (Brown et al II) caution against the use of CES in pregnancy. Lactation seems not to be an issue. Differential effects on children remain to be tested. Persons with bipolar disorder need to be cautious , since use of CES could worsen the condition, as can also occur with other antidepressants. At a minimum, a mood stabilizer should be considered. The lack of drug interactions, low incidence of side effects and suggestive findings in small studies require additional research attention and counsel responsible consumer use as the data are being developed. RESEARCH NEEDED MHA encourages additional research to determine whether the promise of CES can be fulfilled, without the serious side effects of large -current ECT, Transcranial Electrostimulation (\"TES\") or deep brain stimulation (higher -intensity forms of brain stimulation, not discus sed in this outline). Future studies should target an understanding of the mechanisms or neurophysiology of both DC and AC methods of neuromodulation, as well as results for a broad range of mental health conditions, particularly depression, since most pas t studies of depression have been small and generally not double -blind. Efficacy with bipolar disorder has not been studied at all, although the anecdotal evidence is positive. A large number of suggested uses remain to be explored. CONCLUSION Promising, but not yet proven. But given minimal side effects, experimentation with CES is a reasonable choice if other treatments prove ineffective or are poorly tolerated.

Aldini1 had experimented with galvanic head current as early as 1794 (upon hims elf) and reported the successful treatment of patients suffering from melancholia using direct low - intensity currents in 1804. 2. FDA approval of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in 2008 (see below) led to interest in other forms of non -invasive brain stimu lation. This includes, in particular, contrasting the demonstrated polarizing effect of DC stimulation on brain tissue, which has long -term, site - specific effects on the activity of the cortical nervous system, with the mechanism of AC stimulation, which, while it can be shown to induce changes in central nervous system activation, indexed by changes in EEG, neurotransmitter release, and cortical excitability, cannot be explained by polarization. 3. At least eleven competing CES devices are on the market, of which four are pictured above. The fifth picture is of a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation device, which will be compared to CES. According to Brown and Gerbarg, the most extensively studied CES devices are the Alpha -Stim and the LISS Cranial Stimulator ( now marketed by Fisher Wallace as the Fisher Wallace Stimulator). The photo gallery depicts the two listed brands, plus the Oasis Pro and CESta, from internet sources. MHA makes no rep resentation about brand quality. 4. Of the consulted sources, only Brown et al. and Brown et al. II (the latter through Kirsch, D.L. and Nichols, F., who are both associated with the manufacturer of the Alpha -Stim device) discuss the use of Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (\"CES\"), a.k.a. Cranial Electrical Stimulation or Crani al Electrostimulation, the alternating current version of this over fifty - year -old therapy, grandfathered by the FDA as a Class III device for treatment of depression, anxiety and sleep disorders.2 An FDA proceeding is pending for Class II status, focused on its use in people recovering from substance use conditions. At least six competing devi ces are on the market, of which five are pictured above. 5. In January of 2016, the FDA proposed reclassifying CES devices as Class II devices for insomnia and/or anxiet y3, but with restrictive special conditions: CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Identified risk Mitigation measures Ineffective treatment Clinical Performance Testing.

Headaches Clinical performance testing. Labeling. Dizziness Clinical performance testing. Labeling. Electrical shocks and burns Electrical safety and EMC testing. Software verification, validation, and hazard ana lysis. 6. Brown et al. mention that CES: \"uses a weak electrical current, given to the ears or scalp. CES is reported to reduce anxiety during withdrawal from drugs, but most clinicians are likely to have difficulty referring to therapists experienced in th is technique, and treatments are not reimbursable by [most] insurance.\"4 Through electrodes placed on the earlobes, the maxilla - occipital junction, mastoid processes or temples, a current of up to four milliamps is passed through the cranium, treating anx iety, depression and insomnia with minimal risk. 7. The FDA proposes that CES remain a Class III device for depression and other uses. 8. The general and psychotropic mechanisms are unknown. According to Mischoulon, CES may affect endorphins, neurotransmitter s and neuro -hormones; regulation of body energy flow; the limbic system, reticular activating system, and hypothalamus; the vascular system, brain neural ring patterns and default network connectivity; circadian regulation; and the adaptogenic function (as sisting the body to battle effects of chronic stress): \"All these CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents putative mechanisms may be relevant to CES's psychotropic effects, with the adaptogenic mechanism appearing to be the most favored, as it is the sum total of all the other mechanisms mention ed, and considering the role of stress in psychiatric illness (Feusner et al., 2012; Gunther and Phillips, 2010; Kavirajan et al., 2014; Smith, 2008).\"5 9. The most common theory is that the pulses of electric current increase the ability of neural cells to produce serotonin, dopamine, DHEA, endorphins and other neurotransmitters stabilizing the neuro -hormonal system. Brown notes that increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of serotonin (e.g., CSF increase of 200%) and Beta -endorphins (CSF increase by 219%) after 20 minutes have been reported, as well as plasma level increases of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) (crucial for anxiety relief), DHEA (an important anti -stress hormone), dopamine, and others.4 10. The direct current [known as tDCS, for transcr anial Direct Current Stimulation] versions such as the \"BrainStimulator\" pictured fourth in the photo gallery, are of comparable size but are less well -studied than CES. A recent review concluded that: \"Active tDCS was statistically superior to sham tDCS i n the treatment of MDD [depression], with a medium, significant effect size in both continuous (depression score change) and categorical (response and remission) outcomes. TDCS was also an acceptable intervention, with similar dropout rates in the active v s. sham groups. However, given the mixed results of previous trials and meta - analyses and the relatively small number of trials, there is not enough evidence to perform immediate treatment suggestion of tDCS in daily clinical practice.\"6 Comparative trials with CES as well as further investigation of tDCS are both warranted. 11. Although a prescription is required, CES can be used safely and conveniently in the home, without professional supervision. It can be used adjunc tively with any other treatment. 12. EFFIC ACY: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND SLEEP DISORDERS CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents The FDA has grandfathered CES for treatment of depression, anxiety and sleep disorders Brown and Gerbarg cited two early studies of CES that found increased attention and concentration in normal adults.7 They ad d that in clinical practice, they have found that CES can improve attention, reduce anxiety, and relieve insomnia, all helpful in treating ADHD .8 A 2010 survey of the research on brain -stimulation devices by Edelmuth, Nitsche, Battistella & Fregni found 16 well -controlled clinical studies of CES, with significant outcomes reported in 65% of the trials. All of the 16were controlled trials, and the majority was double -blinded. Although the majority of trials were for depression, anxiety disorders, or insomni a (the FDA approved indications), some were for other conditions, such as recovery from substance use disorders, traumatic brain injury, pain, and enhancing attention and concentration.9 See Suggested But Unproven Uses, below. Three 2006 meta -analyses by S mith demonstrated significant improvement in anxiety, depression and insomnia from the use of CES.10 It should be noted , however , that the Smith monograph has not been peer -reviewed and that Dr. Smith is a consultant to the industry. Most studies cited as evidence for the effectiveness of CES failed to report all data necessary for meta -analysis . And while anxiety effects are well documented by the studies analyzed by Smith, most depression studies have been small and not double - blind .11 The Smith meta -analy ses were summarized as follows by Mischoulon:12 Each meta - analysis focuses on a particular treatment indication, as follows: Insomnia: 18 studies, 648 subjects, mean improvement 62% Depression: 18 studies, 853 subjects, mean improvement 47% Anxiety: 38 stud ies, 1495 subjects, mean improvement 58% Most of these studies are limited by small samples, heterogeneity of symptoms, and overlap of conditions, which limits their rigorousness and generalizability to specific conditions, though these results may be mor e reflective of \"real world\" populations in which co -morbidity tends to be the rule rather than the exception. CES appears to be a benign intervention with no serious adverse events. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents In 2012, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration concluded:13 a. \"Depression . In our literature search, we identified 12 papers that examined the effect of CES on measures of depression (6 RCTs and 6 observational studies). In most RCTs, depression levels did not differ significantly between patients who were treated with active CES c ompared to those treated with placebo. However, one randomized trial by Hearst et al. reported fewer depression symptoms in the active CES treatment versus placebo groups. Of the six observational studies that were reviewed, four studies reported improveme nt in depression symptoms after treatment with CES. Moore et al. also reported improvement in depression post - (versus pre -) CES treatment, but the findings were not statistically significant. The observational study by Marshall et al. reported no differen ce in depressive symptoms between the CES and placebo arms. b. \"Anxiety . There were 24 studies that investigated the impact of CES on anxiety (11 RCTs, 11 observational studies, 1 meta -analysis, and 1 systematic review). Of the RCTs that were evaluated, some trials reported a statistically significant benefit of CES treatment versus placebo in reducing anxiety symptoms, while other studies demonstrated no difference in anxiety between the groups. Feighner et al. also conducted an RCT and reported a reduction in anxiety at 15 days post CES, but this effect was no longer significant at 26 days. The majority of observational studies reported a positive association between CES treatment and reduction in anxiety symptoms. In the single -arm observational study by Bystritsky et al., improvements were reported for some but not all measures of anxiety. Only 2 observational studies reported that CES did not have a significant impact on anxiety based on clinical assessment and standard inventories. A meta - analysis of 8 RC Ts evaluating the efficacy of cranial stimulation on anxiety indicated that CES versus sham treatment was associated with significantly improved anxiety. Similar findings were reported in a systematic review that examined 34 controlled trials involving a t otal of 767 patients receiving CES and CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents an additional 867 patients serving as controls. 26 of 34 studies (77%) reported decreased anxiety after treatment with CES and the remaining 8 of 34 studies (24%) reported no such benefit. c. \"Insomnia . We identified 18 studies that evaluated the effectiveness of CES on insomnia. Of the 9 RCTs, some reported statistically significant reductions in insomnia symptoms in the CES group compared to placebo, while others reported no significant differences between the 2 groups . A study by Heffernan et al. also reported significant changes between the active CES treatment and placebo groups. Among the 8 observational studies, CES treatment was associated with less frequent and less intense sleep disturbances, less difficulty fal ling asleep and feeling more rested in the morning. Two observational studies reported no impact of CES on insomnia. In a study by Moore et al., subjective measures of insomnia were markedly improved during the first week of CES treatment but were no longe r significant at 2 weeks. A study by Nagata et al reported a significant reduction in sleep latency in insomniacs but not in those without sleep disorders. Lastly, a meta -analysis with pooled results from 2 RCTs examining the efficacy of CES for insomnia i ndicated no difference between the active CES and sham groups. d. \"Overall Literature Review Conclusions : Of the 39 papers included in this literature review, some reported a beneficial effect of CES treatment on depression, anxiety and insomnia while others demonstrated no effect. Among studies that reported a clinical benefit of CES, few can be considered rigorous, high quality clinical studies. FDA believes that there are basic elements that should be present in any study seeking to evaluate the effectiven ess of CES, including, but not limited to: randomized with a sham control group, eligibility criteria based on a specific diagnosis, a clinically relevant measure of effectiveness, [endnote: The FDA accepts only the Hamilton depression rating scale or the Montgomery -Asberg depression rating scale as measures of CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents depression] adequately powered sample size, predefined success criteria, and consideration for durability of effect. None of the studies identified in the literature review met all of these criteria. Regardless of the main findings, many of these studies had key limitations in study design that likely obscure the true effectiveness of CES. e. \"For example, only 12.8% (5 of 39) of the studies reported using the DSM criteria to diagnose depression, anxiet y or insomnia. Without the use of established and clinically accepted diagnostic criteria, it is unclear what psychiatric condition, if any, CES was attempting to treat in the remaining 87.2% of studies... Other important study limitations that have been pre viously mentioned include: small sample size, placebo effect (due to either no masking or unsuccessful masking) and inadequate statistical methods. A reasonable assurance of effectiveness is defined in 21 CFR 860.7(e)(1) as clinically significant results i n a significant portion of the target population, when used for these indications for use and conditions of use when accompanied by adequate directions for use and warnings against unsafe use. FDA believes the available valid scientific evidence does not demonstrate that CES will provide a reasonable assurance of effectiveness for the indication of \"insomnia, depression, or anxiety.\" f. 2012 FDA Panel Decision Regarding whether the probable benefits to health from use of CES for the indications for treatment o f insomnia, depression, or anxiety and the conditions of use outweigh the probable risks, the majority of FDA Neurological Devices Panel concluded on February 10, 2012 that \"current evidence does not clearly establish probable benefits to health from use o f CES for these indications (treatment of insomnia, depression, and anxiety) and conditions of use that would outweigh the probable risks. Some panel members expressed reservations about the panel's overall response to this question based on a lack of safe ty concerns.\"14 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 2014 Barclay and Barclay vs. 2015 Mischoulon Studies of Depression . More recent double - blind research on the use of CES in depression has yielded inconsistent results. Barclay and Barclay15 used the Alpha -stim CES device at unspecified dosage s of less than 1 mA at 0.5 Hz and measured baseline and outcome measures at weeks one, three, and five. Response to treatment was defined as a reduction of 50% or more on the two Hamilton Depression Rating Scale measures. Analysis of covariance revealed a significant difference between the active CES group and the sham CES group on anxiety (p=0.001, d=0.94) and on depression (p=0.001, d=0.78) from baseline to endpoint of study in favor of the active CES group. Mischoulon et al.16 conducted a shorter and sma ller three -week study of subjects with treatment -resistant major depressive disorder, using the Fisher -Wallace CES device. Devices were calibrated such that the power knob was to be turned up all the way for the required dose, and subjects were explicitly told to set the wheel to the maximum level. The controller (or subject, in the case of a home session) slowly turned up the CES current until the knob was at the maximum setting. The device's electronic waveform contains a 15,000 Hz square wave carrier whi ch is rectied, varying from 0 to 4 mA. The rst 15 Hz modulating signal (to theoretically influence brain neurochemical activity) provides 50 ms of \"on\" time and 16.7 ms of \"off\" time (total pulse period 66.7 ms, 50% duty cycle). A second, 500 Hz modulati ng signal changes the \"on\" time series of 15,000 Hz carrier pulses (750 pulses in 50 ms) into 25 smaller bursts of 15 pulses each of the 15,000 Hz carrier signal, for 375 pulses in the same 50 ms. The consecutive positive burst and \"off\" time is followed b y an equal and opposite negative burst and \"off\" time, b alancing the direct current component to zero. Output voltage ranges from 0 to 40 V, rst positive and then negative. CES was left at this level until it automatically shut off after 20 min. Based on the current strength, subjects receiving active or sham treatment were not expected to feel any current and were told that they should feel nothing. The primary outcome measure of the Mischoulon et al. study was improvement in the 17 - item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM -D-17). Both treatment groups demons trated improvement of about 3e5 points in HAM -D-17 scores (p < 0.05 for both), and no significant CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents differences were observed between groups. Remission rates were 12% for CES, and 15% for sham, a nonsignificant difference. Limitations include a small sample and lack of an active comparator therapy. Although both treatment groups improved significantly, this CES at the setting chosen did not separate from sham in this sample. Thus, the study could not rule out that the benefit from this setting used in this pa rticular form of CES was due to placebo effects. Since this form of CES has other settings, Mischoulon et al. recommended that future studies test these other settings and compare the Fisher -Wallace against other CES devices. 2014 Cochrane Review of Depres sion . An inconclusive review17 concluded that: \"There are insufficient methodologically rigorous studies of CES in treatment of acute depression. There is a need for double -blind randomized controlled trials of CES in the treatme nt of acute depression.\" The seven existing double -blind studies of the use of CES to treat depression were disregarded because the authors did not use standardized rating scales to measure depression and included some subjects with chronic rather than acu te depression, and the sham treatment did not include low -current electrical stimulation adequate to simulate the \"tingling\" sometimes experienced with CES. In a personal communication, Mischoulon suggested that the authors might have \"set the bar too hig h\" with regard to conducting a full analysis of the 270 studies, and that the review might have been more informative had they attempted to analyze the seven studies to some degree, so as to give the readership and interested clinicians at least some sense of how to determine whether CES would be an appropriate choice for certain patients. Mischoulon also added that since CES uses a low current, it might be difficult to design and implement a sham intervention that would produce non -therapeutic tingling, t hat most patients experience no tingling during CES treatment and that patients that he has observed who experience tingling do not report different clinical effects, such as a greater improvement, compared to patients who don't experience tingling. The C ochrane review itself proposed to drop the tingling requirement in future reviews and meta -analyses: \"Thus, in future updates, we will continue to specify that included trials use CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents sham CES as a comparator arm, but without the requirement that a local tingl ing sensation be produced by sham CES.\"18 2015 Bipolar Study . A 2015 study at Beth Israel Hospital in New York showed the Fisher - Wallace CES device to be effective in bipolar depression with minimal side effects. This \"pilot study\" had only 16 participants , but showed a 32% reduction in the HAM -D score for the CES group vs. an 18% reduction in the control group: Active CES treatment but not sham treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores from baseline to the second week (p = 0.003) maintaining significance until week 4 (p = 0.002). Results also showed \"a significant decrease in clinician -rated illness severity scores of the active group relative to the sham group (Amr et al., 2013 ). In addition, quality -of-life scores also improved significantly in the active group but not in the sham group which may be associated with the decrease in depression symptoms and an improvement in functioning. Finally, on a trend level, CES treatment was associated with impro vement in cognitive functioning and a decrease in the self -report of bodily pain in the active group only. ...there were no significant changes in the hypomania/mania scores from baseline to the end of the treatment phase or the end of the follow -up in any g roup. Thus, there was no evidence of CES inducing a switch from depression to hypomania/mania.\"19 13. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: SUBSTANCE ABUSE, ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER (ADHD), OBSESSIVE -COMPULSIVE DISORDER, PTSD, COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION, TRAU MATIC BRAIN INJURY, PAIN, ENHANCING ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION, AND DECREASING ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR A 2009 open -label study at Phoenix House,20 the nation's largest non -profit drug rehabilitation center, found that CES was well accepted by both clients and treatment staff, and that it could be easily integrated into the treatment regimen. Staff and clients viewed it as an alternative therapy that was similar to meditation but with the addition of small electrical stimulation, and the CES sessions were actua lly called the CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents \"meditation group\" by clients and staff alike. This meditation group was integrated into a daily schedule along with psychoeducation, cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT), and other therapeutic groups. Two additional 2006 meta -analyses by S mith demonstrated significant improvement in drug abstinence and cognitive dysfunction from the use of CES.21 Fibromyalgia, stress and pain management have also been tested, with promising results.22 N.b. however that the Smith monograph has not been peer -reviewed and that Dr. Smith is a consultant to the industry. The Smith meta -analyses were summarized as follows by Mischoulon:23 Each meta - analysis focuses on a particular treatment indication, as follows: Drug abstinence: 15 studies, 535 subjects, mean imp rovement 60% Cognitive dysfunction: 13 studies, 648 subjects, mean improvement 44% A 2002 bibliography by Kirsch listed 126 scientific studies of CES involving human subjects and 29 animal studies. An estimated 145 human studies have been completed, encom passing over 8800 people receiving active CES, but more rigorous controls are needed. Future studies should target an understanding of the mechanisms or neurophysiology of both DC and AC methods of neuromodulation, as well as results for a broad range of m ental health conditions, particularly depression, past studies of which have not been well controlled. Bipolar disorder has not been studied at all, although the anecdotal evidence is positive. The Brown et al . II chapter co -authored by Kirsch contains an extensive discussion of the evidence, which is very promising. It states that there are three small, randomized, double -blind, sham -controlled studies showing the promise of CES.24 To the studies described by Mischoulon, Brown et al . II add a small study of 48 subjects , showing the effectiveness of CES in reducing assaultive behavior by up to 41% .25 Only two of the 48 subjects failed to respond to CES. In a review of the efficacy of various forms of brain stimulation in the treatment of PTSD, Novakovic et al. found CES to be the most promising because of its demonstrated efficacy in treating anxiety: \"There are no published studies of CES for PTSD. A meta - CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents analysis conducted at the Harvard School of Public Health concluded that CES was significantly more effect ive than sham treatment in improving anxiety but that inconsistent study methodology and lack of blinding complicated interpretation of these data (Klawansky et al., 1995). Recently, better controlled studies have been performed, which may be relevant in c onsidering this treatment for PTSD.... In light of these studies, the relative safety and affordability of CES makes it an interesting target for further research in PTSD.\"26 MHA encourages additional research to determine whether the promise of CES can be fulfilled, without the serious side effects of large -current ECT, TES, or deep brain stimulation (higher -intensity forms of brain stimulation). 14. DRUG INTERACTIONS : None noted. 15. SIDE EFFECTS : There are no known contraindications to the use of CES. According t o Brown, side effects are uncommon (between 3 and 10% -- Brown et al . II estimates under 1%) and of minimal severity (e.g., rarely skin irritation at the site of electrode placement, headaches, light -headedness, or increased jitteriness as occurs with othe r antidepressants), generally resolved when electrodes are moved or current is reduced.27 Brown et al II state that: \"no serious adverse effect has ever been reported from using CES.\"28 The sole negative finding in the literature was a 1996 animal study cit ed by Brown et al II that found lower fetal weights in the CES group.29 Because the animals treated with CES were not as active and did not eat as much, their fetuses were smaller. There is no evidence that CES treatment causes humans to be less active or e at less, so this finding is of doubtful relevance to human health. Differential effects on children remain to be tested. The only side effects noted by Brown were feeling \"spacey\" or \"woozy\" after the treatment and perceiving a flashing light after the session due to stimulation of the optic nerve by the device. After a CES treatment, users generally are in an \"alert, yet relaxed\" state, characterized by increased alpha and decreased delta brain waves as seen on EEG.30 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 16. DOSAGE : Brown and Gerbarg state that C ES treatments usually last 20 to 30 minutes, once or twice a day depending on the severity of the underlying condition. \"The advantages of [CES] are that it is very safe, even for young children, when used in the correct doses. It can be used to improve re sponse to medications [adjunctive use], to reduce the dose of medications, and sometimes to eliminate medications.\"31 The manufacturer of the Fisher - Wallace device advises a dose of 2 mA for 20 minutes, and recent studies have used that dose, but Mischoulon calls for further study to establish the appropriate dose. In its 2012 review, the FDA took issue with the lack of additional precisions about the amount of CES to be administered in the absence of studies showing the differential effects: \"...there has bee n no systematic attempt to determine the set of stimulation characteristics that are necessary for effectiveness. As the literature reviews have shown, there is little consensus about any of the characteristics. Electrode placement is also variable.\"32 17. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike most of the other CAM treatments included in this outline, the use of CES in the treatment of psychological conditions is not yet supported by multiple double -blind, placebo -controlled sources, and there is controversy about how to mask sham treatment. However, the low incidence of side effects, the FDA's 2014 decision, the clinical experience of Brown and Gerbarg, and the promising findings in some available studies counsel responsible consumer use as more data are being developed. 18. RESEA RCH: Long -term outcomes -- benefits and liabilities from continuing electrical field treatment and comparative assessment with other treatments -- require further investigation, as do the systematic tracking, reporting and quantification of adverse effects . Research on the use of CES in children and during pregnancy, studies of different devices and dosages, and larger, double -blind studies of treatment efficacy would be particularly helpful.

Other promising areas of research include treat ing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia . However, TMS is expensive compared to CES, and the Cochrane Collaboration seriously questions its efficacy. TMS is experimental, not s upported by persuasive clinical evidence or endorsed by any source, and usually not reimbursed by insurance. Moreover, unlike CES, TMS treatments require a therapist in attendance and are expensive. SIDE EFFECTS No drug interactions have been noted. Singl e pulse TMS stimulation is considered safer than repetitive TMS (\"rTMS\"). However, in rare cases, seizures may follow single pulse TMS stimulation in people with stroke o r other disorders involving the central nervous system. RTMS has been reported to cause seizures in individuals without pre -existing conditions when certain combinations of stimulation frequency and intensity are used, and guidelines have been developed to avoid this. Common adverse effects of rTMS are discomfort or pain from the stimulation of the scalp and associated nerves and muscles on the overlying skin. This is more common with rTMS than single pulse TMS. CONCLUSION Promising, but not yet proven. But given minimal side effects, experimentation with TMS is a reasonable choice if other treatments prove ineffective or poorly tol erated. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Photo Gallery CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents NeuroStar Brand Unknown Brainsway OUTLINE EFFICACY DRUG INTERACTIONS CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents SIDE EFFECTS CONCLUSIONS RESEARCH 1. The first successful transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study was performed in 1985 by Anthony Barker in Sheffield , England .1 A January, 2007 review panel of the United States Food and Drug Administration failed to approve a TMS device, stating it had a good safety record but failed to demonstrate it was effective for the treatment of depression. Nearly two years later in December of 2008, the FDA approved the use of a TMS device \"for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in adult patients who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from one prior antidepressant medication at or above the minimal effective dose and duration in the current episode.\"2 2. None of the cited sources discusses TMS. This discussion is included in the outline in order to contrast TMS with CES, a comparison that points to the superior (though still unproven) efficacy, less side effects, and lower cost of CES. Also, unlike CES, it is difficult to establish a convincing form of \"sham\" TMS to test for placebo effects in conscious individuals, due to the neck pain, headache and twitching in the scalp or upper face associated with the TMS intervention. \"Sham\" TMS manipulations can affect cerebral glucose metabolism and MEPs, which may confound results. This problem is exacerbated when using subjective measures of improvement. Depending on the research question asked and the experimental design , matching this discomfort to distinguish true effects of TMS can be an impor tant and challenging issue. 3. TMS is classified as a Class II device, placing it, probably only temporarily, at a level of assigned risk below that of CES. In July 2011 the FDA published a final rule in the Federal Register that classified the rTMS system into Class II (special controls), \"in order to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of these devices.\" The rule identified the rTMS system as , \"an exte rnal device that delivers transcranial pulsed magnetic fields of CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents sufficient magnitude to induce neural action potentials in the prefrontal cortex to treat the symptoms of major depressive disorder without inducing seizure in patients who have failed at lea st one antidepressant medication and are currently not on any antidepressant therapy.\" The exact details of how TMS functions are still being explored. TMS can be divided into two types depending on the mode of stimulation: Single or paired pulse TMS cause s neurons in the neocortex under the site of stimulation to depolarize and discharge an actio n potential . Repetitive TMS (\"rTMS\") produces longer -lasting effects which persist past the initial period of stimulation. rTMS can increase or decrease the excitability of the corticospinal tract . The mechanism of these effects is not clear although it is widely believed to reflect changes in synaptic efficacy akin to long -term potentiation (LTP) and long -term depression (LTD).3 4. EFFICACY A 2003 depression meta -analysis by Gershon et al .4 found that m ost data support an antidepressan t effect of high -frequency repetitive TMS administered to the left prefrontal cortex. The absence of psychosis, younger age, and certain brain physiological markers might predict treatment success. Technical parameters possibly affecting treatment success include intensity and duration of treatment, but these suggestions require systematic testing.5 Gershon et al . concluded that: \"41% of 139 patients treated with high -frequency rTMS to the left prefrontal cortex achieved either a 50% decrease in their Hamil ton depression scale scores or a fina l score of 8. Recent studies have pointed to, but not yet proven, longer treatment courses, more magnetic pulses, and increased field intensity as likely contributors to treatment success, even when rTMS is the only antidepressant therapy, and have produc ed results with rTMS that are comparable to those of ECT .\"6 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents But Gershon et al. added that TMS is comparable to ECT in efficacy only when there is no indication of psychosis: \"Four studies have compared high -frequency rTMS with ECT. These studies are parti cularly important because if rTMS, with its more benign side effect profile, is as effective as ECT even for only a subset of people, then it might provide a safer and more tolerable alternative. For people experiencing psychosis, ECT was clearly superior to rTMS, with 10 of 10 patients responding to ECT but only two of nine responding to rTMS. But among people not experiencing psychosis, both treatments met with similar success rates, with six (60%) of 10 patients responding to ECT and seven (64%) of 11 re sponding to rTMS .\"7 The Mayo Clinic says that electromagnets \"may hold some potential for treating conditions such as depression.\" 8 On the other hand, 2003 and 2009 Cochrane reviews , prepared and maintained by The Cochrane Collaboration, found inadequate evidence to recommend the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of obsessive -compulsive disorder or depression .9 Sixteen trials were included in the reviews and fourteen contained data in a suitable form for quantitative analysis. Mos t comparisons did not show differences between rTMS and other interventions. No difference was seen between rTMS and sham TMS using the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale , except for one time period (after two weeks of treatm ent) for left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency; and also for right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and low frequency, both in favor of rTMS and both using the Hamilton scale. Comparison of rTMS (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency) with electroconvulsive therapy showed no difference except for psychotic patients after two weeks treatment, using the Hamilton scale, which indicated that electroconvulsive therapy was more effective than rTMS .10 The information in the Cochrane reviews suggests that, \"there is no strong evidence for benefit from using transcranial magnetic stimulation to treat depression or obsessive - CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents compulsive disorder, although the small sample sizes do not exclude the possibility of benefit.\"11 5. DRUG INTERACTIO NS: None noted. 6. SIDE EFFECTS : Although TMS is often regarded as safe, the greatest acute risk of TMS is the rare occurrence of induced seizures . Single pulse TMS is regarded as safer, but seizures may still occur. Seizures are most likely in people with stroke or other disorders involving the central nervous system. RTMS has been reported to cause seizures in individuals without pre -existing conditions when certain combinations of stimulation frequency and intensity are used, and guidelines have been developed to minimize this risk. More than 16 cases of TMS -related seizure have been report ed in the literature, with at least seven reported before the publication of safety guidelines in 1998, and more than nine reported afterwards. The seizures have been associated with single -pulse and rTMS. Reports have stated that in at least some cases, p redisposing factors (medication, brain lesions or genetic susceptibility) may have contributed to the seizure. A review of nine seizures associated with rTMS that had been reported after 1998 stated that four seizures were within the safety parameters, fou r were outside of those parameters, and one had occurred in a healthy volunteer with no predisposing factors. A 2009 international consensus statement on TMS concluded that based on the number of studies, subjects and patients involved with TMS research, t he risk of seizure with rTMS is considered very low.12 Besides seizures, other risks include fainting , minor pains such as headache or local discomfort, minor cognitive changes and psychiatric symptoms (particularly a low risk of mania in depressed patients). Though other side effects are thought to be possibly associated with TMS (alterations to the endocrine system , altered neurotransmitter and immune system activity), they are considered \"investigational\" and lacking substantive proof.13 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents According to Wikipedia, the most common adverse effects of rTMS are: Discomfort or pain from the stimulation of the scalp and assoc iated nerves and muscles on the overlying skin. This is more common with rTMS than single pulse TMS. Rapid deformation of the T MS coil produces a loud clicking sound which increases with the stimulator intensity that can affect hearing with sufficient exposure, particularly relevant for rTMS (hearing protection may be used to prevent this). rTMS in the presence of EEG electrodes can result in electrode heating and, in severe cases, skin burns.14 7. CONCLUSIONS : TMS has been found effective for treatment -resistant major depression and has been approved for this use in Europe, Canada, Australia, and the United States. Other promising areas of research include treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia . However, the Cochrane Collaboration seriously questions the efficacy of TMS. Nonetheless, TMS needs more investigation, directed to an understanding of the neurophysiology of magnetic stimulation of the brain, and how it compares with DC or AC stimulation of the brain. These are fascinating findings in search of good clinical studies and needed developments in our understanding of the effects of various kinds of brain stimulation. TMS is experimental, not supported by persuasive clinical evidence, and usually not reimbursed by insurance. Moreover, treatments require a therapist and are very expensive compared to CES. However, though apparently greater than CES, the low incidence of side effects with TMS and the suggestive - though controverted -- findings in s mall studies require additional research attention and counsel responsible consumer use as the data are being developed.

Low folate levels have been associated with depression and dementia in some studies -- those studies need to be u pdated to take account of the widespread use of fortified grain products (required in the U.S. since 1998) and B vitamin supplements (B6 and B12 in addition to B9). Folate issues Folate is easily inactivated by cooking and processing food, and folate level s may be affected by many other factors, including chronic disease, diabetes and other metabolic problems, cancer, smoking, alcohol use, poor diet, and medications such as mood stabilizers, L -dopa, statins, oral anti-diabetic drugs, and cancer chemotherapy . In addition, genetic variations in the MTHFR gene may reduce the ability to benefit fully from oral folate supplements, and may be related to folate deficiency. Thus, folate levels should be tested before more intrusive treatment is used for depression o r mild cognitive impairment. Efficacy A 2009 review coauthored by Mischoulon showed methylfolate supplementation to be effective as an adjunctive therapy with psychotropic drugs or as a stand -alone treatment for both men and women in: reducing depressive symptoms in people with normal and low folate levels, improving cognitive function and reducing depressive symptoms in elderly people with folate deficiency, and 90 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents reducing depressive and other symptoms in people with depression and alcoholism. The risk i s minimal. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS Depression Folate is a promising stand -alone and adjunctive treatment for depression. Supplementation of folate deficiencies is recommended by five sources and only disavowed by one, the Natural Standard , and adjunctiv e treatment of depression with folate is a promising practice, especially for women, even if folate levels are not low. Although the Natural Standard concedes that folate has been used adjunctively, for enhancing treatment response to antidepressants, it d oes not credit the evidence in its rating. Two of the sources counsel supplementation even in the absence of folate deficiency, and while one leading researcher (Bottiglieri) does not explicitly concur with that recommendation, his description of the rese arch would place him in the same camp. Another leading researcher (Mischoulon) does not view folate supplementation as effective in people with normal folate levels. Neuroprotection Researchers have observed some potential positive effects of folate and ot her B vitamins (B6 and B12 in addition to B9) on the aging brain, , but folate supplementation appears to be a promising practice only for mild cognitive impairment. Like ginkgo biloba (see that topic), it may not help prevent or treat dementia. Still, alm ost everyone should be sure to eat lots of leafy green vegetables (and fortified grains, if they are well tolerated) --especially as they get older and their appetites decrease and maladies multiply. And B vitamin supplements are a prudent neuroprotectan t. SIDE EFFECTS & DRUG INTERACTIONS Aside from allergic reactions, folate and B vitamins are generally quite safe. However, the Natural Standard lists many medical conditions that may require folate supplementation and possible prescription drug interactions which should be considered by prescribing physicians. 91 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents No interactions with psychotropic drugs have been noted. Folate is not toxic. There appears to be no reason for children or pregnant or lactating women to avoid folate. CONCLUSION Promising, but not y et proven. Folate is especially promising for depression if lithium or SSRIs are ineffective or poorly tolerated, and it is particularly promising for women. Folate is also promising for mild cognitive impairment. A diet rich in leafy green vegetables is good for almost everyone. B vitamin supplements are a prudent neuroprotectant. OUTLINE EFFICACY: DEPRESSION METHYLFOLATE SUGGESTED BUT UNPROV EN USE: NEUROPROTECTION DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS DOSAGE 1. Folic acid (also known as vitamin B 9 or folacin) and folate (the naturally o ccurring form), as well (leucovorin), pteroyl -L-glutamic acid and pteroyl -L-glutamate , forms of the water -soluble vitamin B 9. Folate is not biologically active. Its biological importance is due to its production of L -methyl tetrahydrofolate (known as methylfolate) and other derivati ves after its conversion to dihydrofolic acid in the liver. 92 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 2. Folate is essential to numerous bodily functions ranging from nucleotide biosynthesis to the remethylation of homocysteine . The human body needs folate to synthesi ze DNA, repair DNA, and methylate DNA as well as to act as a cofactor in other biological reactions. 3. Folate and vitamin B12 are required for the synthesis of S -adenosyl -L-methionine (SAM -e). SAM -e is involved in numerous methylation reactions involving p roteins, phospholipids, DNA, and neurotransmitter metabolism, and is discussed in a separate chapter of this outline. These are critical protective processes for the brain to ward off depression. 4. Children and adults both require folic acid in order to produce healthy red blood cells and prevent anemia . 5. Folate and folic acid derive their names from the Latin word folium (which means \"leaf\"). Leafy vegetables are a principal source, although, in Western diets, fortified cereals and bread may be a larger dietary source. Fortification of grains with folate has been required in the U.S. since 1998. Lake and Spiegel caution that folate is easily inactivated by cooking and processing. 6. According to Brown et al ., \"the most important vitamins and nutrients for mental health are those that are essential for the functioning of nerve cells and those that are likely to be depleted due to poor nutrition, malabsorption, rapid utilization, or deterioration due to illness or environmental stress.\"1 Folate is a prime example. 7. Brown et al . caution that folate levels may be affected by chronic disease, diabetes, cancer, smoking, alcohol use, poor diet, and medications such as mood stabilizers, L -dopa, statins, oral anti -diabetic drugs, and cancer chemotherapy. 8. Several older studies found that up to 35% of depressed patients are folate deficient. In older people, the in cidence of deficiency was even more marked and might still be as high 93 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents as 90%. However, at least in the U.S., FDA -required folate supplementation of grain products since 1998 and higher public awareness of the need for B -vitamin consumption and supplementat ion have reduced the relevance of these studies. 9. EFFICACY: DEPRESSION: Folate is a promising monotherapy and adjunctive treatment for depression. Supplementation of folate deficiencies is recommended by five sources and only disavowed by one, and adjunct ive treatment of depression with folate is a promising practice, especially for women, even if blood serum folate levels are not low. Two (implicitly, three) of the sources counsel supplementation even in the absence of folate deficiency. According to Fug h-Berman and Cott, folate deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies in the world and has often been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. This deficiency may be an understudied risk factor for depression, especially since studies have shown that folate deficiency can significantly reduce the efficacy of prescribed antidepressants. Fugh -Berman and Cott recommend folate supplementation as an adjunctive treatment for depression based principally on a study by Fava et al. (1997),2 which examined the relationships between levels of folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine and response to fluoxetine (Prozac) (20 mg per day for 8 weeks) treatment in 213 outpatients with major depressive disorder. Response to treatment was determined by the per centage change in score on the HAM -D depression scare. Subjects with low folate levels were more likely to have melancholic depression and were significantly less likely to respond to fluoxetine. The researchers concluded that there was a link between low folate levels and poorer response to antidepressant treatment. They suggested that folate levels be considered in the evaluation of depressed people who do not respond to antidepressant treatment. Relying on the scholarly work of Bottiglieri,3 Brown et al . note that low levels of folate (B9) and other B vitamins (B6 and B12) are associated with depression and with genetic precursors of depression. They posit that folate deficiency is likely to suppress 94 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents remethylation of homocysteine , thus reducing the body's production of SAM -e, which may have serious effects on mood. Recent genetic studies may explain why som e individuals respond better to folate supplementation than others. The methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene limits the conversions of folic acid to L -methyltetrahydrofolate (known as methylfolate), the biologically active form. Genetic varia tions in the MTHFR gene may reduce the ability to benefit fully from oral folate supplements, and may be related to folate deficiency. Both Lake and Spiegel and Brown and Gerbarg emphasize this critical genetic factor. Individuals who do not respond adequ ately to folate supplements can be tested for MTHFR variants. Those found to be positive for the variants can be treated with methylfolate which avoids the need for conversion. The 2000 Coppen and Bailey study4 showed that 93% of women had a good response to a mixture of folate and the antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac), while only 61% of the group of women who received only placebo in addition to fluoxetine had a good response . The dose was 500 mcg per day. Women in the Coppen and Bailey study achieved a 20.6% reduction of homocysteine on fluoxitine and folate, while the men got no apparent benefit. Like Brown et al ., Mischoulon and Rosenbaum cite Bottiglieri's research on the effect of folate deficiency on the cycle that furnishes the body with SAM -e, and the resultant deficiency of SAM -e and elevation of homocysteine levels that are associated with depression.5 But they concede that supplementation with folate may not release or furnish SAM -e or lower homocysteine. Although the link with vitamin B12 de ficiency is not so strong or clear, at least in younger people, a 2007 meta -analysis by Gilbody et al .6 is cited by Mischoulon and Rosenbaum for the proposition that there is a \"robust\" relationship between low folate and depression , but much more so in wo men than in men .7 The 1997 Fava et al. study cited by both Fugh -Berman and Cott and Brown et al ., is cited by Mischoulon and Rosenbaum for the proposition that pretreatment folate status was 95 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents significantly related to treatment response. Thus, without suppl ementation, low folate appeared to inhibit people's response to SSRIs. This result was replicated in the 2005 Papacostas et al. study which linked the timing of lithium and SSRI treatment effectiveness and the risk of relapse to low pretreatment folate le vels, using fluoxetine, lithium, and desipramine (Norpramin) .8 The seven subjects with low folate levels had a 43% relapse rate, compared to 3% for the 64 with normal folate levels. Conversely, when people with folate deficiencies received supplementation with methylfolate to counteract low folate levels, a small 1990 study showed an improved treatment response. This study was criticized because the non -CAM treatments were diverse and not comparable.9 In the 2002 Alpert et al . open label study in which Mis choulon participated, adjunctive use of folinic acid with an SSRI produced more than 50% improvement in more than 25% of the subjects.10 No individuals in this group were folate -deficient. The dose was 15-30 mg per day of folinic acid, which is metabolized to methylfolate. Of 22 subjects who had minimally responded to 4 weeks of SSRI treatment prior to folate supplementation, 33% improved, and 19% achieved full remission. The effect was not limited to women. A 2009 Fava and Mischoulon review11 yielded firmer conclusions : \"The methylfolate formulation indicated efficacy as adjunctive therapy or monotherapy in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with normal and low folate levels , improving cognitive function and reducing depressive symptoms in elderly pati ents with dementia and folate deficiency, and reducing depressive and somatic symptoms in patients with depression and alcoholism. \" The noted effects were not limited to women. In Brown et al . II, Bottiglieri analyses the six randomized studies that have f ocused on folate supplementation for depression, all but one of which has been adjunctive with use of lithium or SSRIs. He concludes that they show promise, even in the absence of folate deficiency. He also cites the 2012 series of trials conducted by Papa costos et al . (and still not posted on PubMed) that \"support the use of methylfolate as an 96 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents adjunctive treatment for SSRI -resistent depression\" even in the absence of baseline folate deficiency.12 The Natural Standard rates folate for depression as \"C,\" \"un clear scientific evidence for this use.\" The Natural Standard rates folate as \"A,\" \"strong scientific evidence for this use,\" only for folate deficiency and related anemia. As to depression, the Natural Standard states only that folic acid deficiency has b een found among people with depression and has been linked to poor response to antidepressants. Although the Natural Standard concedes that folate has been used adjunctively, for enhancing treatment response to antidepressants, it does not credit the evide nce in its rating. The Natural Standard states that folate is \"not effective\" as a replacement for antidepressants, but it does not comment on adjunctive use . Berkeley Wellness does not discuss any effect of folate on depression, focusing instead on demen tia, for which it reports contradictory findings. Notwithstanding the promising studies and the 2007 meta -analysis and 2009 review, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum conclude that the data are still too preliminary to recommend consumer action beyond supplementati on of folate deficiencies at this point. They suggest that assessment of folate status ought to be included in any comprehensive medical workup for depression and that folate replacement is essential for individuals with conditions leading to folate defic iency, such as alcoholism, metabolic problems, and malabsorption. They add that blood tests for folate may not be enough, that SAM -e and homocysteine levels may be as important, and that genetics (the common mutations of the MTHFR enzyme gene discussed abo ve) also must be evaluated. Lake and Spiegel observe that the proportion of folate deficiency \"appears to correlate with the severity of psychiatric symptoms. Even among individuals with normal folate levels, higher folate levels are correlated with less severe depression, higher age at onset,\"13 and improved response to antidepressants. The Mayo Clinic is also positive, giving folate a green light as a supplement, but without any discussion of potential use for depression or cognition . 97 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Weil recommends supp lementation with 400 mcg per day of folic acid to prevent and treat mental health conditions. He recommends a comprehensive vitamin and mineral supplementation program, including B6 and B12 as well as folate.14 On balance, the data concerning adjunctive use of folate show such a dramatic effect that people, and especially women, considering or using psychotropic medications may reasonably wish to discuss the possibility of folate supplementation with the prescribing physician. No drug interaction has yet be en noted by any source between folate and psychotropic medications, and the remaining risk is low. In the case of SSRI -resistent depression, folate seems particularly valuable to try, and the risk is low. 10. METHYLFOLATE: Mischoulon et al . strongly advocate methylfolate for folate supplementation, to bypass the conversion process. Brown et al. note that MTHFR genetic testing can identify individuals most likely to have a better response to supplementation with methylfolate rather than folic acid. 11. SUGGESTED B UT UNPROVEN USE: NEUROPROTECTION : Brown et al . discuss the use of folate supplementation for cognition and memory disorders , citing the promising (albeit very preliminary) research linking B vitamins to cognitive performance.15 In a chapter authored by Bot tiglieri, Brown et al . II discuss the conflicting results of seven trials, concluding that folate and other B vitamins \"may slow the rate of cognitive decline in subjects less severely affected at baseline .\"16 Thus, folate is a promising treatment for mild cognitive impairment, but, like ginkgo, may not be effective to prevent or treat Alzheimer's dementia. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum recommend methylfolate over folate as less toxic for older people with mild cognitive impairment because it crosses the blood - brain barrier .17 Lake and Spiegel note that higher folate levels correlate with higher scores on the Mini -Mental State Exam. Berkeley Wellness discusses potential use of folate for prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia but asserts, as conceded by all of the sources, that studies on the effects of taking folic acid have yielded contradictory findings. B vitamins (B6 and B12 in addition to folate) appear to help with 98 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents cognition, but the role of folate is unclear, and effects on dementia ha ve not been demonstrated. Still, folate is a promising neuroprotectant. B vitamins should be part of any strategy to maintain healthy thinking and feeling as our brains age. 12. DRUG INTERACTIONS : The Natural Standard cites reduced serum folate levels in wome n taking conjugated estrogens (Premarin) or birth control pills and (theoretically) with estrogenic herbs and supplements. Alcohol, smoking, aspirin, antacids, antibiotics, carbamazepine folate levels, though in different ways. Taking folic acid with vitamin B -12 may increase the risk of B -12 deficiency (because it may be screened by folic acid). 13. SIDE EFFECTS: Aside from allergic reactions, folate and B vitamins are described by Brown et al . as \"generally qu ite safe .\" The Natural Standard states that folate is \" generally well tolerated in standard doses .\" However, stomach upset, hair loss, myelosupression (bone marrow suppression), zinc depletion, erythema (skin inflammation), pruritus (skin itch), urticari a (hives), nausea, bloating, flatulence, cramps, bitter taste, diarrhea, anemias caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, irritability, excitability, malaise, altered sleep patterns, vivid dreaming, overactivity, confusion, impaired judgment, increased seizure fr equency and psychotic behavior have been reported. Significant central nervous system side effects have been observed with high doses. 99 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents In addition to the side effects reported by the Natural Standard , below, Mischoulon, Fava and Stahl replied to a letter i n the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in June, 2009,18 to concerns about folate masking Vitamin B -12 deficiencies or affecting colorectal cancer. Mischoulon et al. conceded that folate supplementation could mask a vitamin B -12 deficiency , requiring extra car e for vulnerable people. Brown et al . point out that this problem of masking can be reduced by testing serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels. As to cancer risk, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum give evidence for and against but in the end recommend only counseling caution for people with a history of polyps or a family history of colorectal cancer. The Natural Standard gives age -calibrated dosages for children; Berkeley Wellness gives a dose for pregnant women. Fugh -Berman adds that \"we give folate speci fically to women, and it's water -soluble so you can't overdose.\" Thus, there appears to be no reason for children or pregnant or lactating women to avoid folate. 14. DOSAGE: The Natural Standard recommends: For infants up to 6 months old, 65 mcg. per day, 7 - 12 months, 80 mcg. per day, 1 -3 years, 150 mcg. per day, 4 -8 years, 200 mcg. per day, 9 - 13 years, 300 mcg. per day, 14 -18 years, a maximum of 800 mcg per day, and adults, a maximum of 1,000 mcg per day . Recommended dosages are 400 mcg per day for adults, increasing to 500 mcg per day for breastfeeding women and 600 mcg per day for pregnant women. For adjunct treatment with antidepressants, the Natural Standard states that dosages of from 200 to 500 mcg per day have been used . Berkeley Wellness is co ncerned about over -supplementation: The recommended dietary allowance for folate is 400-1000 mcg per day for adults and 600 mcg per day for pregnant women. But many Americans get much more than that, since about 40% of those over age 60 take a multivitamin , which typically supplies the recommended dietary allowance of folate. In addition, many people take a supplement of B vitamins 100 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents and eat highly fortified foods, which risks excessive consumption of folate. But folate is non-toxic , so the effect should be t he same as eating too many leafy green vegetables. Weil recommends 400 mcg per day. In contrast, one of the cited studies used 15 -30 mg per day - 15,000 to 30,000 mcg. This discrepancy is disturbing, and Berkeley Wellness's concerns caution that the lower dosages are more appropriate. Commenting on the discrepancy, Lake and Spiegel state that there is evidence that people with affective disorders or schizophrenia may have higher requirements. They recommend 1 mg (1000 mcg) per day and recommend that folate be coupled with 2.4 mcg of B12 per day to avoid masking a B12 deficiency. 15. RESEARCH: More rigorous, randomized studies are needed to address important clinical questions regarding the magnitude of the effect of folate compared with standard therapies as compared across different oral folate doses and folate forms, including folic acid, methylfolate, and folinic acid. Further investigation of possible predictors of response would help identify the people most likely to benefit from folate supplementation. Genetic variations require additional study, following up on the MTHFR gene studies. Gender differences and the effect of folate supplementation in the absence of baseline folate deficiency require concerted research. Long -term outcomes -- benefits and lia bilities from continuing treatment with folate, measuring precise folate levels through the treatment cycle and comparative assessment with other drugs -- require further investigation, as do the systematic tracking, reporting and quantification of adverse effects. 1 How to Use Herbs, Nutrients & Yoga in Mental Health Care, by Richard P.

In its neuroprotective role, the blood -brain barrier functions to hinder the delivery of many potentially important diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the brain. Therapeutic molecules and genes that might otherwise be effective in diagnosis and therapy do not cross the BBB in adequate amounts. Mechanisms for drug targeting in the brain involve going either \"through\" or \"behind\" the BBB. 18 J. Clinical Psychiatry 70:5 (May, 2009). 102 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents GINKGO BILOBA AS A POTENTIAL NEUROPROTECTANT SUMMARY WHAT WE KNOW Ginkgo biloba is an ancient Chinese herbal remedy that has been shown to have significant neuroprotective effects, confirmed by all sources. However, two recent major studies a nd a Cochrane review cast doubt on the validity of the prior, smaller and shorter studies, and determined that in the aggregate the data do not support the use of ginkgo in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease. The recent evidence is mostly negative, thou gh the studies are still inconsistent. Although g inkgo has a mild effect in protecting against mild cognitive impairment/dementia, it probably does not prevent it. But all sources except one remain optimistic for some ongoing neuroprotective role for Ginkg o. The risk is minimal. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS Neuroprotection: Despite the evidence from these studies and review, all sources except Berkeley Wellness remain optimistic for some ongoing neuroprotective role for ginkgo. Pending subsequent studies, the jury is still out on ginkgo and memory/dementia. Until a scientific and popular consensus emerges, ginkgo will continue to be used as one of the few known neuroprotective CAM treatments for dementia, preventing and treating memory impairment, lack of conc entration, and cerebral -vascular insufficiency, as well as age -related and dementia -related cognitive weaknesses. Alternatives : Rhodiola, SAM -e, folate, omega -3s, and CDP -choline (see those chapters of this outline) may provide alternatives now that ginkg o has been shown to be less effective a remedy than it had long been supposed to be. 103 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents No Reason to Stop : The recent negative evidence should lead consumers to question the efficacy of ginkgo to prevent or delay cognitive impairment. However, a single study cannot be viewed as definitive, and ginkgo may be considered as an evidence -based CAM treatment for mild and possibly incipient dementia, albeit apparently with limited preventive benefit in delaying or avoiding some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. If you are using ginkgo and tolerating it well, there is no reason to stop. Other Uses : Ginkgo is being investigated as adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), for protection against the neural damage caus ed by antipsychotics, and for the treatment of depression. The Natural Standard also states that \"good\" evidence demonstrates ginkgo's efficacy in the treatment of \"cerebral insufficiency.\" But these are at best promising practices. These are all unproven uses, but given ginkgo's relatively low cost and benign risk profile, consumers may well wish to try ginkgo for these conditions. Caution is advisable if ginkgo is used with psychotropic drugs, in the absence of studies validating lack of adverse drug interactions. Adjunctive treatment with antipsychotics requires careful coordination with the prescribing physician. DRUG INTERACTIONS Ginkgo has anticoagulant effects (though bleeding problems have not been noted in the studies), may increase blood concentra tions of some drugs used for treating hypertension, may affect insulin and blood sugar levels, and may affect blood pressure. Potential interactions with MAOI, SSRI and antipsychotic drugs have been noted, but have not yet been confirmed in humans. The pre scribing physician should be consulted before using ginkgo in connection with these drugs. SIDE EFFECTS According to Mischoulon and Rosenbaum, ginkgo \"has an excellent safety record; and except for the assumed possible risk of hemorrhage in patients takin g anticoagulants, having bleeding disorders, or [about to] undergo surgery, [ginkgo] appears to be very safe.\" All sources agree 104 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents that ginkgo appears safe overall and that side effects are rare. It follows that concerns about pregnancyy, breast -feeding and child use are minimal CONTAMINATION Berkeley Wellness cautions that commonly available products may be different than the preparations used in clinical studies. EGb 761 is the only preparation of ginkgo that should be used. And tests by ConsumerLab have fo und problems in some ginkgo products. For instance, in 2008, tests on seven of the most popular ginkgo products sold in the United States found that five were contaminated or low in key compounds. CONCLUSION Traditional uses of ginkgo as a neuroprotectant are now in question. The split of the sources confirms that this is a controversial supplement, and the recent evidence, from large -scale, long -term studies, is all negative. But the risk is minimal, and the sources continue to argue that ginkgo has neuro protective efficacy, even if it doesn't prevent Alzheimer's dementia. 105 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents OUTLINE EFFICACY: NEUROPROTECTION, BUT NOT PREVENTION SOURCES CHALLENGI NG GINKGO THE 2008 NCCAM -FUNDED GINKGO EVALUATION STUDY THE 2009 COCHRANE COLLABORATION META -ANALYSIS OF GINKGO STUDIES GUIDAGE STUDY CONCLUSIONS SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES : PROTECTION AGAINST THE NEURAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY ANTIPSYCHOTICS, DEPRESSION, ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD), SCHIZOPHRENIA, AN D SEXUAL SIDE EFFECTS OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS ADJUNCTIVE USE DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS DOSAGE CONTAMINATION RESEARCH 1. Common Names include ginkgo , Ginkgo biloba , fossil tree, maidenhair tree, baiguo, bai guo ye, kew tree, yinhsing (yin -hsing). Extracts are taken from the ginkgo leaf and are used to make tablets, capsules, or teas. In the past 30 years, methodical procedures of extraction and standardization among manufacturers and researchers has allowed the production of a highly concentrated and stabl e extract, EGb 761, which has been systematically studied in scientific programs. 106 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 2. EFFICACY: NEUROPROTECTION, BUT NOT PREVENTION: There is a large body of data to support the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba (EGb 761) (\"ginkgo\") as a neuro -protector and cer of neural functioning, well summarized by Fugh -Berman and Cott, Lake and Spiegel (through Lee, R., Yee, P.S. & Naing, G.) , Mischoulon and Rosenbaum and the Standard . However, Fugh -Berman, Brown et al. , Berkeley Wellness and the Mayo Clinic que stion ginkgo's effect on memory and specifically its apparent inability to prevent Alzheimer's dementia, based on the negative NCCAM -sponsored GEM study and Cochrane Collaboration meta -analysis. The recent evidence is mostly negative, including the 2012 publication of the GuidAge Study. But all sources except Berkeley Wellness remain optimistic for some ongoing neuroprotective role for Ginkgo: 3. SOURCES Writing in 1999, Fugh -Berman and Cott found support for the use of ginkgo for mild dementia from four cred ible double -blind studies and a meta -analysis of trials treatment for \"cerebral insufficiency. \"1 Fugh -Berman and Cott concluded that there is a small but significant effect of 3 to 6 months of treatment with 120 to 240 mg per day of gin kgo extract on objective measures of cognitive function. However, Fugh -Berman now states that ginkgo appears to be ineffective in preventing or delaying cognitive impairment. Fugh -Berman is persuaded that though ginkgo has a mild effect in treating dementi a (it's about as effective as conventional drugs used to treat dementia), it does not prevent it. Writing in 2006, Lake and Spiegel concluded that ginkgo, \"can be used for a number of conditions, including dementia and cerebral insufficiency ,\" citing the same studies used by Fugh -Berman and Cott.2 They noted that most reports of improvement had involved elderly subjects with some cognitive impairment and called for more extensive trials with healthy subjects. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum (through Amri, H., Mon es, A -A, Le Bars, P. & Kastelan, J.) consider the standardized EGb 761 ginkgo extract formula to be \"one of the most 107 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents highly recognized herbal supplements with well -proven efficacy. It is recommended for managing symptoms associated with a range of neurolog ic and vascular disorders including dementia .... It is approved for treatment of Alzheimer's disease in Belgium, the Czech Republic and Germany, and suggested for memory complaints in France and Spain. It is classified by the World Health Organization (\"WHO \") as among the available anti -dementia drugs.\"3 In addition, Germany's Commission E specifies use for primary degenerative dementia (mental degeneration due to aging), vascular dementia, and a combination of both .4 Mischoulon and Rosenbaum conclude that: \"there is a large body of data to support the efficacy of EGb761 as a neuroprotector and an enhancer of neural functioning. Evidence from biomedical research supports its effects on memory impairment, lack of concentration, cerebral -vascular insufficiency , as well as age -related and dementia - related cognitive weaknesses.\"5 Inconsistent results are explained as derived from the characteristics of the population studied, the type of outcome measurements selected, and the EGb 761 regimen tested in the trial. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum further conclude that: \"assessments measuring accuracy and speed, which are most closely related to working memory, better demonstrate the effect of EGP 761 rather than assessments that measure long -term storage and retrieval abil ities, regardless of the study population.\"6 They conclude that EGb 761: \" seems to enhance complex attention, speed of information processing, and the rate of working memory .\"7 With regard to the studies measuring EGb 761's effect on Alzheimer's disease, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum conclude that \"There are several large scale studies and literature analyses that support the prophylactic and treatment use of EGb 761 for Alzheimer dementia.\"8 In particular, they cite with approval the Oken et al .'s meta - analysi s of EGb 761's effect on Alzheimer's disease and associated dementia, which reviewed over 50 clinical studies and was relied on by Fugh -Berman and Cott. \"After applying several exclusion criteria, the authors concluded that their quantitative analysis of the literature showed a small significant effect on objective measures of cognitive 108 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents function in Alzheimer's disease after 3 to 6 months of treatment with 120 to 240 mg per day of EGb 761 .\"9 The 2010 edition of the Natural Standard continues to list use of g inkgo for \"dementia (multi -infact and Alzheimer's type)\" in scientific evidence for this use,\" stating: \"The scientific literature overall does suggest that ginkgo benefits people with early stage Alzheimer's disease and multi -infarct dementia and may be as helpful as acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs such as donepezil (Aricept) .\"10 The Natural Standard also states that \"good\" evidence demonstrates ginkgo's efficacy in the treatment of \"cerebral insufficiency\" (a syndrome seconda ry to atherosclerotic disease, characterized by impaired concentration, confusion, decreased physical performance, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, and anxiety, and commonly diagnosed in Europe). This is the \"B\" category: \"good scientific evidence for this use.\" Significantly, the 2010 edition of the Natural Standard does not cite the 2008 GEM study. Brown et al ., while agreeing that there is a small but significant effect of 3 to 6 months of treatment with 120 to 240 mg per day of ginkgo extract on memory, describe these effects as \"slight at best.\"11 However, Brown, et al. consider ginkgo to have neuro -protective effects and benefits for vascular dementia.12 Writing in Brown et al. II, Diamond, B.J. and Bailey, M.R., while citing all of the recent negative data, still summarize that ginkgo, \"has shown potential in ameliorating the effects of a variety of symptoms and disorders.\"13 The Mayo Clinic is counted as a negative because it relies on the 2008 NCCAM -funded study and the 2009 Cochran Collaborat ion meta -analysis to conclude that: \" Ginkgo doesn't reduce the risk of Alzheimer's or other dementias .\" But Mayo, like Brown et al ., remains optimistic for an ongoing neuro -protective role, acknowledging that \" some evidence\" shows \"benefit\" early -stage Alzheimer's disease and to as helpful as \"some [prescription] drugs.\" Mayo gives ginkgo a yellow \"caution\" light, stating that while studies have produced \"some encouraging results for the use of ginkgo as the treatment of ce rtain circulation disorders and what 109 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents are sometimes called cerebral insufficiencies -- symptoms such as absent -mindedness and confusion -- which may be associated with Alzheimer's disease.\"14 Still, Mayo concludes: \"Studies have found ginkgo isn't an overall 'brain booster,' and the safety and effectiveness of ginkgo haven't always been proved.\"15 Berkeley Wellness is the most critical of ginkgo, stating flatly that: \"Although ginkgo is one of the best studied herbs, there is no convincing evidence that it h as any effect on memory or other mental functions in healthy older people -- that is, it doesn't sharpen an already clear mind, help prevent what is considered normal age -related memory loss, or delay or prevent dementia.\"16 Berkeley Wellness concludes: \"If you or a family member has Alzheimer's or another dementia, talk to your doctor about trying ginkgo, but keep in mind that drug treatments may be better.\"17 Thus, Berkeley does not recommend ginkgo as a CAM treatment to slow or prevent memory of other co gnitive problems in healthy people. Based on the 2008 GEM study, Berkeley does not support prophylactic use of ginkgo to slow or avoid dementia, cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease. It has gone so far as to drop ginkgo from its list of dietary sup plements (in the 2011 edition ff.). 4. CHALLENGING GINKGO THE 2008 NCCAM -FUNDED GINKGO EVALUATION OF MEMORY (GEM) STUDY of the standardized ginkgo product, EGb 761, found it INEFFECTIVE in lowering the overall incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in older people with normal cognition. Further analysis of the data also found ginkgo to be ineffective in slowing cognitive decline.18 In this landmark clinical trial, researchers recruited more than 3,000 volunteers age 75 and over who took 240 mg of ginkgo or placebo daily, in two doses. Participants were followed for an average of approximately 6 years. Five hundred twenty -three individuals developed dementia (246 receiving placebo and 277 receiving ginkgo ) with 92% of the dementia cases classified as pos sible or probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD), or AD with evidence of vascular disease of the brain. Rates of dropout and loss to follow -up were low (6.3%), and the adverse effect profiles were 110 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents similar for both groups. The overall dementia rate was 3.3 per 10 0 person years in participants assigned to ginkgo and 2.9 per 100 person -years in the placebo group. The hazard ratio (HR) for ginkgo compared with placebo for all cause dementia was 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 -1.33; P=.21) and for AD, 1.16 (9 5% CI, 0.97 -1.39; P=.11). Ginkgo also had no effect on the rate of progression to dementia in participants with MCI (\"mild cognitive impairment\") (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.85 STUDY CONCLUSION: \" In this study, ginkgo at 120 mg twice a day was not effective in reducing either the overall incidence rate of dementia or Alzheimer's disease incidence in elderly individuals with normal cognition ....\"20 This conclusion cast doubt on the conclusions quoted above. THE 2009 COCHRANE COLLABORATION META -ANAL YSIS OF GINKGO STUDIES cast further doubt on the validity of prior, more limited, biomedical research supporting ginkgo's effects, concluding that \"the evidence that Ginkgo biloba has predictable and clinically significant benefit for people with dementia or cognitive impairment is inconsistent and unreliable.\"21 The 2009 Snitz, B.E. et al . study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association22 for the \"Ginkgo Ev aluation of Memory (GEM) Study Investigators \" determined there to be \"no evidence that ginkgo slows the rate of cognitive decline in older adults.\" New York Times , August 28, 2010 review of an NIH panel on Alzheimer's prevention: \" In the end, [the panel] said it was highly confident in the findings for just one thing, the herb ginkgo. But in that case the evidence pointed in only one direction: it did not prevent Alzheimer's.\" Contra, as part of the large longitudinal EPIDOS study in France, 69 Alzheimer' s patients were matched with 345 women with normal cognitive functioning. A multivariate analysis showed that treatment with vasodilators including EGb 761 for at least two years reduced the risk of developing Alzheimer dementia.23 Of four recent trials, t hree found no difference between ginkgo and placebo, but one reported very large treatment effects in favor of ginkgo. There were no significant 111 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents differences between ginkgo and placebo in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events. A subgrou p analysis including only patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (925 patients from nine trials) also showed no consistent pattern of any benefit associated with ginkgo. GUIDAGE STUDY: THE GINKGO EVA LUATION OF MEMORY (GEM) STUDY of the standardized ginkgo product, EGb 761, found it INEFFECTIVE in lowering the overall incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in older people with normal cognition. 2854 participants were randomly assigned, \"of whom 1406 received at least one dose of ginkgo biloba extract and 1414 received at least one dose of placebo. By 5 years, 61 participants in the ginkgo group had been diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease ( 1.2 cases per 100 person - years ) compared with 73 participants in the placebo group ( 1.4 cases per 100 person - years ; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b760 \u20141\u00b718; p=0\u00b7306), but the risk was not proportional over time. Incidence of adverse events was much the same between groups. 76 participants in the ginkgo group died compared with 82 participants in the placebo group (0\u00b794, 0\u00b769 \u20141\u00b728; p=0\u00b768). 65 participants in the ginkgo group had a stroke compared with 60 participants in the placebo group (risk ratio 1\u00b712, 95% CI 0\u00b777 \u20141\u00b763; p=0\u00b757). Incidence of other hae morrhagic or cardiovascular events also did not differ between groups.\"24 GUIDAGE STUDY CONCLUSION: Long -term use of standardized ginkgo biloba extract in this trial did not reduce the risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease compared with placebo.25 Given the inconsistent use pattern, some further analysis seems warranted. Analysis sponsored by a supplement manufacturer showed that ginkgo might yet be shown to protect the subgroup of long -term users: 15 out of 947 patients (1.6%) in the EGb 761 group who t ook ginkgo for at least four years converted to AD versus 29 out of 966 (3.0%) in the placebo group (statistically significant at p=0.03). However, the Guidage Study Group confirmed the Evaluation of Memory (GEM) Study conclusion that ginkgo did not preven t AD: Significantly, the manufacturer -sponsored early analysis of the 112 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents GuidAge results admitted that the results were not statistically significant for the study group as a whole.26 But for those unwilling to concede that Ginkgo is ineffective in preventin g AD, the remaining contention is: \"The brain pathology that leads to overt Alzheimer's disease develops over the course of many years. It is therefore not surprising that those study participants who developed dementia early in the study gained less prote ctive benefit from EGb 761 treatment, because they already had the disease. When these subjects as well as those who left the study prematurely (i.e., all study participants) were included in the analysis, the overall treatment effect was still detectable, although not statistically significant.\"27 Kaschel, professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Osnabruck, concluded: 'Meta -analyses of the data by independent scientists consistently substantiate the efficacy of EGb 761 at the onset of cog nitive decline.'\"28 Pending further analysis of the GuidAge and subsequent studies, though its efficacy is in serious doubt, the jury is still out on ginkgo. 5. CONCLUSIONS Until a scientific and popular consensus emerges, ginkgo will continue to be used as a neuro -protective CAM treatment for incipient dementia, in preventing and treating memory impairment, lack of concentration, and cerebral -vascular insufficiency, as well as age -related and dementia -related cognitive weaknesses. Absent any other obvious CA M alternative for preservation of cognitive faculties through the aging process, many researchers and health care practitioners are awaiting further developments before discarding ginkgo as a CAM treatment for mild cognitive impairment/dementia. If you are using ginkgo and tolerating it well, there is no reason to stop. However, the evidence counsels looking at additional CAM treatments for cognitive challenges, including rhodiola, SAM -e, folate, omega -3s, and CDP -choline , discussed in separate chapters of this outline. 113 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Despite the weight of the GEM, Cochrane and GuidAge results, recent NCCAM and National Institute on Aging results point to neuro -protective effects with long -term with regular use of ginkgo. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum conclude that EGb 761: \"se ems to enhance complex attention, speed of information processing, and the rate of working memory .\"29 This is an encouraging suggestion for those using or considering ginkgo supplementation, and consistent with the suggestion that supplementation at the on set of cognitive impairment may be significant in ginkgo's efficacy. But the efficacy of ginkgo in combating cognitive impairment is definitely controverted . 6. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES : PROTECTION AGAINST THE NEURAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY ANTIPSYCHOTICS, DEPRE SSION, ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD), SCHIZOPHRENIA, AND SEXUAL SIDE EFFECTS OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS : Brown, et al. recommend the use of ginkgo for protection against the neural damage caused by antipsychotics . In addition, the WHO and Germany list EGb 761 for the treatment of depression. This use is not supported by Lake and Spiegel. Weil, whose focus is mood disorders, does not mention ginkgo at all. The Natural Standard states that \"good\" evidence demonstrates ginkgo's efficacy in the treat ment of \" cerebral insufficiency \" (a syndrome secondary to atherosclerotic disease, characterized by impaired concentration, confusion, decreased physical performance, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, and anxiety, and commonly diagnosed in Europe). This is the \"B\" category. 7. ADJUNCTIVE USE Brown, et al. recommend the use of ginkgo as an adjuctive treatment for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Brown et al . and Mischoulon of thera py (with antipsychotics) for schizophrenia , citing the 2006 Zhang study.30 Lake and Spiegel discuss use of ginkgo with antidepressants to counteract sexual side effects . The studies are split on this use. 114 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Caution is advisable if ginkgo is used with psychotr opic drugs, especially antidepressants , in the absence of studies validating lack of adverse drug interactions. Although it is a suggested use, there is scant evidence in the sources consulted for the use of ginkgo for depression and no evidence about adju nctive use for depression. Adjunctive treatment with antipsychotics requires careful coordination with the prescribing physician, and adjunctive use with antidepressants requires extra precautions if it is to be attempted at all. 8. DRUG INTERACTIONS Accord ing to the Natural Standard , ginkgo has anticoagulant effects , may suppress platelet aggregation, and in rare cases has been associated with serious bleeding problems, and thus suggests that people with clotting disorders who are receiving any anticoagulan t therapy, such as warfarin (Coumadin), heparin, clopidogrel (Plavix), (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), or have scheduled surgery or dental procedures, should use caution and talk to a health care provider if using ginkgo. Fugh -Berman is skeptical about these concerns. She relies on studies that have shown no interaction with ticlopidine. None of the studies has n oted significant bleeding problems. The Natural Standard adds that ginkgo may increase blood concentrations of some drugs used for treating hypertension. Citing \"preliminary research,\" the Natural Standard also advises that ginkgo may affect insulin and blood sugar levels. Thus, caution is advised when medications that lower blood sugar are used. Ginkgo has also been found to affect blood pressure in healthy volunteers, although the studies disagree. The Natural Standard suggests that nifedipine should n ot be used in conjunction with ginkgo for this reason. 115 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents According to the Natural Standard , potential interactions with MAOI, SSRI and antipsychotic drugs have been noted , but have not yet been confirmed in humans . Thus , caution is appropriate to avoid the potential of serotonin syndrome , and the prescribing physician should be consulted before using ginkgo in connection with these drugs. Serotonin syndrome is a condition defined by muscle rigidity, fever, confusion, increased blood pressure and heart rate, and coma. Fugh -Berman is skeptical about these concerns. She relies on studies that have shown no interaction with diazepam (Valium) and others. In theory, ginkgo may increase the actions of drugs used for erectile dysfunction such as sildenafil (Viagra). In theory, drugs such as donepezil (Aricept) and tacrine (Cognex) may have an additive effect when used at the same time as ginkgo, particularly increasing salivation and urination. 9. SIDE EFFECTS Brown et al . describe gingko's side effects as \"minimal ,\" citing only headache, reduced platelet aggregation and interaction with anticoagulant drugs, and \" rare : agitation.\"31 Brown et al . counsel not to use ginkgo prior to surgery or dental procedures. Fugh - Berman and Cott concluded that \" side effects from the us e of ginkgo are rare . Side effects include nausea, headache, stomach problems, diarrhea, allergy, anxiety, and restlessness.32 According to Mischoulon and Rosenbaum, ginkgo, \" has an excellent safety record ; and except for the assumed possible risk of hemorr hage in patients taking anticoagulants, having bleeding disorders, or [about to] undergo surgery, EGb 761 appears to be very safe .\"33 Berkeley Wellness concurs that ginkgo appears safe overall. According to the Natural Standard , side effects of ginkgo may i nclude headache, nausea, gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, dizziness, palpitations, anxiety, allergy or allergic skin reactions (rashes) , bleeding, blood sugar levels, muscle weakness, loss of muscle tone, restlessness, racing heart, rash, and irritation a round the mouth, reduction of male and female fertility, and efficacy of electro -convulsive therapy. There may be a risk of seizure 116 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents when ginkgo is taken, particularly in people with a history of seizure disorder. However, most reports of seizures have been due to eating ginkgo seeds, rather than the leaf extract, which is the standardized study product. Still, according to the Natural Standard , overall, ginkgo leaf extract appears to be well tolerated at recommended doses for up to six months . Gingko's safety for children and during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown , but the concern is minimal . 10. DOSAGE: Study dosage is standardized at between 40 and 240 mg. per day of EGb 761. 11. CONTAMINATION: Berkeley Wellness cautions that commonly available products may be different than the preparations used in clinical studies. EGb 761 is the only preparation of ginkgo that should be used. And tests by ConsumerLab have found problems in some ginkgo products. For instance, in 2008, tests on seven of the most popular ginkgo products sold in the United States found that five were contaminated or low in key compounds. 12. RESEARCH: Long -term outcomes -- benefits and liabilities from continuing treatment with ginkgo and comparative assessment with other drugs -- require furt her investigation, as do the systematic tracking, reporting and quantification of adverse effects. 1 \"Dietary Supplements and Natural Products as Psychotherapeutic Agents,\" by Adriane Fugh -Berman, M.D. (of Georgetown Medical School) and Jerry M.

It is a folk remedy for anxiety and sadness. Inositol has been shown in very small studies to be helpful for depression and panic disorder, and promising for treatment of obsessive -compulsive disorder, eating disorders and bipolar disorder. Research has n ot yet shown any adjunctive benefit when inositol is used with psychotropic drugs. Inositol is a part of our diet, and supplementation seems benign. The risk is minimal. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS Depression and Panic Disorder All four sources that discuss it support use of inositol for depression and panic disorder. Writing in Mischoulon and Rosenbaum's compendium, Belmaker and Levine propose inositol as a stand -alone supplement for depression and panic disorder rather than as a complement for other psycho tropic drugs, noting responses in the same people and no proven additional benefit from using both drugs in combination. But in a 2011 analysis that included Mischoulon as a participant, Iovieno et al . summarize the evidence as \"conflicting.\" Adjunctive us e of inositol remains to be investigated. Other Mental Health Conditions Though promising, due to study design issues inositol has not yet been established as a treatment for obsessive -compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders. 120 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Belmake r and Levine found inositol ineffective in treating: schizophrenia, dementia, electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) -induced memory impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism. DRU G INTERACTIONS AND SIDE EFFECTS There have been no documented cases of drug interactions in studies where inositol was co - administered with FDA -approved medications. Gastrointestinal side effects may be a problem for some people, but i nositol is generally well tolerated and appears to have a favorable safety profile. There is no special concern in pregnancy, lactation or child use. However, there have been case reports of inositol -induced mania in people with bipolar disorder. It is uncertain how significant this effect would be if inositol were in wide r use as a supplement. People with bipolar disorder should exercise appropriate caution, including consideration of using a mood stabilizer while using inositol. CONCLUSION Inositol is a very promising treatment for depression and panic disorder. It is p romising for bipolar disorder, anxiety, obsession, compulsion, eating disorders, hostility, sadness, tension and fatigue. It is quite safe. Adjunctive use may not benefit but will not hurt. People with bipolar disorder should exercise greater caution. 121 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents OUTLINE EFFICACY: DEPRESSIONAND PANIC DISORDER ADJUNCTIVE USE WITH SSRIS MAY SUGGESTED BUT OBSESSIVE -COMPULSIVE D ISORDER SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USERS: EATING DISORDERS DISPROVEN USES DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS DOSAGE RESEARCH 1. Inositol is a sugar alcohol and a structural isomer of glucose. It is often sold as a dietary supplement in combination with other nutraceuticals. Inositol is present in a variety of foods, particularly beans, grains, nuts, and many fruits. The average adult human consumes about 1 g per day of inositol. Inositol is classified as a member of the vitamin B family, specifically vitamin B8. 2. EFFICACY : DEPRESSION AND PANIC DISORDER: Inositol monotherapy has been shown in very small studies to be helpful for depression and panic disorder: Brown et al. report 1995 and 1996 studies in which inositol was found to function better than placebo in alleviating s ymptoms of depression , panic disorder .1 Brown et al. consider inositol to be a \"third -line augmentation\" because of the gastrointestinal side effects. Brown et al. II (through Akhondzadeh, Gerbard, P.L. and Brown, R.P.) confirm evidence for the use of in ositol as an adjunctive treatment for depression and panic disorder.2 122 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Lake and Spiegel note that people with unipolar and bipolar depression have \"markedly low levels\" of inositol. They assert that, \"many small well -designed studies have provided promising evidence to support inositol's therapeutic efficacy in the same spectrum of psychiatric disorders that respond to SSRIs, including depression, panic disorder, and obsessive -compulsive disorder.\"3 As their principal source, they cite Levine's 1997 review o f 8 controlled studies, which is augmented by his discussion in Mischoulon and Rosenbaum. Although none of the other originally consulted sources even mentions inositol, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum dedicate an entire chapter to it, authored by Robert H. Belm aker and Joseph Levine ,4 who describe their investigation of the use of inositol to treat a range of psychiatric disorders, including small studies of depression (alone and in combination with other antidepressant drugs), panic disorder, obsessive -compulsi ve disorder, bulimia and binge eating .5 The depression study is the most robust, but the panic disorder results are also significant. The remaining observations are promising. In the 1995 Levine et al. depression study,6 treatment with inositol resulted i n significantly greater improvement in HAM -D scores at four weeks compared to placebo, 33% improvement with inositol vs. 12% with placebo. (p=.04). The significance of this result is limited by the size of the study (27 subjects) and the four - week duration .7 There were no significant results at two weeks. The 2006 Nierenberg, et al. depression study was more convincing, comparing HAM -D scores with randomized administration of lamotrigine (Lamictal, an anti -seizure medication), resperidone (Risperdal), as a ctive placebo, and inositol. The rate of recovery was 23.8% with lamotrigine, 17.4% with inositol, and 4.6% , a double -blind, random -order, crossover study of panic disorder showed a gre ater reduction in the number of panic attacks with inositol in the first week, and similar results over the nine -week course. Attacks fell from ten to six on placebo and from ten to three and a half on inositol. Ten of 21 subjects responded to inositol, 3 to placebo.9 10 123 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents ADJUNCTIVE USE WITH SSRIS MAY BE INEFFECTIVE. Studies using inositol as an adjunctive treatment with SSRIs have not shown any therapeutic benefit.11 Belmaker and Levine thus propose inositol as a stand -alone supplement rather than as a comp lement for SSRIs, noting responses in the same people, equal efficacy, and no additional benefit from using both drugs in combination . But in a 2011 analysis that included Mischoulon as a participant, Iovieno et al .12 summarize the evidence as \"conflicting :\" There are six published clinical trials of inositol for outpatient treatment of depression , of which five were placebo -controlled. Only the 1995 Levine et al . study used inositol as monotherapy; the others augmented conventional antidepressants and moo d stabilizers with inositol. Inositol outperformed placebo in three of the five controlled studies , but all sample sizes were small, and statistical significance was reached in only one study. 3. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: OBSESSIVE -COMPULSIVE DISORDER: Brown et al, Brown et al II and Lake and Spiegel all find evidence of the efficacy of inositol in treating obsessive -compulsive disorder. The obsessive -compulsive study used a crossover design that makes it hard to evaluate, since there is a delay in the eff ects of inositol supplementation. Thus, Belmaker and Levine did not accept it. But the use of inositol in OCD is certainly promising. 4. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: BIPOLAR DISORDER: Brown et al. II find evidence that inositol can be effective in treating b ipolar disorder. Belmaker and Levine agree that the studies cited by Brown et al. suggest that a large, well -controlled study might show that inositol could be effective in treating bipolar disorder, but they caution that the results so far are not signifi cant. A 1996 study by Levine et al. reported three cases of possible inositol -induced hypomania. 5. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: EATING DISORDERS: Brown et al. II and Lake and Spiegel accepted the inositol monotherapy used by Gelber et al. (2001) for previ ously 124 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents unresponsive bulimia subjects, producing complete remission of symptoms for six months. The obsessive -compulsive disorder and eating disorder studies all used a crossover design that makes them hard to evaluate, since there is a delay in the effects of inositol supplementation. Thus, Belmaker and Levine did not accept them. But they are certainly promising. 6. DISPROVEN USES: Belmaker and Levine also investigated use of inositol for schizophrenia, dementia, electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) -induced memo ry impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism. Inositol proved ineffective in these studies. 7. Finally, Belmaker and Levine tested the effects of inositol in \"normal\" people . Eleven volunteers were given inositol or placebo in a double -blind, randomized, crossover design. Inositol was found to reduce depression, hostility, tension and fatigue compared with placebo over six hours. \"These results are consistent with use of inositol as a folk remedy for anxiety and sadness .\"13 8. DRUG INTERACTIONS : According to Iovieno et al., there have been no documented cases of drug -drug interactions in studies where inositol was co -administered with FDA -approved medications. 9. SIDE EFFECTS: Brown et al. describe gastrointestinal side effects that ca n be severe, including diarrhea and flatulence. Belmaker and Levine and Lake and Spiegel both characterize the symptoms as \"mild.\" Iovien o et al . round out the picture: Inositol is generally well tolerated and appears to have a favorable safety profile. Si de effects reported in the reviewed clinical trials, at doses of inositol ranging from 6 to 25 g per day, include mild incr eases in plasma glucose, flatus, nausea, sleepiness, insomnia, dizziness and headache. However, there have been case reports of inosi tol-induced mania in bipolar depressed patients . It is uncertain how significant this effect would be if inositol were in 125 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents wider use as a supplement. People with bipolar disorder should exercise appropriate caution, including consideration of a mood stabili zer while using inositol. There are no studies or cautions concerning use of inositol in breast -feeding women or in children, but Lake and Spiegel caution that inositol may cause uterine contractions , ruling out its use in pregnant women. 10. DOSAGE: Brown et al. report dosages of 12-20 g per day. Belmaker and Levine and Lake and Spiegel both used a dose of 12-18 g per day. This is 10 - 18 times the average daily intake of 1 g per day. 11. RESEARCH: Long -term outcomes -- benefits and liabilities from continuing tr eatment with inositol and comparative assessment with other drugs -- require further investigation, as do the systematic tracking, reporting and quantification of adverse effects. 1 How to Us e Herbs, Nutrients & Yoga in Mental Health Care, by Richard P.

Kava is generally safe for short -term use but can in rare cases cause catastrophic damage to the liver. Thus, its use is very controversial, and the sources are split four to three on whether it should ever be recommended. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS Seven sources confirm the beneficial uses of kava as a mild intoxicant and a nalgesic, and for treatment of generalized anxiety, depression, stress, tension, agitation, agoraphobia, specific other phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, menopausal symptoms and insomnia. But Brown et al . caution that the benefits are \"modest,\" and all sources caution about the danger of liver damage. There is no proof that kava is effective for treatment of severe anxiety. No published studies have yet tested kava's efficacy for panic disorders. Kava has not been found effective f or adjunctive use, should not be used with MAOIs, and should only be used with tricyclics or SSRIs after careful coordination with the prescribing physician. DRUG INTERACTIONS Kava has the potential to interact with several drugs and medications. It is vit ally important to discuss kava use with a ny prescribing physician. Alcohol, other sedatives, muscle relaxants, dopamine, haloperidol, acetaminophen, and benzodiazepines. Taking kava with alcohol, other sedatives, or muscle relaxants can result in additive effects up to and including coma. Kava may interact with several drugs, including drugs 128 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents used for Parkinson's disease and benzodiazepines used for anxiety. Alcohol or acetaminophen (Tylenol), which may injure the liver, should never be used with kava. Kava may interfere with the effects of dopamine and drugs that are similar to dopamine and may worsen the neurological side effects of drugs that block dopamine, such as haloperidol (Haldol). Psychotropics and anesthesia . to monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and may be additive to used with MAOIs. Adjunctive use with oth er psychotropic drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs, has not been tested, but should not be attempted without careful coordination with the prescribing physician. Kava may cause excessive drowsiness when taken with SSRI antidepressant drug s such as fluoxitine or sertraline. Kava may also cause anesthesia to last longer and use should be carefully coordinated with the prescribing physician or anesthesiologist. Anti -cancer and birth control drugs . Kava may also interact with anti -cancer and b irth control drugs. SIDE EFFECTS CAUTION : LIVER TOXICITY: Reports from health authorities in Germany, Switzerland, France, Canada, and the United Kingdom have linked kava use to at least 30 cases of liver toxicity, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liv er failure. Kava is banned in Germany, Canada and Switzerland . The U.S. FDA issued a consumer advisory in 2002, which is still in effect. The FDA cautions: Persons who have liver disease or liver problems, or persons who are taking drug products that can a ffect the liver, should consult a physician before using kava -containing supplements. Of the consulted sources, Consumer Reports is the most directive: Based on the 2002 FDA warning, kava is one of 12 supplements that Consumer Reports advises that you sho uld avoid. Brown et al. also do not recommend kava, and Fugh -Berman no longer recommends it, because 129 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents of the catastrophic liver damage associated with its use in the cases noted by the FDA. Four sources still recommend careful use of kava. Lake and Spiegel, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum, the Natural Standard , and Weil counsel that kava should be avoided in individuals with a history of liver disease or alcohol use, and in those who are taking concurrent medications with potential liver toxicity. Mischoulon and Ro senbaum conclude: \"Kava should be prescribed and used with great caution.\" Use of kava is not recommended to exceed three months. More research pinpointing risk factors could modify these recommendations, since liver toxicity appears to be extremely rare, and bad experience with other anxiolytics could prompt a trial of kava if the risk factors appear to be low, with proper medical supervision. Pregnancy, lactation or child use would appear not to impose a separate challenge. CONCLUSION Caution . The risk o f liver damage is substantial and may be irreversible, even though it appears to be rare. 130 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents OUTLINE EFFICACY: MILD ANXIETY AND STRESS SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: ANXIETY, AND TO IMPRO VE COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND POSITIVE AFFECT IN ANXIOUS SUBJECTS, INSOMNIA, AND PANIC DISORDERS DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS DOSAGE CAUTION RESEARCH 1. Kava , Piper methysticum, is native to the islands of the South Pacific and is a member of the pepper family. Kava has been used as a ceremonial beverage in the South Pacific for centu ries. Common names include kava, kava kava, awa, and kava pepper. The root and rhizome (underground stem) of kava are used to prepare beverages, extracts, capsules, tablets, and topical solutions. 2. Kava has been used to help people fall asleep and fight fa tigue, as well as to treat asthma and urinary tract infections. Topically, kava has been used as a numbing agent. Today, kava is used primarily for anxiety, insomnia, and menopausal symptoms. 3. EFFICACY: MILD ANXIETY AND STRESS: Kava has been shown in more than a dozen placebo -controlled studies to be effective with good tolerability for treatment of mild anxiety and stress. Six sources confirm the beneficial uses of kava as a mild intoxicant and analgesic, but Brown et al . caution that the benefits are \"mo dest,\" and all sources caution about the danger of liver damage/ failure, which can cause death. Fugh -Berman, Brown et al. and Consumer Reports advocate against the use of kava. 131 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Writing prior to the FDA warning , Fugh -Berman and Cott cited seven studies of kava, demonstrating its beneficial effects on anxiety and stress, and emphasizing the German health system's approval of its use for that purpose, since withdrawn because of the concern about liver toxicity. Fugh -Berman has withdrawn her recommendation as well. After citing conflicting meta -analyses by Pittler & Ernst (2000) and Connor, Payne & Davidson (2006), Brown et al. conclude that: \" Kava has modest benefits in short -term studies of mild anxiety. [But]Considering the risks of intoxication, the risk of abuse, and rarely severe adverse effects, the authors do not recommend kava, until more compelling data on safety and efficacy become available .\"1 Brown et al . II concur. Thus, as of 2013 , adequate data are not available to show safety and efficacy. Lake and Spiegel (through Lee, Yee & Naing) confirmed moderate efficacy in the treatment of [mild] anxiety , primarily based on Pittler and Ernst's two meta -analyses, and added that the reports of liver toxicity, though severe, remain very rare (2 in 250 millio n doses, and both using large dosages), and benzodiazepines have a far higher rate of adverse event reports. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum2 give a more comprehensive critique of the kava studies, all but two of which involved double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized clinical trials using a passive placebo. Only two reported studies compared kava to an active therapy. Kava was shown in \"more than a dozen\" passive placebo studies to be effective with good tolerability for treatment of \"generalized anxiety, t ension, agitation, agoraphobia, specific [other] phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, and insomnia .\"3 These studies used sample sizes of between 20 and 141 people, for a duration of four to eight weeks (although some studies went on for three to six months), at a dosage of 150 to 400 mg. per day. The studies that have compared kava with standard anxiolytics and antidepressants in the treatment of anxiety showed that kava had equivalent effects dosages.4 132 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Weil lauds kava as: \" an excellent anti -anxiety remedy, shown in controlled human trials to be as effective as benzodiazepine drugs .\"5 Consumer Repo rts listed kava as one of \"12 supplements you should avoid ,\" in its September, 2010 issue. The reasons given were: \"Possibly unsafe. The FDA issued a warning to consumers in March 2002. Banned in Germany, Canada and Switzerland.\" There are no studies addr essing the question of safety in pregnancy or breast feeding, and no studies of children, and for this reason, kava is not recommended for use in pregnant or lactating women or in children. Because of the danger of bleeding, use during pregnancy is strongl y discouraged. 4. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: ANXIETY, AND TO IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND POSITIVE AFFECT IN ANXIOUS SUBJECTS, INSOMNIA, PANIC DISORDERS: The sources recommend kava as a promising but unproven CAM treatment for generalized anxiety, stres s, tension, agitation, agoraphobia, specific other phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, menopausal symptoms and insomnia, and to improve cognitive function and positive affect in anxious subjects. Anxiety, insomnia and panic disorder s would all be studied as promising practices if kava were not implicated in a few catastrophic cases of liver toxicity. But these studies are unlikely to proceed. The sources all agree that there is no proof that kava is effective in treatment of severe anxiety . Most of the studies are limited by small samples, short duration of treatment, and a lack of rigorous diagnostic criteria. Moreover, no published studies have yet tested kava's efficacy for panic disorders. Nonetheless, the Natural Standard gives an \"A\" rating for the use of kava for anxiety, affirming that there is \"strong scientific evidence for this use.\" The write -up is more cautious, stating only that the clinical studies have found \"at least moderate benefit\" for the treatment of anxiety. The Natural Standard affirms the studies finding the efficacy of kava to be similar to benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam (Valium) or the 133 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents anxiolytic drug buspirone (Buspar). However, concerns about potential liver toxicity are emphasized. The Natural Stand ard rates use of kava for insomnia and stress \"C,\" \"unclear scientific evidence for this use.\" 5. DRUG INTERACTIONS : 1. Taking kava with alcohol, other sedatives, or muscle relaxants can result in additive effects up to and including coma. Kava may interact wi th several drugs, including drugs used for Parkinson's disease and benzodiazepines used for anxiety. Alcohol or acetaminophen (Tylenol), which may injure the liver, are strongly contraindicated for use with kava. Kava may interfere with the effects of dopa mine and drugs that are similar to dopamine and may worsen the neurological side effects of drugs that block dopamine such as haloperidol (Haldol). 2. Kava may have chemical properties similar to monoamine oxidase inhibitors (\"MAOIs\"), and may be additive to used with MAOIs. Adjunctive use with other psychotropic drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants and SSRI s, has not been tested, but should not be attempted without careful coordination with the prescribing physician. Kava may cause excessive drowsiness when taken with SSRI antidepressant drugs such as fluoxitine or sertraline. Kava may also cause anesthesia to last longer and use should be carefully coordinated with the prescribing physician or anesthesiologist. 3. Laboratory tests suggest a danger of bleeding, but this has not yet been found in human subjects. Still, Natural Standard cautions against using anti coagulants or antiplatelets with kava. This includes (Plavix). 4. Since kava has diuretic properties, it may have an additive effect when taken with diuretic drugs such as furosemide or with ACE inhibitor s such as benazopril or captopril. The Natural Standard specifically cautions avoidance of kava, in patients with Parkinson's disease or those with a \"history of medication -induced extrapyramidal 134 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents effects.\" Busperone and opipramol may also have additive eff ects taken with kava, or with opioid like oxycodone and propoxyphene or herbs like valerian. Kava may also interact with anti -cancer and birth control drugs . 6. SIDE EFFECTS: Fugh -Berman and Cott cited mild gastrointestinal complaints or al lergic skin reactions (incidence, 1.5%) as the most common effects. Chronic use of kava up to 100 times the therapeutic dose results in an ichthyosiform eruption (yellowed skin) known as kava dermopathy, which is often accompanied by eye irritation. Abstai ning from kava results in complete resolution of symptoms. According to Brown et al ., post marketing studies have revealed a 1.5% to 2.3% incidence of side effects from kava, primarily gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, headache, and light sensiti vity. Less common side effects include restlessness, drowsiness, lack of energy, and tremor. In four cases, kava was associated with dyskinesias or worsening Parkinsonian symptoms. According to Mischoulon and Rosenbaum, the most common side effects of kav a use are gastrointestinal upset, allergic skin reactions, headaches and dizziness. Liver toxicity has been noted with prolonged aboriginal use as well as in the cases cited by the FDA. There are reports of adverse interactions with benzodiazepines6 and al cohol. According to Mischoulon and Rosenbaum, the more serious toxic reactions have been associated with high doses (over 300 g. per week, 43 g. per day - 43,000 mg per day) or prolonged use of kava, and use of kava without physician supervision. Lake and Spiegel (Lee, Yee and Naing) add antiplatelet activity and apathy with long - term use. The Natural Standard relates the history, that kava had generally been thought to be \"safe in otherwise healthy people not taking any other drugs, herbs or supplements, over short periods of time (1 to 2 months), and at recommended doses.\" However, the facts recited in the FDA release have required a change in the Natural Standard 's stance, concluding that, \" kava should be used only under the supervision of a qualified 135 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents healthcare professional, should never be used above recommended doses, and should be avoided by people with liver problems and by those taking drugs that affect the liver .\" Reports from health authorities in Germany, Switzerland, France, Canada, and the Unit ed Kingdom have linked kava use to at least 30 cases of liver toxicity, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Kava is banned in Germany, Canada and Switzerland. The US FDA issued a consumer advisory in 2002, which is still in effect. The FDA c autions: Persons who have liver disease or liver problems, or persons who are taking drug products that can affect the liver, should consult a physician before using kava -containing supplements. In view of the evidence of liver toxicity, four of the seven sources consulted for this section of this outline, Lake and Spiegel, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum, the Natural Standard , and Weil, counsel that kava should be avoided in individuals with a history of liver disease or alcohol use, and in those who are taking concurrent medications with potential liver toxicity. Anyone who uses kava should do so under physician supervision, which should include regular monitoring of liver function tests, particularly ALT, GGT and ALP. If any abnormalities are found, then kava s hould be discontinued immediately and liver enzymes should be retested in about two weeks, by which time they should return to normal. The other three sources, Fugh -Berman, Brown et al . and Consumer Reports, dissent and counsel complete avoidance of kava. If you use kava without medical consultation, get help right away if you start feeling bad. FDA urges consumers and their health care professionals to report any cases of liver and other injuries that may be related to the use of kava -containing dietary supplements. Adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplements should be reported as soon as possible to FDA's MedWatch program by calling their toll -free number (1 -800-332-1088) or through the Internet . Other side effects include dystonia (abnormal muscle spasm or involuntary muscle movements), gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, headache, light sensitivity and 136 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents scaly, yellowed skin, blood abnormalities, apathy, kidney damag e, seizures, psychotic syndromes, and increased blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). Blood in the urine has also been reported. Less common side effects include restlessness, drowsiness, lack of energy, and tremor. In four cases, kava was associated with dyskinesias or worsening Parkinsonian symptoms. Feelings of sedation (drowsiness) are inherent in the use of kava. The Natural Standard adds: eye irritation, ECG abnormalities, shortness of breath, bleeding, irritation in the layers around the brain and spinal cord, urinary retention, skin lesions, enhanced or decreased cognitive performance, anorexia, sleeplessness, abnormal sensations called paresthesias, vomiting, and dangerously high blood pressure. People should use great care in operating heavy machinery while taking kava because the herb has been reported to cause drowsiness. 7. DOSAGE: A dose -finding study using 150 to 300 mg. per day found that improvement was more \"robust\" with higher doses. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum report that the re is no consensus on the optimal daily dose, and lack of a standardized extract makes comparison impossible. But Mischoulon and Rosenbaum cite dosages of 150 to 300 or 400 mg. per day . Weil recommends 100 to 200 mg two or three times a day, as needed ( 300-600 mg per day). Lake and Spiegel agree on three doses of 100 mg per day. The more serious toxic reactions have been associated with high doses or prolonged use of kava, and use of kava without physician supervision. 8. CAUTION: Duration of use of kava is not recommended to exceed three months . Mischoulon and Rosenbaum conclude that: \" Kava should be prescribed and used with great caution .\"7 9. RESEARCH: More research pinpointing risk factors could modify these recommendations, since liver toxicity appears to be extremely rare, and bad experience with other anxiolytics 137 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents could prompt a trial of kava if the risk factors appear to be low, with proper medical supervision. 1 How to Use Herbs, Nutrients & Yoga in Mental Health Care, by Richard P.

Although the U. S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) questions the evidence, the five sources that deal with melatonin all recommend it for: jet lag and shift work adjustment, Melatoni n is a promising treatment for other sleep disorders, especially: sleep latency (delay in falling asleep) in older people. insomnia in the elderly, sleep disturbances in children with neuro -psychiatric disorders, and sleep enhancement in healthy people However, some of the evidence is tentative, and much more study is needed. Uses of melatonin to treat insomnia and maintain cognitive capacity (neuroprotection) are particularly interesting but remain unresolved. Other suggested but unproven uses include : circadian sleep disorders [cyclical melatonin deficiency] dealing with the side effects of treatment for schizophrenia, particularly tardive dyskinesia and weight gain, benzodiazepine withdrawal, high -altitude adjustment, 139 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents insomnia in dementia, insomni a in people with autism, \"sundowning\"/sleep pattern adjustment, rapid eye movement behavior disorder, seasonal affective disorder, drug withdrawal syndrome, major depression, and adjunctive use. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS Melatonin is a promising t reatment for jet lag and many mild to moderate sleep disorders. All other potential uses remain to be studied. Risks appear manageable, but caution is appropriate since melatonin is commonly over consumed , and, absent testing, people should \"work up\" to a therapeutic dose. DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interactions with melatonin have not been sufficiently studied, but appear manageable. Alcohol, caffeine and aspirin may affect melatonin levels. Psychotropic drugs that affect norepinephrine or serotonin levels mig ht alter the pattern of melatonin production and that any drugs that might affect the metabolism of melatonin in the liver, such as valproic acid or methoxypsoralen, could affect blood serum levels of melatonin. Consultation with the prescribing physician is essential if any prescription drug is being taken with melatonin. Special care is appropriate for people al, narcotics such as codeine, antidepressants, blood thinning medication such as warfarin (Coumadin), 140 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents methamphetamine, medication for glaucoma. beta blockers, and tranquilizers. SIDE EFFECTS Melatonin is classified by the FDA as \"generally regarded as safe\" in recommended doses for short -term use. The most common side effect is gastric distress. There is controversy about the effect of melatonin on seizure disorders. In the absence of better science, consultation with the health care professional providing care for an existing seizure disorder is essential if considering using melatonin. Mood changes have been reported, both highs and lows, and even psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and paranoia. Persons with major depression or psychotic disorders should consult with the health care professional providing care for the underlying disorder before using melatonin. Given the lack of experimental data concerning melatonin supplementation in children, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum caution that melato nin treatment in children should be used only \"very conservatively,\" when the benefits of melatonin treatment clearly outweigh any possible risks. There are no data concerning use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Overconsumption of melatonin ca n have sig nificant risks. It has been suggested that millions of Americans currently consume melatonin in excessive quantities, elevating their melatonin levels many times over those that occur normally. The notion that uncontrolled use of melatonin is completely sa fe rests on little research and on the common public experience of lack of significant short -term toxic effects. However, disruption of the delicate mechanism of the circadian system is, in and of itself, a significant potential side effect. 141 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Because indiv idual rates of melatonin metabolism vary substantially, with older and smaller people disproportionately affected, adjustment of the dosage is essential to avoid decreased effects in the latter part of the night due to excessive use of \"slow release\" melat onin on the one hand or disturbance of circadian patterns by use of excessive amounts of \"fast release\" melatonin on the other. Over -the-counter melatonin supplements typically contain 3 -5 mg, but studies show that even a relatively low dose of 0.3 mg per day may induce circadian levels of the hormone well in excess of the normal level in people over 50 years old. Thus, before deciding on a therapeutic dose to deal with insomnia, people should consult with a physician to determine the precise amount of supp lementation needed. Absent testing, leading researchers (Mischoulon and Rosenbaum) recommend that people \"work up\" to a therapeutic level, beginning with 0.1 to 0.2 mg per day. JET LAG The sources differ in their prescription for jet lag, with Mischoulon and Rosenbaum's prescription the best reasoned: If melatonin is administered to contract the effect of eastward - travel jet lag, a dose of 0.1 to 0.3 mg at the local bedtime following the flight is recommended. Such treatment will restore the deficit in mel atonin that the traveler will experience due to the advance of bedtime at the destination. Following a westward flight, when the day is extended rather than shortened, it would be advisable not to take melatonin at the local bedtime, when the endogenous le vel of the hormone is already increased. However, it might be helpful to take a half dose (e.g., 0.1 mg) immediately following a night or early morning awakening, as is typically experienced in westward flights. In principle, this would facilitate resumpti on of sleep and its maintenance, plus delaying the circadian phase and adjusting to the new location. CONCLUSION Jet lag and sleep problems associated with shift work are the most promising uses, but many other suggested uses remain to be studied. 142 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Melato nin does not have significant toxic effects, but it may interfere with sleep rhythms. Risks appear manageable so long as drug interactions are avoided, but caution is appropriate since melatonin is commonly over consumed , and, absent testing, people shoul d \"work up\" to a therapeutic dose. 143 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents OUTLINE THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY EFFICACY: JET LAG AND SLEEP DISORDERS DELAYED PHASE SLEEP SYNDROME, INSOMNIA IN THE ELDERLY, SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN CHILDREN WITH NEURO -PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, AND SLEEP ENHANCEMENT IN HEALTHY PEOPLE SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: N EUROPROTECTION SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: USES: SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: BENZODIAZEPINE WITHDRAWAL AND HIGH -ALTITUD E ADJUSTMENT SUGGESTED UNPROVEN USES: SLEEP PATTERNS UNPROVEN USES: MAJOR DEPRESSION, SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER, AND DRUG WITHDRAWAL SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: INSOMNIA IN DEMENTIA, INSOMNIA IN PEOPLE WITH AUTISM, RAPID EYE MOVEMENT BEHAVI OR DISORDER, \"SUNDOWNING\"/SLEEP PATTERN ADJUSTMENT SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: ADJUNCTIVE USE THE NATURAL STANDARD DISSENTS DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS DOSAGE 1. Melatonin (N -acetyl -5-methoxytryptamine) is a neurohormone that is primarily produced by the pineal gland, located behind the third v entricle in the brain. In the synthesis of 144 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents melatonin, tryptophan is hydroxylated to 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP), turn is decarboxylated to 5 -hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). Serotonin is converted to produce melatonin. Approximately 90 percent of melatonin is cleared in a single passage through the liver. A small proportion of non-metabolized melatonin is also excreted in the urine. Commercially available melatonin may be isolated from the pineal glands of beef cattle or chemically synthesized. However, there is no standard preparation, making studies very difficult to compare. 2. THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) determined in 2004 that: \" Evidence suggests that melatonin is not effective in treating most primary sleep disorders with short -term use, altho ugh there is some evidence to suggest that melatonin is effective in treating delayed sleep phase syndrome with short -term use. Evidence suggests that melatonin is not effective in treating most secondary sleep disorders with short -term use. No evidence suggests that melatonin is effective in alleviating the sleep disturbance aspect of jet lag and shift -work disorder. Evidence suggests that melatonin is safe with short -term use.\" The AHRQ suggested that the apparent effectiveness of melatonin in alleviating jet lag may not involve alleviation of the sleep disturbance, but rather, alleviation of the daytime fatigue associated with jet lag. 3. EFFICACY: JET LAG AND SLEEP DISORDERS: Dissenting from the AHRQ, all five sources that mention melatonin except the fede ral government (Brown et al ., Mischoulon and Rosenbaum (through Zhdanova, I.V. and Friedman, L.) , the Natural Standard , Berkeley Wellness , the Mayo Clinic and Weil) find melatonin to be effective for jet lag and shift work adjustment, and all except the fe deral government and Berkeley Wellness recommend it for sleep latency (delay in falling asleep), at least in older people. Other uses of melatonin remain controversial, particularly in cognition maintenance and 145 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents treatment of other forms of insomnia, but mel atonin is a promising treatment for many mild to moderate sleep disorders: Brown et al . state that: \"Melatonin is ... beneficial in mild to moderate sleep disorders. Unlike most hypnotics, it does not disturb sleep architecture and does not lead to habituati on. Double -blind randomized placebo -controlled trials show that melatonin improves sleep, reduces sleep onset latency1 and restores sleep efficiency2 in patients with insomnia.\"3 The evidence is \"robust\" concerning the use of melatonin to counteract jet l ag or advance or to deal with shift pattern changes, which Mischoulon and Rosenbaum support. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum counsel that supplementation be administered at the right circadian time, in low light situations, and in therapeutic dosages. The Natura l Standard rates only use of melatonin for jet lag as \"A,\" \"supported by strong scientific evidence,\" stating that despite inconsistent studies, \"overall, the scientific evidence does suggest benefits of melatonin in up to 50% of people who take it for jet lag.\" Although the premise is unstated, this endorsement should be read to include shift work adjustment as well. Berkeley Wellness states that melatonin may be effective to help people whose sleep patterns are disrupted by shift work or jet lag. Like Mi schoulon and Rosenbaum, Berkeley Wellness advises talking to a physician first and assuring that the dosage and timing of melatonin use are appropriate. 4. DELAYED PHASE SLEEP SYNDROME, INSOMNIA IN THE ELDERLY, SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN CHILDREN WITH NEURO -PSYCH IATRIC DISORDERS, AND SLEEP ENHANCEMENT IN HEALTHY PEOPLE Delayed phase sleep syndrome, insomnia in the elderly, sleep disturbances in children with neuro -psychiatric disorders, and sleep enhancement in healthy people are all rated as \"B,\" \"good scientific evidence for this use,\" meaning that there are enough studies of sufficient reliability to make these \"promising practices.\" 146 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Based on the Natural Standard , the 2011 edition of Berkeley Wellness also endorses use of melatonin for insomnia or to promote be tter sleep, but only for occasional short -term use. The Mayo Clinic goes further than most sources in stating flatly that \"melatonin can promote sleep.\" But Mayo recommends using melatonin for occasional jet lag or difficulty in making any other sleep adju stment, not for insomnia, which is the critical area of controversy. Weil is even more positive, speaking for himself, stating that: \"I take [melatonin] most nights both for its effect on sleep and dreaming, and its useful influence on immunity.\"4 5. SUGGES TED BUT UNPROVEN USES --\\NEUROPROTECTION : In addition to sleep disorders, Brown et al. assert that melatonin: \"has numerous neuro and increases the effect of anti -oxidan ts.5 Thus, they suggest that \"melatonin may possibly improve cognitive function to some extent in long -term use, with its strongest effects being preventative.\"6 They add that the relative melatonin deficit associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disea ses might indicate a preventative effect with supplementation. But the single study cited b y Brown,7 while showing Alzheimer's symptom improvement with melatonin supplementation, showed no mental status improvement compared to the placebo group. Brown et al. comment that, \"In elderly patients, including those with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, melatonin in doses of 3 to 9 mg at bedtime can help to improve sleep, mood, memory, and sundowning . It may slow progression of cognitive decline in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. Melatonin may have a role in long term prevention of neuro -degeneration, particularly if it is started at the age of 40 or 45.\"8 Berkeley Wellness makes no mention of use of melatonin for any kind of cognitive function, stat ing that the evidence is conflicting or inconclusive. 6. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES : INSOMNIA: 147 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Brown et al . reviewed 14 controlled trials and determined that melatonin is effective in treating delayed sleep -phase disorder (DSPD), also known as delayed slee p-phase syndrome (DSPS) or delayed sleep -phase type (DSPT), a circadian rhythm sleep disorder affecting the timing of sleep, the peak period o f alertness, the core body temperature rhythm, hormonal and other daily rhythms.9 According t o Brown et al ., melatonin is also useful in treating insomnia in people with autism, epilepsy and developmental disabilities .10 With regard to insomnia, Mayo states that research with older adults has shown a decline in sleep latency (time needed to get to sleep) if melatonin is taken at least a half hour before bedtime. Mayo emphasizes that it is unknown whether melatonin can help them stay asleep, or whether its effects would carry over in younger people. In addition, Mayo cautions that the studies have b een flawed and that little is known of long -term effects of melatonin. Comparison with other insomnia medications is also necessary. 7. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES : SCHIZOPHRENIA: Brown et al. suggest that melatonin is helpful in dealing with the side eff ects of treatment for schizophrenia, particularly tardive dyskinesia and weight gain .11 These studies are small in scale but suggestive, and worth considering until further research is done. Of course, complementary use of melatonin with psychotropic drugs should always be discussed with the prescribing physician due to the usual polypharmacy concerns. However, given the mildness of the side effects of melatonin, such complementary use should be considered if the side effects of psychotropic medication devel op or are feared. The Natural Standard concurs: \"Preliminary reports suggest that melatonin may aid dyskinesia associated of] UNPROVEN USES : BENZODIAZEPINE WITHDRAWAL AND HIGH -ALTITUDE ADJUSTMENT: Brown et al . also recommend melatonin for benzodiazepine withdrawal and high -altitude adaptation .12 Brown et al. state that consumers who experience cognitive 148 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents or memory impairment or daytime drowsiness from benzodiazepine use may respond to mela tonin with fewer adverse effects. 9. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES : SLEEP PATTERNS: Mischoulon and Rosenbaum (through Zhdanova, I.V. and Friedman, L.) conclude, significantly, that changes in melatonin levels are not part of the genesis of age -related insomni a or psychiatric diseases. However, a number of clinical symptoms characteristic of these disorders, such as sleep alterations and anxiety, might benefit from timely melatonin treatment, given the strong \"indirect signs of a close relationship between mela tonin and sleep.... Collectively, the available data on the effects of melatonin on sleep suggest that a nocturnal surge in melatonin production may be an important factor in normal human sleep regulation, and that melatonin deficiency might contribute to an altered sleep pattern .\"13 10. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES : CIRCADIAN SLEEP DISORDERS [CYCLICAL MELATONIN DEFICIENCY] As in her 2001 study (cited by Brown et al .), Zhdanova (writing in Mischoulon and Rosenbaum) asserts fairly weakly that, \"... melatonin MIGHT prov ide a useful tool for improving sleep and mood in those people who suffer from psychiatric disease, circadian sleep disorders [cyclical melatonin deficiency], or insomnia of other origin .\"14 11. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES : MAJOR DEPRESSION, SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER, AND DRUG WITHDRAWAL: Mischoulon and Rosenbaum suggest broadly that, \"the observed effects of melatonin treatment on sleep and mood might be of substantial benefit to patients suffering from a variety of psychiatric disorders that are typically associated with insomnia and anxiety, including major depression, seasonal affective disorder, schizophrenia, or drug withdrawal syndrome.\" 12. INSOMNIA IN DEMENTIA, RAPID EYE MOVEMENT BEHAVIOR DISORDER, INSOMNIA IN PEOPLE WITH AUTISM AND \"SUNDOWNING\" /SLEEP PATTERN ADJUSTMENT According to Brown et al ., melatonin is particularly useful in treating, \"delayed sleep phase syndrome, 149 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents insomnia in dementia, rapid eye movement behavior disorder, insomnia in [people with] autism, and jet lag.\"15 Three studies have docu mented decreased \"sundowning\" (agitation at night) and improvements in mood, memory and sleep in persons with dementia taking melatonin, although the sample sizes have been very small and the studies have been short (under three months).16 13. SUGGESTED BUT U NPROVEN USES : ADJUNCTIVE USE: Many of these suggested uses would be adjunctive to the use of other psychotropic drugs, especially antidepressants. This would require careful monitoring of melatonin levels, since psychotropic drugs that affect norepinephrin e or serotonin levels might alter the pattern of melatonin production. Although no dangerous interaction is known, adjunctive use of melatonin with psychotropics should be coordinated with the prescribing physician . 14. THE NATURAL STANDARD DISSENTS: Other th an jet lag, the uses of melatonin approved by Brown et al. and Mischoulon and Rosenbaum are categorized by the Natural Standard as \"C,\" \"unclear scientific evidence for this use,\" even though in most cases there are studies suggestive of effective use of m elatonin for these conditions. These include Alzheimer's disease (sleep disorders), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepine tapering, bipolar disorder (sleep disturbances), circadian rhythm entraining (in blind persons), depression (sleep disorders), insomnia (of unknown origin in non -elderly persons), sedation, REM sleep behavior disorder, schizophrenia (sleep disorders),shift work adjustment, tardive dyskinesia(despite the comment quoted above), and seasonal affective disorder. 15. DRUG INT ERACTIONS : Drug interactions with melatonin have not been sufficiently studied, and Mischoulon and Rosenbaum's discussion is essentially theoretical. However, they caution against the potential that psychotropic drugs that affect norepinephrine or serotoni n levels might alter the pattern of melatonin production and that any drugs that might affect the 150 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents metabolism of melatonin in the liver, such as valproic acid or methoxypsoralen, could affect serum levels of melatonin. They further caution that melatonin i s likely to modulate the effects of other substances, which requires careful consideration of appropriate dosages if any other drugs or herbs are being used, and may require that Mischoulon and Rosenbaum's lower melatonin dosages be increased. Likewise, ge nerally, the Natural Standard cautions that melatonin may increase drowsiness caused by other drugs, such as zolpidem (Ambien), benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (Ativan) or as phenobarbital, narcotics such as codeine, some antidepressants (unspecified) and alcohol. The Natural Standard cautions generally that since melatonin is broken down (metabolized) by the liver enzymes, drugs that alter the activity of these enzymes may increase or decrease effects of melatonin sup plements. \"Based on preliminary evidence,\" the Natural Standard cautions that melatonin should be avoided in people taking the blood thinning medication warfarin (Coumadin) and possibly by people using other blood thinners (anticoagulants) such as aspirin or heparin if problems become apparent. Since melatonin may cause adverse changes in blood pressure and cholesterol levels, caution is advised to persons on blood pressure or cholesterol medication and persons with or at risk of cardiovascular disease. Ab normal heart rhythms have been reported. It is not clear if or how caffeine affects melatonin supplementation. Caffeine may raise melatonin levels, but its stimulative effects may also alter wake -sleep rhythms. Alcohol consumption seems to alter melatoni n secretion at night. According to the Natural Standard : \"Preliminary reports suggest that melatonin may aid in dyskinesia associated with of] the effects of isoniazid against [tuberculosis].\" On the other hand, melatonin may increase the adverse effects of methamphetamine on the nervous system. 151 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents There is controversy concerning the effects of melatonin on inter -ocular pressure, and thus on persons taking medication for glaucoma. The Natural Standard urges monitoring by the physician prescribing the medication. Berkeley Wellness warns that aspirin, beta blockers, and tranquilizers can affect melatonin levels. Like benzodiazepines (such as diazepam ( Valium) or triazolam (Halcion)), often described as slee ping pills, melatonin can produce a \"hangover\" and drowsiness the next day. Persons taking benzodiazepines should beware of the potential for an additive effect. 16. SIDE EFFECTS : Melatonin is classified by the FDA as \"generally regarded as safe\" in recommende d doses for short -term use. The AHRQ confirms that evidence suggests that melatonin is safe with short -term use. Mild gastrointestinal distress commonly occurs , including nausea, vomiting or cramping. Melatonin has been linked to a case of autoimmune hepat itis and with triggering Crohn's disease symptoms. Brown et al . list fatigue, dizziness, headache, and irritability as \"infrequent and usually mild\" side effects of melatonin supplementation . Berkeley Wellness warns that \"chronic\" (long -term) use of melat onin supplements may suppress the body's own melatonin production and can interact with other hormones. Therefore, Berkeley says, pregnant women and children should never take melatonin. Brown et al. state that consumers who experience cognitive or memory impairment or daytime drowsiness from benzodiazepine s may respond to melatonin with fewer adverse effects. \"Fortunately,\" Weil adds, \" one does not develop tolerance to melatonin as with other sleep aids, and it rarely has negative side effects .\"17 Commonl y reported side effects include mild fatigue, dizziness, headache, irritability, and sleepiness, although the Natural Standard acknowledges that these may be caused more by the jet lag than by the melatonin. Fatigue can be more pronounced with 152 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents morning use or high doses, and irregular wake -sleep cycles, disorientation, vision, sleepwalking, vivid dreams, and nightmares are all possible side effects. Difficulties with walking and balance may occur following overdose. Case reports raise concerns about risks of blood clotting abnormalities, increased risk of seizure, and disorientation with overdose. Berkeley Wellness warns that \"chronic\" (long -term) use of melatonin supplements may suppress the body's own melatonin production and can interact with other hormon es. Therefore, pregnant women and children should never take melatonin. Berkeley also lists high blood sugar, breast swelling in men, decreased sperm count, gastrointestinal irritation, sleepwalking, the morning hangover effect (drowsiness in the morning) and dizziness as potential side effects. For some people, melatonin may cause dozing off but not staying asleep. There is controversy about the effect of melatonin on seizure disorders . In the absence of better science, consultation with the health care pr ofessional providing care for the seizure disorder is essential while using melatonin. Mood changes have been reported, both highs and lows (depression), and even psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and paranoia. Persons with severe depression or psy chotic disorders should consult with the health care professional providing care for the underlying disorder before using melatonin. Since melatonin may cause adverse changes in blood pressure and cholesterol levels, caution is advised to persons with or at risk of cardiovascular disease. Abnormal heart rhythms have been reported. Melatonin may increase blood sugar levels for people with type 1 diabetes and may lower them in type 2 diabetes. Anyone with diabetes should monitor blood sugar levels while us ing melatonin. Hormonal effects are to be expected with the use of an estrogen -like hormone. These effects include decreases or increases in levels of luteinizing hormone, progesterone, estradiol, thyroid hormone, growth hormone, prolactin, cortisol, oxyt ocin, and 153 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents vasopressin. Increased breast size and decreased sperm count and motility have been reported in men. Given the lack of experimental data concerning melatonin supplementation in children, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum caution that melatonin treatment i n children should be used only \"very conservatively,\" when the benefits of melatonin treatment clearly outweigh any possible risks. There are no data concerning use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The safety of high -dose or long -term melatonin use have not been evaluated. Doses above 50 mg per day may have long -term effects on testosterone or prolactin levels. Thus, patients on long -term daily melatonin should be monitored for possible adverse effects. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum caution that millions of Am ericans currently consume melatonin in quantities that elevate their hormone levels \"manyfold\" over those that occur normally. The notion that uncontrolled use of melatonin is completely safe rests on little research and on the common public experience of lack of significant short - term toxic effects. Long -term clinical and experimental studies are needed to address this important question, since disruption of the \"delicate mechanism\" of the circadian system is, in and of itself, a significant potential side effect. 17. CIRCADIAN PATTERNS AND DOSAGE: Over -the-counter melatonin supplements typically contain 3 -5 mg, but Mischoulon and Rosenbaum caution that even a relatively low dose of 0.3 mg per day may induce circadian levels of the hormone in people over 50 y ears old well in excess of the normal level. Other potential effects of large doses of melatonin include lowering of body temperature, reflecting changes in either energy metabolism or temperature regulation, and unwanted modifications in human reproductiv e function. Finally, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum caution that it is important to avoid bright light exposure during melatonin treatment, since even regular room light can rapidly suppress melatonin production. In addition, exposure to bright light could produ ce an adverse effect, since melatonin has been reported to increase photoreceptor susceptibility. 154 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents 18. DOSAGE: Melatonin is available in both fast -release and sustained -release forms. Brown et al. recommend dosages between 2-6 total mg per day (50% fast -acting and 50% slow acting) at bedtime, up to 9 mg per day maximum , which they state usually induces drowsiness. They caution against doses of over 50 mg per day. For jet lag, they recommend 5 -10 mg of fast -release melatonin just prior to departure. The Natura l Standard notes dosages of 0.5 to 50 mg per day - a wide range -- in the studies, without any recommendation, or up to 20 mg per day by intramuscular injection. Weil recommends 2.5 mg per day , using sublingual tablets. Fugh -Berman warns that these are hig h doses, stating that as little as 0.1 -0.3 mg may work for sleep . Mischoulon and Rosenbaum agree. See below. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum recommend using preparations that use solid dilutants such as lactose or micro cellulose in addition to preparations that use only oil, which is absorbed faster but does not stay on the blood as long, since such \"fast -release\" melatonin preparations may not sustain adequate serum levels throughout the night. Thus, as recommended by Brown et al ., a combined dosage may be best , but Mischoulon and Rosenbaum caution that individual rates of melatonin metabolism very substantially, that older and smaller people are disproportionately affected, and that adjustment of the dosage is essential to avoid decreased effects in the latter part of the night due to excessive use of \"slow release\" melatonin on the one hand or disturbance of circadian patterns by use of excessive amounts of \"fast release\" melatonin on the other. Since human bodies cannot get meaningful amounts of melatonin from food, but manufacture it within the body, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum postulate that the aim should be to mimic normal melatonin levels . This is best done by measuring melatonin levels in the blood, saliva, or urine in order and supplementing according to th e precise amount of the deficiency found . Mischoulon and Rosenbaum caution that 155 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents even a relatively low dose of 0.3 mg per day may induce circadian levels of the hormone in people over 50 years old well in excess of the normal level. Thus, before deciding on a therapeutic dose to deal with insomnia, people should consult with a physician to determine the precise amount of supplementation needed. Absent testing, people should \"work up\" to a therapeutic level, beginning with 0.1 to 0.2 mg. Note that these recom mended dosages follow Fugh -Berman's recommendation and are less than those recommended by Brown et al and Weil. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum advise that if melatonin is taken to improve nighttime sleep, it should be taken about 30 minutes before bedtime to mi nimize the possibility of an undesired circadian phase shift. If melatonin is administered to contract the effect of eastward -travel jet lag, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum recommend a dose of 0.1 to 0.3 mg at the local bedtime following the flight. Such treatm ent will restore the deficit in melatonin that the traveler will experience due to the advance of bedtime at the destination. Following a westward flight, when the day is extended rather than shortened, it would be advisable not to take melatonin at the lo cal bedtime, when the endogenous level of the hormone is already increased. However, it might be helpful to take a half dose (e.g., 0.1 mg) immediately following a night or early morning awakening, as is typically experienced in westward flights. In princi ple, this would facilitate resumption of sleep and its maintenance, plus delaying the circadian phase and adjusting to the new location. The Natural Standard differs from Mischoulon and Rosenbaum in recommending that the melatonin be initiated before trave l (at the destination bedtime) rather than on arrival and recommending that supplementation continue for \"several days.\" Quick - release is recommended as \"more effective\" than slow -release melatonin, but without the elaboration given by Brown et al. and Mis choulon and Rosenbaum . For jet lag, the Mayo Clinic recommends use of melatonin on the day of travel, and continuing for several days. No timing or dosage is specified. 156 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents 19. RESEARCH: Long -term outcomes -- benefits and liabilities from continuing treatment wit h melatonin and comparative assessment with other drugs -- require further investigation, as do the systematic tracking, reporting and quantification of adverse effects. Sleep laboratory studies are essential to understanding melatonin's effect on quality of sleep. 1 Kayumov, L., Brown, G. , Jindal, R., Buttoo, K., & C.

WHAT WE KNOW Experts agree: Include omega -3s in your heart -healthy diet. http://examine.com/supp lements/Fish+Oil/#summary1 -0 And it may help your mind as well. The risk is minimal. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS Depression The prevalence of depression in a society is inversely related to that society's consumption of fish: the more that people eat fis h, the healthier the population, both physically and mentally. But studies are split when it comes to proving a link between an individual's consumption of omega -3s and lowered depression. All of the eight sources that discuss omega -3s acknowledge that th ere is promising evidence for omega -3s in the treatment of depression. Five of those studies recommend omega -3 supplementation for depression. Three studies do not recommend it, saying that the evidence is not conclusive enough. Bipolar Disorder and Adjunc tive Use 158 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents The same five sources state that omega -3s may have a mood stabilizing effect and help with short -term symptoms of bipolar disorder, and may be used as an adjunct to psychotropic medications, particularly antidepressants. Other Mental Health Condi tions Experts are researching potential effects of omega -3s on: cognitive impairment/dementia, perinatal and postpartum depression, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), seasonal affective dis order, violent and impulsive behavior, dyslexia, self-harm, and childhood mood disorders. The evidence is slim, but these are additional reasons to consider a heart -healthy diet rich in omega -3s. SIDE EFFECTS & DRUG INTERACTIONS Side Effects May affe ct blood sugar levels (if concerned, check with your doctor) May worsen low -density lipoprotein (LDL) aka \"bad\" cholesterol May trigger fish allergy May elevate levels of Vitamins A and D (in commercial supplements only) May cause hypervitamonosis A in rar e cases when fish liver oil is used in high doses. Side effects and drug interactions are the same as eating fish, and appear minimal. The most 159 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents likely effect is indigestion, best addressed by taking omega -3s (or fish) with other food and, when taking suppl ements, taking smaller doses at different times of day rather than taking it all at once. Given the side effects and the likely benefits, the use of omega -3s in pregnancy and breastfeeding and in young children seem s reasonable. Drug Interactions/Contamina nts Anticoagulants, like aspirin, warfarin, or heparin may interact to increase the risk of bleeding, though clinical evidence does not confirm this. Blood pressure medication may need to be adjusted. Contaminants may include mercury, PCBs, and dioxins in predatory fish (predatory fish include tuna, salmon, perch, pike, and swordfish). Vegetarians, Vegans, and Plant Sources Vegetarian and vegan diets are almost always very low in omega -3s, since fish oil is the most efficient way to obtain omega -3s. Some pl ant-based supplements are available, but they generally are low in the essential omega -3 elements, EPA and DHA. This requires taking a lot of capsules to get a therapeutic dose. CONCLUSION Promising, but not yet proven. A diet rich in small, non -predator y fish \u2014 typically about 2 meals a week \u2014 is good for almost everyone. Use of a diet rich in non -predatory fish or fish oil may prevent or moderate both depression or bipolar disorder and may be effective in stabilizing mood and enhanc ing the effectiveness of conventional anti -depressants . Although the evidence is preliminary, omega -3s may also serve as a neuroprotectant. Other uses being studied may encourage use of omega -3s pending developme nt of evidence to the c ontrary. FISH IS BEST Fish oil and other s upplements supply omega -3s. But fish also contains vitamins, minerals, other fats, and other substances that may work with the omega -3s to protect the heart and 160 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents overall health. Moreover, fish (but not fried fish), which is rich in protein and low in satura ted fat, can replace less -healthful foods such as red meat. The benefits of fish far outweigh the potential risks from contaminants, especially if you eat it in moderation (two servings a week, about 8 to 12 ounces total, is the base recommendation) and va ry the types of fish. Small, shorter -lived fish lower in the food chain, such as sardines and mackerel, accumulate less toxins. The EPA and DHA content of fish depends on the species. A good listing is found at http://fn.cfs.purdue.edu/fish4health/HealthBenefits/omega3.pdf Lake Trout is the highest concentration, at 3% EPA and DHA. Atlantic salmon is almost 2%, but most fish are under 1%, meaning 100 grams of fish for each gram of omega -3s. At that rate, a therapeutic dose of 9.6 grams would take a lot of fish: up to two pounds a day. So if you are taking omega -3s as medicine, supplementation is essential. 161 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents OUTLINE EFFICACY MOOD STABILIZATION IN BIPOLAR DISORDER DEPRESSION ADJUNCTIVE USE FOR DEPRESSION DISSENT CONCLUSIONS SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: P ERINATAL AND POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN MILK AND INFANT FORMULA SUGG ESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: SCHIZOPHRENIA SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN PERSONALITY DISORDER UNPROVEN USES: BUT UNPROVEN USES: ADHD SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: OTHER CONDITIONS DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS FISH CONTAMINATION/NO TESTING CHOICE OF FISH FARMED FISH CANNED FISH LARGE DOSAGES PLANT SOURCES DOSAGE FISH OIL ISSUES FISH IS BEST RESEARCH 162 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents 1. From the beginning of human evolution up until about 1920, the human diet consisted of between a 1:1 and a 2:1 ratio of omega -6 to omega -3 essential fatty acids.1 The modern (American) diet has shifted this balance to between 10:1 and 30:1, as omega -3 essential fatty acids have declined due to (1) the prevalent use of omega -6 seed oils (especially corn) instead of omega -3-rich plants to feed the animals and farmed fish that make up our animal protein, (2) decline of fish consumption and general lack of flax seed oil, canola oil, walnuts, and leafy green vegetables in our diet, (3) hydrogenization of oils for use in processed foods, thus increasing trans -fatty acid intake which interferes with fatty acid synthesis (4) loss of cereal germ by modern milling processe s, and (5) increase in sugar intake which interferes with the enzymes of fatty acid synthesis.2 2. Hibbeln has shown that depression is inversely correlated with fish consumption. Japan has the lowest levels of depression (0.12% of population), Iceland the lowest levels of bipolar depression, and Hong Kong the lowest homicide levels. These countries also have the fish oil consumption with about 730 to 1000 mg per day of EPA and DHA, compared to the US, where consumption of EPA and DHE on average is about 180 mg per day .3 3. Stoll presents studies of the blood and tissue characteristics of people with major depression.4 These studies are striking, showing the correlation of EPA depletion with clinical symptoms of depression, using the usual clinical scales. 4. EFFICACY : Although larger and longer -term studies of depression are needed, as are studies targeting the effect of omega -3 essential fatty acid supplementation on other mental health conditions, and the sources consulted for this outline are split, it appear s likely that omega - 3s will eventually be found effective as CAM treatments for bipolar disorder and depression and to enhance the effectiveness of conventional anti -depressants. Of eight sources that discuss omega -3s, three sources do not recommend omega -3 supplementation 163 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents for depression or bipolar disorder, but five do, and all eight acknowledge that there is promising evidence for its use in the treatment of depression and bipolar disorder. 5. MOOD STABILIZATION IN BIPOLAR DISORDER: Bipolar disorder (manic -depressive illness) is a common neuropsychiatric illness with a high morbidity and mortality. Despite the use of mood -stabilizing drugs, including lithium and valproate, there are high rates of recurrence. All of the currently available mood -stabilizing d rugs appear to affect neuronal signal transduction (or second messenger) mechanisms. Biochemical studies have shown that dietary treatment with omega -3 essential fatty acids leads to the incorporation of these compounds into the membranes crucial for cell signaling. This mechanism may be similar to some of the actions of lithium and valproate. Fugh -Berman and Cott relied on Stoll's pioneering bipolar study to indicate the potential of omega -3s as psychotropic agents for mood stabilization : A double -blind study by Stoll, A. et al . (1999)5 demonstrated that dietary supplementation with omega - 3 essential fatty acids resulted in marked mood -stabilizing activity for persons with bipolar disorder. Significant group differences in favor of fish oil were seen on the Hamilton Depression Scale, the Global Assessment Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Scale. The authors concluded that omega -3 essential fatty acids were well tolerated and improved the short -term course of the illness. In Brown et al . II, Mischoulon and Freeman surveyed the conflicting studies, plus the meta -analysis by Sarris et al . (2012), concluding that people with rapid cycles may benefit less from omega -3 supplementation and that most of the benefit is probably in the depressive rather than in the manic phase of the illness.6 6. DEPRESSION It has been theorized that omega -3 essential fatty acids may reduce the development of depression, since depressive patients show significant depletion of omega -3s. There appears to be an inverse relationship b etween the prevalence of major depression and 164 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents the amount of fish consumed per capita worldwide.7 There are at least four studies showing reduced levels of omega -3 essential fatty acids in the blood of depressed people8. Uncontrolled clinical trials of omeg a-3 essential fatty acid supplements have shown promise in the treatment of major depression, and several controlled trials are underway. Brown et al. recommend omega -3 essential fatty acids for depression based on the preliminary studies summarized by Par ker et al in a 2006 review.9 According to Brown et al., \"the mixed results [of the studies cited by Parker et al .] reflect differences in the dose and proportions of EPA and DHA, patient selection, and other [unspecified] factors.\"10 The 2006 review includ ed Mischoulon as a coauthor. Brown et al . II included Mischoulon as the lead author on omega 3s. See below. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum's perspective on omega -3 fatty acids is provided by Andrew L. Stoll, M.D., Director, Psychopharmacology Research Laboratory , McLean Hospital Faculty, Harvard Medical School. Writing one year before his book was published, Stoll updates his single 1999 bipolar study with three more double -blind, placebo controlled studies of bipolar disorder and seven of unipolar depression. As of 2007, the score stood at two positive studies and two no benefit studies of the use of omega -3s in bipolar disorder and four positive studies and three no benefit studies of the use of omega -3s in unipolar depression.11 Stoll concludes that the problem with the studies is that the optimal omega -3 fatty acid formulation for mood disorders needs to be determined.12 Stoll critiques the studies, including his own 2007 study which showed no benefit in depression. In that case, the formula of omega -3s that was used was DHA 2.2 g. per day and EPA 0.6 g. per day, the reverse of the ratios recommended by Stoll and Brown et al ., and less than 1/3 of the dose used by Stoll himself in his 1999 bipolar study. But many other methodological issues are debatable, includi ng, in particular, the lack of an active placebo, since most of the consumers were taking antidepressants (both tricyclics and SSRIs) throughout the studies. Interestingly, one of the no benefit studies involved consumers who had gone off their anti -depres sants at least two weeks before the study began. In addition, the same study used a dose of 2 g. per day of DHA, with no EPA at 165 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents all. Both of these factors may have contributed to the no benefit result.13 As analyzed by Stoll, the studies as a whole suggest that a high EPA to DHA formula of omega -3 essential fatty acids is potentially beneficial as an adjunctive therapy, when used with other medications. No studies have yet tested the effect of an appropriate dose of omega -3s without other medication in bipol ar illness. In his comprehensive book, The Omega -3 Connection,14 Stoll asserted: \"We are learning that restoring the body's natural balance of omega -3 oils may improve a multitude of medical disorders, including coronary artery disease, major depression, an d bipolar disorder. \" Stoll added that: Furthermore, it is possible that omega -3 fatty acids may actually prevent these disorders from developing as well.15 Weil puts omega -3s at the top of his recommended supplement list, finding the literature on omega -3s \"the strongest evidence we have for non -drug treatment of depression.\"16 Weil recommends two - four g per day of omega -3s as the basic building block of his \"Program for Optimal Emotional Well -being.\"17 Lake and Spiegel confirm the efficacy of omega -3s in th e treatment of depressed mood and bipolar disorder.18 However, they caution against use of omega -3s as monotherapy for depression unless antidepressants have proven ineffective or are poorly tolerated. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative M edicine has sponsored studies investigating the effects of omega -3 fatty acids/fish oil on major depression in adults, adolescent depression, and depression in people with multiple sclerosis. It concludes that more research is needed to determine whether o mega -3 fatty acids help symptoms of depression.19 However, NCCAM cites with approval the 2010 meta -analysis of Appleton et al. that concluded that: \"the evidence provides some support of a benefit of n -3 PUFAs in individuals with diagnosed depressive illnes s but no evidence of any benefit in individuals without a diagnosis of depressive illness.\"20 7. ADJUNCTIVE USE FOR DEPRESSION 166 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents The interaction of omega -3 essential fatty acids and many other medicines, particularly psychotropic medicines, remains to be studie d. As analyzed by Stoll, the studies as a whole suggest that a high EPA to DHA formula (Brown et al suggest 2:1, but the usual fish oil concentration is 3:2, and more study is needed to make a recommendation) of omega -3 essential fatty acids is potentiall y beneficial as an adjunctive therapy, with very few side effects, when used with psychotropic medications. However, a recent trial found no benefit, and the studies are split. Also, many potential adjunctive medicines remain to be tested. Thus, caution is advised in considering adjunctive use of omega 3s, even though no interaction has yet been shown. This requires consultation with the prescribing physician. Writing in Brown et al. II, Mischoulon, D. and Freeman, M.P. recommend a ratio of 3:2 or greater.21 In one well -designed 2009 study, published in JAMA, treatment of patients with coronary heart disease and major depression with sertraline (Zoloft) and omega -3 fatty acids did not result in superior depression outcomes at 10 weeks, compared with sertralin e and placebo.22 As stated by the researchers, this study has no bearing on persons without coronary heart disease, and whether higher doses of omega -3 or sertraline, a different ratio of EPA to DHA, longer treatment, or omega -3 monotherapy can improve depr ession in patients with coronary heart disease remains to be determined. It may be that omega -3s are less additive to SSRIs than to tricyclic antidepressants, or the EPA/DHA formula may require adjustment, although it seems to have followed the Stoll/Brown et al . ratio. A 2010 study by Canadian researchers came to the opposite conclusion.23 In the Canadian study, the results were inconclusive until persons with anxiety were screened out. The new figures showed that s upplementation with EPA and DHA signific antly reduced the number of major depressive episodes reported by patients with major depression without a comorbid anxiety disorder. One is left to wonder whether such screening would affect other studies as well. 167 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Given the reasonable known drug interacti ons and side effects, there is no question that use of omega -3s as adjunctive treatment under physician supervision is justified by the available evidence , except for persons using sertraline, who should consult their prescribing physician about the impact of the 2009 study on that decision. Although no adverse drug interactions were noted in the 2009 study, the benefit of such adjunctive treatment may also be small. 8. DISSENT The Natural Standard , Berkeley Wellness Reports and Consumer Reports all dissent . Thus, three of the ten sources consulted, whil e acknowledging \"promising\" evidence for the efficacy of omega -3 essential fatty acids in depression and bipolar disorder , did not recommend use of omega -3s for any mental health condition. The Natural Standard acknowledges \"promising\" evidence for the efficacy of omega -3 essential fatty acids in depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, but rates all three as \"C,\" \" unclear scientific evidence for this use .\" The Natural Standard particularly acknowledges t he \"positive\" results of recent studies in postpartum depression and childhood depression, but continues to call for more studies before endorsing its use to address mood disorders. The Natural Standard rates omega -3s as \"A\" (\"strong scientific evidence\") for secondary cardiovascular disease prevention and \"B\" (\"good scientific evidence\") for primary cardiovascular disease prevention and for use in rheumatoid arthritis.24 While touting the effectiveness of omega -3 essential fatty acids in the prevention and treatment of heart disease, the treatment of high triglycerides, and the treatment of inflammatory effects of autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis and psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis, Berkeley Wellness avoids taking a position on the effectiveness of omega -3s in depression and other mood disorders, stating only: \"A 2007 review by the American Psychiatric Association suggested that people who have mood or depressive disorders consume at least 1 g of EPA/DHA per day from fatty fish or supplements. Howev er, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association in October 2009 168 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents [cited above under Adjuctive Use] found that omega -3 supplements (2 g a day) worked no better than a placebo in treating depression in people with heart disease. In early 2010 a research review in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded that there is some evidence of a beneficial effect, but only in people with clinically diagnosed depression.\"25 Consumer Reports lists fish oil as one of eleven \"supplements to consid er,\" but only describes it as \"effective\" for triglyceride reduction and as \"likely effective\" for prevention of heart disease and stroke. None of the potential effects of omega -3s on mood disorders is mentioned. 9. CONCLUSIONS : Given the undoubted need for a diet rich in fish or supplemented by other sources of omega -3s in order to maintain a healthy heart and circulatory system, the promising studies of depression and bipolar disorder cited in this outline, the strong endorsements by four sources, and the m inimal drug interactions and side effects, consumers may reasonably conclude from the current evidence that omega -3s are worth a try to help in coping with mental health conditions despite lack of compelling evidence of effectiveness. Omega -3s are promisin g prevention and treatment strategies for depression and bipolar disorder. See below for the areas of possible efficacy in addition to depression and bipolar disorder. 10. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: PERINATAL AND POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION: Depletion of materna l omega -3 essential fatty acids has been noted during pregnancy. The physiology of pregnancy involves the mobilization of essential fatty acids from maternal stores to the fetus and especially the developing brain and nervous system. Supplementation with o mega -3 essential fatty acids may ensure adequate supplies for the needs of the mother and the developing fetus and should be as common as folic acid supplementation --now an almost universal health precaution to prevent birth defects (e.g. Spina bifida). St oll is an outspoken champion of such supplementation. Without dietary supplementation, levels of omega -3 essential fatty acids may remain low for some time postpartum, particularly in lactating women since considerable 169 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents amounts of omega -3s are found in brea st milk. Thus, it is possible that maternal omega - 3 essential fatty acids depletion may contribute to postpartum depression. Joseph Hibbeln followed this same logic from depletion to supplementation with major depression.26 In Brown et al. II, Mischoulon a nd Freeman describe Freeman et al.'s own study that showed 50% improvement in postpartum depression from omega -3 supplementation, regardless of the dose. However, two open label studies have shown no preventative effect.27 Mischoulon and Freeman counsel use of omega -3s in pregnancy and during lactation to minimize the risk of other medications. 11. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: BREAST MILK AND INFANT FORMULA: Breast milk, unlike infant formula, has relatively high concentrations of omega -3 and omega -6 essential fatty acids. The World Health Organization recommends that essential fatty acids be added to infant formulas. European infant formulas are routinely fortified, and the FDA has only recently allowed the addition of fatty acids to infant formulas sold in th e United States. It goes without saying that lactating mothers should also consider taking omega -3 essential fatty acid supplements as long as they are breast -feeding. Omega -3 essential fatty acids are crucial in the development of the fetal and neonatal b rain and nervous system. One study showed that intellectual development may also suffer in infants deprived of these fatty acids.28 The Natural Standard dissents, stating that it is unknown whether use of omega 3s by pregnant and breastfeeding mothers is be neficial to infants, nor are there any safety data, particularly on large doses. Although it is used in infant formulas, there are no data supporting that use either. 12. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: SCHIZOPHRENIA: There is increasing evidence that neuronal i njury due to oxidative stress (excess oxygen radicals) contributes to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Considerable effort has been directed towards determining the respective roles of increased oxidative stress (resulting in increased fatty 170 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents acid brea kdown) versus dietary deficiencies or defective metabolic pathways on membrane fatty acid concentration.29 It is likely that both processes are important for the development of a pathological state. In an uncontrolled study, dietary supplementation with concentrated fish oil led to significant improvement in negative (alogia, flat affect, anhedonia, apathy, motor retardation) but not positive symptoms (hallucinations, disorganized thought) as rated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Improvement in clinical symptoms was related to increased levels of omega -3 essential fatty acids in the blood.30 Thus, it is conceivable that dietary supplementation with antioxidants and omega -3 essential fatty acids at the initial stages of illness may prevent further oxidative injury and thereby ameliorate and prevent further possible deterioration of associated neurological and behavioral deficits in schizophrenia. Dr. Stoll is strongly supportive of this hypothesis. Lake cites the studies, which are split, partially because the improvement in positive and negative symptoms has been shown mostly in people NOT taking antipsychotics.31 Adjunctive use studies have been inconsistent. Hibbeln and Mischoulon have suggested that omega -3 fatty acids are less effective in schizo phrenia and dementia than in depression and bipolar disorder. 32 In Brown et al II, Mischoulon and Freemen cite the newer studies, which concur.33 13. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER : As to borderline personality disorder, a use supp orted by Brown et al ., the evidence is week, but a 12 -week randomized, placebo -controlled clinical trial (albeit using only a passive placebo) of persons with a history of self -injury found that those given omega -3 essential fatty acids had significantly g reater improvements on both the Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Rating Scale, as well as on scales measuring suicidality and stress.34 14. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT/DEMENTIA : No adequate study has been done of long -term use o f omega -3s for prevention/treatment of cognitive impairment or dementia. But the evidence cited by Brown et al . 35 is suggestive: Low levels of omega -3 essential fatty acids have been found in persons with dementia and Alzheimer's 171 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents disease. In an eight year prospective study of 1200 elderly subjects, those with low serum DHA had a 67% greater chance of developing Alzheimer's disease than those with high DHA. In a double -blind randomized placebo -controlled study of 174 very mildly impaired Alzheimer's disease patients, 600 mg of EPA per day slowed cognitive decline over a six - month period. The 2012 Oregon Brain Study results confirmed the coincidence of higher omega -3 levels and higher cognitive function.36 Brown et al . concede that more studies are needed to co nfirm or refute the potential neural protective effects of omega -3s suggested by these studies. Berkeley Wellness adds that research suggests that omega -3's may \"help preserve cognitive function in older people.\" 37 15. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: ADHD Brow n, Gerbarg, Mischoulon, Freeman, Weil and Stoll all consider omega -3s to be potentially beneficial for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A 2011 review and meta -analysis of ten studies by Bloch et al , cited in Brown et al . II, showed a \"modes t but significant benefit in reducing ADHD symptoms from formulas rich in EPA.38 In his book, ADHD Without Drugs,39 Sanford Newmark, M.D., an integrative pediatrician and colleague of Weil's, summarizes the evidence. Newmark concludes that: \"In my opinion, every single child who has ADHD would benefit from taking, or needs to have at least tried, a daily omega -3 fatty acid supplement.\"40 He starts with the proposition that children with ADHD have lower omega -3 levels in their bodies as a result of an unknown metabolic process related to their condition. 41 Then, disregarding the studies in which the children took stimulants in addition to omega -3s, he demonstrates the improvement in symptoms when children with ADHD are given omega -3 supplements as monotherapy. In one study, in which 40 children were given either a fish oil supplement or olive oil placebo every day for three months, the children taking the fish oil improved significantly in their ADHD symptoms as well as in measures of learning ability. In fact, on almost every measure, including attention, hyperactivity, and cognition, the children taking fish oil showed substantial improvement, whereas those taking placebo had minimal or no improvement.42 In another study, this same group of 172 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents researchers looked at improvements in reading, with subjects taking omega -3's showing a 9.5 month increase in reading skills over the three months of the study, compared to 3.3 month increase in reading skills for the placebo group.43 In Non-Drug Treatments for ADHD , Brown, R .P. and Gerbarg, P.L.44 encourage trials of EPA/DHA particularly in subtypes of ADHD that have shown better responses: hyperactive, inattentive, or mixed .45 A recent meta -analysis of 10 reliable studies by Bloch and Qawasmi46 found no significant difference in the efficacy of omega -3 treatment for ADHD based on whether the supplementation was given as monotherapy or as adjunctive treatment with traditional ADHD drugs. Finding that the studies are split, and that the ratio of EPA to DHA in the zone is a critic al uncontrolled variable (generally, Bloch and Qawasmi found, the higher the EPA dose, the greater the effect), the meta -analysis recommended against monotherapy if the ADHD symptoms are severe, opting for adjunctive treatment as \"a reasonable treatment st rategy as augmentation to traditional pharmacotherapy or for those families reticent to use [stimulants]. \"47 They emphasized that the efficacy of omega 3s appears to be \"modest\" compared to other available drug treatments for ADHD. 16. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN U SES: OTHER CONDITIONS: Weil adds seasonal affective disorder.48 Lake and Spiegel add violent and impulsive behavior and dyslexia .49 Writing in Brown et al. II, Mischoulon and Freeman add self -harm and childhood mood disorders. Of great interest in light of t he ongoing controversy over EPA to DHA ratios, a military suicide study reported by Mischoulon and Freeman showed that higher serum DHA appeared to have a greater protective effect.50 These indications are all encouraging but preliminary. 17. DRUG INTERACTIONS The Natural Standard points out the theoretical potential of interaction with aspirin, anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin) or heparin, anti -platelet drugs such as and nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen 173 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents (Mot rin, Advil) or naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), all of which could exacerbate bleeding. In addition, omega -3 essential fatty acids may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with herbs and supplements that are believed to increase the risk of bleeding such as ginkgo, garlic and salt palmetto. Writing in Brown et al . II, Mischoulon and Freeman counsel that special care should be taken by people taking medications that affect platelet function. However, Fugh -Berman and Gerbarg state categorically that fish and fish oil do not increase bleeding risk. Berkeley Wellness minimizes concerns about bleeding: \"Contrary to previous thinking, fish oil does not cause excessive bleeding, even when combined with blood -thinning drugs. An interaction with anti -clotting medicat ion (such as warfarin) is theoretically possible, but recent research has found no evidence of significant risk, even at high doses.... Similarly, [one] need not worry about interactions with aspirin, which also has an anti -clotting effect. Indeed the Amer ican Heart Association advises low -dose aspirin and omega -3s for people with heart disease.\" Low -dose aspirin used for the prevention of myocardial infarction appears safe in combination with omega -3s. Stoll comments that \"only rare and sporadic cases of abnormal bleeding have been reported\" in the use of omega -3s. Specifically, he states that: \"No cases of bleeding have been reported in the greater than 17,000 subjects that have participated in omega -3 clinical trials.\"51 The Natural Standard cautions that omega -3's may lower blood pressure and add to the effect of blood pressure medications, commenting that multiple clinical trials have reported \"small\" reductions in blood pressure (two to five mm. of mercury), with the effect proportional to the dosage. T hus, caution is warranted if the consumer has low blood pressure or is taking blood -pressure -lowering medications. The Natural Standard concludes that the risk of blood pressure changes at lower dosages is low. Still, people contemplating surgery or dental procedures should discuss significant omega -3 supplementation with their surgeon or dentist and consider tapering off for the procedure. 174 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Omega 3s may lower blood sugar levels \"a small amount,\" and may lower triglyceride levels but actually worsen low -dens ity lipoprotein (LDL) (\"bad\") cholesterol levels. LDL increases in the range of five to ten percent have been observed with the intake of omega -3 essential fatty acids. However, the Natural Standard states that significant blood sugar effects are \"unlikely .\" Although the Natural Standard documents \"slight\" increases in fasting blood glucose levels in persons with type II diabetes, it adds that \"available scientific evidence suggests that there are no significant long -term effects of fish oil in patients wit h diabetes, including no changes in hemoglobin A1c levels.\" The Natural Standard discounts reports of increased insulin needs in persons taking omega -3 supplements. Berkeley Wellness cites a 2006 review by researchers at Tufts, which, \"found that the doses used in most studies have little or no effect on blood sugar control.\" On the other hand, Berkeley cautions that, \"in a Norwegian study the next year, very high dosages [six g per day] did raise blood sugar in people with type II diabetes. The Norwegian r esearchers suggested that taking one g of omega -3s a day would have a negligible effect on blood sugar.\" The American Heart Association advises that taking more than three g of omega -3s per day can worsen glucose control in people with diabetes. With regar d to cholesterol and triglycerides, the Natural Standard cautions that omega - 3's may add to the potential triglyceride lowering effect of agents such as niacin but may work against the potential LDL -lowering properties of agents such as barley, garlic, guggul, psyllium, soy, or sweet almond. 18. SIDE EFFECTS The FDA classifies low intake of omega -3 essential fatty acids from fish as \"generally regarded as safe.\" Essentially, the side effects are those of eating fish, which is generally viewed as presenting a favorable proportion of benefit to justify the risk, except in people allergic to fish. And the effect of fish and fish oil on the heart and circulatory system is sufficiently demonstrated that we all need to eat more. 175 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents The Natural Standard adds that: \"Ca ution may be warranted, however, [in people with low blood pressure], in [people with diabetes or] at risk of bleeding, or in those with high levels of ...LDL.\" NCCAM concurs. However, Berkeley Wellness, Fugh -Berman and Gerbarg dissent, as set forth above. The Natural Standard cautions that vitamins A and D are added to many commercial fish oil products. As a result, regular use may lead to elevated levels of these fat soluble vitamins. Since fat soluble vitamins can build up in the body and cause toxicity, consumers should be aware of any vitamins added to fish oil products in order to assure appropriate total vitamin dosages. Hypervitaminosis A is generally only seen when cod or other fish liver oil is used in very high dosages. Hypervitaminosis A occurs wh en the maximum limit for liver stores of retinoids is exceeded. The excess vitamin A enters the circulation causing systemic toxicity. According to Brown et al ., the most common side effec ts of omega -3s are gastrointestinal nausea, heartburn, stomach pain, belching, bloating, or diarrhea. These side effects are most apparent in large doses. Brown et al . indicate that the possibility of triggering manic episodes is \"probably low,\" but should be kept in mind. Finally, the Natural Standard documents \"mild\" elevations in liver function tests, \"rare\" skin rashes, and \"rare\" reports of mania or restlessness. According to the Natural Standard , it is unknown whether use of omega 3s by pregnant and b reastfeeding mothers is beneficial to infants ; nor are there any safety data, particularly in large doses. Although it is used in infant formulas, there are no data supporting that use either. Given the side effects and the likely benefits, the use of omeg a-3s by pregnan t and breastfeeding mothers as well as young children seem reasonable. But large doses should be monitored by a physician. 19. FISH CONTAMINATION/NO TESTING : Fish may contain mercury and PCBs and dioxins which could be especially dangerous to young children and pregnant or breastfeeding women. Contaminants are much more 176 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents likely in fish meat than in fish oil, but absent uniform testing, this is difficult to verify, and the brutal truth is that unless government does it or requires it, sellers of fish are unlikely to test for contaminants because of the cost of testing and the potential that testing could make the fish unmarketable. Berkeley Wellness minimizes concerns about contamination of fish oil: \"Recent analyses of fish oil supplements, inclu ding testing by ConsumerLab.com, did not find detectable or significant levels of mercury or unsafe levels of PCBs, dioxins, or other contaminants, in inexpensive as well as pricey brands. This is not surprising, since mercury tends to accumulate in larger fish, and supplements are generally made from smaller species (such as anchovies or sardines) or algae (which supply only DHA). Moreover, the mercury in fish is water soluble and thus tends to accumulate in fish meat, not in the fat or oil. Finally, most supplements are processed to reduce levels of PCBs and other contaminants.... The slightly higher levels in a few products may unnecessarily contribute to PCB exposure, but are unlikely to endanger human health.\" 20. CHOICE OF FISH : Contaminants can best be a voided by avoidance of fish liver oils (such as cod liver oil) and very limited consumption of predator fish. Small, short -lived fish such as anchovies, sardines, menhaden, carp, catfish, herring, lake trout, and mackerel, and small predators like bluefish , pompano, salmon, striped sea bass, tuna (albacore), and the like are preferred, since large, predatory, long -lived fish tend to concentrate pollutants at the top of the food chain. Commercial fish oils are generally derived from appropriate uncontaminate d fish stocks, but attention to the label is important to assure this. 21. FARMED FISH : Farmed fish are becoming problematic due to the increasing use of vegetable feeds, which are rich in omega -6s but poor in omega -3s. They may also suffer from contamination , especially if animal byproducts are used for food. Reporting and regulation may eventually address these concerns, but they are not now addressed and are becoming more and more significant as a greater proportion of fish in our diet come from 177 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents aquaculture . Thus, despite the increased risk of contamination, \"wild\" fish are preferable until fish farm inspection reports are included on fish labels . 22. CANNED FISH : Canned salmon and tuna are rich in omega -3s, but the amounts vary a lot. Regular canned salmon, w ith skin and bones, has about 10 to 14 grams of total fat per four ounces (about \u00bd cup), which provides about 2,000 milligrams of omega -3s. Skinless, boneless, \"premium\" canned salmon has much less total fat (about three to four g per four ounces), and thu s only about 650 milligrams of omega -3s. 23. LARGE DOSAGES: Large amounts of fish or fish oil consumption (in \"Eskimo\" amounts) call for greater vigilance to avoid contaminants. Greater dosages have been associated with nosebleeds or blood in the urine and ca ll for closer monitoring to avoid serious complications such as stroke or high blood sugar. Gastrointestinal upset is common with the use of fish oil supplements, as is diarrhea, with potentially severe diarrhea at very high doses. The Natural Standard also documents reports of fishy aftertaste, increased burping, acid reflux/heartburn/indigestion, abdominal bloating, and abdominal pain. The Natural Standard recommends that gastrointestinal side effects be minimized by taking fish oil with meals and startin g with low dosages. Large amounts can be taken better in two or more separate dosages. 24. PLANT SOURCES: Until recently, plant sources of omega 3s were discounted for use as CAM because they were so weak. Chia seeds and flax seeds contain ALA (Alpha -linoleni c acid) and can be ground to get access to it, but the efficiency of converting ALA to EPA and DHA is low and varies by individual. However, recent supplements have used algal oil instead of flax seed oil, yielding up to 300 mg of combined DHA and EPA per capsule.52 Note, however, to get the 9.6 g required to replicate Stoll's dosage, this would require swallowing 32 large capsules of algal oil every day. 25. DOSAGE : 178 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents The Natural Standard states that the \"average\" dietary intake of EPA and DHA is only 0.1 to 0. 2 g per day, so omega 3 products should be counted assuming a zero baseline. The World Health Organization and governmental health agencies in \"several countries\" recommend consuming 0.3 to 0.5 g. per day of EPA and DHA. If you have heart disease, the Amer ican Heart Association recommends that everyone get one g (1,000 milligrams) per day of EPA and DHA from fatty fish or fish oil supplements. It advises two to four g of EPA and DHA per day from supplements for people with high triglycerides. The clinical studies thus far have generally used fish oil (about 3:2 EPA to DHA). There is no clear evidence of the relative contribution of EPA and DHA to the observed outcomes. Stoll asserts that EPA appears to be \"the most mood stabilizing component\" in fish oil, and cites anecdotal data that suggest that too much DHA relative to EPA may actually worsen mood. 53 Brown et al . note that most consumers cannot tolerate the gastrointestinal side effects of using over 6 g. per day of omega -3 essential fatty acid. People also have a hard time with the number of pills required. However, Brown et al. explicitly recommend 8 -10 g. per day of EPA and DHA in a 2:1 ratio for consumers who can tolerate it.54 If you are healthy, the standard advice is to eat fatty fish twice a week . But if you don't eat this much fish, you can consider taking a fish oil supplement \u2014500 to 1,000 milligrams per day EPA/DHA, on average. And to get 9.6 g per day, the dosage used by Stoll in his 1999 clinical trial, you would have to go on a daily ration of fatty fish. At that point, use of a fish oil supplement becomes essential. Weil recommends two to four g per day of omega -3s in fish oil for prevention and treatment of depression . Stoll originally recommended one to two g per day of total omega -3s (EPA plus DHA) for health, mood or cognitive enhancement, and clinical doses of from two to five g per day. However, in his chapter in Mischoulon and Rosenbaum, Stoll upped his recommendation to between one and six g per day of EPA alone, accompanied by a less er dose of DHA. At the top end, this would approximate the 9.6 g. per day used by Stoll in his 1999 clinical trial . Stoll adds that: \"The effective 179 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents dosage appears to be highly individualized, and if the initial target dosage is not adequately effective, a gradual titration of the omega -3 fatty acid dosage is often required to empirically determine the optimal dosage .\"55 Writing in Brown et al . II, Mischoulon and Freeman recommend against use of omega -3s as monotherapy and counsel physician supervision for do sages of over 3g per day.56 Given the wide disparity in these numbers and the gastrointestinal side effects, consultation with a health care provider seems prudent before upping the dose above one to two g. per day of combined EPA and DHA and then doing so slowly, separating and timing doses with meals. 26. FISH OIL ISSUES High quality fish and fish oil from \"wild\" fish low on the food chain remains the best source of omega -3 essential fatty acids. Look for the total amount of EPA and DHA on the label. It may say 1,000 milligrams of fish oil concentrate per capsule, but the small print may show only 300 milligrams of EPA and DHA (or simply \"omega -3 fatty acids\"), which is the key number. That would mean you need to take three capsules to get about a gram a day . Some fish oil capsules are more concentrated than others. There's no evidence that expensive over -the-counter fish oil brands are better than store brands \u2014or that special marine oils such as krill, or widely promoted Norwegian or Icelandic brands, are be tter.57 Claims about \"molecular distillation\" and other special purification processes are unverified. Like all over -the-counter supplements, fish oil capsules are unregulated, so you don't really know what you are getting. Still, recent tests of dozens of brands found that nearly all supplements contained the amount of omega -3 fats listed on the labels \u2014with no significant contamination. The only regulated product is the prescription supplement, Lovaza, approved by the FDA for treating high triglycerides. To reduce gastrointestinal problems such as belching, take fish oil capsules with food, divide the doses among your meals, and start at a low dose and gradually increase it. Discard fish oil supplements that have a rancid smell or taste. 180 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Don't take cod liver oil, unless the label shows that its vitamin A content has been reduced. The oil usually contains very high levels of A, which may weaken bones and cause birth defects. Since it is made from livers, which filter out toxins, there is also greater concern a bout contaminants, even though the oil is supposed to be purified. 28. FISH IS BEST . Fish oil supplements supply omega -3s and are generally free of contaminants. But fish also contains vitamins, minerals, other fats, and other substances that may work with th e omega -3s to protect the heart and overall health. Moreover, fish, which is rich in protein and low in saturated fat, can replace less -healthful foods such as red meat. As emphasized by Berkeley Wellness , the benefits of fish far outweigh the potential ri sks from contaminants, especially if you eat it in moderation (two servings a week, about 8 to 12 ounces total) and vary the types of fish. A large study in the journal Circulation: Heart Failure found that eating fried fish at least once a week was associ ated with a 48 percent higher risk of heart failure , so other cooking methods are preferred.58 29. FISH DOSAGE: The EPA and DHA content of fish depends on the species. A good listing is found at http://fn.cfs.purdue.edu/fish4health/HealthBenefits/omega3.pdf Lake Trout is the highest concentration, at 3% EPA and DHA. Atlantic salmon is almost 2%, but most fish are under 1%, meaning 100grams of fish for each gram of omega -3s. At that rate, a therapeutic dose of 6-9 grams would take a lot of fish: up to two pounds a day, so supplementation is essential. 29. RESEARCH: Long -term outcomes -- benefits and liabilities from continuing treatment with omega -3s and comparative assessment with othe r drugs -- require further investigation, as do the systematic tracking, reporting and quantification of adverse effects . 181 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents 1 Stoll, Andrew L., M.D., The Omega -3 Connection (Simon & Schuster, New York 2001). 2 Schmidt, Michael A., Smart Fats (Frog, Ltd., Berkeley, CA 1997), at 45. 3Hibbeln, J.R., \"Seafood Consumption and Homicide Mortality.

However, a 2013 update from Berkeley Wellnes s examines the recent evidence: \"In 2012, two large analyses pooled data from well -designed clinical trials involving people with pre -existing heart disease or multip le risk factors. One was published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, the other in the Journal of the American Medical Association . They concluded that overall the evidence does not support claims that omega -3 supplements help prevent cardiovascular eve nts. Another large analysis of various studies, published last year in the British journal BMJ , looked at the link between fish consumption or omega -3 supplements and the risk of stroke. It found that the 26 observational studies suggested that higher fish intake was associated with moderately reduced stroke risk, but that the 12 clinical trials (considered the gold standard in medical research) concluded that the supplements offered no benefit. In a large trial in the New England Journal of Medicine in 201 2, people with diabetes or prediabetes, who are at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, took 1,000 milligrams of omega -3 supplements a day or a placebo. After an average of six years, the supplement takers were no less likely to have a he art attack or stroke or to die. A British study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2011 found that various doses of omega -3s did not help keep arteries flexible in healthy people (ages 45 to 70). Another British study, in the journal Atherosclerosis , similarly found no vascular benefit in people with peripheral artery disease. However, a 2012 analysis in the same journal concluded that omega -3s ca n improve arterial functioning. In the newest study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May , more than 6,000 Italians at high risk for cardiovascular disease took 1,000 milligrams of omega -3 supplements a day. After five years, they did no better than a placebo group in terms of heart attacks, strokes and death rates. This was true even of people w ith low baseline dietary intakes of omega -3s and those not taking statins. 183 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Critics have raised questions about some of the newer studies, saying they were not large enough to detect benefits, didn't last long enough or used omega -3 doses that were too low . Others have criticized how the studies included in the meta -analyses were selected. Had certain other studies been included, the critics say, the overall results would have been more positive. Still, benefits that are so hard to spo t are likely to be qui te small. Bottom line : The proposed cardiovascular benefits of fish oil supplements now seem uncertain. Some major studies are underway and may help clarify matters. In any case, your best bet is to get your omega -3s from two or three servings of fatty fis h a week. The AHA continues to advise people with heart disease or high triglycerides to consider taking the supplements, after consulting their doctors. That's still good advice if you don't eat fish, especially since some of the other proposed benefits o f omega -3s may still pan out. The supplements have few, if any, serious adverse effects \u2014unless, that is, they lead you to think you can eat an unhealthy diet or can avoid taking the stati ns or other drugs you may need. The most salient point may be that in the studies from recent years, far more participants at elevated cardiovascular risk were taking \"state -of-the-art\" medication, such as statins and blood pressure drugs, compared to early studies. That helps explain the apparent lack of effect of the supp lements. Even if omega -3s provide benefits, these would be hard to detect against the backdrop of the much larger benefits of these drugs. That could also make the supplements all the more unnecessary. (The same thing is seen in studies of low -dose aspirin , the benefits of which appear much smaller than previously estimated, now that so many high -risk people are taking s tatins.)\" Phospholipid Spectrum Disorder in Psychiatry , Peet, ,I., & Horrobin, D.F.

Rhodiola's efficacy in treating mental health conditions isn't well -known in America because the earliest studies suffered from poor controls and generalized claims and were not done in the United Stat es or Western Europe. However, those studies and the traditional practices that spawned them have caused people to use rhodiola to treat a wide range of conditions, such as stress, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment, primarily in Easter n Europe and Asia, but increasingly in the United States and around the world. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS Studies document rhodiola's impact on an individual's overall general physical and mental health. Rhodiola can be used to reduce stress, combat fat igue, increase mental performance and improve physical and mental fitness and resi lience. Stress, Neuroprotection and Mild to Moderate Depression Three of the sources consulted for this outline (most of which ignore rhodiola) concur that rhodiola is a pr omising and relatively benign treatment for a number of mental health 187 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents conditions, including stress, neuroprotection (\"cognitive stimulation\" and improvement in \"cognitive deficiencies\" and memory) and mild to moderate depression. The Natural Standard mildl y but decisively dissents, finding these claims unsubstantiated. All other claims (below) are promising but unproven. Bipolar Disorder Two sources warn against rhodiola use in persons with bipolar disorder. But some experts (Brown et al. ) believe, based on clinical experience, that moderate doses of rhodiola can be helpful in persons with bipolar disorder who are taking mood stabilizers and whose mood swings are primarily depressive with only occasional mild hypomanic symptoms. This requires working closely with a physician if there is a ny chance of bipolar \"cycling.\" Adjunctive Use When combined with tricyclic antidepressants, rhodiola use has been associated with reduction of antidepressant side effects, particularly sedation fatigue and sexual dysfunction , as well as an improvement in depressive symptoms. Brow n et al . state that they use rhodiola as an adjunctive treatment in depression because it \"increases mental and physical energy\" and \"improves mood and stress tolerance.\" Anxiety Brown et al. note th at rhodiola also can be useful in the treatment of anxiety, and a recent open -label study supports this use. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia Syndrome, and ADHD Brown et al. add that their clinical experience shows rhodiola to be beneficial in chro nic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia syndrome. It is also a useful adjunctive treatment in attention deficit disorder (ADHD), since it activates cognition and tends to improve accuracy, alertness and attention. 188 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Exhaustion, Decreased Motivation, Daytime S leepiness, Decreased Libido, Sleep Disturbances, and Cognitive Complaints Iovieno et al . state that rhodiola is effective in treating physical deficiencies such as exhaustion, decreased motivation, daytime sleepiness, decreased libido, sleep disturbances, and cognitive complaints such as concentration deficiencies, forgetfulness, decreased memory, susceptibili ty to stress, and irritability. Alleviation of Side Effects of Psychotropic Medication In Brown et al. II, Panossian asserts, based on one small study , that rhodiola can relieve side effects of psychotropic dru gs used to treat schizophrenia. DRU G INTERACTIONS AND SIDE EFFECTS Drug Interactions If you are considering continuing the use of rhodiola with psychotropic drugs, you should definitely consult w ith the prescribing physician, even though there are no documented interactions except for MAOIs. Brown et al. advise against use of rhodiola with MAOIs. Rhodiola may add to the stimulant effects of caffeine; it also may augment antianxiety, antibiotic, an tidepressant medications. Rhodiola may affect platelet aggregation in higher doses. Rhodiola may interfere with birth control pills. Rhodiola may interfere with diabetic or thyroid medication. Side Effects Generally uncommon and mild. May include allergy, irritability, insomnia, increased blood pressure, and chest pain. Most frequent side effects (according to Brown et al ) are activation, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, and occasional headache. 189 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Evidence for the safety and appropriateness of rhodiola use duri ng pregnancy and lactation is not currently available, and rhodiola is therefore not recommended for pregnant women or during breastfeeding. Likewise, safety and dosages for children have not been demonstrated. Brown and Gerbarg note that rhodiola has been used in small doses for children as young as 10 years of age without adverse effects but emphasize that dosages for children (8 -12 years old) must be small and carefully titrated to avoid overstimulation. CONCLUSION Rhodiola is a very promising treatmen t for stress and mild to moderate depression and as a neuroprotectant and is promising for a number of other mental health conditions. The risk of drug interactions and side effects is minimal, but consumers using antianxiety, antibiotic, or antidepressant medications, birth control pills, or diabetic and thyroid drugs should consult with the prescribing physician. Rhodiola is just becoming known in America, and is being popularized by experts like Brown, Gerbarg, Mischoulon, and Weil. Although much more st udy is needed, it appears to have a promising future in low -risk mental health treatment and self - care. 190 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents OUTLINE PREPARATION ESTABLISHED USES EFFICACY: STRESS, NEUROPROTECTION, AND MILD TO MODERATE DEPRESSION DEPRESSION: THE 2007 DARBINYAN ET AL.

Rhodiola rosea (hereinafter \"rhodiola\") is widely distributed at high altitudes in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it is known as \"golden root,\" \"arctic root,\" \"roseroot,\" or \"A aron's rod.\" It also is found in North America. The roots of the plant have been used for centuries in the traditional medicine of Asia, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe as a health -enhancing supplement stimulating the nervous system, enhancing physical and mental performance, and alleviating fatigue, psychological stress, and depression. 2. PREPARATION: Rhodiola extract is mainly used in the form of capsules or tablets, though tinctures are also available. The capsules and tablets contain 100, 150, or 180 mg of 191 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents a standardized amount of 3 percent rosavins and 0.8 -1 percent salidroside because the naturall y occurring ratio of these compounds in Rhodiola rosea root is approximately 3:1. Rhodiola is obtained by drying and grinding the root. It contains many biologically active substances. Its stim ulating and adaptogenic properties are attributed to p -tyrosol, salidroside, rosavins, and additional phenolic compounds. Specific neurochemical mechanisms have been documented for some but not all of the bioactive compounds. The combined effects differ from the effects of isolated components. Rhodiola extracts are standardized for both rosavins and salidroside. The standardized Swedish Herbal Institute formula, SHR -5, is commo nly used in the newer studies of depression, cognitive function and fatigue. 3. ESTABLISHED USES: Soviet studies have led to wide use of rhodiola in Russia, the former Soviet Union, and Scandinavia to combat stress, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and cognitiv e impairment, including brain injury, and to promote strength, endurance, and physical and mental performance. 4. EFFICACY: STRESS, NEUROPROTECTION AND MILD TO MODERATE DEPRESSION: Three of the sources consulted for this outline concur that rhodiola is a pr omising and relatively benign treatment for a number of mental health conditions, including stress, neuroprotection (\"cognitive stimulation\" and improvement in \"cognitive deficiencies\" and memory) and mild to moderate depression. The Natural Standard mildl y but decisively dissents. Rhodiola has long been classified by Soviet researchers as an \" adaptogen ,\" a substance that nonspecifically increases the resistance of an organism to a variety of chemical, biological, and physical stressors. The Soviet Union began testing rhodiola as far back as the 1960s for enhancement of mental and physical performance, aiming at military, space exploration, and sports applications. According to Brown et al ., Soviet scientists found that rhodiola was 192 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents effective for: \"cogniti ve stimulation with emotional calming; enhanced learning and memory; and increased accuracy in mental performance for prolonged periods of time.\"1 Rhodiola was found to protect against physical stresses, fatigue, cold, heat, toxins, and radiation. Studies of uncertain methodological rigor found that rhodiola \"enhanced intellectual work capacity, abstract thinking, and reaction time.\"2 In a 2002 review (the first review of rhodiola in English) and in their 2004 book , The Rhodiola Revolution ,3 Brown and Gerb arg state that the primary clinical uses of rhodiola are for cognitive disorders, memory and performance under stress. However, based on trials conducted in the former Soviet Union beginning in 1987 and their own clinical practice, they note that rhodiola also can be useful in the treatment of depression. A recent small open -label study showed promising results for the use of rhodiola for anxiety , but the size and open label study design preclude any conclusion at this point except for the usual need for mo re study.4 In Brown et al. II, Panossian, A.G. asserts that rhodiola studies have shown a \"significant antidepressant effect.\"5 The randomized study conducted by Darbinyan et al . and published in 2001 assessed \"fatigue and mental performance\" (associative thinking, short -term memory, concentration, speed of audio -visual perceptions, and other parameters defined as a \"Fatigue Index\") in a group of 56 young, healthy physicians on night duty receiving a low-dose treatment of SHR -5 rhodiola ( 170 mg per day ). The tests were performed before and after night duty during three two -week periods in a double -blind cross -over trial. A statistically significant improvement in fatigue and mental performance was observed in the treatment group during the first 2 weeks . By 6 weeks, however, the effect appeared to be lost. Iovieno et al . speculate that the effect decline could be due to the relatively short -term benefit of use of SHR -5, or to the low dose used, or the cross -over design of the study .6 Brown and Gerbarg add th at the dosage used in this study was sub -therapeutic -- about half of the recommended dose. They state that in their clinical experience, some people are able to continue taking rhodiola in 193 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents therapeutic doses for many years with good response, while others may need to take \"holidays\" of from 2 to 4 weeks to restore effectiveness. In a second study, 40 medical students were randomized to receive either a low dose of SHR-5 (100 mg per day ) or placebo for 20 days during a stressful examination period. Subjects receiving rhodiola demonstrated significant improvements in physical fitness, mental fatigue, psychomotor performance and general well -being . They also reported improvement in sleep patterns, reduced need for sleep, greater mood stability, and a greater mo tivation to study .7 (Spasov et al ., 2000). Fintelmann and Gruenwald's 2007 open label study of \"Vigodana\" (a German vitamin and mineral tonic8 containing rhodiola)9 showed it to be associated with a statistically significant (P<.001) improvement in physic al and cognitive deficiencies. The treatment was rated as \"good\" by over 80% of physicians and subjects. More research is needed, but the use of rhodiola for cognitive disorders is certainly promising. This treatment cannot yet be treated as fully evidence -based, but, in light of a benign side -effect profile, it may be appropriate to use rhodiola for prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment as the evidence is accumulated. 5. DEPRESSION: THE 2007 DARBINYAN ET AL. STUDY: There is only one randomized stu dy investigating the antidepressant effect of rhodiola monotherapy in people with depression. Darbinyan et al . (2007)10 conducted a 6 week double -blind, placebo -controlled pilot study with 89 persons diagnosed with mild to moderate depression . The research subjects were randomized to receive placebo or SHR -5 at two different doses ( 340 or 680 mg per day ). The efficacy of SHR -5 was assessed on the basis of specific subgroup scores of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM -D). Although qualified by the researchers as \"modest but significant ,\" the results were impressive, with equivalent results at both doses : Group A (340 mg): from 24.52 to 15.97 (p<0.0001) Group (placebo): from 24.17 to 23.41 (p=0.3306) 194 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents No side effects were reported. A recent article by Iovieno, et al . (2011) describes rhodiola as part of the \"next wave of natural antidepressants, \" based on the 2007 Darbinyan study cited above. Weil concurs that: \"If you experience mental fog and fatigue along with mild to moderate depression, you might consider a trial of rhodiola .\"11 6. DISSENT: Although the Natural Standard acknowledges the use of rhodiola as an \"adaptogen\" for \"mental performance,\" it rates the use as \" C,\" \"unclear scientific evidence for this use .\" It states: \"Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that rhodiola may benefit learning, memory and mental performance,\" but it deems the data \"insufficient\" to make a recommendation. The Natural Standard does not even mention use of rhodiola fo r stress or depression. 7. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: ANXIETY, ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER (ADHD), CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, FIBROMYALGIA SYNDROME: As described above, recent evidence, suggests that rhodiola may be a promising treatment for anxiety . Brown et al. also state that rhodiola can be helpful in the treatment of attention deficit disorder (ADHD), chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia syndrome , since it activates cognition and tends to improve accuracy, alertness, attention, and energy, but clini cal study is needed to validate these clinical observations. Given the relatively small risk, people may reasonably decide to give rhodiola a try in the absence of conflicting information. 8. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: BIPOLAR DISORDER: Russian researcher s warned against rhodiola use in persons with bipolar disorder (\"manic -depressive illness\"). Rhodiola has not been studied in bipolar depression , and Iovieno et al advise caution in patients with bipolar spectrum disorders because of its activating effect, which could increase the risk of \"cycling.\" However, Brown et al. believe, based on their clinical experience, that \"[rhodiola] can be quite helpful in [persons with bipolar disorder] on mood stabilizers whose mood swings are primarily depressive with onl y occasional mild hypomanic 195 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents symptoms.\"12 This requires working closely with a physician if there is any substantial risk of bipolar cycling 9. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: ADJUNCTIVE USE FOR DEPRESSION: Only very small, old and generally not well -controlled S oviet studies have thus far documented the antidepressant effect of rhodiola as an adjunct to synthetic antidepressants . These studies suggest that when combined with tricyclic antidepressants, rhodiola use was associated with a marked reduction in medicat ion side effects as well as an improvement in depressive symptoms .13 Brow n et al . state that they use rhodiola as an adjunctive treatment in depression with all classes of antidepressants except MAOIs, because it \"increases mental and physical energy\" and \"improves mood and stress tolerance.\" People should consult with their prescribing physician before attempting such adjunctive use. Further studies of Rhodiola as an adjunct to all classes of antidepressants would be worthwhile. Brown et al. advise against use of rhodiola with MAOIs 10. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: EXHAUSTION, DECREASED MOTIVATION, DAYTIME SLEEPINESS, DECREASED LIBIDO, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, AND COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS: Iovieno et al. concur that rhodiola is effective for improving physical and cogn itive deficiencies such as exhaustion, decreased motivation, daytime sleepiness, decreased libido, sleep disturbances, and cognitive complaints such as concentration deficiencies, forgetfulness, decreased memory, susceptibility to stress, and irritability . 11. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: ALLEVIATION OF SIDE EFFECTS OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION: In Brown et al. II, Panossian, A.G. asserts that rhodiola studies have shown \"alleviat[ion of] psychotropic side effects in subjects [with schizophrenia].\"14 12. DRUG INTERA CTIONS No data are available concerning efficacy, safety and pharmacological interaction of rhodiola used in combination with SSRIs. 196 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents Rhodiola does not appear to interact with other medications such as warfarin (Coumadin) and theophylline, as many CAM trea tments for d epression do, and can be of value in patients who take multiple drugs. However, Brown and Gerbarg caution that in some people doses above 600 mg per day of rhodiola can affect platelet aggregation. Thus, when rhodiola is used with anti -coagulan ts, bleeding and clotting times should be tested and doses adjusted as needed. Brown et al . caution that people should restrict their consumption of caffeine while on rhodiola, since the stimulant effect can be additive. The Natural Standard cautions of a broader risk of additive effects, but the clinical data are not available to demonstrate a significant risk at this point. Brown et al. also caution that, although no unwanted pregnancies have been reported, rhodiola may impair the effectiveness of birth c ontrol pills and may restore or \"normalize\" the menstrual cycle. The Natural Standard warns that rhodiola may lower blood sugar levels and cautions that persons with diabetes or taking blood sugar lowering medications should monitor and adjust dosages acc ordingly. Brown and Gerbarg observe minimal hypoglycemic effects and suggest monitoring for people who are insulin dependent or unstable diabetics. Rhodiola may augment the effects of antianxiety, antibiotic, antidepressant, anticancer, antioxidant, exerci se performance -enhancing and cognitive -enhancing treatments. Rhodiola may also normalize thyroid function and reduce the necessary dose of synthetic thyroid replacement medication. It can further enhance the effects of other treatments for erectile dysfun ction . In animal studies, rhodiola showed no significant effects on the metabolism or serum levels of theophylline or warfarin or on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, indicating that it is not likely to significantly interfere with medications metab olized by the CYP450 enzyme systems .15 There are no reported cases of bleeding attributable to rhodiola. Brown and Gerbarg caution that these are concerns about potential rhodiola interactions with drugs are mostly theoretical and have not been documented t o occur 197 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents in humans. In particular, as addressed under adjunctive use, the addition of rhodiola to antidepressants other than MAOIs is a promising practice. 13. SIDE EFFECTS According to Iovieno et al ., Rhodiola appears to have an excellent safety profile . Side effects are uncommon and mild , and can include allergy, irritability, insomnia, fatigue (not seen by Brown and Gerbarg), and unpleasant sensations, especially at high doses. An increase in irritability and insomnia within several days has been reported in some individuals at doses of 1500 - 2000 mg per day of rhodiola extract, which would be an excessive dose. According to Brown et al , the most frequent side effects of rhodiola are activation, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, and headache. Bruising, increased blood pressure, heart palpitations and chest pain are cited by Brown et al . as uncommon. Rhodiola is best absorbed when taken on an empty stomach 30 minutes before meals, and should be taken early in the day and around noon to avoid interference with sle ep. If adverse effects on sleep occur, a smaller dose with very gradual increases can be suggested. According to Brown et al ., rhodiola (by itself) does not cause addiction, habituation or withdrawal symptoms. Although it has not been clinically linked wi th cancer risk, in light of its estrogen -like effects, Brown et al . advise that women with a personal or family history of breast cancer should be informed that the possibility of increased risk for estrogen -sensitive breast cancer has not yet been adequat ely investigated. Brown and Gerbarg add that rhodiola shows anti -cancer effects in clinical practice, in studies of human cancers transplanted into animals and in a few small human pilot studies. The Natural Standard warns that rhodiola may lower blood su gar levels and may cause increased heart rate, irregular heart beats, salivation, and hormonal (estrogen -like) side effects. Brown and Gerbarg have not observed drops in blood sugar, irregular heartbeats or increased salivation in their clinical practice. Although orally ingested 198 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents rhodiola was found to bind to estrogen receptors, it did not activate them, nor did it increase serum estradiol levels in rat studies.16 Evidence for the safety and appropriateness of rhodiola use during pregnancy and lactation is not currently available, and rhodiola is therefore not recommended for pregnant women or during breastfeeding. Likewise, safety and dosages for children have not been demonstrated. Brown and Gerbarg note that rhodiola has been used in small doses for child ren as young as 10 years of age without adverse effects but emphasize that dosages for children (8 -12 years old) must be small and carefully titrated to avoid overstimulation. They recommend starting with a dose of about 6 mg per day.17 14. DOSAGE: It is impor tant to find a rosea at least 1% salidriside and 3% rosavins. The standardized Swedish Herbal Institute SHR -5, contains 4% rosavins. Brown et al . state that they have recommended doses of 50-600 mg per day of rh odiola to help assuage the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia syndrome, 200 -400 mg per day for adjunctive use for depression, up to 750 mg per day if rhodiola is used alone for depression , and up to 900 mg in some cases. Brown and Gerbar g add that maximum effectiveness in adults generally occurs on dosages of between 150 and 600 mg per day. The table in the Brown et al. text shows a larger range of dosages for depression ranging from 150 to 900 mg per day, making titration with the guidan ce of a physician essential, especially if other antidepressants have been or will be used concurrently to treat the depression, as will often be the case. Brown and Gerbarg state that here is no rationale for dosages in excess of 900 mg per day. 15. RESEARCH : Long -term outcomes -- benefits and liabilities from continuing treatment with rhodiola and comparative assessment with other drugs -- require further investigation, as do the systematic tracking, reporting and quantification of adverse effects. Although consumer use of rhodiola has become common, American academic studies and literature have not kept pace. 199 CAM and Mental Health Return to Ta ble of Contents 1 How to Us e Herbs, Nutrients & Yoga in Mental Health Care, by Richard P.

JOHN'S WORT FOR MILD TO MODERATE DEPRESSION SUMMARY WHAT WE KNOW One of the most well -known and studied CAM treatments, St. John's wort is wid ely used throughout the U.S. and Europe to treat mild to moderate depression. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS Eight sources agree: St. John's wort can help with mild to moderate depression. It is used extensively by prescription in Germany, where randomized s tudies have shown the proprietary Schwabe St. John's wort formula to be effective in moderate to severe depression. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum suggest that it may be a promising practice for severe depression. Although many people use St. John's wort as long -term treatment, there is little evidence of long -term safety or efficacy. All of the clinical studies have been short (24 -26 weeks at the most), and most have been small. Another source (Brown et al ). notes that St. John's wort also can be a useful treatm ent for somatoform disorder (somatization disorder and hypochondria ) and seasonal affective disorder. SIDE EFFECTS & DRUG INTERACTIONS If you are considering continuing the use of St. John's wort with psychotropic drugs, you should definitely consult with the prescribing physician. People with complex medical conditions should insist on careful monitorin g while taking St. John's wort. Side Effects May trigger \"cycling\" in people with bipolar disorder. 202 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Other common side effects, such as nausea, loose stools , and sun sensitivity, are easily addressed by taking food with each dose and using sunscreen. There are insufficient data available at this time to recommend use of St. John's wort by children or during pregnancy or breast -feeding. Drug Interactions St. John's wort has serious potential interactions with many prescription medications, including antidepressants, birth control medications and others . The use of St. John's wort should always be discussed with the prescribing physician. CONCLUSION St. John's wort is a commonly -taken and well -supported treatment for mild to moderate depression. It may have other benefits, but also has serious risks of drug interactions. Adjunctive use with antidepressants requires caution and strict coordination with the presc ribing physician. Long -term use also requires consultation with a health care practitioner. 203 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents OUTLINE PREPARATION POTENTIAL USES EFFICACY : MILD TO MODERATE DEPRESSION SEVERE DEPRESSION 2002 NIMH/NCCAM HYPERICUM DEPRESSION STUDY SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER ADJUNCTIVE USE - CAUTION NEGATIVE EVIDENCE MAJOR RISKS DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS DOSAGE RESEARCH 1. Hypericum perforatum , commonly called St. John's wort, hypericum, Klamath weed, or goat weed, is a perennial plant with yellow flowers who se medicinal uses were first recorded in ancient Greece. It is the most studied and one of the most popular CAM products used for mental health conditions. It is a common roadside plant throughout the United States, Europe and Asia and has a long history o f folk use in many cultures. The prevalent name St. John's wort apparently refers to John the Baptist, as the plant blooms around the time of the feast of St. John the Baptist in late June in the northern hemisphere. 2. Research on St. John's wort has be ha mpered by the intermittent course of most depression (its tendency to come and go), variability in the quality of extracts, use of low doses of the 204 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents antidepressants used as active controls for comparison, and lack of research on the risk of serotonin syndro me when St. John's wort is combined with other anti -depressants. Serotonin syndrome is a serious condition defined by muscle rigidity, fever, confusion, increased blood pressure and heart rate, and coma. See Major Risks, below. 3. PREPARATION: The flowering tops of St. John's wort are used to prepare teas and tablets containing concentrated extracts. There is no standardized extract of St. John's wort, but Mischoulon and Rosenbaum report that most studies use a formula of 0.3% hypericin or hyperforin (the act ual active ingredient is unknown), and the Schwabe company has recently tested its proprietary St. John's wort formula (WS 5570) with success in treating more severe depression. It is urgent that more testing be done and that a standardized non - proprietary extract be developed for further study. Berkeley Wellness cautions that formulas vary widely in the amount and bio -availability of hypericin or hyperforin and that contaminants can be a problem. 4. POTENTIAL USES: According to NCCAM, St. John's wort is used for severe depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders, though the available evidence supports only its use for mild to moderate depression. A few randomized controlled studies show beneficial effects of John's wort for treatment of somatization disorder (similar to hypochondria, transferring emotional conditions to physical symptoms) and seasonal affective disorder. It has also been tested (unsuccessfully) for use to relieve irritable bowel syndrome. 5. EFFICACY : MILD TO MODERATE DEPRESSION: Eight sources cons ulted for this outline agree that St. John's wort is better than placebo and possibly as effective as tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs in treating short -term mild to moderate depression. Fugh -Berman and Cott found St. John's wort to be an evidence -base d treatment for mild to moderate depression, relying principally on a 1996 meta -analysis evaluating twenty - three randomized trials of St. John's wort (of which twenty were double -blind) involving 1757 patients with mild to moderate depression.1 \"Improvemen t in depressive 205 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents symptoms (usually measured by the HAM -D or Clinical Global Impression scale) was observed in all groups. In 15 placebo -controlled trials, St. John's wort was found to be significantly more effective than placebo. In eight treatment -controll ed trials (i.e., trials contrasting St John's wort with an active clinical agent), clinical improvement in those receiving St. John's wort did not differ significantly from those receiving tricyclic antidepressants.\"2 Brown et al. note that recent studies support the efficacy of St. John's wort in treating mild to moderate depression . However, they do not recommend it as a first line treatment because of the incidence of phototoxicity (1%) and the risk of medication interactions. However, they note that people with a history of good response to low - dose SSRIs but intolerable side effects such as weight gain or sexual dysfunction, would be better candidates for St. Johns wort .3 Mischoulon and Rosenbaum are more positive: St. John's wort, \"has demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and equal efficacy to low dose tricyclic antidepressants in most of the older controlled trials, but has had more mixed results against the SSRIs and placebo in some of the newer, large -scale studies. The most recent studies have generally shown St. John's wort to be more effective than placebo, equal to antidepressants, and able to prevent depressive relapses.\"4 However, they conclude that: \"Because the literature as a whole suggests that St. John's wort may be less effective in cases of more severe or more chronic depression, the best candidates for St. John's wort may be those with milder and more acute forms of depression .\"5 Lake and Spiegel (by Yee, Yee and Naing) concur that there is \"compelling evidence\" for the use of St. John's wort in mild to moderate depression, terming studies in more serious depression \"inconclusive.\"6 The Natural Standard concurs that: \" Numerous studies report St. John's wort to be more effective than placebo and equally effective as tricyclic antidep ressant drugs in the short term treatment of mild to moderate major depression (1 -3 months.) \"7 The focus on short -term use is significant. One of the most significant research gaps is lack of 206 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents information on longer -term use of St. John's wort. Although many people use St. John's wort as long -term treatment, there is little evidence of long -term safety or efficacy. The clinical studies have been short (24 -26 weeks at the most), and most have been small. The one exception, the 2002 NIMH/NCCAM Hypericum Depress ion study, was inconclusive. Berkeley Wellness' 2010 review of Dietary Supplements confirms the \"consensus\" that St. John's wort, \"works better than a placebo [and at least as well as tricyclic anti - depressants or SSRIs] in treating people with mild to mod erate depression, at least in the short term .\"8 Consumer Reports found St. John's wort to be, \" likely effective for improving symptoms of some forms of depression. \" The significance of the Consumer Reports reference is that St. John's wort was one of only 11 popular supplements that: \" have been shown to likely be safe for most people and possibly or likely to be effective in appropriate doses for certain conditions .\"9 The Mayo Clinic states that, \"St. John's wort is effective in treating mild to moderate depression and [is] relatively safe. ... It has been shown to be as effective as some prescription antidepressants and with fewer side effects .... Its drawback -- and the reason [that Mayo] gave it a yellow light instead of a green -- is that it interacts with many medications and has caused serious side effects.\"10 The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine addressed St. John's wort in its October, 2012 Clinical Digest: St. John's w ort has been used for centuries for mental health conditions and is widely prescribed for depression in Europe. There is public interest in the United States as well, and many people come to NCCAM's Web site seeking information on St. John's wort for depr ession, consistently making it one of the top five search terms every month. However, current evidence for using St. John's wort for depression is not conclusive , and the herb can have serious side effects. It is also important to note that in the United S tates, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved its use as an over -the-counter or prescription medicine for depression.11 207 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 6. SEVERE DEPRESSION Despite conflicting clinical evidence, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum express hope that St. John's wort may event ually be found effective in moderate to severe depression. But this hope is not shared by the other sources. Berkeley Wellness Reports is more pessimistic, stating flatly that studies do not support the use of St. John's wort for severe depression, depress ion of long duration, or bipolar disorder. The Natural Standard describes the scientific evidence for use of St. John's wort for moderate to severe depression as \"unclear\" and \"speculative,\" and the Mayo Clinic focuses on the negative studies, counseling t he use of stronger medications. Even Consumer Reports limits its endorsement to \"some forms\" of depression, presumably excluding moderate to severe symptoms. 2002 NIMH/NCCAM HYPERICUM DEPRESSION STUDY. The most important reasons why it is so difficult to e valuate the effectiveness of St. John's in severe depression is that preparations of the drug are not standardized and severe depression is notoriously subject to spontaneous remission, as illustrated by the high placebo response (32%) in the landmark 200 2 NIMH/NCCAM Hypericum Depression study , which compared to a 24% remission rate for St. John's wort and sertraline (Zoloft ) and thus cast doubt on the efficacy of St. John's wort in moderate to severe depression .12 With regard to the 2002 NIMH/NCCAM Hyper icum Depression study, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum point out that a 32% placebo remission rate is, in and of itself, a statistical anomaly, and that the occasional high spontaneous remission rate of depressive symptoms, especially in people with moderate to s evere depression, makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of mental health interventions. Thus, according to Mischoulon, the emphasis in the 2002 study should have been on the significant finding of equivalency of efficacy between St. John's wort and ser traline (Zoloft), a well - recognized antidepressant, more than on the difference between both and the high placebo remission rate found in the study. However, the 2002 study had a negative effect on public perception, casting doubt on all depression medicat ions, herbal and 208 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents synthetic, and effectively confining advocacy of St. John's wort to people with mild to moderate depression. The Natural Standard endorses the use of St. John's wort only for mild to moderate depression, which it ranks as \"A,\" \"Strong scie ntific evidence for this use.\" It relegates all other uses to category C, \"Unclear scientific evidence for this use.\" These include anxiety disorder, moderate to severe depressive disorder, obsessive -compulsive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and so cial phobia. The Schwabe study published in 200513 is the most persuasive evidence that St. John's wort may be effective for more severe depression. It used doses of 1800 mg per day of the Schwabe St. John's wort formula (WS 5570) compared to 40 mg daily of paroxetine (Paxil) in 251 participants with moderate to severe depression. Over a six -week period, HAM -D scales decreased by a mean of 14.4 for the St. John's wort formula group and 11.4 for the paroxetine group, a significant improvement in effectiveness over the SSRI . In the continuation phase (after successful acute treatment), both the St. John's wort formula and the SSRI group had similar continued efficacy and similar improvements in HAM -D scores, without statistically significant differences in cont inuation phase outcomes or relapse prevention.14 71% of patients with moderate to severe oppression responded to the Schwabe St. John's wort formula, in comparison to only 60% given paroxetine (Paxil). Thus, according to Mischoulon and Rosenbaum there may be a role for St. John's wort in the treatment of more severe depression , although the difference between German and American studies remains striking, and more studies will be needed to bridge the gap. In particular, the use of different formulas makes it difficult to compare results. The studies have generally used a 0.3% hypericin or hyperforin, but the actual active ingredient is unknown, and proprietary mixes are not disclosed. Among other initiatives to clarify the research record, the Schwabe formula should be further tested in cases of moderate to severe depression to determine whether the company's positive results can be replicated. 209 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Brown et al. II (by Sarris) , while agreeing that St. John's wort is not a first -line treatment for severe depression, concedes that at least one study does support such use if medications are ineffective or poorly tolerated and no suicidal thinking is evident.15 7. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER: Based on a few randomized studies, Brown et al . also recommend St. John's wort for seasonal affective disorder. However, the studies show no incremental benefit over light therapy alone. Other uses, including anxiety, perimenopausal mood disorders, premenstrual syndrome, and fibromyalgia , have been propose d, but neither Brown et al . nor Brown et al . II nor Lake and Spiegel recommend using St. John's wort for any of these uses. The relative risks St. John's wort compared to other CAM remedies weigh against experimentation outside of clinical studies. 8. ADJUNC TIVE USE - CAUTION: Brown et al. recommend that: \"St. John's wort can be useful for mild depression, combined with other treatments, when there is need for an incremental boost in antidepressant effect, if there is seasonal affective disorder, or when soma tic symptoms are prevalent.\"16 But see MAJOR RISKS below, concerning the danger of serotonin syndrome. Adjunctive use of St. John's wort is not yet evidence -based, drug/herb interactions must be monitored and studied, and caution is advised. People consider ing using St. John's wort together with an antidepressant or other prescription medicine are strongly advised to do so ONLY under a physician's supervision. See Drug Interactions below for more information. 9. NEGATIVE EVIDENCE According to Berkeley Wellness , a well -designed 2010 study found St. John's wort ineffective to relieve irritable bowel syndrome . According to Brown et al. II, high -quality clinical trials have ruled out use of St. John's wort for ADHD, obsessive - compulsive disorder and social phobia. 210 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Berkeley Wellness cites negative evidence concerning the use of St. John's wort for treatment of severe depression, depression of long duration, bipolar disorder, anxiety, obsessive -compulsive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, sleep disorders, or premenstrual syndrome . Brown et al. disagree concerning seasonal affective disorder . Existing evidence does not resolve this controversy. 10. MAJOR RISKS The risks of serotonin syndrome in people already taking medication for depression are significant . Seroton in syndrome is a condition defined by tremor, muscle rigidity, fever or drop in body temperature, confusion, increased blood pressure and heart rate, and coma. Using St. John's wort with MAOIs may also increase the risk of severely increased blood pressure . These symptoms may occur in people taking St. John's wort with SSRI antidepressants such ( Parnate). Likewise, the risk of triggering cycling (speeding up the depression/mania cycle) in people with bipolar illness is severe . These two risks make it imperative that people who have already been under physician treatment, and especially people alre ady taking psychotropic medication, get physician advice before using St. John's wort. Use of a mood stabilizer may reduce this risk. 11. DRUG INTERACTIONS The potential drug interactions with St. John's wort are many and serious. This alone caused the Mayo C linic to give St. John's wort a yellow caution light , saying, \"You shouldn't take St. John's wort if you take prescription medications. It's also important to talk to your doctor before taking St. John's wort. If you have a more severe form of depression, you may need a stronger medication.\"17 All of the cited sources urge caution in the use of St. John's wort if any other medications are being taken and counsel physician advice. 211 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Mischoulon and Rosenbaum detail the gradually developing concern over drug -drug interactions with St. John's wort: \"These interactions, occurring largely via the liver enzyme CYP -450-3A4, have resulted in decreased activity of several including warfarin, cyclosporin, oral states that: \"St. John's wort interferes with the way the body processes many drugs using the liver's cytochrome P450 enzyme system. As a result, the levels of these drugs may be i ncreased in the blood in the short term (causing increased effects or potentially serious adverse reactions) and/or decreased in the blood in the long term (which can reduce the intended effects).\"19 Examples of medications that may be affected in this matt er include: carbamazapine, cyclosporine, which prevents the body from rejecting transplanted organs, irinotecan (Camptosar) and possibly other drugs used presumably general), anticoagulants like warfarin (Coumadin) and related anticoagulants, and human immunodeficiency virus drugs such as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors, indinavir (Crixivan) and possibly other drugs used to control HIV infection . The US Food and Drug Administration suggests that people with HIV/AIDS taking protease inhibitors or on NNRTIs avoid taking St. John's wort. Extreme caution is urged for cancer pati ents receiving chemotherapy and for transplant and other patients who take immunosuppressive drugs. It must be presumed that, given the popularity of St. John's wort, many people are combining it with standard antidepressants without telling their doctors . Clinicians should advise their patients not to combine St. John's wort with tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs or MAOIs, because anecdotes of \"serotonin syndrome\" been reported, presumably related to St. John's wort's MAOI activity. See Major Risks, above. In addition, when combined with certain antidepressants, St. John's wort may 212 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents increase side effects such as nausea, anxiety, headache, and confusion. Using St. John's wort with MAOIs may also increase the risk of severely increased blood pressure. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum report 17 cases of psychosis resulting from St. John's wort, of which 12 involved mania or hypomania, adding: \"Clinicians should therefore advise bipolar patients to use St. John's wort only in combination with a mood stabilizer.\"20 People with bipolar illness who take St. John's wort should be carefully monitored, in view of the risk of cycling (speeding up the depression/mania cycle). St. John's wort can interact with birth control pills, but this interaction is controversial , with t hree recent (2003 -2008) studies finding no reduced contraceptive effect and two showing lowered contraceptive efficacy.21 The frequency of interaction is difficult to estimate, and a sixth recent study describes it as \"unpredictable.\" One report mentioned eight cases of interaction, but the rate is unknown. In summary, there appears to be a potential interaction that decreases biologic activity of oral contraceptives, but this may vary depending on the birth control pill formulation and the St. John's wort formulation (hypericin or hyperforin content) and possibly other factors. The studies are limited by small samples, but this is more than just anecdotal evidence. How likely a woman is to become pregnant from this interaction remains unclear, but there is enough evidence to warrant caution. There is a clear risk of breakthrough bleeding from this interaction. All of the sources urge caution in the use of St. John's wort if ANY other medications are being used. The list of additional potential drug interacti ons includes: digoxin (digitalis) or digitoxin which contractions loperamide (Immodium) (Probably uncommon) -type headache non-steroidal drugs like ibuprofen (Motrin) (Probably uncommon) St. John's wort has been shown to decrease the concentrations of imatinab, omeprazole, tolbutamide, caffeine, dextromethorphan, fexofenadine, cimet idine, 213 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents voriconazole, and other medications. This may require adjustments to maintain an effective dose. The Natural Standard advises caution if benzodiazepine tranquilizers, opioids, or P - glycoprotein regulated drugs are taken with St. John's wort. 12. SIDE E FFECTS Brown et al . conclude that: \" Our view of data from 35 double -blind randomized trials found that dropout and adverse effects for patients receiving St. John's wort were similar to placebo, lower than with older antidepressants, and slightly lower th an with SSRIs. \"22 In Brown et al II, Sarris concluded more broadly, based on a review of 16 post -marketing studies (34,834 subjects), that St. John's wort is \"ten -fold safer than synthetic antidepressants.\"23 However, it must be kept in mind that clinical trials often do not include patients with co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders who may be on other medications. In real life clinical practice, many people are taking additional medications for co -morbid medical conditions. Therefore, one cannot al ways generalize the findings from even a randomized study to the potential risks to patients being treated outside of a research trial. Generally, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum report, use of St. John's wort by itself creates few dangers, and adverse events are relatively \" uncommon and mild\" for persons who are screened under the above criteria of risk, somewhat similar but milder than SSRIs . The Natural Standard states that St. John's wort is generally well tolerated for up to three months. The most common adve rse effects include gastrointestinal upset, skin reactions, fatigue/sedation, restlessness or anxiety, sexual dysfunction, dizziness, headache, and dry mouth. Studies suggest that side effects occur in 1 to 3% of patients and that this percentage is simila r to placebo (and less than standard antidepressant drugs). 24 214 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents There are insufficient data available at this time to recommend use of St. John's wort by children or during pregnancy or breast -feeding. The list of all of the many observed side effects of S t. John's wort includes: sensitivity to sunlight (danger of severe sunburn), rare, under 1% risk, and generally in light -skinned people or with use of antibiotics or birth control pills. Nonetheless, persons using St. John's wort should use sunscreen and o ther protection outdoors. gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, loose stools, constipation and heartburn/gastric upset. Persons using St. John's wort should take it with food. anxiety dry mouth dizziness fatigue/sedation headache sexual dysfunction/d isinterest (including impotence) confusion insomnia bruxism (teeth clenching) vivid dreams restless legs tingling suicidal and homicidal thoughts. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum report 17 cases of psychosis, but lesser disturbance is difficult to quantify. If these thoughts persist, get help. 13. DOSAGE: The typical dose for mild to moderate depression is 900 mg per day standardized to contain 0.3% hypericin or hyperforin and split in three dosages. Brown et al . note that treating severe depression may require dose s of up to 1,800 mg. per day for 6 -12 weeks. At these higher doses, Saint John's wort causes more side effects, similar to Zoloft and increases the risk of interactions with medications. This is twice the dosage used in most 215 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents of the cited studies, but becau se of the many different preparations of Saint John's wort, dosages are not truly comparable. Lake and Spiegel and Brown et al . II (through Sarris, J.) recommend dosages of 300 mg three times per day. In the absence of a standardized formulation, dosages c an only be considered as approximations. 14. RESEARCH: Long -term outcomes -- benefits and liabilities from continuing treatment with St. John's wort and comparative assessment with other drugs -- require further investigation, as do the systematic tracking, r eporting and quantification of adverse effects. 1 Linde, K., Ramirez, G., Mulrow, C., Pauls, A., Weidenheimer, W., & Melchart, D., \"St. John's Wort for Depression - An Overview and Meta -analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials,\" British Medical Journal 313(7052):253 -258 (1996). 2 \"Dietary Supplements Natural Products as Psychotherapeutic Agents,\" by Adriane Fugh -Berman, M.D. (of Georgetown Medical School) and Jerry M.

CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents S-ADENOSYL -L-METHIONINE (SAM -E) FOR DEPRESSION AND TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONVENTIONAL ANTI - DEPRESSANTS AND AS A POSSIBLE NEUROPROTECTANT SUMMARY WHAT WE KNOW S-adenosyl -L-methionine (commonly called \"SAM -e\") is a naturally -occurring chemical component present in all cells of the body where it is essential in more than 200 metabolic pathways. SAM -e has been approved as a prescription drug for depression in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Russia, and has been in use in Europe for over three decades. It is available without a prescription in the United States and some other countries. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS SAM -e appears to be an effective treatment for depression: Five of seven sources agree, and the two others say it's promising. SAM -e can be used alone or in conjunction with other antidepressants. Since its side effects are less than those of many antidepressants, SAM -e is better tolerated by many people: It works more rapidly and does not cause weight gain, sexual dysfunction, sedation, or cognitive interference. One leading researcher (Brown et al .) calls SAM -e a \"first line CAM treatment\" for mild, moderate, or even severe depression. Recent studies have shown promising potential for treatment of dementia, but those studies are preliminary and small. Experts have suggested that SAM -e may also help address ADHD. SIDE EFFECTS There are few side effects of SAM -e. It is better tolerated than other antidepressants by older people and by people on CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents medications that compromise liver function. Mild nausea is the most common side effect and can be alleviated by taking SAM -e with food. Like any other activating anti -depressant, SAM -e can worsen underlying agitation, panic, or anxiety. Accompanying use of a mood stabilizer is essential if there is any indication of mania or bipolar disorder. In the absence of bipolar symptoms, a calming agent can be used to deal with any undesirable activating effects of SAM -e. SAM -e has not been studied in children or in pr egnant or breast -feeding women. Accordingly, although there are no contraindications, it cannot be recommended. DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no known drug interactions with SAM -e. In fact, SAM -e may help prevent other drugs from interacting with the liver. CONCLUSION More like a vitamin than a drug, SAM -e is a natural metabolite that the body needs more of as we age or if we become ill. SAM -e is generally safe and evidence -based for the treatment of depression. It is also a promising neuroprotectant and ma y be helpful in treating ADHD. If it were not for the expense and the lack of insurance reimbursement, it would be preferred over most prescription antidepressants. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents OUTLINE EFFICACY MONOTHERAPY FOR DEPRESSION ADJUNCTIVE USE FOR DEPRESSION NEUROPROTECTION SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: ADHD DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS DOSAGE RESEARCH 1. -L-methionine (commonly called \"SAM -e\"), a naturally -occurring metabolite engaged in o ver 200 essential chemical reactions within all cells of the body, was discovered in 1952. SAM -e is safe both short and long -term because it is a substance that the body needs more of as we age or if we get ill. It is more like a vitamin or an amino acid than a drug. 2. It has been approved as a prescription drug for depression in Germany, Italy, Spain and Russia, and has been in use in Europe for over three decades. It was released in the United States for non -prescription sale in 1999. SAM -e participates i n the synthesis of many essential molecules, including the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin, which are implicated in major depression. SAM -e has an important role in the structure of the lipid bilayer in cell membranes, perhaps alte ring their electrical properties to facilitate transmission. This in turn appears to affect mood. 3. EFFICACY 4. MONOTHERAPY FOR DEPRESSION CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Five of the seven sources that address SAM -e agree that SAM -e can be as effective as tricyclic anti -depressants and SSR Is and that it is better than placebo in treating depression. Berkeley Wellness and the Mayo Clinic agree that SAM -e is a promising treatment for depression but caution that long -term benefits and risks are unknown. See below. A 1994 meta -analysis by Bress a, G.M., assembled data from twenty -five double -blind studies (fourteen against tricyclic antidepressants and eleven against passive placebo). The anti -depressant response rate ranged from 17% to 38% better for SAM -e than for placebo. SAM -e was significant ly more effective than passive placebo and \"equivalently effective to and typically better tolerated than\" tricyclic anti - depressants in the treatment of depression.1 Fugh -Berman and Cott concluded that use of SAM -e for depression and for some other sympt oms of mental disorder is supported by a bas ic neurobiological rationale and by some clinical evidence. It functions as a methyl group donor, similar to folate, described in another chapter of this outline. A 2002 review by Brown et al. found SAM -e to be s afe and effective for treatment of major depression. They reviewed sixteen open trials, thirteen double -blind, placebo - controlled studies and nineteen double -blind controlled trials in comparison to standard anti-depressants.2 According to Brown et al ., SAM -e is as effective as traditional antidepressants for depression. A history of a good response to tricyclic antidepressants would \"weigh ... heavily\" in favor of using SAM -e by itself. Brown et al. consider SAM -e to be a \"first line CAM treatment\" for m ild, moderate or severe depression.3 A 2002 review by NCCAM, published by the AHRQ, concluded that: \"Compared to placebo, treatment with SAM -e was associated with an improvement of approximately 6 points in the score of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depre ssion. (This degree of improvement is clinically significant and is equivalent to a partial response to treatment.) CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Compared to treatment with conventional therapy, SAM -e was not associated with a statistically significant difference in outcomes.\"4 Mischou lon and Rosenbaum cite the history of over 40 small clinical studies confirming the efficacy of IV and IM administration of SAM -e monotherapy, beginning in 1973, concluding that \"parenteral [used by injection, bypassing the stomach and entrails] SAM -e app ears to be an effective anti -depressant.\" In the absence of comparative studies, they question the efficacy of oral dosing and the appropriate dose. However, they note that in the 2010 adjunctive use trial cited below, in which Dr. Mischoulon participate d, oral SAM -e was used, with a coating to avoid loss of potency when taken by mouth. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum cite four double -blind studies using oral dosages of 1,600 mg per day that found improvement in depressive symptoms over placebo. The only study that found no greater effect than placebo was flawed by exposure to air of an older form of SAM -e that oxidized and became ineffective (Fava, et al . (1992).5 Mischoulon and Rosenbaum suggest that Fava et al .'s older preparation of the drug (later found to degrade substantially in the gut) and the low (400 mg per day) dosage may have contributed to the lack of effect in the 1992 study. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum recommend oral SAM -e monotherapy for mild to moderate depression, for persons who are intolerant of standard anti -depressants, and for those whose depression has proven unresponsive to a series of anti - depressant trials. They also caution that use of a mood stabilizer is essential if there is any indication of mania or bipolar disorder. They are silen t on adjunctive use, although the subsequent 2010 article co -authored by Mischoulon (below) supports adjunctive use. Lake and Spiegel (through Settle, J.E.) conclude that SAM -e is one of the most thoroughly studied dietary supplements,\" and that recent stu dies have \"la[id] to rest charges of inconclusive data.\"6 They affirm SAM -s's efficacy for mild to severe depression. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Consumer Reports lists SAM -e as one of eleven \"supplements to consider ,\" stating that it is, \" likely effective in reducing symptoms of maj or depression .\" Berkeley Wellness and the Mayo Clinic take a more conservative position, stating that the real risks and benefits are still not established. Berkeley does add that: \"Some studies show that SAM -e might be an effective treatment for depressi on, with fewer side effects than anti -depressant drugs .\" The Mayo Clinic gives SAM -e a green light of approval but states equivocally that: \"SAM -e has promise as an effective treatment for depression..., but the long -term benefits and risks are still unknow n....[I]t's best to consult your doctor before trying SAM -e. Two drawbacks are the inconsistent quality and high price....\" \"...[M]ost of the studies were poorly designed. Large -scale, controlled studies are needed....\" Weil cites with approval the 2010 Papacosta s, Mischoulon, Shyu, Alpert & Fava study cited below under adjunctive use and states generally that SAM -e \"works quickly, often lifting mood within days rather than weeks [as is often the case with prescription antidepressants.]\"7 He says unequivocally tha t: \"You can use SAM -e with prescribed antidepressants (and other medications).\"8 The Berger et al. study, with over 20,000 participants, is a larger scale validation of safety [not efficacy, since the focus of the study was on arthritis] than can be obtain ed for most nutriceuticals.9 5. ADJUNCTIVE USE FOR DEPRESSION Brown et al . suggest that SAM -e is also \"quite useful\" in the antidepressants, SSRIs, SNRIs, and tricyclics. Brown et al . do not specify a recommended d ose for augmentation, but rather suggest starting with 200-400 mg per day and increasing the dose every 3 -7 days as tolerated until a response is achieved. They point out that there is a wide range in dose requirements for response depending on the medicat ion being augmented and the characteristics of the people receiving treatment. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Confirming this suggestion, a 2010 clinical trial by Papacostas, Mischoulon, Shyu, Alpert & Fava found that SSRI non -responders improved significantly when SAM -e was added to th e SSRI dose. The trial had 73 subjects, selected because their HAM -D scores had failed to improve on SSRIs alone. Subjects were given oral dosages of SAM - e 1,600 mg per day (a severe depression monotherapy dose) split into two doses of 800 mg each, to supp lement a long sertraline, duloxetine and venlafaxine, at manufacturer - specified minimum dosages. HAM -D response and remission rates for the SAM -e group were 36.1% and 25.8% respecti vely, compared to 17.6% and 11.7% for the placebo group. Translating that into people, six people treated with placebo responded and four remitted; in contrast, of the people receiving SAM -e supplementation, 18 responded and 14 remitted.10 Additional studie s should help in determining optimal doses, safety for long -term use, effectiveness in preventing relapses, and appropriate protocols for complementary use with other anti -depressant drugs. Thus, use of SAM -e as an adjunctive treatment to tricyclics, SSRIs and MAOIs appears to hold promise. Doses will vary depending on the dose and effect of the antidepressant and the individual's characteristics Larger and longer term studies are needed to confirm and extend the evidence of efficacy and absence of signific ant adverse drug interactions. Other potential drugs with which SAM -e might be used adjunctively remain to be tested. As with any combination treatment, adjunctive SAM -e therapy should be tried under close supervision with the prescribing physician. 6. NEURO PROTECTION Recent U.S. studies have shown promising evidence of effectiveness of SAM -e in protecting the aging brain. Brown and Gerbarg cite three small but promising recent studies of the use of SAM -e for treatment and prevention of dementia, using a comp lex nutriceutical formulation including folate (vitamin B9) (400 micrograms), vitamin B12 (6 micrograms), vitamin E CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents (30 IU), N -acetyl cysteine (600 mg), acetyl -L-carnitine (500 mg), and 400 mg of SAM -e.11 As stated in the Chan, Paskavitz, Remington, Rasmussen, & Shea study , \"Preclinical studies ... demonstrate that the constituents of this formulation provide neuroprotection against oxidative stress, decrease PS -1 expression, -secretase12 activity, Abe ta generation and tau phosphorylation, increase GSH, ATP, and acetylcholine, compensate for ApoE deficiency, prevent cognitive decline, and decrease aggression. These are the principal clinical markers of dementia. The initial two nutriceutical formulation studies, first, an open label study of people with early Alzheimer's Disease and second, double -blind and placebo -controlled study of people without dementia, showed significant improvement in cognitive performance and lessening of behavioral difficulties in all age cohorts below age 74. Of course, variations in the nutriceutical formulation might or might not change these results, and differential studies are needed, but the studies as a whole point to a promising avenue for supplementation with SAM -e in combination with other nutrients. Chan et al. found improved performance of the early Alzheimer's group against historic placebo groups in both the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study -Activities of Daily Living (ADSC -ADL) measurements. The preliminary findings also demonstrated NPI performance, \" apparently equivalent to that of individuals receiving donep ezil and apparently superior to that of individuals receiving galantamine or placebo .\"13 Chan et al . suggest that SAM -e may be the most important constituent of the formulation, but they stress that: \"the impact of simultaneous administration of multiple agents provided superior neuroprotection.\"14 Remington, Chan, Paskavitz & Shea 15 took the next step and did a small double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of the same neutriceutical formulation with SAM -e on 12 institutionalized patients diagnosed with moderate - to late -stage Alzheimer's Disease . Participants receiving the formulation demonstrated a clinically significant delay in decline in the Deme ntia Rating Scale and clock -drawing test as compared to those receiving placebo. Institutional caregivers reported approximatel y 30% impro vement in the Neuropyschiatric Inventory CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents and maintenance of performance in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Stu dy- Activities of Daily Living for more than 9 months. This formulation holds promise for delaying the decline in cognition, mood, and daily function that accompanies the progression of Alzheimer's disease, and may be particularly useful as a supp lement for pharmacological approaches during later stages of this disorder.16 An Italian review of omega -3 essential fatty acids and SAM -e recommended dual supplementation ( with nutriceuticals added) for \"very mild\" Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (Pa nza et al ., epub 2006).17 .In Brown et al . II, Bottiglieri states that even without other nutriceuticals, there is \"significant\" evidence that SAM -e can, \"improve measures of cognitive function as well as mood and speed of mental processing.\"18 Further resea rch on the potential use of SAM -e for neuroprotection in combination with other nutrients could be extremely beneficial. 7. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: ADHD: Brown and Gerbarg cite one 4 -week open -label study of eight men with adult attention deficit hypera ctivity disorder that showed significant improvement in measures of ADHD as well as mood in 75% of the subjects .19 Brown and Gerbarg recommend SAM -e in ADHD if there has been an incomplete response to other medications, stimulants are not well -tolerated or have lost effectiveness over time, or the person is experiencing d epression as well as ADHD.20 8. DRUG INTERACTIONS Brown et al. state that there are no proven reported adverse reactions with other medications and that SAM -e protects the liver from th e adverse effects of other medications. Studies have demonstrated that SAM -e can improve liver function in patients with gallstones, infectious hepatitis, alcohol -related liver disease, or elevated liver enzymes due to medication toxicity.21 Thus, SAM -e can safely augment the beneficial effects of other anti -depressants. According to Brown et al ., it has an electroencephalogram profile similar to tricyclic anti -depressants and is the only CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents adjunctive medication that has been found safe and effective in combin ation with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.22 The 2010 study co -authored by Mischoulon (cited above) showed the safety of using SAM -e as an adjunct to SSRIs. The Mayo Clinic says that SAM -e can react with antidepressants, but no other source agrees with that caution. See Adjunctive Use for Depression above. Consumer Reports lists a risk of a toxic reaction when taken with the cough suppressant dextromethorphan, certain (undefined) anti -depressants, narcotic Parkinson's disease ). Brown, Gerbarg and Mischoulon all dissent from the concern expressed about adjunctive use (see discussion above under that title) and levadopa. Brown et al. assert that SAM -e is beneficial in Parkinson's disease. Levodopa depletes SAM -e causing depressio n and other problems.23 Administration of SAM -e counteracts some of the adverse effects of levodopa. It does not interact adversely. 9. SIDE EFFECTS In Brown et al. II, Bottigleri states the most obvious advantage of SAM -e: \"Unlike many prescription antidep ressants, SAM -e does not cause weight gain, sexual dysfunction, sedation, or cognitive interference.\"24 SAM -e is activating , and can exacerbate underlying agitation, panic or anxiety, like any other activating anti -depressant. Brown et al . emphasize that SA M-e is most effective against enervating depression: It helps to energize persons whose depression is characterized by low energy, low motivation, tiredness, and hypersomnia. For the same reason, according to Brown et al ., if depression is accompanied by a nxiety or agitation, it may be necessary to use benzodiazepine, buspirone, or another anxiolytic for two to three weeks, until the activating effects of the SAM -e are subside. In Brown et al. II, Bottigleri cautions that people who are sensitive to the act ivation produced by SAM -e may need to use a \"calming agent\" until jitters, agitation and anxiety subside. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Because of its activating effects, SAM -e generally should not be taken after 4 p.m. All of the sources warn that SAM -e can induce mania in persons wit h bipolar disorder . Thus, bipolar disorder needs to be ruled out or controlled before initiating use of SAM -e. A careful psychiatric evaluation is the appropriate way to make this diagnosis Mild and transient anxiety, insomnia, loose bowels and heartburn are the only physical effects noted by Fugh -Berman and Cott. Brown et al. cite \"mild nausea\" as the most common side effect of SAM -e. Related symptoms like loose bowels, flatulence and abdominal pain can also occur. Although SAM -e is best taken with an em pty stomach, about 20 -30 minutes before breakfast or lunch. If nausea is problematic, it may be alleviated by eating a small snack right before taking SAM -e. Persistent irritable bowel effects, nausea or diarrhea may require discontinuation of SAM -e treatm ent. Occasionally, patients complain of a headache. As side effects, Consumer Reports lists gastro -intestinal symptoms, dry mouth, headache, mild insomnia, anorexia, sweating, dizziness, anxiousness and nervousness, especially in \"high doses\" (undefined). According to Brown et al ., SAM -e has far fewer side effects than other anti - depressants, works more rapidly, and does not cause weight gain or sexual dysfunction. SAM -e does not cause sedation or cognitive interference, making it preferable to many other treatments for depression. It is also better tolerated by elderly people and by people on medications that compromise liver function. Lake and Spiegel assert flatly that SAM -e presents \"no known medical risks.\"25 Mischoulon and Rosenbaum pote ntial benefits of orally -administered SAM -e for depression, including ease of administration and lack of sexual and weight - gain side effects, as well as a shortening of the latency (delay) of the anti -depressant effect of the drug. If SAM -e is combined wit h a nutriceutical formulation, the side effect and drug interactions of the other constituents must be considered as well. Folate and omega -3 essential fatty acids are dealt with in separate chapters of this outline. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents SAM -e has not been studied in children or in pregnant or breast -feeding women. Accordingly, although there are no contraindications, it cannot be recommended. 10. DOSAGE Fava et al. 's 1995 study used 400 mg per day of injected SAM -e, but there is no standard IV or IM dose, and oral medication is now the dominant form, with a stomach - acid-resistant covering to slow damage through the digestion process. Brown et al . recommend an oral dosage of 400 to 600 mg per day for mild depression, 600 to 1,200 mg per day for moderate depression, 1,200 to 1,600 mg per day for severe depression, and 1,600 to 2,400 mg per day for very severe treatment -resistant depression. Weil concurs. However, they all caution that consumers who are elderly or frail, or have significant medication sensitivities, significant anxie ty, serious gastrointestinal problems, or other serious medical conditions, should work up to these dosages. Starting with a dose as low as 200 mg. per day, Brown et al. recommend increasing the dose to the recommended range as long as the medication is we ll tolerated, over a period of days or weeks. Brown et al. note that dosages above 1,600 mg. per day have not been tested in clinical trials, but are sometimes necessary for response. In Brown et al . II, Bottiglieri states that his review of the clinical trials suggests that the lowest effective oral dose is 800 mg per day for mild to moderate depression and 1600 mg per day for severe depression. For dementia , the three cited trials used 400 mg per day as part of the nutriceutical tonic. In Brown et al . II, Bottiglieri states that 400 mg of SAM -e alone, 3 times a day for 3-5 months, can, \"improve measures of cognitive function as well as mood and speed of mental processing.\"26 All SAM -e products must list the amount of SAM -e in each tablet. Pharmaceutical gr ade SAM -e is available without a prescription. The two pharmaceutical grade brands are Donamet and SAMYR. They are well regulated by the European equivalent of the FDA. Also, ConsumerLab.com posts reviews of other SAM -e brands including analysis of the CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents number of milligrams of active product in each brand. Consumers should be wary of purchasing \"bargain brands,\" because they are often of poor quality with less active ingredients. Brown, Gerbarg and Bottiglieri stress that because SAM -e is easily oxidize d, oral doses should be purchased only in blister packs that isolate each pill. They should not be stored in the refrigerator to avoid condensation within the blister pack. 11. RESEARCH: Long -term studies with tracking of side effects are needed to confirm and extend the positive findings of SAM -e research, particularly in the areas of medication augmentation and neuroprotection. Since many doctors are not yet familiar with SAM -e, dissemination of information about its safety and efficacy is needed. SAM -e has b een used by hundreds of thousands of people and many of these have taken it for 10 years, some for 20 years. No long -term adverse effects have appeared. If anything, it has long -term health benefits. The fact that there was a well -done, closely monitore d for side effects, 3 -year study of SAM -e in 20,000 people should be considered a sufficiently long -term trial. 1 Bressa, G.M., \"SAM Evidence,\" Psychiatric Annals 32(1):29 -44 (2002). 3 How to Use Herbs, Nutrients & Yoga in Mental Health Care, by Richard P.

CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents TRYPTOPHAN/ 5 -HYDROXY -L-TRYPTOPHAN (5 -HTP) FOR ANXIETY, FOR DEPRESSION AND TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONVENTIONAL ANTI -DEPRESSANTS SUMM ARY WHAT WE KNOW Tryptophan , an amino acid, is a precursor of serotonin and has been used since the 1970s to increase brain levels of serotonin. 5-HTP (5 -hydroxy -L-tryptophan) is a modern variant, now extensively marketed in the United States. Before it w as temporarily banned by the FDA (from 1989 -2002), tryptophan was successfully used to supplement standard tricyclic antidepressants. It has been used successfully with MAOIs. Two meta -analyses, in 2004 and 2006, showed modest support for the use of 5 -HTP as an adjunctive treatment for depression. Earlier studies had shown modest effectiveness for anxiety. As with tryptophan, the clinical activity of 5 -HTP is believed to result primarily from its ability to act as a precursor of serotonin synthesis and increase central nervous system levels of serotonin. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS Depression and Anxiety There are insufficient data to recommend use of tryptophan or 5 -HTP, but there is enough promise to merit further research and cautious experimentation if s tandard treatments for depression or anxiety are ineffective or poorly tolerated. Mischoulon concludes that i t is one of the safer of the natural products available for mood disorders, and previous evidence is supportive of its use for depression and anxie ty. Mischoulon says that though it appears to act like an SSRI, he still would like to see a new wave of more rigorous research with current preparations before he proceeds to recommend it on the same platform with the better -tested CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents SSRIs. Despite these ev identiary concerns, 5-HTP has been used clinically for over 30 years for the treatment of a wide variety of conditions, including: fibromyalgia, insomnia, binge eating associated with obesity, cerebellar ataxia, and chronic headaches. There is some ri sk, but it appears to be manageable. DRUG INTERACTIONS Interaction with psychotropic drugs has been tested and appears generally safe, but no reported studies have been conducted with SSRIs. Thus, consumers should consult with the prescribing physician bef ore using 5 -HTP if they are currently being treated with a psychotropic drug, especially an SSRI. SIDE EFFECTS The most common reported adverse effects are gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Sedation is also a concern. These side effects are usually moderate and often abate or disappear once a steady dosage is achieved . Less common side effects may include headache, insomnia, and palpitations. Studies have shown no sign of toxicity. Generally, oral 5 - HTP has been well tolerated. 5-HTP has not been studied in children or in pregnant or breast - feeding women. Accordingly, although there are no contraindications, it cannot be recommended. CONTAMINATION Contaminated tryptophan caused an epidemic of eosinophilia -myalgia syndrome (EMS) tha t peaked in 1989. One researcher cautions that absent testing, tryptophan cannot be presumed to be safe, but others advise that while prescription tryptophan is now safe, consumers should be careful about purchasing non -prescription tryptophan. Thus, ther e is some risk of CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents contamination with both tryptophan and 5 -HTP, and consumers should buy these supplements only from reputable sources. CONCLUSION Promising, but not yet proven. With the exception of adjunctive use, which needs to be under physician super vision, 5 -HTP is a reasonable choice if other treatments prove ineffective or are poorly tolerated.

Tryptophan , an amino acid, is a precursor of serotonin and has been used since the 1970s to increa se brain levels of serotonin . Small, mostly uncontrolled studies have shown positive effects in some depressed patients, but others have not. The reason proposed for the equivocal effects is that tryptophan by itself may be insufficient to boost serotonin levels. On the other hand, using tryptophan (or its active, metabolized form, 5 -HTP) as an adjunct to supplement standard antidepressants has been more successful. Tryptophan was banned by the FDA from 1991 -2002. 5 -HTP has been found effective for relief o f anxiety in preliminary double -blind studies. 2. 5-HTP (5 -hydroxy -L-tryptophan) is a modern variant, now extensively marketed in the United States. 5 -HTP is created in the body from tryptophan and in turn is used by the body to create serotonin. 5 -HTP may thus offer the advantage of bypassing the conversion process, which requires the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, which in turn can be affected by stress and other factors. Supplemental 5 -HTP is created from the seeds of the Griffonia simplicifolia plant and is often combined with St. John's wort. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 3. EFFICACY : MONOTHERAPY AND ADJUNCTIVE USE FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION: There are insufficient data to recommend use of tryptophan or 5 -HTP, but there is enough promise to merit further research and to advise consume rs using tryptophan or 5 -HTP of the promising evidence that exists. Though the list of noted drug interactions and side effects is still short, it will grow longer as we learn more about 5 -HTP and tryptophan. So a consumer must decide whether to take 5 -HTP or tryptophan now because it is promising, or later, when science knows enough to make the call and more information is available. If you are under a physician's care, and especially if you are taking psychotropic medicine, you definitely should talk with your medical doctor before trying adjunctive supplementation with 5 -HTP or tryptophan. Although only five of eleven controlled studies showed statistically significant improvement , according to Brown et al ., increasing numbers of consumers are using 5- HTP as a treatment for depression. Lake and Spiegel (through Settle, J.E.) cite the double -blind study by Kahn et al. (1985, 1987), which showed significant improvement in anxiety symptoms, but not depression 5-HTP was as good as clomipramine (Anafranil) for anxiety, but less effective for depression.1 As early as 1976, Walinder et al .2 found that 24 depressed patients started on clomipramine (Anafranil), an older tricyclic antidepressant, improved more rapidly with tryptophan supplementation. There are also considerable data suggesting that tryptophan depletion can increase depressive symptoms in patients with major depression and seasonal affective disorder. Subsequent reversal of depression with intravenous tryptophan supports the notion of an antidepressa nt effect. No interaction was noted with tricyclic anti -depressants. Lake and Spiegel (through Settle, J.E.) state flatly that the existing research on 5 -HTP is flawed by small sample sizes, uncontrolled study conditions and heterogeneous study populations . Reports of a 20% relapse rate after the first month of treatment makes longer studies essential in assessing the efficacy of 5 -HTP. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents According to Iovieno et al . (Iovieno, N., Dalton E. D., Fava, M. & Mischoulon, D., \"Second -tier Natural 130(3):343 -57 (2011) ), 5-HTP has been used clinically for over 30 years for the treatment of depression. Most studies of the use of 5 -HTP for depression were conducted 20 or more years ago, at a time whe n there was a great interest in the serotonin hypothesis of depression. Its use declined dramatically when tryptophan was banned, but it is making a strong comeback. Iovieno et al. describe all of the old studies and conclude that \" results from the publish ed trials suggest that 5 -HTP may have some efficacy in the treatment of depression and may deserve to be evaluated in more rigorous studies in order to conclusively establish its effectiveness, both as monotherapy and as augmentation .\"3 However, they warn, the older research is defective. A 2002 systematic review of published clinical trials in which 5 -HTP and L -tryptophan were used in depression found that only two of the 108 examined trials were of sufficient quality to meet the inclusion criteria for a meta -analysis. Mischoulon concludes that tryptophan/5 -HTP is one of the safer of the natural products available for mood disorders, and previous evidence is supportive of its use for depression and anxiety, but \"larger and more rigorous studies are needed to clarify its place in the psychiatric armamentarium. \" Mischoulon says that though it appears to act like an SSRI, he still would like to see a new wave of more rigorous research with current preparations before he proceeds to recommend it on the same pla tform with the better -tested SSRIs. Before it was banned by the FDA (from 1991 -2002), tryptophan was successfully used to supplement standard meta -analyses , in 20044 and 2006,5 showed modest support for the use of 5 -HTP as an adjunct to tricyclic anti - depressants in the treatment of depression. As with tryptophan, the clinical activity of 5-HTP is believed to be primarily due to its ability to act as a precursor of serotonin synthesis and increase central nervous system levels of serotonin. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents In their 2006 meta -analysis cited above, Turner and colleagues concluded that 5 -HTP supplementation deserves reconsideration as an anti -depressant, but that it is premature to recommend its widespread clinical use until more extensive clini cal trials further address its efficacy and safety, especially in adjunctive use with SSRIs. Iovieno et al . concur, stating that in the absence of any studies of modern anti - depressants, 5 -HTP should be \"used with caution\" as an adjunct to SSRI or MAOI treatment (due to the risk of serotonin syndrome) and that \"vigilance\" is necessary if 5-HTP is used in monotherapy or adjunctive treatment with tricyclics. Brown et al . II, through Akhondzadeh, Gerbarg, P.L. and Brown, R.P., reviewed 27 studies of 5 -HTP trea tment for depression and found only five showed statistically significant results over placebo. They conclude that, \"limited evidence supports the use of 5 -HTP as augmentation to antidepressant medications.\"6 There are no adequate, well -controlled trials o n the use of 5-HTP or tryptophan in children or in pregnant or lactating women, nor any systematic studies evaluating long - term side effects. 4. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: FIBROMYALGIA, INSOMNIA, BINGE EATING ASSOCIATED WITH OBESITY, CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, AND CHRONIC HEADACHES: According to Iovieno et al ., 5-HTP has been used clinically for over 30 years for the treatment of a wide variety of conditions, including fibromyalgia, insomnia, binge eating associated with obesity, cerebellar ataxia, and chronic head aches . There are no published studies of these uses, with the exception of Lake and Spiegel's reference to insomnia treatment. Lake and Spiegel state that, \"doses up to 600 mg have been shown to be effective in treating insomnia but may increase the incide nce of vivid dreams.\"7 They recommend 100 -300 mg 30-45 minutes before bedtime for insomnia. 5. DRUG INTERACTIONS: There is concern about the possibility that combining tryptophan or 5-HTP with any psychotropic drug, especially an MAOI or SSRI antidepressant, may cause serotonin syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by hypertension, hyperthermia, CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents flushing, hyperreflexia, dizziness, disorientation, and myoclonus. Serotonin syndrome may theoretically occur with any drug that affects the serotonin system. Howe ver, Iovieno et al. report that serotonin syndrome has never been reported in humans in association with 5 - HTP, either as monotherapy or in combination with other medications, including TCAs, MAOIs and tryptophan (citin g Alino et al ., 1976; ., 200 et al. specifically found therapeutic efficacy in augmenting MAOIs with 5 -HTP. This list is incomplete. The Natural Standard does not review tryp tophan or 5 -HTP. 6. SIDE EFFECTS: The most common adverse effects reported by Iovieno et al . are gastrointestinal and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Lake and Spiegel also caution that 5 -HTP may cause sedation. Generally, oral doses of 200 -300 mg per day of 5 -HTP have been well tolerated. Gastrointestinal effects are usually moderate and often abate or disappear once a steady dosage is achieved, and Lake and Spiegel recommend an enteric coating to minimize gastrointestinal side effects . A study compar ing 5 -HTP to 5 -HTP plus a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (PDI) found that gastrointestinal side effects were dose - dependent and occurred more frequently in patients receiving 5 -HTP alone. Less common side effects may also include headache, insomnia, an d palpitations. Available s tudies have shown no sign of toxicity.9 5-HTP has not been studied in children or in pregnant or breast - feeding women. Accordingly, although there are no contraindications, it cannot be recommended. 7. CONTAMINATION: Contaminated tryptophan caused an epidemic of eosinophilia -myalgia syndrome (EMS) that peaked in 1989. More than 1500 cases were reported by 1998, including 27 deaths. Most patients had arthralgia (73%), rash (50%), (43%). Neuropathy or neuritis was seen in 27%. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Almost all cases for which information was available involved tryptophan manufactured by Showu Denko, a company that had recently changed both its m anufacturing process and the strain of bacillus used to manufacture tryptophan. Fugh -Berman cautions that absent testing, tryptophan cannot be presumed to be safe. Lake and Spiegel report one case of EMS in 5 -HTP, for which the contaminant was found. Brown and Gerbarg respond that prescription tryptophan and 5 -HTP dispensed in the United States is free from contamination, but consumers should be careful about purchasing non - prescription supplements. Because of its chemical and biochemical relationship to t ryptophan, the safety of 5 -HTP has been questioned. However, excluding the one established contamination case, according to a 2004 review by Das et al., no definitive case of toxicity had emerged despite the worldwide usage of 5 -HTP for last 20 years, with the possible exception of one unresolved case of a Canadian woman.10 According to Iovieno et al ., writing in 2010, s everal other cases of EMS -like syndromes have since been reported in people taking 5 -HTP, but the substance was not analyzed. According to the Das et al. and Iovieno, et al. reviews, extensive analyses of several sources of 5 -HTP have shown no toxic contaminants similar to those associated with tryptophan nor the presence of any other significant impurities, with the exception of a single study that showed very small amount of toxic chemical in 5 -HTP in lab analysis . But the quality control issue remains. Thus, there is some risk of contamination with both tryptophan and 5 -HTP, and consumers should buy these supplements only from reputable so urces. 8. DOSAGE: Because the half -life of 5 -HTP is just 2 -5 hours, it should be taken in divided dosages throughout the day, at least 20 minutes before meals. The \"average\" dose of 5- HTP cited by Brown et al . is 200-300 mg. per day , in divided dosages. Iovi eno et al . agree. Lake and Spiegel recommend a maximum of 150 mg . Brown et al . found that the doses of 5-HTP used in the reviewed studies ranged from 20 to 3250 mg per day, more often from CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 200 to 300 mg per day, with dose scheduling ranging two - to four -times per day. Their recommended dosing frequency was three times per day . 9. RESEARCH: Long -term outcomes -- benefits and liabilities from continuing treatment with 5 - HTP or tryptophan and comparative assessment with other drugs -- require further investigat ion, as do the systematic tracking, reporting and quantification of adverse effects. The studies are all old, small, and short -term. Despite its popularity, 5 -HTP is truly an orphan supplement. Research needs to consider long -term as well as short -term eff ects and needs to catch up with consumer use. Prompt government and academic attention are required. 1 Lake , J.A. and Spiegel, D., Complementary and Alternative Treatments in Mental Health Care , Am erican Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., Washington (2007) , at 2 Walinder , J., Skott , A. &, Bjorn -Erik, R., \"Potentiation of the Antidepressant Action of Clomipramine by T ryptophan ,\" Arch.

CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents VALERIAN FOR SLEEP DISORDERS SUMMARY WHAT WE KNOW Valerian has long been used for sleep disorders and anxiety and has also been used for other condition s, such as headaches, depression, menopausal symptoms, sedation, irregular heartbeat, and trembling. The research is not yet good enough to confirm those claims. But the risk is minimal. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS Research suggests that valerian may be hel pful for sleep disorders, but there is not enough evidence from well -designed studies to confirm this. Three of the eight sources discussing valerian decline to recommend its use for sleep disorders, citing inadequate evidence, despite its traditional use in the United States, Europe and Japan. Brown et al II's 2013 statement would raise the dissent to 50% -- 4 of 8. In the sleep laboratory, the effects of valerian were not significantly different from those of placebo, and a 2007 meta -analysis concluded th at no rigorous studies had found any significant effect of valerian on sleep. There is not enough scientific evidence to determine whether valerian works for anxiety (the sources are split 3 to 3 on the use of valerian for anxiety) or for other conditions, such as headaches, depression, menopausal symptoms, sedation, irregular heartbeat and trembling. Despite the lack of persuasive clinical evidence of efficacy in treating insomnia, sleep quality remains to be studied, and subjective reports still hold out hope. Valerian may not be ideal for acute treatment of insomnia, but some evidence and analysis suggests that it may be effective in the promotion of natural sleep after several weeks of use. Since it appears relatively safe as long as drug interactions ar e avoided, valerian may be a CAM support to help with sleep even if it can't cure chronic insomnia. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents DRUG INTERACTIONS The Natural Standard cautions that valerian may increase the amount of drowsiness brought on by other drugs or herbs. Berkeley Wellness specifically counsels that valerian not be taken with alcohol, tranquilizers or barbiturates. Valerian interacts with anesthetics and so must be discontinued before surgery. SIDE EFFECTS Valerian can cause mild side effects, such as occasional gastrointest inal effects, headaches, dizziness, excitability, uneasiness, unsteadiness, low body temperature, tiredness the morning after its use, and a \"hangover\" from large doses. Similarly, \"valerian withdrawal\" may occur if the consumer stops using the drug sudden ly after long -term high -dose use. This may entail confusion and rapid heartbeat. Valerian is classified by the FDA as \"generally regarded as safe,\" and some researchers refer to valerian as \"quite safe.\" Long -term use may result in insomnia. Slight reducti ons in concentration and ability to perform complicated thinking may occur for few hours after taking valerian. Use caution if driving or operating heavy machinery. Brown et al . caution against use of valerian in pregnancy or in association with hepatic disease. Safety for children has been more studied but is still controversial. Accordingly, it cannot be recommended. In the absence of a standard extract, no recommendation can be made on dosage. CONCLUSION Promising, but not yet proven. The split of the sources confirms that this is a controversial supplement, even though it appears benign (except for the odor and taste). CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents OUTLINE EFFICACY: SLEEP DISORDERS SUGGESTED BUT UNP ROVEN USES: ANXIETY, HEADACHES, DEPRESSION, MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, SEDATION, IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT, AND TREMBLING DRUG INTERACTIONS SIDE EFFECTS CONCLUSION DOSAGE RESEARCH 1. Valerian , Valeriana officinalis, is a plant native to Europe and Asia; it is also found in North America. Valerian has been used as a medi cinal herb since at least the time of ancient Greece and Rome. Its therapeutic uses were described by Hippocrates, and in the 2nd century, Galen prescribed valerian for insomnia. Valerian is commonly referred to as all -heal or garden heliotrope. 2. Valerian is an odoriferous, popular European botanical medicine used for its mild sedative and tranquilizing properties. The German Commission E recommends 2 to 3 g of the dried root one or more times a day for \"restlessness and nervous disturbance of sleep.\" 3. Valerian has long been used for sleep disorders and anxiety. 4. EFFICACY: SLEEP DISORDERS: Research suggests that valerian may be helpful for sleep disorders, but there is not enough evidence from well -designed studies to confirm this. Three of the eight sourc es discussing valerian decline to recommend its use for sleep disorders, citing inadequate evidence, despite its traditional use in the United States, CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Europe and Japan. In the sleep laboratory, the effects of valerian were not significantly different from those of placebo, and a 2007 meta -analysis concluded that none of the rigorous studies found any significant effect of valerian on sleep. In recommending valerian, Fugh -Berman and Cott relied on two studies suggesting that valerian can induce sleep. Both v alerian preparations produced a significant decrease in subjectively evaluated sleep latency scores and improved sleep quality. However , in the sleep laboratory, the effects of 900 mg of valerian were not significantly different from those of placebo , a finding that they suggest may be explained by the stressful sleep environment obscuring the mild hypnotic action of valerian.1 Brown et al. cite a 2006 meta -analysis of 16 valerian studies that concluded that it might improve sleep without causing side eff ects.2 Thus, they list valerian for use with insomnia. They point out that the valerian has a cumulative effect over time, and maximal benefit may not be achieved for two weeks. However, Brown et al . II cite the 2010 systematic review by Fernandez -San-Mart in et al. that showed subjective improvement in sleep quality but little objective evidence of improvement in sleep problems.3 Mischoulon and Rosenbaum extensively critique the existing clinical trials, beginning with the failure to standardize a valerian extract, different doses and dosing schedules, short terms of treatment, and the blend of symptomatic and non -symptomatic individuals in the sample. In one suggestive study, 121 people with significant sleep disturbance responded initially the same as to p lacebo, but after four weeks, and the valerian -treated group had a significantly better overall response.4 This leads to the suggestion that longer and larger trials of symptomatic people could give a better idea of the drug's potential in treating sleep d isorders. Although it may not be as effective as benzodiazepines for treatment of acute conditions, Mischoulon and Rosenbaum suggest that valerian may be effective in the promotion of natural sleep after several weeks of use. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents However, Mischoulon and Rosenb aum emphasize the 2007 meta -analysis by Taibi et al.,5 with a subtitle that summarizes the evidence to date: \" safe but not effective .\" The analysis included 37 studies, of which 29 were placebo -controlled. None of the rigorous studies found any significant effect of valerian on sleep .6 Lake and Spiegel (in the Ayurveda discussion authored by Prathikanti) , state that seven randomized, placebo -controlled studies support use of valerian for the treatment of insomnia. The Natural Standard is quite negative abo ut the use of valerian for insomnia, qualifying it as \"C,\" \"unclear scientific evidence for this use.\" The Natural Standard recounts the history of valerian use in the United States from the mid -1800s to our era, when it has been replaced by sedatives and analgesics. It remains popular in North America, Europe and Japan. The Mayo Clinic gives valerian a green light , and stating that: \"Valerian appears to be beneficial for insomnia ... and is generally safe at recommended doses .\" However, the clinic recommends using valerian in short courses of treatment, \"no more than a few weeks at a time.\" Weil recommends valerian pills or capsules for insomnia.7 Berkeley Wellness , while discussing the positive trials, concludes that, \" there is inadequate scientific evidence to show the efficacy of valerian in treating ... insomnia .\" Berkeley Wellness concludes in particular that it has yet to be shown that valerian affects the \"quality\" of sleep, for which a sleep laboratory would be required. Valerian's safety during pregnanc y and breast -feeding is unknown. Brown et al . caution against use in pregnancy or in association with hepatic disease. Safety for children has been more studied but is still controversial. 5. SUGGESTED BUT UNPROVEN USES: ANXIETY, HEADACHES, DEPRESSION, MEN OPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, SEDATION, IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT, AND TREMBLING Brown et al ., Brown et al. II, Mayo and Weil all support the use of Valerian for mild anxiety. Mischoulon and Rosenbaum, the Natural Standard , and Berkeley Wellness do CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents not. Brown et al. cite a 2002 randomized, controlled study which showed improvement only on the \"psychic factor\" on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale.8 The abstract concluded: \"Although the principal analysis (HAM -A between group comparison) found negative results, the preliminary data o btained in the present study suggest that the valepotriates may have a potential anxiolytic effect on the psychic symptoms of anxiety.\" There is not enough scientific evidence to determine whether valerian works for other suggested conditions, such as head aches, depression, menopausal symptoms, sedation, irregular heartbeat and trembling. The Natural Standard is quite negative about the use of valerian for \"anxiety disorder, depression, menopausal symptoms and sedation,\" qualifying all as \"C,\" \"unclear scientific evidence for this use.\" 6. DRUG INTERACTIONS: The Natural Standard cautions that valerian may increase the amount of drowsiness brought on by other drugs, although it cautions, \"this is an area of controversy.\" Examples include benzodiazepines and o ther tranquilizers such (Ativan) or (Valium), as phenobarbital, narcotics such as codeine, some antidepressants, and alcohol. In one human study, a combination of valerian and the beta blocker drug propranolol (Inder al) reduced concentration levels more than valerian alone. Agitation, anxiety and self injury were reported in one consumer who took valerian with fluoxetine (Prozac) for a mood disorder. The person was also drinking alcohol, so causality is difficult to a ssign. In theory, valerian may also interact with anti - seizure medications, although there are no human data to that effect. Valerian may also increase the amount of drowsiness caused by some herbs or supplements, including St. John's wort and kava. Berkel ey Wellness specifically counsels that valerian not be taken with alcohol, tranquilizers or barbiturates. Valerian interacts with anesthetics and so must be discontinued before surgery. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 7. SIDE EFFECTS Valerian can cause mild side effects , such as occasiona l gastrointestinal effects, headaches, dizziness, excitability, uneasiness, unsteadiness, low body temperature, tiredness the morning after its use,9 and a \"hangover\" from large doses. Similarly, \"valerian withdrawal\" may occur if the consumer stops using the drug suddenly after long -term high -dose use. This may entail confusion and rapid heartbeat. These symptoms may improve with the use of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (Ativan). Valerian is classified by the FDA as: \" generally regarded as safe ,\" and F ugh-Berman and Cott refer to valerian as \" quite safe .\" Slight reductions in concentration and complicated thinking may occur for few hours after taking the drug. Use caution if driving or operating heavy machinery, since valerian can cause \"impaired vigila nce\" for a few hours after ingestion, according to Lake and Spiegel. Long -term use may result in insomnia. Toxic reactions from valerian are rare but may include blurred vision and dystonia (a neurological movement disorder in which sustained muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures) . Valerian has an unpleasant ta ste and odor. One advantage of valerian over other sedatives and hypnotics is that there have been no reported cases of valerian habituation or abuse and only one case of possible withdrawal symptoms. 8. CONCLUSION: Since it appears relatively safe so long a s drug interactions are avoided, valerian may be a CAM support to help with sleep even if it can't cure chronic insomnia. 9. DOSAGE : The Natural Standard states that doses range from 400 to 900 mg per day of aqueous or aqueous -ethanol extract, corresponding to 1.5 to 3 g of the drug, taken 30 to 60 minutes before going to bed. But the \"recommended dose\" listed by Mischoulon and CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Rosenbaum is lower, between 450 and 600 mg per day , presumably in pill or capsule form, approximately two hours before bedtime. Valer ian has historically been used in the form of a tea, involving 1.5 to 3 g of the roots steeped for 5 to 10 minutes in 150 mm of boiling water. However, this formulation has not been studied. Doses of 300 -1,800 mg per day have been taken by mouth in capsule form. Dosage is difficult to determine for the tea or the tincture. Berkeley Wellness states that because the active ingredient(s) have not been isolated and extracts are so different, no dosage can be recommended. 10. RESEARCH: Long -term outcomes -- benefi ts and liabilities from continuing treatment with valerian and comparative assessment with other drugs -- require further investigation, as do the systematic tracking, reporting and quantification of adverse effects. 1\"Dietary Supplements and Natural Products as Psychotherapeutic Agents,\" by Adriane Fugh -Berman, M.D. (of Georgetown Medical School) and Jerry M.

CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents YOGA FOR DEPRESSION, SCHIZOPHRENIA, ANXIETY, PTSD AND ADHD AND MEDITATION FOR ALL FORMS OF STRESS SUMMARY WHAT WE KNOW It will come as no surprise that yoga and meditation \u2014which come in many variations \u2014have long been acknowledged as allies in mastering the mind and coping with stress. Sci ence is increasingly validating those claims, especially for depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, PTSD (post -traumatic stress disorder), and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Mind -body techniques are difficult to evaluate as CAM treatments be cause it is not possible to double - blind the clinical trials, but single -blind trials, open -label studies, and studies of comparative responses to mass trauma provide a substantial scientific basis for recommending yoga as a CAM treatment. Over 600 researc h studies on one form of meditation, Transcendental Meditation, indicate the positive effects of this stress reducing technique. Yoga and meditation are described separately in this outline, but it should be recognized that anxiety, stress and attention pr oblems can interfere with a person's ability to meditate, and yoga and other physical disciplines, including exercise and other CAM treatments, can help bring about the relaxation response achieved through meditation. In addition, meditation is an integral part of yoga and difficult to separate out. MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS In addition to the expected benefits that come with exercise or relaxation, experts suggest that yoga and meditation may help facilitate psychotherapy. Yoga Studies have shown that yog a can have positive benefits for people with several types of mental health conditions, including depression, ADHD, anxiety, schizophrenia and PTSD. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Meditation Meditation is especially beneficial for reducing stress. Studies show it can also reduce depr ession and anxiety, and help people manage chronic pain. DRUG INTERACTIONS . No drug interactions have been iden tified with yoga and meditation. SIDE EFFECTS The rapid yoga breathing in more strenuous types of yoga may affect people with bipolar disorder, p sychosis or anxiety. Extra caution is advised in people with these symptoms. Like all exercise programs, yoga can cause people to have asthma attacks, pull muscles, or exacerbate existing medical conditions. People with chronic medical conditions and thos e who are pregnant should talk with a doctor before taking up a yoga program. In fact, anyone looking to start an exercise program for the first time should talk to a professional. A well-trained yoga instructor is an invaluable aid in helping people get m aximum benefit from yoga. CONCLUSION Stretching, breathing, relaxation and exercise are good for almost everyone. Yoga and meditation can benefit people who have mental health conditions, as well as those who do not.

How to Use Herbs, Nutrients & Yoga in Mental Health Care, Brown et al. 's book which serves as a major source for this outline, has a major focus on yoga and other \"mind -body techniques,\" including breathing exercises, multiple schools of yoga and meditation, and specialized physical disciplines like Tai Chi,1 Qigong2 and Aikido .3 Brown et al. is the only consulted source that attempts to describe the science supporting these traditional CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents disciplines for the calming of the mind in the interest of enlightenment, promoting mental wellness and healthier understandings of suffering and mortality as a path to spiri tual insight. 2. Yoga breathing exercises are a particularly powerful tool, amplified in Brown and Gerbarg's 2012 book, The Healing Power of the Breath (Shambhala Boston 2012 ). Brown and Gerbarg recommend \"coherent breathing\" and breath counting, as does Weil, who outlines his technique in four simple rules: (1) put your attention on your breath; (2) Try to make your breathing deeper, slower, quieter, and more regular; (3) Let your belly expand with each inhalation; and (4) Practice exhaling more air with each breath.4 The Mayo Clinic recommends \"relaxed breathing\" for anxiety and stress. 3. The Mayo Clinic and Weil strongly recommend yoga and tai chi, and Weil devotes special attention to Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, described below under meditation, which combines yoga postures, breathing and meditation. Weil's recommendations, and the science that supports them, are gathered there. Mayo observes that, in addition to reli ef from anxiety and stress: \"Some clinical research shows that yoga can improve some measures of cognitive function and decrease symptoms of depression.\" 4. Mind -body techniques are difficult to evaluate as CAM treatments because it is not possible to doubl e-blind the clinical trials, but single -blind trials, open -label studies, and studies of comparative responses to mass trauma provide a substantial scientific basis for recommending yoga as a CAM treatment. Brown et al ., who have used yoga techniques exten sively in mass disaster situations,5 also have developed a neurophysiological model to explain how these practices affect mental health in modern scientific terms. It is hypothesized that stress induces imbalance of the autonomic nervous system with decrea sed parasympathetic nervous system and increased sympathetic nervous system activity, under -activity of the inhibitory transmitter GABA, and increased allostatic load. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Thus, yoga practices are effective when they correct underactivity of the parasympatheti c nervous system and GABA system through stimulation of the vagal nerves and reduce alostatic load. Depression, epilepsy, PTSD and chronic pain all respond to vagal nerve stimulation and to pharmaceuticals that improve brain GABA activity. They also show improvement in response to yoga practices. 6 5. Hatha Yoga7 (in the US commonly called \"yoga\"), as it originated in India, consists of a system of spiritual, moral and physical practices. Two central and common aspects of yoga practice today are physical post ures (asanas) and breathing exercises (pranayamas). These breathing exercises aim to focus the mind, facilitate relaxation and enhance wellness. Evidence suggests that these practices result in physiological effects such as increased parasympathetic drive, calming of stress response systems , release of hormones, and modulation of thalamic generators. The thalamus (located in the third ventricle of the brain) plays a critical role in the anatomy of mood and emotion . 6. EFFICACY : A review of the literature eval uating the different forms of yoga suggests potential beneficial effects for depressive disorders , anxiety, stress reduction and general well -being. As stated by Brown et al ., the most \"authoritative\" source, Research Evidence\" (2005).8 However, the underlying trials were small and uncontrolled. 7. DEPRESSION As o f 2005, there were five randomized controlled trials of the use of yoga to alleviate depression, each of which examined different forms of yoga interventions and in which the severity of the condition ranged from mild to severe. All trials reported positiv e findings, but methodological details such as method of randomization, compliance and attrition rates were missing. No adverse effects were reported with the exception of fatigue and breathlessness in participants in one study. The Pilkington et al. summa ry concludes: \" Overall, the initial indications are of potentially beneficial effects of yoga CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents interventions on depressive disorders . Variation in interventions, severity and reporting of trial methodology suggests that the findings must be interpreted with caution. Several of the interventions may not be feasible in those with reduced or impaired mobility. Nevertheless, further investigation of yoga as a therapeutic intervention is warranted.\"9 In 2007, a team from Harvard and Boston University led by Chris Streeter, M.D. (of B.U.), conducted a pilot \"open -label\" study of eight experienced yoga practitioners practicing the Ashtanga, Bikram, Iyengar, Kripalu, Kundalini, Power and Vinyasa forms of yoga. The yoga practitioners were evaluated against a group of 11 people who read popular magazines and fiction. The control group experienced no changes on gamma - aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels (a neurotransmitter implicated in depression). In contrast, the brains of the yoga practitioners showed an average GABA rise of 27%, with more experienced practitioners showing greater rises, up to 80% in one case .10 Streeter asserted: \"I am quite sure that this is the first study that's shown that there's a real, measurable change in a major neurotransmitter with a behavioral i ntervention such as yoga.\"11 The ABC news article quoting Streeter demonstrates the controversy about the importance of GABA, which is seen by some as a minor neurotransmitter compared to dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenalin), histamine by Streeter, Gerbarg, Saper, Ciraulo & Brown, in the review cited in endnote 5. The Streeter and colleagues study is cited with approval in Broad's 2012 book, The Science of Yoga: The Risks and the Rewards .12 Broad stresses that despite the lack of randomized, double -blind studies, \"Many people have looked to t heir own experience on such matters and found that, overall, yoga lifts their emotional life.\"13 Amy Weintraub's book, Yoga for Depression: A Compassionate Guide to Relieve Suffering through Yoga (Norton, New York 2012), is recommended by Brown, Gerbarg and Broad, and may be consulted for specific yoga techniques helpful in coping with depression.14 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents The 2005 Lavey et al. 113-subject open -label trial showed the potential efficacy of yoga in improving the mood of psychiatric inpatients.15 Participants completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) prior to and following participation in a yoga class (45 minutes, once a week). Analyses indicated that participants reported significant improvements on all five of the negative emotion factors on the POMS, including ten sion-anxiety, depression -dejection, anger -hostility, fatigue -inertia, and confusion -bewilderment. There was no significant change on the sixth POMS factor, vigor -activity. Improvements in mood were not related to gender or diagnosis. The abstract concluded : \"The results suggest that yoga was associated with improved mood, and may be a useful way of reducing stress during inpatient psychiatric treatment .\"16 13. SCHIZOPHRENIA Similarly, Yoga has been used to lessen the effects of schizophrenia . In a 2007 randomiz ed, observer -blind trial cited with approval by Brown and Gerbarg, over 4 months, subjects in the yoga group had significantly less psychopathology than those in the physical training (exercise) group at the end of four months. They also had significantly greater social and occupational functioning and quality of life. Subjects in the yoga group significantly improved in negative symptoms (p= 0.001) and socio - occupational functioning (p = 0.006) over the physical training group, without significant differen ces in positive symptoms and depression scores.17 The exercise group improved less. 13. ANXIETY AND PTSD van der Kolk, who founded The Trauma Center in Brookline, MA, has reported dramatic results in the use of yoga for treatment of PTSD: \"People with PTSD los e their way in the world. Their bodies continue to live in an internal environment of the trauma. We all are biologically and neurologically programmed to deal with emergencies, but time stops in people CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents who suffer from PTSD. That makes it hard to take plea sure in the present because the body keeps replaying the past. If you practice Yoga and can develop a body that is strong and feels comfortable, this can contribute substantially to help you to come into the present.\"18 Appropriately taught yoga and other m ind-body relaxation techniques appear to reduce stress and PTSD. A 2004 open -label Albanian study of Kosovo refugees showed the effectiveness of an eight -week mind -body skills program that included meditation, biofeedback, movement, guided imagery, breathi ng techniques, autogenic training, psycho -education about stress, and group discussions of their experiences. Scores on an Albanian version of the PTSD Reaction Index were significantly reduced after the skill program and remained reduced at the nine - and 15-month follow ups .19 Four small 2004 Australian open -label studies of Iyengar Yoga provided to Vietnam veterans with longstanding diagnoses of PTSD showed that the postures improved depression scores, but: \" the addition of yoga breathing (particularly Uj jayi) and Ham Su meditation significantly reduced symptoms of PTSD, including anxiety, insomnia, flashbacks, and anger outbursts .\"20 An unpublished 2005 Australian single -blind (the rater was ignorant of the subjects' treatment or wait list status), randomi zed, wait list -controlled study of a five -day course of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (in which Brown and Gerbarg participated, and that was cited with approval by Broad) showed a significant reduction in the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for the yoga group over the wait list group (p = 0.007).21 In a 2011 review, Gerbarg and Brown with Wallace examined the \"evidence and insights\" from a series of mass disaster interventions. Reviewing Gordon's experience treating PTSD in Kosovo, Gaza and Israel, and in American veterans, and Gerbarg's and others' studies of flood victims in Bihar and after the Asian Tsunami, genocide in Rwanda and Sudan, and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Gerbarg, Wallace and Brown concluded that, \" mind -body practices have been shown to reduce sym ptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD in survivors of mass disasters .\"22 CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents \"When designed to accommodate local cultural traditions, the nature of the trauma, and long -term sustainability,\" Gerbarg and colleagues concluded, \" mind -body programs can meet the urg ent need for immediate psychological relief post -disaster as well as during the recovery years...[Survivors participating in such programs] forge bonds within their community to solve problems collectively, rather than resorting to violence for self-preserva tion. Mind -body practices not only serve disaster survivors but also provide tools to ameliorate the stress of trauma exposure among service providers. As safe, simple, adaptable, and cost -effective interventions, mind -body techniques support individual an d community -wide wellness, essential for healing and reconstruction post - disaster.\"23 In a 2012 study, Katzman et al. tested a multi -component, yoga -based, breath intervention program as an open -label adjunctive treatment in people suffering from severe, tr eatment -resistant generalized anxiety disorder. Significant reductions occurred in the pre - and post -intervention mean HAM -A total score (t=4.59; P<0.01) and psychic subscale (t=5.00; P0.01). The response rate was 73% (21 out of 29 subjects, defined as a decrease 50% on the HAM -A) and remission rate of 41% (12 out of 29 subjects, defined as a HAM -A score 7).24 8. ADHD Brown and Gerbarg's 2012 book on ADHD review s Jensen and Kenny's open -label study, Haffner, Roos, Goldstein, Parzer,and Resch's randomized 2006 study and the YES! studies still in process, that showed the effectiveness of a program of yoga breathing, yoga postures, meditation, and interactive discussion and group proce sses on Identity Conflict Resolution, Self Esteem, and the Modified Anger Coping, Planning and Concentration Scale, Distractibility Scale, and Irritability Scale.25 They conclude that \"while additional studies are needed, encouraging preliminary data suppor t the use of yoga, a low -risk intervention, as an adjunctive treatment for ADHD .\" CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents 9. FACILITATE PSYCHOTHERAPY: Brown et al . describe six ways that yoga, in addition to reducing stress and promoting healing, can facilitate psychotherapy: When people in treatm ent acquire tools like yoga for reducing anxiety, they are better able to tolerate the painful memories and emotions that arise during therapy sessions as well as in their outside daily life. Yoga philosophy and techniques are compatible with most psychoth erapeutic approaches in that they teach nonjudgmental awareness and dispassionate observation of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. By practicing yoga, people learn how to observe themselves, how to direct their attention, and how to shift their awareness between experiencing emotions and observing from a safe distance. If treatment has been blocked by emotional numbing, repression, suppression, denial, dissociation, or isolation of affect, yoga can sometimes move the treatment forward. Yoga can \"improve c ognitive -emotional integration\" and bring unconscious content into consciousness. Introducing mind -body techniques can strengthen the therapeutic alliance by empowering the individual to deal directly with stress and reducing dependence on the therapist or medication. It is an essential building block of recovery to use tools like yoga and meditation to support development of mastery and independence. As a person engages in yoga practices, greater awareness, access to memories, and new insights often emerg e. The therapist can use this material and validate the person under treatment in an active and collaborative rather than passive or inferior role in the process.26 7. SIDE EFFECTS AND DRUG INTERACTIONS Brown et al . caution that some physical conditions limit practicing yoga and other mind - body techniques. Pregnancy, uncontrolled hypertension, a recent heart attack or serious heart disease, seizure disorders, migraine headaches, chronic obstructive pulmonary CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents disorder (COPD), asthma, and physical injuries are a ll contraindications for rapid or forceful yoga breathing. They recommend slow, gentle yoga breathing practices as being both safe and effective. Physical injuries and disabilities may limit the asanas (postures) that can be practiced or sustained and will require more careful preparation and practice. A skilled and sensitive teacher is important to avoid injury and make progress. People with bipolar disorder may be triggered to become manic, particularly from Bhastrika, Kapalabhati, Kundalini, or rapid -cycle breathing. Even slow Ujjayi or alternate nostril breathing may induce mania in some people.27 Brown et al . state that yoga can be useful in treating bipolar conditions if the people under treatment can learn to slow down their breath rate whenever the y notice themselves becoming agitated, with the help of an appropriate teacher. Because rapid yoga breathing can lower serum lithium levels, people being treated with lithium alone should not attempt it. People taking lithium with other mood stabilizers should be sure that their lithium levels are checked and adjusted to take into account any effects from rapid yoga breathing.28 Severe character disorders and psychosis may make group yoga practice inadvisable, and rapid yoga breathing can be abused by peopl e experiencing psychotic states seeking to further alter their consciousness. It is better to avoid yoga if the mental health condition is that severe. However, as cited above, careful yoga techniques have been shown to help in reducing stress during inpat ient psychiatric treatment and lessening the effects of schizophrenia. A skilled practitioner can be helpful in setting a pace and scope of yoga practice suited to the individual. Brown et al . state that anxiety disorders and post -traumatic stress disorder can respond to yoga breathing if the person undergoing the treatment is well -prepared and sensitively coached. At pp. 110 -111, they give detailed recommendations to avoid triggering a panic attack and to assist in recovery if needed. Obviously, this requi res special training and sensitivity on the part of the yoga instructor. CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents MEDITATION 8. Meditation is even more difficult to evaluate since the definition is extremely diffuse, and in principle it can aid in coping with any stressful mental health condition. All meditation disciplines make spiritual claims, and some emphasize meditation as a way of coping with suffering, but Transcendental Meditation (\"TM\") makes extensive scientific claims on the web, claiming that, \" [s]tudies have found that the TM technique reduces anxiety, depression, and even symptoms of post -traumatic stress disorder.... 9. Over 600 research studies on TM indicate the positive effects of this stress reducing technique, for example: Faster recovery from stress Decreased anxiety and insomnia Reduced substance abuse Decreased depression Reduction in high blood pressure\"29 10. The 20 studies cited for TM's efficacy in treating mental health conditions are all at least 13 years old, often not fully randomized and suffer from other methodological conce rns common with studies of mind -body CAM techniques, but are certainly suggestive. See http://www.tm.org/research -on-meditation 11. A 2006 Cochrane Collaboration review determined that the small numbe r of reliable TM studies do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the efficacy of meditation therapy in reducing anxiety , except that TM is comparable to other relaxation therapies.30 12. The Dalai Lama has encouraged research in \"mindfulness and contemp lative neuroscience,\"31 through his Mind and Life Institute, http://www.mindandlife.org/ , and has a special interest in research focused on the origins and practice of compassion. His credo is CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents that empirical evide nce must triumph over scriptural authority, and that research can only reinforce the power of meditation. 13. These studies all bear watching, as the research proceeds. There is a dearth of research on the use of meditation for psychiatric diagnoses, but a br oad consensus that mindfulness can be very helpful in developing the \"emotional resilience\" to cope with depression.32 14. Berkeley Wellness recently summarized the meditation data: \"Subjecting meditation to scientific testing is a challenge. States of mind a re hard to measure. And other forms of relaxation training (for instance, progressive muscle relaxation, biofeedback, and stress management) may be just as useful. Still, research over the past 30 years suggests that mindfulness meditation may help in cond itions such as insomnia, chronic pain, psoriasis, fibromyalgia, and some psychiatric disorders. It has been shown to alter aspects of the immune, nervous, and endocrine system and produce changes in areas of the brain associated with memory, learning, and emotion. Research suggests it may be particularly useful in helping people adhere to medical treatment and cope with pain, as well as reduce anxiety and depression associated with illness. \" 33 15. Yoga and meditation are described separately in this outline, b ut it should be recognized that anxiety, stress and attention problems can interfere with a person's ability to meditate, and yoga and other physical disciplines, including exercise and other CAM treatments, can help bring about the relaxation response ach ieved through meditation. 16. SOFT BELLY: Gordon, whose 2008 comprehensive guide to alternative approaches to mental health care is called simply Unstuck , has a more mundane and secular approach. He calls therapeutic meditation \" soft belly .\" As described by Go rdon, soft belly is a biologically powerful concentrative meditation, grounded in slow, deep breathing. When you do soft CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents belly, you simply allow your belly to rise with the in breath and fall with the out breath, while you focus on the image of a soft, rel axed belly. According to Gordon, when your belly is soft, all of the other muscles in your body begin to relax as well. Thus, \"soft belly can help quiet the mental and physical agitation, the persistent fight -or-flight response, and the chronic stress, [as well as the] exhaustion, hopelessness, and self -condemnation, when we are depressed.\"34 17. In addition to TM, Gordon, whose book is a compendium of contemporary integrative medical approaches to mental health and substance use conditions, refers readers to numerous retreat opportunities, his own Center for Mind -Body Medicine, www.cmbm.org , and the following traditional meditation resources: The Independent Center Guide, www.g osit.org Osho/Rajneesh, www.osho.com 18. THE RELAXATION RESPONSE: Benson, of the Harvard Medical School, calls th is important technique for self -calming \" the relaxation response ,\" after his 1975 book of that title, and explains it on his website: CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents Steps to Elicit the Relaxation Response The following is the technique reprinted with permission from Dr. Herbert Benson's book, The Relaxation Response, pages 162 - 163 1. Sit quietly in a comfortable position. 2. Close your eyes . 3. Deeply relax all your muscles, beginning at your feet and progressing up to your face . Keep them relaxed. 4. Breathe through your nose. Become aware of your breathing. As you breathe out, say the word, \"one\"*, silently to yourself. For example, breathe in... out..., \"one\", in... out... \"one\", etc. Breathe easily and naturally. 5. Continue f or 10 to 20 minutes. You may open your eyes to check the time, but do not use an alarm. When you finish, sit quietly for several minutes, at first with your eyes closed and later with your eyes opened. Do not stand up for a few minutes. 6. Do not worry about whether you are successful in achieving a deep level of relaxation. Maintain a passive attitude and permit relaxation to occur at its own pace. When distracting thoughts occur, try to ignore them by not dwelling upon them and return to repeating \"one.\" Note: With practice, this response should come with little effort. Practice the technique once or twice daily, but not within two hours after any meal, since the digestive processes seem to interfere with the elicitation of the relaxation response . CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents * or any soothing, mellifluous sound, preferably with no meaning. or association, to avoid stimulation of unnecessary thoughts.35 19. Benson ushered in a new era of understanding in the field of mind -body medicine. Coining the term \"relaxation response,\" which the Mayo Clinic calls the \"rest and digest\" response, Benson identified the body's physiological reaction that is th e exact opposite of, and necessary complement to, the stress (fight -or-flight) response. This is a secular concept of meditation. In the four decades since that initial discovery, Benson and his colleagues have established a therapy to counteract the harmf ul effects of stress. They have explored how the relaxation response, the power of expectation and belief, and other mind -body phenomena can produce healing in your own body. Benson's studies of the relaxation response show that the core of meditational pr actices is the same, and that the pervasive stress of modern life can be counteracted by self -discipline and self -calming. 20. In Relaxation Revolution , Benson and Proctor contend that we have the ability to self -heal diseases, prevent life -threatening condit ions, and supplement established drug and surgical procedures with mind -body techniques. In a special \"treatment\" section, Benson and Proctor describe how these mind body techniques can be applied \u2014and are being applied \u2014 to treat a wide variety of conditions , including anxiety and depression. The proof will have to be weighed by others, and the jury is certainly out, but the lack of an identifiable risk of harm may make the question of efficacy moot. Relaxation certainly works for many people. 21. OPEN FOCUS: Similarly, Fehmi, developed the secular concept of \"open focus.\" During the 1970s Fehmi developed and recorded a series of exercises that involved imagining space in various contexts and successfully talked subjects into the synchronous -alpha state. The strong correlation between observed brain wave type (alpha, beta, theta) and the way the subject was attending became obvious. Was the mode of attending perhaps the CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents fundamentally important thing, with brain waves secondary? The Open -Focus Brain is Fehmi's affi rmative answer to that question.36 22. MINDFULNESS BASED STRESS REDUCTION (also called Mindfulness -Based Cognitive Therapy) : Starting in 1979, Kabat -Zinn37 developed the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program at the University of Massachusetts Medica l Center. MBSR brings together mindfulness meditation and yoga in an 8 -week intensive training that meets on a weekly basis. Mindfulness practice seeks to cultivate greater awareness of the unity of mind and body, as well as of the ways that unconscious th oughts, feelings, and behaviors can undermine emotional, physical, and spiritual health. The mind is known to be a factor in stress and stress -related disorders, and meditation has been shown to positively affect a range of autonomic physiological processe s, such as lowering blood pressure and reducing overall arousal and emotional reactivity. http://www.mbct.com/ 23. The MBSR program started in the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in 1979 and is now offered in over 200 medical centers, hospitals, and clinics around the world, including some of the leading integrative medical centers such as the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine, the Duke Center for Integrative Medicine, and th e Jefferson -Myrna Brind Center for Integrative Medicine. MBSR/MBCT work is based on an active partnership in a participatory form of medicine, one in which patient/clients take on significant responsibility for doing a certain kind of interior work in orde r to tap into their own deepest inner resources for learning, growing, healing, and transformation. 24. The National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine has provided a number of grants to research the efficacy of the MBSR program in promoting healing. Completed studies have found that activity levels and feelings of self esteem increased for a majority of participants. For more information on these studies, see http://www.umassmed.edu/Content.aspx?id=41286 . Recent studies have validated MBSR/MBCT for prevention of relapses in recurrent depression, equivalent to CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents antidepressant therapy.38 One recent MBSR study showed greater gray matter concentration for me ditators in the right anterior insula and in the left inferior temporal gyrus and right hippocampus.39 25. Similarly, the 2005 Lazar et al . study cited by Gordon and Benson was a breakthrough, in that it found that a portion of the cerebral cortex of \"regular meditators\" (engaged in Buddhist -inspired Insight Meditation, http://www.dharma.org/ ) was thicker than those of the control group .40 The abstract expands on the potential significance of the findings: \"Previous researc h indicates that long -term meditation practice is associated with altered resting electroencephalogram patterns, suggestive of long lasting changes in brain activity. We hypothesized that meditation practice might also be associated with changes in the bra in's physical structure. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess cortical thickness in 20 participants with extensive Insight meditation experience, which involves focused attention to internal experiences. Brain regions associated with attention, in terception [perception of sensations from inside the body] and sensory processing were thicker in meditation participants than matched controls, including the prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula. Between -group differences in prefrontal cortical thi ckness were most pronounced in older participants, suggesting that meditation might offset age -related cortical thinning. Finally, the thickness of two regions correlated with meditation experience. These data provide the first structural evidence for expe rience -dependent cortical plasticity associated with meditation practice. \"41 26. Weil expresses this same radical thought in asserting that \"learning to change our ways of thinking and perceiving can actually change the function and structure of our brains.\"42 In integrative medicine, the brain is not primary, as it has become under the medical model. The mind can heal the brain. 27. No side effects of meditation have been documented, but lack of skill could cause increased anxiety and is certain to result in bored om and discontinuation of meditation practice. As CAM and Mental Health Return to Table of Contents with yoga, the help of an insightful and cheerful guide(s) and of supportive companions on the way is helpful if not, for most of us, essential. 1 For a recent Berkeley Wellness review of the benefits of Tai Chi, see http://www.berkeleywellnessalerts.com/alerts/womens_health/tai -chi-health -benefits443 - 1.html?ET=bwalerts:e1502:143685a:&st=em ail&s=ERA_120811_001 A new study, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease , included 120 healthy older people in China. Those who practiced tai chi three times a week for 40 weeks showed increases in brain volume, as seen on MRI, as well as improv ements on several tests of memory and learning, compared to those not doing the exercise who had normal age -related brain shrinkage. Previous research has shown that aerobic activity is good for the brain, but this study suggests that a more gentle form of exercise is also beneficial. 2 See recent fibromyalgia trial, http://nqa.org/2012/08/a -randomized -controlled -trial-of-qigong -for-fibromyalgia/ 3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_martial_arts . 4 Weil, A., Spontaneous Happiness (Little, Brown and Company, New York 2011), at 146-147. 5 Gerbarg practices integrative psychiatry, combining standar d and complementary treatments. Her research focuses on mind -body practices for reducing the effects of stress and trauma, particularly in survivors of mass disasters, including the Asian Tsunami, 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, 2010 earthquake in Haiti, genocide in Sudan and Rwanda, Gulf Horizon Oil Spill, and veterans. 6 Streeter, C.C., Gerbarg, P.L., Saper, R.B., Ciraulo, D.A. of Yoga on the Autonomic Nervous System, Gamma -Aminobutyric Acid, and Allostasis in Epilepsy, Depressio n, and PTSD,\" Medical Hypotheses (2012) doi:10.1016/j.mehy.2012.01.021. 7 Hatha Yoga may be viewed as a subdivision of Raja Yoga, which is the yoga system that most emphasizes meditation. Of the Eight Limbs of Raja Yoga, the two limbs that are emphasized i n Hatha Yoga are (3) Asana & (4) Pranayama. Hatha Yoga was intended as a practice to lead one eventually to be fit to practice Raja Yoga. This is clearly stated in the 1st verse of the Hatha Yoga Pradipika. While it is true that when we say the word \"yoga\" in the US, we mean Hatha Yoga, Hatha is a much more recent (not so ancient) way of practicing Yoga. Its spiritual and moral practices are emphasized in Raja Yoga. 8 Pilkington, K., Kirkwood, G., Rampes, H. & Richardson, J., \"Yoga J Epub (2005). 9 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/161857 70 .
