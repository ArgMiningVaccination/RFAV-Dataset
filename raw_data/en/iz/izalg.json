There are some 20,000 radiation satellites orbiting the planet and 5G towers being installed around the globe . . . interestingly, the first and most 5G saturated city was Wuhan, China, just months before the Coronavirus outbreak in that city. So, I think it's time for me to weigh in on the conversation, as it's about energy and vibrations, the field in which I have worked for half-a-century as a holistic healthcare practitioner, albeit now an elder in retirement, though still very much engaged in vibrational healing with remote distance attunement using sacred sound currents as carrier waves for Spirit and intention.](https://liftingtones.com/2021/10/11/the-price-of-fear-and-vaccine-mandates/my-chorale-pic-2/) Not being a diplomat, I will cut right to the chase with what I want to convey in this bog post\u2014not to engender fear but simply to look squarely at the factual energetic state of our world and the current chaotic human experience of life on Earth . . . and hopefully lead to a path forward. That said, I received this intriguing comment on my previous post [\"Where's the Virus?!\"](https://liftingtones.com/2021/10/24/wheres-the-virus/) from a longtime friend and colleague in the field of sound healing, Deborah Statnekov: According to Rudolph Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, and as described by Dr. Tom Cowan, a virus is an excretion of a cell which has become poisoned. From their perspective, a virus is not the cause of an illness, but merely a symptom. Anthroposophy understands the cause of illness to be a disturbance in the electrical equilibrium of the body which points to the connection between 5G and \"viruses.\" Anthroposophy is defined as \"A formal educational, therapeutic, and creative system established by Rudolf Steiner, seeking to use mainly natural means to optimize physical and mental health and well-being.\" I would define holistic healthcare with nearly the exact wording . . . and include \"energy healing,\" such as sound healing and energy work as put forward by Reiki and spirit-based Attunement practitioners. A more esoteric and useful definition of Anthroposophy useful to the theme of this post is found on Wikipedia: \"A philosophy founded in the early 20th century, by the esoteric Rudolf Steiner that postulates the existence of an objective, intellectually comprehensible spiritual world, accessible to human experience.\" We can substitute the word \"spiritual\" with \"vibrational,\" as clearly demonstrated in the science of Cymatics, with which most of my readers, if not all, are likely familiar. Cymatics is a type of vibrational bioenergetics medicine developed by British osteopath, Peter Guy Manners, who in the 1940s began work with a team of scientists and medical doctors investigating the biosignatures of the human body. I was born 1940 and am quite aware of this technology being central to my life's work as an energy healer. So, a big posthumous \"Thank You!\" to Dr. Manners. Cymatic therapy is a form of sound therapy. Cymatics refers to the effect of sound waves on matter, and cymatic therapy presumes that sound can have similar effects on the body. Sound is capable of rearranging the structure of molecules, and therefore has unlimited potential as a tool for healing. Watch what happens when sound vibration impacts matter to create beautiful patterns of sacred geometry, as this enlightening video demonstrates: \"What you get out is what you put in.\" Disturbing thoughts and feelings, like sound vibration, will create patterns of dis-ease and chaos, as this video demonstrates. ORGANIZED COHERENT WATER Do you feel that way at times, like your brain is being scrambled? Our physical bodies are comprised of some 85% water, which fact makes them extremely impressionable to vibrations of all kinds. The metaphorical \"Pluck a flower and disturb a star\" speaks to the vibrational impact our every motion, the essential basis of vibrations, has on our environment. I would next like to take you on a journey inside your body's aqueous cellular composition as graphically and dramatically portrayed by Dr. Thomas Cowan, MD via this video. It's lengthy, so you can skip forward to 1:10.00 minutes for an amazing explanation of the mRNA spike protein vaccine, and how the tissues of our cellular anatomy are made of \"organized coherent water.\" He's absolutely entertaining and clarifying. When you have the time, the entire 90 minute presentation is most interesting and informative, well worth your time. The topic of his presentation is \"Contagion\" and how it occurs, if you're interested. [The Contagion Myth ](https://www.bitchute.com/video/iL8lUrarkOg0/)with Dr. Tomas Cowan 5G RADIATION Finally, and to the chief message of this post, Dr. Cowan addresses the G5 issue in a most eye-opening presentation of the vibrational terrain of all pandemics. You will be enlightened I promise you. Watch and listen to this ten-minute video, which I will introduce with these words of Rudolf Steiner when he was asked what the Spanish Flu of 1918 was all about. His answer, as paraphrased and augmented by Dr. Cowan, was: Well, viruses are simply the excretions of toxic cells . . . . They happen when the cell is poisoned. They are not the cause of anything. . . . We are electrical beings and the chemicals are only the products of those electrical impulses.\" Here's [Dr. Thomas Cowan](https://youtu.be/MRovg9t7hj4) As a segue to my next post, I will close and leave you to ponder more wisdom from the pen of Rudolf Steiner, which point to a spiritual path through these turbulent times and forward to a new experience of life in God's Creating Universe: In times when there were no electrical currents, when the air was not swarming around with electrical influences (1917), it was easier to be human. For this reason, in order to be at all human, it is necessary to expend much stronger spiritual capacity than was necessary a century ago. My next post will feature \"The Unified Field\" and will initiate a series of exploratory considerations into the vibrational context of our existence and creativity within and as one with The Field of Universal Oneness.\" Stay tuned . . . and thank you for being with me as we explore the possibilities of a New Earth. As always, I welcome your thoughts on these considerations. Until my next post, here's to your health and joy in life. "}
