Department of Geological Scienceswww.indiana.edu/~geosci/ Master of Science in Environmental Science-Master of Arts in Journalism(M.S.E.S.-M.A.) School of Journalismwww.journalism.indiana.edu/ Master of Arts in Arts Administration(M.A.) Program Goals and Objectives Arts administrators are extraordinary individuals. They must function as managers, fundraisers,planners, educators, conciliators, facilitators,communicators, and most important, as leaders.They must be realists as well as idealists,respectful of the needs of both art and business,and forward-looking yet mindful of the past. Since 1971 the Indiana University Arts Administration Program has been committed tothe development of such leaders. The program,a 16-month, multidisciplinary course of studyleading to an M.A. in Arts Administration, is broad-based in outlook and curriculum andstrives to achieve a balance of artistic andmanagement concerns, theory and hands-onexperience. Students complete three semestersof course work, on-campus practicums, and asupervised internship off campus. The programseeks to serve students who are at the beginningstages of their careers as well as older studentswishing to change careers. Though small in size, the City of Bloomington provides an ideal setting for the program. Thecity's thriving arts community includes morethan 150 arts organizations as well as theinternationally acclaimed Lotus World Music andArts Festival. On the IU Bloomington campus,the School of Music presents more than 1,000concerts and events each year, and a newproduction opens almost every other week onone of the two stages in the Department ofTheatre and Drama. Other cultural organizationson campus include the IU Auditorium, whichoffers touring Broadway productions; the IU ArtMuseum, one of the nation's finest university artmuseums; the Mathers Museum of WorldCultures; the African American Arts Institute; theArchives of Traditional Music; and the LillyLibrary of rare books and manuscripts. Administration of the Program The program is administered by a full-time director and also utilizes an advisory committee,faculty drawn from fine arts, music, theatre anddrama, SPEA, business, anthropology/museumstudies, and the African American Arts Institute. Degree Requirements (45 credit hours) The program requires 45 credit hours of course work. A typical two-year course schedule includes15 credit hours the first semester and 12 credithours in the second semester. The third semesterof 12 credit hours includes the capstone seminarcourse. In the summer following the second semester of course work most students complete a sevenweek internship in an arts organization of theirchoice. These students are able to complete theirdegree in December of their second year of study.Some students opt to complete their internship inthe spring following their final fall semester ofcourse work. Recent sites have included CarnegieHall, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, theSmithsonian, the Museum of Fine Arts-Houston,the Seattle International Film Festival, theIndianapolis Museum of Art, the Abrons ArtCenter, and the Barrier Island Group for the Arts(BIG ARTS) on Sanibel Island. While there is nothesis requirement, extensive writing projects arepart of the capstone seminar course andinternship experiences.

Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) inEnvironmentalScience This doctoral program is administered by the School of Public and Environmental Affairs incooperation with the Departments of Biology,Chemistry, Geography, and Geological Sciences.The Ph.D. in environmental science degree isawarded by the University Graduate School. The program provides a rigorous, comprehensive education in environmental science. The specificobjectives of the program are: (1) to conductadvanced research and scientific analysis ofenvironmental events, issues, and problems; (2) tofurther understanding of the nature andmanagement of natural and human environments;and (3) to provide an opportunity for students andfaculty members in several departments to engagein collaborative environmental research in aninterdisciplinary mode. Admission A student must apply to the School of Public andEnvironmental Affairs for doctoral studies; thoseaccepted will be recommended to the UniversityGraduate School for formal admission into thePh.D. program. Applicants to this program musthave completed at least a bachelor's degree inscience, mathematics, engineering, or a relatedfield. Prospective students are required tosubmit: (1) a statement of purpose, whichshould be as specific as possible and, preferably,should refer to potential research mentors byname; (2) official results of the Graduate RecordExaminations (GRE); (3) official transcripts of allundergraduate and graduate course workcompleted; and (4) three letters ofrecommendation. Applicants whose nativelanguage is not English must also submit resultsof the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Degree Requirements The degree requires: (1) substantial knowledgein a primary environmental scienceconcentration; (2) breadth in relatedenvironmental science and policy; (3) anunderstanding of research methods; (4) an in-depth knowledge of the dissertation topic; and(5) a dissertation that demonstrates thestudent's ability to analyze, explain, and interpretresearch clearly and effectively. Advisory Committee During the first semester of enrollment, each student mustorganize an advisory committee. Normally thiscommittee consists of at least four facultymembers: at least two should be from theSchool of Public and Environmental Affairs; theothers may be from other departments or fromoutside the university. Membership of theadvisory committee is approved by the directorof the Doctoral Program in EnvironmentalScience and the dean of the University GraduateSchool. At least three members of the advisorycommittee must be full members of the graduatefaculty. Fields of Study Each student should define a principal field of study, which may beinterdisciplinary. The student should prepare aproposal outlining a program of course workthat the student believes lies within thatprincipal field. Each student should also prepare a program of course work that fulfills the requirement ofbreadth in environmental science and policy.The breadth requirement may be fulfilled byusing a wide spectrum of environmentallyrelated courses, including areas such aseconomics, law, and management, in addition toother science courses. Each student should also prepare a statement of courses or activities for meeting the researchmethods requirement. Normally these includesubjects such as computer science, geographicinformation systems, remote sensing, statistics,and mathematical modeling, although othertechnical skill areas such as electronics andanalytical chemical techniques may beappropriate for some students. Narrative Statement Each student must prepare a narrative statement that includes adiscussion of the student's previous educationalexperiences, a statement of career objectives, astatement of research interests, and a proposedprogram of course work. Each student must submit the narrative statement to the advisory committee forapproval, usually during the first semester in theprogram. Course Requirements The exact nature and amount of course work in each of the threeareas\u2014principal field of study, breadth inenvironmental science and policy, and researchmethods\u2014is determined by the advisorycommittee after review and approval of thestudent's proposed plan of study in each ofthese areas. Selection of specific courses is based on obtaining (1) adequate knowledge forqualifying examinations, (2) appropriatepreparation for a research project, and (3) amixture of courses that meets the individualprofessional goals of the student. The Ph.D. degree requires the completion of at least 90 credit hours in advanced study andresearch beyond the bachelor's degree.Astudent must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of advanced course work inenvironmental science and policy. Students mustalso complete a minimum of 30 credit hours ofresearch, normally taken as SPEA-E 625 or SPEA-E 890. The student, with the approval of theadvisory committee, should complete somecombination of additional course work andresearch sufficient to meet the 90 credit hourrequirement. Each student is required to enroll in SPEA-E 680 Seminar in Environmental Science and Policy(1 credit hour/semester) for four semestersduring their degree program. Students enrolledin SPEA-E 680 may either make a formalpresentation or write a brief synopsis andcritique of four presentations attended eachsemester. Students are encouraged to enroll inSPEA-E 710 Advanced Topics in EnvironmentalScience, which may be taken multiple times asthe topics will vary. Advanced topics and readingcourses may be used to meet requirements,depending upon the topic and the student's areaof interest. Students should note that 30 credit hours of advanced course work, if properly selected, and6 credit hours of research, may be appliedtoward the Master of Science in EnvironmentalScience (M.S.E.S.) degree. With an additional 12credit hours of approved course work, a studentmay be awarded the M.S.E.S. degree whilecompleting the requirements for the Ph.D. inenvironmental science. Completion of theM.S.E.S. degree as part of this doctoral programis not a requirement; however, this option maybe appropriate for some students. Qualifying Examinations Before a student is admitted to candidacy, all requirementsdetermined by the advisory committee must bemet and the qualifying examinations passed. Astudent who fails qualifying examinations mayretake them only once. The decision to admit a student to doctoral candidacy is made by the advisory committee,which evaluates the student's performance inthe written examination, research proposal, andoral examination. Written Examination This examination should be taken by the end of a student's fifthsemester in the Ph.D. program. The examfocuses on topics covered by the student'scourse work and related to the student'sresearch interests. The examination is writtenand graded by the student's advisory committee.The written examination is graded as pass,conditional pass, or fail. Research Proposal No later than the end of the fifth semester, the student should submit awritten research proposal for review by the advisory committee. The proposal should bedocumented, clearly stating a research objective,the approach to be taken, and the significance ofthe work. Oral Examination Each candidate is examined orally by the advisory committee. Theoral examination expands upon the writtenexamination and covers the student's researchproposal. Research Committee Upon the student's successful completion of the qualifyingexamination, a research committee is formed.Normally this committee consists of at least fourfaculty members: at least two should be from theSchool of Public and Environmental Affairs; theothers may be from other departments. Thedirector of the Doctoral Program inEnvironmental Science recommends thestudent's research committee to the dean of theUniversity Graduate School. At least threemembers of the research committee must be fullmembers of the graduate faculty. Dissertation A dissertation is required and must be of sufficient value to warrant publication. Thedissertation must represent a substantial researcheffort, both in quality and quantity. Thedissertation requirement may be met by preparinga traditional dissertation or by preparing aportfolio of research documents includingpublications, manuscripts in press, and completedmanuscripts suitable for submission to a journal.These documents may have multiple authors,although the doctoral candidate must demonstratethat he or she made significant contributions to atleast two of the publications or manuscriptssubmitted for review. The research portfolio musthave introductory and concluding chapters tointegrate across the topics. The research portfolioalso must be prepared to meet the UniversityGraduate School's requirements for dissertations.A public presentation of the dissertation researchis required. The dissertation must be approved bythe research committee. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in PublicAffairs The Doctoral Program in Public Affairs was created to take advantage of the uniquestrengths of SPEA's interdisciplinary faculty andresearch programs, both of which have earnedwide recognition from peer institutions, nationaland international agencies, and professionalgroups. The curriculum equips students with thenecessary skills for independent research andanalysis of problems, issues, and solutions ingovernment and the nonprofit sector in fourmajor fields:1. Public Finance: the theory and practice of fiscal administration, including publicbudgeting, revenue administration, andfinancial management; 2. Public Management: the design and operation of government institutions,including strategic/operations managementPh.D. in Environmental Science/Ph.D. in Public Affairs \u2014Bloomington 17and interrelationships between public and private organizations; 3. Public Policy Analysis: research methods and quantitative techniques for policy analysis,including the content, design, and evaluationof public programs; and 4. Environmental Policy: the study of and contribution to public policies that affect theenvironment, both domestic andinternational, including legal, economic, andother policy tools and approaches. Instead of being grounded in a traditional academic discipline, each of the fields hasdeveloped from several theoretical literaturesapplied to real-world public affairs problems.Although research is grounded in the socialsciences, the context of inquiry reverses thenormal research process. Instead of beginningwith questions originating in discipline-basedscholarship, the research process begins withpublic problems and issues. The researchchallenge, then, is to match available tools ofinquiry to the research opportunities presentedby problems. Admission Students apply directly to the School of Publicand Environmental Affairs; those accepted arerecommended to the University Graduate Schoolfor formal admission into the Ph.D. program.Application materials can be found atwww.gradapp.indiana.edu/. Applicants to this program must have completed at least abachelor's degree. Prospective students arerequired to submit (1) a statement of purpose,which should be as specific as possible and,preferably, should refer to potential researchmentors by name; (2) official results of theGraduate Record Examinations (GRE); (3) officialtranscripts of all undergraduate and graduatework completed; and (4) three letters ofrecommendation. Applicants whose nativelanguage is not English must also submit resultsof the Test of English as a Foreign Language(TOEFL). Degree Requirements The Ph.D. in Public Affairs degree requires thecompletion of at least 90 credit hous in advancedstudy and research beyond the baccalaureate.Typically, one-half to two-thirds of the 90 credithours are taken in formal course work and one-third in thesis credit. Students completing aMaster of Public Affairs or similar degree may beallowed to transfer some of their graduatecourse work (30 hours maximum) if approved bytheir Progress Review Committees, though aprior master's degree is not required foradmission. Core Requirements The following three courses are required for allPublic Affairs students: SPEA-V 680 Research Design and Methods in Public Affairs (3 cr.) SPEA-V 621 Seminar in Teaching Public and Environmental Affairs (3 cr.) This course prepares students for college teaching and their professional responsibilitiestoward current and future students. It is taken in a student's first year in the program: SPEA-V 691 Workshop in Public Policy. Each student is required to take this 1 credit hour course for three semesters. The workshopfeatures research presentations by faculty,visiting scholars, and advanced students. Itsintent is to prepare students to critique currentliterature in the field, learn to preparemanuscripts for presentation and publication,and defend their ideas and theories. Research Tool Skills Required research skills include a two-semesterquantitative analysis sequence and two additionalelective courses or proficiency in a foreignlanguage. The two-semester quantitative analysis sequence can be fulfilled a number of different ways,including one of the sequences listed below. SPEA-V 606 Statistics for Research in Public Affairs I (3 cr.) and SPEA-V 607 Statistics for Research in Public Affairs II BUS-G 651 Econometric Methods in Business I (3 cr.) and BUS-G 652 Econometric Methods in Business II (3 cr.) ECON-E 572 Statistical Techniques in Economics II (3 cr.) and ECON-E 671 Econometrics I (3 cr.) POLS-Y 576 Political Data Analysis II (3 cr.) and POLS-Y 577 Advanced Topics in Political Science (3 cr.) SOC-S 554 Statistical Techniques in Sociology I (3 cr.) and SOC-S 650 Stastical Techniques in Sociology II (3 cr.) In addition, students must demonstrate either (1) advanced proficiency in quantitative analysisor specialized research skills by completing twoadditional courses approved by the student'sProgress Review Committee or (2) proficiency ina language proficiency exam from theappropriate language department at IndianaUniversity. Major Fields Students select two of the four SPEA PublicAffairs major fields to prepare for their qualifyingexaminations. For each field, the student mustcomplete required courses and approvedelectives. The fields and the required coursesare: Public Management The design and operation of government and not-for-profitinstitutions, including strategic/operationsmanagement and interrelationships betweenpublic, private, and civil society organizations. Required courses: SPEA-V 671 Public Organization and Management I (3 cr.) SPEA-V 672 Public Organization and Management II (3 cr.) Public Finance The theory and practice of fiscal administration, including public budgeting,revenue administration, and financial management. Required courses: SPEA-V 666 Public Revenue (3 cr.)SPEA-V 668 Seminar in Public Budgeting (3 cr.) Public Policy Analysis Research methods and quantitative techniques for policy analysis,including the content, design, and evaluation ofpublic programs. Required courses: SPEA-V 664 Seminar in Policy Analysis (3 cr.)SPEA-V 673 Public Policy Analysis and Management Science/Operations Research (3 cr.) Environmental Policy Economics, law, politics, and implementation of environmentalpolicies in the United States and abroad. Required courses: EconomicsSPEA-V 625 Environmental Economics (3 cr.) Law SPEA-V 645 Environmental Law (3 cr.) or LAW-B 783 International Environmental Law (3 cr.) Policy SPEA-V 710 Topics in Public Policy: Domestic Environmental Policy (3 cr.) or SPEA-V 710 Topics in Public Policy: International Environmental Policy (3 cr.) Minor Field Students select a minor field according to theirresearch interests. A three- to four-coursesequence is negotiated between the student andthe Progress Review Committee, following therequirements of the department or schooloffering the minor. Among the minor fieldschosen by students currently in the program areEconomics, Finance, Political Science, Sociology,Geography, Economic Development, andEnvironmental Science. Major Junctures Progress Review Committee Each student is assigned an advisor on arrival in Bloomington. If the advisor sufficiently reflects astudent's research interests, then the studentcan request that the advisor serve as chairpersonof the student's Progress Review Committee.The student may also select another professorwho is more suited to the student's researchinterests. At the end of the first year, the student develops a Progress Review Committee. The committee,in cooperation with the student, definesprogram objectives, supervises the selection andcompletion of the minor field, monitors overallprogress toward completion of course workrequirements, and administers the qualifyingexams. Members of the Progress ReviewCommittee should be scholars who know thestudent's academic record and who arerecognized experts in the fields in which thestudent will stand examination. The committeewill consist of four to five members chosen bythe student in consultation with the director of18 Ph.D. in Public Affairs\u2014BloomingtonPh.D. in Public Affairs/Ph.D. in Public Policy\u2014Bloomington 19 the Ph.D. program. At least one member of the Progress Review Committee will be chosen fromeach of the student's two major fields. It isrequired that one member of the ProgressReview Committee be a non-School professorand represent the outside minor. Third Semester Review During the third semester each student holds a third semester review meeting with the ProgressReview Committee. The purpose of the meetingis to reach an agreement between the studentand the committee about the character andstatus of the student's program. This meetingalso serves as a formal evaluation of thestudent's performance and prospects andincludes a presentation of a research paperprepared by the student. In this progress review meeting, the committee members review the student's record of past andplanned courses, the likely dissertation topic,and the quality of the research paper and itspresentation. The committee determineswhether the proposed program of courses willprepare the student for the examinations to betaken at the end of the course work as well asfor the dissertation. The principal objective of the research paper is to allow the faculty to judge whether the studenthas the ability to complete all requirements forthis research-oriented degree in a timely fashion.Thus, of most importance will be that the paperdemonstrates the student's ability to carry outreasonably independent research and write theresults in a well-reasoned and coherent fashion.The paper should also demonstrate that thestudent has a good command of the literature inthe area and has the ability to use appropriateresearch methods in carrying out the analysis. Itis anticipated that the progress review paper willbe a revision of a substantial research paperprepared to fulfill a requirement for a regularcourse. (The student can, however, submit anentirely new paper to fulfill this requirement.) Itshould be of a quality warranting presentation ata professional society meeting. Qualifying Examinations After completion of course work, students take a written exam in each of their two major fields.The examination committee may also require anoral examination at its discretion. If there is anexam requirement in the minor department,then the student must also complete a thirdexam. Once the examinations are successfullycompleted, the student is formally admitted tocandidacy. Dissertation After filing for candidacy status, the doctoral candidate forms a Research Committeeconsisting of at least four faculty members,including one representative of the candidate'sminor field. This committee may be but is notnecessarily identical to the Progress ReviewCommittee. The selection of ResearchCommittee members should reflect thedissertation topic and expertise of the facultychosen.The candidate prepares a dissertation proposal to present and defend in a meeting of theResearch Committee. The Research Committeeis ultimately responsible for determiningwhether the dissertation is acceptable. Placement The Ph.D. Office, the director of the program, and individual faculty members work hard toensure that graduates of the program are placedin academic or research organizations. Althoughthe Public Affairs program has been operationalonly since 1993, graduates have been verysuccessful recently in obtaining such positions.Recent placements include North Carolina StateUniversity, The Ohio State University, Universityof Colorado, Syracuse University, Brigham YoungUniversity, Iowa State University, the U.S.Department of Labor, National Taipei University,and Yonsei University in South Korea. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in PublicPolicy The Joint Ph.D. Program in Public Policy is a collaborative endeavor of the School of Publicand Environmental Affairs and the Departmentof Political Science. Its emphasis is on the broad field of public policy, concerning the environment of publicpolicy; the processes of policy formation,management, and implementation; and theanalysis and evaluation of policy outputs andresults. The institutional setting and design ofthe program offer a unique educationalopportunity. Students in the program receiverigorous social science training and gainknowledge of government decision-makingprocesses, problem-solving capabilities, and anunderstanding of the substantive aspects ofpublic problems and their effects on publicinstitutions. Admission All applicants to the public policy program aresubject to approval by a SPEA-Department ofPolitical Science joint admissions committee.Application materials can be found atwww.gradapp.indiana.edu/. Applicants for admission and for financial assistance arerequired to submit a statement of career goals,official results of the Graduate RecordExamination (GRE), official transcripts of allundergraduate and graduate work, and aminimum of three letters of recommendation.Students whose native language is not Englishalso must submit results of the Test of English asa Foreign Language (TOEFL). The Joint ProgramCommittee on Admissions and Financial Aidexamines each application closely to determinesuitability for the program. The committee looksbeyond the formal academic record, at theapplicant's demonstrated ability to pursueindependent study, language and research skilltraining, and maturity and experience.Degree Requirements The University Graduate School requiresdoctoral students to complete 90 credit hours ofgraduate credit. Typically, two-thirds of the 90credit hours are taken in formal course work andone-third in thesis credit. Students holding aMaster of Public Affairs or similar degree may beallowed to transfer some of their graduatecourse work (30 credit hours maximum) ifapproved by their Progress Review Committee. Core Requirements Public Policy students are required to completethe following courses: SPEA-V 680 Research Design and Methods in Public Affairs (3 cr.) or POLS-Y 570 Introduction to the Study of Politics (3 cr.) SPEA-V 690 Seminar in Public Policy Process (3 cr.) or POLS-Y 565 Public Administration, Law, and Policy: Approaches and Issues (3 cr.) This course is offered alternately each fall semester by SPEA (V 690) and the Department ofPolitical Science (Y 565). SPEA-V 691 Workshop in Public Policy (1 cr.)Each student is required to take this 1 credit hour course for three semesters. The workshopfeatures research presentations by faculty,visiting scholars, and advanced students. Itprepares students to critique current literature inthe field, to prepare manuscripts forpresentation and publication, and to defendtheir ideas and theories. There are two sectionsoffered: one by SPEA and the other by theWorkshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis. SPEA-V 621 Seminar in Teaching Public and Environmental Affairs (2 cr.) or POLS-Y 550 Political Science and Professional Development (1-3 cr.) These courses prepare students for college teaching and their professional responsibilitiestoward current and future students. They aretaken in a student's first year in the program. Research Tool Skills Required course work for research skills includesa basic two-semester statistics sequence and twoadditional elective courses or proficiency in aforeign language. Basic Tool Skills: The two-semester quantitative analysis sequencerequirement is generally fulfilled through one ofthe course sequences listed below. SPEA-V 606 Statistics for Research in Public Affairs I (3 cr.) and SPEA-V 607 Statistics for Research in Public Affairs II (3 cr.) POLS-Y 575 Political Data Analysis I (3 cr.) and POLS-Y 576 Political Data Analysis II (3 cr.) SOC-S 554 Statistical Techniques in Sociology I (3 cr.) and SOC-S 650 Statistical Techniques in Sociology II (3 cr.) Advanced Tool Skills: In addition, students must demonstrate either(1) advanced proficiency in quantitative analysisorspecialized research skills by completing two additional courses approved by the student'sProgress Review Committee or (2) proficiency ina language appropriate to his/her field of studyand approved by the Progress ReviewCommittee. To qualify as language proficient, astudent must take a language proficiency examfrom the appropriate language department atIndiana University. Fields of Concentration The School of Public and Environmental Affairsand the Department of Political Science shareequally in delivering public policy as the majorfield of preparation and specialization. Studentsin the Public Policy Program select twoconcentration areas\u2014one from SPEA and onefrom Political Science\u2014in addition to therequired concentration in public policy. These fields of concentration include the following: SPEA Political Science Environmental Policy American PoliticsPublic Management Comparative PoliticsPublic Finance International RelationsPolicy Analysis Political Philosophy Political Theory and Methodology Course offerings in SPEA and Political Science help the student prepare for examinations inthese fields, and students supplement theircourse work with directed readings andresearch. There is no predetermined set ofcourses required of all students. Courseselection is the responsibility of the student,working in conjunction with his or her ProgressReview Committee. Major Junctures Progress Review CommitteeThe Progress Review Committee consists of fromfour to six faculty members. Two SPEA facultymust be selected for the SPEA concentration andtwo Political Science faculty for the PoliticalScience concentration. For the shared publicpolicy concentration, there must be one SPEAand one Political Science faculty member. Onefaculty member is chosen by the student to actas the chair of the committee. The chairpersonserves as the student's mentor and guides thestudent through the Progress Review andqualifying examination process. Before the meeting of the Progress Review Committee, the student develops a ProgressReview Statement. The statement needs toinclude background professional and educationalinformation, course work completed andplanned in each concentration and for basic andadvanced tool skills, tentative dates for takingqualifying exams, and a discussion of a proposeddissertation topic. Once approved by thecommittee, the statement serves as a contract forthe completion of degree requirements. Qualifying Examinations After completing the course work for aconcentration, the student is eligible to take thequalifying examination for that concentration. Allstudents except those in the Political Science concentration negotiate their own examinationschedules. The Department of Political Sciencegives field examinations twice a year at timesscheduled by the department. The examinationson policy and SPEA concentrations are written bythe members of the Progress Review Committeerepresenting those areas. After receiving a pass or qualified pass on each of the three exams, the student schedules the oralexamination. Upon completion of the oralexamination, signatures of the committeemember and program director are required onthe \"Report of Preliminary ExaminationCommittee\" form. Dissertation After filing for candidacy status, the doctoralcandidate forms a Research Committeeconsisting of at least four faculty members. Twoof the members must be School of Public andEnvironmental Affairs faculty, and two must befrom Political Science. This committee may bebut is not necessarily identical to the ProgressReview Committee. The selection of theResearch Committee members should reflect thedissertation topic and expertise of the facultychosen. The candidate prepares a dissertation proposal to present and defend in a meeting of theResearch Committee. The Research Committeereviews the research proposal and requireschanges as needed. Once the dissertation research is completed, the candidate defends the thesis in an open oralexamination meeting. The Research Committeeis ultimately responsible for determiningwhether the dissertation is acceptable. Placement The Ph.D. Office, the director of the program,and individual faculty members work hard toensure that graduates of the program are placedin academic or research organizations. Graduatesof the Joint Program in Public Policy have beenvery successful in obtaining such positions.Recent placements include George WashingtonUniversity, Emory University, Florida StateUniversity, University of North Carolina, TheOhio State University, University of Arizona,Georgia Institute of Technology, Ulsan University(Korea), the University of Massachusetts, the U.S.Agency for International Development, andUniversity of Washington. Doctoral Minors in the School of Publicand EnvironmentalAffairs The School of Public and Environmental Affairs provides course work and other student-relatedactivities for those working toward doctoraldegrees in other schools and colleges of IndianaUniversity who select a minor field in public andenvironmental affairs. Five minor fields areavailable: environmental studies, nonprofitmanagement, public management, regional economic development, and urban affairs. Environmental Studies Minor (12 credit hours) Students in Ph.D. programs at Indiana Universitymay, with the consent of their advisorycommittee, choose environmental studies as anoutside minor. The minor is flexible and isusually designed by students in accordance withtheir needs. Requirements 1. The doctoral candidate must secure a faculty advisor in consultation with the director ofthe Doctoral Program in EnvironmentalScience. The advisor may not be from thecandidate's major department. Thecandidate's advisor serves as therepresentative in all examinations or otherrequirements of the candidate's Ph.D.program that relate to the minor. Theadvisor decides on the character of theexamination, if any, in the minor field andcertifies that the candidate has met therequirements of the minor. 2. The candidate must take at least 12 credit hours of graduate-level courses related toenvironmental studies.
