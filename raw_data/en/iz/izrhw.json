Reports conflict on the significance of correlations between PD-L1 on tumor cells and positive clinical outcomes to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. We investigated this issue using genomically related, clonal subsets from the same methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma: a highly immunogenic subset that is spontaneously eliminated in vivo by adaptive immunity and a less immunogenic subset that forms tumors in immunocompetent mice, but is sensitive to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy. Using CRISPR/Cas9-induced loss-of-function approaches and overexpression gain-of-function techniques, we confirmed that PD-L1 on tumor cells is key to promoting tumor escape. In addition, the capacity of PD-L1 to suppress antitumor responses was inversely proportional to tumor cell antigenicity. PD-L1 expression on host cells, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), was also important for tumor immune escape. We demonstrated that induction of PD-L1 on tumor cells was IFN-dependent and transient, but PD-L1 induction on TAMs was of greater magnitude, only partially IFN dependent, and was stable over time. Thus, PD-L1 expression on either tumor cells or host immune cells could lead to tumor escape from immune control, indicating that total PD-L1 expression in the immediate tumor microenvironment may represent a more accurate biomarker for predicting response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy, compared with monitoring PD-L1 expression on tumor cells alone. Cancer or its major ligand PD-L1 can provoke durable antitumor responses in some cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice ( [1-5](javascript:;)). Whereas expression of PD-1 is largely restricted to lymphocytes, PD-L1 has been observed on a wide variety of cells present in the tumor microenvironment, including tumor cells, lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and cells of epithelial and endothelial origin ( [6-8](javascript:;)). Although high constitutive PD-L1 expression has been noted in a few tumors, it is more commonly induced in tumor and normal cells by cytokines, especially IFN ( [9](javascript:;)). The complexity of PD-L1 expression has made it difficult to identify the specific PD-L1-expressing cells that contribute to a tumor's escape from immune control. This issue has important mechanistic and clinical implications because PD-L1 expression may stratify patients for response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy ( [3, 5, 10, 11](javascript:;)). Past attempts to resolve this dilemma have been inconclusive ( [12-23](javascript:;)). In addition, PD-L1 on immune cells is expressed more frequently than that on tumor cells in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, urothelial carcinoma, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( [24-26](javascript:;)), suggesting distinct extrinsic regulatory pathway(s) are involved with tumor versus immune cell PD-L1 induction. using our well-characterized, methylcholanthrene [27-29](javascript:;)), we investigated whether (i) PD-L1 expression on tumor cells known to be sensitive to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockade in vivo was required for tumor immune escape; (ii) the capacity of PD-L1 to inhibit immune elimination of a tumor was linked to the antigenicity of that tumor; (iii) PD-L1 expression on host cells participated in the process; and (iv) the extrinsic PD-L1 induction on tumor versus host immune cells was regulated in a distinct manner. Materials and Methods Mice Male wild-type (WT) and Rag2/ mice on a 129S6 background were purchased from Taconic Farms. Female WT mice on a C57BL/6J background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice used in the study were between 8 and 12 weeks of age and maintained in accordance with procedures approved by the Association of Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited Animal Studies Committee of Washington University in St. Louis. Tumors MCA-induced sarcoma cells used in this study were previously generated in male 129S6 WT and Rag2/ mice ( d42m1-T9 cells confirmed their genomic stability over time. As variant calling algorithms have become significantly more accurate since our initial reporting of these cell lines ( [30](javascript:;)), we reassessed the mutational landscapes of T3 and T9 cells using the original sequence data and data from tumor cell line resequencing and found that the number of expressed missense mutations in T3 and T9 were 827 and 815, respectively. This modification did not lead to an alteration of either the predicted or found dominant antigenic epitopes. Whereas the genomic landscapes of T3 and T9 were clearly similar to one another, they were completely distinct from that of F244, an independent MCA sarcoma derived from a different 129S6 WT mouse, expressing 943 other missense somatic mutations with the single exception that T3/T9 and F244 cells expressed an identical activating Kras G12C mutation. Tumor cells were maintained in vitro in RPMI media (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone) for less than 3 weeks prior to use in experiments. Note that 1.0 \u00d7 106 tumor cells were injected subcutaneously unless otherwise indicated. Tumor growth was monitored at least 2 times a week using a digital caliper. The mean of long and short diameters was used for tumor growth curves. Mice were euthanized when tumors were > 2 cm or severely ulcerated. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. However, adequate sample size was chosen based on extensive previous work with this animal model. No randomization or blinding was performed. Ex vivo analyses were performed as previously described ( [29](javascript:;)). Murine PD-L2 (GL261-PD-L2) was kindly gifted from G.P. Dunn (Washington University School of Medicine). For detection of PD-L1 and MHC class I expression in vitro, tumor cells were treated with 300 U/mL murine IFN for 48 to 72 hours unless otherwise indicated. For detection of PD-L2 in vitro, tumor cells were treated with 300 U/mL murine IFN, 10 g/mL murine TNF, or in combination for 48 hours. Cell lines were authenticated by NGS in our lab and routinely tested for mycoplasma infection. Antibodies Antibodies used for comprehensive flow cytometry analysis of cell subsets in tumors are listed in Supplementary Table S1 ( [31](javascript:;)). In addition, the following mAbs cells were stained with Po-Pro-1 or Live/Dead Aqua (Invitrogen). Numbers of cell surface PD-L1 molecules were calculated using Quantibrite PE beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Technologies) were used as controls. Antibodies (200 g per dose) were injected i.p. unless otherwise specified. For the mAb clones 4H2 and 14D8, injections were on days 3, 6, and 9. For mAb clones RMP1-14 and 10F.9G2, injections were on days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18. In vivo CD4+/CD8+ cell depletion was performed as previously described using rat IgG2b anti-mouse cDNA was isolated from total RNA extracted from F244 tumor cells treated with 300 U/mL IFN for 48 hours and PD-L1 cDNA amplified by PCR using a forward primer (5-AGATCTATGAGGATATTTGCTGGCATT-3) and a reverse primer (5-CTCGAGTTACGTCTCCTCGAATTGTGTATC-3). The PD-L1 cDNA was subsequently cloned into the pCR-TOPO-Blunt II vector (Invitrogen). The PD-L1 cDNA cloned from the MCA sarcoma cells showed an identical sequence to that from a spleen in a na\u00efve 129S6 male mouse (data not shown). Generation of expression-transduced tumor cells using the retroviral system The retroviral vector with GFP (RV-GFP) was a gift of K. Murphy, Washington University. For generation of the retroviral vector without GFP (RV), RV-GFP was digested with SalI and self-ligated. Following digestion of the PD-L1-pCR-TOPO Blunt II vector with BglII and XhoI, PD-L1 cDNA was subcloned into the hours of retroviral production ( [28](javascript:;)), the supernatant was subsequently used for transfection with tumor cells. Tumor clones such as T9-PD-L1ovr and T9-PD-L1phy cells were obtained by limiting dilution. Mutation-specific RT-PCR and qRT-PCR The procedures for detection of mutant Spectrin-2 by RT-PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion were previously described in detail ( [28](javascript:;)). For detection of mutant Lama4 by qRT-PCR, a forward primer (5-GGATGCCCAGAGGACTCTCTG-3) and a reverse primer (5-GTAATGTTCGGAAATTGAAGCCTA-3) were used. For detection of mutant Alg8 by qRT-PCR, a forward primer (5-TCCCGTTTACCTCCTGGAAGC-3) and a reverse primer (5-AGCATACAGCCTGGTCCAGGT-3) were used. In vitro cytotoxicity assay The mutant Spectrin-2-specific T-cell line (C3) was established as previously described ( [28](javascript:;)). Following treatment with 300 U/mL IFN for 48 hours, tumor cells were labeled with eFluor 670 (eBioscience) at 0.5 mol/L as a target. 10,000 tumor cells and different numbers of T cells at the indicated ratios were incubated in a well of a 96-well plate for 12 hours. Another 10,000 tumor cells labeled with eFluor 670 at 5 mol/L were used to calculate numbers of tumor cells killed as a reference. Dead cells were stained with Po-Pro-1. Killing efficiency was calculated by the following formula: 100% \u00d7 {1 - [(% tumor cells with 5 mol/L)control \u00d7 (% tumor cells with 0.5 mol/L)target]/[(% tumor cells with 0.5 mol/L)control \u00d7 (% tumor cells with 5 mol/L)target]}. ELISA Following treatment with 300 U/mL IFN for 48 hours, tumor cells were irradiated at 10,000 rads. T cells and tumor cells were cocultured in a well of a 96-well plate for 48 hours. IFN concentration in the supernatant was measured by mouse IFN gamma ELISA Ready-SET-Go! (eBioscience). Generation of PD-L1 knockout tumor lines using CRISPR-Cas9 To generate T3 lines lacking PD-L1 expression (T3PDL1.1-7) and a F244 line PD-L1 we designed the single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) at in 2014. The according to the manufacturer's instruction. GFP-positive cells were subsequently sorted 72 hours after transfection. Following generation of clones by limiting dilution, we performed targeting deep sequencing of the PD-L1 genomic locus and confirmed the presence of premature stop codons in all alleles. For detection of Cas9 cDNA, a forward primer (5-CCGAAGAGGTCGTGAAGAAG-3) and a reverse primer (5-TCGCTTTCCAGCTTAGGGTA-3) were used. PD-L1 WT parental tumor cells treated with pX330 and pmaxGFP, and the PD-L1 knockout cells were subsequently transduced with either the RV or the RV-PD-L1 to generate T3WT-Mock, T3PDL1-Mock, and T3PDL1-PDL1. For the other F244 tumor lines lacking PD-L1 expression (F244PDL1.2 and F244PDL1.3), the extracellular domain of 5-GAAAGAACGCATGATACATA-3 (g7) and 5-TTCTACTACAGCAGCCCGGG-3 (g43) were used for the first step. Subsequently, those targeting 5-CACACTTGCAAATCGGTTGT-3(g29) and 5-AGTCATTGAGTATTCGTGGC-3 (g2) were used for the second. Gene deletion was confirmed by diagnostic PCR. For generation of MC38 lines lacking PD-L1 expression (MC38PDL1.1 and MC38PDL1.2), MC38 cells were transiently transfected a vector encoding Cas9-2A-GFP and the guide oligo (5-GCCAGGGCAAAACCACACAG-3) derived from exon IV of the mouse PD-L1 gene. Cells were sorted for GFP, sequenced by NGS, and single-cell cloned. MC38PDL1.1 had one allele with a 2-bp deletion in exon IV and the other allele with a single bp deletion, both of which introduced in-frame stop codons. Both alleles of the PD-L1 gene in MC38PDL1.2 had the same single bp insertion that also caused premature translation termination. cDNA-CapSeq and mutation calling Following data generation and alignment of Illumina paired-end reads to the mouse reference genome sequence, somatic variant analysis was done comparing tumor cDNA-CapSeq data with matched normal exome data. We used a combination of three variant then translated into a 17-mer amino acid FASTA sequence and analyzed through pVAC-Seq ( [30](javascript:;)) to identify and shortlist potential high-affinity neoantigens. Briefly, to only target variants in the expressed genes, we restricted our subsequent analysis to genes with expression level (in fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped) values of > 1, and wherein we could identify evidence that the mutant allele was expressed. Also, we filtered out any variants with normal coverage 5\u00d7 and normal VAF of 2%. In addition, only variants with tumor coverage of 10\u00d7 with a VAF of 25% were considered. Statistical analysis Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for statistical analysis. No samples or animals were excluded from the analysis. Comparison between samples was performed using an unpaired, two-tailed Student t test or one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison test. Welch corrections were used when variances between groups were unequal. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results We previously reported that the d42m1 sarcoma line, derived from an MCA-treated immunodeficient 129S6 strain Rag2/ mouse, comprises two genomically d42m1 cells (exemplified by d42m1-T9 (T9) cells), represents the highly immunogenic, unedited ( [38](javascript:;)) variant because it expresses an R913L somatic point mutation in Spectrin-2 (mS2) that functions as a strong rejection neoantigen responsible, at least in part, for the spontaneous elimination of T9 cells when transplanted into na\u00efve syngeneic WT recipients. The minor subset, comprising approximately 20% of d42m1 cells (exemplified by d42m1-T3 (T3) cells), represents edited variants of d42m1 that T-cell-dependent immunoselection of parental d42m1 sarcoma cells. T3 cells do not express mutant mS2, are capable of forming progressively growing tumors in WT mice, but can be immunologically eliminated when tumor-bearing mice are treated with mAbs that blockade-induced immune rejection of T3 tumors is the result of reinvigoration of T cells with specificities against two dominant neoantigens specifically expressed in T3 cells derived from somatic point mutations in We study by asking whether PD-L1 expression on T3 sarcoma cells plays an important role in preventing their immune elimination in vivo. Using a PD-L1-guided CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing approach, we generated seven T3-based sarcoma PD-L1 (T3PDL1.1-T3PDL1.7). Deep sequencing of the PD-L1 genomic locus of each line showed the presence of premature stop codons in all alleles (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Expression of the Cas9 protein should be transient, but since the Cas9 protein is predicted to express strong MHC class I epitopes that could influence tumor cell growth in vivo ( [39](javascript:;)), we tested each T3PDL1 line for the presence of residual Cas9 expression by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and verified no Cas9 mRNA was present (Supplementary Fig. S1B). All of the T3PDL1 lines retained expression of mLama4 and mAlg8 as detected by quantitative (q)RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. and S1D). Functionally, whereas WT T3 cells (T3WT) constitutively expressed low amounts of PD-L1 that were significantly upregulated when the cells were exposed to IFN, PD-L1 expression on T3PDL1 cells was undetectable either [Fig. 2A](javascript:;)). Each T3PDL1 line upregulated MHC class I expression in response to IFN to an extent that was indistinguishable from T3WT cells ( [Fig. 2A](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) We next monitored the in vivo growth behavior of T3PDL1 cells. By day 50 after transplantation, 80% (74/92) of na\u00efve syngeneic WT mice had spontaneously rejected the different T3PDL1 cells, whereas growing tumors were observed in all of the Rag2/ mice ( [Fig. 2B](javascript:;)). T3PDL1 tumors escaping rejection neither expressed PD-L1 in response to IFN stimulation in vitro nor lost expression of immunogenic neoantigens (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). These data suggest that additional sources of PD-L1 may participate in the process of tumor immune escape. WT mice that rejected T3PDL1 cells resisted rechallenge with T3WT, but not challenge with unrelated F244 MCA sarcoma cells, demonstrating the induction of in T3PDL1 experienced mice ( [Fig. 2C](javascript:;)). When the capacities of parental T3 and two representative T3PDL1 lines to stimulate IFN production from CTL74.17 mLama4-specificcytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones were compared, T3PDL1 cells stimulated significantly more IFN than T3WT cells, revealing that PD-L1 expression on CTL To validate the causality cell-expressed PD-L1 in immune escape of T3 sarcoma cells, we transduction (T3PDL1-PDL1; [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)) and showed that T3PDL1-PDL1 cells regained the capacity to form progressively growing tumors in WT mice ( [Fig. 3B](javascript:;)). In contrast, T3PDL1.1 cells transduced with empty virus (T3PDL1-Mock) were rejected. When mice bearing T3PDL1-PDL1 tumors were treated with anti-PD-1, the tumors were rejected ( [Fig. 3B](javascript:;)). Because ( [40-42](javascript:;)), we also tested T3 cells PD-L2 expression. We did not detect PD-L2, either constitutively or following exposure to IFN or TNF, either alone or in combination (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). Similar results were obtained when PD-L1 expression was extinguished in a second, independent MCA sarcoma line (F244) and in the MC38 colorectal carcinoma cell line ( [Fig. 4A-D](javascript:;)). Thus, the importance of PD-L1 on tumor cells in promoting tumor immune escape is generalizable not only to different edited MCA sarcoma lines but also to at least one other tumor type as well. [Close modal](javascript:;) [Close modal](javascript:;) Having validated a causal role in escape for tumor cell-expressed PD-L1 on edited sarcoma cells, we then investigated whether PD-L1 played a similar role on highly immunogenic, unedited variants from the same tumor ( [Fig. 1](javascript:;); Supplementary Fig. S4A). We enforced PD-L1 expression in T9 tumor cells and monitored in vivo growth of the bulk-transduced T9 cell line in na\u00efve WT recipients. Most PD-L1-transduced T9 cells (T9-PDL1 cells) in the bulk population expressed much more PD-L1 than either untreated or IFN-treated parental T9 cells (T9WT; Supplementary Fig. S4B). T9-PDL1 cells, but not mock-transduced T9 cells, formed progressively growing tumors in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. S4C). All progressively growing T9-PDL1 tumors retained expression of mS2 (Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4E), thereby ruling out the possibility that tumor cell outgrowth was due to loss of the major rejection antigen. To examine the quantitative requirements of PD-L1 expression on the immunogenicity of unedited sarcomas, we isolated T9-PDL1 clones that ectopically expressed PD-L1 at levels either similar to (T9-PDL1phy) or 20-fold above (T9-PDL1ovr) those induced and B](javascript:;)). When injected into WT mice, T9-PDL1phy cells were spontaneously rejected. In contrast, T9-PDL1ovr cells formed progressively growing tumors ( [Fig. 5C](javascript:;)). However, T9-PDL1ovr cells were eliminated when tumor-bearing with mAbs to PD-1 or PD-L1 ( [Fig. 5D](javascript:;)). Similar results either a blocking, but nondepleting, anti-PD-L1 (mAb 14D8) [32](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) To further assess the functional consequences of differences in PD-L1 expression on T9-PDL1 cells, we compared their relative sensitivities to in vitro killing by the C3 mS2-specific CTL clone. T9-PDL1ovr cells were poorly killed compared with T9-PDL1phy cells or parental T9 sarcoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). However, when anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 was added into the in vitro culture, killing efficiency against T9-PDL1ovr cells was restored to levels similar to those against T9-PDL1phy or parental T9 sarcoma cells ( [Fig. was used [Fig. 5F](javascript:;)). To confirm the generality of these findings, we enforced PD-L1 expression in a second, unedited highly immunogenic (H31m1; refs. [28, T9-PDL1 cells, levels of ectopically expressed PD-L1 on H31m1-PDL1 were considerably higher than those on the parental H31m1 cells treated with IFN ( [Fig. 6B](javascript:;)). Progressively growing H31m1-PDL1 tumors were observed in 17 of 20 challenged WT mice compared with 0 of 20 WT mice injected with control H31m1 tumor cells ( [Fig. 6C](javascript:;)). Together, these results show that highly immunogenic unedited sarcoma cells require abnormally high expression of PD-L1 to escape immune control and form progressively growing tumors in immunocompetent mice. Thus, levels of PD-L1 expression that can be induced on tumor cells under physiologic conditions are not sufficient to prevent immune elimination of highly immunogenic unedited MCA sarcoma cells that express strong neoantigens. [Close modal](javascript:;) Although our experiments supported a critical role for PD-L1 on tumor cells in mediating tumor escape, they did not rule out the possibility that PD-L1 on host cells also contributed to the process. Unexpectedly, when WT mice were challenged with increasing numbers of T3PDL1 tumor cells, the number of mice with progressively growing tumors increased ( [Fig. 7A and B](javascript:;)). Because the only source of PD-L1 in these experiments was from host cells, we treated mice with progressively growing T3PDL1 tumors with anti-PD-L1 or control mAb and found that therapeutic administration of the former but not the latter induced tumor rejection ( [Fig. 7A and B](javascript:;)). Thus, PD-L1 expression on host cells also participates in preventing immune elimination of edited MCA sarcoma cells. [Close modal](javascript:;) To obtain mechanistic insight into the roles of host versus tumor PD-L1 in preventing immune elimination of sarcomas, we measured the kinetics and magnitude of PD-L1 induction and retention on tumor cells and various populations of host cells in the tumor microenvironment. PD-L1 was upregulated on T3 tumor cells in vivo in a transient and time-dependent manner with peak expression occurring at approximately 9 days after injection, but returning to baseline by approximately 12 days ( [Figs. 1](javascript:;) and [7C](javascript:;); Supplementary Fig. S6A). Upregulation of PD-L1 on tumor cells was tightly linked to IFN exposure in vivo, because it was completely inhibited when mice were treated with IFN-neutralizing mAb ( [Fig. 7C](javascript:;)). The IFN dependency of PD-L1 induction on tumor cells was also observed in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Similarly, PD-L1 expression on host immune cells in the tumor microenvironment reached maximal values at 9 days and declined thereafter although at a slower rate than seen on tumor cells ( [Fig. 1](javascript:;); Supplementary Fig. S6A). This slow decay of PD-L1 expression on host immune cells was particularly noteworthy. We therefore defined three distinctive features about host cell-expressed PD-L1 expression. First, a detailed analysis of the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment revealed that tumor-associated macrophages were not only the major host cell population in the tumor microenvironment, but they also expressed the vast majority of PD-L1 in the tumor (72% of total PD-L1 on tumor and host cells was expressed on TAMs at day 9; [Fig. 7D](javascript:;); Supplementary Figs. and S8A-S8D). Second, PD-L1 expression on TAMs was retained for long period of time, well after PD-L1 on tumor cells was completely extinguished ( [Fig. 7C](javascript:;)). Third, PD-L1 expression on TAMs was increased in tumor-bearing mice treated either saturating doses of neutralizing anti-IFN ( [Fig. 7C](javascript:;)) 8-fold higher ( [Fig. 7E](javascript:;)), although the magnitude of increased PD-L1 expression was less than when IFN was present. This observation was not due to changes in the tumor microenvironment by the early mAb injection protocol, because PD-L1 expression on TAMs at day 12 remained high even when IFN mAb was injected at day 9 ( [Fig. 7E](javascript:;)). Similar results were obtained when the experiments were repeated with the unrelated F244 sarcoma cell line ( [Figs. 4A](javascript:;) and [7F](javascript:;)). CD4+ or CD8+ cells were depleted from WT mice, we found that the IFN-independent induction/retention of PD-L1 on TAMs required the presence not T cells ( [Fig. 7F](javascript:;)). Thus, on induced by two alternative cell-extrinsic pathways involving CD4+ T cells, one that is IFN-dependent and one that is IFN-independent. Taken together, these results show that TAMs are the major host cell type that contributes PD-L1 in our sarcoma tumor model both quantitatively and temporally. Discussion This study provides novel functional and fundamental insights into the roles of PD-L1 in facilitating tumor escape from immune control. On edited tumor cells, whose antigenicity has been tempered by the tumor-sculpting power of immunity, IFN-dependent induction of PD-L1 expression initiates the establishment of the immunosuppressive force that facilitates tumor outgrowth. However, PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is transient, and expression is rapidly extinguished. This downregulation of PD-L1 most likely occurs, at least in part, as a consequence of PD-L1s ability to inhibit IFN production by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. TAMs are the major cellular sources that maintain expression of PD-L1, long after PD-L1 on tumor cells is extinguished. The temporal dichotomy between PD-L1 expression on tumor cells versus TAMs results in the establishment of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in which the majority of PD-L1 is contributed by TAMs as opposed to tumor cells. The prolonged PD-L1 expression on TAMs is cell extrinsic, IFN-independent, but requires CD4+ T cells. The eventual discovery of the molecule(s) responsible for the chronic PD-L1 expression by TAMs may well provide new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. Our findings also are consistent with two mechanisms by which TAMs could exert their immunosuppressive activity in progressively growing tumors. It is likely that PD-L1-expressing TAMs in tumors are recognized by tumor-specific T cells and deliver their PD-L1-dependent inhibitory signal to these T cells just as if they were tumor cells themselves. This scenario suggests that PD-L1-expressing TAMs function in cis to prolong the immunosuppressive state in the microenvironment of a progressively growing tumor. This mechanism is consistent with that observed in vitro with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that also bear high amounts of PD-L1 ( [7, 45](javascript:;)). The second scenario is one in which TAMs, or even other host cell types, repress T-cell function by supplying the high levels of PD-L1 in trans. The latter mechanism is consistent with data from in vitro studies in which T-cell activation was assessed following coculture of PD-L1-expressing monocytes with T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 ( [46, 47](javascript:;)). It is certainly possible that different types of tumors could display distinct distributions of PD-L1 between cancer cells and host cells, or that differences in the nature, quantity, or kinetics of tumor-infiltrating hematopoietic cells determine the ultimate distribution of tumor- versus host cell-expressed PD-L1. Future studies will need to explore these two scenarios in more depth to determine the conditions where one or the other predominates. Therefore, the results of this study argue strongly that PD-L1 expression on either tumor cells or host cells should be used as the biomarker for determining whether a patient is a good candidate for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy, presumably when tumors retain high mutation burden ( [18, 48](javascript:;)). Finally, this study also provides the fundamental insight that PD-L1 expression on edited tumor cells (such as T3), whose antigenicities have undergone immunologic sculpting, versus highly antigenic unedited tumor cells, such as those that have not undergone cancer immunoediting (ref. [38](javascript:;); e.g., T9), results in very different outcomes. This report thus demonstrates the inverse relationship between tumor antigenicity and the capacity of PD-L1 to promote tumor escape. This observation leads to the logical conclusion that adaptive immune resistance ( [49](javascript:;)), the process wherein immune attack on a tumor results in the upregulation of immunosuppressive moieties that inhibit immune control of the tumor, is relevant predominantly to tumors of either inherently low antigenicity or to tumors that have gone through the cancer immunoediting process, resulting in generation of antigen-loss tumor variants with reduced antigenicities ( [38, 50](javascript:;)). The important implication, then, is that cancer immunoediting and adaptive immune resistance are not separate processes but rather part of the same continuum of immune system-tumor interactions.
