The body can then operate at its optimal level of chi from where it is able to access its inherent ability to heal itself. Chi is the life force that runs through the body, and is the ultimate measure of one's vitality. When a person has stored trauma in their cells (from personal or ancestral karma, past life or current life traumas), their vibration is lowered. This lower vibrating energy affects mood and energy levels and can be a cause of illness. When a persons 'life force energy' is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stressed, and if it is high we are more capable of being emotionally, mentally and physically healthy, uplifted and balanced. When blocks are cleared from the body it frees up life force/chi to flow strongly. The human body has 7 main spiritual energy centres called Chakras (Root, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, Throat, 3rd Eye & Crown). If a person has experienced abuse, denied affection and love as a child or betrayal, the heart chakra can be affected if a trauma or negative emotion is repressed instead of being processed at the time it arises. Over time this can cause physical symptoms - circulation of the heart to be compromised, heart palpitations and even heart attack. Emotionally it can cause the person to feel disconnected to others, hold grudges, emotionally distant in relationships, self critical, have low self worth or have trust issues. Until the heart is cleared from stored traumas the person will not be able to fully give & receive love. The practitioner places her hands lightly on or over specific areas of your body to facilitate the process of healing. You may experience feelings of being very relaxed or you may feel heat on the area that is being touched, rumbling noises in the tummy, tingling or a sensation of energy traveling through your body. When a major block is being shifted from a chakra/organ/area you may feel an urge to cry or may have memories arise as the energy is shifting. Straight afterwards you may feel deeply relaxed, emotionally lighter, happier, have more energy or feel like you just ran a marathon and need to sleep. In the days following a healing, your mood, feelings, emotions and realisations can be changeable so do observe yourself and take note of any changes you are experiencing. Every single healing session is different. The benefits of Energy Healing include, but are not limited to: As often as you feel the need to. That could be monthly or sooner if it's for a physical condition, managing stress or palliative care. Energy healing can benefit anyone, from babies to the elderly, those in palliative care or anyone that wants to have a deeper understanding of, and to improve their emotional, spiritual and physical well-being. Animals are receptive to energy healing so its wonderful to use on pets too! Healings can be done in person or by distance. As a complimentary therapy, the use of Reiki in hospitals, nursing homes and palliative care centres around the world is increasing. A study in 2015 found that people being treated for cancer who received distant reiki in addition to regular medical care had lower levels of pain, anxiety, and fatigue. REIKI is an Energy Healing technique that was created in Japan by Dr Mikao Usui in the early 20th century. It does not claim to cure disease or illness but has been shown to be effective for reducing pain, anxiety and increasing energy. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit, creating many beneficial effects that include relaxation and feelings of peace, security and wellbeing. Many have reported miraculous results. KARUNA is a powerful frequency that heals on a multidimensional level. It is a Sanskrit word and is translated to mean any action that is taken to diminish the suffering of others and could also be translated as \"compassionate action.\" It can help with past life issues, release karma and deeply seated issues on the cellular level, can breakup the negative patterns we unconsciously use to insulate ourselves from the truth. It restores balance, grounding, connects one with their higher self and can help to explain physical illnesses/ailments that are not going away. SEICHIM is a sacred, advanced form of hands on healing that accesses all levels of consciousness. Seichim is associated with the Goddesses Kuan Yin and Sekhmet. Seichim light language and alchemy codes go deep in the heart allowing past memories to shift and move as the toxic energy dissolves into life force energy, helping the body to heal itself by reaching the vibrational cause. Biljana is an attuned Reiki, Seichim and Karuna Master and intuitively uses frequencies needed best for you to facilitate mind, body and spirit balance and transformation. "}
