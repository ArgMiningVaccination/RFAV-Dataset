There is so much to do and everything is outside, no stuffy indoor park. The unique idea of a natural park is something that never existed in the Dells. This place is one of a kind and should definitely be on your list to visit in your vacation. I will definitely be going back no question about it Tiffany Wojtasik My entire family loved it - not an easy task! We will be back! Great staff, clean place, great food and the fun is amazing! Mikal Hrnic As a local of the Dells, this is the best outdoor attraction and experience! There is absolutely nothing like it around that I have ever seen. I brought the family on 4th of July and we all had an amazing experience! Dennis Neira This is really something special! This is a natural paradise nestled within the dells. It almost feels like I am in Maui. The cabanas, wibits, slides, and food were out of this world. Mark my words this will be the place to be!! Technoz Ski Hubby's words were \"best time I've had in a long time and funnest way to get a work out\". Mocktails were AMAZING! Can't wait to try it myself next year Rose Greenwood I loved the naturally filtered pond and sandy beach (included in general admission)! We were able to attend the free weekend and it was fun for my kiddos to swim to the island, make sand castles and hang out by the little waterfalls. Kids found baby frogs and little fish and enjoyed hunting for those for about an hour. Hannah Wilson My kids spent 5 hours on the inflatables. Drinks were amazing and food looked good as well. Having the nice soft sand for the kids to play on was a bonus and when they finish the water slides that will be fun too! Stacey Miller We did the Waterworld obstacle course and it was a blast! Felt like kids again and had so many laughs. Drinks were good, staff were friendly and personable. Can't wait to see the new attractions when they're open. Great place to visit for adults as well as families. (We're a couple in our 30s) LJ Weber Get early access to offers & events sent directly to "}
