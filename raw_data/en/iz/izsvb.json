Vaccines Routine infant immunization with live, oral rotavirus vaccines (LORVs) has had a major impact on severe gastroenteritis disease. Nevertheless, in high morbidity and mortality settings rotavirus remains an important cause of disease, partly attributable to the sub-optimal clinical efficacy of LORVs in those settings. Regardless of the precise immunological mechanism(s) underlying the diminished efficacy, the introduction of injectable next-generation rotavirus vaccines (iNGRV), currently in clinical development, could offer a potent remedy. In addition to the potential for greater clinical efficacy, precisely how iNGRVs are delivered (multiple doses to young infants; alongside LORVs or as a booster; co-formulated with Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP)-containing vaccines), their pricing, and their storage and cold chain characteristics could each have major implications on the resultant health outcomes, on cost-effectiveness as well as on product preferences by national stakeholders... Justification: There is a need to revise/review recommendations regarding existing vaccines in view of current developments in vaccinology. Process: Advisory Committee on Vaccines and Immunization Practices (ACVIP) of Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) reviewed the new evidence, had two meetings, and representatives of few vaccine manufacturers also presented their data. The recommendations were finalized unanimously. Objectives: To revise and review the IAP recommendations for 2018-19 and issue recommendations on existing and certain new vaccines. Recommendations. The major changes in the IAP 2018-19 Immunization Timetable include administration of hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of age, acceptance of four doses of hepatitis B vaccine if a combination pentavalent or hexavalent vaccine is used, administration of DTwP or DTaP in the primary series, and complete replacement of oral polio vaccine (OPV) by injectable polio vaccine (IPV) as early as possible. In case IPV is not avail... Vaccines Safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness are paramount to vaccine development. Following the isolation of rotavirus particles in 1969 and its evidence as an aetiology of severe dehydrating diarrhoea in infants and young children worldwide, the quest to find not only an acceptable and reliable but cost-effective vaccine has continued until now. Four live-attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines (LAORoVs) (Rotarix\u00ae, RotaTeq\u00ae, Rotavac\u00ae, and RotaSIIL\u00ae) have been developed and licensed to be used against all forms of rotavirus-associated infection. The efficacy of these vaccines is more obvious in the high-income countries (HIC) compared with the low- to middle-income countries (LMICs); however, the impact is far exceeding in the low-income countries (LICs). Despite the rotavirus vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, more than 90 countries (mostly Asia, America, and Europe) are yet to implement any of these vaccines. Implementation of these vaccines has continued to suffer a setback in these cou... BMC Health Services Research Background The phased withdrawal of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and the introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is central to the polio 'end-game' strategy. Methods We analyzed the cost implications in Chile of a switch from the vaccination scheme consisting of a pentavalent vaccine with whole-cell pertussis component (wP) plus IPV/OPV vaccines to a scheme with a hexavalent vaccine with acellular pertussis component (aP) and IPV (Hexaxim\u00ae) from a societal perspective. Cost data were collected from a variety of sources including national estimates and previous vaccine studies. All costs were expressed in 2017 prices (US$ 1.00 = $Ch 666.26). Results The overall costs associated with the vaccination scheme (4 doses of pentavalent vaccine plus 1 dose IPV and 3 doses OPV) from a societal perspective was estimated to be US$ 12.70 million, of which US$ 8.84 million were associated with the management of adverse events related to wP. In comparison, the cost associated with the 4-d... Vaccine 2013 International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on health service delivery, including immunization programs, and this review assesses the impact on vaccine coverage across the globe and identifies the potential underlying factors. A systematic search strategy was employed on PubMed, Embase, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and WHO COVID-19 databases from December 2019 till 15 September 2020. Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted the data (PROSPERO registration #CRD42020182363). A total of 17 observational studies were included. The findings suggest that there was a reduction in the vaccination coverage and decline in total number of vaccines administered, which led to children missing out on their vaccine doses. An approximately fourfold increase was also observed in polio cases in polio endemic countries. Factors contributing to low vaccine coverage included fear of being exposed to the virus at health care facilities, restriction on city-wide mo... Vaccine 2012 Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics 2021 Introduction: Immunization is an effective preventive health intervention. In Cameroon, the Expanded Program on Immunization aims to vaccinate children under five years old for free, but vaccination coverage has consistently remained below the national target. Vaccines are distributed based on the target population size, factoring in wastage norms. However, vaccine wastage rates (VWR) may differ among various settings. Our study aimed to assess vaccine wastage for different site settings, seasonality, and vaccine types in comparison to vaccination coverage. As the government of Cameroon continuously seek to improve and vaccination coverage and vaccine wastage, an investigation into why vaccines are being wasted may provide solutions to minimize it occurrences.Methods: Retrospective data on immunization and vaccine wastage covering 2016 and 2017 in the Littoral Region, Cameroon, were collected. Health districts were classified as urban or rural, seasonality categorized as rainy or dr... Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
