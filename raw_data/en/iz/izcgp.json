KIM REYNOLDS ex rel. STATE OF IOWA, IOWA BOARD OF MEDICINE, Respondents. Equity Case No. _________ PETITION FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF COME NOW Petitioners Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. (\"PPH\"), Sarah Traxler, M.D., and Emma Goldman Clinic (\"EGC\") (collectively, \"Petitioners\"), by and through their attorneys, Rita Bettis Austen and Sharon Wegner of the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa Foundation; Peter Im, Anjali Salvador, and Dylan Cowit of Planned Parenthood Federation of America; and Caitlin Slessor and Samuel E. Jones of Shuttleworth & Ingersoll, PLLC, pray for emergency temporary injunctive relief, as well as permanent injunctive relief, restraining Respondents Governor Kim Reynolds ex rel. State of Iowa and the Iowa Board of Medicine (collectively, \"the State\") from enforcing House File 732 (\"HF 732\" or \"the Act\"), as well as a declaratory judgment that the Act violates the Iowa Constitution, and in support thereof state the following: E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE 1. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the constitutionality of HF 732, to be codified at Iowa Code chapter 146E, which will go into immediate effect when Governor Reynolds signs into law on July 14, 2023. The Act bans abortions upon the detection of embryonic or fetal cardiac activity, which can occur as early as six weeks of gestational age, as measured from the first day of a pregnant person's last menstrual period (\"LMP\")\u2014before many people even know that they are pregnant. See HF 732 \u00a7 2(2)(a) (\"Exhibit A\"); (\"Traxler Aff.\") \u00b6 13 . If it is not enjoined, the Act will decimate access to abortion in Iowa. 2. In 2019, this Court permanently enjoined a virtually identical 2018 law that also banned abortions upon the detection of embryonic or fetal cardiac activity (\"the 2018 Six-Week Ban\"). See Ruling on Mot. for Summ. J., Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds , No. EQCE83074 (Polk Cnty. Dist. Ct. Jan. 22, 2019). Last December, this Court denied the State's motion to dissolve that injunction, holding that \"[t]he ban on nearly all abortions\" would violate the Iowa Constitution under the undue burden standard. Ruling on Mot. to Dissolve Perm. Injunction Issued Jan. 22, 2019 at 15, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland , No. EQCE83074 (Dec. 12, 2022). Less than one month ago, the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed this Court's ruling by operation of law. See Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds , No. 22-2036 (Iowa June 16, 2023). 3. On July 5, 2023, less than three weeks after the Supreme Court issued its order, Governor Reynolds called the Iowa General Assembly into a one-day special session on July 11 \"for the sole and single purpose\" of enacting an abortion ban to replace the one permanently enjoined by this Court. See Proclamation of Special Session (July 5, 2023) (\"Exhibit B\"). 4. During this one-day special session, the General Assembly introduced, debated, and passed the Act. Debate in each chamber lasted less than seven hours, and the entire session E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 3 lasted less than a day\u2014less than the twenty-four hours that Iowa law requires patients to wait before having an abortion. See Iowa Code \u00a7 146A.1. The General Assembly passed the Act before midnight on July 11. 5. Shortly afterward, Governor Reynolds issued a statement in response to the passage of the Act, stating that she will sign it into law on Friday, July 14, 2023. See Press Release, Office of Governor Kim Reynolds, Gov. Reynolds Statement on Special Session to Protect Life (July 11, 2023), https://governor.iowa.gov/press-release/2023-07-11/gov-reynolds-statement-special- session-protect-life (\"Exhibit C\"). 6. The Act will take effect immediately upon Governor Reynolds's signature. See HF 732 \u00a7 3. 7. Because the Act takes effect so early in pregnancy, it will ban the vast majority of abortions in Iowa. The Act bans abortions at a stage at which many people do not yet know they are pregnant, and even those who do know may not have had time to make a decision about whether to have an abortion, research their options, and schedule appointments at a health center, not to mention overcoming the logistical and financial obstacles required to travel to a health center for an abortion. 8. By banning the vast majority of abortions in Iowa, the Act unlawfully violates the rights of Petitioners, their medical providers and other staff, and their patients under the Iowa Constitution and would severely jeopardize their health, safety, and welfare. 9. To safeguard themselves, their medical providers and other staff, and their patients from this unconstitutional law, Petitioners seek a temporary injunction to take effect upon the Act's enactment by the Governor, followed by declaratory and permanent injunctive relief, to prevent the State from enforcing the Act. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 4 PARTIES 10. Petitioner PPH is a nonprofit corporation headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa. At its eight Iowa health centers, PPH provides a wide range of health care, including annual gynecological exams, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, a range of birth control options including long-acting reversible contraception, gender affirming care, and medication and procedural abortions. 11. PPH provides procedural abortions at two Iowa health centers, in Des Moines and Iowa City, and medication abortions at five Iowa health centers, in Ames, Council Bluffs, Des Moines, Iowa City, and Sioux City. PPH provided over 3500 abortions in Iowa in 2021 and over 3300 abortions in Iowa in 2022. In the first half of 2023, PPH provided just under 1200 abortions in Iowa. PPH provides pre-viability abortions up to 20 weeks and 6 days LMP. 12. PPH sues on its own behalf, on behalf of its medical providers and other staff, and on behalf of its patients who will be adversely affected by the State's actions. 13. Petitioner Dr. Sarah Traxler is the Medical Director for PPH. Dr. Traxler is a board- certified obstetrician and gynecologist licensed to practice medicine in Iowa, in addition to Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Maine. Dr. Traxler provides reproductive health care to PPH patients in Iowa, including medication and procedural abortions. Dr. Traxler sues on her own behalf and on behalf of her patients who will be adversely affected by the State's actions. 14. Petitioner EGC is a not-for-profit independent organization with one clinic location in Iowa City. EGC provides reproductive health care through all stages of life. Its services include annual gynecological exams; cancer screenings; sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment; a range of birth control options, including long-acting reversible contraception such as intrauterine devices; physical exams for men, transgender, and gender non-conforming people; and abortion services. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 5 15. EGC provides medication and procedural abortions at its clinic in Iowa City. From October 2020 through September 2021, EGC provided 686 abortions; from October 2021 EGC provided 703 abortions. EGC provides pre-viability abortions up to 19 weeks and 6 days LMP. 16. EGC sues on its own behalf, on behalf of its medical providers and other staff, and on behalf of its patients who will be adversely affected by the State's actions. 17. Respondent Kim Reynolds is the Governor of Iowa, and as such is the chief executive for the State, responsible for ensuring the enforcement of the State's statutes. See Iowa Const. art. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9. The Governor is sued in her official capacity. 18. Respondent Iowa Board of Medicine is a state agency as defined in the Iowa Administrative Procedures Act, Iowa Code \u00a7 l7A.2(1). It is charged with administering the Act, see HF 732 \u00a7 2(5), as well as with disciplining individuals licensed to practice medicine and surgery or osteopathic medicine and surgery pursuant to Iowa Code \u00a7 148.1-14, including licensees who violate a state statute that \"relates to the practice of medicine.\" Iowa Code \u00a7 148.6(2)(b). JURISDICTION AND VENUE 19. This action seeks a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief pursuant to Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure 1.1101-1.1109, 1.1501-1.1511, and the common law. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Iowa Code \u00a7 602.6101. 20. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Iowa Code \u00a7 616.3(2) because part of the cause arose in Polk County and Respondent Iowa Board of Medicine's primary office is located in Polk County, as is the office of Respondent Governor Reynolds. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 6 OPERATIVE FACTS Prior Iowa Abortion Law 21. On May 4, 2018, Governor Reynolds signed Senate File 359 into law, which would have banned abortion as soon as embryonic or fetal cardiac activity could be detected by ultrasound, which can occur as early as six weeks LMP. See 2018 Senate File 359. The 2018 Six- Week Ban was set to take effect on July 1, 2018. See Iowa Code \u00a7 3.7(1). At that time, abortion was still legal in Iowa through approximately twenty-two weeks LMP. See Iowa Code \u00a7 146B.2(2)(a). 22. Before the 2018 Six-Week Ban could take effect, this Court entered a temporary injunction preventing the State from enforcing the ban, thereby allowing abortion to remain legal in Iowa through approximately twenty-two weeks LMP. See Ord. Entering Temp. Injunction, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland , No. EQCE83074 (June 4, 2018). This Court subsequently entered a permanent injunction against the 2018 Six-Week Ban. See Ruling on Mot. for Summ. J., Planned Parenthood of the Heartland , No. EQCE83074 (Jan. 22, 2019). 23. More than three years later, soon after the United States Supreme Court ruled in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , 142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022), that the federal Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, the State moved this Court for an order dissolving this Court's permanent injunction against the 2018 Six-Week Ban. See Mot. to Dissolve Perm. Injunction Issued January 22, 2019, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland , No. EQCE83074 (Aug. 11, 2022). 24. Following a hearing, this Court denied the State's motion to dissolve the permanent injunction against the 2018 Six-Week Ban, recognizing that the law was \"a ban on nearly all abortions\" and would violate the Iowa Constitution under the undue burden standard. See Ruling on Mot. to Dissolve Perm. Injunction Issued January 22, 2019, Planned Parenthood of the E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 7 Heartland , No. EQCE83074 (Dec. 12, 2022). The State then appealed this Court's ruling to the Iowa Supreme Court. 25. On June 16, 2023, an evenly divided Supreme Court affirmed this Court's ruling by operation of law, allowing the permanent injunction against the 2018 Six-Week Ban to remain in effect. See Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. , No. 22-2036 (June 16, 2023). Abortion has thus remained legal in Iowa through approximately twenty-two weeks LMP. The Act 26. On July 5, 2023, less than three weeks after an evenly divided Iowa Supreme Court allowed this Court's permanent injunction against the 2018 Six-Week Ban to remain in effect, Governor Reynolds issued a proclamation calling the Iowa General Assembly into a one-day special session on July 11 \"for the sole and single purpose\" of enacting a new ban on abortion. See Ex. B. 27. The Governor's proclamation noted that the Supreme Court's order had prevented the State from enforcing the 2018 Six-Week Ban, and asserted that \"Iowans deserve to have their legislative body address the issue of abortion expeditiously and all unborn children deserve to have their lives protected by their government as the fetal heartbeat law did.\" Id. 28. The General Assembly met in a one-day special session on July 11, 2023. In the span of a single day, the General Assembly introduced, debated, and passed the Act. Each chamber debated the Act for less than seven hours, and before debate on the Senate floor was complete, proponents of the bill forced a vote at around 11:00 p.m., in the dead of night. 29. Shortly before midnight on July 11, Governor Reynolds announced that she plans to sign the Act into law on Friday, July 14. See Ex. C. 30. The Act will take effect immediately upon Governor Reynolds's signature. See HF 732 \u00a7 3. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 8 31. Just like the 2018 Six-Week Ban, the Act bans abortions when there is a \"detectable fetal heartbeat.\" HF 732 \u00a7 2(2)(a). The Act defines a \"fetal heartbeat\" as \"cardiac activity, the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart within the gestational sac.\" Id. \u00a7 1(2). Because embryonic or fetal cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks LMP, the Act bans abortions starting at approximately six weeks LMP. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 13. 32. When a pregnant person seeks an abortion, the Act requires the abortion provider to perform an abdominal ultrasound to detect whether there is cardiac activity and to inform the patient in writing both (1) whether cardiac activity was detected; and (2) that if cardiac activity was detected, the patient cannot have an abortion. See HF 732 \u00a7 2(1)(a)-(b). The Act then requires the patient to sign a form acknowledging that they received this information. See id. \u00a7 2(1)(c). The Act also requires abortion providers to retain in the patient's medical record documentation of the ultrasound, documentation of whether cardiac activity was detected, and the patient's signed form. See id. \u00a7 2(3)(a)-(b). 33. The Act allows for only a few narrow exceptions under which either a provider need not test for cardiac activity, or a patient can have an abortion despite the detection of cardiac activity. First, an exception applies if the provider determines in their \"reasonable medical judgment\" that there is a \"medical emergency,\" which existing Iowa law defines as occurring either when (1) the patient's \"life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy, but not including psychological conditions, emotional conditions, familial conditions, or the woman's age\"; or (2) \"when continuation of the pregnancy will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function defined elsewhere.\" Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1(4), 2(2)(a); Iowa Code \u00a7 146A.1(6)(a). 34. Second, an exception applies if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest and the E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 9 patient reports the rape or incest to law enforcement or to a \"public or private health agency which may include a family physician.\" HF 732 \u00a7\u00a7 1(3)(a)-(b), 2(2)(a). To qualify for the exception, the rape must have been reported within 45 days; incest must have been reported within 140 days. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1(3)(a)-(b). This exception is no longer available once the pregnancy reaches a \"postfertilization age\" of \"twenty or more weeks\"\u2014approximately twenty-two weeks LMP or later. Id. \u00a7 2(2)(b). 35. The Act uses the word \"rape\" without defining the term, even though \"rape\" is not a crime defined elsewhere in the Iowa Code, which instead uses the terms \"sexual abuse\" and \"sexual assault.\" Iowa Code of KellyMarie Z. Meek (\"Meek Aff.\") \u00b6 22. The Act also does not define the term \"incest,\" which is defined in the criminal code as a sex act with \"an ancestor, descendant, brother or sister of the whole or half blood, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew.\" Iowa Code \u00a7 726.2. It is unclear whether this definition of \"incest\" includes, for example, a sex act with a stepsibling or stepparent. See Meek Aff. \u00b6 21. Nor does the Act define the term \"private health agency,\" which is not defined elsewhere in the Iowa Code; the Act thus fails to provide sufficient clarity about the types of institutions or medical providers to which a patient needs to have reported rape or incest. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 63. 36. Third, an exception applies if the provider certifies that there is a \"fetal abnormality\" that is \"incompatible HF 732 \u00a7\u00a7 1(3)(d), 2(2)(a). As with the exception for reported rape and incest, this fetal abnormality exception is no longer available once the pregnancy reaches approximately twenty-two weeks LMP. Id. \u00a7 2(2)(b). 37. The Act also lists as an exception \"[a]ny spontaneous abortion, commonly known as a miscarriage, if not all of the products of conception are expelled.\" See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1(3)(c), 2(2)(a). 38. The Act provides that, after a pregnancy has reached twenty weeks post-E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 10 fertilization\u2014approximately twenty-two weeks LMP\u2014an abortion may be performed despite the detection of cardiac activity if \"the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of an unborn child.\" See id. \u00a7 2(2)(b). 39. The Act does not specify what penalties providers could face for a violation. It does, however, require the Iowa Board of Medicine to adopt rules to administer the Act. See id. \u00a7 2(5). The Board of Medicine has the authority to discipline providers for violating a state law, including by imposing civil penalties of up to ten thousand dollars and revoking their medical licenses. See Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 148.6(1), (2)(c); Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 272C.3(2). Abortion in Iowa Abortion Is Safe, Common, and Critical to Pregnant People's Health & Welfare 40. Access to safe and legal abortions is critical to pregnant people's health and welfare. Legal abortions are one of the safest procedures in modern medicine, and are far safer than childbirth at any stage in pregnancy. Abortions are also very common: approximately one in four women in this country will have an abortion by age forty-five, and this number does not account for the trans men, gender nonconforming people, and nonbinary people who also have abortions. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 22. 41. People decide to have abortions for a variety of reasons, including familial, medical, financial, and personal ones. Most people who seek abortions are already parents, and they may struggle with basic unmet needs for their families. Some people end a pregnancy because they conclude that it is not the right time in their lives to have a child or to add to their families. Others have an abusive partner or a partner with whom they do not wish to have children for other reasons. Some people have health complications during pregnancy that lead them to conclude that an abortion is the right choice for them; indeed, for some, abortion is medically indicated to protect their lives or health, including their reproductive health. Some do so because they receive E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 11 diagnoses of fetal abnormalities despite the pregnancy being wanted. In some cases, people are dealing with a substance use disorder and decide not to become parents or have additional children during that time in their lives. Some make that decision because they have become pregnant as a result of rape. Others do so because they choose not to have biological children. See id. \u00b6 23; Meek Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 10-16. 42. Childbirth poses far greater health risks than abortion. Every pregnancy-related complication is more common among people having live births than among those having abortions. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 22. 43. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine\u2014a private nonprofit organization established by the United States Congress to provide objective advice to the nation on matters of science and technology\u2014conducted a review of the existing high-quality research and concluded that abortion is safer than childbirth. See id. \u00b6 49. The National Academies found that the national abortion-related mortality rate was only 0.7 deaths per 100,000 legal abortions, a rate more than twelve times lower than that for those who carried their pregnancies to term, which is 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births. See id. 44. Those forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term are at increased risk of preterm birth and failure to bond with a newborn, and are less likely to escape poverty, less likely to be employed, less likely to escape domestic violence, and less likely to formulate and achieve educational, professional, and other life goals. Additionally, when pregnant people lack access to safe, legal abortion, some will attempt to self-induce an abortion, including in ways that can further jeopardize their health or life. See id. \u00b6 58. Most People Who Seek Abortions Do Not Know They Are Pregnant by Six Weeks LMP 45. In a typical pregnancy, embryonic or fetal cardiac activity can be detected by an ultrasound as early as six weeks LMP. The vast majority of patients who have an abortion in Iowa E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 12 have reached at least six weeks LMP by the time of the abortion. 46. As an increasing number of states have banned or severely restricted abortion in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs, patients have faced substantial obstacles in seeking care and have been forced to delay their abortions later into their pregnancies. See id. \u00b6 36. 47. In 2022, more than eighty-eight percent of the abortions that PPH provided were for patients who had already reached six weeks LMP; and approximately ninety-two percent of the abortions that PPH provided during the first half of 2023 were for patients who had already reached six weeks LMP. See id. \u00b6 20. 48. From October 2021 through September 2022, approximately ninety-four percent of the abortions that EGC provided were for patients who had already reached six weeks LMP. See Affidavit of Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, M.D. (\"Hardy-Fairbanks Aff.\") \u00b6 16. During the following year, from October 2022 through May 2023, approximately ninety-nine percent of the abortions that EGC provided were for patients who had already reached six weeks LMP. See id. 49. There are many reasons why most pregnant people do not have an abortion until six weeks LMP or later. Many do not even know that they are pregnant by six weeks LMP, and even those who do often face substantial financial and logistical obstacles to having an abortion. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 16. 50. For a person with regular monthly periods who becomes pregnant, fertilization typically occurs two weeks after their last menstrual period (two weeks LMP). Another two weeks would pass before a person would miss their period, generally the first clear indication of a possible pregnancy\u2014at this point, the pregnancy would have reached four weeks LMP. At-home pregnancy tests are not generally effective until at least four weeks LMP. See id. \u00b6 26. 51. As a result, even a person with highly regular menstrual cycles of approximately E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 13 twenty-eight days who learns that they are pregnant at the earliest possible instance would have roughly two weeks to (1) decide whether to have an abortion; (2) secure an appointment at one of the few available health centers in Iowa that provide abortions, which do not provide abortions every day of the week; (3) take time off from work and arrange transportation, childcare, and care for other family members; (4) obtain state-mandated counseling materials; (5) wait twenty-four hours; and (5) go to a health center to have an abortion. See id. \u00b6 29. 52. Moreover, although patients who have abortions demonstrate a strong level of certainty with respect to their decisions, the Act will force even those patients who successfully navigate the above hurdles to race to a health center to avoid missing the extremely narrow window when an abortion is available. Thus, under the Act some Iowans may be forced to rush into their decision out of fear that they will lose the opportunity altogether to have an abortion. 53. The above obstacles apply to pregnant people who learn very early that they are pregnant. But many patients do not know they are pregnant until six weeks LMP or later, especially patients who have irregular menstrual cycles, cycles longer than approximately twenty-eight days, or who experience bleeding during early pregnancy, a common occurrence that is frequently and easily mistaken for a period. Other patients may not develop or recognize symptoms of early pregnancy. Other factors, including younger age and use of hormonal contraceptives, can also result in delayed recognition of symptoms of early pregnancy. See id. \u00b6 27-28. 54. Particularly for patients living in poverty or without insurance, travel-related and financial barriers also pose a barrier to having an abortion before six weeks LMP. With very narrow exceptions, Iowa bars coverage of abortion in its Medicaid program, see id. \u00b6 31, forcing patients living in poverty or without private insurance to make difficult tradeoffs among other basic needs like food or rent to pay for their abortions. Many must seek financial assistance from extended family and friends or from local abortion funds to pay for care, a process that takes time. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 14 Moreover, many patients must navigate other logistics, such as inflexible or unpredictable job hours and childcare needs, that may delay the time when they are able to have an abortion. See id. \u00b6 32. 55. In addition to the medical and practical impediments to accessing an abortion, Iowa has also enacted numerous medically unnecessary statutory and regulatory requirements that must be met before a patient may have an abortion. For example, Iowa law requires PPH to ensure that patients have an ultrasound at least twenty-four hours before having an abortion. See Iowa Code \u00a7 146A.1(a)-(c). Patients must also have available, at least twenty-four hours before an abortion, certain state-mandated information designed to discourage them from having an abortion. See id. \u00a7 146A.1(d). As a result, a patient makes two trips to a health center before they can receive an abortion. Practically speaking, the effect of this twenty-four-hour delay law can last far longer than one day, which may push a patient past the time limit even if they discovered they are pregnant, decided to have an abortion, and scheduled an appointment prior to six weeks LMP. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 33. 56. Accessing abortions is even more difficult for minors. Minor patients without a history of pregnancy may be less likely to recognize early symptoms of pregnancy than older patients who have been pregnant before. Most of these patients cannot immediately obtain written parental authorization, which means that under Iowa law they cannot have an abortion until forty- eight hours after a parent has been notified or until they have obtained judicial authorization, neither of which can realistically happen before six weeks LMP. See id. \u00b6 34. Impact of the Act on Petitioners and Their Patients The Act Has Decimated Access to Abortion in Iowa 57. By banning abortions at the earliest stages of pregnancy, the Act will decimate access to abortion in Iowa and thereby impose an undue burden on Petitioners' patients. The Act E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 15 is particularly devastating for lower-income Iowans, people of color, and rural Iowans, who already face inequities in access to health care. 58. The Act bans abortions starting at approximately six weeks LMP. At six weeks LMP, many people do not know that they are pregnant, and even those who do may not yet have decided to have an abortion and been able to make the necessary financial and logistical arrangements to have an abortion that early in pregnancy. The Act thus prohibits the vast majority of abortions in Iowa. 59. The vast majority of people in Iowa who have an abortion do so once their pregnancies have already reached six weeks LMP. As described above, approximately ninety-two percent of the abortions that PPH has provided in Iowa in 2023 were for patients who had already reached six weeks LMP, see id. \u00b6 20, and approximately ninety-nine percent of the abortions that EGC provided between October 2022 and May 2023 were for patients who had already reached six weeks LMP, see Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 16. 60. The Act's few limited exceptions will do little to help patients seeking an abortion in Iowa. The Act's rape and incest exceptions require patients to have reported the rape or incest to law enforcement or a health agency within limited time windows, a step that very few people who seek an abortion for a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest will have taken. Victims of rape and incest often do not report the incidents, whether due to their young age, fear of violence or retaliation by their assailant, or severe trauma and shame. See Meek Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 25-28. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, approximately seventy-eight percent of rapes and sexual assaults were not reported to the police in 2021. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 64; Meek Aff. \u00b6 26. Moreover, the exception is no longer available once the pregnancy reaches approximately twenty-two weeks LMP. See HF 732 \u00a7 2(2)(b). The vast majority of Iowans who seek an abortion for a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest thus will not be able to rely on these exceptions. See Meek Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 16 20-29. 61. Similarly, the Act's \"medical emergency\" exception will do little to help patients seeking an abortion in Iowa under dire health circumstances. The Act relies on a definition of \"medical emergency\" that excludes all psychological conditions, even conditions so severe that the patient is at an immediate risk of self-harm or suicide, even though mental health conditions are the leading underlying cause of twenty-three percent of pregnancy-related deaths. See HF 732 Iowa Code \u00a7 146A.1(6)(a); Traxler Aff. \u00b6 66. And even for physical conditions, the Act uses vague definitions, placing providers in the untenable position of having to decide whether an exception applies while knowing that they could lose their license if the Board of Medicine disagrees with their conclusion. See HF 732 \u00a7 2(5); Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 148.6(1), (2)(c); Iowa Code \u00a7 272C.3(2). Patients with rapidly worsening medical conditions may be forced to wait for care until a provider determines that their conditions become deadly or threaten substantial and irreversible impairment so as to meet the exception. The Act Forces Pregnant Iowans to Leave the State or Carry Their Pregnancies to Term 62. If the Act goes into effect, the vast majority of Iowans who decide to have an abortion will either have to travel out of state or, if they do not have the resources to do so, carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. 63. Those who are forced to travel out of state to seek an abortion will face significant logistical and financial obstacles in doing so, causing substantial delays in their access to a critical form of health care. Research shows that legal barriers to abortion can delay, and in some cases altogether prevent, people from accessing that care. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 42. 64. Pregnant Iowans will be forced to take time off from work, arrange care for their children and other family members, and figure out how to travel to the nearest state where they can legally access an abortion, which may be hundreds of miles from their homes. Many will also E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 17 have to do so in secret to hide their decision from an abusive partner. They will also be forced to gather extra funds\u2014in addition to the cost of the abortion itself\u2014to pay for the lodging, gas, and food required to make these trips, cover the cost of care for their children and other family members, and account for the time off from work, forcing lower-income Iowans to make difficult choices between an abortion and rent, food, and other basic necessities. And because some nearby states such as Kansas and Nebraska require patients to make multiple trips to a health center to have an abortion, many Iowans will have to either make multiple trips to or have an extended stay in another state, further increasing the logistical and financial obstacles and causing additional delays to accessing care. 65. All of these logistical and financial obstacles will force pregnant Iowans to delay their abortions further into pregnancy, which can increase the risk of complications and prevent them from being able to access the abortion method that they feel most comfortable with. For instance, a patient might prefer to have a medication abortion instead of a procedural abortion because they feel more comfortable and safe undergoing the process in the privacy of their own homes, but if the patient is delayed in accessing care because they are forced to travel to another state, they may reach a point in gestation at which only procedural abortions are available. Similarly, a patient who might otherwise have been eligible for a procedural abortion by aspiration may instead have to undergo a dilation and evacuation procedural abortion if they are delayed in seeking care. And although abortion is very safe and is safer than childbirth at any stage in pregnancy, the risk of complications associated with an abortion increases as the pregnancy progresses, causing pregnant Iowans to face an increased risk of complications the longer their abortion is delayed. 66. For some pregnant Iowans, these obstacles will prove impossible to overcome. Some may choose to self-manage their abortions outside of the healthcare system, potentially E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 18 increasing the risks to their health. Others will be forced to carry their pregnancies to term against their will. Iowans Forced to Carry Pregnancies to Term Will Face Risks of Death, Major Complications, and Social and Financial Hardships 67. Those who are forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term will be exposed to an increased risk of death and major complications. Even under ideal circumstances, pregnancy causes significant physiological changes that can affect a person's health and social circumstances both during the pregnancy and for years afterwards. Many people seek emergency care at least once during a pregnancy, and people with comorbidities (either preexisting or those that develop as a result of their pregnancy) are significantly more likely to need emergency care. See id. \u00b6 45. 68. During pregnancy, even people without preexisting health conditions will experience significant physiological changes, including a dramatic increase in blood volume, faster heart rate, increased production of clotting factors, breathing changes, digestive complications, and a growing uterus, putting them at greater risk of blood clots, nausea, hypertensive disorders, anemia, and other complications. See id. \u00b6 44. 69. Pregnancy can present even greater health risks to those with preexisting health conditions, such as hypertension and other cardiac diseases, diabetes, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, obesity, asthma, and other pulmonary diseases. See id. \u00b6 46. 70. Pregnancy can also lead to the development of new serious health conditions, such as hyperemesis gravidarum, preeclampsia, deep-vein thrombosis, and gestational diabetes. People who develop new conditions during pregnancy are at an even higher risk of developing the same conditions in subsequent pregnancies. See id. 71. Pregnancy may also induce or exacerbate mental health conditions. Those with a history of mental illness may experience a recurrence during pregnancy. Moreover, pregnant E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 19 people taking medication for a mental health condition may need to discontinue or modify their medication regimen to avoid risking harm to the fetus, increasing the likelihood that mental illness recurs both during and after pregnancy. These risks can be higher for patients with unintended pregnancies, who may face physical and emotional changes and risks that they did not choose to take on. Pregnant people with a history of mental health conditions also face a heightened risk of postpartum illness, which may go undiagnosed for months or even years. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 47, 52. 72. Some pregnant people also face an increased risk of intimate partner violence, with the severity sometimes escalating during or after pregnancy. Homicide is a leading cause of maternal mortality; the majority of these homicides are committed by an intimate partner. Moreover, if forced to carry to term, a person facing intimate partner violence may also find it more difficult to leave an abusive partner because of new financial, emotional, and legal ties with that partner. See id. \u00b6 48. 73. Labor and childbirth are also significant medical events with risks of health complications and death, far greater than those for abortions. In some cases, labor must be induced, and labor can last hours or sometimes days and be tremendously painful. Even a pregnancy with no comorbidities or previous complications can suddenly become life-threatening during labor and delivery. For example, during labor, increased blood flow to the uterus places the patient at risk of hemorrhage and, in turn, death. Hemorrhage is the leading cause of severe maternal morbidity. Other unexpected adverse events include transfusion, a ruptured uterus, perineal laceration, and unexpected hysterectomy. The most severe perineal tears involve tearing between the vagina through the anal sphincter and into the rectum and must be surgically repaired, which can result in long-term urinary and fecal incontinence and sexual dysfunction. Moreover, vaginal delivery often leads to long-term internal injuries, such as bowel injury or injury to the pelvic floor, which can also lead to urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse. See id. \u00b6 50. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 20 74. Some people who are forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term may also need to undergo a cesarean delivery, an open abdominal surgery that requires hospitalization and entails a significant risk of complications such as hemorrhage, infection, venous thromboembolism (blood clots), and injury to internal organs. Cesarean deliveries can also create long-term risks, including an increased risk of placenta previa in later pregnancies (when the placenta covers the cervix, resulting in vaginal bleeding) and bowel or bladder injury in future deliveries. See id. \u00b6 51. 75. Particularly for people with low incomes or who are facing economic hardship, pregnancy can have severe impacts on their and their families' financial security. Some side effects of pregnancy render patients unable to work, or unable to work the same number of hours that they otherwise would, sometimes resulting in job loss. And pregnancy-related health care and childbirth are some of the costliest hospital-based health services, particularly for complicated or at-risk pregnancies. Beyond childbirth, raising a child is expensive, due to both direct costs and lost wages. These costs can be particularly impactful for people who do not have partners or other support systems in place, such as single parents. See id. \u00b6 55. 76. Even after childbirth, those who are forced to carry their pregnancies to term and their newborns will be at risk of negative health consequences, including reduced use of prenatal care, lower breastfeeding rates, and poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. When compared to those who are able to access abortions, women who seek but are denied an abortion are more likely to moderate their future goals and less likely to be able to exit abusive relationships. Their existing children are also more likely to suffer measurable reductions in achievement of child developmental milestones and an increased chance of living in poverty. Finally, as compared to women who received an abortion, women who are denied abortions are less likely to be employed full-time, more likely to be raising children alone, more likely to receive public assistance, and more likely to not have enough money to meet basic living needs. See id. \u00b6 58. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 21 CLAIMS FOR RELIEF COUNT I - RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS 77. Petitioners hereby reaffirm and reallege each and every allegation made above as if set forth fully herein. 78. The Act violates the due process rights of patients seeking and obtaining abortions in the state of Iowa, as guaranteed by article I, section 9 of the Iowa Constitution, by banning the vast majority of abortions in Iowa. COUNT II - INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF PERSONS 79. Petitioners hereby reaffirm and reallege each and every allegation made above as if set forth fully herein. 80. The Act violates the inalienable rights of persons, as guaranteed by article I, section 1 of the Iowa Constitution, by banning the vast majority of abortions in Iowa. COUNT III - RIGHT TO EQUAL PROTECTION 81. Petitioners hereby reaffirm and reallege each and every allegation made above as if set forth fully herein. 82. The Act violates Petitioners' and their patients' rights to equal protection of the laws in the state of Iowa, as guaranteed by article I, sections 1 and 6 of the Iowa Constitution, by: (a) singling out abortion from all other medical procedures; and (b) discriminating against women on the basis of their sex and on the basis of gender stereotypes. PRAYER FOR RELIEF: DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 83. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of all previous paragraphs as though those allegations were fully set forth herein.

KIM REYNOLDS, ex rel. STATE OF IOWA, and IOWA BOARD OF MEDICINE, Respondents. Case No. _________ PETITIONERS' EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF COME NOW Petitioners, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. (\"PPH\"), Sarah Traxler, M.D., and the Emma Goldman Clinic (\"EGC\"), respectfully move this court for a grant of temporary injunctive relief pursuant to Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.1502, on an immediate and emergency basis, to take effect upon Governor Kim Reynolds's signing House File 732 (the \"Act\"),1 and state: 1. On July 11, 2023, Governor Reynolds convened a special session of the General Assembly, during which the General Assembly passed the Act. 2. On July 11, 2023, Governor Reynolds announced that she will sign the Act on July 14, 1 In 2017, the General Assembly passed Senate File 471, a bill imposing a mandatory 72-hour delay requirement and an additional trip requirement on people seeking abortions, which also included an immediate effective date. See 2017 Senate File 471. Governor Terry Branstad announced he would sign the bill into law on May 5, 2017; because of its immediate effective date, PPH filed a motion for a temporary injunction to enjoin the law two days earlier, on May 3, 2017. See Pet. for Decl. J. and Injunctive Relief, \u00b6 1, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds, No. EQCE81503 (Polk Cnty. Dist. Ct. May 3, 2017) (filed as Planned Parenthood of the Heartland v. Branstad ). This Court set a hearing on the motion for the following day, May 4, before the law went into effect. See Order Setting Hearing on Mot., id. After the hearing, this Court issued a ruling that would \"become effective immediately upon the governor signing the bill.\" Ruling on Pls.' Pet. For Temp. Inj. at 4, id. Similarly, Petitioners in this case request that the Court issue a temporary injunction, to take effect upon Governor Reynolds's signing the Act on July 14, 2023. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT2 2023. See Press Release, Office of Gov. Kim Reynolds, Gov. Reynolds Statement on Special Session to Protect Life (July 11, 2023), https://governor.iowa.gov/press- release/2023-07-11/gov-reynolds-statement-special-session-protect-life. 3. The Act has an immediate effective date. Absent expedited temporary relief, when the Act goes into effect, it will prohibit the vast majority of Iowans from accessing abortion. The Ban will irreparably harm Petitioners and their patients, and there is no adequate legal remedy. 4. The Act bans abortion if embryonic or fetal cardiac activity can be detected, which can occur starting at approximately six weeks of pregnancy, as measured from the first day of a patient's last menstrual period (\"LMP\"), before many people know they are pregnant. Affidavit of Sarah Traxler, M.D. (\"Traxler Aff.\") \u00b6 13. The vast majority of abortions in Iowa occur after six weeks LMP: nearly 92% of the abortions PPH provided in Iowa in the first half of 2023 and 99% of the ones EGC provided between October 2022 and May 2023 were for patients whose pregnancies had already reached six weeks LMP. Traxler Aff. \u00b6 20; Affidavit of Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, M.D. (\"Hardy- Fairbanks Aff.\") \u00b6 16. 5. Therefore, in practical effect, the Act would prohibit the vast majority of abortions in Iowa. 6. The Act does not specify the penalties providers could face for a violation, but the Iowa Board of Medicine has the authority to discipline providers for violating a state law, including by imposing civil penalties of up to ten thousand dollars and revoking their medical licenses. See House File 732 \u00a7 2(5); Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 148.6(1), E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT3 7. The Ban violates Petitioners' patients' right to access abortion under the Due Process Clause and Inalienable Rights Clause of the Iowa Constitution. Iowa Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9. 8. The number of people harmed by this law is overwhelming: in 2022, PPH provided over 3300 abortions in Iowa, and from October 2021 to September 2022, EGC provided 703 abortions. Traxler Aff. \u00b6 20; Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 4. 9. The Iowa Supreme Court has recognized that abortion restrictions must satisfy the undue burden test to pass constitutional muster. Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Iowa Bd. of Med. , 865 N.W.2d 252, 263, 269 (Iowa 2015) (\" PPH I\"); Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds , 975 N.W.2d 710, 716 (Iowa 2022) (\"PPH IV\") (holding that undue burden \"remains the governing standard\"); Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds , No. 22-2036, slip op. at 6 (Iowa June 16, 2023) (\" PPH V\") (\"[T]he undue burden test remains the governing standard.\") (Waterman, J., non-precedential op.). 10. The Act does not satisfy the undue burden standard. At oral argument before the Iowa Supreme Court in April, the State conceded that the six-week ban the General Assembly passed in 2018, which was virtually identical to the Act, did not satisfy the undue burden test. Oral Argument at 2:56, PPHV V , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NvW74QAl2s; see also PPH V, slip op. at 13 (noting it is \"clear and indeed conceded by the State at oral argument\" that the 2018 ban does not satisfy the undue burden standard) (Waterman, J., non-precedential op.). 11. Temporary injunctive relief under Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.1502 is appropriate when necessary \"to maintain the status quo of the parties prior to final judgment and to protect E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT4 the subject of the litigation.\" Kleman v. Charles City Police Dep't, 373 N.W.2d 90, 95 (Iowa 1985). Such relief is appropriate if the movant demonstrates: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a threat of irreparable injury; and (3) that the balance of harms favors relief. See generally Opat v. Ludeking , 666 N.W.2d 597, 603-04 (Iowa 2003); v. Iowa Realty Co., Inc. , 621 N.W.2d 178, 181 (Iowa 2001). 12. As explained more fully in Petitioners' Brief in Support , filed herewith, Petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Act violates their patients' rights under the Due Process Clause and Inalienable Rights Clause of the Iowa Constitution. 13. The constitutional violations themselves constitute irreparable harm. See LS Power Midcontinent, LLC v. State , 988 N.W.2d 316, 338 (Iowa 2023). Further, the Act will harm Petitioners' patients, who will be forced to remain pregnant against their will or to overcome substantial obstacles to seek abortions outside the state. The Act will also irreparably harm Petitioners and their medical providers and other staff members, who will no longer be able to provide medical care consistent with their medical judgment and in support of patient well-being. 14. While the Ban will cause severe harm to Petitioners and their patients, Respondents will not suffer any harm if Petitioners' patients continue to have access to abortion, as they have for over fifty years. 15. Finally, there is no adequate legal remedy. See Ney v. Ney , 891 N.W.2d 446, 452 (Iowa 2017). The Ban will cause grievous injury to each person denied an abortion under it, and such injuries cannot later be compensated by damages. 16. For the reasons set forth above, and incorporating all the arguments set forth in their concurrently filed Brief in Support of Motion for Temporary Injunctive Relief, E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT5 Petitioners are entitled to the preliminary relief they seek as necessary to protect the legal rights of their patients, as well as their patients' immediate health and safety while this case proceeds toward final resolution. WHEREFORE , Petitioners pray that this Court issue an order to take effect upon Governor Kim Reynolds's signing House File 732, ENJOINING Respondents and their agents, employees, appointees, and successors from enforcing House File 732 during the pendency of this case. Petitioners request a hearing on this motion at the earliest possible date.

See Ruling on Mot. for Summ. J., Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds, No. EQCE83074 (Polk Cnty. Dist. Ct. Jan. 22, 2019); Affidavit of Sarah A. Traxler, M.D. (\"Traxler Aff.\") \u00b6 13. In December 2022, this Court reaffirmed that the 2018 Six-Week Ban violated the Iowa Constitution, recognizing that it was \"a ban on nearly all abortions,\" and denied the State's motion to dissolve the permanent injunction. See Ruling on Mot. to Dissolve Perm. Injunction Issued Jan. 22, 2019, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds , No. EQCE83074 (Polk Cnty. Dist. Ct. Dec. 12, 2022). Just last month, the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed by operation of law, allowing this Court's ruling to remain in effect. See Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds , No. 22-2036 (Iowa June 16, 2023) (\" PPH V\"). The ink on the Iowa Supreme Court's order was barely dry before Governor Reynolds called a special session of the Iowa General Assembly to enact a new abortion ban. See Proclamation of Special Session (July 5, 2023). During this one-day special session on July 11, 2023, the General Assembly passed House File 732 (\"HF 732\" or \"the Act\"), a law virtually identical to the 2018 Six-Week Ban that again bans abortions upon the detection of embryonic or fetal cardiac activity. The General Assembly rushed to introduce, debate, and pass the Act as quickly as it could. Each chamber debated the Act for less than seven hours, and the entire special session, from convening to passage of the Act by both chambers, took less than a day\u2014less than the twenty-four hours that Iowa law requires patients to wait before having an abortion, see Iowa Code \u00a7 146A.1. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 2 Shortly thereafter, Governor Reynolds issued a statement in response to the passage of the Act, stating that she will sign it into law on Friday, July 14, 2023. See Press Release, Office of Gov. Kim Reynolds, Gov. Reynolds Statement on Special Session to Protect Life (July 11, 2023), https://governor.iowa.gov/press-release/2023-07-11/gov-reynolds-statement-special-session- protect-life. The Act will take effect immediately upon Governor Reynolds's signature. See HF 732 \u00a7 3. The Act bans the vast majority of abortions in Iowa: nearly 92% of the abortions that Petitioner Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. (\"PPH\") provided in Iowa in the first half of 2023 and 99% of the ones that Petitioner Emma Goldman Clinic (\"EGC\") provided between October 2022 and May 2023 took place once the patients' pregnancies had already reached six weeks LMP. Traxler Aff. \u00b6 20; Affidavit of Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, M.D. (\"Hardy-Fairbanks Aff.\") \u00b6 4.1 The Act blatantly violates the Iowa Constitution. This case is squarely controlled by precedent from the Iowa Supreme Court holding that abortion restrictions must be evaluated under the undue burden standard. See Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds , 975 N.W.2d 710, 716 (Iowa 2022) (\" PPH IV\"); Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds , 865 N.W.2d 252 (Iowa 2015) (\" PPH I\"). The Act cannot survive the undue burden test. It bans the vast majority of abortions in Iowa, forcing people seeking an abortion to carry a pregnancy to term against their will, travel out of state to access care at great cost to themselves and their families, or attempt to self-manage their abortions outside the medical system. The Act is an affront to the dignity and health of Iowans. In particular, it is an attack on families with low incomes, 1 The affidavits accompanying this motion cite to both Senate File 579 and House File 732 or to \"SF 579/HF 732.\" During the special session, these identical bills were debated simultaneously. Ultimately, the House passed HF 732 and transmitted it to the Senate, which substituted HF 732 for SF 579 and passed it. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 3 Iowans of color, and rural Iowans, who already face inequities in access to health care and who will bear the brunt of the law's cruelties. Petitioners PPH, EGC, and Sarah Traxler, M.D. (collectively, \"Petitioners\") seek a temporary injunction to prevent the widespread and irreparable harm that the Act will inflict each day it is in effect on Petitioners' patients and on their medical providers and other staff members. Petitioners have 200 patients scheduled for abortion services in the weeks of July 10 and 17. If the Act goes into effect, they will not be able to provide abortions to most of those patients. FACTUAL BACKGROUND PPH and EGC are the only abortion providers that operate health centers in Iowa. Traxler Aff. \u00b6 21. PPH operates eight health centers throughout Iowa, and in 2022, it provided over 3300 abortions in the state. Id. \u00b6 20. EGC is a clinic in Iowa City that, between October 2021 and September 2022, provided 703 abortions. Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 4. Legal abortion is one of the safest procedures in contemporary medical practice, and it is much safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 22. It is also very common: nearly one in four women will have an abortion by age 45, and this number does not account for the transgender men, gender nonconforming people, and nonbinary people who have abortions. See id. Patients' decisions to have an abortion often involve multiple considerations that reflect the complexities of their lives. See id. \u00b6 23. Many are already parents, and they decide to have an abortion based on what is best for them and their existing families. See id. Others decide that they are not ready to become parents because they are too young or want to finish school before starting a family. See id. Some patients conclude that abortion is the right choice for them because of health complications during pregnancy or a life-limiting fetal diagnoses, or because they have an abusive partner or a partner with whom they do not wish to have children. See id. Access to legal abortion E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 4 is critical for the welfare of pregnant people. On July 5, 2023, less than three weeks after an evenly divided Iowa Supreme Court allowed this Court's permanent injunction against the 2018 Six-Week Ban to remain in effect, Governor Reynolds issued a proclamation calling the Iowa General Assembly into a special session on July 11 \"for the sole and single purpose\" of enacting a new ban on abortion. See Proclamation of Special Session. The Governor's proclamation noted that the Supreme Court's ruling had prevented the State from enforcing the 2018 Six-Week Ban, and asserted that \"Iowans deserve to have their legislative body address the issue of abortion expeditiously and all unborn children deserve to have their lives protected by their government as the fetal heartbeat law did.\" Id. at 2. The General Assembly met in a special session on July 11, 2023. Debate in each chamber lasted less than seven hours, and before debate on the floor of the Senate was complete, proponents of the bill forced a vote at around 11:00 p.m., in the dead of night. The entire session\u2014from convening of the special session to passage of the Act by both chambers of the General Assembly\u2014took less than a day. Governor Reynolds announced she will sign the Act into law on Friday, July 14, 2023. See Press Release, Gov. Reynolds Statement on Special Session to Protect Life, supra at 2. Just like the 2018 Six-Week Ban, the Act bans abortions when there is a \"detectable fetal heartbeat.\" HF 732 \u00a7 2(2)(a). When a pregnant person seeks an abortion, the Act requires the abortion provider to perform an abdominal ultrasound to detect whether there is cardiac activity and to inform the patient in writing both (1) whether cardiac activity was detected; and (2) that if cardiac activity was detected, the patient cannot have an abortion. Id. \u00a7 2(1)(a)-(b). The Act then requires the patient to sign a form acknowledging that they received this information. Id. \u00a7 2(1)(c). The Act's references to a \"fetal heartbeat\" are inaccurate and misleading. The Act defines E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 5 \"fetal heartbeat\" as \"cardiac activity, the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart within the gestational sac\" and bans abortions if a \"fetal heartbeat\" is detected via ultrasound. Id. \u00a7 1(2). Cardiac activity may be detected via abdominal ultrasound as early as six weeks LMP. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 13. At this very early stage of pregnancy, cardiac activity is merely an electrical pulse; nothing that could be considered a \"heart\" has yet formed. See id. Further, despite the Act's use of the term \"fetal heartbeat,\" a pregnancy is still an embryo when cardiac activity may first be detected, not a fetus; the developing pregnancy is an embryo until at least ten weeks LMP, only after which the term \"fetus\" is used. See id. \u00b6 12. Because embryonic or fetal cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks LMP, the Act bans abortions starting at approximately six weeks LMP. See id. \u00b6 13. By banning abortions so early in pregnancy, the Act will prevent the vast majority of people from having an abortion in Iowa. See id. \u00b6 16. Although most abortion patients get an abortion as soon as they are able, nearly 92% of the abortions PPH provided in Iowa during the first half of 2023\u2014and 99% of the ones EGC provided between October 2022 and May 2023\u2014took place after six weeks LMP. See id. \u00b6 20; Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 16. Even for patients with regular four-week menstrual cycles, six weeks LMP is only two weeks past the first missed period. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 26. Further, many people do not know that they are pregnant by six weeks LMP for a wide variety of reasons, including because of irregular menstrual cycles as a result of common medical conditions, contraceptive use, age, and breastfeeding; because implantation of a fertilized egg can cause light bleeding, which is often mistaken for a period; and because pregnancy is not always easy to detect. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. And even those who do know they are pregnant by six weeks LMP will face substantial logistical and financial obstacles in arranging to have an abortion in Iowa before their time runs out, including raising money for the abortion and arranging time off work, transportation, E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 6 childcare, and care for other family members. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 29-32. The Act allows for only a few narrow exceptions under which either a provider need not test for cardiac activity or a patient can have an abortion despite the detection of cardiac activity. First, an exception applies if the provider determines in their \"reasonable medical judgment\" that there is a 2(2)(a); Iowa Code \u00a7 146A.1(6)(a). Second, an exception applies if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest and the patient reports the rape or incest to law enforcement or to a \"public or private health agency which may include a family physician\" within a limited time window (45 days for rape, and 140 days for incest). HF 732 \u00a7\u00a7 1(3)(a)-(b), 2(2)(a). This exception is no longer available once the pregnancy reaches a \"postfertilization age\" of \"twenty or more weeks\"\u2014approximately twenty-two weeks LMP or later. Id. \u00a7 2(2)(b). Third, an exception applies if the provider certifies that the fetus has a \"fetal abnormality\" that is \"incompatible with judgment.\" Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1(3)(d), 2(2)(a). As with the exception for reported rape and incest, this fetal abnormality exception is no longer available once the pregnancy reaches approximately twenty-two weeks LMP. Id. \u00a7 2(2)(b). Further, the Act includes several unclear provisions that will cause needless confusion for Petitioners and their patients. The General Assembly rushed to pass the Act in less than one day, without making changes to the enjoined 2018 law necessary to avoid uncertainty.2 Notably, the 2 For example, the Act requires the Board of Medicine to promulgate regulations to administer the ban, id. \u00a7 2(5), but the Board of Medicine has not yet done so. This provision was copied verbatim from the 2018 Six-Week Ban, Iowa Code \u00a7 146C.2(5), but that bill did not have an immediate effective date. See 2018 Senate File 359. By including an immediate effective date, the General Assembly eliminated the time built into the 2018 Six-Week Ban for the Board of Medicine to promulgate rules. Moreover, the Board of Medicine's ability to make rules has been hamstrung by Governor Reynolds's executive order issuing a \"moratorium on rulemaking.\" Exec. Order No. 10, \u00a7 IV, https://governor.iowa.gov/media/182/download?inline. And for abortions \"necessary to preserve the life of an unborn child\"\u2014which appears to refer to abortions necessary to preserve the life of a twin fetus\u2014the Act nonsensically includes E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 7 rape and incest exceptions in the Act do not provide sufficient clarity about when they apply. The Act fails to define its use of the word \"rape,\" even though \"rape\" is not a crime defined elsewhere in the Iowa Code, which instead uses the term \"sexual abuse,\" Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 709.1 et seq. The Act also does not define \"incest,\" which is defined in the criminal code as a sex act with \"an ancestor, descendant, brother or sister of the whole or half blood, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew,\" Iowa Code \u00a7 726.2, leaving it unclear whether the term includes, for example, a stepsibling or stepparent. Further, the rape and incest exceptions require that the incident be reported \"to a law enforcement agency or to a public or private health agency which may include a family physician.\" HF 732 \u00a7\u00a7 1(3)(a)-(b). The Act does not define \"private health agency\" or \"family physician,\" leaving unclear whom a survivor needs to report to in order to qualify for an abortion. Reporting rape or incest, even to a medical provider, can be retraumatizing for survivors. Meek Aff. \u00b6 24. The Act fails to give survivors the clarity they need to access abortion care, and it fails to give abortion providers the clarity they need to determine whether they can provide the requisite care to this vulnerable population. The rape and incest exceptions language was copied verbatim from the 2018 Six-Week Ban, Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 146C.1(4)(a)-(b). As Justice Waterman explains in his non-precedential PPH V opinion, \"when the statute was enacted in 2018, it had no chance of taking effect. To put it politely, the legislature was enacting a hypothetical law.\" PPH V, slip. op. at 10 (Waterman, J., non-precedential op.). As such, the 2018 General Assembly did not draft the 2018 Six-Week Ban with the care needed to ensure clarity were it to take effect. And Petitioners raised these issues in the litigation about the 2018 ban. Petition, \u00b6 28, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds, No. EQCE83074 (Polk Cnty. Dist. Ct. filed May 15, 2018); Appellees' Final Brief at 23 these among the abortions allowed after twenty weeks post-fertilization, id. \u00a7 2(2)(b), but not those allowed from six weeks LMP up to twenty weeks post-fertilization, id. \u00a7 2(2)(a). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 8 n.1, PPH V. Nonetheless, the General Assembly again refused to fix these flaws when it passed the Act. The Act also fails to specify what penalties providers could face for a violation. It does, however, require the Iowa Board of Medicine to adopt rules to administer the Act. HF 732 \u00a7 2(5). The Board of Medicine has the authority to discipline providers for violating a state law, including by imposing civil penalties of up to ten thousand dollars and revoking their medical licenses. See Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 148.6(1), (2)(c); Iowa Code \u00a7 272C.3(2). LEGAL STANDARD Under Rule 1.1502 of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure, temporary injunctive relief is appropriate when necessary \"to maintain the status quo of the parties prior to final judgment and to protect the subject of the litigation.\" Kleman v. Charles City Police Dep't, 373 N.W.2d 90, 95 (Iowa 1985). Such relief is appropriate if the movant demonstrates: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a threat of irreparable injury; and (3) that the balance of harms favors relief. See generally Opat v. Ludeking , 666 N.W.2d 597, 603-04 (Iowa 2003); 100 L.C. v. Iowa Realty Co., Inc., 621 N.W.2d 178, 181 (Iowa 2001). ARGUMENT I. PETITIONERS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS OF THEIR CLAIMS. A. The Act violates the Iowa Constitution's Due Process Clause because it imposes an undue burden on the right to abortion. The Iowa Supreme Court has addressed the status of abortion restrictions under the Iowa Constitution several times since 2015, but the applicable level of scrutiny is clear: as Justice Waterman unequivocally stated in PPH V last month, \"the undue burden test remains the governing standard.\" PPH V, slip op. at 6 (Waterman, J., non-precedential op.). The Act E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 9 unquestionably imposes an undue burden on the right to abortion and therefore violates Petitioners' patients' substantive due process rights under the Iowa Constitution. In 2015, the Iowa Supreme Court applied the undue burden standard3 to hold that a ban on telemedicine medication abortions violated the Iowa Constitution. See PPH I , 865 N.W.2d at 262- 69. The Court later held that abortion restrictions should be reviewed under strict scrutiny. See Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds , 915 N.W.2d 206 (Iowa 2018) (\" PPH II\"). The Court subsequently overturned PPH II's holding that strict scrutiny applies, but it explicitly held that the undue burden standard articulated in PPH I remains the \"governing standard.\" PPH IV, 975 N.W.2d at 716. It explained, \"[A]ll we hold today is that the Iowa Constitution is not the source of a fundamental right to an abortion necessitating a strict scrutiny standard of review for regulations affecting that right.\" Id. (emphasis added). In PPH IV, the Court expressly declined to hold that the rational basis standard applied, even though an amicus curiae requested that it do so. Id. at 745. In fact, two justices specifically dissented on this point, stating that they would direct the trial court on remand to apply rational basis. Id. at 746 (McDermott, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Unlike rational basis, the undue burden standard accounts for the competing interests at stake in the abortion context. See PPH V , slip op. at 21 (\"The undue burden test balances the state's interest in protecting unborn life and maternal health with a woman's limited liberty interest in 3 The undue burden standard from Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833 (1992), governed abortion restrictions under the United States Constitution before the United States Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , 597 U.S. ___, 142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022). The standard has parallels in other constitutional contexts in which the Iowa Supreme Court has rejected strict scrutiny but adopted a standard of review higher than rational basis scrutiny. See, e.g., Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm. v. Pate , 950 N.W.2d 1, 7 (Iowa 2020) (election law); State v. Musser , 721 N.W.2d 734, 743 (Iowa 2006) (commercial speech and content-neutral regulations of speech). And Iowa's adoption of the undue burden standard allows Iowa courts to draw on the ample federal precedent applying the standard between Casey and Dobbs. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 10 deciding whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.\") (Waterman, J., non-precedential op.); PPH 249-50 (Mansfield, J., dissenting) (\"The fact that there are two profound concerns\u2014a woman's autonomy over her body and human life\u2014has to drive any fair-minded constitutional analysis of the problem. . . . Casey's undue burden standard was not an unprincipled decision by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter 'to deviate downward' in constitutional jurisprudence. It was an effort to recognize the unique status of this particular constitutional conflict between a woman's autonomy and respect for human life.\"). Notably, the Iowa Supreme Court chose not to wait for the United States Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs before issuing its decision reiterating the undue burden standard, even though Mississippi had asked the United States Supreme Court to overrule Casey many months before\u2014 not to mention that Justice Alito's draft opinion in Dobbs already had become public. The United States Supreme Court ultimately decided Dobbs\u2014a federal constitutional case\u2014one week after PPH IV, but Dobbs did not change PPH IV's holding that the undue burden test remains the standard under the Iowa Constitution. In PPH IV, the Court noted that the opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court could inform how it should rule, but also made clear that it \"zealously guard[s] [its] ability to interpret the Iowa Constitution independently of the Supreme Court's interpretations of the Federal Constitution.\" PPH IV, 975 N.W.2d at 716, 745-46. After Dobbs, the State petitioned the Iowa Supreme Court for rehearing in an effort to convince the Court to establish rational basis as the new standard of review in abortion rights cases. Appellants' Pet. for Reh'g, PPH IV (No. 21-0856). The Court summarily rejected this invitation to set a new and lower standard of review than the federal undue burden standard applied in PPH I. Pet. for Reh'g Denied, PPH IV (No. 21-0856); see also PPH V, slip op. at 18 (describing the petition for rehearing as an \"attempt at a shortcut to adopting Dobbs\") (Waterman, J., non-precedential op.). Indeed, as Justice E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 11 Waterman noted in his non-precedential PPH V opinion, \"To date, not a single state supreme court that previously recognized protection for abortion under its state's constitution has overruled its precedent in light of Dobbs to adopt rational basis review.\" PPH V, slip op. at 19 (Waterman, J., non-precedential op.). Because the opinions of the evenly divided Iowa Supreme Court in PPH V are non- precedential, the undue burden standard that the Iowa Supreme Court left in place in PPH IV remains the governing standard. See id. at 6 (\"[T]he undue burden test remains the governing standard . . . .\") (Waterman, J., non-precedential op.). As this Court explained last December when it denied the State's motion to dissolve the injunction against the 2018 Six-Week Ban, PPH IV \"was clear in its holding that 'for now, this means that the Casey undue burden test [the court] applied in PPH I remains the governing standard.'\" Ruling on Mot. to Dissolve Perm. Injunction at 14 (alteration in original). This Court therefore concluded that the 2018 Six-Week Ban \"would be an undue burden and, therefore, the statute would still be unconstitutional and void.\" Id. at 15. The same is true of the Act in this case. It puts in place not just a substantial\u2014but a complete\u2014obstacle in the path of Iowans seeking pre-viability abortions after all but the earliest stages of pregnancy. The Act provides an extremely narrow window for Iowans to confirm a pregnancy; decide whether to have an abortion; secure an appointment at one of the few available health centers in Iowa that provide abortions, which do not provide abortions every day of the week; take time off from work and arrange transportation, childcare, and care for other family members; obtain an ultrasound and state-mandated counseling materials; wait twenty-four hours; and have an abortion. The Act will prevent the vast majority of Iowans from having access to E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 12 abortion. There can be no doubt, therefore, that it imposes an undue burden. Indeed, at oral argument before the Iowa Supreme Court in April, the State conceded as much.4 Moreover, every single court that has considered a pre-viability abortion ban under an undue burden standard has concluded that the ban is unconstitutional. See, e.g., MKB Mgmt. Corp. v. Stenehjem T. v. Edwards , 974 F.2d 27, 31 (5th Cir. 1992) (total ban); Guam Soc'y of Obstetricians 1368-69, (9th Cir. 1992) (total ban); Planned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Wilson , 2020 24, 2020) (6-week ban); SisterSong Women of Color Reprod. Justice Collective v. Kemp, 472 F. Supp. 3d 1297, 1312 (N.D. Ga. 2020) (6-week No. 2:19- cv-365, 2019 WL 5556198, at *3 (M.D. Oct. 29, 2019) (total ban); Preterm-Cleveland v. Yost , 394 (M.D.N.C. 2019) ban).5 The burdens that the Act imposes on patients' access to abortions are not alleviated by the limited scope of its exceptions and the muddled, confusing language it uses to frame these exceptions, which impact some of the most vulnerable patients. For example, the Act's failure to define \"rape\" and \"incest,\" its arbitrary requirements that rape be reported within 45 days and 4 Oral Argument at 2:56, PPH V, available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvW74QAl2s; see also PPH V, slip op. at 13 (noting it is \"clear and indeed conceded by the State at oral argument\" that the 2018 Six-Week Ban does not satisfy the undue burden standard) (Waterman, J., non-precedential op.). 5 Because these cases were decided under the federal undue burden standard, they were abrogated by Dobbs. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 13 incest within 140 days, and its unclear requirement that the reporting be done to a \"public or private health agency which may include a family physician,\" HF 732 \u00a7 1(3)(a)-(b), all put substantial obstacles in the way of survivors of rape and incest. The Act would thus cause confusion among survivors about whether they qualify for an abortion. The Act's incorporation of the definition of \"medical emergency\" from Iowa Code \u00a7 146A.1(6)(a), HF 732 \u00a7 1(4), which expressly excludes abortions provided because of the pregnant person's \"psychological conditions, emotional conditions, familial conditions, or . . . age,\" would also prevent access to abortions for particularly vulnerable patients. Thus, the Act unduly burdens the right to abortion even for patients who may fall within the scope of the exceptions, and Petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge under the Due Process Clause. B. Petitioners are likely to succeed on their claims under the Iowa Constitution's Inalienable Rights Clause. PPH I and PPH IV were decided under the Due Process Clause of article I, section 9. Substantive due process offers ample protection for abortion rights under the Iowa Constitution. Cf. PPH IV , 975 N.W.2d at 737 (\"[S]tates relying on the due process clauses of their state constitutions typically have applied the undue burden test.\") (alteration in original) (quoting PPH II, 915 N.W. 2d at 254 (Mansfield, J., dissenting). But this clause does not stand alone in protecting the right to abortion under the Iowa Constitution. Accord Women of State of Minn. by Doe v. Gomez, 542 N.W.2d 17, 26 (Minn. 1995) (recognizing fundamental right to abortion under combination of several clauses of Minnesota Constitution). The right to abortion is also protected under article I, section, 1 of the Iowa Constitution, the Inalienable Rights Clause. Article I, section 1 provides, \"All men and women are, by nature, free and equal, and have certain inalienable rights\u2014among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 14 acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\" Iowa Const. art.

No \"mere appendage,\" the section was \"purposefully placed at the beginning of the Bill of Rights\" and \"makes the point of emphasizing 'inalienable rights,' . . include[] rights that cannot be abrogated by the legislature, or this court.\" Baldwin v. City of Estherville , 915 N.W.2d 259, 285 (Iowa 2018) (Appel, J., dissenting).6 The clause's use of the word \"among\" shows that the list of inalienable rights is not exhaustive. See Hodes & Nauser, MDs, P.A. v. Schmidt , 440 P.3d 461, 473 (Kan. 2019) (interpreting the use of the word \"among\" in a similar clause of the Kansas Constitution to mean the list of rights \"was not intended to be exhaustive\"); Bruce Kempkes, The Natural Rights Clause of the Iowa Constitution: When the Law Sits Too Tight , 42 Drake L. Rev. 593, 636 (1993) (\"[The] drafters [of the Inalienable Rights Clause] chose to use language more detailed and more encompassing than the grand endowment of rights set forth earlier in the Declaration of Independence and later in the Fourteenth Amendment.\"). The sweeping language in article I, section 1, encompasses a broad right to bodily autonomy. Accordingly to a scholarly article on the provision, the clause \"protects those preferred personal freedoms that include expression, associate, assembly, spirituality, and privacy,\" in other words \"the right to personal autonomy, . . . the right of an individual to seek his or her own answers, or the right to self-ownership,\" and these freedoms \"implicate, among other things, the right of a person to decide . . . whether to bear a child.\" Id. at 640-42 (internal quotation marks and citations 6 Although Iowa courts typically use the rational basis test when applying article I, section 1, see Garrison v. New Fashion Pork LLP , 977 N.W.2d 67, 83 (Iowa 2022) (collecting cases); PPH IV, 975 N.W.2d at 743 n.23, the Iowa Supreme Court has cited its protections to buttress guarantees found in other parts of the Iowa Constitution. See, e.g., McQuistion v. City of Clinton , 872 N.W.2d 817, 830 n.6 (Iowa 2015) (\"[E]qual protection law arises out of the confluence of article I, section 1 and article I, section 6.

E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 15 omitted). Courts in other states have recognized abortion protections under similar clauses of their constitutions. See, e.g., Hodes & Nauser , 440 P.3d at 471 (per curiam) (\"[S]ection 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights acknowledges rights that are distinct from and broader than the United States Constitution and that our framers intended these rights to be judicially protected against governmental action that does not meet constitutional standards.

Further, in 1998, an overwhelming majority of the Iowa electorate voted to amend article I, section 1 to expressly include women. Iowa Const. amend.

Notably, unlike the Iowa Constitution, neither the Kansas Constitution nor the New Jersey Constitution expressly includes women in their guarantees of inalienable rights, and yet both state supreme courts nevertheless recognized that a fundamental right to abortion exists under their constitutions.

I, \u00a7 1 (guaranteeing \"certain natural and unalienable rights\" to \"[a]ll persons\")).8 In PPH IV, the Court took into account the historical context to determine the meaning of the Iowa Constitution, ultimately concluding that abortion was not a fundamental right subject to strict scrutiny because around the time of the Iowa Constitution's ratification in 1857, abortion was prohibited in many circumstances from 1843 to 1851 and from 1858 until Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. 975 N.W.2d at 740-41. By that same reasoning, the historical context at the time of the 1998 amendment leads to the conclusion that the amendment encompasses the right to abortion and the undue burden standard. Further, in Bechtel v. City of Des Moines , 225 N.W.2d 326 (Iowa 1975), the Iowa Supreme Court ascertained the meaning of the home-rule amendment 8 Much of the language of article 1, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, is substantially identical to article 1, section 1 of the Iowa Constitution. Compare N.J. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1 (\"All persons are by nature free and independent, and have certain natural and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\") with Iowa Const. art. I, \u00a7 1. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 17 by turning to \"[t]he individuals who were in the forefront of the struggle to obtain\" the amendment, who were \"in the best position to know the intent of the framers.\" Id. at 333. The individuals at the forefront of the fight to add \"women\" to article I, section 1 included elected officials publicly associated with the fight for abortion rights. For example, Representative Minnette Doderer, who according to contemporaneous reports, was a \"driving force behind the effort,\" Associated Press, Flap Erupts Over Rights Language , Des Moines Register, June 10, 1998, at 1M, also publicly supported abortion rights. See Jonathan Roos, Abortion Bill Survives Test in Legislature , Des Moines Register, Feb. 19, 1998, at 4A (noting Rep. Doderer's opposition to an abortion restriction); Quote of the Day, Des Moines Register, Feb. 19, 1998, at 3A (quoting Rep. Doderer as urging lawmakers to vote against abortion restriction, saying, \"You're not going to go to hell either way you vote\"); Rekha Basu, Doderer Wears Label Proudly , Des Moines Register, Feb. 21, 1997, at 1T (reporting that Rep. Doderer wore the label of \"feminist\" proudly and that \"the abortion issue . . her into 'conscious feminism.'\"). Similarly, Senator Elise Szymoniak, who less than a month before the election was reported as having \"been with the movement since the beginning,\" Pat Denato, Women Would Belong Everywhere, Even in the Constitution , Des Moines Register, Oct. 11, 1998, at 3E, also publicly supported abortion. See Thomas A. Fogarty, Abortion Bill OK'd by State Senate , Des Moines Register, Feb. 6, 1998, at 4A (front page story quoting Sen. Szymoniak as saying, \"If you stop legal abortion, you won't stop abortion; you'll only make it more difficult\"); Quote of the Day , Des Moines Register, Feb. 6, 1998, at 4M (quoting her as saying \"[t]here will be women who die\" as a result of an abortion ban). The public involvement of Rep. Doderer and Sen. Szymoniak in the campaign lends further support to the connection between the amendment and abortion rights. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 18 In the words of a supporter of the amendment before the election, \"[W]ith two words\u2014 'and women'\u2014women will take their rightful place in the Iowa Constitution. And we, as Iowans will say that we believe people should be free to pursue their life goals\u2014whatever their gender.\" Stephanie R. Pratt, Fixing a 131-Year-Old Constitutional Omission , Des Moines Register, Oct. 18, 1998, at 5AA. Article I, section 1's broad guarantees of inalienable rights, including a specific guarantee of these rights to women, protects Iowans' right to bodily autonomy, including the right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. Because the challenged Act would strip the rights of women to control their bodies and their lives, see PPH IV , 975 N.W.2d at 746 (\"[A]utonomy and dominion over one's body go to the very heart of what it means to be free.\") (quoting PPH II, 915 N.W.2d at 237), Petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their article I, section 1 claim.9 9 Petitioners focus here on their claims under the Due Process and Inalienable Rights Clauses, but the Act also violates the Iowa Constitution's equal protection guarantee. For classifications based on pregnancy, Iowa courts apply intermediate scrutiny, not strict scrutiny. See Quaker Oats Co. v. Cedar Rapids Human Rights Comm'n , 268 N.W.2d 862, 866-67 (Iowa 1978) (\"[A]ny classification which relies on pregnancy as the determinative criterion is a distinction based on sex.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)), superseded on other grounds by Iowa Code \u00a7 216.19 (2009); accord N.M. Right to Choose/NARAL v. Johnson , 975 P.2d 841, 854 (N.M. 1998). The undue burden standard is an intermediate level of scrutiny that balances the unique interests at stake in the abortion context. See PPH II , 915 N.W.2d at 249 (noting balance of concerns that \"underlies the 'undue burden' standard set forth in Casey) (Mansfield, J., dissenting); see also Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Strict Judicial Scrutiny , 54 UCLA L. Rev. 1267, 1299 (2007) (referring to the undue burden test as \"a form of intermediate scrutiny\"). Further, the undue burden test effectuates the understanding of equal protection in PPH IV. In PPH IV, the Court recognized that \"being a parent is a life-altering obligation that falls unevenly on women in our society.\" 975 N.W.2d at 746 (quoting PPH II, 915 N.W.2d at 249 (Mansfield, J., dissenting)). Because abortion restrictions threaten the bodily autonomy of women, applying rational basis would be inappropriate. See PPH V , slip op. at 21 (declining to apply rational basis because \"[i]t would be ironic and troubling for our court to become the first state supreme court in the nation to hold that trash set out in a garbage can for collection is entitled to more constitutional protection than a woman's interest in autonomy and dominion over her own body.\") (Waterman, J., non-precedential op.). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 19 II. THE ACT WILL IRREPARABLY HARM PETITIONERS AND THEIR PATIENTS \"Iowa Rule of Civil Procedure 1.1502(1) permits a temporary injunction to prevent irreparable harm to the movant.\" LS Power Midcontinent, LLC v. State , 988 N.W.2d 316, 338 (Iowa 2023). In a determination of whether injunctive relief is warranted, \"each case must rest on its own peculiar facts.\" Johnson v. Pattison , 185 N.W.2d 790, 798 (Iowa 1971). Here, the irreparable harm requirement is met because Petitioners have shown, see supra , that they are \"likely to succeed in showing a constitutional violation,\" which itself constitutes irreparable harm. LS Power Midcontinent , 988 N.W.2d at 338. Additionally, their harms cannot be remedied by monetary damages. IES Utilities Inc. v. Iowa Dep't of Revenue and Finance , 545 N.W.2d 536, 541 (Iowa 1996) (stating that monetary loss is \"insufficient under most circumstances to be considered irreparable injury\"). If the Act goes into effect, it will be catastrophic for Iowans. It will force many people seeking abortions to carry their pregnancies to term against their will, with all of the physical, emotional, and financial costs that entails. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 43-58. Some will inevitably turn to self-managed abortions, which may in some cases be unsafe. See id. \u00b6 60. And even Iowans who are ultimately able to get an abortion\u2014either because they have been able to scrape together resources to travel out of state or if they are one of the very few who can satisfy one of the law's narrow exceptions\u2014will suffer irreparable harm. See id. \u00b6 43-70. Finally, Petitioners and their staff will also suffer harms that cannot possibly be compensated after judgment. A. Petitioners and their patients will suffer irreparable harm from forced pregnancy. The Act threatens severe, actual, and irreparable harm to Iowans' lives and livelihood\u2014 harms that are more than sufficient to justify a temporary injunction. If the Act takes effect, Petitioners will be forced to turn away the vast majority of patients seeking abortions. See id. \u00b6 20; E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 20 Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 16. Petitioners have 200 patients scheduled for abortion services for the weeks of July 10 and 17, and few, if any, will fall within the Act's narrow exceptions. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 20; Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 13-15. Iowans will be forced to carry their pregnancies to term and give birth. See Traxler Aff . \u00b6 43. For these patients, who will suffer a range of physical, mental, and economic consequences, there is no effective monetary remedy after judgment for the impact of forced pregnancy and loss of bodily autonomy. See Curtis 1000, Inc. v. Youngblade , 878 F. Supp. 1224, 1248 n.24 (N.D. Iowa 1995) (irreparable harm may be found in situations that \"involve imminent health or safety risks\"). Even an uncomplicated pregnancy challenges a person's entire physiology. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 44; Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 10. And many pregnant people experience complications. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 49-52. Pregnancy can cause new and serious health conditions or aggravate pre- existing health conditions. See id. \u00b6 46. It can also induce or exacerbate mental health conditions, which are explicitly excluded from the Act's \"medical emergency\" exception. See id. 1(4); Iowa Code \u00a7 146A.1(6)(a). Some pregnant patients also face an increased risk of intimate partner violence\u2014including possible homicide, with the severity sometimes escalating during or after pregnancy. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 48. Indeed, homicide, most frequently caused by an intimate partner, is a leading cause of maternal mortality. See id. Separate from pregnancy, labor and childbirth are themselves significant medical events with many risks. See id. \u00b6 49; Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 10. Maternal mortality has been rising in the United States, and the risk of mortality associated with childbirth is more than twelve times higher than that associated with abortion. See Hardy-Fairbanks \u00b6 10; Traxler Aff. \u00b6 22. The health risks of childbirth also go beyond mortality. Complications from labor and childbirth occur at a rate of over 500 per 1,000 delivery hospital stays. See Traxler Aff . \u00b6 50. Even a normal pregnancy with E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 21 no comorbidities or complications can suddenly become life-threatening during labor and delivery. See id. Patients of color are even more at risk for negative pregnancy and childbirth-related health outcomes. In 2021, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was 2.6 times the maternal mortality rate for white women. See id. \u00b6 49; Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 10. The disparity is even higher in Iowa, with Black mothers six times more likely to die than white mothers. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 49. The Act will make it more difficult for all pregnant patients to receive quality health care. Iowa already has the fewest number of OB/GYN specialists per capita of any state in the country, and abortion bans cause OB/GYNs to move elsewhere and make it harder to recruit quality medical students. See Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 11. If the Act takes effect, it will also lead to long-term negative impacts for people forced to give birth and for their existing children. More than half of Petitioners' abortion patients already have one or more children. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 23; Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 5. Women who seek but are denied an abortion are, when compared to those who are able to access abortion, more likely to moderate their future goals, and less likely to be able to exit abusive relationships. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 58; Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 12 Their existing children are also more likely to suffer measurable reductions in achievement of child developmental milestones and an increased chance of living in poverty. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 58. As compared to women who received an abortion, women denied an abortion are also less likely to be employed full-time, more likely to be raising children alone, more likely to receive public assistance, and more likely to not have enough money to meet basic living needs. See id. The economic impact of forced pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting will also have potentially exponential, negative effects on Iowa families' financial stability. Some side effects of pregnancy render people entirely unable to work, or unable to work the same number of hours as E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 22 they otherwise would. See id. \u00b6 53. Pregnancy-related discrimination can also result in lower earnings for women during pregnancy, and the impacts of discrimination during pregnancy continue over time. See id. \u00b6 54 Further, Iowa does not require private employers to provide paid family leave, meaning that for many pregnant Iowans, time taken to recover from pregnancy and childbirth or to care for a newborn is unpaid. See id. On average, a person in Iowa who takes four weeks of unpaid leave could lose more than $3,000 in income. See id. Pregnancy-related health care and childbirth are also some of the costliest hospital-based health services, particularly for complicated or at-risk pregnancies. See id. \u00b6 55. While insurance may cover most of these expenses, many pregnant patients with insurance must still pay for significant labor and delivery costs out of pocket, impacting a patient's existing children and other dependents. See id. Beyond childbirth, raising a child is expensive in terms of direct costs and due to lost wages. See id. \u00b6 56. In sum, pregnancy and parenting are hugely consequential in Iowans' lives, and being denied an abortion has long-term, negative effects on individuals' physical and mental health, economic stability, and the well-being of their families, including existing children. In addition to these physical, mental, and economic injuries, the Act also imposes irreparable harm on Plaintiffs' patients by impinging on one of the most consequential decisions a person will make in a lifetime: whether to become or remain pregnant. See PPH IV , 975 N.W.2d at 746 (\"[A]utonomy and dominion over one's body go to the very heart of what it means to be free.\") (quoting PPH II, 915 N.W.2d at 237). In this way, the Act will have an impact on a person's existing family that cannot be compensated by future monetary damages. Many people decide that adding a child to their family is well worth the risks and consequences of pregnancy and childbirth. Conversely, together with their partners and with the support of other loved ones and trusted E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 23 individuals, thousands of Iowans each year determine that abortion is the right decision for them. Traxler Aff. \u00b6 20. B. The Act will irreparably harm patients forced to try to get abortions outside of Iowa. Although some Iowans forced to remain pregnant may eventually be able to get abortions out of state, they will also suffer irreparable injury if the Act takes effect. First, people will be forced to remain pregnant against their will, with all the attendant risks and medical consequences, until they can get out-of-state abortion care, likely later in pregnancy and at greater expense than if they had had abortion access in Iowa. Id. \u00b6 42. Although abortion is extremely safe and is much safer than labor and childbirth, the medical risks associated with abortion increase with gestational age. Id.. Forcing people to remain pregnant while they save money or arrange logistics to travel out of state exposes them to entirely unnecessary medical risk. Id. It could also mean that a patient who would have been eligible for a medication abortion may have to undergo a procedural abortion by aspiration, or a patient who would have been eligible for aspiration abortion may have to have a more involved, longer dilation and evacuation procedure. Second, these Iowans will suffer the additional burdens and costs associated with substantial travel. From Des Moines, for example, the nearest abortion providers outside of Iowa are in Omaha, Nebraska, around 140 miles away.10 Id. \u00b6 40. The closest clinics in Kansas and Minnesota are over 200 miles away from Des Moines. Id. The burdens associated with travel will have the greatest impact on Iowans who do not own a car, Iowans with disabilities for whom long- distance travel is especially onerous, and low-income Iowans for whom the cost of gas\u2014and other expenses, such as for childcare\u2014could be prohibitive. 10 Nebraska has enacted a ban on abortion after twelve weeks LMP, meaning that patients past that point in pregnancy will have to travel even further. Neb. Rev. Stat. LB 574 \u00a7 4(2)(b). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 24 Third, some patients may also be forced to compromise the confidentiality of their decision to have an abortion in order to arrange transportation or childcare for their travel to an appointment out of state. Id. \u00b6 41 This could jeopardize the safety of patients whose families and social networks may strongly disapprove of their decision to get an abortion. Each of these impacts constitutes irreparable harm. See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Kan. v. Andersen , 882 F.3d 1205, 1236 (10th of . . . patients' health care cannot be undone after a trial on the merits.\" (internal quotations omitted)); Harris v. Bd. of Supervisors, L.A. Cnty. , 366 F.3d 754, 766 (9th Cir. 2004) (irreparable harm where individuals would experience complications and other adverse effects due to delayed medical treatment); Banks v. Booth , 468 F. Supp.3d 101, 123 (D.D.C. 2020) (same). C. The Act's exceptions do not cure these irreparable harms. Even patients who might meet the Act's limited exceptions will suffer irreparable harm in accessing abortions. Physicians caring for pregnant patients with rapidly worsening medical conditions\u2014who, prior to the Act, could have gotten an abortion without explanation\u2014may be forced to wait for care until their conditions become deadly or threaten substantial impairment of a major bodily function so as to meet the medical emergency exception. Traxler Aff. \u00b6 65. Significantly, the medical emergency exception explicitly excludes psychological conditions including suicidal ideation, despite the fact that mental health conditions are the leading underlying cause of 23% of pregnancy-related deaths. HF 732 \u00a7 1(4); Iowa Code \u00a7 146A.1(6)(a); Traxler Aff. \u00b6 66. This exclusion arguably makes the exception narrower than even Iowa's pre- Roe v. Wade ban, which had no such exclusion. State v. Snyder , 59 N.W.2d 223, 225 (Iowa 1953) (quoting Iowa Code \u00a7 701.1 (1950)11 (banning abortion \"unless such [abortion] shall be necessary to save her 11 This pre- Roe v. Wade ban was repealed by 1976 Iowa Acts 774, \u00a7 526. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 25 life\")). Patients facing devastating fetal diagnoses will only be able to have abortions if the diagnoses are \"incompatible with life.\" HF 732 \u00a7 1(3)(d). For cases in which a fetal diagnosis guarantees that the fetus's life will be tragically short and painful, physicians may fear having their judgment second-guessed as to whether a fetus falls within the scope of the statutory exception. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 67; Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 15. The vast majority of survivors of rape and sexual assault choose not to report their abusers. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 \u00b6 64; Meek Aff. \u00b6 23. These survivors will be faced with choosing between accessing abortion services and maintaining their privacy. HF 732 \u00a7 1(3)(a)-(b). Even the act of reporting an incident of rape or incest could be retraumatizing. See Meek Aff. \u00b6 24. Moreover, rape survivors will only be able to access the exception if they make a report within 45 days of the incident, and incest survivors within 140 days. HF 732 \u00a7 1(3)(a)-(b) . And as explained above, supra Part I.A, the lack of clarity in the rape and incest exceptions will cause confusion for survivors, who may be unsure whether they fall within the scope of the exceptions. D. The Act will irreparably harm Petitioners and their staff. Petitioners and their physicians and staff will also be irreparably injured by the Act, which eliminates their ability to offer abortion to many Iowans who need it. The Act interferes with Petitioners' ability to provide medical care consistent with their medical judgment and in support of patient well-being. See Koelling v. Board of Trustees of Mary Frances Skiff Memorial Hospital , 146 N.W.2d 284, 291 (Iowa 1966) (recognizing the \"right to practice medicine\"). Petitioners and staff will also face reputational harm and harm from the threat of severe civil penalties, including license revocation, posed by the Act. These harms too are irreparable. Medicine Shoppe Intern., Inc. v. S.B.S. Pill Dr., Inc. , 336 F.3d 801, 805 (8th Cir. 2003) (loss of E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 26 reputation can constitute irreparable injury). The threat to Petitioners is particularly grave because of the risk that the Board of Medicine might disagree with decisions they make to provide care under the Act's exceptions. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 63; Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 14. III. The balancing of harms weighs in favor of a temporary injunction. In determining whether to issue a temporary injunction, \"courts consider the 'circumstances confronting the parties and balance the harm that a temporary injunction may prevent against the harm that may result from its issuance.'\" Max 100 L.C. v. Iowa Realty Co., Inc., 621 N.W.2d 178, 181 (Iowa 2001) (quoting Kleman v. Charles City Police Dept. , 373 N.W.2d 90, 96 (Iowa 1985)). Courts \"carefully weigh the relative hardship which would be suffered by the enjoined party upon awarding public relief.\" Matlock v. Weets , 531 N.W.2d 118, 122 (Iowa 1995). This weighing may also be framed as a \"balance of convenience.\" Myers v. Caple , 258 N.W.2d 301, 305 (Iowa 1977). There is no question that the harms to Petitioners and their patients that will be prevented if this Court grants this motion are far greater than any harm to Respondents that could possibly result. All but a few Iowans who might seek abortions will be impacted by the Act, as evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of Petitioners' patients get an abortion after six weeks LMP. See Traxler Aff. \u00b6 20; Hardy-Fairbanks Aff. \u00b6 16. Due to the extreme limitations of the Act's exceptions, see supra Part II.C, few people will be able to qualify for them. Even those patients who are able to leave Iowa to receive care will be irreparably harmed. Supra Part II.B. On the other side, Respondents will face little, if any, injury from issuance of a temporary injunction. A temporary injunction would merely preserve the status quo, under which pre- viability abortion has been legal in Iowa for over half a century. As discussed above, see supra , the Act blatantly violates the Iowa Constitution. Any interest the state has in being allowed to E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT 27 enforce a duly enacted law \"does not apply if the law in question is unconstitutional.\" LS Power Midcontinent , 988 N.W.2d at 339; see also Free the Nipple-Fort Collins v. City of Fort Collins, Colorado , 916 F.3d 792, 807 (10th Cir. 2019) (It is \"always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights.\") (citation omitted). Additionally, granting a temporary injunction will impose no affirmative obligation, administrative burden, or cost upon Respondents. There is no question here that any \"inconvenience the injunction imposes on [Respondents] does not outweigh the harm to [Petitioners] it seeks to prevent.\" Matlock v. Weets 118, 123 (Iowa 1995). CONCLUSION WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray that this Court GRANT their Emergency Motion for Temporary Injunctive Relief and issue an order enjoining Respondents and their agents, employees, appointees, and successors from enforcing House File 732 during the pendency of this case, to take effect upon Governor Kim Reynolds's signing House File 732.12 Petitioners also request a hearing on their motion at the earliest possible date. 12 In 2017, the General Assembly passed Senate File 471, a bill imposing a mandatory 72-hour delay requirement and an additional trip requirement on people seeking abortions, which also included an immediate effective date. See 2017 Senate File 471. Governor Terry Branstad announced he would sign the bill into law on May 5, 2017; because of its immediate effective date, PPH filed a motion for a temporary injunction to enjoin the law two days earlier, on May 3, 2017. See Pet. for Decl. J. and Injunctive Relief, \u00b6 1, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. v. Reynolds, No. EQCE81503 (Polk Cnty. Dist. Ct. May 3, 2017) (filed as Planned Parenthood of the Heartland v. Branstad ). This Court set a hearing on the motion for the following day, May 4, before the law went into effect. See Order Setting Hearing on Mot., id. After the hearing, this Court issued a ruling that would \"become effective immediately upon the governor signing the bill.\" Ruling on Pls.' Pet. For Temp. Inj. at 4, id. Similarly, Petitioners in this case request that the Court issue a temporary injunction, to take effect upon Governor Reynolds's signing the Act on July 14, 2023.

KIM REYNOLDS, ex rel. STATE OF IOWA, and IOWA BOARD OF MEDICINE, Respondents. Case No. _________ AFFIDAVIT OF ABBEY HARDY- FAIRBANKS, M.D. I, Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, M.D., F.A.C.O.G., declare and state as follows: 1. I am the Medical Director of the Emma Goldman Clinic (\"EGC\") and am board- certified in obstetrics and gynecology (\"OB/GYN\") and complex family planning. I provide reproductive health care, including abortion services, to patients of EGC. I am also responsible for training medical students and residents. In addition, I have given academic presentations on medication and in-clinic procedural abortions to family medicine and gynecology physicians. I attach my CV hereto as Exhibit A. 2. I submit this affidavit based on my own personal knowledge in support of Petitioners' Emergency Motion for Temporary Injunctive Relief to enjoin enforcement of Senate File 579 / House File 732 (the \"Act\"). I understand that the Act generally bans abortion as soon as a \"fetal heartbeat\" can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks, as measured from the first day of a patient's last menstrual period (\"LMP\"), with only extremely narrow exceptions. 3. EGC is an independent reproductive health care clinic located in Iowa City. It provides a full range of reproductive health care services, including routine gynecological exams; cancer screenings; STI testing and treatment; a range of birth control options including long-acting E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURTreversible contraception such as intrauterine devices; physical exams for men, transgender, and gender non-conforming people; and abortion services. 4. EGC provides medication abortion through 11 weeks, 0 days LMP. We provide in- clinic abortion procedures through 19 weeks, 6 days LMP. From October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, EGC provided 703 abortions. From October 1, 2022, through May 31, 2023, EGC provided 375 abortions; of those, only 1% were provided before six weeks LMP. 5. My patients choose to have abortions for a variety of reasons. Sometimes their concerns are financial or related to their educational or professional aspirations. Other times they are victims of domestic or sexual abuse. Sometimes they know that carrying a pregnancy to term will harm their own health. In 2022, almost two-thirds of EGC's patients were already parents; they understood what is involved in carrying a pregnancy to term and caring for a child and thought about what is best for their particular situation. In some cases, a wanted pregnancy has complications that makes termination the choice a patient believes is best for their potential child. 6. Even without the Act, abortion is already difficult for many of my patients to access. My patients already face significant financial, legal, and logistical barriers to seeking abortion care. In 2023 to date, 74% of EGC's patients have used our subsidy program, eligibility for which is determined based on household income and access to insurance. In order to access abortions, patients often have to seek financial assistance, find coverage forchild care or elder care duties, and arrange transportation and time off work. Iowa already has medically unnecessary restrictions that make it harder for my patients to access abortions,1and these affect my most 1See Iowa Code. \u00a7 146A.1(a-c) (requiring patients to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours in advance of having an abortion), id. \u00a7 135L.3(1) (requiring a minor's parent to be notified at least 48 hours before a minor can receive an abortion). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURTvulnerable patients the most acutely. These restrictions disrupt provider-patient relationships and are an obstacle to safe and timely medical care. 7. It has become even harder for my patients to access abortions since the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , 142 S.Ct. 2228 (2022). My patients are angry, upset, and confused. Many patients already travel to see us from many hours away or even from out of state, and I worry constantly that for every one of them who makes it to our clinic, there are many who do not. They are calling multiple clinics trying to find the first available appointment, resulting in increased numbers of no-shows and cancellations as appointment availability changes. The increased demand has caused all of our patients to now have to wait two to three weeks to get an abortion, as opposed to one week or less, particularly because EGC only provides abortions one day each week. 8. I am concerned that the Act effectively bans abortion for a vast majority of my patients at EGC who desire to end their pregnancies. Given that many of my patients do not even learn that they are pregnant until after six weeks LMP and that EGC does not regularly see pregnant patients until after embryonic or fetal cardiac activity can be detected, they will not have the chance to choose abortion, even if they otherwise need or want it. My patients will lose their ability to decide their futures and determine what is best for their welfare and that of their families. 9. The Act puts the burden of leaving Iowa to seek reproductive health care\u2014which will impact most those who are most vulnerable. While some patients may be able to leave Iowa and access abortions, I know that many of them will not be able to do so because of the financial, logistical, legal, and other barriers that already make abortions difficult to access. Unwanted pregnancies are especially hard on low-income people, people of color, and people in abusive E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURTrelationships. My patients will be forced to continue their pregnancies, and some of them will face health and safety consequences as a result. 10. Even uncomplicated pregnancies carry health risks, and many pregnancies have complications. Maternal mortality in the United States, unlike in other developed nations, is increasing.2The maternal mortality rate is higher for Black Iowans, who are six times more likely to die than white Iowans.3The risk of death from childbirth is more than twelve times higher than the risk associated with abortion, which is incredibly safe.4 11. The Act will make it harder for pregnant patients, both those who are carrying wanted pregnancies and those who are forced by the Act to remain pregnant against their will, to get high-quality medical care. Abortion bans cause OB/GYNs to move elsewhere and make it harder to recruit quality medical students; I have spoken to medical students who are concerned about being able to get quality training in states with abortion bans.5Additionally, the recruitment of high quality attending physician OB/GYNs will be negatively impacted by this bill, which will 2Donna L.

E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURTbe particularly harmful in Iowa, which has the fewest number of OB/GYN specialists per capita of any state in the country.6 12. Even without health complications, pregnancy and parenting have huge financial and emotional tolls on patients and their families. Being denied wanted abortions results in a lower likelihood of full-time employment and a greater likelihood of not having enough money to meet basic living needs.7People who seek abortions but are denied are also less likely to leave abusive relationships.8I anticipate that instead of carrying an unwanted pregnancy, some patients may seek ways to end their pregnancies without medical supervision, some of which may be unsafe or dangerous. 13. While I understand that the Act contains a narrow exception for patients with a physical condition that threatens their life or poses a \"serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function,\"9this exception is extremely limited. For example, depending on the circumstances, I might hesitate to provide an abortion to a patient based on a physical health risk such as a previous severe pregnancy-related complication. 14. When I am determining whether a patient qualifies for the exception, I will have to balance my desire to protect my patients from harm with my concern that the Board of Medicine might disagree with a decision I make and cause me to lose my license. Working under these circumstances is horrible for patient care and for providers. 6Emily Nyberg, Iowa has the fewest OB-GYN specialists per capita nationwide, regent report reveals, The Daily Iowan (Nov. 9, 2022), available at https://dailyiowan.com/2022/11/09 /iowa- has-the-fewest-ob-gyn-specialists-per-capita-nationwide-regent-report-reveals/. 7Diana Greene Foster et al., Socioeconomic Outcomes of Women Who Receive and Women Who Are Denied Wanted Abortions in the United States , 108 Am. J. Pub. Health 407, 409, 412-13 (2018). 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT15. I have the same concern about how to determine that an embryo or fetus has a condition that is \"incompatible with life,\" or whether a pregnancy is the result of a reported rape.10 These exceptions are not well-defined and reasonable professionals can have different opinions. I also know that many survivors of rape choose not to disclose it, not only to law enforcement but also to health care providers and even people close to them, because of reasons such as trauma or fear or retaliation.11 The exception will not help those rape or incest survivors. 16. The Act will make it more difficult for EGC to care for even those patients who clearly fit within the exceptions. From October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, 94% of the abortions EGC provided were after six weeks LMP, and 99% of the abortions that EGC provided from October 1, 2022, through May 31, 2023 were after six weeks LMP. If the Act went into effect and prevented us from being able to provide abortions in the vast majority of cases, it is highly unlikely that we could maintain the staffing, medical equipment, and supplies necessary to provide abortions. 17. For all of these reasons, I believe that the Act will severely harm EGC and its patients' health and safety. The Court's intervention here is urgently needed: EGC has 55 patients scheduled for the weeks of July 10 and 17, and if the Act goes into effect, a vast majority of them will be forced to cancel their appointments. Thesepatients are already having to deal with terrible uncertainty, and they will not receive abortions if the Act goes into effect. Even a temporary period where the Act is in effect would hurt them; as I discussed, many patients have to deal with financial and logistical difficulties in advance of having an abortion. It is important that EGC be able to reassure our patients that their abortions will go forward. 10 SF 579/HF 732 \u00a7 1(3)(a), (d). 11 See Alexandra Thompson & Susannah N.

KIM REYNOLDS, ex rel. STATE OF IOWA, and IOWA BOARD OF MEDICINE, Respondents. Case No. _________ AFFIDAVITOFSARAHA. TRAXLER,M.D. I, Sarah A. Traxler, M.D., M.S., F.A.C.O.G., declare and state as follows: 1. I am a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist (\"OB/GYN\") licensed to practice medicine in Iowa, in addition to Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Maine. Since 2019, I have been the Medical Director for Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. (\"PPH\"). In that capacity, I oversee all medical services provided by PPH. I also provide contraception and abortion services, including both medication and in-clinic abortion, at PPH's Iowa City, Rosenfield, Council Bluffs, and Sioux City health centers in Iowa. 2. My curriculum vitae, which sets forth my experience and credentials more fully, is attached to this affidavit as Exhibit A. 3. Along with PPH, I am a petitioner in this case. I am familiar with Iowa Senate File 579 / House File 732 (the \"Act\"), the law challenged in this case. I submit this affidavit in support of Petitioners' motion for a temporary injunction. 4. The facts and opinions included here are based on the education, training, practical experience, information, and personal knowledge I have obtained as an OB/GYN and an abortion provider; my attendance at professional conferences; review of relevant medical literature; and E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT2 conversations with other medical professionals. If called and sworn as a witness, I could and would testify competently thereto. My Background 5. As noted above, I am a board-certified OB/GYN. I am licensed to practice medicine in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Maine. 6. I obtained a medical degree in 2009 from Oregon Health and Science University and completed my medical residency at the University of Minnesota. I then completed a fellowship in Contraceptive Research and Family Planning at the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. 7. I hold a Master's Degree in Health Policy Research from the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine and a Bachelor's Degree from Newcomb College. 8. Since 2015, I have been an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota's Medical School, and before that, I was an instructor in Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. 9. I am a fellow and member of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (\"ACOG\") and a member of the American Medical Association, the Society of Family Planning, and Physicians for Reproductive Health, among numerous other professional and scientific societies. 10. As Medical Director, my responsibilities include overseeing all medical services provided by PPH, including abortions performed there, and working with legal and clinical staff to ensure that those medical services are provided in a way that complies with our legal and professional obligations and in accordance with our medical standards and guidelines. As I stated above, I also provide medical services, including abortion, at PPH in Iowa. In addition to serving E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT3 as the Medical Director for PPH, I have been the Chief Medical Officer for Planned Parenthood North Central States (\"PPNCS\") since 2018. In that capacity, I oversee twenty-eight health centers in four states as a strategic executive of our medical program. PPNCS is a voluntary nonprofit corporation whose purpose is to provide high quality, affordable reproductive health care to its community; it serves as the parent organization and provides management and administrative services to PPH. The Challenged Law 11. I understand that the Act generally bans abortion as soon as a \"fetal heartbeat\" is detected. The Act defines \"fetal heartbeat\" as \"cardiac activity, the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart within the gestational sac.\"1 12. The term, therefore, covers not just a \"heartbeat\" in the medical sense, but also early cardiac activity present before development of any cardiovascular system. Moreover, as I understand the Act, a \"fetal heartbeat\" is not actually limited to a fetus. In the field of medicine, the developing organism present in the gestational sac during pregnancy is most accurately termed an \"embryo\" before approximately ten weeks of pregnancy, as measured from the first day of a patient's last menstrual period (\"LMP\"). The term \"fetus\" is used during pregnancy after this time. Contrary to these medical classifications, my understanding is that the Act defines \"unborn child\" to mean \"an individual organism of the species homo sapiens from fertilization [of an egg] to live birth.\"2 13. Accordingly, as I understand the Act, it prohibits abortion any time after identification of embryonic or fetal cardiac activity. Based on my medical experience and 1 SF 579/HF 732 \u00a7 1(2) 2 146A.1. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT4expertise, that activity may be detected by abdominal or vaginal ultrasound as early as six weeks LMP (or even earlier). By that point in pregnancy, an ultrasound may reveal a ring, which represents the round sac within the uterus, and an electrical impulse that appears as a visual flicker on the edge of the sac and therefore, although this isnot what one would think of as a \"heartbeat,\" the Act's restrictions would begin to apply at this extremely early stage.3 This activity cannot be made audible at that stage of pregnancy.4As described further below, many patients do not realize they arepregnant until after six weeks LMP. 14. My understanding is that the bill's exceptions are very narrow. A physician could provide an abortion after embryonic or fetal cardiac activity is detected only if the abortion is necessary to save the patient's life, to prevent extremely limited types of physical harm to the pregnant patient, and in other narrow circumstances involving rape, incest, and fatal fetal anomalies. 15. I understand that the Act does not specify what penalties providers could face for a violation. It does, however, require the Iowa Board of Medicine to adopt rules to administer the Act, which has the authority to discipline providers for violating a state law, including by imposing civil penalties of up to ten thousand dollars and revoking our medical licenses.5 16. As described further below, the Act will have a devastating effect on Iowans, as many patients do not realize they are pregnant until after six weeks LMP. Very few, if any, of the patients with pregnancies with detectable embryonic or fetal cardiac activity will qualify for one of the Act's limited exceptions. I anticipate that patients who can scrape together the resources 3Panos Antsaklis et al., Early Pregnancy Scanning: Step-by-Step Overview , 13 Donald Sch. J. of Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology 236, 237 (2019). 4Saeed Abdulrahman Alnuaimi et al., Challenges and Future Research Directions , 5 Frontiers in Bioengineering & Biotechnology 3 (2017). 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT5 will be forced to travel out of state for medical care, and many others who cannot do so will be forced to carry a pregnancy to term against their will or seek ways to end their pregnancies without medical supervision, some of which may be unsafe. I am gravely concerned about the effect that the Act has on Iowans' emotional, physical, and financial wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families. PPH's Services in Iowa 17. PPH is a not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of Iowa. It operates in both Iowa and Nebraska. In Iowa, PPH operates health centers in Sioux City, Council Bluffs, Ames, Cedar Rapids, Iowa City, Des Moines (Rosenfield and Susan Knapp), and Urbandale. These health centers provide a wide range of reproductive and sexual health services to patients, including but not limited to services such as cancer screenings, birth control counseling, human papillomavirus (\"HPV\") vaccines, annual gynecological exams, contraception, adoption referral, miscarriage management, medication abortion, and in-clinic abortion procedures. 18. Medication abortion involves the use of medication taken to safely and effectively end an early pregnancy in a process similar to a miscarriage. Abortion by procedure involves the use of gentle suction and/or the insertion of instruments through the vagina to empty the contents of a patient's uterus. After eighteen weeks LMP, a two-day procedure is needed. Although sometimes known as \"surgical abortion,\" abortion by procedure does not involve surgery in the conventional sense. It does not require an incision into the patient's skin or a sterile field. 19. PPH provides medication abortion at its Sioux City, Council Bluffs, Ames, Iowa City, and Rosenfield health centers through 11 weeks, 0 days LMP. Medication abortion is provided via telemedicine at the Council Bluffs, Rosenfield, Iowa City, and Sioux City health E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT6 centers. PPH also provides in-clinic abortion procedures through 19 weeks, 6 days LMP at its Rosenfield health center and 20 weeks, 6 days LMP at its Iowa City health center. 20. In 2022, PPH provided over 3,300 abortions in Iowa, more than 88% of which were for patients who had already reached six weeks LMP. In the first half of 2023, PPH provided just under 1,200 abortions in Iowa, nearly 92% of which for patients who had already reached six weeks LMP. Access to and Safety of Abortion in Iowa 21. To my knowledge, PPH is one of only two abortion providers that operate health centers in Iowa. I understand the other provider, the Emma Goldman Clinic, is also a petitioner in this case. 22. Legal abortion is one of the safest procedures in contemporary medical practice.6 Nationally, the risk of death associated with childbirth is more than twelve times higher than that associated with abortion,7 and every pregnancy-related complication is more common among people having live births than among those having abortions.8 Less than 1% of people having abortions experience a serious complication.9The risk of a patient experiencing a complication that requires hospitalization is even lower, approximately 0.3%.10Medication abortion in particular is comparable in safety to over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and to antibiotics. Abortion is also a common medical procedure: Nationally, approximately one in four women will 6See, e.g., Nat'l Acads. of Scis., Eng'g, & Med., The Safety and Quality of Abortion Care in the United States, at 10, 59, 79 (2018), available at http://nap.edu/24950 (hereinafter, \"Nat'l Acads.\"). 7Id. at 75 tbls. 2-4. 8Elizabeth G.

Patients' decisions to have an abortion often involve multiple considerations that reflect the complexities of their lives.12More than half of PPH's Iowa patients who have an abortion are already parents. Our patients with children understand the obligations of parenting and decide to have an abortion based on what is best for them and their existing families, which may already struggle to make ends meet. Other patients decide that they are not ready to become parents because they are too young or want to finish school before starting a family. Some patients have health complications during pregnancy that lead them to conclude that abortion is the right choice for them. Some people receive diagnoses of fetal abnormalities despite the pregnancy being wanted. In somecases, patients are dealing with a substance use disorder and decide not to become parents or have additional children during that time in their lives. Still others have an abusive partner or a partner with whom they do not wish to have children for other reasons. In all of these cases, our patients decide whether abortion is the best option for themselves and their families. 24. Regardless of the reasons that bring a patient to us, PPH and I are committed to providing high-quality, compassionate abortion services that honor each patient's dignity and autonomy. PPH trusts its patients to make the best decisions for themselves, their families, and their futures. 11 Rachel K.

E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT8 Timing of and Barriers to Abortion Services in Iowa 25. Most patients have an abortion as soon as they are able. The majority of abortions in the United States and in Iowa take place within the first trimester of pregnancy.13 26. However, many patients do not learn they are pregnant before six weeks LMP, with many patients facing physiological limitations in pregnancy detection. Some people have fairly regular menstrual cycles; a four-week cycle is common. For a person with a regular four-week cycle, fertilization typically occurs at two weeks LMP. Thus, a person with a highly regular, four- week cycle would already have reached four weeks LMP when a period is missed, and before that time, most over-the-counter pregnancy tests would not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a pregnancy. 27. People can also have cycles of different lengths. Some individuals can go six to eight weeks, or even more, without experiencing a menstrual period. It is also extremely common to have irregular menstrual cycles for a variety of reasons, including certain common medical conditions, contraceptive use, and age.14Breastfeeding can suppress menstruation for weeks or months, after which someone's menstrual cycle may return but be irregular for a period of time. Those who have had a miscarriage in the last six months may also have a higher likelihood of an irregular period contributing to delayed pregnancy detection. Cycle irregularity is more common 13CDCs Abortion Surveillance System FAQs , Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention (\"CDC\"), https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm (last reviewed Nov. 17, 2022) (\"Nearly all abortions in 2020 took place early in gestation: 93.1% of abortions were performed at tation . . . .\"); State of Iowa Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 2021 Vital Statistics of Iowa, at 151 (Apr. 2023), available at https://hhs.iowa.gov/sites/default/files /idphfiles/ vital_stats_2021-20230407.pdf (providing data for abortions performed 0-13 weeks). 14 SeeJessica A.

Internet Rsch. 1 (2020) (study finding that only 25.37% of women had a cycle length variation of less than 1.5 days, and in fact over 30% had a variation period of over six days). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT9among young women, Hispanic women, and women with common health conditions, such as diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome.15 28. Pregnancy itself is not always easy to detect. Some pregnant patients experience light bleeding that occurs when a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus. This implantation bleeding is often mistaken for a menstrual period. Additionally, although some pregnant people experience nausea and vomiting early in pregnancy, many do not. Further, various individual characteristics during pregnancy, including younger age, lower educational attainment, and lower poverty-to-income ratios, are associated with later pregnancy awareness.16 Use of hormonal contraceptives is also associated with delayed pregnancy awareness.17 29. Even after a patient learns of a pregnancy, arranging an appointment for an abortion may take some time. Due to provider availability and other operational demands, PPH's Iowa health centers are able to provide abortion from twice per month to three times per week, depending on the location. As a result, even assuming that we have sufficient appointments to meet patient demand each week, patients generally cannot obtain an appointment immediately\u2014 particularly because PPH's Iowa patients make two trips to a health center before having abortions, as discussed below. PPH's Iowa health centers are booking more than eleven days out as of June 30, 2023. 30. For patients living in poverty or without insurance, travel-related and financial barriers also help explain why the vast majority of our patients do not\u2014and realistically could 15 Jenna Nobles, Lindsay Cannon, & Allen J.

Logistical delays are often more pronounced for women with two or more children, minors, Black women, and those living in poverty.18In 2021, 12.5% of women in Iowa lived in poverty, and that rate rose to 20.9% among Latina women and 27.8% among Black women in Iowa.19In 2022, 39% of PPH's patients in Iowa had incomes below the federal poverty level. These patients face particularly high barriers to obtaining abortions, including but not limited to raising money for the abortion and associated travel and childcare costs and inability to take time off work. 31. The lack of comprehensive insurance coverage also poses a barrier to Iowans confirming they are pregnant and obtaining abortion coverage when they need it. 8.1% of women in Iowa reported not receiving health care at some point in the last twelve months due to cost.20 Even those patients who have health insurance often do not have access to abortion coverage. With very narrow exceptions, Iowa bars coverage of abortions in its Medicaid program, an important source of health insurance for vulnerable Iowans.21 32. Patients living in poverty and/or without insurance must often make difficult tradeoffs of other basic needs to pay for their abortions, even with assistance from PPH to those patients in need. Many patients must seek financial assistance from extended family and friends to pay for care as well, a process that takes time. Many patients must navigate other logistics, such as inflexible or unpredictable job hours, that may delay the time when they are able to have an 18 Finer et al., supra note 16, at 339. 19 Women in Poverty, State by State 2021 , Nat'l Women's Law Ctr., https://nwlc.org/resource/ women-in-poverty-state-by-state-2022/ (last visited July 10, 2023) (select \"Iowa\" on U.S. map). 20 Iowa, Nat'l Women's Law Ctr., https://nwlc.org/state/iowa/ (last visited July 10, 2023). 21 Iowa Dep't of Human Servs., Certification Regarding Abortion , https://hhs.iowa.gov/sites/ default/files/470-0836.pdf?030320221614 (last revised July abortion-iowa.

In addition to the medical and practical impediments to having abortions\u2014 particularly before six weeks LMP\u2014that I have just described, Iowa has also enacted numerous medically unnecessary statutory and regulatory requirements that must be met before a patient may have an abortion. For example, Iowa requires PPH to ensure that patients have an ultrasound at least twenty-four hours in advance of having an abortion.22PPH must also make available to patients, at least twenty-four hours in advance of an abortion, certain state-mandated information designed to discourage them from having an abortion.23 PPH's Iowa patients therefore make two trips to a health center before they can receive an abortion. Practically speaking, this twenty-four- hour waiting period causes delays in patient care that can last far longer than one day, which may push a patient past the time limit even if they discovered they are pregnant, decided to have an abortion, and scheduled their two appointments prior to six weeks LMP. 34. The impossibility of having an abortion within the time permitted by the Act is all the more clear for our minor patients who are under the age of eighteen. Minor patients without a history of pregnancy may be less likely to recognize early symptoms of pregnancy than older patients who have been pregnant before.24Most of these patients cannot immediately obtain written parental authorization, which means that under Iowa law they cannot have an abortion until forty-eight hours after a parent has been notified or until they have obtained judicial authorization,25which cannot realistically happen before six weeks LMP. 22 Iowa Code \u00a7 146A.1(a)-(c). 23 Iowa Code \u00a7 146A.1(d). 24 Finer et al., supra note 16, at 338. 25 Iowa Code \u00a7 135L.3(3).E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT12 35. Patients whose pregnancies are the result of sexual assault or who are experiencing interpersonal violence may need additional time to access abortion services due to ongoing physical or emotional trauma. According to one large study, 13.8% of women seeking abortions in Iowa reported experiencing physical or sexual abuse within the previous year; 10.8% reported physical or sexual abuse by an intimate partner within that time.26For these patients too, obtaining an abortion before six weeks LMP is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. And as I discuss below, the rape and incest exceptions in the Act will not be accessible to many patients. 36. The impact of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , 142 S.Ct. 228 (2022), has made it even more difficult for patients to access care. Capacity in our health centers continues to be strained by serving patients from states that have limited access to abortion or that have banned abortion altogether. More patients are having to travel for care, and appointment wait times at PPH's Iowa health centers have gone up. 37. For all of these reasons, prior to the Act taking effect, nearly 92% of PPH's Iowa patients in the first half of 2023 did not have an abortion until they had already reached six weeks LMP. The Act's Effects 38. As described above, the earliest a person could reasonably expect to learn that they are pregnant is at four weeks LMP. In my experience, it is common for OB/GYNs not to schedule pregnant patients for their first obstetric visits until well after six weeks LMP.27 Accordingly, an Iowan would have roughly two weeks to detect a pregnancy, decide whether to have an abortion, 26 Audrey F. Saftlas et al., Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Among an Abortion Clinic Population , 100 Am. J. Pub. Health 1412, 1413 (2010). 27 See, e.g. , Our Most Frequently Asked Questions , Central Iowa OBGYN, https://www.centraliowaobgyn.com/faq (last visited July 10, 2023) (Q: \"How soon should I make my first OB appointment?\" A: \"We prefer that you are between 9-10 weeks pregnant.\").

Based on my experience, the vast majority of patients, even those who suspect that they are pregnant at a very early stage, could not realistically take all of these steps before six weeks LMP. The Act's impact will be harshest for our patients with low incomes, patients of color, and patients who live in rural areas who must travel farther distances to reach our health centers. 39. As described above, many other patients do not learn that they are pregnant until after six weeks LMP. Under the Act, these patients could never access abortion in Iowa unless they fall into one of the Act's narrow exceptions, the flaws in which I discuss below. Out-of-State Travel and Related Burdens 40. Under the Act, I anticipate that most Iowans will be forced to seek abortions in other states (if they are able to undertake the necessary travel at all), increasing their burdens and costs. Others will be denied access to abortion care entirely. From Des Moines, for example, the nearest abortion providers outside of Iowa are in Nebraska, around 140 miles away one way, and Nebraska currently only provides abortions up to twelve weeks LMP. While clinics in Kansas provide abortions up to twenty weeks LMP and clinics in Minnesota provide abortions until fetal viability, the nearest clinics in those states are at least 200 miles away one way from Des Moines. 41. The necessary travel caused by the Act will carry with it associated costs, such as lodging, gas, food, time off work, and coverage for any caregiving responsibilities. The logistics required for out-of-state travel may also force some patients to explain the reason for their travel, thus compromising the confidentiality of their decision to have an abortion in order to obtain transportation or childcare. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT14 42. I expect that pregnant people able to have an abortion through another provider in a different state will do so later in pregnancy than they would have had they had access to care in Iowa. Generally speaking, legal barriers to abortion can delay, and in some cases altogether prevent, people from accessing that care.28In addition to the logistical hurdles, the Act will cause clinics in surrounding states to have difficulty absorbing a large influx of patients. PPNCS will not be able to absorb all of our Iowa patients at our clinics in other states, and absorbing those whom we can will push appointment wait times out by days or even weeks. Although abortion is very safe, the physical risks associated with abortion\u2014as is true with pregnancy generally\u2014do increase with gestational age.29Accordingly, even for patients able to travel to another state, the delays created by the Act will still increase those patients' risk of experiencing pregnancy- and abortion- related complications and prolong the period during which they must carry a pregnancy that they have decided to end. Because the cost of abortion services also increases with gestational age,30 delays in access to care caused by the Act may impose additional financial costs on patients related to the abortion service itself. Forced Pregnancy and Parenthood 43. I also expect, as a result of the Act, many patients will be unable to travel out of state to have an abortion in light of the costs and coordination required and will be forced to carry pregnancies to term against their will. 44. Pregnancy affects an individual's health and social circumstances. The effects of pregnancy include a dramatic increase in blood volume, an increased heart rate, increased 28 Jenna Jerman et al., Barriers to Abortion Care and Their Consequences For Patients Traveling for Services: Qualitative Findings from Two States , 49 Persp. on Sexual and Reprod.

As a result of these and other changes, pregnant patients are at a greater risk of blood clots, nausea, hypertensive disorders, and anemia, among other complications. Some of these changes require evaluation and occasionally urgent or emergent care in order to preserve the patient's health or save their life. 45. Many people seek emergency care at least once during a pregnancy, and people with comorbidities (either preexisting or those that develop as a result of their pregnancy), such as asthma, hypertension, or diabetes, are significantly more likely to do so. 46. Pregnancy can also aggravate preexisting health conditions, including hypertension and other cardiac diseases, diabetes, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, obesity, asthma, and other pulmonary diseases. New and serious health conditions can result, including preeclampsia, deep-vein thrombosis, hyperemesis gravidarum, and gestational diabetes. People who develop pregnancy-induced medical conditions are also at higher risk of developing the same condition in subsequent pregnancies. 47. Pregnancy may also induce or exacerbate mental health conditions. A person with a history of mental illness may experience a recurrence or worsening of their illness during pregnancy. These mental health risks can be higher for patients with unintended pregnancies. In Iowa, twenty-eight percent of pregnancies among women of reproductive age were unwanted or mistimed as of 2017.31 For Black and Hispanic/Latina women, the rates of unintended pregnancy are likely to be even higher.32 31 Kathryn Kost et al., Pregnancies and Pregnancy Desires at the State Level: Estimates for 2017 and Trends Since Charvonne N.

Some pregnant patients also face an increased risk of intimate partner violence, and the severity of the risk can escalate during or after pregnancy. Homicides, the majority of which are committed by an intimate partner, are a leading cause of maternal mortality. Compared to women who are able to receive a wanted abortion, women denied wanted abortions are more likely to experience continued intimate partner violence from the man involved in the pregnancy.33 49. Labor and childbirth are significant medical events that are much riskier than legal abortion. The abortion-related mortality rate for legal abortions is only 0.7 deaths per 100,000 abortions, as compared to the national mortality rate among individuals who carry their pregnancies to term, which is 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births.34Patients of color are even more at risk. In 2021, the national maternal mortality rate for Black women was 2.6 times the maternal mortality rate for white women.35 The disparity is even higher in Iowa: Black mothers in Iowa are six times more likely to die than white mothers.36 multiracial women in California in 2009); Lawrence B.

E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT1750. Other complications resulting from labor and childbirth occur at a rate of over 500 per 1,000 delivery hospital stays.37Hemorrhage is the leading cause of severe maternal morbidity. During labor, increased blood flow to the uterus places the patient at risk of hemorrhage and possibly death. Other unexpected adverse events include transfusion, ruptured uterus (the spontaneous tearing of the uterus) or liver, stroke, perineal laceration (the tearing of the tissue around the vagina and rectum), and unexpected hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus). The most severe perineal tears involve tearing between the vagina through the anal sphincter and into the rectum and must be surgically repaired. These can lead to long-term urinary and fecal incontinence and sexual dysfunction. Vaginal delivery can also lead to long-term internal injuries, including injury to the bowel and the pelvic floor, causing urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse. Anesthesia or an epidural administered during labor can create additional risks, including infection, severe headaches, and nerve damage. Patients who become pregnant during their teens or after age thirty-five are more likely to experience complications, placenta previa, and preterm labor. 51. In Iowa, 29.7% of live births in 2021 were the result of a cesarean delivery.38 Because a cesarean delivery is an open abdominal surgery, patients must be hospitalized for at least a few days afterwards and the procedure carries significant risks of hemorrhage, infection, blood clots, and injury to internal organs. Cesarean deliveries also carry long-term risks, including an increased risk of placenta previa in later pregnancies (when the placenta covers the cervix, resulting in vaginal bleeding and requiring bed rest), increased risk of placenta accreta (when the 37 Anne Elixhauser & Lauren M.

Individuals with a history of cesarean delivery are also more likely to need cesarean delivery with subsequent births. 52. Pregnant people with a prior history of mental health conditions also face a heightened risk of postpartum illness, which may go undiagnosed for months or even years. 53. Due to structural barriers that limit access to contraceptives,39people with lower incomes experience disproportionately high rates of unintended pregnancies.40 For people already facing an array of economic hardships, the cost of pregnancy can have especially long-term and severe impacts on their family's financial security. Many of the side effects of pregnancy prevent patients from working the same number of hours that they had prior to pregnancy or working altogether, and patients can lose their jobs as a result. For example, some patients with hyperemesis gravidarum must adjust work schedules because they vomit throughout the day. Patients with preeclampsia must severely limit activity for a significant amount of time. 54. Even in the absence of pregnancy-related side effects, pregnancy-related discrimination can result in lower earnings both during pregnancy and over time.41Iowa does not require private employers to provide paid family leave, meaning that for many pregnant Iowans, 39 ACOG, Comm.

Aside from lost wages, pregnancy-related health care and childbirth are some of the costliest hospital-based health services, particularly for complicated or at-risk pregnancies. Many pregnant patients must pay for significant labor and delivery costs out of pocket, even with insurance coverage. In 2015, of the 98.2% of commercially insured women who had out-of-pocket spending for their labor and delivery, the mean spending for all modes of delivery was $4,569; the mean out-of-pocket spending for that same group of women for vaginal birth, specifically, was $4,314; and for cesarean deliveries, it was $5,161.44 And the average proportion of delivery costs paid by patients has increased over time.45 56. Beyond childbirth, raising a child is expensive, both in terms of direct costs and due to lost wages. On average, women experience a large and persistent decline in earnings following the birth of a child, an economic loss that compounds the additional costs associated with raising a child.46In Iowa, the average cost of infant care is more than $10,000 per year, meaning it would take a minimum wage worker thirty-six weeks working full time to afford 42 Nat'l P'ship for Women & Fams., Paid Leave Means a Stronger Iowa , at 1 (Feb. 2023), available at https://nationalpartnership.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-leave-means- a-stronger- iowa.pdf. 43 Id. 44 Michelle H.

Most abortion patients do not consider adoption an equally acceptable substitute for abortion.48Placing a child for adoption can be very emotionally challenging for patients.49 Adoption can also be expensive, involving medical, legal, and counseling costs. Patients who choose to place their infant for adoption also face physical risks and significant physiological changes associated with full-term pregnancy, labor, and delivery. 58. Women who are denied an abortion are, when compared to those who are able to access abortion, more likely to moderate their future goals and less likely to be able to exit abusive relationships. Their existing children are also more likely to suffer measurable reductions in achievement of child developmental milestones and an increasing chance of living in poverty. Finally, as compared to women who received an abortion, women who are denied abortions are less likely to be employed full-time, more likely to be raising children alone, more likely to receive public assistance, and more likely to not have enough money to meet basic living needs.50Research shows that 95% of women who have abortions continue to believe that it was the right decision 47 Child Care Costs in the United States, The cost of child care in Iowa , Econ.

E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT21 for them three years later.51 Those forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term are at increased risk of preterm birth and failure to bond with a newborn, and are less likely to escape poverty, less likely to be employed, less likely to escape domestic violence, and less likely to formulate and achieve educational, professional, and other life goals. Additionally, when pregnant people lack access to safe, legal abortion, some will attempt to self-induce an abortion, including in ways that can further jeopardize their health or life. Other Harmful Impacts 59. Even where it is possible for patients to have an abortion in compliance with the Act and in light of all the other legal and logistical barriers, the Act will also force patients to race to a health center for an abortion to avoid missing the extremely narrow window when abortion is legally available to them. Although patients who have abortions demonstrate a strong level of certainty with respect to their decision, some patients take longer to make a decision than others. Thus, under the Act, some Iowans would be forced to rush into their decision out of fear that they will lose the opportunity altogether to have an abortion. 60. The Act will force some Iowans who cannot travel out of state for care to seek abortions outside the medical system using pills or other methods that may in some instances be unsafe. 61. The Act also will particularly harm patients who want to end a pregnancy because it is the result of rape or incest, as well as adult or adolescent patients who are at risk of abuse if a pregnancy is discovered. While the Act ostensibly exempts patients who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest, I understand that it does so only if they reported that abuse within an arbitrary period (forty-five days for rape, 140 days for incest), which survivors often do not do because of 51 Corinne H. Rocca et al., Decision Rightness and Emotional Responses to Abortion in the United States: A Longitudinal Study, 10 PLOS ONE 1, 10 (2015). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT22a range of reasons, including out of shame and/or fear of repercussions for themselves or their partners or families.52I also understand that the rape and incest exceptions do not apply if the postfertilization age of the fetus is twenty or more weeks, which corresponds to approximately twenty-two weeks LMP or later.53 62. While the Act refers to situations involving a reported \"rape,\" it does not define that term. My understanding is that Iowa law generally defines \"sexual abuse\" and \"sexual assault\" but not \"rape.\"54Moreover, my and my patients' understanding of what constitutes rape, sexual abuse, and sexual assault might differ from that of law enforcement officials and others, especially in situations involving abuses of authority or in relationships that involve intimate partner violence. Because the Act fails to define the term \"rape\" or rely on a definition of that term elsewhere in Iowa law, the Act does not provide sufficient clarity about when the exception might apply. 63. I am concerned that the Board of Medicine might disagree with a determination I make that a victim has reported rape or incest. I also do not understand what the Act means when it requires victims to report rape or incest to a \"private health agency which may include a family physician,\"55and specifically which physicians would be included in that definition. Finally, I cannot tell from the language of the Act whether I can take a patient at their word when reporting an incident, or whether I am supposed to verify the incident somehow (and if the latter, how I would do that). Again, the Act will jeopardize patient health and safety and provider livelihood by placing providers in danger of losing their license and paying a fee of up to $10,000 if their interpretation of the exemptions is more lenient than the Board of Medicine's. 52 SF 579/HF 732 \u00a7 1(3)(a)-(b). 53 Id. 1(3)(b)-(c). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT2364. In addition, by conditioning the availability of abortion on reporting of rape or incest, the Act will deny needed care to survivors who do not wish to involve law enforcement or who do not wish to discuss the circumstances of their pregnancy as a mandatory condition of obtaining an abortion. In the United States, statistics show that approximately seventy-eight percent of rape and sexual assault cases were not reported to the police in 2021, due to factors including trauma and fear of violent retaliation from the abuser.56 65. The Act's harms will be especially grave for people who need to terminate a pregnancy for health or safety reasons. The Act exempts only those patients with a physical condition that threatens their life or poses a \"serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"57Pregnancy can pose a wide range of severe health problems that are not necessarily encapsulated by this exception. For example, pregnancy may exacerbate diabetes, hypertension, or multiple sclerosis, or cause an autoimmune disorder, such as Crohn's disease, to flare. Diabetic patients with depression or another underlying mental health condition can find their diabetes extremely challenging to manage during pregnancy. Further, pregnant patients with rapidly worsening medical conditions\u2014who, prior to the Act, could have had an abortion without explanation\u2014may be forced to wait for care until a physician determines that their conditions become deadly or threaten substantial and irreversible impairment so as to meet the exception. 66. I also expect that the Act's exclusion of psychological and emotional conditions, including suicidal ideation, from the medical emergency exception will harm our patients.58 Mental health conditions are the leading underlying cause of twenty-three percent of pregnancy- 56 Alexandra Thompson & Susannah N. Tapp, U.S. Dep't of Just., Criminal Victimization, 2021 , at 5 (Sept. 2022), available at https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv21.pdf. 579/HF 732 \u00a7 146A.1(6)(a). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT24related deaths.59 Psychiatric disorders may emerge for the first time during pregnancy, especially among people who have had negative reactions to hormonal contraception in the past or due to psychosocial risk factors, such as youth, poverty, substance use, or a lack of family support. These psychiatric issues can range from worsening anxiety and mood disorders to active suicidal ideation with intentions to self-harm or psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or intrusive thoughts. Someone with a documented history of mental illness whose condition is stable before pregnancy may experience a worsening of mental illness as a result of the hormonal and neurochemical changes to their body and stress and anxiety relating to pregnancy. Moreover, patients regulating a mental health condition with medication that carries risk to the fetus may need to discontinue or modify their medication in order to avoid risking harm to the fetus, but this will significantly increase the likelihood that mental illness recurs. In these situations, the pregnant person faces an increased risk of mental illness both during and after pregnancy because it is more difficult to return to equilibrium after relapse than it is to maintain a stable condition. My understanding is that these patients would not qualify for abortion services under the Act's exception for certain medical conditions. 67. I also am very concerned that I, or another provider, might provide an abortion based on a judgment that this exception applies, only to have that judgment second-guessed by the Board of Medicine. Specifically, the Board might question my medical judgments as to the seriousness of the risk, whether that risk is to a \"major\" bodily function, or whether the potential damage to that function is \"substantial and irreversible.\" Those are all determinations as to which individual professionals might disagree. In making that determination, I would face a conflict between the personal and professional imperative of protecting my patient and the fear that I could 59 Four in 5 pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S. are preventable , CDC (Sept. 19, 2022), https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0919-pregnancy-related-deaths.html. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT25lose my license. It is terrible for patient safety to place providers in that dilemma at a time when they should be focused on providing the best care possible for their patient. 68. For patients who receive a severe fetal anomaly diagnosis, the Act bars physicians from terminating these pregnancies unless they certify that the fetus has a condition that is \"incompatible with life.\"60I understand that even this exception does not apply after twenty weeks postfertilization, or approximately twenty-two weeks LMP.61There is noprenatal testing for fetal anomalies available at six weeks LMP or earlier. Indeed, many anomalies cannot be identified until eighteen to twenty weeks LMP, or even later in pregnancy. 69. The term \"incompatible with life\" is not a medical term. I do not use it in my practice, either in conversations with patients or in their medical records. In order to determine whether pregnancies fall within the scope of that term, I may need to consult with an attorney. To me, it is unconscionable that patients and their families may lose the ability to decide that termination is the most compassionate decision for a fetus that, if it survived to birth, would live a short, incapacitated, painful life. 70. Even for individuals who have a health condition or fetal diagnosis sufficiently severe to clearly fit within the Act's exceptions or who meet the Act's overly narrow rape or incest exceptions, the Act would make it far more difficult, or perhaps impossible, for them to access an abortion\u2014particularly on a timely basis. If the Act went into effect and prevented us from providing abortions in most cases, it is highly unlikely that we could continue to maintain the staffing, medical equipment, and supplies necessary to provide abortion at all the health centers where we currently provide it. As a result, many individuals in these dire circumstances would only have access to care if they were able to travel long distances, potentially out of state. 60 SF 579/HF 732 \u00a7 1(3)(d). 61 Id. \u00a7 2(2)(b).E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT26*** 71. For all of these reasons, I believe that the Act will harm PPH and deprive PPH's patients of access to critical health care and will threaten their health, safety, and lives. 72. This Court's intervention to bar enforcement of the Act and prevent these grave harms is urgently needed: as of July 12, 2023, PPH already has abortions scheduled for 145 patients in Iowa for the weeks of July 10 and July 17, and all of these patients are over six weeks LMP. Therefore, these patients are already grappling with the uncertainty of whether they will be able to receive care, and all of them will be prohibited from having abortions if the Act remains in effect. 73. Leaving the Act in place, even for a matter of days, would also impose additional and substantial logistical, emotional, and financial burdens on patients. As discussed above, particularly because PPH's Iowa patients make two trips to a health center before having abortions, many of our patients must make advance preparations to have abortions, including by finding childcare, asking for time off work and missing out on earnings for that time, and potentially traveling long distances to reach our health centers. It is critically important that PPH be able to assure patients relying on their upcoming appointments that abortion services in Iowa will remain available as planned.

KIM REYNOLDS, ex rel. STATE OF IOWA, and IOWA BOARD OF MEDICINE, Respondents. Case No. _________ AFFIDAVITOFKELLYMARIEZ. MEEK I, KellyMarie Z. Meek, declare and state as follows: 1. I am the Prevention and Public Health Initiatives Coordinator at the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault (\"IowaCASA\"), a statewide organization comprised of twenty- two agencies that provided assistance to 10,928 survivors of sexual violence in Iowa during fiscal year 2022. IowaCASA exists to improve services available for survivors of sexual violence and to support communities to prevent violence before it occurs. 2. I submit this affidavit in support of Petitioner's Emergency Motion for Temporary Injunctive Relief, based on my twenty-six years of personal and professional experience working directly with thousands of survivors of sexual and domestic violence, supporting hundreds of professionals engaged in this work, and based on my education, training, and familiarity with research in this area. 3. I understand that Senate File 579 / House File 732 (the \"Act\") generally bans abortions as soon as a \"fetal heartbeat\" can be detected. I also understand that the Act excepts from this ban terminations of pregnancies that are the result of a rape or incest that has been reported \"to a law enforcement agency or to a public or private health agency which may E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT2include a family physician,\" within forty-five days of the incident in the case of rape or within 140 days in the case of incest. SF 579/HF 732, \u00a7 1(3)(a). 4. My curriculum vitae is attached as Exhibit A. 5. I began working at IowaCASA in 2008, and I have served the agency in a variety of roles, including training and supporting professionals who work directly with survivors, expanding survivors' access to Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners, and coordinating state and community sexual violence prevention efforts. 6. Prior to this position, I spent ten years, initially as a volunteer and later as a staff member, working at a local domestic violence and sexual assault program in eastern Iowa. I provided emergency and long-term advocacy, training on hospital and police response, sheltering services, hotline response, and legal advocacy for survivors of sexual assault, rape, incest, child abuse, and stalking. During my time with that program, I supported survivors who were pregnant as a result of the sexual and domestic violence that they experienced. Many of those survivors chose to parent, many chose adoption, and many chose abortion. As an advocate, I supported them in all of those decisions. 7. Based on my extensive experience, it is my opinion that the Act will be devastating to survivors who become pregnant as a result of abuse, despite its exceptions. Access to Abortion Is Essential to Survivors of Assault Who May Become Pregnant 8. Each year, thousands of Iowans are victims of violence that may result in pregnancy.1 Survivors desperately need accessible health care, including abortion. 1Jingzhen Yang et al., Costs of Sexual Violence in Iowa (2009): Final Report to the Department of Public Health , at 1 (2012), available at https://iprc.public-health.uiowa.edu/wp- content/uploads/2016/03/Cost-Sexual-Violence-Iowa-FINAL-1.pdf (\"In 2009, an estimated 23,709 adults in Iowa were raped.\"). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT39. Survivors of abuse are at heightened risk of unwanted pregnancy, either because their abusers do not care about helping to prevent pregnancy or because they are actively trying to cause pregnancy to keep their victims connected to them so they can continue to harm.2Survivors' access to contraception is often blocked by fear and violence or threat of violence, as well as by factors such as age, disability, cost, and stigma.3 10. Because of the association between abuse and unintended pregnancy, a significant portion of individuals seeking an abortion are currently being abused or are at risk for abuse. In one large-scale study of patients seeking abortion services in Iowa, 13.8% reported having experienced physical or sexual abuse in the previous year, and 10.8% reported intimate partner violence (meaning abuse specifically perpetrated by a romantic partner) in the previous year.4Notably, this study did not measure patients experiencing emotional abuse, though coercion and threats can and do lead to unwanted sexual contact and pregnancy. It also did not measure patients who were at increased risk of experiencing physical or sexual abuse, the experiences of adult survivors of child sexual abuse, or patients who had experienced violence longer than one year ago\u2014all of which impact survivors' experiences of reproductive health care and pregnancy. 11. IowaCASA commonly sees situations in which an abusive partner uses pregnancy as a means of controlling a victim. For example, survivors of intimate partner violence or 2See Leah S. Sharman, et al., Associations Between Unintended Pregnancy, Domestic Violence, and Sexual Assault in a Population of Queensland Women , 26 Psychiat., Psychol. and Law Ajayi & Henrietta Chinelo Ezegbe, Association Between Sexual Violence and Unintended Pregnancy Among Adolescent Girls and Young Women in South Africa, 20 BMC Public Health 1370 (2020). 3Lauren Maxwell et al., Estimating the Effect of Intimate Partner Violence on Women's Use of Contraception: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis , 10 PLoS 1 (2015). 4Audrey F. Saftlas et al., Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Among an Abortion Clinic Population , 100 Am. J. Pub. Health 1412, 1413 (2010). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT4sexual abuse often report that their partner denies them access to birth control (e.g., by denying them the money or insurance information they would need to obtain contraception) or sabotages their birth control (e.g., by throwing away pills or forcibly removing intrauterine devices (IUDs)). Some abusers do so because they know that pregnancy, childbearing, and parenting will be physically taxing and will create financial, emotional, and practical dependencies\u2014as well as legal ties\u2014that will make it harder or impossible for the victim to leave them. Research indicates that between 8% and 31% of women have experienced reproductive coercion.5 12. On the other hand, we see victims and survivors who are desperate to terminate their pregnancy so that they, and any children they already have, can escape and gain independence from their abuser. Indeed, research indicates that victims who manage to terminate their pregnancy are more likely to escape (and less likely to suffer continuing physical violence) than victims who seek to terminate their pregnancy but are unable to do so.6I have seen this in my work as well. I have seen victims and survivors who were forced to stay with their abusers because they were raising small children and could not do so without the abuser's financial assistance, and I have seen survivors for whom ending their pregnancy allowed them (and their children) to escape and become independent from their abuser. 13. We also see victims who are desperate to terminate a pregnancy because of the traumatic circumstances, such as rape, in which that pregnancy is occurring or because they are still 5Laura Tarzia & Kelsey Hegarty, A Conceptual Re-evaluation of Centring Intent, Control , 18 Reprod. Health 87 (2021). 6Sarah C.M. Roberts, et al., Risk of Violence From the Man Involved in the Pregnancy After Receiving or Being Denied an Abortion , 12 BMC Med 1 (2014). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT5healing from past experiences of violence. The physical aspects of pregnancy, including the sense of losing control of one's body, can be particularly traumatic to survivors who are otherwise not in control of their bodies or lives. I have seen situations where such pregnancies trigger flashbacks, dissociative episodes, and other symptoms of re- traumatization, and survivors have described being forced to continue with a pregnancy as an additional assault. I have talked to survivors as recently as last week who are not currently pregnant but who are experiencing sexual assault trauma triggers from discussions about limiting access to abortion services, as it feels like yet another violation on their bodily autonomy and right to make their own decisions. 14. Many victims of abuse or sexual assault have health reasons for seeking an abortion. There is a strong association between intimate partner violence, incest, and mental health challenges such as complex PTSD, and survivors may feel they are not healthy enough to survive pregnancy or parent a child.7 I have seen victims seek an abortion because they were taking psychiatric medications that would be dangerous to a pregnancy. The Act will place these victims at particular risk because it could force them to discontinue medications that are critical to their health, safety, and wellbeing. 15. It is already hard for victims of sexual assault or incest to access abortion care. In particular, it can be difficult if not impossible for victims to escape their abuser's physical, emotional, and financial control long enough to access an abortion\u2014often secretly. In cases where they have been physically isolated from the community, they 7SeeArielle A.J. Scoglio et al., Intimate Partner Violence, Mental Health Symptoms, and Modifiable Health Factors in Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US , 6 JAMA Netw.

(Oct. 6, 2022), https://www.who.int/news/item/06-10-2022-preventing-intimate-partner-violence- improves-mental-health. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT6may not be able to leave their homes to seek routine medical care in the hours or days directly following the assault, let alone have access to transportation and the financial means to access other follow-up services, including abortion. Survivors of abuse may also have to hide their situations from family or household members in order to preserve their own safety. 16. Even when survivors are able to access reproductive care, there are many reasons that care can be substantially delayed. For example, one of the survivors I worked with who was raped by her partner was unable to access emergency contraception during the time period when it would have been most effectivebecause he worked only intermittently, and she had to wait for him to leave the house before she could travel to a hospital or pharmacy without his knowledge. 17. These are some of the reasons why access to abortion is critical for the many Iowans each year who face an unwanted pregnancy while also struggling with past abuse or assault or ongoing intimate partner violence. The Act's Exceptions Will Not Protect Victims 18. As I noted at the outset, the Act excepts certain victims of rape or incest from its general prohibition on abortion. However, many of the survivors we work with would not fall under this narrow and burdensome exception. 19. The definition of \"incest\" in the Iowa Code only includes sex between blood relatives.8 Thus, it is unclear whether the Act's incest exceptions would protect adolescents who became pregnant from incest perpetrated by a stepparent or stepsibling, which is by far the most common form of incest seen in my work across the state. 8Iowa Code \u00a7 726.2. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT720. Similarly, the Act excepts situations involving a reported \"rape,\" but does not define that term. \"Rape\" is not a term defined under Iowa law. Although a survivor could report instances of various types and degrees of \"sexual abuse\" to law enforcement,9 they could not report an incident that would be classified as \"rape\" under criminal law because no such classification exists. 21. Moreover, individuals disagree about what constitutes rape or sexual abuse. For example, in situations involving intimate partner violence, an abusive partner might set expectations of sex after resolution of a violent episode or create a general level of fear in which the victim might be subjected to sex that they did not want but were not in a position to resist. Or a student who was intoxicated and cannot remember what happened to them the night before might not even realize that they were assaulted\u2014or if they did, they may blame themselves for drinking instead of holding the person who committed the assault responsible. My colleagues and I would certainly consider such acts to be rape, but in my experience law enforcement officials and others could well disagree. I would anticipate similar disagreement over incidents in which an authority figure, such as a counselor, exploits that position to obtain sex from someone in a vulnerable state and/or position. Thus, the Act does not provide guidance to abortion providers as to when they can provide an abortion under the rape exception, nor does it clearly cover all situations where someone may face an unwanted pregnancy that is the result of unwanted or coerced sex. 22. Most victims of incest do not report the abuse for many different reasons: because they fear their abuser may harm them physically, because they feel guilty or ashamed about 9Iowa Code \u00a7 709.1. E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT8the abuse, because they fear they will not be believed, or because they are afraid to break up their family.10 23. Rape is also underreported for similar reasons, particularly in situations where the perpetrator is a spouse or partner.11In my experience, avictim may fear retaliation, may fear loss of that partner's love or support, or may fear repercussions for their family. They may feel partly responsible for the rape; that is a common dynamic in an abusive relationship. Or the victim may be so far under their partner's psychological control that they have not yet processed that a traumatic and/or violent event was rape. 24. For victims of rape or incest, another barrier to reporting is that reporting, and describing, abuse can itself be re-traumatizing because it takes them back mentally to the time of the abuse. Victims of abuse often actively avoid situations, such as reporting, that will have this effect because they know and fear how painful that experience will be. I have seen this again and again in my work. Many victims delay reporting or avoid it altogether to avoid re-traumatization. Under the Act, they will find themselves unable to access an abortion, however traumatic or disastrous it will be for them to continue their pregnancy. This is especially so given the very short and arbitrary restriction on the time\u2014forty-five days\u2014within which a rape must be reported to qualify for an exception under the Act. 25. Moreover, a victim often may not know whether a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or a consensual relationship, as it is not uncommon for a survivor to have ongoing 10 Maria Sauzier, Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: For Better or For Worse , 12 Psychiatr. Clinics of N. Am. 455, 460-61 (1989); Tina B. Goodman-Brown et al., Why Children Tell: A Model of Children's Disclosure of Sexual Abuse , 27 Child Abuse & Neglect 525, 535-37 (2003). 11 Alexandra Thompson & Susannah N. Tapp, U.S. Dep't of Just., Criminal Victimization, 2021 , at 5 (Sept. 2022), available at https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv21.pdf (finding that approximately 78% of rape and sexual assault cases were not reported to the police in 2021). E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT9consensual sexual activity with a partner and be raped in the same time period. This means that they are unsure whether a pregnancy is the result of consensual sex or rape until genetic testing could be done, at which point it would be too late to obtain an abortion. If the patient does not know, it appears to me that the physician cannot apply the Act's exception. 26. I also anticipate that the Act's exceptions will be particularly hard for undocumented immigrants and their families to access. These individuals reasonably fear that if they contact any law enforcement officials, they or their families might be placed in detention and removal proceedings. Many of them are unaware of programs such as the U visa, which provide protection to some survivors in some cases. Even if they are aware, the years-long processing time12for U visas may deter or overwhelm survivors. I know from my work that fear of detention or removal proceedings is widespread in Iowa, and it is a huge barrier to victims' reporting abuse. 27. For all of these reasons, I believe that the Act will cause great harm to Iowans. 12 U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Citizenship & Immigr.

The bill provides definitions of terms used in the 22 Code chapter, including those for \"fetal heartbeat exception\", 23 \"medical emergency\", \"reasonable medical judgment\", and \"unborn child\". For the purposes of Code chapter 146E, unless 25 otherwise provided, \"medical emergency\" means a situation 26 in which an abortion is performed to preserve the life of 27 the pregnant woman whose life is endangered by a physical 28 disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a 29 life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from 30 the pregnancy, but not including psychological conditions, 31 emotional conditions, familial conditions, or the woman's age; 32 or when continuation of the pregnancy will create a serious 33 risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major 34 bodily function of the pregnant woman. 35 -3- LSB 2572HV (1) 90 pf/rh 3/ 5 E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURTH.F. 732 The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical 1 emergency or fetal heartbeat exception, a physician shall not 2 perform an abortion unless the physician has first complied 3 with the prerequisites of Code chapter 146A (prerequisites 4 for abortion \u2014\u2014 licensee discipline) and has tested the 5 pregnant woman to determine if a fetal heartbeat is detectable. 6 The bill prescribes the standards for testing for a fetal 7 heartbeat, and provides that, following the test, a physician 8 shall inform the pregnant woman, in writing, whether a fetal 9 heartbeat was detected and that if a fetal heartbeat was 10 detected, an abortion is prohibited. Upon receipt of the 11 written information, the pregnant woman is required to sign a 12 form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has received the 13 required information. A physician shall retain documentation 14 of the testing for a fetal heartbeat, the results of the test, 15 and the pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the 16 pregnant woman received the required information. 17 A physician is prohibited from performing an abortion upon 18 a pregnant woman when it has been determined that a fetal 19 heartbeat was detected, unless a medical emergency or fetal 20 heartbeat exception exists. However, notwithstanding the 21 prohibition relating to the detection of a fetal heartbeat 22 and the medical emergency and fetal heartbeat exceptions 23 under Code chapter 146E, if the physician determines that the 24 probable postfertilization age, as defined in Code chapter 25 146B, of the unborn child is 20 or more weeks, the physician 26 shall not perform an abortion on the pregnant woman when it 27 has been determined that the unborn child has a detectable 28 fetal heartbeat unless, in the physician's reasonable medical 29 judgment, the pregnant woman has a condition which the 30 physician deems a medical emergency as defined in Code section 31 146B.1 (\"medical emergency\" means a situation in which an 32 abortion is performed to preserve the life of the pregnant 33 woman whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical 34 illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering 35 -4- LSB 2572HV (1) 90 pf/rh 4/ 5 E-FILED 2023 JUL 12 9:37 AM POLK - CLERK OF DISTRICT COURTH.F. 732 physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy, or 1 when continuation of the pregnancy will create a serious risk 2 of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily 3 function of the pregnant woman) or the abortion is necessary to 4 preserve the life of an unborn child. 5 The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal 6 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in 7 violation of the division.

Kim Reynolds released the following statement in response to the Iowa Legislature passing the heartbeat bill: \"Today, the Iowa legislature once again voted to protect life and end abortion at a heartbeat, with exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.\" \"The Iowa Supreme Court questioned whether this legislature would pass the same law they did in 2018, and today they have a clear answer. The voices of Iowans and their democratically elected representatives cannot be ignored any longer, and justice for the unborn should not be delayed.\" \"As a pro-life Governor, I am also committed to continuing policies to support women in planning for motherhood, promote the importance of fatherhood, and encourage strong families. Our state and country will be stronger because of it.\" Gov. Reynolds plans to sign the bill on Friday, July 14, 2023.G o v .
