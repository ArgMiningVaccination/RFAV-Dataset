Introduction The 'Guide to Ethnobotanical Plants and Herbs, Synthetic Chemicals, Compounds and Products' available to the Irish Market has been collated and designed by the Drug Education Officer and team in the Substance Misuse Service HSE, South Tipperary. This edition is a follow on to 'A Guide to Substance Misuse for Medical Professionals' launched in November 2009. This Guide has been produced in response to requests from workers, users, medical professionals and academics for information on the emerging issue of legal herbal highs, plants and chemical alternatives available to buy in shops and online. Legal highs, legal alternatives and natural highs have become a world wide phenomenon in recent years both here in Ireland and on the International stage. The current concern for users, parents and professionals working with people using and misusing Psychoactive Substances is their after effects and how they can negatively impact on the body and mind. A Psychoactive Substance is a drug (any substance that changes the way a body and mind feels acts or thinks) that is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977-84 and is therefore legal to use and possess. Legal and high together can be misleading because the majority of the substances are regulated under the Medicines Act which makes it illegal to sell, supply or advertise them for human consumption. Hence the advertisement on some products sold legally sates not for human consumption- plant feeder. Many suppliers and manufacturers also sell products as \"bath salts\" or \"incense\" . This is a way of sellers getting around drugs laws. Psychoactive Substances are sold with some ingredients not listed, no ingredients listed at all or ingredients with any information available. The high level of danger these substances have and may cause to human health is causing concern across the country. The ingredients in products sold come from three main sources: Ethno-botanical psychoactive plants and herbs Chemicals - mainly used for research purposes Compounds- which are gelling agents used to bind the products The Psychoactive plants used in legal high products are mainly benign in their own right but when certain alkaloids and extracts are procured they will provide one of four classifications of psychactivity: Stimulant Hallucinogenic Depressant Aphrodisiac Other ingredients included in products such as chemical based compounds are designed in the main to research specific elements of drug use JWH-018 is an example of this. These chemicals are cannabimimetic compounds or synthetic cannabinoids which were developed originally as potential painkilling drugs, yet are included in many Spice and smoke products. The purpose of this publish is to dispel some myths and to provide as accurate information as possible to date of this publication going to print. The aim of the guide is to facilitate detailed information on Psychoactive Substances and alternatives in Ireland. The objective of the guide is to provide an easy access quick reference, To include relevant up to date Psychoactive Substances facts and information. To provide the legal status and scheduling of all legal highs available in Ireland in shops and on line. We would like to thank and acknowledge those who reviewed the Guide at different stages of its inception; they include Dr. Des Corrigan, NACD and Brian Roberts - Garda Narcotics Unit. Disclaimer: The Substance Misuse Service HSE South Tipperary has endeavoured to ensure that all information contained within the Guide is accurate at the time of publishing. However the Guide is detailing with substances that have no strict controls and ingredients are subject to change.6 Drug LawsPsychoactive Substances Drug Laws The introduction The availability of drugs in Ireland is legally controlled through a number of statutes. This chapter will give you an overview of the key statutes and their provisions. The 1947 Health Act The 1947 Health Act permits the Minister for Health to make regulations to control the sale of medical preparations. Several such regulations exist. The Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations restrict the sale of a wide range of drugs to pharmacists only. The regulations are comprised of fi ve schedules. Drugs listed in either part of the fi rst schedule may only be made available by retail sale on medical, dental or veterinary prescription. This schedule includes amphetamine-type stimulants and barbiturate sedatives, as well as various minor tranquillizers of the diazepam type, all of which are also subjected to other far more stringent controls. The second schedule lists substances such as oral contraceptives. The third schedule includes medicines that a pharmacist may not supply under the 'emergency supply' regulations for example barbiturates, which are controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act. The fourth schedule lists cautionary warning notices that should appear on dispensed medicines. For example, various anti-histamine drugs used to combat hay fever, prevent travel sickness and included in some cough bottles may cause drowsiness. Accordingly, the latter type of product must bear a warning that' this may cause drowsiness: The fi fth schedule contains substances which cannot be supplied by a pharmacist in an emergency at a patient's request but which may be supplied at the request of a G.P . The 1961 Poisons Act The 1961 Poisons Act controls the sale of poisons by confi rming their sale to authorized sellers, which are mainly pharmacists. Most recognized drugs of misuse are controlled in this way, but are also subject to further more stringent legal controls. Medical Preparations (Control of Amphetamines) Regulations 1970 The Medical Preparations (Control of Amphetamines) Regulations 1970 prohibit the manufacture, preparation, importation, sale or distribution of seven scheduled amphetamine ('speed') type drugs. The Minister for Health may grant licenses for the manufacture, importation or sale of a specifi ed quantity of controlled preparation when it is needed for certain medical conditions. Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 & 1984. The Misuse of Drugs Acts is intended to prevent the non-medical use of drugs. For this reason, they control not just medicinal drugs but also drugs with no current medical use. Off ences involving the general public are covered under these Acts. The drugs to which the Acts apply are specifi ed in the schedules to the Act and are known as controlled drugs. The list includes, in addition to opiates such as heroin, other substances such as sedatives, stimulants and hallucinogenic drugs which are liable to misuse. 7 Drug LawsSection 1 - Drug Laws The Acts defi ne a series of off ences relating to controlled drugs including \u2014 unlawful supply intent to supply the import or export the unlawful production the growing of opium poppies, cannabis and coca plants the forging of prescriptions the occupiers of premises knowingly allowing illicit tra c in drugs The occupiers of premises permitting the use of controlled drugs on their premises. The Acts also prohibit the unlawful possession of drugs, but make a distinction between possession for one's own personal use and possession for illegal supply to another person ('pushing'). This latter off ence carries much heavier penalties. It should be noted that the phrase used in Section 15 is \"Sale or Supply' which can mean in eff ect sharing drugs with colleagues or friends. In other words the common perception is that to be guilty of pushing drugs, money has to change hands. This is not true from a legal point of view. To enforce this law, the Gardai have special search powers to stop, detain, and search people and vehicles without a warrant if they have 'reasonable cause' to believe that someone is in possession of a controlled drug. Customs and Excise offi cers have similar powers under the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) to request searches by a medical practitioner acting at the request of a Customs Offi cer, in order to detect smuggling of drugs in body cavities so-called 'stuff ers and swalIowers. The Misuse of Drugs Act 1984 prohibits the printing, or sale of books or magazines that encourage the use of drugs proscribed in the Act or which contain advertisements for drug equipment, pipes or cocaine kits. Maximum sentences diff er according to the nature of the off ence. Sentences are greater for pushing, illegal production or for allowing premises to be used for producing or supplying drugs, but are less for possession for one's own use. For the more serious off ences, maximum penalties include life imprisonment or an open-ended fi ne. In the case of cannabis, on the other hand, the maximum penalty for possession for personal use is restricted to a \u20ac381 fi ne for a fi rst off ence tried in the District Court a \u20ac635 fi ne on indictment, \u20ac508 fi ne for a second off ence with no option of imprisonment. If this second off ence is tried before a judge and jury, the maximum fi ne is \u20ac1,270 or 12 months in jail or both. The penalty for a third off ence tried by judge and jury is an open-ended fi ne or three years in jail, or both. It's only the possession of cannabis and marijuana that attracts a money fi ne for possession. The possession of any other illegal drug e.g. Cocaine, Ecstasy, and Heroin, can carry a custodial sentence, even on a fi rst off ence. The penalty for possession of all other drugs depends on the type of court. In the District Court penalty is a maximum fi ne of\u20ac1, 270 or 12 months in jail, or both. In the case of a person found guilty before a judge and jury, the maximum fi ne for possession is left to the discretion the court. In the recent past the law has introduced a mandatory 10-year prison sentence for possession of any 'illegal drug' valued at more than \u20ac1 0,000. There is a provision in the law that if the quantity of drugs found in your possession is currently not for immediate use, you are deemed to be dealing in those drugs. When a person is convicted of an off ence under these Acts the Court may decide to obtain a written medical report on the convicted person, with recommendations about medical treatment which the person might require arising from his or her dependency on drugs, and also a report on the person's social background, vocational and educational circumstances. On the basis of these reports the Court may decide not to impose stipulated penalty. 8 Drug LawsPsychoactive Substances It can decide to have the person detained in a custodial treatment centre require them to undergo a course of medical treatment a course of education and training, or both, to improve their social and educational background with a view to facilitating social rehabilitation. This concept has rarely been implemented. A refi nement was introduced on a pilot basis in 2001 with the introduction of a Drugs Court system under the aegis of the District Court. The idea is that these Courts would be treatment focused and that problem drug users charged with non-violent off ences could be diverted to treatment programmes rather than being sent to jail. Regulations made under the Misuse of Drugs Acts divide the controlled drugs into fi ve separate schedules to take account of medical practice. These schedules allow exceptions to the general prohibitions on the possession supply and use of controlled drugs. Schedule 1. Schedule 1 lists mainly hallucinogenic drugs that have no medical use at present. It also includes some of the 'designer' drugs' . The drugs in this schedule cannot be prescribed by doctors or sold in pharmacies. The use of these drugs is limited to scientifi c research or forensic analysis. Production, supply, import and possession are subject to special licensing. Schedule 2. Schedule 2 lists those drugs which may be used for medical purposes but which are regarded as particularly dangerous if misused. The list consists mainly of the opiates, both naturally occurring ones such as morphine and synthetic ones such as pethidine. It also includes amphetamines and related stimulants. Any of these drugs can only be legally obtained when prescribed by a doctor, dentist or veterinary surgeon and supplied by a pharmacist. All aspects of the production and supply of Schedule 2 drugs are strictly controlled and licensed. These drugs are further subject to stringent storage conditions in pharmacies and to strict record keeping requirements.Schedule 3. Schedule 3 lists drugs to which less stringent controls and no record keeping requirements apply. It contains certain dependence-producing sedatives such as barbiturates, some painkillers and some appetite suppressants. Schedule 4.Schedule 4 lists various minor tranquillizers and preparations of phenobarbitone containing less than 100 milligrams. There are minimal misuse of drugs controls applied, since these medicines are already controlled under the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations made under the 1947 Health Act. Schedule 5. Schedule 5 lists certain preparations of controlled drugs to which the restrictions on possession do not apply. These are usually very dilute non-injectable products some of which can be bought over the counter (OTC) without a prescription only from a pharmacy, for example some cough bottles and anti-diarrhoea products that contain opiates. The Acts give the Minister for Health the power to give a direction prohibiting the prescribing of controlled drugs by a doctor, dentist or veterinary surgeon, who has been found, after investigation by a committee of inquiry, to have been prescribing, administering or supplying such drugs in an irresponsible manner. A doctor, dentist or veterinary surgeon against whom such a direction is made is given an opportunity to answer the case made against him/her and also has the right of appeal to the Courts. The Minister for Health has served seven doctors with such directions, since 1979 when the Misuse of Drugs Act became law. There is a special procedure allowing the Minister to give temporary direction in a case of urgency. A prohibition on prescribing under such a direction lasts for four weeks but may be extended for periods of 28 days at a time while a committee of inquiry investigates the case. 9 Drug LawsSection 1 - Drug Laws International and E.U. regulations. The processing of drugs from plants such as the Opium poppy and Coca plant as well as the synthesis of L.S.D., Ecstasy, Amphetamines and the so-called 'designer drugs' requires the availability of various chemicals needed in diff erent stages of their production. Article 12 of the 1988 United Nations Convention against the lllicit Traffi c in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances attempts to limit the supply of precursor and processing chemicals to illegal drugs producers. Within the E.U., a number of Council Regulations and a Directive (92/109/EEC) have been introduced to give force to the provisions of the U.N. Convention. In Ireland, the E.U. provisions have been implemented by means of the European Communities (Monitoring of External Trade in Scheduled Substances) Regulations 1993. The controls in the Regulations require producers, importers, distributors and users of 22 diff erent chemicals to maintain records of stock. Government authorization is required before some chemicals can be exported, while for others, such authorization is only required if they are being exported to certain key countries such as Colombia, Lebanon and Myanmar (Burma). Advance notifi cation of sales of chemicals such as Ergotamine used to produce L.S.D. or Safrole used to produce Ecstasy, allow governments an opportunity to delay consignments pending investigation or to veto deliveries altogether. A person who commits an off ence under these Regulations may be fi ned up to \u20ac1,270 or imprisoned for up to 1 year or may be fi ned and imprisoned. The Government has further strengthened the controls on these 22 precursor chemicals by designating them as controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. Criminal Justice Act 1994 The Criminal Justice Act of 1994 made provision for the recovery of the proceeds of drug traffi cking by making it possible for the Director of Public Prosecutions to ask a court which has found a defendant guilty of such a charge, to determine whether the person has benefi ted from drug traffi cking. If the court so determines, a confi scation order shall be made to recover the amount of money determined by the court. The Act defi nes drug traffi cking off ences as including those under the Misuse of Drug Act 1977 (sections 5,15 and 20), off ences under the Customs Acts as well as planning of the production, supply, transportation, storage, import or export of a controlled drug both inside the State and elsewhere. The Act requires that a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment be imposed on individuals found guilty of an off ence under Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act where the off ence is considered to be drug dealing and the value of the drug or drugs amount to \u20ac12,700 or more. In the case of individuals who are addicted to drugs and where their addiction is a substantial factor in their drug dealing, the sentence may be reviewed after fi ve years. This Act also created the off ence of money laundering which involves concealing or disguising property representing the proceeds of drug traffi cking, transferring or removing it from the State. Individuals who help drug traffi ckers and other criminals to launder money likewise come within the scope of this Act. Once found guilty, they may be fi ned \u20ac1,270 or sent to jail for 12 months (District Court). If tried in a higher court they are liable to penalties of a fi ne, 14 years in jail or both. Designated bodies such as fi nancial institutions and their staff must establish the identity of those seeking to use their services, particularly where it involves sums of at least \u20ac12,700 and must report to the Gardai where they suspect that a money laundering off ence is involved. The Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 The Government established the Criminal Assets Bureau after the enactment of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996.The Criminal Assets Bureau identifi es assets derived directly or indirectly from criminal activity and aims to deprive individuals of these 10 Drug LawsPsychoactive Substances assets by means of confi scation, restraint of use, freezing, preservation or seizure of all assets identifi ed as deriving or suspected to derive from such activity. In addition, the Bureau aims to ensure that such individuals and their assets are subjected to the full rigors of the Revenue Acts including taxation. The profi ts arising from drug dealing as defi ned in the Misuse of Drugs Acts are a major target for the Criminal Assets Bureau. The Bureau consists of members of the Garda Siochana, Revenue Commissioners and of the Department of Social and Family Aff airs, nominated by the respective organisations as well as legal and technical experts. Their identities cannot be revealed so as to protect them and their families from threats and intimidation. Any such attempt is punishable by means of a fi ne of \u20ac1,905 or 12 months in jail imposed by the District Court. Higher courts may impose fi nes of \u20ac127,000 or 10 years imprisonment or both. The Criminal Justice (Drug Tra cking) Act 1996 The Criminal Justice (Drug Traffi cking) Act 1996 gives Gardai additional powers of detention where they suspect someone is involved in drug traffi cking or where they are suspected of concealing drugs within their body. Under the provision of the Act a person can be detained for up to 1 week (168 hours) initially upon the authority of a Chief Superintendent but subsequently by way of a warrant from a District or Circuit Court judge. The aim is to provide time for the Gardai to fully investigate any alleged traffi cking off ences. The Act further allows courts to draw inferences from the failure of an individual to mention facts to be relied on in their defence, either before or when being charged. It also gives Gardai power to enter and search dance halls. Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act 1997 The power to enter dance halls was extended further by the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act 1997 which made provision for measures to combat drug misuse in places used for public dancing in licensed premises and other entertainment venues. It also provided the Gardai with the power to prevent unlicensed dances such as open-air' raves' In the case of a 'rave' individuals involved in organising it can be directed to leave an area and remove any sound or lighting equipment. Failure to comply leads to a fi ne of up to \u20ac1,905 or 3 months imprisonment. The Gardai can also stop and turn back individuals planning to attend such an unlicensed dance. Gardai can seize sound equipment they suspect is to be used at an unlicensed dance and a court may order the confi scation of the sound equipment subsequently. In relation to pub and dance hall licenses, any person who has been convicted of a drug traffi cking off ence is disqualifi ed from ever holding such a license. A license holder who permits the use of the licensed premises for the sale, supply or distribution of a controlled drug is likely to have the license immediately revoked by Court Order and neither they nor the premises may obtain a license for fi ve years. The license-holder must have been previously warned by a member of the Gardai Siochana about the suspicion that the premises was being used for traffi cking in drugs and the need to prevent such activity and have been given not less than 4 weeks to take appropriate action. Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 allows housing authorities or their tenants to apply to the District Court for an excluding order against an individual engaged in anti-social behaviour. Such behaviour is defi ned as drug dealing and / or serious violence and intimidation. It should be noted that simple possession of drugs for personal use does not come under this heading. In such circumstances the District Court may order an individual to leave the house in question and not to enter or be in the vicinity of the house or housing estate. Such excluding orders may be made on an interim basis and allow a more targeted approach that permits the eviction of an entire household in cases of anti-social behaviour. Orders may be made for a maximum period of three years 11 Drug LawsSection 1 - Drug Laws but can be renewed or varied in length. Individuals who disobey the order may be fi ned a maximum of\u20ac1, 905 or sentenced to 12 months in jail or to both a fi ne and jail by the Court. The Act also permits the housing authority to refuse to let or sell a dwelling to a person where the authority considers that the person is engaged in anti-social behaviour or that the letting would not be in the interest of good estate management. Health Boards may also refuse or withdraw rent and mortgage assistance to individuals who have been evicted, excluded or refused housing on grounds of antisocial behaviour. Non Fatal O ences against the Person Act 1992 The Non Fatal Off ences against the Person Act 1992 made it an off ence to attack someone with a syringe or to threaten them with a syringe. On conviction, the District Court may impose a fi ne of \u20ac1,905 or 12 months imprisonment or both. In higher courts someone found guilty may be fi ned or sentenced up to 10 years in jail. This Act also permits Gardai to seize syringes and penalise individuals who abandon syringes where others are likely to be endangered. In these cases the District Court penalties are the same as for attacks but on indictment the maximum jail sentence is 7 years. Section 12 of this Act involves poisoning off ences of relevance to 'spiking' of drinks as well as to cases of drug-assisted sexual assault so-called 'date rape' . Poisoning is interpreted as knowingly administering a substance to another person without their consent, which is capable of interfering substantially with the person's bodily functions. Such a substance may be one that is capable of causing unconsciousness or sleep. The penalty for someone found guilty in the District Court is a fi ne of \u20ac1,905 or 12 months or both. On indictment such as in the Circuit Court there may be a fi ne or 3 years in jail or both fi ne and jail sentence. Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 makes it an off ence for a person to be intoxicated in a public place to such an extent as to be a danger to themselves or others. The penalty for such an off ence is a fi ne of not more that \u20ac508. While the word 'intoxicated' mainly relates to drunkenness, the Act makes clear that it also refers to other drugs, to solvents or other substances or to combinations of substances. The Act also allows Gardai to seize any bottle or container that they have reasonable cause to suspect contains an intoxicating substance, They can also indicate, in relation to certain events, that those in possession of intoxicating liquor are liable to have that alcohol confi scated. Road Tra c (Amendment) Act 1987 The Road Traffi c (Amendment) Act 1987 makes it an off ence to drive a car, motor bike, truck, pedal cycle or animal drawn vehicle while 'under the infl uence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having control of the vehicle' . Intoxicants include alcohol and drugs and any combination of drugs and alcohol. The word 'drugs' here includes prescribed and over the counter (OTC) medicines. Merchant Shipping Act 1992 The Merchant Shipping Act 1992 (Section 24 Subsection 2) makes it an off ence for the master or a crew member of a ship to be under the infl uence of alcohol or any other drug while on duty, to such an extent that his ability to discharge his duties is impaired. The penalty is a maximum fi ne of \u20ac1,270. Intoxicating Liquor Acts 1988 & 2000 The supply, possession and consumption of alcohol and tobacco by adults are permitted, but at the same time availability is aff ected by taxation and various laws, some of which are designed to discourage young people from drinking and smoking. The Intoxicating 12 Drug LawsPsychoactive Substances Liquor Act 1988 not only prohibits the sale of alcohol to those under 18, but also makes it an off ence for a person under 18 to buy alcohol or to drink alcohol in a public place. In an amendment to the 1988 Act the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 allows District Court Justices to order the temporary closure of licensed premises where an off ence of illegal supply to a person under 18 is proven. The closure can be for 7 days for a fi rst off ence and up to a month for a second off ence. Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act 1988 The Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act 1988 reinforces the prohibition on the sale of cigarettes to those under 16. This Act also bans the sale of smokeless tobacco products such as Skoal Bandits and enabled the Minister for Health to introduce Regulations in 1990 prohibiting or restricting the use of tobacco in a large number of public areas including cinemas, theatres, trains, schools and public buildings. The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 amended the 1988 Act by increasing the age Iimit of those to whom tobacco may be sold from l6 to 18 and increases the fi ne to \u20ac1,905. Unrestricted Drugs There are some 'drugs' that we often don't think of as drugs, whose availability is not subject to any legal controls on sale or consumption. Included in this group is caff eine contained in drinks such as tea, coff ee and cola. The supply of organic solvents in the form of glues and aerosols is prohibited under Section 74 of the Child Care Act 1991, where there is reasonable cause to believe the substance will be inhaled by a person under 18 for the purpose of causing intoxication. The actual possession and misuse of these products is not an off ence. However a member of the Gardai Siochana may seize a substance that is being inhaled by a person under 18. The penalty for supplying such products to those under 18 may include a fi ne of up to \u20ac1,270 or 12 months in jail. Informal Controls It is said that the non-medical use of all drugs is subject to informal controls arising from custom and culture and from the requirements of everyday Iife. These controls are more likely to be eff ective with drugs that are a familiar part of the culture. This may explain why coff ee and tea are made available during the working day, while alcohol is generally reserved for after work. However, it has been pointed out that the level of acceptance of excessive alcohol consumption is very high in Ireland. Strengthening of informal controls such as the increasing unacceptability of drunken driving or the hardening of attitudes to incompetence at work due to alcohol, may be as important as legal controls in preventing excessive, harmful or inappropriate use of drugs.

Thus, 5-HTP is thought to be able to more directly infl uence Serotonin production within the Hypothalamus than L-Tryptophan did. 5-HTP is some 10 times more eff ective than ordinary L-Tryptophan. Short Term E ect: Euphoria, mental changes simulate to mild dose of psilocybin, appetite suppressant, relieves insomnia, calms anxiety, Long Term E ect: Anti allergenic , anti anxiety, anti depressant, astringent, diuretic, sleep aid, tonic, headaches, drowsiness, gastrointestinal discomfort, loss of muscle coordination, vomiting, appetite loss, diarrhoea, dilated pupils, nausea, diffi culty breathing anxiety. Dependency: No withdrawal or discontinuation eff ects. Excessive use could cause dietary amino acid imbalance Medical / Recreational Use: Anxiety, Arthritis, Depressed Mood, Eczema, Gout, Increase Milk Flow In Nursing Mothers, Insomnia, Migrane, Mild To Moderate Mood Changes Caused By Everyday Stress, Muscle & Joint Pain, Nervous Tension, Occasional Nervousness, Occasional Sleep Diffi culty, Promote Weight Loss, Regulates Sleep, Rheumatism, Stimulate Circulation. Due to the conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin by the liver there is a possible yet unproven risk of heart valve disease from serotonin's eff ect on the heart. Contradictions / Interactions: Large doses can trigger excess of serotonin formation in tissues other than the target organ and cause signifi cant adverse eff ects. It should not be used concurrently with any antidepressant, including ssris, tricyclics, or maois, otc cold remedies, muscle relaxants. 5-HTP should not be used by those with ischemic heart disease, coronary artery spasm, uncontrolled hypertension and any other signifi cant cardiovascular disease. 5-Htp has been used as a remedy to counter the withdrawal symptons that can occur after taking MDMA (a drug known for the depleting the serotonin in the brain). Do not use 5-HTP is you are currently taking any of the Alcoholic beverages; Intravenous drugs; antibiotic medications. Legality Ireland: U.K.and Ireland 5-HTP & L-Tryptophan legal and widely available from health food stores. 5HTP is found in the following products: Benzoberries, D ream weaver, trip2night, Trance, Use: Smoked, Sniff ed, Injected. Drug E ects: 5-MeO-DMT was fi rst synthesized in 1936. Traditionally 5-MeO-DMT has been used in psychedelic snuff made from Virola bark resin, and may be a trace constituent of Ayahuasca when plants such as Diplopterys cabrerana are used as an admixture. 5-MeO-DMT is also found in the venom of the Colorado River Toad (Bufo alvarius), although there is no direct evidence this was used as a hallucinogen until recent times.A naturally occurring very powerful psychedelic tryptamine found in many plants and some animals. It is found in a wide variety of plant and psychoactive toad species, and like its close relatives DMT and bufotenin (5-OH-DMT), it has been used as an entheogen by South American shamans for thousands of years. Like DMT, 5-MeO-DMT must be combined with MAOI's to become active orally. Short Term E ects: If smoked or injected the total duration is @ 5-20mins onset is 0-1 min, coming up 0-30secs, platuea 5-10mins, plateua15-25mins coming down, eff ects 1-3 hours.

Classifi cation: PsychedelicChemicalsSection 3 - Chemicals 165 ! ! Aniracetam is said to improve memory recall, increase intellectual clarity, improve immune function, and generate feelings of health and well-being, particularly in the elderly. Aniracetam's mechanism of action and function are not well understood. Aniracetam is a nootropic or smart drug, an analogue of piracetam, it can improve memory recall, reaction and detail. Like all of piracetam's analogues less aniracetam is required, (i.e. milligram dose per kilogram body weight). In tests, aniracetam has proven to be one of the most potent nootropics currently available, this is because of its ability to protect AMPA brain receptors and nerve cells. Short Term E ects: CNS Stimulant Long Term E ects: Sleeplessness, restlessness, anxiety, agitation at night or insomnia. Some users experience insomnia from an afternoon dose of Aniracetam. These users may fi nd it better to take both daily doses in the morning rather than taking the second dose after noon. Any usual side-eff ects should be discussed with a Doctor. Dependency: No information found. Withdrawal: No information found. Overdose Risk: No information found. Contradictions / Interactions: Pregnant women should consult their doctor before taking Aniracetam during pregnancy. Legality Ireland: Not listed under controlled substances.

Saccharose Sodium Amide Glycolatea substance which enhances protein fl as a food additive Sodium CyclamateAn artifi cially prepared salt of cyclamic acid, C6H12NO3SNa, formerly used as a low-calorie sweetener but now banned because of the possible carcinogenic eff ects of its metabolic products. Sodic Saccharine nutra sweetner Sorbitolalso known as glucitol, is a sugar alcohol that the body metabolises slowly. It is obtained by reduction of glucose changing the aldehyde group to an additional hydroxyl Street Names: 1-benzyl-1,4-diazacyclohexane, N-benzylpiperazine, A2, Legal X and Pep X., Party pills. Method Of Use: taken in powder and pill form Drug E ects: BZP has been shown to have a mixed mechanism of action, acting primarily on the serotonergic system. This means that there is an increased level of serotonin to act on surrounding serotonin receptors. BZP is often marketed allegedly as a \"dietary supplement\" to avoid meeting stricter laws that apply to medicines and drugs. This is despite the fact that BZP has no dietary value. Producers frequently claim that BZP is a \"natural\" product, describing it as a \"pepper extract\" or \"herbal high\" . In fact, the drug is entirely synthetic, not occurring naturally in any plant. Despite claims by some tablet and capsule suppliers that they are herbal products, piperazine and its derivatives are synthetic substances that do not occur naturally. History: BZP was originally used as a worming treatment for internal parasites in cattle - many piperazines have anti-parasitic eff ects; they paralyse the parasites and allow them to be fl ushed out of the host body. However, it turned out that BZP was fairly ineff ective and had signifi cant side eff ects. Short Term E ect: Arousal, euphoria, general feeling of well being , subtle similar to ecstasy and methamphetamine , anti parasitic, dietary supplement. Long Term E ect: Dilated pupils, dryness in mouth, severe hangover, problems with urine retention Medical / Recreational Use: BZP has no current human or veterinary pharmaceutical use in any country. BZP is sometimes erroneously described as an anthelminthic drug, neither BZP nor any other piperazine derivative is licensed for this purpose. As an agoinst at the 5HTP 2c receptor and an antagonist at the 5HTP 2b receptor,mCPP has been widely used as a probe of serotonin function in psychiatric research. An industrial use of mCPP is as an intermediate in the production of trazodone and three related substances. Trazodone is licensed in a number of EU states for the treatment of depression and other disorders. Contradictions / Interactions: Piperazines can interact with anti depressant medication. If you have a history of mental health issues, heart disorders or high blood pressure problems or are currently on any other medication please do not purchase this product.

The eff ects produced by BZP are comparable to those produced by amphetamine. Adverse eff ects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity, and seizures. No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP , although there have been at least two deaths from the combination of BZP and MDMA. Its sale is banned in a few countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. However, its legal status is currently less restrictive in some other countries such as Canada, with investigations and regulations pending under European Union laws.ChemicalsSection 3 - Chemicals 167 CP 47-497 Street Names: 2-[(1R,3S)-3-hydroxycyclohexyl]-5-(2- methyloctan-2-yl)phenol. Method Of Use: Smoked incense blend Drug E ects: A synthetic cannabanoid agonist without the classical cannabanoid chemical structure. It is used basic scientifi c research to identify cannabinoid receptors in the brain and study 9-THC's mechanisms of action. Behavioural pharmacology studies show it has THC like activity in animals and is likely to have THC-like psychoactive eff ects in humans. CP 47,497 homologues were recently purported to be found in the herbal mixture \"Spice\" , sold in European countries mainly via internet shops. History: CP 47,497 was invented in the 1980's, almost 30 years ago now. It was studied in animals quite extensively at that time and while it never proceeded to human trials, there is no indication that this was because of any toxicity problems References to toxicity testing of CP 47,497 states that it is very similar to THC itself including both acute toxicity and routes of metabolism. Short Term E ects: THC like experiences Long Term E ects: No information found Dependency: Dr Zimmermann has written an article in July 2009 entitled \"Withdrawal Phenomena and Dependence Syndrome after the Consumption of \"Spice Gold, \" in which it states that Spice a product including the chemical CP47-497 states that there is evidence of dependency. The authors postulate that dependency may be due to an admixture of synthetic cannabinomimetics such as JWH-018 and CP 47497 in \"Spice Gold, \" product. Withdrawal: There have been reports of withdrawal symptom when using Spice a product including the chemical CP47-497 including inner unrest, drug craving, nocturnal nightmares, profuse sweating, nausea, tremor, and headache. Overdose Risk: No information found Medical / Recreational Use: No information listed Contradictions / Interactions: No information listed Psychoactive Ingredient In: Spice Smoking Blend Legality Ireland: CP 47,497 and its homologues are not controlled Substances 168 DMAE Dimethylaminoethanol Description: Dimethylaminoethanol is a naturally occurring substance and is also known as DMAE or Deanol. In the 1960s and 1970s, DMAE was marketed as a prescription drug called Deaner. The FDA in America approved Deaner as \"possible eff ective\" for: Learning problems associated with underachieving and shortened attention span, Behavior problems associated with hyperactivity, combined hyperkinetic behavior and learning disorders with underachieving, reading and speech diffi culties, impaired motor coordination, and impulsive/compulsive behaviour, often described as asocial, antisocial, or delinquent. In 1983 the FDA demanded additional studies to prove the eff ectiveness of Deaner. These studies would have been more expensive than the product's sales could support and Deanor was removed from the market. However, DMAE has continued to be available as a nutritional supplement. Side E ects: This dietary supplement is considered safe when used in accordance with proper dosing guidelines. Side eff ects are possible with any dietary supplement. This dietary supplement may cause drowsiness, confusion, and a mild increase in blood pressure. Large doses of this dietary supplement have caused muscle tension in the neck, jaw, legs, and other areas. Tell your doctor if these side eff ects become severe or do not go away Health Conditions: If you have a history of mood disorders, attention defi cit disorder or depression talks to your doctor before taking this dietary supplement. Pregnancy/Breast-Feeding: To date, the medical literature has not reported any adverse eff ects related to fetal development during pregnancy or to infants who are breast-fed. Yet little is known about the use of this dietary supplement while pregnant or breast-feeding. Therefore, it is recommended that you inform your healthcare practitioner of any dietary supplements you are using while pregnant or breast-feeding. CH3 H3C OHN ChemicalsSection of Use: DMT is a solid made up of crystals it can be white, pink, or orange in colour, smoked injected or orally taken. Standard dose for smoked N, N-DMT is between 15-60 mg. This is generally smoked in a few successive breaths until the user is unable (or unwilling) to take another hit off the pipe or bong. Most users report needing to wait an hour or so between attempts, even if eff ects are not achieved. Drug E ects: DMT is a powerful, visual psychedelic which produces short-acting eff ects when smoked. It is used orally in combination with an MAOI, as in ayahuasca brews. It is naturally produced in the human brain and by many plants.Although man has used DMT as a hallucinogenic drug for thousands of years (in things such as Ayahuasca and to a lesser extent Cebil and Yopo), it was not isolated in its pure form until 1931. Even after it was fi rst isolated, it took over 20 years (until 1956) before the compound was shown to be a hallucinogenic (in its pure form). DMT is not orally active unless it is mixed with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Short Term E ects: it is one of the most powerful psychedelic known. It causes intense visuals and strong psychedelic mental eff ects when smoked, injected, snorted or (when taken with MAOI such as Haramaline) when swallowed orally. Orally the total duration is 2-6 hours when smoked or injected it lasts 6-20mins, onset 0-1 min, coming up 0-30 after eff ects 15-60 mins. Change in Perception of Time, Colour shifting, Immersive Experiences, Intense Eye Open Visuals, Powerful 'Rushing' of Sensation, Radical Perspective Shifting, Change in perception of time, Auditory hallucinations (buzzing). Long Term E ects: Auditory hallucination (buzzing), overly-intense experiences, disorientation. Hard on the lungs, slight stomach discomfort, diffi culty integrating experiences, overwhelming fear, fast onset & intensity can lead to problems if not prepared Contradictions / Interactions: DMT is not orally active unless it is mixed with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi) such as those found in alkaloids produced by plants like Banisteriopsis caapi (Ayahuasca vine). Without a maoi the human body quickly breaks down DMT that has been ingested orally and it has very little psychoactive eff ect. The eff ects of smoked N, N-DMT are dramatically increased if used by individuals currently taking MAOIs. Check with a Doctor not sure whether a prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not stand up. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as N, N-DMT as they can trigger even more diffi culty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems. MAOI'S are a family of anti-depressant medications still occasionally in use. Eg Hydrazines, St DMT is neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependence. As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There may be a short period of tolerance after DMT use. Medical / Recreational Use: Used mostly for its psychoactive eff ects. No known medical use. Neurobiologists are yet uncertain about the role DMT might play in the nervous system. Hyperventilating causes the concentration of DMT in the lungs to increase.

Methods of smoked total duration hours , onset 20-90 after eff ects Drug E ects: Ephedrine is a common CNS stimulant used to treat breathing problems and nasal congestion, present in the herb Ephedra sinica. Ephedrine is sold in herbal supplements, diet aids and as a pure chemical. It is generally found in capsule or tablet form and is usually taken orally. It is a main precursor in the production of MDMA due to its similarity in structure to the (semi) synthetic derivatives amphetamine and methamphetamine. Short term e ects: Feel more alert & focused, mild burst of energy, reduced appetite, stimulating eff ects, sensitive skin, can produce positive test for amphetamines, improves concentration, anxiety, death, dizziness, dry mouth, heart palpitations, increased blood pressure, increased body temperature, increased heart rate, insomnia, restlessness, sweating, tremors, vomiting Long Term E ects: Long-Term recreational misuse has been linked to strokes & heart attack. Dependency: Reports have found it to be addictive. Medical / Recreational Use: Due to its eff ects on respiration, ephedrine has long been used as an ingredient in over-the-counter cold, allergy, and asthma products. Pseudephedrine is widely sold as a decongestant while ephedrine is a commonly used stimulant. There have been deaths associated with higher dose use of Ephedrine. Overdose can lead to dangerously increased pulse rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Overdoses are treated like those of other stimulant overdoses. Ephedrine dilates bronchioles making breathing easier. Some strands of the plant Ephedra are smoked for a cannabis substitute. Reports have suggested that it helps studying, thinking or concentration to a greater extent than caff eine Contradictions / Interactions: Should not be combined with maoi's, it also suppresses the eff ects of alcohol (giving you the illusion that your body isn't intoxicated). It should not be used with certain anti-depressants, namely SNRI's (serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors). It should be used with caution in patients with inadequate fl uid replacement, impaired adrenal function, hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes cardiovascular delivery if maternal lactation. Psychoactive Ingredient In: Herbal Fuel, Chi Powder, Zest. Ephedrine is included in many over the counter cold remedies. Legality Ireland: It is a category 1 precursor in Ireland. Therefore it is controlled under the substance misuse acts and can only be available with a prescription.

Legality Ireland: Not listed as a controlled substance. Drugs that enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity by interacting at post-synaptic GABA(A) receptors have long been used as hypnotics, sedatives, tranquillizers and anticonvulsants. Benzodiazepines seemed to rapidly gain popularity replacing barbiturates in the 1970's and becoming the most commonly prescribed of all drugs in the Western world. Problems such as dependence and withdrawal reactions became apparent in the 1980s, and it seemed that the usefulness of drugs with this mode of action was limited. Recently, focus has shifted to a new group of drugs with GABA-ergic actions mediated through various mechanisms not directly involving the GABA(A) receptor. These drugs include gabapentin, vigabatrin, tiagabine, lamotrigine, pregabalin and others. Although originally developed as anticonvulsants for epilepsy, they appear to have wider applications for use in aff ective disorders, especially bipolar depression, anxiety disorders and pain conditions. ChemicalsSection 3 - Chemicals 173 Harmine Street Names: 7-Methoxyl-1-methyl-9H-pyrido (3,4-b), (7-methoxy-1-methyl-b-carboline). Methods of Use: Snorted, Injected. Each dose of pure harmine can be sold in 200mg amber bottles. Four grams of Peganum harmala made into tea is roughly as potent as 200 mg of harmine. Drug E ects: Harmine is a hallucinogenic alkaloid found in the seed coats of a plant (Peganum harmala) Syrrian Rue of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East, and also in a South American vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) Ayhausca vine from which natives of the Andes Mountains prepared a drug for religious and medicinal use. Harmine and related alkaloids are Serotonin Antagonists, Hallucinogen, harmala alkaloid belonging to the beta-carboline family of compounds. Also found in butterfl ies of the family Nymphalidea. Chemically, harmine is an indole hallucinogen that can block the action of serotonin (the indole amine transmitter of nerve impulses) in brain tissue. Harmine occurs as the free alkaloid and may be converted to the hydrochloride salt, which is more soluble. Both are crystalline in form. Short Term E ects: drowsy or dream like state, small dose stimulant, large dose hallucinogenic, irritating to nasal passages, depress CNS, progressive CNS paralysis. Nervous stimulated feeling, caff eine like eff ect, nausea, confusion, numbness, and other unpleasant eff ects. Small doses act as mild and therapeutic cerebral stimulant, sometimes producing drowsy or dreamy state for 1-2 hours. Larger doses up to may have hallucinogenic eff ect, the intensity of which varies widely with the individual. Larger doses taken with LSD or psiolcybin alter the quality of the experience of the latter. Telepathic experiences have been reported with this combination. Long Term E ects: Plants containing harmine are often used in combination with plants containing DMT or other tryptamine hallucinogens in order to increase their potency and duration of action since their breakdown is inhibited by the harmine. Harmine is generally used in this manner although there are reports of it having hallucinogenic eff ects on its own. Medical / Recreational Use: The beta carboline alkaloids such as harmaine are present in medicinal plants such as Peganum Harmala that have been used as folk medicine in anti cancer therapy. Contradictions / Interactions: Brief MAO inhibitor. Harmine is a brief MAO inhibitor. It should not be used with alcohol and certain foods and drugs (see list). When snuff ed, harmine may be slightly irritating to nasal passages. Large amounts may depress CNS. Since individual sensitivity varies this may occur with larger doses. Diff erent harmala alkaloids vary in potency. with DMT to produce a hallucinogenic eff ect. Also used in Peganum harmala tea form as an MAOI to make DMT orally active and to improve the eff ects of psilocybin mushrooms. Legality Ireland: Harmine has no abuse potential and is not a controlled substance. Classifi cation: Hallucinogen Classifi HU-210 is a synthetic cannabinoid, sstructurally and pharmacologically similar to THC (the main active ingredient of cannabis), used in basic scientifi c research to identify cannabanoid receptors in the brain and study the mechanisms of action of THC. HU-210 is 100 to 800 times more potent than natural THC from Cannabis and has an extended duration of action. It was recently purported to be found in the herbal mixture \"Spice\" . Short Term E ects: Anti-Anxiety, Antidepressant. HU-210 is a research chemical. Research chemicals are experimental chemicals that are not approved for human consumption. This is because not enough data exists currently about their side eff ects, adverse reactions, long term damage, addiction potential, etc. Although some people are willing to ingest research chemicals, it is not reasonable to assume that they are in any way safe to use recreationally. Long Term E ects: Fatal In Large Amounts Medical / Recreational Use: Hyperactivity Contradictions / Interactions: No information listed. Warning: Fatal In Large Amounts Psychoactive Ingredient In: Spice Smoking Blend Legality Ireland: In August 2009, the U.K. is moving towards banning Spice products. HU-211 is Uncontrolled in the United States. Although, it may fall under the analog act since it is it is categorized as a THC substance and is similar to those THC substances that occur naturally in marijuana. What is THC? Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the active chemical in cannabis and is one of the oldest hallucinogenic drugs known. There is evidence that cannabis extracts were used by the Chinese as an herbal remedy since the fi rst century AD. Cannabis comes from the fl owering tops and leaves of the hemp plant, Cannabis sativa. Cannabis is more commonly known as the source of the marijuana drug, although the word marijuana applies both to the whole plant and to the resin from it (although this is sometimes also called hashish).ChemicalsSection 3 - Chemicals 175 structurally similar to 9- tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC), the main active ingredient of marijuana. It was synthesized around 1988. It is used in scientifi c research as a pharmacological tool to study the brain, and is being explored for several therapeutic uses. It was recently purported to be found in the herbal mixture \"Spice\" , sold in European countries mainly via internet shops. HU-211 is not a controlled substance in the U.S. Short Term E ects: Anti Anxiety, anti depressant, fatal in large amounts Long Term E ects: HU-211 ((6aS,10aS)-9-(hydroxymethyl)-6,6-dimethyl-3-(2-methyloctan-2-yl)- 6a,7,10,10a-tetrahydrobenzo[c]chromen-1-ol; (+)-11-OH-8-THC-DMH, dexanabinol; categorized as a tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) similar in chemical structure to 9-THC, 8-THC, and other THC substances controlled under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The chemical structures of HU-211 (left) and 8-THC (right), a compound found in Cannabis sativa and representative of the THC structural class. Dependency: Dexanabinol (HU-211) is a synthetic cannabinoid derivative, which \"unnatural\" enantiomer of the potent cannabinoid agonist HU-210.[1] Unlike other cannabinoid derivatives, HU-211 does not act as a cannabinoid receptor agonist, but instead has NMDA antagonist eff ects.[2] It therefore not produce cannabis-like eff ects, Withdrawal: None Overdose Risk: no information found Medical / Recreational Use: HU-211 is used in basic scientifi c research as a NMDA receptor blocker. It is also being explored in pre-clinical and clinical research for several therapeutic applications including brain damage related to stroke, traumatic brain injury, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis. Contradictions / Interactions: No Information Found Psychoactive Ingredient In: Spice Smoking Blend Legality Ireland: HU-211 is currently not controlled under the CSA Classifi Names: (1-Pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole). Of Use: Smoked coming up Almost instantly, Plateau 3-5 hours can also be sold as pure white powder. Drug E ects: The synthetic substance, JWH-018, a cannabinoid receptor agonist from the aminoalkylindole family, has been found in herbal mixtures sold legally under various 'spice' names, such as Spice Gold and Spice Yucatan Fire. The mixture is sold as incense, but is smoked to get high. JWH-018 is a synthetic cannabinoid, which has almost the same eff ect as THC on the human brain. It has approximately 5 times greater affi nity for the CP1 receptor than THC and is more potent than THC in humans and animals. JWH-018 IS used in basic scientifi c research, to identify cannabinoid receptors in the brain. JWH-018 is purported to be an ingredient in the herbal mixture \"Spice\" which may be smoked for its psychoactive eff ects. Designed by JW Huff man, JWH-018 is a chemical substance fi rst synthesized in 1995 in a university lab in the US for purely experimental purposes is now being used by young people around the world to legally achieve a marijuana-like high and is causing alarm among health offi cials in Europe. Short Term E ect: colour enhancement, euphoria, sedation, anti depressant, catalepsy, dry sore throat, decreases body temp insomnia, lethargy, mild diarrhea, mild headache, mild paranoia, nausea. Long Term E ect: JWH-018 is four to fi ve times more potent than tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly known as THC, which is the main psychoactive substance in cannabis, JWH-018's chemical structure does not look at all like THC, but it produces the same eff ects. Medical / Recreational Use: Anxiety, hunger aid, sleep aid, withdrawal. Contradictions / Interactions: JWH-018 has not been licensed anywhere in the world for medical applications and little is known about the eff ect on humans, as not even pre-clinical studies have been to determine potential toxicity.

Cannabis is more commonly known as the source of the marijuana drug, although the word marijuana applies both to the whole plant and to the resin from it (although this is sometimes also called hashish). Marijuana is an synonymous with American culture.ChemicalsSection 3 - Chemicals 177 Classifi cation: Pain Reliever CannabanoidJWH-073 Street Names: (1-Butyl-3-(1-Naphthoyl)indole) Spice smoking blend Slang: Names given to herbal smoking mixtures come and go. Some current names for Spice products are: Spice Silver, Spice Gold, Spice Diamond, Spice Arctic Synergy, Spice Tropical Synergy, Spice Egypt, Spice Yukatan Fire, San Pedro Cactus, EcSess, Amsterdam Gold, Devil's Weed. Methods of Use: Smoke Drug E ects: JWH-073, 1-butyl-3-naphthoylindole, is a member of the JWH family. JWH-073 is an active cannabinoid although less potent than JWH-018, with fast onset. Eff ects are described as slightly milder than others in the series although anxiety may be seen in susceptible people when doses are too high. JWH-073 is a synthetic Cannabinoid agonist without the classical Cannabinoid chemical structure. It is used in scientifi c research as a tool to study the Cannabinoid system. It has a THC-like psychoactive eff ect on humans. It was recently purported to be found in the herbal mixture \"Spice\" , sold in European countries mainly via internet shops. Short Term E ects: Anxiety Long Term E ects: Experts are concerned that Spice products containing synthetic cannabinoids have the potential to be more harmful than cannabis due to the way they are made and because the compounds present and their quantity - and hence their potency - will be unknown to the user. Some compounds used in Spice may have a very long duration of action. Some batches of the product might be much more or less potent than others Medical / Recreational Use: JWH-073 is used in basic scientifi c research to identify cannabinoid receptors in the brain and study 9-THC's mechanisms of action. Regular use of products containing stronger synthetic cannabinoids may increase the risk of later developing psychotic illnesses including schizophrenia. Contradictions / Interactions: Although little evidence exists at the moment about the harmful eff ects of Spice, experts conclude that it is very likely that synthetic cannabinoids will produce harmful e ects similar to those associated with THC - the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis. Psychoactive Ingredient In: JWH-073 is purported to be an ingredient in the herbal mixture \"Spice\" which may be smoked for its psychoactive eff ects. No information on the illicit use of JWH-073 in the U.S. is available at this time. Legality Ireland: it is not controlled in the U.S. What is a synthetic Cannabinoid ? These mimic the psychoactive eff ects of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active principle in cannabis, and are found in 'herbal' smoking mixtures commonly sold as 'Spice' on the internet and in specialist 'headshops' . Synthetic cannabinoid compounds are sprayed on to a mix of inert plant ingredients, usually free of tobacco or cannabis, to produce these smoking mixtures. It is not certain that every product sold as Spice will contain synthetic cannabinoids, only forensic testing will tell. There are a large number of potential cannabinoids that can be synthesized with JWH being the predominant chemical family and JWH-018 the most commonly used compound to date. It is reported that herbal smoking mixes are imported into the UK from China. ChemicalsPsychoactive Substances 178L-Arginine Street is a protein amino acid present in the proteins of all life forms. It is classifi ed as a semi-essential or conditionally essential amino acid. This means that under normal circumstances the body can synthesize suffi cient L-arginine to meet physiological demands. There are, however, conditions where the body cannot. L-arginine is essential for young children and for those with certain rare genetic disorders in which synthesis of the amino acid is impaired. Some stress conditions that put an increased demand on the body for the synthesis of L-arginine include trauma (including surgical trauma), sepsis and burns. Under these conditions, L-arginine becomes essential, and it is then very important to ensure adequate dietary intake of the amino acid to meet the increased physiological demands created by these situations. In larger amounts, stimulates the release of Human Growth Hormone and Prolactin. Used for weight-loss in combination with L-Ornithine It helps the body get rid of ammonia is used to make compounds in the body such Creatine, Nitric Oxide, L-Glutamate, And L-Proline, and can be converted to glucose and glycogen if needed. Short Term E ects: L-arginine helps in stimulating & maintaining erection, anti-atherogenic, antioxidant, decreases blood pressure, increase blood sugar levels, vasodilator, high doses - toxic, indigestion, nausea, headache. Long Term E ects: No Information Found. Medical / Recreational Use: Aids immune response, erectile dysfunction, heart disease, helps stored fat metabolism, high blood pressure, increase sperm counts, intermittent claudication, interstitial cystitis, migraines, required for production of growth hormone, sexual dysfunction in women, tone muscle tissue, wound healing. Contradictions / Interactions: L-Arginine may counteract the Nsaids (non-steroidal anti-infl ammatories) or other drugs that are hard on the stomach, alter potassium levels in the body, such as ace inhibitors and potassium sparing diuretics, antihypertensive drugs should not be combined with L-Arginine. Do not use l-arginine if pregnant or breast-feeding, have allergies or asthma, cirrhosis of liver, herpes, low blood pressure, recently had a heart attack, scheduled for surgery in the next two weeks. Psychoactive Ingredient In: Cok-N-Legal cocaine, Frozen. Legality Ireland: Legal. Classifi cation: Weight ChemicalsSection 3 - Chemicals 179 L-Aspartic Acid Description: l-Aspartic Acid is an ammonia neutraliser. It is used as a dietary supplement, detergent, fungicide, germicide synthetic sweetener base. Aspartic acid combines with other amino acids to form compounds that absorb and remove toxins from the bloodstream. It has been shown to improve stamina.Aspartic acid is, together with glutamic acid, classifi ed as an acidic amino acid Aspartic acid is not an essential amino acid, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans. Aspartic acid is found in: 1. Animal sources: luncheon meats, sausage meat, wild game. 2. Vegetable sources: sprouting seeds, oat fl akes, avocado, asparagus, young sugarcane, and molasses from sugar beets. Dietary supplements, either as aspartic acid itself or salts (such as magnesium aspartate). The sweetener aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal, Canderel, etc.). Aspartic acid is a Non-Essential Amino Acid having an acidic carboxyl group on its side chain which can serve as both an acceptor and a donor of ammonia. It is converted to L-Asparagine by binding with ammonia. E ects: It is found in plants, especially in sprouting seeds. In protein it exists mainly as asparagine. Defi ciency symptoms of Aspartic Acid may include fatigue and depression. Product Found In: l-aspartic acid. ChemicalsPsychoactive Substances 180 L-Carnitine Description: Caranitine is a nutrient that helps the body turn fat into energy. It is produced by the body in the liver and kidneys and stored in the skeletal muscles, heart, brain, and sperm. Usually, the body can make all the carnitine it needs. Some people, however, may be defi cient in carnitine because their bodies cannot make enough carnitine or transport it into tissues so it can be used. Some other conditions, such as angina or intermittent claudication, can also cause insuffi cient carnitine in the body, as can some medications. Carnitine has been proposed as a treatment for many conditions because it helps reduce oxidative stress. Some of the conditions carnitine may help treat are serious, and in those cases, you should take the supplement under the supervision of your doctor, as an adjunct therapy to conventional medicine. For other conditions, such as fatigue or improving exercise performance, carnitine appears safe but seems to have little eff ect. Although L-carnitine has been marketed as a weight loss supplement, there is no scientifi c evidence to show that it improves weight loss, however some studies show that oral carnitine reduces fat mass, increases muscle mass, and reduces fatigue. All of these eff ects may contribute to weight loss. Precautions: Because supplements may have side eff ects or interact with medications, you should take them only under the supervision of a knowledgeable health care provider. Side e ects: are generally mild. High doses (5 or more grams per day) may cause diarrhea. Other rare side eff ects include increased appetite, body odour, and rash. People with the following conditions should talk to their doctor before taking carnitine: Peripheral vascular disease , Hypertension (high blood pressure) , Alcohol-induced liver disease (cirrhosis), Diabetes, Kidney disease, Possible Interactions: If you are currently being treated with any of the following medications, you should not use carnitine without fi rst talking to your health care provider. Product Found In: TNT Energy Pills. NOH O O+ - L-Carnitine ChemicalsSection 3 - Chemicals 181L-Crysteine Description: Cysteine, a nonessential amino acid, is one of the 20 building blocks of protein. Cysteine is a part of organic molecules containing an amino group, which can combine in linear arrays to form proteins in living organisms. Cysteine can be synthesized by the body and is not essential to the diet. Its key chemical feature is a thiol group that contains sulfur. Cysteine is a naturally occurring hydrophobic amino acid which has a sulfhydryl group and is found in most proteins, however only in small quantities.. It can be taken as a supplement in the form of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) helps break down mucus and detoxify harmful substances in the body. Both cysteine and NAC have been shown to increase levels of the antioxidant glutathione. This thiol group can combine with the thiol group of another cysteine to form a disulfi de bridge, which helps structural proteins and enzymes maintain their confi guration. Two cysteine molecules linked by a disulfi de bridge make up the amino acid cystine. Crystine is its stable form, Antioxidant, contains sulfur, protects cellular membranes, from free radical damage, prevents alcohol and cigarette smoke damage to the brain stimulant to immune system, believed to be good antiaging, eff ective against copper toxicity, protects against x-ray and nuclear radiation, may aff ect insulin eff ectiveness. ChemicalsPsychoactive Substances 182L-Glutamine Description: L-glutamine is converted to glutamic acid the brains emergency source of energy when glucose is in short supply. It is a precursor to the neurotransmitter GABA. It neutralizes excess ammonia which can inhibit proper brain function. It is said it improve intelligence, it is said to help to control alcoholism and helps to speed ulcer healing , alleviates fatigue, depression, impotence, schizophrenia, senility. Side E ects: Taking excessive amounts has led to upset stomachs. Glutamine is also marketed as a supplement used for muscle growth in weightlifting, bodybuilding, endurance, and other sports, yet there is still no scientifi c evidence of its \"muscle growing\" proclaimed properties Products Found In: Solar Water What is Solar Water? Solar Water is described as an anti anxiety and GHB alternative. It is an IGF and HGH are stimulant along with being muscle recuperation and revitalise enhancers. Active constituents acid \" triple threat\" antiaging, antioxidant, anti tumor agent, respiratory accelerator in the brain, used in the treatment of allergies, cataracts, diabetes, hypoglycemia, arthritis, prevnets some side eff ects of chemotherapy and x ray radiations protects against some harmful side eff ects of cigarette smoke and alcohol. L -gluathione is a nonprotein thiol that is found in the body. The compound plays an important role in detoxifi cation, and can protect cells from free radical damage. Long-term side eff ects remain unknown, because this compound is still undergoing research trials. Function: L-glutathione is an antioxidant involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates. It is responsible for stimulating CD8 cells, which play a role in the health and growth of the body's tissues. This antioxidant also plays an important role in the detoxifi cation of the liver E ects: Some researchers claim that L-glutathione may have anticancer eff ects when administered intravenously. Athletes and bodybuilders who undertake hard training can deplete glutathione levels, and in these cases, L-glutathione supplementation may be benefi cial for optimal performance and for building muscle. Others claim that L-glutathione pills have the ability to whiten the skin, but these claims are unconfi rmed and not backed by scientifi c research. Product Found In: Not listed ChemicalsPsychoactive Substances 184 L-lysine Method of Use: Lysine is available in tablets, capsules, creams, and liquids, and is usually sold in the L-lysine form. Description: Lysine, or L-lysine, is an essential amino acid, nneeded for growth and enzyme, hormone anti body production. Side E ects: Aids concentration, treatment for sterility problems, treatment and prevention of herpes infections, aids fatty acids to energy conversion Not enough lysine can cause fatigue, nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite, agitation, bloodshot eyes, slow growth, anemia, and reproductive disorders Medical Contraindications: Because of the potential for side eff ects and interactions with medications, dietary supplements should be taken only under the supervision of a knowledgeable health care provider. Lysine in the diet is considered safe. High doses have caused gallstones and a rise in cholesterol levels in animals. People with kidney or liver disease should ask their doctor before taking supplemental lysine. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not take supplemental lysine without talking to their doctor. Possible Interactions: If you are currently being treated with any of the following medications or supplements, you should not use lysine supplements without fi rst talking to your health care provider.

Description: Methionine is sulfur containing essential amino acid and was fi rst isolated in 1922 from casein and belongs to a group of compounds called lipotropics - the others in this group include choline, inositol, and betaine. It is important in the process of methylation where methyl is added to compounds as well as being a precursor to the amino acids cystine and cysteine. Is an antioxidant, contains sulfur prevents damage of brain cells from toxic heavy metals, important in producing neurotransmitters and energy, lowers blood level of histamine, E ects: It is also one of the three amino acids needed by the body to manufacture creatine monohydrate, a compound essential for energy production and muscle building. It has been suggested that a high intake of methionine, in the presence of B vitamin defi ciencies, may increase the risk for arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) by increasing blood levels of cholesterol and a compound called homocysteine; and that excessive methionine intake, with an inadequate intake of folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, may increase the rate of conversion of methionine to homocysteine Side E ects: Breathing problems or tightness in your throat or chest , Chest pain , Skin hives, rash, or itchy or swollen skin Upset stomach and vomiting has been reported with taking large amounts of Methionine and SAMe (S-Adensyl methionine) Contraindications: People with liver problems, pancreatitis, HIV/AIDS as well as Parkinson's disease may consider obtaining more methionine, after consultation with their health professional, and older people may also benefi t from a slightly higher intake of this nutrient. Women on birth control pills could also look at this nutrient, since it promotes the excretion of estrogen. People suff ering from schizophrenia could investigate taking extra methionine since it reduces the level of histidine in the body, a level normally higher in people suff ering from schizophrenia. ChemicalsPsychoactive Substances 186DL-Phenylalanine Description: Is a combination of synthetic D and natural L phenylalanine. It produces endorphins and stimulates their use thus eff ective painkiller, often better than the opiate derivatives such as morphine. It is non-addictive and non toxic.

Side E ects: DL-phenylalanine may cause symptoms of anxiety, jitteriness, and hyperactivity in children. Medical Interactions: DL-phenylalanine should not be used in people taking antipsychotic drugs, as it may cause or make worse symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesias (TDs) are involuntary movements of the tongue, lips, face, trunk, and limbs that can occur in people taking antipsychotic drugs long term. Product found in: 1Fast400. ChemicalsSection 3 - Chemicals 187 L-Taurin Description: Non essential amino acid, aids effi cient conduction of electrical impulses along nerve pathways. It is an anti convulsant especially in combination with glumatic, aspartic acid. Taurine is involved in a number of crucial physiological processes. However, the role of taurine in these processes is not clearly understood and the infl uence of high taurine doses on these processes is uncertain. L-Taurine has a potential to stimulate the hypothalamus and to modify neuroendocrine function. It may also be necessary to take into consideration that absorption of taurine from beverages may be more rapid than from foods. Taurine is regularly used as an ingredient in energy drinks. A 2003 study by the European Food Safety Authority found no adverse eff ects for up to 1,000 mg of Taurine per kilogram of bodyweight per day; however this was in regards to Taurine alone, noting they did not compare the eff ects of Taurine when combined with the other ingredients in energy drinks. A review published in 2008 found no documented reports of negative health eff ects associated with the amount of taurine used in energy drinks, concluding that \"The amounts of guarana, taurine, and ginseng found in popular energy drinks are far below the amounts expected to deliver either therapeutic benefi ts or adverse events.

Method of Use: Synthetic and extracted crystalline Duration: Total Duration 4-8 hours Onset 45-60mins, plateau 1-4 hours, after eff ects 2-4 hours. Drug E ects: Mescaline is considered one of the classic psychedelic / entheogens, with a long history of traditional use in Central America (in the form of cacti), formalized modern ritual use in the Native American Church, considered by many experienced users as uniquely powerful, and widely known throughout the world because of the many accounts of its use. It is best known as the primary active chemical in small spineless the San Pedro and Peyote Cactus (Lophophora williamsi). Mescaline is also found in certain members of the Fabaceae (bean family). Both synthetic and extracted crystalline mescaline is available on the underground markets, but both are rare and usually quite expensive. It was fi rst isolated by Arthur Heff ter in 1897 when he was trying to identify the mind-altering principals in peyote. Short Term E ects: Mescaline containing cacti can induce severe vomiting and nausea, which adds an important part to traditional Native-American or Shaman ceremonies as it is considered cleansing. Long Term E ects: Altered state of consciousness, euphoria dream like state, laughing, anxiety, Diarrhoea, Dizziness Headaches, Revulsion Tachycardia, Visual Hallucinations Vomiting. Medical / Recreational Use: No information listed. Dosage: Mescaline concentration in cacti varies from one species to the next. Peyote is traditionally eaten in pairs of buttons, with anywhere from a single pair (2 buttons) to dozens of pairs of buttons (24 or more) being consumed over the course of an evening/night. Dosages of columnar cacti like San Pedro and Peruvianus are generally measured by the number of inches of cacti consumed Contradictions / Interactions: Mescaline. Legality: Mescaline (as well as Peyote) is Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license.

Compounds Classifi cation: Stimulant Facts about Bitter Orange: The extract of bitter orange (and bitter orange peel) has been used in dietary supplements as an aid to fat loss and as an appetite suppressant, although in traditional Chinese medicine it is always prescribed with other support herbs, not in isolation. Bitter orange contains synephrine, a substance similar to ephedrine, which acts on the 1 adrenergic receptor to constrict blood vessels and increase blood pressure and heart rate.Following bans on the herbal stimulant ephedra in the U.S., Canada, and elsewhere, bitter orange has been substituted into \"ephedra-free\" herbal weight-loss products by dietary suppliment manufacturers. While bitter orange has not undergone formal safety testing, it can cause the same spectrum of adverse events as ephedra. Case reports have linked bitter orange supplements to strokes, angina,] and ischemic colitis. The fact that bitter orange is a stimulant which constricts blood vessels and increases bloodpressure and heart rate means that it is thermogenic, increasing metabolism, and an appetite suppressant. These three property are a large contributing factor to fat loss, supporting any diet.ProductsSection 4 - Products 233 Crank'd Method of use: Taken in pill form Drug e ects: 1 or 2 Crank'd BZP Free pills will make you feel energetic, alert and lively for 5 to 6 hours.

Drug e ects: Gives relaxing, euphoric eff ects. The diff erence between Spice products is concentration of extracts.

It is dissolved in liquid has been packaged in small vials or small water bottles. In liquid form. Description: 1, 4-Butanediol is the organic compound with the formula HOCH 2CH 2CH 2CH 2OH. This colorless viscous liquid is derived from butane by placement of alcohol groups at each end of the chain. It is one of four stable isomers of butanediol. Common places of origin: GHB / BD is produced illegally in both domestic and foreign clandestine laboratories. The major source of GHB on the street is through clandestine synthesis by local operators. At bars or \"rave\" parties, has the potential for diversion and abuse like any other pharmaceutical containing a controlled substance. GHB has been encountered in nearly every region of the country. The GHB analogues GBL and BD are available legally as industrial solvents used to produce polyurethane, pesticides, elastic fi bers, pharmaceuticals, coatings on metal or plastic, and other products. These analogs also are sold illicitly as supplements for bodybuilding, fat loss, reversal of baldness, improved eyesight, and to combat aging, depression, drug addiction, and insomnia. GBL and BD are sold as \"fi sh tank cleaner, \" \"ink remover, \" cleaner\" and \"nail enamel remover\" for approximately $100 per bottle - much more expensive than comparable products. Law enforcement's eff orts to identify the abuse of GHB analogs are hampered by the fact that routine toxicological screens do not detect the presence of these analogues. Short Term E ects: It is also used as a recreational drug known by some users as \"One Comma (GHB), which is a metabolic product of 1,4-butanediol. Anecdotal reports indicate that 1, 4-butanediol produces a strong toxic feeling not present with GHB when ingested. These reports also indicate that it may cause damage to the liver as well as to other vital organs. Abuse has also resulted in addiction and death. Methods of abuse: GHB and its analogues are abused for their euphoric and calming eff ects and because some people believe they build muscles and cause weight loss. GHB and its analogues are also misused for their ability to increase libido, suggestibility, passivity, and to cause amnesia (no memory of events while under the infl uence of the substance) - traits that make users vulnerable to sexual assault and other criminal acts. GHB abuse became popular among teens and young adults at dance clubs and \"raves\" in the 1990s and gained notoriety as a date rape drug. GHB is taken alone or in combination with other drugs, such as alcohol (primarily), other depressants, stimulants, hallucinogens and cannabis. The average dose ranges from 1 to 5 grams (depending on the purity of the compound, this can be 1-2 teaspoons mixed in a beverage). However, the concentrations of these \"home-brews\" have varied so much that users are not usually aware of the actual dose they are drinking. A ect on mind: GHB occurs naturally in the central nervous system in very small amounts. Use of GHB produces Central Nervous System (CNS) depressant eff ects including euphoria, drowsiness, decreased anxiety, confusion and memory impairment. GHB can also produce visual hallucinations as well as - paradoxically - excited and aggressive behavior. GHB greatly increases the CNS depressant eff ects of alcohol and other depressants. A ect on body: GHB takes eff ect in 15 to 30 minutes, and the eff ects last 3 to 6 hours. Low doses of GHB produce nausea. At high doses, GHB overdose can result in unconsciousness, seizures, slowed heart rate, greatly slowed breathing, lower body temperature, vomiting, nausea, coma or death. Regular use of GHB can lead to addiction and withdrawal that includes insomnia, anxiety, tremors, increased heart rate and blood pressure and occasional psychotic thoughts.

GHB analogues are known to produce side eff ects such as topical irritation to the skin and eyes, nausea, vomiting, incontinence, loss of consciousness, seizures, liver damage, kidney failure, respiratory depression and even death. Drugs causing similar e ects: GHB analogues are often abused in place butyrolactone) and 1,4 BD (butanediol) metabolize GHB when you produce eff ects similar to GHB. CNS depressants such as barbiturates ects similar to GHB. Overdose e ects: As noted above, a GHB overdose can kill you. Legality: While 1,4-butanediol is not currently scheduled federally in the United States, a number of states have classifi ed 1,4-butanediol as a controlled substance. Additionally, individuals have been prosecuted for 1,4-butanediol under the Federal Analog Act as substantially similar to GHB. Scheduling of 1,4-butanediol on a federal level seems unlikely considering its legitimate industrial applications. AddendumPsychoactive Substances 360 2C-B- BZP Method Of Use: taken in tablet form Description: 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-1-benzylpiperazine (2C-B-BZP) is a psychoactive drug and research chemical of the piperazine chemical class which has been sold as a \"designer drug\" . It produces stimulant eff ects similar of benzylpiperazine (BZP). Chemistry: 2C-B-BZP contains a benzylpiperazine base as ring-substitution pattern of the psychedelic phenethylamine 2C-B, although 2C-B-BZP is not a phenethylamine itself and does not produce psychedelic eff ects as the binding groups are in the wrong position to activate the 5-HT2A receptor. Side E ects: 2C-B-BZP produces stimulant eff ects which last 3-6 hours. It is also said by several sources to increase the eff ects of other compounds when combined. Side eff ects include headaches and nausea, similar to those of other recreationally-used piperazine derivatives. Legality: 2C-B-BZP is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, but possession and sale of 2C-B-BZP could possibly be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act because of its structural similarities to benzylpiperazine. 2C-B-BZP is said to be illegal to possess, use or sell in Japan where it used to be sold in local smartshops. Classifi cation: Stimulant AddendumSection 5B - Chemical Addendum 361 Butylone Method Of Use: Orally - mixed with water drank can taste bitter Dosage: The dosage range is not fully understood but seems to be lower than for MBDB. Description: Butylone, also known as -keto-N- methylbenzodioxolylpropylamine entactogen, psychedelic, and stimulant of the phenethylamine chemical class. It is the -keto analogue of MBDB. History: Butylone was fi rst synthesized by Koeppe, Ludwig and Zeile in 1967. It remained an obscure until 2005 when it was synthesized by a chemical supply company, and has since continued to be sold as a research chemical. It has since been explored as a possible entheogen. Butylone shares the same relationship to MBDB as methylone does to MDMA (\"Ecstasy\"). Formal research on this chemical was fi rst conducted in 2009, when it was shown to be metabolized in a similar manner to related drugs like methylone Short term E ects: Tingling fi ngers, lower arms and body, and behind ears. Breathing shallow, inability to speak, body and hands shaking, heart palpitations, immobility, altered perception, hangover eff ect, lethargy, diminished appetite.

Method of Use: taken in tablet form Description: Dibenzylpiperazine (DBZP) is a piperazine derivative often found as an impurity in the recreational stimulant drug benzylpiperazine (BZP). Presence of DBZP is a marker for low quality or badly made BZP . It can be made as a reaction byproduct during BZP synthesis, either because the reaction has been run at too high a temperature, or because an excess of benzyl chloride has been used.The toxicity of DBZP is unknown. It is not known to have any stimulant eff ects in its own right, although this has not been tested.Substituted piperazines are a broad class of chemical compounds. Best known as recreational stimulants are BZP (Benzylpiperazine), TFMPP , the eff ects of MDMA and used to be referred to as 'Legal highs' . These piperazine compounds are sometimes found in illegal drugs like ecstasy. They are also used in industry to make plastics, resins, pesticides, brake fl uid and a variety of materials and products. Piperazine itself is used as an eff ective worming agent for pets and farm animals. Streetnames for drugs can vary around the country.

Some of these products may have formerly contained GHB) Description: Gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL) Colourless oily liquid with a weak characteristic odor and is soluble in water. Gamma-Butyrolactone is a common solvent and is used in the production of stain removers, paint strippers, pesticides, and herbicides among others.(GBL) is also produced as a result of fermentation and so is found in small quantities in some wines.(the amount of GBL found in wine is insignifi cant and not suffi cient to produce any eff ects. History: Gamma-Butyrolactone or 'club drug' , also sold in health food stores or on the internet with misleading information such as 'natural' product, energy tonic, sleep aid or growth hormones Short Term E ects: (GBL) is currently sold as a 'legal high' . Gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL) is a precursor, - an inactive drug that is converted into an active form of (GHB) in the body by a chemical reaction in the digestive tract. (GBL) is often sold as a substitute for the illegal form (GHB) and comes in plastic bottles (usually 125ml-1litre) in a diluted form (resembling water) E ects: GBL is longer acting and has a shorter onset than GHB. Otherwise, eff ects are similar to GHB, although weight for weight it is signifi cantly more powerful, meaning dosage must be lowered accordingly.

Herbal smoking blends vape off foil JWH 250 is a cannabimimetic indole that shows a high-a nity for both the central cannabinoid (CB1) and the peripheral cannabinoid (CB2) receptors. The a nities of JWH 250 for both CB1 (Ki = 11 nM) and CB2 (Ki = 33 nM) are comparable to those of the traditional cannabinoid, 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC; Ki = 40.7 and 36.4 nM, respectively). Description: JWH-250 (1-pentyl-3-(2-methoxyphenylacetyl)indole) is an analgesic chemical from the phenylacetylindole family, which acts as a cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with a Ki of 11nM at CB1 and 33nM at CB2. Unlike many of the older JWH series compounds, this compound does not have a naphthalene ring, instead occupying this position with a 2'-methoxyphenylacetyl group, making JWH-250 a representative member of a new class of cannabinoid ligands. Other 2'-substituted analogues such as the methyl, chloro and bromo compounds are also active and somewhat more potent. It's rumored to be one of the cannabinoids in herbal blends such as Pandora Potpourri, that is quickly replacing K2 Blends in states where JWH-018 is being banned. Legality: Samples of JWH-250 were fi rst identifi ed in May 2009 by the German Federal Criminal Police, as an ingredient in new generation \"herbal smoking blends\" which had been released since the banning of the original ingredients (C8)-CP 47,497 and JWH-018. Classifi cation: Depressant Pain Killer - Chemical Addendum 367 MBZP Method of Use: Found In Smileys and in pills Description: MBZP (1-methyl-4-benzylpiperazine) is a stimulant drug which is a derivative of benzylpiperazine. MBZP has been sold as an ingredient in legal recreational drugs known as \"Party pills\" , initially in New Zealand and subsequently in other countries around the world. Short Term E ects : The eff ects of MBZP are very similar to those of BZP , but the stimulant eff ect is slightly weaker and it seems to have less of a tendency to cause negative side eff ects such as headaches and nausea. E ects: Anecdotal evidence concludes that there is a speedy trippy eff ect. Stated as being a horrible comedown which can take up to 24 hours, insomnia, hot and cold sensation at one time. Legality: Based on the recommendation of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP , along with Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into eff ect in New Zealand on December 18th 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1st of April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs will remain until October 2008, at which point they will become completely illegal. Classifi cation: StimulantAddendumPsychoactive Substances 368 Classifi cation: (MDBZP; Piperonylpiperazine) is a psychoactive drug of the piperazine chemical class related to benzylpiperazine (BZP). In the book PiHKAL it is speculated that MDBZP might have eff ects similar to the drug 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA; \"Ecstasy\") because of the presence of the 3,4-methylenedioxy group on the benzene ring; however, once the compound was tested in humans this theory was shown to be incorrect. MDBZP has been sold as a \"designer drug\" with supposed recreational properties, and has even been found as an ingredient in street \"Ecstasy\" pills. However, MDBZP is only a very mild stimulant, and does not produce euphoria, empathogenic or psychedelic eff ects. The prominent eff ects produced by MDBZP are dizziness, nausea and headaches, but at high doses it has been known to cause convulsions. MDBZP thus has all of the negative side eff ects of other piperazine derivatives, but without any of the positive eff ects that might make these drugs desirable to consumers. AddendumSection 5B - Chemical Addendum 369 Methcathinone (-methylamino-propiophenone) Method Of Use: The most common route of administration is via nasal insu ation (snorting). Other routes of administration include per os, IV injection and smoking. Duration: The eff ects of methcathinone usually last from four to six hours Street names: Street slang for methcathinone may be confused with methylmethcathinone (mephedrone) and terms may be used interchangibly and include terms such as MCat (pronounced \"em-kat\"), Cat, Meow, Stroof, Katestroof, or Marzipan (from smell during synthesis).In Europe, methcathinone is primarily known as Ephedrone. In the United Kingdom, methylmethcathinone may be known as M-cat. In Australia, methcathinone may be known as ketone or bk (beta ketone). In New Zealand, methcathinone is usually reff ered to as the woolen warrior, or simply wooly. In South Africa it is primarily known as Stroof or occasionally Kat. There, it is also confused (via name alone, not presentation) with Khat (sometimes spelled Qat). Other local slang names include Cadillac Express, Wonder Star, Wild Cat, The C or Gaggers. Description: Methcathinone (-methylamino-propiophenone), is a psychoactive stimulant, sometimes used as a recreational drug and is considered addictive. It is usually snorted, but can be smoked, injected, or taken orally. Long term E ects: it is a potent CNS stimulant and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Chronic high dosage use may result in acute mental confusion ranging from mild paranoia to psychosis. These symptoms typically disappear quickly if use is stopped. Legality: Unlike methamphetamine, methcathinone is not legal under any circumstances in the US due to its classifi cation as a Schedule I substance. Conversely, methamphetamine has certain medical uses such as treatment of morbid obesity, narcolepsy and ADHD. Methcathinone is currently a DEA Schedule I controlled substance in the United States. History: Methcathinone was fi rst synthesized in 1928.[2] It was used in the Soviet Union during the 1930s and 1940s as an anti-depressant. Since the 1960s, methcathinone has been used as a recreational drug in the (former) Soviet Union.Circa 1994, the United States government recommended to the UN Secretary-General that methcathinone should be added to Schedule I of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Chemistry: Methcathinone is \"most Oxidation of ephedrine to methcathinone requires little chemistry experience, making it (relatively) easy to synthesize. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is most commonly used as the oxidant. In clandestine laboratories, synthesizing methcathinone using either potassium permanganate or various chromates is considered undesirable because of the low yields and the high toxicity of these oxidants. A method that yields more methcathinone is oxidizing ephedrine with sodium hypochlorite. If done in a proper laboratory using the proper procedures, however, potassium permanganate can be a high-yielding reactant. Methcathinone as free base is very unstable; it easily loses its ketone and converts back into an alcohol. Structurally, this occurs when the C=O bond at the R-position is converted into a C-OH bond. In other words, basic methcathinone will turn into ephedrine, from which it was synthesized.It does of course need to be acknowledged that for artifi cially produced methcathinone one gets a racemic product, unless they use enantioselective terminology. E.g. making a ketal prior to halogenating their propiophenone, followed by deprotection and methamination.Methcathinone acts on the body and brain much like methamphetamine and amphetamines do. E ects: Methcathinone hydrochloride increases spontaneous rodent locomotor activity potentiates the release of dopamine from dopaminergic nerve terminals in the brain,] and causes appetite suppression. Users can easily forget to consume fl uids leading to increased thirst and dehydration. The eff ects of methcathinone are similar to those of methamphetamine, initially deemed to be less intense by the inexperienced user, and often more euphoric.[The eff ects have been compared to those of cocaine, since it commonly causes hypertension Classifi cation: StimulantAddendumPsychoactive Substances 370 Methcathinone (Continued) (elevated blood pressure) and tachycardia(elevated heart rate). Reported eff ects include: Feelings of euphoria Increased alertness Dilated pupils Rapid breathing Increased heart rate Inability to stop talking Increased empathy and sense of communication Both decreased and increased sexual function and desire Loss of cognitive ability relating to the distinction of relative importance of matters (i.e. one might spend days thinking that he or she is being productive but later realize that the activity and/or product was not even necessary) .Use and pharmacology: Methcathinone has very strong affi nities for the dopamine transporter and the noradrenaline transporter. Its affi nity for the serotonin transporter is less than that of methamphetamine. Methcathinone binges resemble amphetamine binges in that the user may not sleep or eat, and takes in little in the way of liquids. The methcathinone binge is followed by a \"crash\" characterized by long periods of sleep, excess eating, long-lasting nosebleeds and, in some cases, depressionInjecting this substance has recently been associated with symptoms similar to those seen in patients with Parkinson's Disease (Manganism) due to the compound manganese dioxide which is a byproduct of synthesis with permanganate. Addiction: Methcathinone can be highly psychologically addictive, and can produce methamphetamine-like withdrawals, which is somewhat less in intensity than methamphetamine. It is highly unlikely for a methcathinone user to experience addiction on their fi rst or even several subsequent administrations of the drug.Legality: Clinical use: In the US, methcathinone is listed as a Schedule I drug, for which there is no clinical use. Research in the United States without a specifi c DEA permit is also prohibited. In the Netherlands, methylcathinone is listed as a Level I substance of the Opium Law, for which there is no clinical use. In the UK, methcathinone is listed as a Class B drug,]with no clinical uses.Furthermore, anecdotal reports from USENET posts in the 1990s indicate that unlike many stimulants, methcathinone doesn't have the inhibitory eff ects seen in other stimulants that make them useful as medications to treat Attention Defi cit Hyperactivity Disorder. AddendumSection 5B - Chemical Addendum drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and cathinone chemical classes. It is closely related to para-methoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) and methylone, and likely has a similar pharmacological profi le. Short Term E ects: Subjective eff ects have been reported similar to both MDMA and amphetamines, producing responses such as increased sociability, euphoria, disinhibition, energy and stimulation. Physiological responses include pupil dilation; hyperthermia and increased perspiration. Eff ects diff er when used with alcohol or other substances. Hydration is important. Eff ects diff er when used on empty or full stomach. Long Term E ects: As 4-methoxymethcathinone is a relatively new drug with little exposure experienced by humans, there are many concerns for possible ill health eff ects that are currently unknown. It should be noted that some amphetamine analogues containing paramethoxy group are known to cause severe hyperthermia and even death due to concurrent MAOI and monoamine releasing action. Overdosage: The deaths of two young men in southeast Sweden in 2009 were attributed to para-methoxymethcathinone overdosage. Both were comatose when found. One suff ered cardiorespiratory arrest on the way to the hospital, while the second survived for 16 hours in the emergency department. Legality: It is legal in most countries around the world, however classed as narcotics in Sweden, and as a result of this it can be purchased online leading to growing use of the drug. Classifi cation: Stimulant AddendumPsychoactive Substances 372 Methyldioxyprovalerone Description: Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is a psychoactive drug with properties which acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), reportedly methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta). MDPV has no history of FDA approved medical use but has been sold since around 2007 as a research chemical. Short Term E ects: MDPV acts as a stimulant. The acute eff ects may include: physical: rapid heartbeat, increase in blood pressure, vasoconstriction, sweating, mental: increases in alertness & awareness, increased wakefulness and arousal, anxiety, agitation, perception of a diminished requirement for food and sleep. The eff ects have duration of roughly 3 to 4 hours, with after eff ects such as tachycardia, hypertension, and mild stimulation lasting from 6 to 8 hours. High Doses: High doses have been observed to cause intense, prolonged panic attacks in stimulant- intolerant users, and there are anecdotal reports of psychosis from sleep withdrawal and addiction at higher doses or more frequent dosing intervals. MDPV has been remarked about more than once for its powers as an aphrodisiac, which have been said to rival those of methamphetamine when dosed correctly. Users often report to feel compelled to continue re-dosing but then lose interest in taking it quickly because of the unpleasant side eff ects caused by higher doses. Long Term E ects: Extended binges on MDPV have also been reported to produce severe comedown syndrome similar to that of methamphetamine, characterized by depression, lethargy, headache, anxiety, postural hypotension (lightheadedness and weakness of the muscles), and in some cases severely bloodshot eyes. Time is the solution for these symptoms, which usually subside within 4 to 8 hours. Abdominal pain consistent with kidney pain has also been reported when MDPV is used for extended periods of time. MDPV may also cause temporary trismus and/or bruxism. Side eff ects are highly dose-dependant. Chemical Addendum Method Of Use: Inhaled or Methylone, also known as 3,4- methylenedioxy-N-methylcathinone (bk-MDMA) and in the UK as Arlone, is an entactogen, psychedelic, and stimulant of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and cathinone chemical classes. It was originally patented by Peyton Jacob and Alexander Shulgin in 1996 as an antidepressant. It is a very close structural analogue of MDMA (\"Ecstasy\"), diff ering only by the addition of a -ketone group History: In 2004, a new designer drug called \"Explosion\" appeared in the Netherlands. This drug is sold as a liquid via the internet and in Dutch \"smartshops\" (known as \"headshops\" in the United States and some other countries), stores selling non-scheduled psychoactive substances such as Salvia divinorum, Psilocybin MDMA substitutes like BZP and TFMPP . The product is advertised as a \"room odouriser\" and is sold in plastic tubes containing 5 mL of liquid. The tubes cost between \u20ac10 and \u20ac15 and do not present any information about the composition of Explosion; they contain only a label saying \"Room odorizer Vanilla. Do not ingest\" and \"Keep away from children. Never use more than one bottle\" . Users have mentioned ingesting the liquid to reach euphorically-stimulating eff ects similar to those of other phenethylamines such as diethylpropion, bupropion and methcathinone. Analysis of \"Explosion\" has confi rmed that the active ingredient is methylone Short Term E ects: The eff ects of methylone may include the following: Cognitive: Stimulation and arousal, Mood lift, euphoria, and anxiolysis, Sociability, empathy, and bonding, Mild psychedelia, such as enhanced color perception and light mental imagery, Derealization/depersonalization, hallucinations, and psychosis (with high doses and/or excessive use) Peripheral: Tachycardia and hypertension, Hyperthermia and sweating, Mydriasis and nystagmus, Trismus and bruxism, Insomnia and restlessness, Anorexia (loss of appetite), Nausea and vomiting, Most of these eff ects are similar to those of other psychostimulants.
